It produces 2 to 3 semi-erect lateral stems that grow 10 to 15 cm long. It is most closely related to D. purpurascens, but differs by several characteristics including height and petiole length. It is native to a number of swampy locations around Perth south to Pinjarra. It grows in peaty water- logged soils in swamp heathland and flowers from September to October. After a bushfire it will flower en masse.Lowrie, A. 2005. A taxonomic revision of Drosera section Stolonifera (Droseraceae), from south-west Western Australia. Nuytsia, 15(3): 355-393. Drosera stolonifera illustration from Ludwig Diels' 1906 monograph on the Droseraceae The type specimens were collected by Charles von H√ºgel in the Swan River region in 1833. D. stolonifera was formally described by Stephan Endlicher in his Enumeratio plantarum in 1837. For many years, different varieties and morphs of this species were included in the D. stolonifera complex. Several of these forms and varieties were eventually described as subspecies, which were then later elevated to species rank upon further examination. Much of the decision on how to deal with the species complex deals with a discussion of lumpers and splitters. The debate began as early as 1906 when Ludwig Diels reduced Jules √âmile Planchon's D. humilis to a variety of D. stolonifera, thus also creating the autonym D. stolonifera var. stolonifera. Then in 1982 N. G. Marchant described several subspecies: D. stolonifera subsp. compacta, D. stolonifera subsp. humilis, and D. stolonifera subsp. rupicola, which Allen Lowrie restored or elevated to species rank to D. purpurascens, D. humilis, and D. rupicola, respectively. In 1992, Lowrie and Marchant together described several more subspecies: D. stolonifera subsp. monticola, D. stolonifera subsp. porrecta, and D. stolonifera subsp. prostrata. Lowrie restored subsp. porrecta to D. porrecta and elevated subsp. prostrata to D. prostrata in 2005. When publishing the elevation of subspecies monticola to species rank, Lowrie did not include a correct page citation for the basionym, which under Article 33.4 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature made the new combined name invalid. The error has not yet been corrected, so the only two subspecies of D. stolonifera that remain are the autonym D. stolonifera subsp. stolonifera and D. stolonifera subsp. monticola.International Organization for Plant Information (IOPI). \\"Plant Name Search Results\\" (HTML). International Plant Names Index. Retrieved on 28 January 2009. Within subspecies stolonifera, there are two morphs that Lowrie described in 2005, though not formally as a form. He identified a typical variant from the swamplands that grows in peaty, sandy soils in winter-wet heaths and a \\"hills variant\\" that grows in well-drained clayey sands in Jarrah woodlands and becomes redder as the foliage ages.

Conversely, polytheistic pagans may regard the gods of various monotheistic religions as \\"false gods\\" because they do not believe that any real deity possesses the properties ascribed by monotheists to their sole deity. Atheists, who do not believe in any deities, do not usually use the term \\"false god\\" even though that would encompass all deities from the atheist viewpoint. Usage of this term is generally limited to theists, who believe in some deity or deities, but not in others. Remains of Nergal gate in Nineveh, Iraq In Abrahamic doctrines, a false god is a deity or object of worship that is regarded as either illegitimate or non-functioning in its professed authority or capability, and this characterization is further used as a definition of \\"idol\\". Merriam-Webster.com - idol: a false god The term is often used throughout the Bible to compare YHWH, interpreted by Jews and Christians, or Elohim/Allah, interpreted by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, as the only real God. For example, 2 Kings 17:30 (NLV) states, with reference to false gods, \\"The men of Babylon made the false god Succoth-benoth. The men of Cuth made the false god Nergal. The men of Hamath made the false god Ashima\\". An alternative usage of the term \\"false god\\" refers to anything that is considered to assume a place of undue importance in one's life; this usage is reflected in the viewpoint of some that \\"whatever we try to derive our core sense of meaning and worth is our god\\". Present Perfect: Finding God in the Now - Gregory A.

The vast majority of religions in history have been polytheistic, worshiping many diverse deities. The claim to worship the \\"one and only true God\\" came with the arrival of monotheistic religions and is the distinguishing characteristic of monotheism.

By placing the sheet of wood into water, the moisture and heat from the bending iron will reform the structure of the wood, reorganizing the fibers of the wood to prevent the wood from springing back to its original state. This process is usually used for making sides or \\"ribs\\" for violins, guitars, mandolins and other projects, and also for woodworking such as shaker-style pantry boxes. Description Bending irons are most commonly electrically heated, therefore it is possible to control the heat output so as not to overheat the workpiece and change its chemical balance. The iron itself can be purchased in different shapes and sizes to better accommodate the needs of the operator. Some shapes include teardrop, round, and oval. Process To properly bend a sheet of wood, there are a few techniques that will help. The hardness of the wood will determine how long is required to soak the wood in water. The harder the wood, the more time is needed to fully soak the wood, making it easier to bend and preventing the wood from springing back to its original form. Popular hardwoods are oak, maple, cherry, birch, walnut, ash and poplar. Common softwoods are pine, fir, spruce, hemlock, cedar and redwood. A metal mold, or former, placed on the back of the wood while heat bending can help ensure that all the bends and curves are done to the requirements of the project being made. Steel or iron are usually avoided, as iron can react with moist timber to produce rust staining, or some tannin-rich woods such as oak or chestnut will provide indelible blue-black iron tannates. After heat bending the wood, clamping the wood into a solid mold will reinforce the bends made to the wood while drying, preventing the wood from straightening while it dries.

He also studied with Archipenko in Chicago that year, and in 1939 attended the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he studied with Carl Milles. From 1942 to 1946, he served in the US Army, attending the Corps of Engineers Officer Candidate School in Virginia. Later he became a unit commander in England. In 1945, he taught at American University for the education of GIs in Biarritz, France. Public Art Named a public art legend by Sam Hunter, professor and art critic, Tony Rosenthal created monumental public art sculptures for seven decades; Tony Rosenthal received his first public art commission when he created \\"A Nubian Slave\\" for the 1939 World's Fair. For two decades the artist created sculpture as \\"Bernard Rosenthal', his birth name. In 1960 Tony Rosenthal met and started exhibiting with legendary art dealer Sam Kootz who eventually became Rosenthal's exclusive art dealer, who also represented Pablo Picasso. Kootz encouraged Rosenthal to abandon figurative sculpture and create abstract geometric sculpture which won the artist even wider acclaim. Kootz also encouraged Rosenthal to use his nickname, \\"Tony\\", and beginning 1960, Rosenthal was professionally known and credited as Tony Rosenthal for all art created by the artist. Tony Rosenthal's \\"Alamo\\", the monumental 15 foot Cor- Ten steel sculpture, also known as the \\"Astor Place Cube\\" is the most famous Rosenthal public art sculpture. Tony Rosenthal \\"Alamo\\", 1967, was first installed at Astor Place as part of Doris Freedman's \\"Sculpture in Environment\\" Installation, sponsored by the New York Administration of Recreation & Cultural Affairs and now one of five public art sculptures in New York City by Tony Rosenthal. Edward Albee, three-time Pulitzer Prize winning playwright was a friend and collector of Tony Rosenthal. In the introduction to the \\"Tony Rosenthal,\\" Monograph edited by Sam Hunter, published by Rizzoli, 1999, Edward Albee said \\"Tony works in all sizes. His monumental outdoor pieces, set in landscapes or in busy city spaces, seem always to have been there. His more intimate Wall Sculptures and standing forms have a monumentality no matter what their actual size. Like all the important metal workers - like Stankiewicz, like Caro, like Serra, like Chamberlain - Rosenthal's objects instruct us, alter our perceptions, disturb and thrill us by their audacity, their wonder and their inevitability.\\" Rosenthal exhibited all over the world in solo and group shows.

The Technique was created by Dennis Grubbs, an employee of Procter & Gamble at the time. It was introduced on a test basis in 1975. In 1980, the product was launched nationally as a competitor to Kraft Foods' Sanka. The coffee was advertised as being \\"97% caffeine free.\\" Procter & Gamble's national launch of the beverage received a heavy marketing push with print ads and national TV advertisements, some featured prominently on P&G;'s soap operas. High Point is mainly known today by its television advertisements. Initial marketing centered on the slogan \\"Decaffeinate the ones you love.\\" A year later, the campaign was ditched in favor of a celebrity endorsement. Several famous TV spots featured Lauren Bacall extolling the virtues of the decaffeinated brew. Bacall claimed that High Point was \\"a coffee-lover's dream\\" due to its special way of \\"capturing flavor - deep brewed flavor.\\" Another commercial featured the actress in the back of a limo, saying that \\"Rushing for an eight 'o clock curtain every night means giving up a lot of things - but coffee ISN'T ONE OF 'EM!\\" One memorable ad featured Bacall backstage at rehearsal, commenting that \\"Around here, we don't LIKE coffee - we LOVE it!\\" Subsequent ads did not feature Bacall, but instead focused on homemakers and female executives who wanted coffee without the caffeine and the bitterness. Initial sales of the product were good, and P&G; made a serious push to unseat Sanka. The product was given a packaging redesign in the mid-1980s. The label changed from bold orange and brown coloring to a more homestyle look featuring greens and tans. High Point coffee was discontinued by P&G; in 1993.

The ultimate objective was to maintain the balance of power in Europe to stop any one alliance or country becoming too strong. It takes its name from the quadrille, a dance in which the participants constantly swap partners. The most widely cited instance was in 1756, when Britain and Austria abandoned their 25-year-long Anglo-Austrian Alliance and instead made new alliances with their former enemies, France and Prussia, respectively. That was known as the Diplomatic Revolution. Background Shifting alliances had long been a factor in European politics and were often regarded as responses to shifting power and threat. During the 16th century and the early 17th century, much of the emphasis in European politics had been on restricting the power of Spain. In the second half of the 17th century, Spain was replaced by France as Europe's leading power, soon after replaced by Great Britain. Several European coalitions were formed against Spain and France, culminating in the War of the Spanish Succession, from 1702 to 1713. Quadrille The quadrille was a popular dance of the 18th century. Because of its similarity to the way in which Great Powers swapped partners, the term was swiftly applied to describe it. In the years immediately after the war, Britain and France, which were widely considered to have been the leaders of opposing coalitions in the last war, formed an Anglo- French Alliance and recognized that they shared temporary, mutual interests. In the years that followed, they managed to defeat a resurgent Spain, formerly a French ally, in the War of the Quadruple Alliance. Spain sought an alliance with Austria and gained it in 1725. By 1731 Britain and France were clearly drifting apart. A diplomatic initiative with Austria was begun by the British government, and a new Anglo-Austrian Alliance was created. Spain withdrew its friendship with Austria and eventually ended up allied to France again. In 1733, however the Anglo-Austrian Alliance seemed under threat, when the British failed to assist the Austrians in the War of the Polish Succession. Austria had to rely heavily on Russia for assistance and was forced to make huge concessions to France in the 1738 peace treaty. Britain realised that its failure to intervene had allowed France to become too strong. The stately quadrille reached its height in 1756, when several new alliances formed as a result of the Diplomatic Revolution. In 1740, Prussia, an emerging power, attacked Austria. Britain and France soon became embroiled in the war, which ended in a stalemate in 1748, but Austria appeared to have lost most in the war. Despite extensive British funding, it was increasingly disillusioned about the Anglo-Austrian Alliance and began looking for a replacement. In 1756, Austria did what was considered unthinkable by many by abandoning its British connection to form a new alliance with France. Fearing that Continental Europe would be destabilized and led to war, Britain made an alliance with Prussia at the Convention of Westminster in the hope that a new balance of power would prevent war. Decline The concept began to fade in the second half of the 18th century, as Britain and France became the dominant European powers. The failure to prevent the Seven Years' War, in which over a million died, was a major factor. States began to seek a more stable and long- lasting series of alliances: one of the most successful in the second half of the century was the Bourbon Family Compact between France and Spain, which endured throughout a number of major European conflicts, including the Wars of Austrian and Polish Successions and the Seven Years' War and endured past the American War of Independence in which French and Spanish support contributed towards British defeat. After the Napoleonic Wars, a Concert of Europe was set up to create a forum for discussion rather than create shifting alliance patterns, which had a tendency to cause major wars. This was successful through most of the 19th century, until World War I collapsed the post- Napoleonic system amid increasingly acute nationalist tensions, which led to the formation of Germany and the collapse of the Austrian, Russian, and Ottoman empires.

Vectorcardiography was developed by E. Frank in the mid 1950s. Since the human body is a three-dimensional structure, the basic idea is to construct three orthogonal leads containing all the electric information. The three leads are represented by right-left axis (X), head-to-feet axis (Y) and front-back (anteroposterior) axis (Z). To calculate Frank's leads X, Y and Z using the standard leads system, the following expressions are used: X = -(-0.172 V1 - 0.074 V2 + 0.122 V3 + 0.231 V4 + 0.239 V5 + 0.194 V6 + 0.156 DI - 0.010 DII) (1) Y = (0.057 V1 - 0.019 V2 - 0.106 V3 - 0.022 V4 + 0.041 V5 + 0.048 V6 - 0.227 DI + 0.887 DII) (2) Z = -(-0.229 V1 - 0.310 V2 - 0.246 V3 - 0.063 V4 + 0.055 V5 + 0.108 V6 + 0.022 DI + 0.102 DII) (3) There are different criteria how at to evaluate a vectorcardiogram created by various researchers. Grygoriy Risman presents these different methods, which were developed over half a century and offers an advanced approach called spatial vectorcardiometry (SVCM). The original Russian thesis is filed in the Odessa Medical Academy. __TOC__ Spatial QRS-T angle The spatial QRS-T angle (SA) is derived from a vectorcardiogram, which is a three-dimensional representation of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) created with a computerized matrix operation. The SA is the angle of deviation between two vectors; the spatial QRS-axis representing all of the electrical forces produced by ventricular depolarization and the spatial T-axis representing all the electrical forces produced by ventricular repolarization. The SA is indicative of the difference in orientation between the ventricular depolarization and repolarization sequence. In healthy individuals, the direction of ventricular depolarization and repolarization is relatively reversed; this creates a sharp SA. There is high individual variability and gender difference in the magnitude of the SA. The mean, normal SA in healthy young adult females and males is 66¬∞ and 80¬∞, respectively, and very similar magnitudes are found in the elderly population (65 years and older). In ECG analysis, the SA is categorized into normal (below 105¬∞), borderline abnormal (105‚Äì135¬∞) and abnormal (greater than 135¬∞). A broad SA results when the heart undergoes pathological changes and is reflected in a discordant ECG. A large SA indicates an altered ventricular repolarization sequence, and may be the result of structural and functional myocardial changes that induce regional shortening in action potential duration and impaired ion channel functioning. Current standard ECG markers of repolarization abnormalities include ST depression, T wave inversion and QT prolongation. Many studies have investigated the prognostic strength of the SA for cardiac morbidity and mortality compared to these and other ECG parameters. In treated hypertensive patients, the SA was significantly larger in patients with elevated blood pressure compared to those with lower blood pressure values and a discrimination between patients with high and low blood pressure could not be detected using other ECG parameters. In the Rotterdam Study with men and women aged 55 years and older, having an abnormal SA significantly increased the hazard ratios for cardiac death, sudden cardiac death, non-fatal cardiac events (infarction, coronary interventions) and total mortality. Independently, the SA was a stronger risk indicator of cardiac mortality compared to the other cardiovascular and ECG risk factors analyzed. The Women's Health Initiative study concluded that a wide SA was the strongest predictor for incident coronary heart failure risk and a dominant risk factor for all cause mortality compared to several other ECG parameters. The SA also increases accuracy of diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Using only conventional ECG criteria to diagnose LVH the diagnostic accuracy was 57%, however the inclusion of the SA significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy to 79%. The SA is not routinely measured in clinical ECG examination even though the computerized vectorcardiography software is widely available, efficient and is not affected by observational biases unlike other ECG parameters. The SA is a sensitive marker of repolarization aberrations and with further research support the SA will likely become clinically applied in predicting cardiac morbidity and mortality. A simplified criteria in using the vectorcardiogram has the ability to identify patients with a diaphragmatic infarction not apparent in the electrocardiogram.

The sixth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and second hurricane of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season, Darby developed from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on July 12. After crossing into the Eastern Pacific, the storm became a tropical depression on June 26. The system steadily intensified, and became a hurricane on 000 UTC July 28. Darby peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, though it quickly deteriorated due to cooler waters and increasing wind shear. While Darby dissipated on August 1, the remnants of the tropical cyclone affected the Hawaiian Islands. The system produced high waves and heavy rainfall that led to extensive flash flooding. Numerous roads were closed, while minor landslides and rockslides were reported. Despite the effects, no fatalities or severe damages occurred. Meteorological history A tropical wave emerged from the west coast of Africa on July 12 and entered the Atlantic Ocean. The wave progressed westward, crossing the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea before crossing into the Eastern Pacific on July 20. The west began to exhibit signs of development on July 23. The next day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted an associated area of showers and thunderstorms, indicating that gradual development was possible. The system had become better organized and on July 25, the NHC continued to remark upon the potential for the weak low pressure area--accompanied by disorganized convective activity-- to develop. On July 26, the system became better-organized, and under favorable conditions it was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1200 UTC, while located about to the south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge of high pressure, the depression continued moving westward. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression contained a somewhat well-defined low-level center of circulation, as well as convective banding. Based on Dvorak classifications, the storm was upgraded to a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on July 27; as the fourth tropical storm of the 2004 season, it was named Darby by the NHC. Darby continued to intensify, with established outflow and a well-defined banding feature. Later that day, forecasters predicted the storm to peak as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Darby was upgraded to a hurricane at 0000 UTC on July 28, at which time it began to turn towards the northwest. An eye, embedded within the deep convection, developed later in the day. Darby attained Category 2 intensity at around 1800 UTC, and it rapidly strengthened to Category 3, becoming the first Eastern Pacific major hurricane since Hurricane Kenna of the 2002 season. Shortly after peaking in intensity, Darby moved over coolers waters and began to deteriorate. The eye became less well- defined and the associated convection started weakening. Increasingly colder waters and growing wind shear continued to affect Darby, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm on July 30. The low-level center of circulation became exposed from the thunderstorm activity, and the storm quickly degenerated into a swirl of clouds, although it maintained tropical storm strength. On July 31, it weakened to a tropical depression. Darby soon crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, and it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on August 1. However, its remnants continued westward under the low-level trade winds, and dropped heavy rainfall on Hawaii several days after the cyclone dissipated. Impact The remnants of Darby approaching Hawaii on August 2 Upon reaching the Hawaiian Islands, the remnants of Darby contributed to heavy rainfall and high winds, prompting the issuance of flash flood watch. Along the eastern shores of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and the Island of Hawaii, the system generated swells. The Honolulu Airport reported a daily record of of rainfall, breaking the previous record of set in 1948. Elsewhere, parts of Maui reported in excess of of precipitation, while fell on Oahu. The rainfall was beneficial in some areas, where dry conditions had persisted. Although crop damage from the storm system was limited, some farming operations were postponed and some coffee and nut trees were damaged. Along the eastern shores of several Hawaiian Islands, the storm system triggered surf of . The heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding throughout several areas. On Oahu, roads and some structures were flooded, and minor landslides were reported. On the island, telephone and electrical service were disrupted. At one location, a large boulder rolled down a hillside and struck a fire hydrant; firefighters were called to shut it off. On Kauai, the Wailua River exceeded flood stage on August 4. Small stream and drainage ditch flooding was reported in the Kau District of Hawaii. Excessive runoff around Kailua-Kona resulted in extensive flooding that forced the closure of five schools, submerged several roads, and triggered rockslides. Due to high water, several roads, including part of the Piilani Highway on Maui, were temporarily shut down. A portion of the Kamehameha Highway was also closed after being submerged under waters of up to deep. Despite the flooding, neither Darby nor its remnant moisture caused any casualties or severe property damage.

This backpack-mounted unit was the first radio to be nicknamed a \\"walkie talkie\\".  History  In 1940, Motorola (then the Galvin Manufacturing Company) received a contract from the War Department to develop a portable, battery powered voice radio receiver/transmitter for field use by infantry units. The project engineering team consisted of Daniel E. Noble, who conceived of the design using frequency modulation, Henryk Magnuski who was the principal RF engineer, Marion Bond, Lloyd Morris, and Bill Vogel. The SCR-300 operated in the 40.0 to 48.0 MHz frequency range, and was channelized. Along with other mobile FM tank and artillery radios such as the SCR-508 (20.0 to 27.9 MHz) and the SCR-608 (27.0 to 38.9 MHz), the SCR-300 marked the beginning of the transition of combat-net radio from low-HF AM/CW to low-VHF FM. Although a relatively large backpack-carried radio rather than a handheld model, the SCR-300 was described in War Department Technical Manual TM-11-242 as \\"primarily intended as a walkie-talkie for foot combat troops\\", and so the term \\"walkie-talkie\\" first came into use. The final acceptance tests took place at Fort Knox, Kentucky in Spring 1942. The performance of the SCR-300 during those tests demonstrated its capacity to communicate through interference and the rugged quality of the design. Motorola was to produce nearly 50,000 of the SCR-300 units during the course of World War II. The SCR-300 saw action in the Pacific Theater, beginning in New Georgia in August 1943. Colonel Ankenbrandt informed General Meade that \\"they are exactly what is needed for front line communications in this theater\\". In his point of view, the main difficulty was keeping them supplied with fresh batteries. The SCR-300 saw heavy use in the Normandy invasion and the Italian campaign. It also became \\"key equipment\\" that helped deter confusion in the Battle of the Bulge. The British adopted the design of the SCR-300 for their own use from 1947 as the \\"Wireless Set No. 31\\". Alt URL  Specifications  Signal Corps Radio set SCR-300-A The SCR-300 was an 18-tube battery operated radio transceiver. It used an FM transmitter section and a double superheterodyne receiver.

(1976) An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures, \\"Hags\\", p.216. Hags are often seen as malevolent, but may also be one of the chosen forms of shapeshifting deities, such as The Morr√≠gan or Badb, who are seen as neither wholly benevolent nor malevolent.Lysaght, Patricia.

All of these words are derived from the Proto-Germanic *hagatusjon- which is of unknown origin; the first element may be related to the word \\"hedge\\".hag1 The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition (2000) As a stock character in fairy or folk tale, the hag shares characteristics with the crone, and the two words are sometimes used as if interchangeable. Using the word \\"hag\\" to translate terms found in non-English (or non-modern English) is contentious, since use of the word is often associated with misogyny. In folklore A hag, or \\"the Old Hag\\", was a nightmare spirit in English and anglophone North American folklore. This variety of hag is essentially identical to the Old English m√¶ra‚Äîa being with roots in ancient Germanic superstition, and closely related to the Scandinavian mara. According to folklore, the Old Hag sat on a sleeper's chest and sent nightmares to him or her. When the subject awoke, he or she would be unable to breathe or even move for a short period of time. In the Swedish film Marianne (2011), the main character suffers from such nightmares. This state is now called sleep paralysis, but in the old belief, the subject was considered \\"hagridden\\".Ernsting, Michele (2004) \\"Hags and nightmares: sleep paralysis and the midnight terrors\\" Radio Netherlands It is still frequently discussed as if it were a paranormal state.The \\"Old Hag\\" Syndrome from About: Paranormal Phenomena Many stories about hags seem to have been used to frighten children into being good. The Northern English Peg Powler, for example, was a river hag who lived in the River Tees and had skin the colour of green pond scum.Ghosts, Helpful and Harmful by Elliott O'DonnellIntroduction to Folklore by Marian Roalfe CoxThe History and Antiquities of the Parish of Darlington, in the Bishoprick by William Hylton Dyer Longstaffe, 1854 Parents who wanted to keep their children away from the river's edge told them that if they got too close to the water, she would pull them in with her long arms, drown them, and sometimes eat them.

Jenny Greenteeth from Yorkshire, and Nelly Longarms from several English counties.Froud, Brian and Lee, Alan. (1978) Faeries. New York, Peacock Press Many tales about hags do not describe them well enough to distinguish between an old woman who knows magic, or a witch or supernatural being.K. M. Briggs, The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature, p 66-7 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967 In Slavic folklore, Baba Yaga was a hag who lived in the woods in a house on chickens legs. She would often ride through the forest on a mortar, sweeping away her tracks with a broom.Russian Folk-Tales W. R. S. Ralston, Forgotten Books, , . p.170 Though she is usually a single being, in some folktales three Baba Yagas are depicted as helping the hero in his quest, either by giving advice or by giving gifts.W. R. S. Ralston. Songs of the Russian People Section III.--Storyland Beings. In Irish and Scottish mythology, the cailleach is a hag goddess concerned with creation, harvest, the weather, and sovereignty. In partnership with the goddess Br√≠d, she is a seasonal goddess, seen as ruling the winter months while Br√≠d rules the summer. In Scotland, a group of hags, known as The Cailleachan (The Storm Hags) are seen as personifications of the elemental powers of nature, especially in a destructive aspect. They are said to be particularly active in raising the windstorms of spring, during the period known as A Chailleach. Hags as sovereignty figures abound in Irish mythology. The most common pattern is that the hag represents the barren land, who the hero of the tale must approach without fear, and come to love on her own terms. When the hero displays this courage, love, and acceptance of her hideous side, the sovereignty hag then reveals that she is also a young and beautiful goddess. The Three Fates (particularly Atropos) are often depicted as hags. She is similar to Lilith of the Torah, Old Testament. In Western literature In mediaeval and later literature, the term \\"hag\\", and its relatives in European languages, came to stand for an unattractive, older woman. Building on the mediaeval tradition of such women as portrayed in comic and burlesque literature, specifically in the Italian Renaissance, the hag represented the opposite of the lovely lady familiar from the poetry of Petrarch. The hag as a fantastic creature has also been used in some fantasy novels, such as the contemporary Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. Hags are depicted as a species of ugly, child-eating women with numerous warts. In The Heroes or Greek Fairy Tales For My Children, Charles Kingsley characterized Scylla as \\"Scylla the sea hag\\". The term Sea Hag was later popularized in the 20th-century United States as the name for a Popeye comic strip character. In neurobiology The expression Old Hag Attack refers to a hypnagogic state in which paralysis is present. Quite often, it is accompanied by terrifying hallucinations. When excessively recurrent, some psychiatrists and physicians consider these attacks to be a disorder. Many populations treat such incidents as part of their culture and mythological worldview, rather than any form of disease or pathology.

It is within the London Borough of Hackney and is considered to be a part of London‚Äôs East End. It is about 3.1 miles (5 km) northeast of Charing Cross. The adjacent neighbourhoods are Dalston (to the north), Hoxton (to the west) and Bethnal Green (to the south east). Haggerston historically formed part of Shoreditch borough, and was divided into the following ecclesiastical parishes: All Saints, St Chad, St Columba, St Mary, St Paul, St Augustine, and St Stephen.http://mapco.net/parish/parish.htm In 1965, the Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch became part of the new London Borough of Hackney. There is an electoral ward called Haggerston within the borough. In the 1990s a number of the area's more rundown housing estates were refurbished and some disused public buildings were privately converted into gated communities. In 2010, Haggerston Railway station re-opened, a little to the north of the original station.  History  Haggerston is first recorded in the Domesday Book as Hergotestane, possibly of Viking origin, and an outlying hamlet of Shoreditch. On Rocque's 1745 map of Hackney, the village is shown as Agostone but by the 19th century it had become Haggerstone, and part of the growing urban sprawl, with factories and streets of workers' cottages lining the canal.  Today  The proximity to Hoxton and Shoreditch has made the area popular with students and workers in the creative industries, as these nearby areas have grown more expensive. In recent years, escalating property prices have driven commercial art galleries further into east London, which has exacerbated this effect. For the same reason, Haggerston has been attracting tech start ups over Silicon Roundabout in Old Street, with some people calling the area \\"Hackerston\\". A shortage of secondary school places has made the area less attractive to families but this is likely to change with the building of a The Bridge Academyon Laburnum Street.  Governance  The Haggerston electoral ward forms part of the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency. The ward returns three councillors to Hackney Council, with an election every four years. At the election on 6 May 2010, Ann Munn, Jonathan McShane, and Barry Buitekant, all Labour Party candidates, were returned. Turnout was 54 per cent; with 5,006 votes cast.Council Elections 2006 results for Haggerston (LB Hackney) accessed 11 May 2010 Current councillors (2020) for the Haggerston ward are Ajay Chauhan, Humaira Garasia and Patrick Spence.  Geography  Education  Secondary schools in the area include Haggerston School and The Bridge Academy.  Landmarks  Haggerston School is a Grade II listed building, designed by the modernist architect Ern≈ë Goldfinger and built in 1964‚Äì65.  Culture  Gasometers at Haggerston Gasworks viewed from the Regent's Canal, October 2005 Besides the Regent's Canal, Haggerston Park, on the site of a demolished gasworks on Hackney Road, provides much-needed open space in the area. Also in the area is the Hackney City Farm. The Regent Estate provides the Regent Estate Pensioners Club/Hall and the Regent Estate Community Centre/Hall which together provide community services and spaces for hire. The Regent Estate Pensioners Hall is also used as a polling station. The Grade II listed Haggerston Pool, designed by Alfred Cross and opened in 1904, was closed in 2000. In June 2009, after a long community campaign, a ¬£5m grant was announced from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to refurbish and reopen the pool. The building would also contain community facilities and a GP surgery.June 2009; Cash for historic baths‚Äîwhat the Edwardians did for us Peter Sherlock 25 June 2009 (Hackney Gazette) accessed 27 June 2009 This area of Hackney has a long association with clowning.

Public art The condemned Haggerston and Kingsland Estate was scheduled for demolition in the 1990s but the process did not get underway for another 20 years. In 2009 the artists Andrea Luka Zimmerman and Lasse Johansson, who lived on the Haggerston Estate on Dunston Road, created the I AM HERE project, placing on the building large portrait photographs of the current estate residents who were about to be moved out so the building could be demolished. These faced the Regent's Canal and were popular with passersby. The project came down in April 2014. A feature film Estate, a Reverie (83 mins, Zimmerman) about the Haggerston estate was completed in 2015. Filmed over seven years, Estate, a Reverie reveals and celebrates the resilience of residents who are profoundly overlooked by media representations and wider social responses. The film was nominated for several awards, including the 2015 Grierson awards. On the Kingsland Estate in Whiston Road, Egyptian painter Nazir Tanbouli created the \\"King's Land\\" project where, in the space of four months, he covered all of the buildings of the condemned estate with murals. The Kingsland Estate was demolished in late 2013.  Little Sisters of Jesus  The Little Sisters of Jesus are a Roman Catholic community of religious sisters inspired by the life and writings of Charles de Foucauld, founded in Algeria in 1939 by Little Sister Magdeleine of Jesus (Madeleine Hutin).

Background \\"Respect\\" was the group's fourth and final studio album under contract to A&M;, and Hitchcock's last record with the Egyptians. The album contains ten Hitchcock originals. The album has a Hitchcock oil painting on its front cover entitled \\"Red Lemon Days\\", which was the original title for the album. The release includes a Hitchcock written short story, \\"Moose Mark and the Prince of Cones\\", in its inlay. The album was written and recorded in the period following the death of Hitchcock's father, and several songs reflect this explicitly, particularly the opening track. Recording The album was recorded on a mobile recording unit at Hitchcock's then home in Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight. Hitchcock explained the decision by saying, \\"I've never really cared much for going in and recording in the studio, so it seemed like the easiest solution was to have the studio come to record with us.\\" The band rehearsed at the house over the summer and then when it came time to record, the group and their respective wives, family and friends all stayed at the house while production took place. Most of the recording was done in the living room, where the furniture had been removed and carpets pulled up. The kitchen was chosen for the vocals because of its good acoustics. Hitchcock has said that he does not like the record. Although he thinks the songs are good he was not happy with the end result. He partly blames this on how unsettled his life was at that time, saying: \\"I was ... at a bit of a fault line in my life. I was going back and forth across the Atlantic all the time, and wasn‚Äôt really properly focused on how it came out.\\" The extended time it took to record the album meant that he lost focus and since then has made a point of making records in short two- or three-day bursts.

Central to the Livescribe platform is the smartpen, a ballpoint pen with an embedded computer and digital audio recorder. When used with Anoto digital paper, it records what it writes for later uploading to a computer, and synchronizes those notes with any audio it has recorded. This allows users to replay portions of a recording by tapping on the notes they were taking at the time the recording was made. It is also possible to select which portion of a recording to replay by clicking on the relevant portion of a page on-screen, once it has been synced to the Livescribe Desktop software. Jim Marggraff, inventor of the LeapFrog FLY Pentop computer and creator of the LeapPad Learning System, left Leapfrog in 2005 to form Livescribe. In November 2015, Livescribe announced its acquisition by Anoto for $15m. The smartpen The Livescribe Echo Pen A Livescribe smartpen is about the size and weight of a large pen (5/8\\" x 6 1/8\\"), and is equipped with a removable ball-point ink cartridge, a microphone to record audio, a speaker for playback, a small OLED display, an infra-red camera, and internal flash memory that captures handwritten notes, audio and drawings. The user can choose to record audio in addition to the handwritten text. Recorded audio is kept indexed with the handwritten text‚Äîtapping on a written word starts playback of the recorded audio from that part of the recording. The smartpen allows the installation of as many applications as there is memory, and ships with several applications. If tapped on the correct images, it can function as a calculator, for example, or can translate words (the translator software as shipped includes only 21 words in a small selection of languages - as of September 2010 there are no public plans to make a full version of this translator available ). Livescribe has made four versions of its smartpen: Pulse, Echo, Sky Wi-Fi (or Livescribe Wi-Fi), and Livescribe 3. The pens can store about 100 hours of audio per gigabyte. * The Pulse smartpen, released in March 2008, is available with either 1, 2 or 4 Gigabytes of flash storage. It requires a special USB cradle and uses a 2.5mm headphone jack. * The Echo smartpen, released in July 2010, comes with either 2GB, 4GB or 8 GB of memory. Compared to the Pulse smartpen, it is less round in shape and uses more standardized connection ports. The Echo integrates with the Desktop software via a standard micro USB cable and can connect to headphones with a more common 3.5-millimeter jack. * In October 2012, Livescribe announced the Sky Wi-Fi smartpen, which uses Wi-Fi to transfer the notes and audio to Evernote without using the proprietary Livescribe Desktop software. In the European Union, this product is sold as the \\"Livescribe Wi-Fi smartpen\\" due to a trademark dispute with BSkyB. * On November 2013, the Livescribe 3 was released. This uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BT 4.0) to store the page content and audio on a smart phone. The physical design made key changes. The OLED screen and the microphone were omitted and the smart phone's display and microphone were used instead. The pen's battery life improved and also still holds the written page content. Availability for operating systems The product was initially available only for use with Microsoft Windows-based computers, but version 1.0 of Livescribe Desktop for the Mac was made available via download in March 2009. It requires OS X 10.5.5 or higher, and was one of nine products designated as \\"Best of Show\\" at Macworld Expo 2009. There is no official Linux version at this time, however, there have been efforts to make the product work with Linux, such as LibreScribe and Smartpen-Browser. Livescribe has provided a user forum at the request of Linux users. Apple's release of Snow Leopard caused functionality and compatibility issues with Livescribe's driver installation. On 31 August 2009, Livescribe released beta 1.2 which fixes all compatibility issues, albeit those who previously tried to install the old software would need to manually delete the old file extension. Handwriting recognition functionality is provided by a third-party application, MyScript by Vision Objects Inc., which sells separately for $29.95. As of August 2009, this is available on both Microsoft Windows and Mac (Intel-processor) systems. The Livescribe 3 currently has support on iOS and Android. It does not have support on Windows or Windows Phone. Paper, applications, and sharing LiveScribe Dot Paper Livescribe's special paper that allows the recording of notes uses a patented dot- positioning system licensed from Anoto. =The pattern= As with all Anoto pattern-based pens, the smartpen can only determine its position on the page when used with paper pre-printed with the dot pattern. Livescribe sells notebooks in several styles, and users can also print their own dot paper with a laser printer capable of at least 600 dpi. (A color or monochrome laser printer works.) The Anoto pattern consists of numerous small black dots in patterns that are essentially invisible to the human eye, but can be detected by the pen's infrared camera. The pattern indicates the exact position of the digital pen on the page, and each page has a unique identity so that they can be distinguished from each other.R =Sharing= Notes and audio can be sent to other users as a \\"pencast\\" through the Livescribe Desktop software. The Livescribe Connect service, launched in May 2011, allows pencasts to be sent through e-mail, Evernote, Facebook, Google Docs, and other methods. These can also be saved as an interactive Pencast PDF that can be viewed with versions 10 and higher of Adobe Reader. While compatibility with OneNote 2010 was initially available, LiveScribe has not provided connectivity support for OneNote 2013. Developer tools Livescribe developed a Penlet SDK to allow application development for the smartpen. The SDK was based on Java, and applications ran directly on the pen itself. Applications could display text and menus, as well as produce audio feedback. A Desktop SDK for Microsoft and Macintosh operating systems was also promised, to allow developers to access files stored on the pen. On June 2, 2009, Livescribe announced the pre-release version of the SDK 1.0 for Windows at the 2009 JavaOne Conference. This was followed in December 2009, with the announcement of the global developer challenge to \\"...encourage the creation of compelling applications for the Pulse smartpen in 2010 and beyond.\\" On April 27, 2010, Livescribe announced the winners of the Developer Challenge: *People's Choice Grand Prize Winner: nodewave MasterMind by Michel Bagnol *Expert Panel Grand Prize Winner: Audible Healthcare by Charles Caraher *People's Choice Category Winners Productivity  nodewave SwissKnife All-in-One by Michel Bagnol Entertainment  Sudoku by Chris Rogers Education  iDK Words/Thesaurus by Phil Trevino; SpellingMe by Brad Rippe In July 2011, Livescribe announced the closure of its third-party developer program. Livescribe‚Äôs official reason for shutting the development program was to concentrate on \\"cloud access, storage and services.\\" The closure of the developer program upset the developer community who had invested in the program, many of whom maintain an active campaign to convince Livescribe to bring back the program. Use and reception From March 2008 through July 2010, Livescribe sold 400,000 . About thirty percent of the customers are college students, while the majority are professionals in fields such as journalism, law, or sales. Some universities issue Livescribe's products to students with learning disabilities to reduce the anxiety related to note-taking. PC World rated the original Livescribe Pulse pen 93/100. A September 2011 review in the Associated Press compared the Livescribe Echo pen to an iPad for the purpose of note-taking and concluded that the Echo is \\"the best tool\\".Svensson, Peter (September 14, 2011). \\"Livescribe smartpen is iPad's opposite\\". Associated Press. Retrieved August 19, 2012. Livescribe was named one of BusinessWeeks \\"Fifty Best Tech Startups\\" in June 2009. Awards earned by Livescribe include the Codie award, the Editor's Choice Award of MacLife, and the Silicon Valley Business Journal's Emerging Tech Award. Some users have noted that ambient noise can be a problem. The built-in microphone on the pen can pick up small amounts of noise from writing on paper, and adjacent ambient noise is often louder than a far away speaker. However, the included headphones have embedded microphones that reduce this ambient noise. (Headphones for the Echo must be purchased separately). The smartpen's portable size and audio recording capabilities have led some people to question the ethics and legality of using the device. For example, in 2009, Delta Air Lines accused the manager of Atlanta's airport of using a Livescribe pen to illegally record a meeting of city and airline officials without their consent. The City of Atlanta concluded an investigation of this matter the following year and failed to find sufficient evidence that the airport manager intentionally sought to record the airline's private conversations. Livescribe urges its customers to \\"behave ethically and demonstrate common courtesy when it comes to personal privacy\\" as they would with common devices such as cameras and cellular telephones. Some users have expressed frustration with the perceived lack of responsiveness to requests for functionality improvements. Among the most requested improvements are the ability to print forms onto dot pattern paper and a day planner for use with the pen system. These requests began to surface soon after release of the pen system, however responses from the company are infrequent and tend to be perfunctory.Note low ratio of participation by company personnel in previously cited forum threads. OLED problems There appear to be design flaws with the OLED display or possibly with the firmware on the Pulse, Echo and Sky (WiFi) models. The OLED fades after one to three years, making the pen significantly more difficult to use because it is no longer possible to see if the pen is on or not and customers need to rely on the audio feedback alone. This fading issue is a known disadvantage of OLEDs and results in a limited lifespan. Users have complained to Livescribe, and the company's official response is to point users to tips on pen maintenance and then suggest that users buy a new pen at a deep discount as a replacement. Some users who received a replacement saw it plagued by the same problem. However, the company has taken advantage of ongoing improvements in OLED technology and, as of January 1, 2015, now offers a 3-year warranty on new smartpens (including the discounted replacements). The OLED issue has alienated some Livescribe users, especially with the high price tags of the accessories and of the smartpen itself. Once the OLED display fails: Many cellphone cameras can see the IR light emitted when the pen is on so using the camera to look at the front of the pen and depressing the ink cartridge is one way of determining the operating status. Additionally, using the Volume Up/Down icons will cause a beep when the pen is on. Unfortunately, there is no way to determine if the pen is actually recording audio without the OLED indications thus rendering useless one of its primary functions. Livescribe offers free, fully warrantied replacements to customers who experience an issue with their OLED displays when their pen is in warranty. For US customers whose smartpens are out-of- warranty, the company offers replacement options that allow customers to purchase a fully warrantied replacement pen for a discounted price.

History In the 12th century, a fortress was located at Breda. The city of Breda came into existence near the fortress. In 1353, the Duke of Brabant sold Breda to Jan II of Polanen (Baron of Breda). He reinforced the castle with four towers and a channel. His daughter Johanna of Polanen married in 1403 the German count Engelbert I of Nassau. Their son Jan IV of Nassau enlarged the castle. Henry III of Nassau-Breda changed the castle into a Renaissance palace in 1536. He died in 1538 and his son Ren√© of Ch√¢lon finished the castle and built a chapel in 1540. Ren√© of Ch√¢lon died without any children and the castle became property of his German cousin, William I of Orange, during his battle with the Spanish, it had a military function again (Dutch revolt). In 1667 the Treaty of Breda was signed by England, France and the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. This ended the second English-Dutch war. Stadtholder - King William III of England built on the castle between 1686 and 1695. But he and his successors did not stay much at the castle. In the France time (18th century), the castle was a military barracks and military hospital. William I of the Netherlands placed at disposal of the Royal Military Academy in 1826. In this time, Thomas Vincidor built three wings and later William II built the fourth wing. The entrance gate is from the 16th century. Breda Congress Between 1746 and 1748 it was the site of the Breda Peace Talks between Britain and France during the War of the Austrian Succession. The talks formed the foundation for the eventual peace settlement at Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

It begins at State Route 103 in Kittery and runs north, terminating at State Route 9 in Berwick. Between Kittery and South Berwick, SR 236 is known as the Harold L. Dow Highway. The highway runs roughly parallel to the New Hampshire border (the Salmon Falls River) over its entire length. Route description The southern terminus of SR 236 is at the intersection of SR 103 (Whipple Road), Woodlawn Avenue, and Shapleigh Road in Kittery, near the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. It follows Shapleigh Road and Rogers Road to the Kittery Traffic Circle, where it connects to US 1, US 1 Bypass, and Old Post Road. The rotary marks the southern end of the Dow Highway. SR 236 has partial interchanges with US 1 Bypass and I-95, then continues northwest along the former right-of-way of the B&M; Railroad until intersecting SR 4 in South Berwick at the northern end of the Dow Highway. SR 236 is cosigned with SR 4 in downtown South Berwick, then splits off to follow Berwick Road into downtown Berwick along Allen Street to its northern terminus at SR 9 (School Street), approximately east of the New Hampshire state line. To the west, SR 9 crosses the Salmon Falls River into Somersworth, New Hampshire and continues west as NH 9 / NH 236. NH 236 (which terminates at the state border) is a westward extension of SR 236 through downtown Somersworth to NH 108 south of Rochester. Though it does not directly connect to SR 236 as signed, the two routes are connected by SR 9. History The northern section of SR 236, from Gould's Corner (near SR 103 and SR 101) in Eliot to downtown Berwick, was originally designated in 1929 as part of SR 103. That route was truncated to its current terminus in 1957, and its northern segment was re- designated as SR 236. Both SR 103 and SR 236 have a terminus at the other route. Most of the southern part of SR 236 between I-95 in Kittery and SR 91 in South Berwick was built in 1956 on the former right-of-way of the B&M; Railroad after service was discontinued and the tracks removed four years earlier. While railroad service has disappeared, SR 236 is a busy commuter corridor connecting to I-95, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and downtown Portsmouth.

When it is used in the film Lust, Caution, its \\"pathos and poignancy\\" is strengthened by the evidence of the Japanese occupation in the film's setting.

The Castle Mountain Internment Camp, located in Banff National Park, Alberta, was the largest internment facility in the Canadian Rockies, housing several hundred prisoners at any one time. Established on July 13, 1915, a total of 660 enemy aliens were interned at the facility during its entire operation.Bohdan Kordan, Enemy Aliens, Prisoners of War: Internment in Canada during the Great War(Montreal-Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2002), p.102 Internment Designated enemy aliens under Canada's War Measures Act, 1914, some 8,579 enemy aliens were interned during World War I as prisoners of war. Ostensibly nationals of countries at war with Canada, the vast majority however were settler immigrants, primarily of Ukrainian ethnic origin. The Castle Camp, which was built in 1915 at the base of Castle Mountain was a Canadian internment camp which held immigrant prisoners of Ukrainian, Austrian, Hungarian and German descent.Castle Mountain Internment Camp Despite their civilian status, a great many were sent to prisoner of war camps located in the Canadian hinterland, to be used as military conscript labour on government work projects.Bohdan Kordan, Enemy Aliens, Prisoners of War: Internment in Canada during the Great War(Montreal- Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2002), pp. 90-115 Of particular note was the use of forced labour in Canada's national parks, where they were introduced there as a matter of policy to improve existing facilities and increase accessibility by developing the park system's infrastructure.Bill Waiser, Park Prisoners: The Untold Story of Western Canada's National Parks, 1915-1946(Saskatoon-Calgary: Fifth House Publishers, 1995), pp. 11-12 By 1915 several internment camps in and around the Rocky Mountains were in full operation, including a camp at the foot of Castle Mountain, the terminal point of the then uncompleted Banff-Laggan (Lake Louise) road. Castle Mountain internment camp (1915)Recognizing the value of future tourism, the main purpose of the camp was to push the Banff highway on through to Lake Louise, although, in addition, bridges, culverts and fireguards were also built.Bill Waiser, Park Prisoners: The Untold Story of Western Canada's National Parks, 1915-1946(Saskatoon-Calgary: Fifth House Publishers, 1995), p. 14 The camp consisted of tents within a dual barbed wire enclosure. The tents however proved inadequate during the severe winter climate, forcing the camp to relocate to military barracks built on the outskirts of the town of Banff, adjacent to the Cave and Basin, site of the original Hot Springs. While in Banff, the internees were engaged in a number of special projects: land fill and drainage of the Recreation Grounds; clearing the Buffalo Paddocks; cutting trails; land reclamation for tennis courts, golf links, shooting ranges and ski jumps; rock-crushing; quarrying stone for the Banff Springs Hotel (still under construction) and smaller public works projects such as street and sidewalk repair.For a detailed description of the work regime, see Bohdan Kordan and Melnycky, Peter, eds., In the Shadow of the Rockies: Diary of the Castle Mountain Internment Camp, 1915-1917. Edmonton: CIUS Press, 1991 With the onset of spring, the camp returned once more to the Castle Mountain site. This process of return and relocation would continue until August 1917 when the camp was finally closed when the internees were conditionally released to industry to meet the growing labour shortage. The Castle Mountain camp was a difficult facility to administer. Abuse was widespread, and although duly noted by the Directorate of Internment Operations in Ottawa, never corrected.Bill Waiser, Park Prisoners: The Untold Story of Western Canada's National Parks, 1915-1946(Saskatoon-Calgary: Fifth House Publishers, 1995), pp. 19-21 Escapes were frequent. While conditions at the camp were roundly condemned by neutral observers and the Central Powers, charging Canada with violations of international norms governing the internment of enemy aliens.Bohdan Kordan, Enemy Aliens, Prisoners of War: Internment in Canada during the Great War(Montreal-Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2002), pp. 127-28 Understandably, the conditions at the camp would become of interest to the War Office in London and a point of discussion between the British Government and Ottawa. Legacy In 2008, a settlement was reached with the Ukrainian Canadian community on the matter of acknowledgement and redress for World War I internment. An important part of the settlement was funding for educational purposes. Parks Canada, the government agency responsible for national parks, is working with an understanding to create an interpretive centre at the Cave and Basin site that will highlight and underscore the nature and significance of the experience.See http://www.infoukes.com/newpathway/41-2008_Page-3-2.html Currently interpretive panels are on site. In 1995, a statue commissioned by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association (www.uccla.ca), memorializing the historical event, was erected close to the original Castle Mountain camp- site, near the foot of Castle Mountain off of Highway 1a. On 5 June 2012 the internment camp monument was visited by Sviatoslav, the Major Archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, who held a requiem service at the actual camp site to hallow the memory of those confined as \\"enemy aliens\\" during Canada's first national internment operations.

It was developed by the Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge by a team led by Professor Simon Baron-Cohen and including Dr Ofer Golan. The Transporters is based on the idea that children with autism may find human faces confusing, because they are unpredictable, because the autistic brain cannot cope with unpredictability. In Baron-Cohen's theory, children with autism are strong \\"systemisers\\" and faces are hard to systemize. In contrast, children with autism have a preference for predictable systems. The Transporters therefore focuses on mechanical vehicles that only travel along tracks, because they are highly predictable systems. Grafted onto these animated vehicles are real human faces. In this way, social skills teaching takes place in an autism friendly format.  Evaluation  A studyEnhancing Emotion Recognition in Children with Autism Spectrum Conditions: An Intervention Using Animated Vehicles with Real Emotional Faces published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders found that after watching the DVD for 15 minutes a day for four weeks most children with ASC (autistic spectrum condition) caught up with typically developing children in their ability to recognise emotions on four different tasks.  The series  The Transporters DVD release(s) consists of fifteen five-minute episodes, each featuring a key emotion. There are also thirty interactive quizzes and an accompanying booklet to reinforce learning. In 2007, the series was nominated for a BAFTA award. The series features eight animated toy vehicles. Each has an actual human face so that viewers learn to recognise real rather than cartoon expressions. All the expressions were verified by an independent panel before they were included in the series. There are two versions of the DVD, with different accents and vocabulary. The North American version is voiced by Kerry Shale and the British English version is voiced by Stephen Fry. The Transporters was originally commissioned by Culture Online, which was part of the UK government‚Äôs Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

Frew, and manufactured electronic equipment to order in North Melbourne, Australia. The name was derived from the words 'Technical' and 'Electronic'. After the second world war, Mr Frew manufactured a range of scientific equipment from his home in Brighton. In 1954, Techtron moved to small cottages in Market St. South Melbourne, and in 1957, won a tender to build electronics modules for Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometers (AAS) to CSIRO specifications. Mr Frew worked closely with Alan Walsh, the originator and developer of the atomic absorption method of chemical analysis. By 1962 Techtron had supplied about of these 40 kits, and took a manufacturing license from CSIRO to manufacture complete AAS instruments using imported Carl Zeiss AG monochromators, with electronics and other components made locally. In 1964 Techtron produced the first all- Australian AA instrument, the Techtron AA3, and presented it at the 1964 Pittsburgh Conference in the United States of America. In August 1965, Techtron Appliances Pty Ltd merged with Atomic Spectral Lamps Pty Ltd to form Techtron Pty Ltd 1967 ‚Äì Continued growth forced a move to Springvale Rd, Mulgrave, Australia. In October 1967, Techtron Pty Ltd merged with Varian Associates, an American company based at Palo Alto, California. This merger brought great strengths to Techtron in the way of manufacturing techniques, financial support, and perhaps most importantly, a worldwide distribution network for its products. The company now became known as Varian Techtron Pty. Limited. In 1970, Geoffrey Frew donated a substantial sum to the Australian Academy of Science 'in recognition of the successful commercial development of atomic absorption spectrochemical analysis, which had been originated by Dr A. Walsh of the CSIRO Division of Chemical Physics in 1954'. The Geoffrey Frew Fellowships enable distinguished scientists from abroad to travel to Australia to participate in the Australian Spectroscopy Conferences and to visit scientific centres around the country. Recipients have included Nobel Laureates A.L. Schawlow, G. Porter, G. Herzberg, C. Cohen-Tannoudji and J. Polanyi. In 1971 the company developed a range of UV-Visible spectrophotometers which complemented its range of AA instruments and allowed the company access into a new market segment. A totally new micro-computerised range of these UV-Visible instruments was given a worldwide release in the United States in March 1980 A major tribute was paid to Varian Techtron in 1982 with the decision by Varian Associates to transfer the complete Cary UV- Visible product line down to Australia. Cary had long been known as the 'Rolls-Royce' of UV-Visible spectrophotometers and now the total responsibility for the manufacture, marketing and future development of these products lay with the Australian company. In 1990 some 450 people were employed at the Melbourne plant. 1991 ‚Äì Varian, Inc. was formed to take over the scientific instruments, vacuum products and electronics manufacturing businesses of Varian Associates, Inc.

Common names include night- blooming cereus, barbed-wire cactus, sword-pear, dildo cactus, triangle cactus, and √ìrgano-alado de pitaya (Spanish). It was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Cactus tetragonus but was moved to the genus Acanthocereus in 1938 by Pieter Wagenaar Hummelinck. Description Acanthocereus tetragonus is a tall, columnar cactus that reaches a height of . Stems are dark green, have three to five angles, and are in diameter. Areoles are grey and separated by . Central areoles have one to two spines up to long, while radial areoles have six to eight spines up to in length. The flowers are in diameter with a tube in length. Outer tepals are greenish-white, inner tepals are pure white, and pistils are creamy white. Flowers are open from midnight until dawn, attracting hummingbird moths (Hemaris spp.). The shiny, red fruits are around long. This highly spiny, often large, and thicket- forming cactus has stems up to 10 feet or possibly taller. It is native to the coastal hammocks and hot, dry coastal habitats and thickets and sandy coastal habitats of central and southern Florida and the Keys, south into the Caribbean. The flowers are showy and are white with a deep red and orange or red-orange center. The flowers bloom at night and close during the day. This cactus blooms a few times a year for several weeks at a time. This cactus often forms thickets in coastal hammocks which can be impenetrable and spiny. Open bloom Fairy castles buds Uses Young stems of the barbed-wire cactus can be eaten as a vegetable either cooked or raw, while the fruits are edible and sweet. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental. It is sometimes planted as a living fence. The Fairy Castle Cactus, a miniature cultivar of this species, has many curved branches that resemble the turrets of a castle.  Invasiveness  The species is invasive in New Caledonia.

Christian use As used by Christians, it means \\"from Nazareth,\\" the town where Jesus Christ was said to have lived. The etymology of Nazareth from as early as Eusebius up until the 20th century has been said to derive from the Hebrew word ◊†◊¶◊® netser, meaning a \\"shoot\\" or \\"sprout\\", while the apocryphal Gospel of Phillip derives the name from Nazara meaning \\"truth\\".GosPh 56.12; 62.8, 15; 66.14. See J. Robinson (ed.), The Nag Hammadi Library in English, Harper & Row 1977, pp. 131-151. Nazario is an Italian and Spanish version of the name, Nazaire is a French version and Nazariy is a Ukrainian and Russian form. Other variants in use include Naz, Nasareo, Nasarrio, Nazaret, Nazarie, Nazaro, Nazarene, Nazerine and Nazor. Nazret, the Amharic word for Nazareth, is also occasionally used as a female name in Ethiopia and Eritrea, while Nazaret is also occasionally used as a name for girls in Spanish-speaking areas. According to the web site behindthename.com, all are derived from the name Nazarius, which was in use in late Roman times and was also the name of some early Christian saints and martyrs.Behind the NameCatholic Online In 2008, Nazar was the most popular name for boys born in Ukraine.http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-297589.html Arabic use Nazar is an Arabic name. There is no direct meaning for the name Nazar in Arabic but it is believed that it might be driven from the verb ((ŸÜŸéÿ≤Ÿéÿ±Ÿé)) -pronounced as- Nozer which can refer to different meaning as detailed in the Arabic dictionary such as (1) the little thing or reducing the amount of something; for example the verb Nozer can be used in a sentence to refer to the season with less rain, also to describe a quiet person who is talk just a little, or the female with fewest children (In the culture of the Arab world, the number of households believed to be >4) (2) the verb (Nozer) has the meaning of insisting in asking for something (repeatedly) such as for food, or a help, or for a favor etc., (3) the name Nazar has no link or reference in Islam (4) Some people(Non-Arabic-speaking) may mix between the name (Nazar) and the word Nadhar = ŸÜÿ∏ÿ± that means (eyesight/the ability to see) but in the Arabic language they are totally different words and they have totally different meaning. Therefore, the same pronunciation of the name (Nazar) could be found in the language of other non-Arabic-speaking population who through the influence of Islam adopted some Arabic words such as ŸÜÿ∏ÿ± = pronounced as (Nadhar) with its meaning (eyesight/the ability to see) which is not the same name Nazar in Arabic and it is clear that they can tell the difference as they do not speak Arabic.  Other use  It was explained above that there is confusion in non-Arabic speaking nations that have been influenced by Islam and still use some Arabic words. They mix up the words Nadhar/eyesight (see below; the evil eye stone which is from the verb seeing/Nadhar not the name Nazar) and the name Nazar. I am leaving the section below which it seems has been introduced mistakenly by a non-Arabic speaking editor so different readers can correct themselves or others from such confusion or mixing of these words. ( Nazar, or evil eye stone, is an amulet of stone or glass which is believed to protect against evil eye, widely used in Greece, Iran, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and other Turkic-speaking countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, therefore this name implies that the male named Nazar should be wise and handsome. ) People *Alejandro Nazar Garza (multiinstrumentalist) (4 September 1983... 20th century.

History In 1893, Howard Kelly, a gynecologist and pioneering urogynecologist, invented an air cystoscope which was simply a handheld, hollow tube with a glass partition.Kelly HA. Medical Gynecology. New York: Appleton, 1908. When the American Surgical Society, later the American College of Surgeons, met in Baltimore in 1900, a contest was held between Howard Kelly and Hugh Hampton Young, who is often considered the father of modern urology.Hugh H. Young Using his air cystoscope, Kelly inserted ureteral catheters in a female patient in just 3 minutes. Young equaled this time in a male patient.Young HH. A Surgeon's Autobiography. New York: Harcourt, 1940. So began the friendly competitive rivalry between gynecologists and urologists in the area of female urology and urogynecology. This friendly competition continued for decades. In modern times, the mutual interest of obstetricians, gynecologists, and urologists in pelvic floor problems in women has led to a more collaborative effort. Education and training Urogynecologists are medical professionals who have been to medical school and achieved their basic medical degree, followed by postgraduate training in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (OB-GYN). They then undertake further training in Urogynecology to achieve accreditation/board certification in this subspecialty. Training programme requirements and duration varies from country to country but usually tend to be around 2-3 years in most places. Urogynaecology fellowship programmes are available in some countries, but not all and the levels of formal accreditation and certification vary from country to country. The International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) is a global body for professionals practising in the field of urogynaecology and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery. IUGA facilitates training for physicians from countries which do not have formal training programmes by maintaining and publishing a directory of fellowship programmes. IUGA also provides educational opportunities for urogynecologists both online and in-person, develops terminology and standardization for the field. The International Continence Society (ICS) is another global organization which strives to improve the quality of life for people affected by urinary, bowel and pelvic floor disorders through education, and research. Scope of practice Urogynecology is a sub-specialty of Gynecology, and in some countries is also known as Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery. A urogynecologist manages clinical problems associated with dysfunction of the pelvic floor and bladder. Pelvic floor disorders affect the bladder, reproductive organs, and bowels. Common pelvic floor disorders include urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse and fecal incontinence. Increasingly, Urogynecologists are also responsible for the care of women who have experienced trauma to the perineum during childbirth. There is some crossover with the subspecialty of Female Urology - these doctors are urologists who undergo additional training to be able to manage female urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse and interstitial cystitis/PBS. In addition, there are colorectal surgeons who have a special interest in anal incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction related to rectal function. Contemporary urogynecological practice encourages multidisciplinary teams working in the care of patients, with collaborative input from urogynecologists, urologists, colorectal surgeons, elderly care physicians, and physiotherapists. This is especially important in the care of patients with complex problems, e.g. those who have undergone previous surgery or who have combined incontinence and prolapse, or combined urinary and bowel problems. Multidisciplinary team meetings are an important part of the management pathway of these women. Urogynaecologists manage women with urinary incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction. The clinical conditions that a urogynecologist may see include stress incontinence, overactive bladder, voiding difficulty, bladder pain, urethral pain, vaginal or uterine prolapse, obstructed defecation, anal incontinence, and perineal injury. They may also care for women with vesicovaginal or rectovaginal fistulae with specialist training, and in conjunction with other specialties. Patients will usually be assessed using a combination of history taking, examination (including pelvic examination and assessment of prolapse using validated systems such as the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System and assessment of quality of life impact using validated questionnaires, including the assessment of sexual function, using Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire IUGA- Revised [PISQ-IR]. A bladder diary is often used to quantify an individual‚Äôs fluid intake, and the number of voids per day and night, as well as the volume the bladder can hold on a day-to-day basis. Further investigations might include urodynamics or a cystoscopy. Treatment usually starts with conservative measures such as pelvic floor muscle training, fluid and food modification or bladder training. Drug therapies can be used for overactive bladder, which may include antimuscarinic drugs or beta 3 receptor agonists - both of these help to control the urgency that is the key component of overactive bladder. If medications fail, more invasive options such as injections of botulinum toxin into the bladder muscle, or neuromodulation are other options for symptom relief. Surgical treatments can be offered for stress incontinence and/or uterovaginal prolapse if pelvic floor muscle training is unsuccessful. Urogynecological problems are seldom life- threatening, but they do have a major impact on the quality of life of affected individuals. Urogynecologists will usually use quality of life improvement as a treatment goal, and there is a major focus on optimising symptoms using conservative measures before embarking on more invasive treatments. Some conditions treated in urogynecology practice include: *Cystocele *Enterocele *Female genital prolapse *Fecal incontinence *Urinary incontinence *Interstitial cystitis *Lichen planus *Lichen sclerosus *M√ºllerian agenesis *Overactive bladder *Painful intercourse *Pelvic organ prolapse *Rectocele *Rectovaginal fistula *Recurrent urinary tract infections *Urinary incontinence *Urinary retention *Vaginal agenesis *Vaginal septum *Vesicocutaneous fistula *Vesicouterine fistula *Vesicovaginal fistula *Voiding difficulties Diagnostic tests and procedures performed include: *Cystourethroscopy *Urodynamic testing *Ultrasound Specialty treatments available include: *Abdominal reconstruction *Behavioral modification *Biofeedback *Botulinum toxin injection *Dietary modification *Fascial grafts *Laparoscopic reconstruction *Medications *Pelvic floor re-education *Pessary (for prolapse and incontinence) *Pubovaginal slings *Relaxation techniques *Robotic reconstruction *Sacral nerve stimulation *Urethral injections *Urethral reconstruction *Urge suppression drills *Vaginal reconstruction See also *J.

Synopsis The series delivered seriocomic vignettes on rearing children, revolving around four generations of a middle-class California family, the Buckmans (the movie however, took place in St. Louis, Missouri). The Huffners of the film were renamed the Merricks on the TV series. The pilot episode was considered by USA Today and the New York Post as the best movie-to-TV spinoff since M*A*S*H.Bianculli, David. \\"One Big Happy Family,\\" New York Post, August 20, 1990.Collins, Monica. \\"\\"Parenthood,\\" Fun for Kids of All Ages,\\" USA Today, August 20, 1990. However, ratings for the series were low and Parenthood was canceled after 12 episodes. The series is notable for featuring a number of people who at the time were unheard of but later became famous.

It is a sequel to Boom Blox, and was released on 19 May 2009 in North America and in Europe on 29 May 2009. The game features more than 400 levels, and players are able to download new levels and upload their own custom- created levels to share online. Its development began after the completion of its predecessor, and it was formally announced on 28 January 2009. As with the original game, it was designed by film director Steven Spielberg. The gameplay of Boom Blox Bash Party resembles the original's, but features new mechanics. It has less emphasis on the shooting mode, which the developers commented was their least favorite mode of play in Boom Blox. It was created as part of a deal between Electronic Arts and Steven Spielberg to make three original properties, though it does not count as one of the three original properties. As of April 2012, EA has shut down the online servers, meaning players can no longer upload and download user created games. Gameplay An underwater scene Boom Blox Bash Party features similar gameplay to its predecessor. It features a new slingshot mechanic; the shooting mechanic is less prominent than in the first game. The game includes new environments (such as underwater and outer space), new block shapes (such as cylinders and ramps), and more extensive multiplayer. Boom Blox Bash Party originally allowed players to upload levels, as well as download levels made by other players and Electronic Arts. Uploaded levels had to be reviewed by Electronic Arts, with any inappropriate content filtered out. However, a player could download any levels made by someone on their Wii Friends list. Boom Blox Bash Party did not feature Friend Codes, a common method of online play in Wii and Nintendo DS games. Some of the levels uploaded by EA include levels from the original Boom Blox. The ability to upload and download levels ended on April 13, 2012 when EA shut down all of the servers. Development Bash Party's development was announced on 18 November 2008 by Variety. It was announced for a Spring 2009 release as Boom Blox Bash Party on January 28, 2009 by EA Casual. The game was developed by Electronic Arts and Steven Spielberg, just like its predecessor. It was a part of a 2005 deal between EA and Spielberg to make three original properties. It was conceived as soon as the original game was completed. Spielberg kept meeting with EA on Boom Blox on new ideas; producer Amir Rahimi commented that there was so much enthusiasm that \\"he could hardly stop them from doing a sequel.\\" A feature which was cut in Boom Blox was not included in this game either. It was a head-tracking system, which would allow the player to use two Wii Remotes to control the game's camera with his or her head. Because the developers didn't receive the development hardware in time to implement it, Wii MotionPlus compatibility is not included. In an interview, it was stated that Steven Spielberg had sometimes expressed interest in making a Boom Blox movie, but an Electronic Arts spokesperson commented that this is all just brainstorming. Reception Bash Party has received generally favorable reviews from critics, holding an 86% on Metacritic. IGN awarded Bash Party an Editors' Choice award, giving it 8.5 out of 10. G4's X-Play gave it 5 out of 5 stars.

He held the title of one of the fathers of the First Vatican Council. In addition, he was Grand Master of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. Biography Valerga was born in Loano. In 1836 he was ordained a priest. He studied at the Albenga Seminary and at Sapienza University of Rome. Prior to receiving his appointment at Jerusalem, Valerga had been part of Propaganda Fide and had also worked with the Chaldean Catholic Church, in what is today Iraq. In his efforts to reestablish the Latin Patriarchate, Valerga strove to make the Catholic faith the religion of the Palestinian villagers. While serving as Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, he was the last individual to have been dubbed as a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre by the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land 16 January 1848.http://oeuvres- saintsepulcre.fr/Presentation-de-l-Ordre He was subsequently appointed Grand Master of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre at its reconstitution by Pope Pius IX in 1868. Co-Cathedral Valerga envisioned the importance of providing a new church to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The Co-Cathedral of the Most Holy Name of Jesus was constructed and consecrated on February 11, 1872, the 25th anniversary of his Patriarchal consecration. The Co-Cathedral has continued to be the principal or ‚Äúmother‚Äù church of the Diocese of Jerusalem, and the church in which the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem has his official chair (cathedra).

She also appeared on the television version of the show that aired on Current TV. She formerly hosted The Point on the TYT Network and currently co-hosts a Jacobin YouTube show, Weekends with Ana Kasparian and Michael Brooks. Life Los Angeles-born Kasparian is the daughter of Armenian immigrant parents. Her great-grandparents on her father's side experienced first-hand the Armenian Genocide in 1915. She was raised in the Reseda neighborhood of Los Angeles.Kasparian says she grew up in Reseda at 2:00 mark of The Young Turks video \\"Mom Jailed For Putting Kids In Good School\\" (January 26, 2011) She grew up speaking Armenian as her first language and started kindergarten without being able to speak a word of English.Kasparian explains this at the 0:20 mark of The Young Turks video \\"People Don't Trust Foreign Accents ‚Äì Study\\" (October 28, 2010) She has said watching Sesame Street as a child is what helped her to learn English quickly. She danced ballet from the age of 3 to the age of 19 and performed ballet professionally throughout those years. Kasparian graduated from Valley Alternative Magnet High School of Van Nuys in 2004 and California State University, Northridge (CSUN) in 2007 with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism. She completed her Master of Political Science in 2010. In late 2015, Kasparian married Minor League Baseball player, model, and actor Christian Lopez. After having eloped, they had a public wedding in September 2016 which Cenk Uygur, fellow co-host of The Young Turks, officiated.Reza Gorhesi (2016-09-27) The Young Turks' Ana Kasparian Reveals on TYT That She's Secretly Married. The Empty Lighthouse Magazine. Journalism Kasparian said that seeing journalist Barbara Walters on 20/20 inspired her to get into journalism. After getting her Bachelor of Arts, Journalism (BAJ) at California State University, Northridge (CSUN) she became an assistant producer with CBS Radio news stations in Los Angeles, first with KFWB and then KNX.Kasparian describes her experience with KFWB and KNX from 1:20 to 3:20 in the TYT University video \\"Bad Internships for College Students & Graduates\\" from October 25, 2011. She said that she was lucky to be hired immediately after graduating, but did not like working for CBS Radio because mainstream media is \\"not fun\\" due to the \\"robotic work environment\\" where she could not say what she wanted on air or do stories that were important to her. She enrolled in a master's degree program as a \\"way out\\" of media. She has also worked with AOL News, YouTube, TidalTv and On Point. Ana Kasparian and Cenk Uygur hosting The Young Turks After becoming a fill-in host in April 2007, Kasparian became the producer and co-host with Cenk Uygur of the progressive talk radio on Sirius XM Satellite Radio and internet show/TV show The Young Turks. She was at first skeptical of her new work environment as an Armenian saying: \\"The Young Turks is a strange name,\\" but after working there the name was explained to her as: \\"it essentially means rebels. People who rebel against societal expectations.\\" She liked working at The Young Turks enough that she decided to stay in media. In fact, she was supposed to leave after two weeks but said she \\"kind of refused.\\" She was first hired on to do marketing but \\"weaseled\\" her way into doing on-air segments. Kasparian described what she liked about working at TYT: \\"What I loved about the show was that it was unscripted. It was raw. It was just completely unfiltered.\\" In a Forbes interview she also stated that she cannot pretend to be a \\"robot that's always neutral.\\" She needs to state her opinion and sometimes \\"aggressively so\\" and TYT allowed her to do that. She posits that young people are interested in news, but \\"they see network anchors as simply folks who read tele-prompters.\\" This is why she believes young people are attracted to online media because there are fewer tele- prompters and people are more genuine. Kasparian and her co-host Uygur applied a populist left branding strategy that made TYT a successful global online organisation, with larger numbers of YouTube subscribers than several other notable news networks like CNN. She co-hosted TYT University, a show focused on issues faced by university students that ran from March 15, 2011 to December 31, 2014, where she first hosted with Jayar Jackson and then John Iadarola. TYT University then turned into a show called \\"Think Tank\\" debuting on January 1, 2015 with different hosts and different topics but aimed at the same demographic. The show was hosted by John Iadarola and Hannah Cranston. She was the main host of another TYT Network show, The Point, which was a panel style show with a weekly round up of news stories. Common co-hosts on The Point included: political commentator Dave Rubin, science communicator Cara Santa Maria, American actor Hank Chen, and American football player Drew Carter. However, this show came to a close by releasing its last episode on January 5, 2016. She became a part-time journalist and op-ed writer at The Raw Story news outlet in May 2015. Kasparian appeared on \\"Take Part Live\\" several times in 2014, sometimes as a guest and sometimes as a co-host. She also is a weekly host on the Jacobin YouTube show Weekends with Ana Kasparian and Michael Brooks.https://jacobinmag.com/2020/04/weekends-with-ana-kasparian-and- michael-brookshttps://blubrry.com/jacobin/62042237/weekends-with-ana- kasparian-and-michael-brooks-june-6-2020-ft-tour-reed/ Michael Brooks died suddenly in July 2020. Academia Kasparian became a lecturer (i.e. instructor) at California State University, Northridge and began teaching journalism in August 2013. Views Kasparian has described herself as an atheist who pushes for progressive values. She wants criminal justice reform and has been a critic of private and for-profit prisons calling them \\"hideous institutions.\\" She has spoken out about campaign finance reform which is meant to get money out of politics. She gave a TEDx talk on this subject explaining a path that could be taken to achieve campaign finance reform in December 2016. She believes in free education for the United States and affordable housing. Her views on cultural appropriation as it applies to Halloween costumes have been controversial, although generally well received. During an appearance on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore in November 2015 she said, \\"people do stupid and offensive things all the time, and we can't expect to be shielded from it.\\" See also * History of the Armenian Americans in Los Angeles ReferencesExternal links TYT Network *Cary Osborne (3 February 2016).

Born into a military family, he enlisted as an artillery officer after finishing his schooling. Influenced by his experiences in the Russo-Turkish War and meetings with John of Kronstadt, he resigned from the military and became a clergyman. He retired in 1933 due to age and ill health. Four years later he was arrested and charged with monarchist propaganda. Sentenced to death by firing squad, he was executed on 11 December 1937 at the Butovo firing range.  Early life  Leonid Mikhailovich Chichagov was born on 9 June 1856 in St. Petersburg, Russia to artillery Colonel Mikhail Nikiforovich Chichagov and Maria Nikolaevna. He was born into a minor noble family from the Kostroma area with a strong military background. His great-grandfather participated in a study of the Arctic Ocean during the reign of Empress Catherine the Great, and his grandfather, Admiral Paul Chichagov, fought in defense of Russia during the French invasion of Russia. Leonid Chichagov was baptized on 20 October 1856 in the Church of St. Alexander Nevsky at the Mikhailovsky military school. Leonid Chichagov as an artillery officer, year unknown. Chichagov graduated with honors from the military academy and received the rank of lieutenant in 1875. He was assigned to the artillery and fought in the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878). He was awarded the Cross of St. George for courage displayed at the Siege of Plevna. He also received the Order of St. Anna and Order of St. Stanislaus. After the Russo-Turkish war ended in 1878, Chichagov returned to St. Petersburg. There he met John of Kronstadt, at the time a well-known and highly respected minister, who became his mentor. On 8 April 1879, he married Natalia Dokhturov, daughter of General Dmitry Dokhturov, with whom he had four daughters: Vera, Natalia, Leonida, and Yekaterina. As an officer, Chichagov received a number of foreign decorations. In recognition of his actions as an artillery specialist in maneuvers of French-allied Russian armies, he was awarded the Legion of Honour. He received additional military honors from various countries, including the Romanian Iron Cross, Bulgarian Order of St Alexander, and Montenegrin Order of Prince Danilo I, and was promoted to Stabskapit√§n in 1881. During his military service, he published his memoirs, –î–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–∏–∫ –ø—Ä–µ–±—ã–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ II –≤ –î—É–Ω–∞–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∞—Ä–º–∏–∏, reflecting his experiences with the artillery in various engagements. His war experiences had a profound impact on Chichagov. He studied graduate-level medicine to provide better care for wounded soldiers, and pioneered research on the idea of treating wounds using substances derived from plants. In addition to medicine, he also became interested in theology. Chichagov undertook independent theological studies during which he decided to resign from military service and devote his life to the Church. Though his wife did not initially accept his decision, she was eventually convinced after speaking at length with John of Kronstadt.  Priesthood  Chichagov tendered his resignation from the military on 15 April 1890 or 1891. He moved to Moscow with his family where he commenced his ecclesiastical studies. He was ordained a deacon on 26 February 1893 in the Church of the Twelve Apostles, a minor cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin. Two days later, he was ordained a priest. He began his pastoral work in the Church of the Twelve Apostles. He paid 15,000 rubles out of pocket to renovate the dilapidated church. He was awarded the right to wear the nabedrennik and skufia vestments in recognition of his work in restoring the church. His wife died after a serious illness in 1895.Some sources, however, claim that Natalia Chichagov died some three years later, e.g. –°–µ—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–º (–ß–∏—á–∞–≥–æ–≤) In 1896 he was appointed military chaplain for the artillery troops stationed in the Moscow garrison, for whom he ministered from the church of St. Nicholas. His personal contributions helped renovate the facility, which had been abandoned for 30 years. As a priest, Fr. Chichagov made several pilgrimages to Serafimo-Diveevsky Monastery and the Sarov monastery in Sarov. During these visits he wrote a history of the Sarov monastery and a biography of the monk Seraphim of Sarov based on interviews with nuns who had known the saint. This work would later contribute to the canonization of St. Seraphim in 1903. His extensive history of the Diveevsky monastery was published in 1896. Natalia Chichagov was buried at the Diveevsky monastery, alongside an empty grave intended for Fr. Chichagov. Following the death of his wife, he became a monk at the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius and received the monastic name Seraphim. He was later appointed Father Superior and Archimandrite of the Monastery of Saint Euthymius in Suzdal, and then of the New Jerusalem Monastery in Moscow. In 1905 he was appointed Bishop of Sukhumi. In subsequent years he was appointed Bishop of Orel (1906‚Äì1908), Chi≈üinƒÉu (1908‚Äì1912), Tver (1912‚Äì1917), and Warsaw (1918‚Äì1921). In 1928 he was appointed Metropolitan of Petrograd. Works Chichagov was also an iconographer: his most famous works are an icon of \\"The Saviour in a white tunic\\" and \\"St. Seraphim of Sarov‚Äôs Prayer on the stone\\". He also wrote the \\"Chronicles of St. Seraphim\\" about St Seraphim of Sarov.  Retirement and death  Seraphim (Chichagov), retired metropolitan of Leningrad, in Soviet prison Taganskoye, before being sentenced to death and shot. Metropolitan Seraphim retired in 1933 due to old age, ill health, and the threat of potential arrest. He celebrated his last Divine Liturgy on 24 October of that year in Leningrad, after which he travelled to Moscow. He stayed briefly at the residence of the Patriarch locum tenens, Metropolitan Sergius, before moving to an apartment. Seraphim's health deteriorated steadily after his retirement. He suffered from hypertonic dehydration and heart disease, and gradually lost all mobility. Despite his condition, he was charged with monarchist propaganda and arrested on 30 November 1937. Upon his arrest, the NKVD officers carried him from his home on a stretcher. He was imprisoned in Taganka Prison and sentenced to death by firing squad.

Early life Maynor was born Dorothy Leigh Mainor in 1910 in the town of Norfolk, Virginia to the Reverend John J. Mainor, a local African-American Methodist minister and his wife Alice (Jefferson) Mainor. Dorothy attended Hampton Institute where she studied under R. Nathaniel Dett. After her graduation from the Institute in 1933 she received a four-year scholarship to the Westminster Choir School in Princeton, New Jersey. Career In 1939, she performed at the Berkshire Festival where she was noticed by Sergei Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Impressed by her singing, he arranged her debut at The Town Hall in New York City on 9 December 1939. She received the Town Hall Endowment Series Award for 1940 as a result of this performance. In New York, she was taught by voice instructors William Clamroth and John Alan Haughton. Despite the fact that racism precluded her from performing in opera houses, Maynor toured extensively throughout the USA, Europe, and Latin America, performing in concert halls and frequently on the radio. She is noted as the first African American to sing at a presidential inauguration, performing at President Harry S. Truman's inaugural gala in 1949 and at President Dwight D. Eisenhower's 1953 presidential inauguration at Constitution Hall, where the Daughters of the American Revolution famously refused to let Marian Anderson sing in 1939. In 1964, she founded the Harlem School of the Arts which was designed to give music education at a reduced rate to the children of Harlem. Under Maynor's directorship the school grew from 20 students to 1,000 by the time of her retirement in 1979. She received honorary degrees from several universities including Westminster Choir College, Oberlin College, The Hartt School of Music (University of Hartford), and two degrees from Howard University. In 1975, she became the first African- American on the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Opera. She died on 19 February 1996 in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Personal life In 1942, she married Reverend Shelby Rooks, the pastor of Harlem's St. James Presbyterian Church where the Harlem School of the Arts was originally located. After her retirement from the School, Maynor moved to Kennett Square, Pennsylvania with her husband.

He went on to have a league career at Colchester United. Career=Charlton Athletic= Following the cessation of the Second World War, there was no League football in 1945‚Äì46. The FA Cup was the main competition to be played this season; to make up for the lack of quality matches, all FA Cup rounds from round one up to and including the quarter-finals were made two-legged ties (rather than the traditional single matches) with the aggregate score determining who went through to the next round. Poplar born Turner was a 22-year-old RAF officer who played part-time for Charlton Athletic, making a total of nine appearances in Charlton's run to the final, in which they played ten matches. After easy victories over Wolverhampton Wanderers, Preston North End (against whom Turner scored three goals in the two legs) and Brentford (another three goals), Charlton met Bolton Wanderers in the semi-final. Bolton were still suffering from the after-effects of the Burnden Park disaster in which 33 spectators were killed as a result of overcrowding. Charlton won the semi-final to set up a Cup Final against Derby County. Turner played no significant part in the final itself, whereas his (unrelated) namesake, Bert Turner, scored for both sides, conceding an own goal on 85 minutes, which he cancelled out from a free-kick a minute later. =Colchester United= In 1947, Turner was signed for Colchester United by manager Ted Fenton who was endeavouring to build a side capable of obtaining election from the Southern League into the Football League. Success took some time to arrive, and it was not until 1950 that Colchester (then managed by Jimmy Allen) finally achieved their dream, when they were one of two clubs elected to join an expanded Football League Third Division South. Turner scored Colchester's first Football League goal at Layer Road, when he struck five minutes into a 4‚Äì1 win against Swindon Town on 31 August 1950. Turner made 36 appearances in Colchester's inaugural Football League season, scoring twelve goals, but injury restricted him to only nine further appearances, and he retired from football in the summer of 1951, although he did subsequently return to the Southern League with Headington United.

While attending the University of Michigan, she won the NCAA event championship in the uneven bars three consecutive years from 1993‚Äì1995 and was a first-team All-American four times in the uneven bars, twice in the all-around, and once in the balance beam. In 1995, Wymer was named Big Ten Athlete of the Year. She was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 2006. Youth A native of Sylvania, Ohio, Wymer‚Äôs parents were both gymnasts, and they introduced her to the sport at age 5. In 1994, Wymer recalled: \\"My parents put me in gymnastics, actually. I had so much energy and was always bouncing around. I think I was kind of annoying. So they started me in gymnastics to burn off all that energy.\\" At age 8, she began to study gymnastics under Yusaku Hijioka at the Sunrise Gymnastics Academy in Toledo, Ohio. Wymer graduated from Southview High School in 1991 and was one of the most highly-recruited gymnasts in the United States. Wymer later described her high school regimen as follows: > \\"I would get out of high school at noon, and train. We had to write letters > to the superintendent and principal and convince them that this would be a > good thing for me. At that time I was elite and competing with the nation's > best.\\" Despite being an elite gymnast, Wymer did not make the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, finishing 26th at the 1988 U.S. nationals. By 1992, the 18-year-old Wymer decided to concentrate on a college career at the University of Michigan. In 1992, Wymer told the Detroit Free Press of her disappointment: > \\"I probably won't even watch gymnastics during the Olympics. I always wonder > how far I could have gotten if I had put 100 percent of my energy into > gymnastics. Maybe when I get older, I'll be able to watch.\\" Wymer recalled that her \\"mistake\\" was dividing her high school time between gymnastics, student government, cheerleading and boyfriends. \\"I wanted to be involved in everything, but I regret that,\\" she said. \\"I wish I had the mind and body I have today when I was younger. But I have to stop dwelling on the past or I'll drive myself nuts.\\" University of Michigan In 1992, the University of Michigan women's gymnastics teams was at a low point, having gone 0‚Äì13 in the conference in 1989 and 1‚Äì10 in 1988. Coach Bev Plocki‚Äôs conversion of the Michigan gymnastics program received a major boost when she succeeded in recruiting Wymer to Michigan. In recruiting Wymer, Plocki told her: \\"You can go to one of the three dominant schools (Utah, Georgia or Alabama) and be another All-America on their list of All-Americas. Or, you can come to Michigan and be the first All-America.\\" Wymer described her decision to attend Michigan as follows: > \\"I had always loved Michigan, had attended their gymnastics camps since I > was 13 years old. Michigan wasn't even on the map as far as gymnastics was > concerned. I was recruited by the No. 1 college team, Utah, very heavily. I > had some other big schools interested. I went on a recruiting trip at > Michigan. Coach Plocki said, 'you will be just one of many at other schools, > and here, you'll be the one that puts Michigan on the map. 'I thought, > that's a big challenge.'\\" Wymer won the Big Ten Conference individual all-around championship all four years at Michigan (1992‚Äì1995) and also helped Michigan win the Big Ten team championship all four years. Michigan‚Äôs women gymnastics team was 116‚Äì9 over her four years, and 45‚Äì1 in the Big Ten. The Wolverines finished ninth in the NCAA championships during Wyme‚Äôs sophomore year, fourth in her junior year and second in her senior year. She won the NCAA event championship in the uneven bars three consecutive years from 1993‚Äì1995, and was selected as a first-team All-American four times in the uneven bars, twice in the all-around, and once in the balance beam. Wymer broke U-M records for every individual event and received the first perfect 10 on the vault in school and conference history. In 1995, Wymer was named Big Ten Athlete of the Year. In her gymnastics career, she scored more than ten perfect 10.0‚Äôs on three out of the four events. Michigan‚Äôs coach, Bev Plocki said of Wymer, \\"She is the most intense person I have ever met. As an athlete, she obsesses with perfection. She has all the awards, but is still very much a team player. She's like a Baptist minister or something, the way she gets everyone fired up.\\" Wymer received her Bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1995 and a Master's Degree in kinesiology in 1996. Family and post-collegiate career Since January 2005, Wymer has been counseling clients in nutrition, lifestyle changes and personal training. Wymer has two daughters, Lindsay and Madison, and has also worked as a construction estimator. In 2006, she became the first woman gymnast to be inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. Wymer has also published an informational pocket nutritional book.

History=Adolf Sutro Era= In 1881, Adolf Sutro purchased of undeveloped land south of Point Lobos (San Francisco) and north of Ocean Beach at the western edge of the city. It included a promontory overlooking the Pacific, with scenic views of the Marin Headlands, Mount Tamalpais, and the Golden Gate. Sutro built his residence on a rocky ledge there, above the first Cliff House. The property had scenic views of the Pacific Ocean, Ocean Beach, Seal Rocks, the first and second Cliff House, Marin Headlands, Mount Tamalpais, and the Golden Gate. Features Sutro developed on his land holdings in the Lands End area include: * Sutro Heights Park, on the site of the former Sutro Heights estate of Adolph Sutro. He opened the extensive gardens to the public in 1885. They were a city park from 1938 to 1976, when the City of San Francisco transferred ownership of Sutro Heights to the National Park Service, to be managed as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.U.S. National Park Service, Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA): Sutro Heights History * Sutro's Aquarium (opened 1887), a concrete basin located in a cove just north of the Cliff House, fed fresh seawater by a high and long tunnel cut through an adjacent cliff. A heated, glass- enclosed pool was sited on higher ground above the tidal basin and featured a stocked supply of more exotic sea creatures. * Sutro Baths (1894-1964), a massive public bath house and freshwater swimming facility. It included six saltwater swimming tanks of varying sizes, shapes, and water temperatures, tiers of bleacher-like seats, providing seating for thousands of spectators, and a massive arched glass roof made from 100,000 square feet of stained glass and supported by 600 tons of iron girders.NPS‚àí GGNRA: Sutro Baths History * Cliff House (1896-1907), the second and elaborate Victorian chateau-style palace building.NPS‚àí GGNRA: Cliff House History * Sutro Pleasure Grounds at Merrie Way (1896-1898), a grand amusement park.NPS‚àí GGNRA: Sutro Pleasure Grounds at Merrie Way The Park and Ocean Railroad had provided relatively expensive transport to the Cliff House via Golden Gate Park. To provide inexpensive and more scenic transportation for visitors to the \\"Sutro District\\" features, in 1885 he invested significantly in The Cliff House and Ferries Railroad, a new passenger steam train line from downtown San Francisco via Point Lobos to the Sutro Heights area. =Post‚àíSutro Era= Adolph Sutro died in 1898. His daughter Emma Sutro Merritt then moved into the Sutro Heights estate. Until the early 1920s the gardens remained in relatively good condition with the plantings maintained in a state of maturity. In 1920, the ownership of Sutro Heights was transferred to the City of San Francisco under the condition that it be \\"forever held and maintained as a free public resort or park under the name of Sutro Heights.\\" Between 1920 and 1933 the Merritts continued to allow visitors access to Sutro Heights, but provided for minimal maintenance of the site. The second Cliff House burned to the ground in 1907. The third Cliff House was a lower Neoclassical style structure designed by Reid & Reid. It opened in 1909 and prospered until 1918, when the involvement of the United States in World War I required closure of all establishments within a half mile of Fort Miley Military Reservation to the north on Point Lobos (San Francisco). The Cliff House closed once more in 1925, not to reopen again until 1937. In 1933, at the request of Emma Sutro Merritt, the City of San Francisco agreed to assume maintenance of Sutro Heights but there was no major improvement or rehabilitation of the grounds. The garden's condition declined after maintenance responsibility was deeded to the City, and it accelerated after her death in 1938. In 1937, the city submitted a proposal to the Works Progress Administration (WPA) for the rehabilitation of the grounds at Sutro Heights. When Emma Sutro Merritt died in residence at Sutro Heights in 1938, the WPA was in the process of further stabilizing the western slopes with an elaborate series of artificial concrete cliffs. Following her death, the WPA proceeded to demolish the aging Sutro residence, then in a state of serious disrepair, and also the remains of the conservatory, entrance gates, and Dolce far Niente Balcony vista point. During World War II, Sutro Heights was closed for security reasons because of its proximity to Fort Miley Military Reservation. In 1949 the City of San Francisco commissioned a plan for the rehabilitation of the park. Little of the plan was implemented, except converting most of the planting beds to lawns. Between the late 1940s and the 1970s there was considerable vandalism and neglect at Sutro Heights Park. In 1951, battered still further by an even steeper drop in attendance at the Sutro Baths during World War II, Gustav Sutro offered the property for sale. George K. Whitney, owner of the Cliff House and nearby Playland at the Beach at Ocean Beach purchased it. He converted all of the swimming tanks to one large ice skating complex. Robert D. Fraser, a controversial developer, acquired the property in 1964 intending to build an apartment tower. In June 1966 a fire at Sutro Baths burned the once-grand structure to its foundations, and resulting sentiments impeded Fraser's development plan. =National Park Service= National Park Service management efforts since the City of San Francisco transferred ownership of Sutro Heights Park to it in 1977 are to identify and preserve the historic features remaining on the site. Concrete headers, planters, fountains, and statues were removed for storage and cataloging. Reproductions of the remaining statues, including the entrance gate lions, and the Stag and Diana, were cast and re-erected on the site. In 1976, the National Park Service acquired the ownership of the Sutro Baths site. The site is heavily visited by people who examine the remains of the baths and experience the feeling and setting of the site. In 1977, the National Park Service also acquired the ownership of the third Cliff House that was built in 1909. =Historic district= The National Park Service applied to have the area listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, under the proposed names Sutro Historic Landscape District and/or Adolph Sutro Historic District. The History and Significance of Adolph Sutro Historic District from the National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form (2000). The historic district listing was unsuccessful, but the Camera Obscura at the Cliff House was added to the National Register. Present day The Sutro Historic District, including Sutro Heights Park and the Sutro Baths site, continue to provide open space for strolling, exploring history, wildlife viewing, picnicking, and other recreation activities. The historic Cliff House and Camera Obscura are still visitor attractions.

This was after Taulava passed citizenship papers that should've allowed him to play in the league; earlier, he was indefinitely suspended from playing after his Filipino citizenship was nullified (only Filipinos are allowed to play in the Philippine Cup). The PBA Board of Governors refused to honor the court order, upholding Commissioner Noli Eala's suspension of Taulava after consultation with the league's legal counsel. Taulava's lawyer Ed Francisco charged Eala with giving the board wrong legal advice. Taulava did play at Game 1, in which Talk 'N Text won easily 89-71. As Taulava was being introduced, the pro- Ginebra crowd jeered him as the outnumbered Talk 'N Text crowd greeted him with cheers, displaying placards with a message \\"Welcome Back!\\" Eala himself had considered quitting his commissioner's post as he received a phone call \\"to make sure that Asi Taulava be allowed to play\\". After the game, Barangay Ginebra filed a protest to the commissioner's office. Talk 'N Text intends to play Taulava for the entire duration of the series. Barangay Ginebra reportedly indicated that the team may forfeit the Finals series if Taulava continues to be allowed to play and Game 1 won't be forfeited. The league has issued a motion for reconsideration on the court order, and Eala said that Talk 'N Text may face sanctions for violating league rules. In a board meeting on February 1, there was a \\"heated clash\\" between Eala and Talk 'N Text alternate representative Paul Gueco in which Gueco reportedly challenged Eala to make a decision on the Taulava case by himself and to tell Talk N Text what his decision was, a statement supported by board chairman Buddy Encarnado of the Sta. Lucia Realtors. Talk 'N Text did not field Taulava in Game 2 \\"in the interest of the Philippine Basketball Association and the public\\", even though Eala was filed of contempt charges, and Talk 'N Text's Game 1 win was forfeited against Ginebra. The Gin Kings won against Talk 'N Text by one point, thanks to Eric Menk's last basket with 5.2 seconds left to play. Ginebra's defense disallowed an attempt from the Phone Pals, leading to the 2-0 series lead. Francisco pointed out that new rules and regulations covering the eligibility of Filipino-foreign players such as Taulava, who was declared eligible by the PBA based on the Bureau of Immigration clearance and Department of Justice (DOJ) affirmation in 2001, cannot be subject to additional rules or conditions imposed retroactively and any such changes can only be applied prospectively. The DOJ, for its part, considered on intervening and seek a reversal of the court's ruling allowing the cager to play anew in the PBA despite the DOJ's findings that he is not a Filipino; although they won't intervene if the Court of Appeals would rule favorably on the justice department's petition seeking to lift an injunction against it issued by the Manila RTC on the separate issue of Taulava's deportation. DOJ Secretary Raul Gonzalez said that the rulings of the Quezon City and Manila RTC constitute \\"undue interference by the courts.\\" Para√±aque Congressman Eduardo Zialcita would seek a congressional inquiry into Eala's \\"continued defiance\\" on the court orders.

It is a rocky and windswept shoreline at the mouth of the Golden Gate, situated between the Sutro District and Lincoln Park and abutting Fort Miley Military Reservation. A memorial to USS San Francisco stands in the park. Numerous hiking trails follow the former railbeds of the Ferries and Cliff House Railway along the cliffs and also down to the shore. The most- traveled trail in Lands End is the Coastal Trail, a section of the California Coastal Trail that follows the railbed of the old Cliff House Railway. This trail is handicap-accessible until the Mile Rock Overlook, and bike accessible until the Eagles Point steps. A spur trail takes users to Mile Rock Point and Mile Rock Beach, which offer views of the Golden Gate. Additionally, Lands End contains the ruins of the Sutro Baths. Other historic sites include numerous shipwrecks, which are visible at low tides from the Coastal Trail and Mile Rock. A visitor center, Lands End Lookout, opened on April 28, 2012. History The Yelamu Ohlone tribe lived at Lands End before Spanish settlement began in 1776. After the Gold Rush, entrepreneurs designed the new Cliff House as a fashionable resort for the wealthy. A private company constructed a new road called Point Lobos Avenue. By the 1860s, a horse-drawn stagecoach made the trip every Sunday from crowded downtown San Francisco out to Lands End. During the 1880s, millionaire Adolph Sutro constructed a passenger steam train from downtown to Lands End for the affordable fare of 5¬¢. In 1891, an old miner called Charles Jackson announced that he had discovered a vein of bituminous coal under the cliffs at Baker Beach, on Sutro's land; Sutro had a tunnel dug 200 feet under the railroad track and confirmed the find, but the mine was never exploited and is hard to access today as a result of landslides.

However, according to Nehemiah 12:22 it is possible that a transcribing error has occurred in the rendering of Jaddua's father's name. A more likely translation is that Jaddua's father was Johanan. (Anchor Bible Dictionary). Reference to Jaddua may be found in Nehemiah verses 12:11,22. When reading Josephus' accounts of Jaddua's priestly position, it is unclear whether or not Jaddua was the sole high priest or if he shared the office with Manasseh. The other possibility (which is difficult to discern from Josephus' accounts) is that Manasseh was Jaddua's assistant or sagan. (Anchor Bible Dictionary). Jaddua's brother, Manasseh, married into the gubernatorial Samarian family. The governor's daughter, Nicaso, was given to Manasseh in marriageJosephus Antiq. 11:301-5 or 11:7:2 to try to ease the tensions that existed between the Samaritans and the Jews. This posed a problem for the Jewish elders as they did not want the high priesthood being tainted should Manasseh try to partner Jaddua as a priest.Josephus Antiq. 11:301-5 or 11:8:2 There are elders in Jerusalem who had the ability and authority to force Manasseh ‚Äúeither to divorce his wife or not to approach the altar.‚Äù (Vanderkam). In this dispute, Jaddua himself took the side of the elders of Jerusalem. Although the elders exercised authority, Jaddua was the top authority. In an account of the Jewish historian Josephus, it is speculated that the reason the elders opposed Manasseh's marriage was that they resented ‚Äúthe fact that the brother of the high priest Jaddua was sharing the high priesthood while married to a foreigner.‚Äù This marriage could possibly be the beginning of an office known as a sagan which later became the second highest priestly position. Because the high priest was the supreme civil and religious head of the Jewish people and the only competing authority would be the elders, Alexander naturally targeted Jaddua. Manasseh was not willing to \\"be deprived of his sacerdotal dignity on [Nicaso's] account.\\"Josephus Antiq. 11:309 or 11:8:2 Consequently, the Governor bribed Manasseh to keep Nicasco as his wife pending the permission of the Persian king Darius III. Meanwhile, Jaddua had a dream that he would be protected by God from the king AlexanderJosephus Antiq. 11:326-330 or 11:8:4 as Alexander was pursuing to conquer Jerusalem. Upon seeing Jaddua, Alexander relented his pursuit as he too had a dream seeing a figure who took the form of Jaddua.Josephus Antiq. 11:333-338 or 11:8:5 Alexander agreed to let Jaddua and the Jews keep the laws of their forefathers in return for military cooperation.Josephus Josephus included an account of Alexander reading the book of Daniel and believing that the prophecy regarding the destruction of the Achaemenid Empire was talking about him and his future conquests.

In 2011 he was awarded ‚ÄúThe Magician of The Year‚Äù by The Academy of Magician Arts. He graduated from Soochow University with a degree in Japanese literature. Lu Chen has made multiple appearances internationally, performing in Japan, South Korea, Europe, the United States, and Australia. His first public appearance in the mainland China was in 2009, during CCTV's annual Spring Festival, performing a close-range three-part magic show, which included \\"teleporting\\" an engagement ring into a real egg. Guests were invited to try basic magic after the show was over. He has been the recipient of many international awards, including the famed \\"Neil Foster/Bill Baird Award for Excellence in Manipulation\\", which is handed out yearly by the Chavez College of Magic. Early life and magical career Lu Chen first became interested in magic at the age of 7 when he was attracted by a magic shop while shopping with his aunt. He proceeded to enter and saw the shopkeeper make coins disappear, and when confronted, the shopkeeper pulled a lollipop from behind his ear. From then, he began working on his magic skills, and at the age of 12, he won Taiwan's Youth Magic Contest, which was judged by world-famous magician David Copperfield. In an interview, Lu Chen said that \\"This win was profoundly meaningful for me. It encouraged me to carry on my magic show dream. It showed me that my efforts could eventually lead to success.\\" Despite this, Lu Chen did not expect to become a professional magician, instead choosing to study the Japanese language at Soochow University, while practicing amateur magic in his spare time. His failure to find a job after graduation forced him to pursue a career in magic. In 2001, Lu Chen expanded his magic shows onto television, starting a show called \\"Magic Star\\", quickly becoming STAR Chinese Channel's's most popular show. In 2003, he took first place at the international World Magic Seminar. From 2007 to 2009, Lu Chen has been performing and judging on the magic segment of the Chang Fei's popular Taiwanese variety show, Variety Big Brother. His plans to pursue magic in China were fulfilled when he performed \\"Magic Hands\\" at CCTV New Year's Gala 2009 in front of a live audience and while one billion people watched the televised broadcast. His performance was the second most popular show that night, surpassed only by Zhao Benshan's skit. After his performance at the CCTV New Year's Gala, various provincial channels (most commonly Jiangsu TV, Shanghai Media Group and Hunan TV) offer an invitation for him to perform. He has also appeared in Chinese television commercials throughout 2009. He performed again the following year at CCTV New Year's Gala 2010 and CCTV Lantern Festival's Gala 2010. This accomplishment is considered one of his most remarkable achievements recently as he has shot to fame and popularity since then. After his debut in China, he mainly appears in China and Japan for his performances. In 2010, he was awarded the Merlin Award, his 26th magic award for his career. In 2011, Lu Chen became the first Asian magician to have his own stage performance at Las Vegas and the first Taiwanese magician to be published in the American MAGIC magazine. Today, many consider Lu Chen to be Asia's David Copperfield due to his high fame and popularity especially in Asia.

It is a frame rectangular structure built for the West Shore Railroad in the late 19th century. Passenger service ended in 1959. The station survives with the Highland Falls station as one of the few extant West Shore Railroad passenger stations. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2007 as the Milton Railroad Station. It has been used for tastings by a local winery, and a community group is renovating it to serve the Town of Marlborough as a community center. Description The station is located where Dock Road comes down from downtown Milton to the river's edge, in the midst of a small former industrial area. The Old Indian Trail Road leads to it from the south. A short, overgrown siding that once served the station and is considered a contributing resource to its NRHP listing is to the east. It is no longer connected to the still- active tracks between the station and the river. Disconnected freight siding The building is a one-story frame rectangular building with a broad gable tin roof and overhanging eaves. Its board-and-batten siding is painted red. The northern two-thirds of the building, the oldest part, sits on a sandstone foundation, while the southern portion rests on masonry piers. Inside most of the area was built for passenger operations. It has a waiting room with a fireplace and chimney, ticket office, two bathrooms and a cross hallway. The walls of the passenger area are decorated in beaded panelling and horizontal trim. Some of the railway's communications equipment remains in the attic, and freight scales remain in that area. =Aesthetics= In one of the gables was a hallmark of the station's architects, a bargeboard with the scroll-sawn word FREIGHT. Aesthetically, it reflects the Stick style common in the period of its construction, with its well-integrated forms and flamboyant detailing leaving the building's singular function apparent. The battens provide vertical scale and the window trim the horizontal. History The station site had been actively used for transportation purposes by local Native Americans long before the first [colonists arrived in the 17th century. Dock Road follows a ravine and stream down to the river, making it one of the few places where access to it from inland settlements was easy. When the future Town of Marlborough was settled around 1710, the station site was the boundary between its first two land grants, and some of the first houses were built nearby. A dock and related structures had been built by the end of the century. It continued to grow in the early half of the 19th century, becoming a regular steamboat port and the eastern end of the Farmer's Turnpike, which extended out to the foot of the Shawangunk Ridge in Gardiner, New York. A wheelbarrow factory at the site did a steady business. These interests resisted at first when the West Shore Railroad began acquiring property for their attempt to compete with the New York Central Railroad's (NYC) Water Level Route across the river. Their litigation was dismissed in 1882, and the station opened the next year. Postcard of station, circa 1913 The West Shore failed in its attempt to compete with NYC, and was absorbed into it after bankruptcy proceedings in 1885. The new owner expanded the station to its current size in order to handle freight shipments more efficiently. NYC eventually added a steam-boiler heating system. In the 1950s, airplane jet travel and the Interstate Highway System began offering alternatives to railroads, and the last passenger train stopped at Milton in 1959. A local winery bought the station and used it for tastings, putting in a steel stairway to the basement and removing the partitions that separated the station master and ticket agent's offices from the waiting room. In 1998, the winery sold the property to the town. The Friends of Milton Station began raising $100,000 to restore the station to its original appearance for use as a community center. The town has been seeking grant money from the state and other sources to cover the rest.

An application instantiates the session with the Session Description Protocol (SDP) over Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or other rendezvous methods. The MSRP protocol is defined in RFC 4975.RFC 4975, The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP), B. Campbell (Ed.), R. Mahy (Ed.), C. Jennings (Ed.), The Internet Society (September 2007) MSRP messages can also be transmitted by using intermediaries peers, by using the relay extensions defined in RFC 4976.RFC 4976, Relay Extensions for the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP), C. Jennings (Ed.), R. Mahy (Ed.), A. B. Roach (Ed.), The Internet Society (September 2007) MSRP is used in the RCS context, especially for the instant messaging, file transfer and photo sharing features. Protocol design MSRP has similar syntax as other IETF text based protocol such as SIP, HTTP and RTSP. Each message is either a request or a response, uses URIs, a message contains headers and a body that can carry any type of data, including binary information. Unlike SIP, MSRP is much simpler. The first 2 headers must be To-Path and From-Path and the last must be Content-Type, this significantly reduces the complexity of parsers. Messages must also end with 7 dash ('-') characters, followed by a transaction identifier which appears in the first line, these are followed by a continuation flag, which is a single character and end of line (CRLF). This last line at the end of messages makes it rather simple to find and detect the message boundaries. MSRP is not defined for connection-less protocols, such as UDP, thus one be certain that a response to a request would arrive on the same connection. MSRP also relies on a reliable transport layer, that is, guarantees delivery and maintains the order of the messages, which further simplifies the protocol design. An MSRP URI has a scheme (which is \\"msrp\\" or \\"msrps\\"), authority, as defined by RFC 3986, which holds the IP/domain name and possibly the port, an optional session identifier, the transport and additional optional parameters. For example: \`msrp://atlanta.example.com:7654/jshA7weztas;tcp\` * \`msrp\` is the scheme * \`atlanta.example.com:7654\` is the authority * \`jshA7weztas\` is the session identifier * \`tcp\` is the transport Usage in SIP MSRP can be used within a SIP session: * to do instant messaging in a one-to-one or one-to-many mode * to do an attachment file transfer * to do some photo sharing (e.g., Image Share) based on prior exchange of capabilities between the user endpoints MSRP session is set up through SIP's offer-answerRFC 3264, An Offer/Answer Model with the Session Description Protocol (SDP), IETF, The Internet Society (2002) model. The SDP m-line media type is message and the protocol is either TCP/MSRP for MSRP over TCP and TCP/TLS/MSRP for MSRP over secure TLS. Furthermore, the MSRP URI is specified in a path attribute. A full SDP example, as provided by the RFC: v=0 o=alice 2890844526 2890844527 IN IP4 alice.example.com s= - c=IN IP4 alice.example.com t=0 0 m=message 7394 TCP/MSRP * a=accept-types:text/plain a=path:msrp://alice.example.com:7394/2s93i9ek2a;tcp The address and port are contained in the c- and m-lines, but also in the path attribute on an a-line. Generally, other media types use the c-line and m-line to describe the address and port, but the MSRP RFC 4975 section 8.1 says the path attribute is the authoritative source for MSRP.

(died February 1, 1864, in Tomsk) was a Russian Orthodox starets. He was canonized as a righteous saint by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1984. There are many variations of a legend that claims that he was Alexander I of Russia who faked his death in 1825 to become a hermit. Historians reject the tales.See V.A. Fedorov in  Biography  There are no accounts of Feodor Kuzmich's early life. The first reported incident involving Kuzmich occurred on September 4, 1836 in Perm. His strange appearance alerted the local blacksmith who contact the authorities. He was described as tall, about 60 years old with lashes on his back. Kuzmich did not have any documents and the authorities subsequently arrested him. Following the arrest, Kuzmich was interrogated in which he claimed he was illiterate, Eastern Orthodox, and did not remember his infancy. The court ruled that due to his lack of documents he be lashed and sent to the Siberian city of Tomsk. During his travel to Tomsk, he was unusually not restrained by shackles.Kuzmich's house According to his life's history, Kuzmich lived a life of rigor, sleeping on a bare board and wearing only simple clothes. Due to Kuzmich's strange appearance and mannerism, residents assumed that his previous life was quite different from his present. Before and after his death many miracles were attributed to Kuzmich. When asked about his previous life, Kuzmich responded: \\"Why do you usually think that my situation is worse now than it was once before? At the present time I am free, independent, and, most importantly, - easy-going. Before, my peace and happiness depended on many conditions: it was necessary to take care of my loved ones enjoying the same happiness as I did, so that my friends would not deceive me ... Now there is nothing of this except what will always remain with me - except the words of my God, except for the love of the Savior and neighbor. Now I have no grief and disappointment, because I do not depend on anything earthly, nor on anything that is not in my power. You do not understand what happiness is in this freedom of the spirit, in this unearthly joy. If you would restore me to the former position and make me again the guardian of earthly wealth, perishable and now altogether unnecessary to me, then I would be an unhappy man. The more our body is pampered and groomed, the more our spirit becomes weaker. Every luxury relaxes our body and weakens our soul.\\" The death of Kuzmich Upon his death, Kuzmich's grave was visited by prominent people such as the Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich and Nicholas II. In 1984, Kuzmich was canonized as a saint by Patriarch Pimen I of the Russian Orthodox Church.  Rumors of a previous life  According to one account, he lived in a modest house with a garden; protected in a variety of ways by the Imperial Chancery, he received a visit from Tsarevich Alexander in 1837 and his grave was visited by Tsarevich Nicholas in 1893.Wac≈Çaw GƒÖsiovowski, viscount de Busancy, Tragic Russia (Cassell, 1908), pp. 120-25. Rumors of Alexander's tomb being empty have persisted since 1866. According to legend, Alexander's tomb has been opened four times, with the latest happening in 1921 when Soviet authorities allegedly opened his tomb in search of valuable metals. In each case it was reported that the tomb was empty or exhibited signs of tampering.Troubetzkoy 2002, pp. 205-210 It is suspected that Alexander I would have faked his death due to feelings of guilt about his father Paul I's death, and he faked his death to abdicate his throne and seek forgiveness for allowing his father to be killed. Prominent visitors include Innocent of Alaska, Father Peter Popov, and Bishop Athanasius of Irkutsk. In addition, Kuzmich is reported to have known French and spoke about life in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, as well as speaking about prominent people as if they were his friends. Kuzmich discussed in detail Metropolitan Philarate, as well as intimate details about the war of 1812. By this time, there were many rumors that Kuzmich was in fact Alexander I. On his deathbed, the priest reportedly asked him if he was in fact the Alexander the Blessed. In response, Kuzmich said, \\"Your works are wonderful, Lord ... There is no secret, which is not opened.\\"  Support for the legend  229x229px Among some of reasons supporting the belief that Alexander I faked his death are curious similarities between Alexander and Kuzmich. Svetlana Semyonova, president of Russian Graphological Society, analyzed both Alexander's and Kuzmich's handwriting and concluded that they are the same. Furthermore, there are rumors that Alexander's wife also faked her death a year after Alexander's death and became a nun in Saint Petersburg. Author Lev Tolstoy referred to the legend when he wrote: \\"After the monk's death these rumours only spread and became stronger. Not only common people believed them but many from the elite, including the royal family of Tsar Alexander III.The reasons for these rumours were the following: Alexander died unexpectedly, he did not suffer from any disease before, he died far away from home in a remote place of Taganrog, and when he was put in the coffin many who saw him, said that he changed a lot, this is why the coffin was quickly sealed. It was known that Alexander said and wrote that he wanted so much to leave his post and to stay away from this world.\\"  References  Further Reading  * Stone, Barry.

Synonyms  The name Starlicide originated as a registered trademark of the animal feed manufacturer Ralston- Purina in St. Louis, Missouri.Knittle, C.E.; Guarino, J.L.; Nelson, P.C.; Dehaven, R.W.; Twedt, D.J.: Baiting Blackbird and Starling Congregating Areas in Kentucky and Tennessee, Proc. of the 9th Vertebrate Pest Conference (1980), Lincoln, NE; p. 31, footnote Starlicide is a small molecule in which a central benzene ring is modified by amine, chloro and methyl substituents in a specific pattern. Because special names exist for benzene rings modified with one or two of these functional groups, several synonymous chemical names may be encountered: 3-chloro-4-methylaniline or 3-chloro-4-methylbenzenamine, 2-chloro-4-aminotoluene, or 3-chloro-p-toluidine. Numbered groups (2-chloro, 4-amino) also may be named out of order; the numbers of such groups equal the number of carbon atoms in the benzene ring separating them from the group implied in the special name. Preparations of this chemical may be named as a hydrochloride (e.g. \\"3-chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride\\", CPTH), indicating that hydrochloric acid has been used to neutralize the molecule to a salt in which the amine group is protonated and a chloride counterion is present; otherwise the free base is indicated. The chemical salt is also known as DRC-1339.  Use  Starlicide is lethal to starlings with an acute oral of 3.8 milligrams per kilogram body weight, but it is less toxic to most other birds. Grain-eating game birds such as bobwhite quail, pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and rooks (Corvus frugilegus) are also vulnerable. Hawks and mammals are resistant to the poison. Starlings are killed in a slow, \\"nonviolent\\" death by uremic poisoning and congestion of major organs. The effect is described as \\"a grayish white, frost-like material of uric acid overlaying the serosal surfaces of the various organs, accompanied by sterile inflammation and necrosis in the affected and adjacent tissues\\" akin to avian visceral gout. The site of action is believed to be in the kidney. Uses for CPTH include killing blackbirds on sprouting rice and on corn and soybean fields. For these and other uses the poison is often given with brown rice. Research continues to improve the effectiveness of delivery on brown rice by causing the poison to be retained on the bait longer and resist degradation by sunlight. The effect of the poison is believed to be cumulative: for example, the LC50 for starlings was 4.7 ppm over 30 days, but only 1.0 ppm when fed for 90 days. In 2009, a culling with starlicide received national attention after USDA employees dispensed the poison in Griggstown, New Jersey, to kill an estimated 5,000 starlings that plagued feed lots and dairies on local farms. When \\"it began raining birds\\", community members became alarmed, unsure whether a toxin or disease was at work. Two property owners in the area reported collecting more than 150 birds each from their land. In January 2011, there was another incident in Yankton, South Dakota, causing public alarm. The USDA had poisoned the birds in Nebraska to protect farmers‚Äô feeds. Ecological impacts Starlicide can and does kill nontarget species of birds that eat at feedlots and other places it is used. However, this rarely occurs because of the places that Starlicide is used. Rusty blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus), once an abundant species that is declining precipitously, have been theorized to be declining as a result of the use of Starlicide. However, this issue has been analyzed and found to be non-significant and not discussed by Avery (2013).Avery, Michael L. 2013. Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus), The Birds of North America Online (A. Poole, Ed.). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology; Retrieved from the Birds of North America Online: http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/200doi:10.2173/bna.200 Rusty blackbirds primarily feed on invertebrates in wet woodlands and near streams throughout the year. Even though they roost with other blackbirds, Rusty Blackbirds usually will not feed with them. Rusty blackbirds are a species not likely to be taken protecting crops because they mostly feed in wet woodland bottoms on acorns, pine seeds, fruits, and animal matter during winter, but sometimes will be found in feedlots (Avery 2013). Even at the highest potential nontarget take with Starlicide, few, if any, would be taken and not a cause a decline in their population. Habitat issues, possibly on their Canadian breeding habitat and on wintering grounds in the southeastern United States such as the decline of wetlands, is likely the primary reason for their decline.

The codes listed below are taken from the 1939 edition of the Telegraph Message Code bookGreat Western Railway (1939) Telegraph Message Code unless stated otherwise. History The Great Western Railway (GWR) pioneered telegraph communication over the from Paddington to on 9 April 1839 using the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph equipment. Although this early system fell into disuse after a few years, from 1850 a new contract with the Electric Telegraph Company saw double-needle telegraphs working at most stations on the line; these were replaced by single-needle machines from 1860. Although used primarily as a safety device to regulate the passage of trains, it was also used to pass messages between the staff. In order to do this quickly and accurately, a number of code words were used to replace complicated or regularly used phrases. The codes were changed from time to time to reflect current needs. By 1922 most railways in the country had agreed on standard code words, although the GWR had an extended list of codes that could only be used within its own network. In 1943 all railways were brought into a single system of codes and the GWR special codes were discontinued. Wagons Note: many of these codes could have an extra letter to identify variations, such as Mink A (a ventilated van), or Mink G (a ordinary van). Most of these codes were painted onto the wagons for easy identification.

Features A Roman gladiator commemorates the excavation of the Music Concourse in 1893. Three fountains line the center of the plaza with a fourth at the top of a staircase adjacent to the bowl. The plaza is planted with many trees laid out in a regular grid array. The trees, mostly London plane and Scotch elm, are heavily pollarded to give a very regular and formal appearance to the plaza. Numerous statuary dot the area, including representations of a Roman gladiator, Ulysses S. Grant, Ludwig van Beethoven, Giuseppe Verdi, and Jun√≠pero Serra. At the opposite end of the Music Concourse from the Bandshell is a monument dedicated to Francis Scott Key, though this was not its original location, having been moved to this spot in 1967. Several pedestrian tunnels lead from surrounding areas directly into the bowl.

A Turbomeca Palouste turbocompressor powered small thrusters at the tail and wingtips to provide a reaction control system during hover. The aircraft made its first hover on 16 November 1954. This was performed with the aircraft raised on a platform to avoid the reingestion of its exhaust gases. Wheeled landing gear - from a Cessna - was added to the aircraft, which went on to make horizontal flights in 1955. It proved able to make partial conversions at altitude, however it lacked sufficient engine thrust to complete the transition.

Going clockwise: Ginta and Babbo (top right); Alan (upper right corner); Jack (right); Dorothy (lower right corner); Belle on top of Edward (bottom); Snow (lower left corner); Nanashi (left, lower side); Alviss (upper left corner); and Phantom and Diana (top left). This is a list of characters in the M√ÑR series developed and designed by Nobuyuki Anzai. Team M√ÑR Team M√ÑR emblem =Ginta Toramizu= (ËôéÊ∞¥„ÇÆ„É≥„Çø Toramizu Ginta) Babbo („Éê„ÉÉ„Éú) Babbo is a unique √ÑRM that was first wielded by Phantom and is later wielded by Ginta. He resembles a metal kendama. He contained the soul of the previous Elder of Caldia. Babbo has many forms: * Babbo Version 1A: Hammer Arm - Babbo becomes a gauntlet over the user's hand with a metal ball at the end. The base of the gauntlet has the same design as the hammer part of Babbo's normal form. * Babbo Version 1B: Dagger Arm - Babbo becomes an extension for the first version where a dagger appears in the place of a metal ball. * Babbo Version 2: Bubble Launcher - Babbo turns into a gun that Ginta wields. This form can shoot exploding bubbles. Ginta uses this for long range attacks. * Babbo Version 3: Gargoyle - Babbo turns into a giant Gargoyle creature that levitates with a giant crystal as his lower waist and holds a ring in his mouth. He can use the ring to fire a strong beam that uses a lot of magical power. Because this version is a Guardian √ÑRM, Ginta can't move when he uses it, but it also is very dangerous...if he is reckless with it, Ginta's spirit energy will be crushed (he may also lose his sanity). * Babbo Version 4: Alice - Babbo turns into an angelic female Holy √ÑRM that uses healing magic, which is effective for counter-attack and protection against Darkness √ÑRMs. Babbo becomes embarrassed after the transformation. * Babbo Version 5: Cushion Jelly - Babbo turns into a giant jelly that protects Ginta and absorbs all physical attacks used by the enemy. This form will also render Ginta motionless. * Babbo Version 6: Puss in Boots - Babbo turns into a larger version of Puss in Boots where he gains immense speed, has a knife hidden in one of his boots, and the ability to use √ÑRM like Fresh Bonito (a Weapon √ÑRM that resembles a fish that is actually strong) and Mr. Replacer (a unique √ÑRM that resembles a doll that can substitute for Ginta when he is about to be attacked). * Babbo Version 7: Unification - Ginta used this form to get his father's mind back into his body. * Babbo Version 8: Reverse Gatekeeper Clown - Exclusive to the manga, Babbo turns into a form that resembles Gatekeeper Clown that allows a certain number of people to go through by the dice that it rolls. Ginta and his dad used it to go back to Earth following the defeat of Caldia's Orb. * Babbo Version 8: Omega Gargoyle - Exclusive to the anime, Babbo turns into a golden version of Gargoyle where it is strengthened by the hopes and dreams of everyone on M√ÑR-Heaven. =Princess Snow= („Çπ„Éé„Ç¶, Sunou) Snow was on the run from her step mother with her servant and good friend Edward. People were told by the queen to kill her. Much later they find an abandoned castle. As they explore it, Snow decided to seal herself away in ice. Edward tried to convince her to not seal herself, but Snow reminded him about the fact of the people after her and told him to run. Snow then told him to come back later with a Fire √ÑRM to free her when he is strong enough. When Edward returned with Ginta, Babbo, and Jack they met up with Dorothy then after saying farewell Dorothy told the Chess to come out and she killed them as a favor for Ginta. That's when Alviss and Bell arrive. When Ginta and friends arrive to Snow they see the enemies a man and a little girl. A fight starts with Ginta and the man. Later, Edward becomes Alan who then gives the Fire √ÑRM to Ginta telling him to save Snow while he continues the fight in his place. Behind a pillar is Alviss and Bell watching the fight. When Ginta melts Snow from the ice, Snow falls on and accidentally kisses Ginta, making it Ginta's and Snow's first kiss. This is when Snow first appeared on M√ÑR. Snow is the princess and only heir to Lestava and is the counterpart of Koyuki and Dorothy's step-niece. Lestava is the capital of M√ÑR Heaven. Snow has a VERY BIG crush on Ginta, so she is easily jealous of the times when Dorothy rubs on Ginta, kisses him all over the face, chases him, or jumps on him. Anytime Snow gets jealous, you can see giant flames cover her, so Edward usually panics right about now. You mainly see Snow wearing a pink ribbon, a pink with white jacket, a pink two strapped tanktop (that you don't see very often), deep red shorts, pink leg warmers, and pink tennis shoes. At first look Snow seems like a helpless 14-year-old princess, but her true self is an incredibly strong, loud, easily annoyed, scary, and completely strange girl. Due to her appearance many people misjudge her and go easy on her to find themselves beaten to a bloody pulp. Only her good friends seem to know of her true personality. Snow uses Ice √ÑRM to fight and protect. Towards the end of the series, Snow's feelings for Ginta become more evident. The plots in the final parts of the anime differ from the final plots of the manga: * In the manga following the War Games, Snow is connected with Koyuki due to their similarities as identical different individuals. From when Snow was little, she talked about a different world which Diana thought is a make-believe story. Though it's seem Snow generally forgotten about the different world while she grow up. Diana gave Alan a √ÑRM named Monban Pierro which summoned Danna. Diana then came to believe that the other world wasn't a myth and want to take over both worlds. When Snow used her √ÑRM, a 'hole' opened that connects both worlds. Even though the hole is still small with the power of both Snow and Koyuki, it's steadily getting bigger. Snow is released after Diana's death. Together with the rest of Team M√ÑR, witness Orb's defeat by Ginta. Ginta use the last ability of Babbo's magic stone to create Monban Pierro, returning with Danna to their world. In M√ÑR Omega, Snow is seen residing in her castle being guarded by Alan. * In then anime, Orb extracted part of Koyuki's soul as a fragment, downloaded the fragment into a special magic stone, and give it to Diana. Diana then planted the magic stone in Snow's mother and cast an ancient spell to melt that stone into a baby that's about to be born so that the baby born will be the identical in body and soul as the original. That's how Snow was made where she is an individual that's not supposed to exist in M√ÑR-Heaven, making a deep connection between Snow and Koyuki. Diana plans to use their connection to open a portal between both worlds. Following the War Games when Team M√ÑR stormed Lestava Castle, Magical Roe sacrifices his life to save Snow from the Death Cube. When the Ghost Chess came into view, she along with Team M√ÑR were captured. She and Team M√ÑR managed to escape with the help of Chaton and Loco. When King shows up in person using Danna's body as a host, Snow is killed alongside Nanashi. At the end of the anime, Snow and Koyuki became one being in order to give the magic stone that connected them to Ginta to defeat the Orb. Snow in Koyuki's body ended up staying in Ginta's world to be with him. Princess Snow's √ÑRM consist of: * Healing Angel - A pendant Holy √ÑRM that heals anyone in the vicinity of its glow. * Ice Ring - A ring Nature √ÑRM that would form an ice blade around the user's hand. * Iced Earth - A Nature √ÑRM that would fire shards of ice at the opponent. * Snowman - A snowman Guardian √ÑRM. It is nicknamed Yuki by Princess Snow. Snowman can also multiply. * Undine - A Guardian √ÑRM that summons a sentient being made of water that can create and shape water. She is voiced by Karen Strassman in English. =Jack= („Ç∏„É£„ÉÉ„ÇØ, Jakku) Jack is a young farmer who is the son of Jake and an unnamed woman. He is the one who meets Ginta early in his adventure and after the boy helps him beat the Rugelu Brothers, a pair of werewolves that were terrorizing Jack's home to claim the farm's vegetables. Afterwards, he and Ginta become best friends. Loud-mouthed and clumsy, Jack is the weakest of Team M√ÑR (though he is still on par with a knight), although not by any means the least resolute, if not the most: he never misses a chance on training to get stronger, first not to be a burden to others, and second, to avenge the death of his father Jake‚Äîa former soldier of the Cross Guard‚Äîwho died in the first War Game at the hand of one Zodiac Knight, Weasel. He also has a hopeless crush on every cute girl he can lay his eyes on, especially Snow and Dorothy, despite the fact that Dorothy treats quite cruelly. Eventually, his luck with females changes as he gains former Rook Pano as his girlfriend. In the end of the anime, Jack lives with his mom, Pano, and the two vegetarian werewolves that now work for him. In M√ÑR Omega, it was mentioned that Jack is engaged to Pano. Jack is based on the main protagonist of Jack and the Beanstalk, with his name, the fact that his mom is widowed and unnamed and his association with plants (including beanstalks) as similarities. Jack also closely resembles Monta from Eyeshield 21. Jack is a user of plant/Earth-type √ÑRMs: * Battle Shovel - Also called the Earth Scoop, it is a Weapon √ÑRM that resembles a shovel. At first, the Battle Shovel was weak. Later on, Dorothy helped to upgrade it with some magical stones. * Kikazoku Fire - A Guardian √ÑRM that resembles an Arabian midget with fiery hair that can perform fire attacks. * Mehitos - A Guardian √ÑRM that resembles a carnivorous plant. Like Snowman, Mehitos can multiply. =Dorothy= („Éâ„É≠„Ç∑„Éº, Doroshii, \\"Dorothy Gale\\") The beautiful 16-year-old Princess of Caldea who is also a witch of immeasurable power, and the younger sister of Diana: Queen of Chess Pieces (the former princess of Caldia). She is the step-aunt of Snow (although she and Snow have some trouble accepting this) and thus, she bears the responsibility to put a permanent rest to Diana's actions in accordance to the laws of their birthplace, the magic kingdom Caldea. She is first to appear walking up to Ginta. Since she saw the great strength of Ginta, she asked him to help her get √ÑRM. When he refused, she offered up a Weapon √ÑRM that was completely useless. Ginta agreed not knowing a thing about the √ÑRM, so they enter the cave of where the √ÑRM is sealed. Later, when they arrive at the √ÑRM's location they have to face a powerful Guardian √ÑRM, Brikkin. As Dorothy fights it with her Guardian √ÑRM Flying Leo, Ginta gets the √ÑRM who calls himself Babbo, then Flying Leo breaks, and so with Babbo he beats the Guardian Brikkin. Later they argue over Babbo to the point when Dorothy tried and failed to pick up Babbo because it was too heavy thus Ginta got Babbo. Disappointed she flew away on the Nature √ÑRM Zephiroth's Broom. Dorothy has an interest in stealing any uncommon √ÑRMs she comes across (which is also her other duty on Kaldea's behalf), heaping up into a wide variety for her collection, but she seems to prefer Guardian √ÑRMs and Wind-themed √ÑRMs in battle. Dorothy's moods can vary from the sweet, kind-hearted girl to the pitiless, cruel fighter who could kill her enemies without any second thought. She also has a notably large crush on Ginta, leading her to smother him with attention, much to Princess Snow's dismay. During the last Chess battle with the Chess Pieces, when she was against Chimera, part of her dress were ripped away to expose a majority of her left breast (but not enough to expose her nudity), while a portion of the dress at her right hip was exposed too. Many viewers also commented on the 'intentional' attention on her breasts, when her breasts shake when Dorothy was surprised at Chimaera's Ghost √ÑRM, a close up at her breasts at a view slightly behind Dorothy, and when Ugly Hag was touching her breast while she was struggling against a pair of Ogre Hands. There is also a joke-skill that Dorothy has, called mostly 'Defy Gravity', made out when Chimera takes Dorothy's leg and turns her upside down, but her dress does not slip down to reveal a likely genital (since it was speculated that with no brassiere, there will be no undergarments). This fact is also supported as the story never shows undergarments, as when Pinocchio uses his multiple hands to grab both of Dorothy's legs and spreads them, while pulling her towards a chainsaw to cut her into half from between the legs, only her lap and thigh can be seen, with a slip of the dress between her legs. Dorothy is inspired from the Wizard Of OZ from her name being the same as the main character except instead of defeating a witch she is one. She also has allusions to it from her √ÑRM including: Scarecrow who is pretty dumb like the scarecrow from the original was supposed be, Rain Dog which is named TOTO like Dorothy's from the wizard of Oz, Flying Leo a combination of the cowardly lion and the flying monkeys & Ring Armor which looks the tin man. And Like her counterpart she also has to kill a witch although in this case it's her sister and not the wicked witch of the west. Dorothy's √ÑRM consists of: * Andarta - A Dimension √ÑRM that allows Dorothy to teleport to anywhere that she has been. * Antidote Tonic - A Holy √ÑRM used to cure poisons. * Broom of Zephyrus - A Nature √ÑRM that takes the form of a metal broom that is always seen near Dorothy. Besides using it as her mode of transportation, Dorothy can shape the wind with it. * Crazy Quilt - A Guardian √ÑRM that takes the form of a loud- mouthed whimsical puppet with dirty clothes and no legs. * Flying Leo - A Guardian √ÑRM that summons a flying lion. * Ring Armor - A common Guardian √ÑRM that summons a living suit of armor that is often used to test an enemy's strength. * Ring Dagger - A Weapon √ÑRM that Dorothy uses when she doesn't want to use up her Broom of Zephyrus. * Rock Giant Golem - A Guardian √ÑRM that resembles a giant suit of rock armor. It originally guarded Babbo until it was defeated and ended up in Dorothy's possession. * Scarecrow - A Guardian √ÑRM that takes the form of a scarecrow whose hat can turn into a drill. * Toto - A Guardian √ÑRM that is the name of a Rain Dog (a three-tailed dog) that can eat absolutely anything. * Watching Bird - A Dimension √ÑRM that takes the form of a purple hummingbird that can watch anything and send the hologram of what it sees back to the user where it is shown on the ground. * Zipper - A Dimensional √ÑRM that summons a zipper that Dorothy uses to store her extra √ÑRM. =Alan= („Ç¢„É©„É≥, Aran) A hardened (smoking) warrior, the powerful human who participated in the previous M√ÑR-Heaven War against the Chess Piece, known as the 2nd man, Danna's partner in the Cross Guard. His power level is said to be equivalent to a Knight in the method of power ranking used by the Chess Pieces, and once fought to a draw with the Knight's third in command, the one ranked directly under the No.1 Knight Phantom, Halloween. It is later found out that he and Halloween were once childhood friends, back when the latter's name was Pump. However, because of a curse set by Halloween's Darkness √ÑRM Igneil in the same fight, Alan was sealed inside the court guardian and custodian dog of princess Snow, Edward. In order to change back into Alan, Ed has to sleep three times, often forcibly knocking himself out, which is too risky and inconvenient for most situations. If Alan sleeps once, he becomes Ed again. After the visit from Phantom and his Zodiac Knights, Alan and Ed are split apart into two beings by Ginta, using Babbo's Alice transformation. Due to his time inside Edward, Alan has developed a fear of cats. In the end of the anime, Alan lives with Chaton, Babbo, and the baby Loco. Alan's √ÑRM consists of: * Air Hammer - A set of rings and bangles Dimension √ÑRM and Alan's most frequently used weapon. It uses an attack called \\"Air Freeze\\" that creates blasts of air shaped into concussive blasts and compensates for Alan's lack of ranged attacks. * Bumoru - A Guardian √ÑRM in the form of a rude, fat woman with a bear tail and ears, used to help people the Training Gate train, and to navigate for them. She's referred to as 'the ugly one.' * Flame Dragon - A flame Nature √ÑRM, this is the natural counter to Snow's √ÑRM and is able to conjure fire in any form. This is what he uses to light his cigars. * Merilo - A pendant Guardian √ÑRM in the form of a polite, slender girl with a cat tail and ears, used to help people the Training Gate train, and to navigate for them. She's referred to as 'the cute one'. Although she does have cat attributes, Alan isn't allergic to her because she is an √ÑRM. * Saint Anger - A Guardian √ÑRM. Incarnating Alan's fists of justice and expanding an even wider reach, these armour hands that descend from heaven thunder earth with its deliverance of god's punishment to all sinners. * Shadowman - A Nature √ÑRM that can create a being out of a persons shadow, this copy has the same magical powers and skills as the person on what it is based. * Training Gate - A Dimension √ÑRM that Alan used to train Ginta, Snow, Jack. and Dorothy. It puts people at the user's will inside this gate, where time slows to 1/60th of its outside time and with many challenges programmed within it, the dimension serves good training ground. The drawback to using this √ÑRM is that Alan cannot go inside the Gate himself and he cannot move while he uses it. =Alviss= („Ç¢„É´„É¥„Ç£„Çπ, Aruvisu, \\"Alv√≠ss\\") The cold figure of M√ÑR, Alviss is the one who brought Ginta into M√ÑR-Heaven. He joined the Cross Guard in the 1st War Game and grew fond of their leader, Danna, with whom he shared the very same goal for which they put their lives at risk, to fight the Chess and protect M√ÑR-Heaven. This pure courage, however, got Alviss further than he could ever have expected even in his wildest dream: Phantom also chose him as one who would reside in the dreary future of M√ÑR-Heaven, in the form of a Zombie-tattooed undead. Alviss, not wanting to live as an immortal, makes it his life's goal to defeat Phantom. A superior in the Cross Guard, Gaira, recognizes this and trains Alviss. When Alviss finally succeeds in defeating Gaira in a wooden sword fight, Alviss is rewarded with two √ÑRM: Gate Keeper Clown, and 13 Totem Pole. While training, Alviss also befriends the fairy Belle. From then on Belle is almost always seen in Alviss' company outside of battles. For years Alviss lives under the looming shadow of this most unwanted tomorrow, and recluses from opening his heart for others. However, after meeting with Ginta, Alviss starts to change and finally stands up facing destiny in full height. Alviss is first introduced sending Ginta Toramizu to M√ÑR-Heaven. Alviss then searches for the one brought to M√ÑR Heaven, only to find out that it's a child with no magical power. Alviss then turns Jack into a bird and tells Ginta he will destroy Babbo, which angers Ginta. Ginta immediately fights Alviss, however, Ginta stands no chance and quickly loses. Alviss, however, releases Jack and doesn't kill Babbo. Alviss follows Ginta and his allies around until they reach the War Games, where Alviss enters as a member of the Cross Guard. Alviss is the only member of the Cross Guard that made it past the preliminaries. During the War Games, Alviss forms a rivalry of sorts with Rolan of the Chess Pieces, and the two battle twice: once in the 3rd round, where Alviss loses, and again in the final round, where Alviss emerges as the victor. Part of their rivalry is due, in part, to both of them owning a Zombie Tattoo, though, unlike Alviss, Rolan is happy to have received one. In the anime, following the War Games, Alviss' Zombie Tattoo is awakened by the Ghost Chess, bringing Alviss under Phantom's control. After confronting former allies in Team M√ÑR, Alviss manages to resist the Zombie Tattoo and leave Phantom. Alviss later returns, however, to destroy Phantom. Rolan confronts Alviss, attempting to stop him, but, realizing Phantom will leave this world soon, attempts suicide, though, unknown to Alviss, Rolan survives. Phantom then appears before Alviss and willingly allows Alviss to kill him. When Alviss finds himself unable to, Phantom uses Alviss' weapon to perform the death strike on himself, freeing Alviss from the Zombie Tattoo. After Phantom's death, Alviss, along with the rest of Team M√ÑR, are confronted by the Chess Pieces' King. Like most of the other members, Alviss dies fighting King. Once King is defeated by Ginta, however, Alviss is brought back to life. At the end of both the manga and anime, Alviss and Belle live together. Alviss' √ÑRM consists of: * 13 Totem Pole - Guardian Mode - Alviss's main attacking √ÑRM, a chain Guardian/Weapon √ÑRM. Guardian mode causes many giant totem poles to erupt from underground. They can also separate to fire individual sections at the opponent.  13 Totem Pole: Rod Mode - Alviss's main attacking √ÑRM, a chain Guardian/Weapon √ÑRM. Its Rod Mode is a Weapon √ÑRM staff made of 13 sections of the totem pole. Given to Alviss by Gaira. * √Å Bao A Qu - Though the name is a direct reference to the mystical monster of Malaysian legend, the summoned form of this bracelet Guardian √ÑRM is thoroughly inspired by the renown space fortress of Mobile Suit Gundam. Once arisen, its asteroid \\"jaw\\" and \\"checkbone\\" will cleave, opening the √Å Bao A Qu's \\"eye\\". Its gaze will then take in the sights of foes and jail them in a glass ball, detonating from within. * Caged Bird - A Darkness √ÑRM that traps someone inside a cage and turns that person into a bird. * Gatekeeper Clown - The Dimension √ÑRM that brought people from other worlds to M√ÑR-Heaven, broke after fulfilling its purpose. It has also been stated during its first appearance it determines the number of people who can come though by the roll of a dice. But it's already broken when Alviss summon Ginta to M√ÑR Heaven * Guardiss - A ring Weapon √ÑRM that creates a large shield with a cross on it. * Purific Ave - The Holy √ÑRM Alviss ever had which was given to him by Ginta. The Purific Ave is the only √ÑRM that is capable of killing Phantom. * Sealing Skull - A Darkness √ÑRM, causes the target to become paralyzed while seeing images of frightening skeletal phantoms. As its \\"price\\" for use, it causes the user excruciating pain. =Nanashi= („Éä„Éä„Ç∑, Nanashi) Nanashi was found by Galian in the middle of nowhere, lying alone and nearly dead due to a nasty wound in his stomach. After he was revived by him and taken to the bandit Guild of Luberia, it turned out he had no memory of his past or even his name, and thus Galian named him Nanashi (nameless). Galian would later betray Nanashi, joining the Chess Pieces and leaving him in charge of Luberia after erasing his memory of him. Nanashi's main goal is to track down the Chess Piece responsible for wiping out Luberia (Peta) and avenge his slain allies. Though through all his seriousness in killing Peta and avenging his comrades, Nanashi still has time for flirting. It's also implied that Nanashi is from Earth, because Babbo says he has the same scent as Ginta, his unusual strength while fighting Oruko and his knowledge in how to make takoyaki which does not exist in M√ÑR. Nanashi's √ÑRM consists of: * Aegis - An aspis etched with the carving of a white maiden, this Holy √ÑRM lives up to its title of \\"god's shield\\", with the ability to most effectively guard its user from physical assaults, and refuel him with magic power. * Andata - A Dimension √ÑRM that transports Nanashi and all he wishes to any place that he has already been to, stored in its memory. * Crystal Balls - A Dimension √ÑRM. This √ÑRM can show in real time events occurring in any place Nanashi wishes. * Electric Eye - A ring Nature √ÑRM which produces bolts of lightning that Nanashi fires at his enemies. Everytime Nanashi uses this √ÑRM, he sees a shadowy outline of Galian. * Griffin Lance - A ring Weapon √ÑRM that takes the form of a lance with griffin-headed tip. * Gymnote - A Guardian √ÑRM. Passing from inside Caldia's vault into Nanashi's possession, summons a giant, pink, eyeless electric eel to crush and or electrocute Nanashi's enemies. * Thousand Needles - Weapon √ÑRM, a necklace that creates giant spikes from the ground to attack the user's enemies. NOTE: It is heavily implied that Nanashi is Joker from Nobuyuki Anzai's previous manga Flame of Recca because of his appearance somewhat matching Joker's (during the SODOM story arc) and the wound to his stomach (because Joker was impaled in his stomach before he created a black hole which sucked him in) possibly leading to M√ÑR. Joker is never seen again after he was sucked in the black hole. This has not been officially confirmed by Nobuyuki Anzai. Chess Pieces is a fictional organization in the manga and anime series and plays the role of the main antagonist faction. It is a military faction which, over the 10 years it was in existence, has established supremacy over the rest of its rebellious kind in M√ÑR-Heaven; its notoriety for being the predominantly antagonist organization enjoys a prestige of such the name of Chess Pieces has become a taboo for generations to come. This organization's home to people from a m√©lange of backgrounds with a m√©lange of motives: discarded humans seeking a refuge, victims of social injustice wishing to avenge themselves upon their antagonists, radicals aiming to 'cleanse' the current M√ÑR-Heaven, or simply lusters of wealth, power, women, √ÑRMs or war; all united under the same goal: to conquer the world. The Chess ranks are based on the pieces in the game of chess with rank going from king down to queen, knights, bishops, rooks, and pawns, separating the hierarchy into two parts. Its top is governed by the command force of one King and one Queen, which lurks in darkness most of the time the identity of its two members privy almost to none outside the Chess Pieces; headed by the Queen Diana. Second to it is the combat force consisted of echeloned Knights (elite fighters, leading operation executors), Bishops, Rooks and Pawns (foot soldiers); headed by the no.1 Knight Phantom. Chess members from Rook ranks upward is permitted the possession of class earrings (which are actually Dimension √ÑRMs that allow them to communicate with other Chess Pieces,\\"M√ÑR\\" manga volume 4, chapter 38, page 14 like the Cross Guard's are) and individual masks. Although the rudimentary rule for ranking one is based on their power (proved by mastery of ARMs or in less usual cases, impressive feats), it's also noted that soldiers of lower ranks can be stronger than their superiors.\\"M√ÑR\\" manga volume 6, chapter 58, page 7 =Members=King („Ç≠„É≥„Ç∞, Kingu) Top class of the Chess Pieces, accessible to Queen class only. =Caldia's Orb= Caldia's Orb is an orb formed in Caldia, the island of magic users, to contain the most evil of evils, and thus was locked away in Caldia's floating palace. After influencing both Phantom and Diana with its thoughts, Caldia's Orb was freed by the two, and the three together formed the Chess Pieces with the Orb as King. The Orb entered Babbo for Phantom to use as a weapon, and after Phantom's death possessed Danna's body as a new host with which to control the Chess Pieces. While awaiting Phantom's revival, the Orb concocted a plan to conquer both M√ÑR-Heaven and Earth alongside his Queen. Caldia's Orb's only thoughts are those of pure malevolence, though, he hates the human race for such sins as well. The true form of the evil that is the Orb is an eyeless corpse wielding a scythe, a perfect form for something of such impurity. The anime shows the Orb having other abilities, such as strangling enemies without touching them in a manner similar to The Force from Star Wars, and immediately killing those who touch its deadly aura. The Orb, following the defeat of Phantom, decided that all of the Chess Piece soldiers, outside of itself and Diana, were useless pawns and massacred all of them, the only survivors being those who already abandoned the Chess. The next step to total victory the Orb devised was the annihilation of Team M√ÑR, killing all of its members outside Ginta and Jack. Following Diana's defeat, the Orb challenged Ginta and revealed its form of Danna. Though at first discouraged to fight his father's body, Ginta eventually managed to use Babbo to draw the Orb out of his father and put Danna's soul back in its rightful place. In the manga, the Orb then entered Babbo and battled Ginta, who entered Babbo as well, and was defeated right there, its remains a magic stone for Babbo. In the anime, the Orb escapes to Earth and begins wreaking havoc. Eventually, Ginta returns to Earth and, using the collective willpower of his friends (include the dead comrades) in M√ÑR-Heaven, summoned a golden Gargoyle to ultimately destroy the Orb. In both versions the Orb's final words were to warn humanity that one day all life will be destroyed by their own hands. The √ÑRMs of Caldia's Orb consists of: * Explode - A Nature √ÑRM that takes the form of a semi-circular glass ball that encloses its prey and explodes. * Gigant Blade - A giant sword Weapon √ÑRM with its handle run into the spine of its heavily spiked blade. * Phoenix - From within the sacred flame of its cyclical rebirth, this Guardian is summoned to fight by the King's side and consume all his opponents in flame. * Raijin Goyles - A Nature √ÑRM that takes the form of two gyrating wheels of air that King launches at his opponents. * Tiamat - Answering King's behest, the fallen mother goddess with her retained mythological appearance emerges from legend to bring retributions upon all those who rebel him. Queen („ÇØ„Ç§„Éº„É≥, Kuƒ´n) Second most powerful class of the Chess Pieces. The Queen insignia is a Queen- piece earring. =Diana= („Éá„Ç£„Ç¢„Éä) Diana is a former citizen of Caldia, the island nation of witches and wizards off the Southern Continent of M√ÑR-Heaven. Very little is known about her time in Caldia, though from what is known Diana and her sister Dorothy belonged to an aristocratic wizarding family.M√ÑR manga volume 15, chapter 154, page 8 It was Diana who trained Dorothy to use the √ÑRM Zephyrus Broom, as indicated by a flashback in the anime, and it is also possible she was its original wielder. It is also known that she made dolls for Dorothy and repaired them when they were broken, one of which became the Chess Pieces Knight Pinocchio. While to Caldia and her little sister, she was a caring figure and a well-liked citizen. Dorothy says that Diana insatiably coveted nearly everything since a young age.M√ÑR manga volume 9, chapter 88, page 14 It is also known that, fourteen years before the series, Diana snuck a Magic Stone into Lestava's queen, giving birth to Snow and giving her a connection to Koyuki. Diana's quotes in the manga, however, make it apparent that Snow's connection with Koyuki was formed through other events. 10 years before the series, motivated by an immense craving for power, she began to discard her loyalty to Caldia.M√ÑR manga volume 9, chapter 88, page 15 After releasing Phantom from Caldia's cell,M√ÑR manga volume 14, chapter 146, page 6 the two unsealed the OrbM√ÑR manga volume 9, chapter 93, page 7 which the sorcerers held under imprisonment and stole 798 √ÑRMs (including Babbo, which they downloaded the Orb into). They then fled Caldia to the outside world. After 2 years of wandering, Diana was chosen as Lestava kingdom's royal bride, with Lestava's king wishing for a new queen for the sake of Snow, who was saddened by the death of her mother, and the two instantly got along like a true mother and daughter.M√ÑR manga volume 9, chapter 89, page 5 During her rule of Lestava, Diana was respected by residents of the palace as a kind-hearted queen, because her malice was so well concealed. In secret, Diana was also enthroned as Chess Pieces' Queen, being one of the founders, and granted Phantom the title the no. 1 Knight. She also branded him with a Zombie Tattoo, which grants the wearer eternal life, as a reward.M√ÑR manga volume 9, chapter 90, page 1 With the uprise of the Chess Piece army, she moved on to the next step of her plan to conquer M√ÑR-Heaven: creating the Cross Guard, presenting them all with √ÑRMs for weapons, with the other-worlder Danna for leader.M√ÑR manga volume 9, chapter 89, page 7 Understandably, she was acknowledged as the one who walked M√ÑR-Heaven to victory, a position from which she could achieve her true goal - domination over Ginta Toramizu's world, wishing to use their advanced weapons and technology to defeat the much less developed people of M√ÑR-Heaven. With the king falling ill, Diana began to show her darker side, constantly ordering more delicacies, √ÑRMs, and also began to order Lestava's army to conquer new territory.M√ÑR manga volume 9, chapter 89, page 13 As more and more suspicious characters developed around Lestava Castle, Alan, one of Lestava's strongest knights and the Cross Guards second-in-command, led Snow to safety outside the castle. Diana is initially sinister, selfish, and uninterested in anything as long as those of a lower rank can do her biddings without fail. As the Chess Piece Queen she is one of the two heads of a twin- headed snake commanding the Chess army, made Lestava Castle a safe haven for the army, and shaping M√ÑR-Heaven into a land of war and destruction. Remaining in the background at all times, Diana pulls the strings of the Knights, using them as her ultimate weapons for her plan to conquer both M√ÑR-Heaven and Ginta's world. Unknown to anyone else, including herself, Diana's true self is still locked away inside of her, clouded by the influence and manipulation of the King, which was not reminded to her until the very end. Diana is introduced fairly late into the storyline, during the second round of the War Games. During that round she meets with Phantom and Peta, discussing the progress of the war and Team M√ÑR. During the War Games, it is shown she watches the battles from Lestava Castle, through her own personal, and overlarge crystal ball. Diana later reappears after Dorothy's battle with the Knight Rapunzel, who reveals to Dorothy how Diana is the Chess Pieces' Queen. Diana gives an order to Phantom to lead a large number of Rooks into Caldia and steal all of the remaining √ÑRMs, coincidentally the same time Team M√ÑR visits Caldia. Phantom, however, calls back the invasion following his battle with Ginta, surprised by how Ginta wounded him and deciding to immediately report this to his Queen. Diana, too, is impressed by how Ginta has grown, and realizes that soon he will become a great threat. Diana later orders Magical Roe to capture Snow in a battle against her in the 6th round of the War Games, which he does reluctantly. With Snow in her possession, Diana's plan to take control over both worlds began to fully bloom, watching the other world through the eyes of Ginta's mother. Following Phantom's next battle with Ginta, which ends in Ginta's victory, Diana scolds Phantom for losing and casts him away as a useless and outdated weapon. Dorothy later takes on Diana which ends with Dorothy successfully killing her. She does regain her loving personality before she dies. Diana's √ÑRM consists of: * ??? - An unnamed Nature √ÑRM that conjures purple slime that surrounds a person and turns them into a slime monster. It only appeared in the anime. * Aeros Staff - The scepter Weapon √ÑRM mere possession of which symbolizes Diana's supremacy and which manifests the power she holds, having the blood of Dorothy's veins run in hers - wind mastery. * Cerberus - Invoking her choker Guardian √ÑRM, Diana conjures three voids which upon contact will release the chain binding this Netherworld monstrosity that resembles a dog with 2 snake heads on its shoulder. * Dalia - Named for the Lithuanian goddess of fertility, this belt Ghost √ÑRM fuses Diana's body with wings and claw in resemblance to a harpy. * Death Cube - A Darkness √ÑRM which locks a person inside a fluorescent Rubik's Cube. It's designed to open only when the cube is solved (which must be dealt with extra meticulosity), and is fail-safed to claim the riddle solver's life afterwards. It only appeared in the anime. * Octopus - A Guardian √ÑRM that takes the form of a gigantic octopus. * Pinocchio II - A Guardian √ÑRM that resembles a giant remade version of her puppet Knight Pinocchio in √ÑRM form. * Ring of Ends - A Nature √ÑRM that creates poisonous wheel of mists. It only appeared in the manga. * World Tunneler - An unnamed Unique √ÑRM tat forms a large bubble that engulfs human beings. When it engulfed Snow, it used her connection to Koyuki to open a portal between the two worlds. Knights („Éä„Ç§„Éà, Naito) In the Chess combat force's hierarchy, Knights are top members highest ranked for their powers. The number of Knights is strictly within 13, making up the alias Zodiac Knights („Çæ„Éá„Ç£„Ç¢„ÉÉ„ÇØ„ÅÆ„Éä„Ç§„Éà, Zodiakku no Naito) - each Knight has a Zodiac constellation correspondence,M√ÑR manga, chapter 56, page 15 with the 13th as the number one Knight, Phantom. Each Chess Piece dubbed as a Knight would have an insignia earring (the knight piece in a chess game) bestowed upon him/her, usually by Phantom. There are two unnamed members that were only shown in episode 69, their positions were probably taken over by Rolan and Chimera as they died in the First War. =Phantom= („Éï„Ç°„É≥„Éà„É† Fantomu) The leader of the Knights, Phantom was born thirty years before the main part of the series takes place in the magical island nation of Caldia within M√ÑR- Heaven.M√ÑRmanga volume 14, chapter 145, page 16 At age ten, while exploring Caldia's Floating Castle, he discovered Caldia's Orb, a magical orb in which was sealed the consciousnesses of the world's greatest evils. Seduced by the orb, he began to visit nearly every day until discovered by the guards and is discreetly sentenced to death at the hand of his parents by Caldia's laws.M√ÑR manga volume 14, chapter 146, page 4 Unwilling to do so, however, they committed suicide (by hanging in the manga, and with a knife originally intended for their son's murder in the anime). Because of this, Phantom, having no other relatives, was imprisoned for life.M√ÑR manga volume 14, chapter 146, page 5 Phantom's reactions to his parents' decision differ in the original version and anime adaption: in the manga, he regards it as an act of profound love towards their son, while in the anime he rejects it as a wish forced on him which ultimately ruined his life and only accepts it as a form of love when reminded by Candice's love at the end of his existence. Being the primary villain throughout most of the story, although he appears suave on the outside, Phantom is sadistic, callous and like other Chess Pieces, revels in bloodshed and destruction. He especially likes to be entertained at all times, hoping during each Great War that a strong enemy will appear and trying his best to make each battle as enjoyable as possible, even to the point of allowing Ginta's power to grow equal to his. As opposed to the main protagonists, who respect life and unite in their love for M√ÑR-Heaven, he considers humans vile, rotten and above all, seeks emancipation from their transient lifespan with its natural weaknesses by means of immortality. Despite this, he appreciates certain human values such as courage. As the Chess Pieces' de facto commander, Phantom rules the four classes with an iron fist, tolerating no cowardice in his men or even haphazard killings of lowerclass members. At the same time, his charisma elicits great love and respects from many of his followers, i.e. Rolan, Peta and Candice. Later in the story (more obviously shown in the anime than the manga), Phantom's revealed to treasure those who are close to him, and his desire for eternity partly originates from his unwillingness to part with them. On occasions, he openly laments his solitude in their passings: his parents, Alma, and in the course of the War Game, his best friend Peta. After another 2 years, the Chess Pieces gathered enough power to wage war against M√ÑR-Heaven and Phantom, in command of its thousand fighters, quickly suppressed every opposing force. In reply, the kingdom of Lestava, M√ÑR-Heaven's sovereign superpower, incorporated a mass of worldwide fighters into a retaliating army, the Cross Guard. The Chess Pieces, in an attempt to fight off the Cross Guard, then initiated the War Games. During the last round of the War Games, Phantom and Danna fought to a draw; both of them ended up dead. Phantom's body is buried in a graveyard known to the Chess Pieces only, visited by Peta every year. 10 years later, Phantom was rescued by Diana, and out of mesmerization with her beauty and convictions, became her faithful follower.M√ÑRmanga volume 14, chapter 146, page 6 They stole 798 √ÑRMs from Caldiaa's vault and Babbo (with the Orb's soul downloaded into it), then deserted Caldia for a journey across M√ÑR-Heaven, recruiting warriors for the army they called Chess Pieces. In 2 years' time, Phantom befriended Peta and fell in love with Alma, a Vestrian sailor - until Diana was chosen as the bride of Lestava kingdom and enthroned herself Queen of the Chess Pieces. With the mantle of Chess Pieces' number 1 Knight and the completion of its construction falling onto Phantom, Diana bestowed on him the Zombie Tattoo, making him unkillable and thus, undefeatable. This, however, resulted in the wane of Phantom's romance: while he was infatuated with immortality and believed it would deliver him of the flawed, limited human existence, Alma sought the opposite, respecting its constant cycle of death and rebirth. Seeing the disharmony, each took their own leave and Phantom set out on another journey to assemble brethren whose ideals were akin to his. When Ginta defeated Phantom in the final rounds of the second War Games, Candice carried Phantom's body away back to his room. Diana was not happy that Phantom lost and cast him aside. Only Candice, Rolan, and the Ghost Chess remained loyal to Phantom. Phantom met his demise when Alviss inserted the Purific Ave into the hole on his chest. Phantom's √ÑRM consists of: * Allu Majuu - A Unique-typed √ÑRM in the shape of a fiendish flame orb chained to a black halberd. When ordered, the orb will enlarge itself and engulf opponents, killing them in a deadly explosion. * Hexagonal Shards - Another Unique-typed √ÑRM, a mass of hexagonal fragments. In its defense mode the fragments construct an impenetrable shield, and when discharged in attack mode they will launch consecutive shoots at the target. When inactive, these are kept along Phantom's sewed on arm, giving the effect of scales. * Phantom Cannon - A Unique-typed √ÑRM that releases blasts of energy from his palm. The beam is extremely powerful and nearly destroyed Babbo's Puss in Boots form. It only appeared in the anime. * Phantom Glass - A Unique-typed √ÑRM, a mirror which traps opponents inside it and shatters after a short amount of time (presumably coherent to the victim's magic level in the manga, while works on a mechanism with an hourglass in the anime) sharing the trapped ones a same fate. Phantom also uses this to kill cowards in the Chess Pieces. * Soul Infinitia - A ghostly Darkness √ÑRM that takes the form of a darkly colored ribbon. After draining the life force of all around it besides the user, it launches itself at its master's intended target. * I (Eins) - Guardian √ÑRM, the sentient type, a knight-armored creature which attacks with a long spear. Destroyed during his battle with Ginta. It can be said Eins is the strongest of the five guardians Phantom summoned at once. * II (Zwei): Remrace - Guardian √ÑRM, the insentient type, one of the only two to be named and strongests - a Herculean version of these common dark souls. Destroyed during his battle with Ginta. * III (Drei) - Guardian √ÑRM, the insentient type, a muscularly built wood monster. Destroyed during his battle with Ginta. * IV (Vier) - Guardian √ÑRM, the insentient type, a four-legged puppet with its head twisted upwards. Special ability: crossing space. Destroyed during his battle with Ginta. * V (F√ºnf): Dead Dragon - Guardian √ÑRM, the insentient type, one of the only two to be named and strongest. It resembles a dragon with decaying skins and reeky breath. Destroyed during his battle with Ginta. * VI (Sechs) - Guardian √ÑRM, the insentient type, a gigantic stuffed rabbit with a sewn mouth which, each time it opens, will release a destructive beam. Destroyed during his battle with Ginta. * VII (Sieben) - Guardian √ÑRM, the sentient type, a Humpty Dumpty-like midget, donning an outfit of late 18th/earlier 19th century style (as its top hat and cane suggest). Not much of its ability is known but it can be said Sieben as the weakest as seen when he tried to run away rather than fight. Destroyed during his battle with Ginta. * VIII (Acht) - Guardian √ÑRM, the insentient type, a rock monster. Destroyed during his battle with Ginta. * IX (Neun) - Guardian √ÑRM, the insentient type, a levitating cloaked monster with invisible gloved hands and a log for a head. Destroyed during his battle with Ginta. * X (Zehn) - Guardian √ÑRM, the sentient type, a hooded skeletal phantom which assails the opponent emotionally. Special ability: once the opponent falls for its words, X's outwardly harmless appearance will transform into a more malignant one and finishes the prey. Destroyed during his battle with Ginta. =Peta= („Éö„Çø) Very little is known about Peta's early background. At some point he would befriend Phantom, a Caldian outlaw and eventually the strongest Knight, some point before Phantom received the Zombie Tattoo.M√ÑR manga volume 14, chapter 142, page 4 Shortly before that Peta witnessed the breakup of Phantom and his lover, the Vestrian Alma. At some point, apparently after Alviss, Peta would receive Phantom's Zombie Tattoo, wishing to walk the path of destruction together for all eternity. After the formation of the Chess Piece army, Peta quickly gained Knighthood and became the Knights' strategic officer. Peta, however, did not fight in the previous War Games, choosing instead to broadcast the battles throughout M√ÑR-Heaven.M√ÑR manga volume 14, chapter 141, page 4 After Phantom's death in his fight with Danna, Peta was initiated as the Chess army's leader until Phantom's eventual resurrection, as he explained to the Cross Guard. At some point during his leadership, Peta would meet Eileen, a woman ripped to shreds from torture, and accepted her into the Chess Pieces, granting her forbidden Ghost √ÑRM to make this task easier.M√ÑR manga volume 13, chapter 136, page 4 Under Peta's tutelage, Eileen, from then on known as Chimera, would one day rise to the rank of Knight. It is also known that Peta would commonly send in thieves to the Cave of Babbo,M√ÑR manga volume 1, chapter 7, page 4 locked inside of which was Phantom's former √ÑRM, in an attempt to gain possession of Babbo and resurrect Phantom. Peta is one of M√ÑR- Heaven's darkest and most mysterious figures. Usually calm and intelligent, Peta knows just the right amount of effort needed to put into anything, and is also sly and cunning. Peta is, literally, a very bloodthirsty figure, and has a habit of drinking the blood of others in a skull-emblazed wine glass.M√ÑR manga volume 14, chapter 142, page 9 Like other Chess Pieces, Peta shares the view that humans are worthless beings. Peta is also one of Phantom's most loyal followers, and is subject to any of Phantom's beliefs. Phantom himself admits that he considers Peta his friend.M√ÑR manga volume 14, chapter 149, page 8 Peta was responsible for causing the massacre at Luberia's fort which made him a target of Nanashi. When it came to his fight with Nanashi, Peta was killed by Nanashi who used his Griffin Lance on him. Phantom arrives and obliterates Peta's body as he bids him farewell. Peta's √ÑRM consists of: * Abyss Cannon - A Ghost √ÑRM where tortured souls are called from hell and fired at the enemy as a mouthed cannonball. * Blood Body - A Nature √ÑRM which recreates the body of the user into blood, thus immunizes it against all physical attacks. * Blood Syringe - A Unique √ÑRM where spiked glass orbs are created and launched at the victim(s). If they hit, they will drain blood from the target until they burst, at which point the blood flows at the master of the √ÑRM. The user can then Coagulate the blood into different weapons, including bladed stones to throw at the living enemies. * Body Eye - Peta's opera necklace Guardian √ÑRM which calls forth upon earth a wingless Diablo with runic bonds sealing its lower half. However, the demon doesn't possess any satanic extraordinary. Its power manifests in a myriad of bats while Body Eye itself wrecks massive destruction with its hands. * Chain Soldier - A Guardian √ÑRM that summons several armored soldiers linked together with chains used to ensnare Peta's enemies. However, the soldiers are useless without their chains. It only appeared in the anime. * Dark Reflector - A Dimension √ÑRM. In the manga, a round mirror which bounces attacks back away from the user, while the anime pictures it as a portal which absorbs the attack and then blasts it back in the caster's direction. * Garnet Claw - A Ghost √ÑRM. It is a set of razor-sharp blood-colored claws that are made from the users fingernails. * Magic Mirror Ring - A Dimension √ÑRM, used to record something then allow him to broadcast it over any/multiple reflective surfaces (even the moon and Sun) or through other communication type dimension √ÑRMs. This is how people watch the War Games when the fighting takes place somewhere else. Strangely, even after Peta's demise the battles are broadcast throughout M√ÑR- Heaven. * Sickle Death - A Weapon √ÑRM that resembles a scythe engraved with a gory vulture's head. =Halloween= : Adult Halloween : Child Halloween ' is the third strongest Knight and the third in command, losing out to Peta only for the latter's intelligence. Halloween was abandoned as a child by his parents, who gave him the name of Pump', and was often bullied by other children in his town. During his childhood, Pump also developed a penchant for dismembering small animals, such as dogs. Despite this and the town's disliking towards him, Pump's childhood friend, Alan, still remained friends with him. One day, however, Alan showed Pump an √ÑRM that creates flames. Attracted to it, Pump thieved the √ÑRM, murdered the children who bullied him, and left the village, but not before telling Alan they would always be different people. At some point, Pump joined the Chess Pieces and taking on the title of Halloween where he would chain himself to a cross √ÑRM and would eventually rise to the rank of Knight. As fate would have it, Halloween would fight Alan, who had joined the Cross Guard, and the fight ended in a draw. Even to today Halloween still holds a deep hatred for Alan inside of his crippled heart. Halloween is a most sadistic character, taking enjoyment in the pain and sufferings of others. Like other Chess Pieces, Halloween takes enjoyment out of slowly killing his enemies in battle. A lover of war and bloodshed, Halloween is often put in charge of Chess Piece operations, particularly major invasions. Halloween has a fancy for punishing lower-ranked Chess Pieces, as seen with him enjoying the mental torment of Ian when informed about the upcoming punishment of his lover, Gido. When Ian threatens to escape and murder Halloween, Halloween responds by mockingly wishing Ian really was strong enough to kill him.M√ÑR manga volume 4, chapter 32, page 6 Halloween's love of torment and punishment extends even to his fellow Knights, commonly making death threats to Rapunzel should her greed get out of hand. Several times he is the pun of a joke about tomatoes because of his mask, which is mistaken for a tomato, earning him the nickname \\"Tomato Head\\" from Alan. Deep inside however, Halloween is still the cowardly child he was when under his former name, as pointed out by Alan. Halloween first appeared to inform Loco and Ian that the mission to kidnap Snow had been canceled. Following a rampage through the port city of Vestry alongside Chimera, Halloween punished Ian by sentencing his lover, Gido, to torture. Just prior to the War Games' 3rd Round, Halloween gives Pozun the order to enter Alan into the War Games. Alan and Halloween at last had the confrontation they'd been waiting for during the final round of the War Games. During the fight Halloween goes on a killing rampage among the audience members by sending Alan blows he can easily dodge only for them to hit the audience. After Alan willingly takes each attack Halloween sends, Halloween reveals his identity of Pump, much to Alan's horror. Halloween goes on with the battle, hoping that Alan will eventually succumb to him and leave the defenseless audience vulnerable. Alan, however, no longer holds back and manages to wound Halloween. Halloween responds by unleashing his Guardian, Wanka Tanka, which nearly manages to kill Alan if Alan had not unleashed the Guardian he got in Caldia, Saint Anger, to destroy Halloween's. Defenseless, Halloween is then picked up by Alan's Guardian, thrown, and punched skyward. With Halloween being thrust into the sky to unknown whereabouts, Alan is named victor with Halloween's apparent demise. Halloween's √ÑRM include: * ???? - Nature √ÑRM, an unnamed bracelet √ÑRM that creates flames formerly belonging to Alan during his childhood, Halloween having stolen it. * Antares - Nature √ÑRM, creates balls of flame of multiple sizes used to throw at the enemy. * Cross Dagger - Weapon √ÑRM, the very cross tied to Halloween's back, that turns into, and shoots missiles of flame. Edited into a pole in the American dub. * Flame Hand - Nature √ÑRM which is used to create hands for Halloween, since he got himself tied to the cross. * Grave Hail - Darkness √ÑRM, crosses, with several eyes and mouths on them, which shoots up from underground, similar to Alviss' 13 Totem Pole's Guardian style. Edited into polls in the American dub. In the anime this √ÑRM instead summons several coffins, with the same eyes and mouths, which open up to reveal skeleton warriors to do Halloween's bidding. * Igniel - A Darkness √ÑRM. Although specific details are unknown, it basically merges two living creatures together, as seen with Alan and Edward. Its apparent side effect may be decrease of age, or deformity. * Napalm Death - Weapon √ÑRM which grows a large blossom from the back of Halloween's cross that shoots flames like a cannon. * Sticks of Fire - Nature √ÑRM, two sticks with the tips on fire that shoots blasts of flame at the enemy, held by Halloween using Flame Hand. Left unnamed in the manga. * Trick-Or-Treat - A Guardian √ÑRM that creates explosive plant creatures with Jack-O-Lantern heads. * Wakan Tanka - A Guardian √ÑRM. Though embodying the \\"divine sacred\\", summoning through Halloween's cross pendant √ÑRM has minimized the \\"Great Spirit\\"'s omnipotence to the giant form of a winged skeleton-bodied skull, albeit retains some of its ascendancy - the scorching flame it breathes. =Chimera= („Ç≠„É°„É© Kimera, \\"Chimera\\") Real name Erin, her appearance, masked or unmasked, is generally anomalous for her gender. She usually dons a ghastly skeletal mask with a green wig attached to it, concealing her blonde hair color (the green color is possibly exclusive to only the anime, however, as the cover of volume 13 shows a blonde-haired masked Chimera). She was about to marry an ex-Chess Piece, but villagers disrupted the wedding and seized and murdered her fianc√©. The villagers then capture Chimera herself after revealing to her that they murdered her fianc√©. Chimera is tortured for days in hopes that she will reveal the location of the remaining Chess Pieces. She finally escapes, only to find that her body is deformed due to the torture she endured like a scar across her face and missing her right eye. She is recruited to the Chess Pieces by Peta, who offered her a Ghost √ÑRM. Since her enlisting for the Chess Pieces she's fashioned her hair spiky, a mode far more commonly styled for males, and (exclusively for the anime) builds up her stature into a more masculine form, misleading people about her actual gender.M√ÑR manga volume 13, chapter 134, last page In addition to these extraordinary outward features, Chimera's facial appearance carries hideously unique traits: she wears a grotesque mass of eyeballs on the side of her face to replace her lost eye, stitches a horizontal black line on the scar across her nose's bridge, and seasons the overall gruesome sight by piercing her Knight insignia earring on the tip of her tongue. Out of the 13 Zodiac Knights, Chimera is by far the most mysterious. In her every seldom appearance until the Final Battles of the War Games, Chimera never takes off her mask, nor is she seen conversing with anyone in words. Always shielding her emotions behind the skull face, Chimera possesses the silence of a beast, and also the humanity of one: she's ruthless in battles, and is a barbarous warrior, once seen ripping apart a Cross Guard soldier thrusting at her. Her savagery is commended by even the 3rd-in-command Knight Halloween;M√ÑR manga volume 4, chapter 32, page 5 and her prowess is hinted to be one of the most noteworthy among the Knights: Alan of Team M√ÑR once remarks he didn't notice her in the 1st War Game, which allegedly implies either she moved up to the 4th seat of the Chess Zodiac in a matter of only 6 years' times from a previous unknown lower rank, or that she entered the Chess after the 1st War Game and managed to occupy it after only 6 years (which was precisely the case).M√ÑR manga volume 13, chapter 134, page 4 Pozun, referee of the War Game, too esteemed surviving a fight with Chimera - be the fight itself a loss- as an impressive deed (even when the survivor in question is Gaira, 3rd-in-command of Cross Guard, the Chess' nemesis in the 1st War).M√ÑR manga volume 5, chapter 42, page 6 When stripped of her mask, Chimera's personality is shown to be an overly sarcastic and scornful one, reflected in the jeers she attributes to others, e.g. Gaira whom she outfought, and Dorothy when her attacks were merely sufficient enough to land her but one blow. She's also resolutely resentful of the world, claiming she will never forsake her path of destruction, War Game or not;M√ÑR manga volume 13, chapter 138, page 1 and refuses to decline herself to be sympathized by opponents.M√ÑR manga volume 13, chapter 135, last page Besides killings, Chimera appears to have interest in disfiguring (pretty) woman body, hints at having an entire collection of it.M√ÑR manga volume 13, chapter 136, page 8 Despite all this fiendishness, Chimera still has her own emotional insecurities, being easily irritated/incited to losing concentration. In the final round of the War Games, Chimera faced off against Dorothy where Chimera's true form was revealed. Dorothy managed to defeat Chimera who then escapes. Ian pursues Chimera in order to get revenge on the transformation that she performed on Gido. Their fight didn't last long. Before she dies, Chimera gives Ian the √ÑRM that would undo Gido's transformation. Chimera was reunited with Marco in the afterlife. Chimera's √ÑRM consists of: * Chimaira - Far surpassing its monstrous mythological origin, this Ghost √ÑRMs drill-handed body synchronizes with Chimera's insanity to bring into existence a demon of monstrosity beyond belief. * Four-Eyed Fish - Guardian √ÑRM, summons 4 eyed grotesque flying fish. * Ghost Eye - A unnamed Ghost √ÑRM, that gives the user a large number of eyes on side of their face which Chimera used to replace the right eye that she lost when she was tortured. Whether or not this has an actual purpose is unknown, it does reflect Chimera's Inhumanity. This was one of three Ghost √ÑRMs Peta gave to Chimera. * Ghost Tail - Ghost √ÑRM, a sharp rag tail. * Howling Demon - Ghost √ÑRM, turns the user's hand into a salivating stretching monster's mouth which shoots energy. This was one of three Ghost √ÑRMs Peta gave to Chimera. * Hydra - A Ghost/Guardian √ÑRM that merges the user with a serpentine monster. From the darkest thread of legend this immemorial demon is brought forth and, merging with her deteriorated sanity, manifests a creature of such even Chimera would dread. It only appeared in the anime. * Monster Arm - An unnamed ring Ghost √ÑRM. Turns the user's hand into a stretching skeletal monster-headed arm with sharp, canine teeth. This was one of three Ghost √ÑRMs Peta gave to Chimera. * Ogre Hand - Ghost √ÑRM, turns the user's hands into long, giant clawed stretching arms. =Rolan= („É≠„É©„É≥ Roran) At some point early in Rolan's childhood, Rolan's parents died to unknown circumstances, leaving a poor and starving Rolan to live on the streets. Rolan was always ignored by the others, and Rolan himself would have died under such a living eventually. At one point, a number of kids stealing food bumped into Rolan and left a large amount of food around him, leaving the owner of the stolen food to blame Rolan and severely abuse him, putting Rolan in an even worse state than before. Just after this, Rolan was found by Phantom, the leader of the Chess Pieces. Phantom became the only one to treat Rolan with kindness, giving him food to survive. Just before Phantom left, he asked Rolan if he would follow him, which was followed by Rolan taking Phantom's hand and the two walking out of Rolan's home village together. Rolan, having a wish to serve Phantom, would join the Chess Pieces. According to Alan, Rolan fought in the first War Games as a Rook. Girly behaviour, stuttering speech and possessing a Zombie Tattoo, Rolan of the Knights class is Alviss of Team M√ÑR's direct counterpart. The one prime difference between them is that while Alviss' feeling for Phantom is sheer hatred, Rolan's is love, keeping him Phantom's company on the path to eternity. This is incomprehensible to others, given Phantom's fearful figure, but understandable for him, as Rolan once experienced Phantom's considerate side. He doesn't like to fight if it isn't necessary, as seen in episode 29, but will do anything Phantom asks of him. In the final episodes of the series, Rolan is sent to retrieve Alviss by Phantom but is shocked to find his friend and Candice have seemingly abandoned him and in sadness he tries to commit suicide by stabbing himself through the throat, but is seen alive in the last episode. Rolan's √ÑRM consists of: * Ailes'd Angel - The flocks of feather Nature √ÑRM that adorn Rolan's right shoulder which wing him for mid-air combats. The wings can shoot out an endless stream of razor-sharp feathers. * Cockatrice - The bell Guardian √ÑRM at the end of a chain seen at Rolan's waist that calls for the giant eagle of legend and its lethal petrifying breaths. The √ÑRM requires an esoteric incantation to activate. * Dark Cage - Another unique √ÑRM type, sends out a giant bird cage to trap opponents. This may be a downgraded version of Alviss' Darkness √ÑRM Caged Bird. * Dark Ribbon - Nature √ÑRM, ties adversaries in one fatal grip with the roots of the Dark Roses, which weaken them by sucking out their energy. It only appeared in the anime. * Electric Cage - The unique √ÑRM type, summons a cage inside which the trapped one cannot use √ÑRMs, and will take on an immense electric jolt at each attempt to get out. It only appeared in the anime. * Rapier Whip - A Weapon √ÑRM, a sword that can stretch its blade like a whip and explodes when its tip touches an opponent. The anime also shows it having the ability to split to create more arms to use as whips. In the manga, it was destroyed in his battle with Alviss in the final rounds, but the anime shows him using it after this battle. * Stone Cube - Rolan's Nature √ÑRM which makes giant stones cubes to crush the enemy or explode with him/her. He can also make a snake out of magma using this √ÑRM:  Magma Snake - Using boulders and lava flowing around, the user creates a giant snake from the Stone Cubes. NOTE: It is possible that his personality is that of Roland from the epic poem, The Song of Roland. Roland is depicted in the poem as heroic, brave, and amazing. In reality, he was just that, so it could be that Rolan of the Chess Pieces' personality is derived as the same of that of Rolan from the epic poem. =Weasel= („É¥„Ç£„Éº„Ç∂„É´ Vƒ´zaru, \\"V√≠√∞arr\\") Weasel is the oldest of the Knights (84 years old), but nevertheless a nimble fighter. He is easily distinguished due to his eccentric appearance with a tree growing out of his head containing all his magic power, and always seen holding a wood cane inside which he hides all his √ÑRMs. As a Chess Piece he's wicked, but is overall an amicable figure to his Chess fellows, and is civil enough towards his opponents. In the 1st War Games, Weasel fought Jack's father, Jake and grasped victory using his Guardian Bird of Rotten Wood, leaving Jake fatally wounded (and dying at his home shortly thereafter, which was unknown to Weasel). He plays little to no role in the 2nd War, save for once in the War campaign when he took over Henli castle by his trees, and like most of the Chess Pieces spends the War Games observing the fights. He takes special notice of Jack since his debut of victory, for the boy also masters his wood element and uses Jake's memento scoop. He fights Jack in the final round of the 2nd War Games and is defeated by him, who used Kikazoku Fire to burn the tree on his head, eliminating the source of his power. Weasel compliments Jack by telling him that he has surpassed his father after his defeat. Weasel is a plant Guardian √ÑRM user and the √ÑRMs in his possession consist of: * Bird of Rotten Wood - Guardian √ÑRM, a bird born with wooden structure of such blighted plant that will wither any greens to its own bleak figure. * Bomb Grass - A Nature √ÑRM which summons a strange kind of exploding plants. * Deadly Field - A Darkness √ÑRM, used to wither all the plants around the users, with the exception of the tree on top of Weasel's head. * Floating Leaf - A Nature √ÑRM, a large leaf that is used by the user to float in the air. * Seed Cannon - A Nature √ÑRM summoning cannons to fire fruits and vegetables as bullets. * Yggdrasil - A Guardian √ÑRM which calls out an enormous, invincible tree. Weasel can control various parts of the tree for an attack. In the anime, it feeds on the suffering of others to grow very large.  Dance of the Leaves - An attack of Yggdrasil, many leaves launch themselves towards the enemy and cuts them.  Snaky Bow - An attack of Yggdrasil, grows large 'snakes' out of the tree's branches used to attack the enemy. =Ian= („Ç§„Ç¢„É≥) On the surface, Ian appears to be a laid-back, jovial young man who (even when he was still a low-ranked Rook) is one of the few Chess Pieces to have the nerve to be blunt and disrespectful towards his superiors. For example, Ian would snap back at Halloween who is one of the highest-ranked Knights, and in his quest for vengeance later on, challenging even the Knights. Ian's amiable manners, however, belies the lethal, battle-thrilled fighter he can be in the battlefield. Once driven by determination he is relentless in his pursuit, be it a simple case of getting the fight he enjoys or the venture to eliminate a superior sworn enemy. Ian's tenacity is prone to lead him go against his orders, and Ian admits because of it, he is always mentally prepared for death penalty.Ian: \\"Since it's my style to take on a fight I would enjoy, I went in preparation of getting punished\\" M√ÑR -M√ÑR Heaven-, Episode 58, \\"Ian's Anger\\". Although his affiliation evidences the contrary, Ian is a man of high morals - in fact, it was his idealistic dream to purify the world instead of selfish desires like most other Chess Pieces that urged him to join it in the first place.Gido: \\"Let's become Knights together. When Phantom revives, we'll clean up this world\\" M√ÑR -M√ÑR Heaven-, Episode 12, \\"Luberia's Boss, Nanashi\\", Akt 32, \\"OVER THE SEA\\" He cares for his girlfriend, Gido, deeply: his love for her outweighs his ideals and well-being, and later becomes his motivation in battle throughout the series. His upright nature attracts great respect from his opponent, Ginta, and though the sympathy doesn't align their causes, it eventually manages to diminish their initial enmity. In the War Games arc, after Chimera, the culprit that victimised Gido by turning her into a worm, is defeated by Dorothy, Ian chases after her in an attempt to avenge his girlfriend. Eventually, after Chess is disbanded, Ian manages to track Chimera down and kills her. Ian then takes one of Chimera's Arms which allows him to recover Gido's original self. Afterwards, the couple takes refuge in a nearby village in fear of being killed by Chess haters, which coincidentally, is also the same village where Ash takes refuge in. After Ginta defeats Caldia's Orb, Ian and Gido settles in the village where they took refuge in happily ever after. Ian's √ÑRMs consist of: * √ÑRM Break - A Weapon √ÑRM when activated various weapons sprout forth from Ian's body or clothes. * Demonic Bond - A ring Darkness √ÑRM which creates a chain binding the user and the opponent, used to wear out both's magic by draining their blood. If either the opponent's or user's magical power completely runs out, their life will be taken and the match will be over. * Iron Maiden - A ring Darkness √ÑRM that takes the shape of the Iron Maiden upon summoning. Anyone who touches the Iron Maiden, or who is bound to it, will be unable to use Holy √ÑRMs. * Moon Fall - A Weapon √ÑRM that creates multiple crescent-shaped blades and the user throws them at the opponent. * Octopus - An 8-armed whip Weapon √ÑRM with regenerative ability. After his training in the Shuuren no Mon, he upgrades it into a more deadly weapon with various forms, the Octopus 2.  Octopus II - Weapon √ÑRM, a more powerful version of Octopus with various sharp weapons at the tip of each tentacle. * Peryton - A ring Guardian √ÑRM from which Ian calls forth the mutated hybrid of legend possessing greater prowess than its said origin is depicted. * Python Whip - A pair of Weapon √ÑRMs that are snake-shaped whips. By concealing these in the long sleeves of his clothes, Ian is able to quickly strike with them before his opponent can see them, serving good confusion. =Magical Roe= („Éû„Ç∏„Ç´„É´„Éª„É≠„Ç¶ Majikaru Rou) Magical Roe is a clown directly under Queen Diana's command during her reign in Lestava. When Diana's stepdaughter Princess Snow was little, she cried often and it was during one of those times that Diana introduced Lou to her. For her entertainment, he always demonstrated many circus tricks and as they grew close, became her favorite babysitter and childhood friend. However, later the two parted ways, at an unknown point in Snow's life and under unknown circumstances. Magical Roe was present at Phantom's revival. In the 2nd War, he was seen with Phantom and the other Knights after the 3rd Round. Magical Roe reappeared in the War Games and fought Snow herself in the 6th round (secretly obeying Diana's order to kidnap Snow) and told Snow that he didn't join the Chess Pieces, he was with the Chess Pieces to begin with. He did manage to play around with Snow as a way of tiring her down. While struggling with the thought of betraying his princess himself, Magical Roe still proceeded with his mission and eventually managed to take Snow back to the Lestava headquarter, winning the Game fight by default. After the War Games' Final Battles when Team M√ÑR stormed Lestava Castle, he fought off Nanashi, Alan, and Gaira to prevent them from reaching Snow and ended up defeated, regretting his actions. In the anime adaption, instead he fought Alan and Ginta, and after his loss, Roe sacrificed his life to save Snow from Diana's Darkness √ÑRM, atoning for his wrongdoings towards the princess. Magical Roe uses circus-themed √ÑRM which consists of: * Blade Ball - A Weapon √ÑRM that creates a ball with sharp blades extending from it. * Bubble Lion - A Nature √ÑRM that resembles a bubble hoop creating lion-shaped bubbles to attack. * Fire Wheel - A Nature √ÑRM that create flame hoops to attack the target. Destroyed during his battle with Snow. * Mimic Medallion - A unique √ÑRM that mimics the ability of an opponent's √ÑRM (i.e. summons the same Guardian his opponent's √ÑRM calls, but their power differ in accordance to the user's power). * Nightmare - A Guardian √ÑRM that creates many eyed, sharp- toothed spherical objects which fly around and attack. * Trump Soldier - A Guardian √ÑRM that creates card soldiers. Outlines of these soldiers can be seen in the background of the cover spread of the first chapter. =Galian= („Ç¨„É™„Ç¢„É≥ Garian) Galian is the former leader of the notorious thief guild Luberia, founding it as a sanctuary for the lowest of the world. As a leader he was an amicable figure and well loved by his subordinate thieves, and led Luberia in a peaceful reign - until the 1st War started. The birth of a homicidal Chess Pieces army begot disasters and destructions all over M√ÑR-Heaven, which, while seen as a bad thing for 'business' by many Luberians, set Galian on constant agitation, eager to test his power. His first encounter with the Chess was inside a havoc-wrought castle they occupied, and after defeating many Pawns, Galian faced the strategist Knight Peta. Although Galian was easily worsted, Peta still acknowledged his great potentials and let him go after provocatively advising him to invest his power in a worthier place. The 1st War Games concluded with the Chess' defeat, however that did little to help Galian's already triggered infatuation with their immense power. Predicting the Chess' inevitable return, he resolved to abandon Luberia and joined the Chess. During that time he found and saved a wounded man with no memory of his past life, but nevertheless endowed with latent might, whom he named Nanashi. Turning a deaf ear to his thieves' suspicion and cool reception towards Nanashi, Galian took Nanashi under his wings. To help him win Luberia's heart Galian sent a monster to the guild's fortress, which Nanashi outfought and earned him the respect of many, just like Galian wished. After that he trained Nanashi and when he was strong enough, he left his throne and the Electric Eyes √ÑRMs, symbols of Luberia's leader to Nanashi, erased all memories regarding him and went to Peta to accept his previous offer. Over the years, his name also faded from Luberia's memories itself as the thieves recognized Nanashi as their true leader. Although Galian severed all his ties to Luberia when he gave up on it, the news of Luberia's extermination (along with its ragged flag), brought to him by the perpetrator Peta himself, comes as a great personal blow, though he denies it by setting fire to the flag. Knowing Nanashi's nature and his reaction to this homicide, Galian anticipated the man's participation in the 2nd War Games and entered it thus, to prove he had chosen the right path. With Phantom's approval, he revealed himself to Nanashi in the 5th round after Ash's defeat and the two battled, Nanashi's memories of him gradually returning. He's defeated by Nanashi and compliments him for having become a fine leader, admitting his envy. At the end of the series, Nanashi and Galian rule Luberia together. Like Nanashi, he fights with lightning-themed √ÑRMs: * Electric Feather - A ring Weapon √ÑRM that creates feathers which emit electricity. * Electric Saucer (AKA Electric Frisbee) - A Nature √ÑRM consisting of electrified frisbees that Galian uses to circumnutate his opponent. This √ÑRM has an electric power that attacks and inhibits the opponent. * Hiraiken (AKA Lightning Rod Sword): A Nature √ÑRM that resembles a sword which absorbs lightning. If enough is stored, it will emit electricity. * Magic Rope - A Weapon √ÑRM that resembles an urn containing ropes which tie the opponent. These ropes can keep coming after their target even after being cut and the only way to stop them is to destroy the urn. It is shown in the anime that Galian must possess at least two of these. * Memory Eraser - A Darkness √ÑRM which erases memories. * Torpedine - A ring Guardian √ÑRM that summons a giant stingray with a mouth on its back that fires bolts of incredibly high voltage lightning at Galian's foes. =Ash= („Ç¢„ÉÉ„Ç∑„É• Asshu) Ash is easily distinguished by his mask: a grim reaper skull with its tongue sticking out. Ash joined the Chess Pieces in the hopes on using their immense power to conquer the world, ending all other wars countries might bring up, preventing the deaths of the children he loves. Ash's personality is rather unusual on Chess Piece standards, being both playful and fun-loving. Ash prefers to solve matters without fighting, urging the other knights during a meeting not to deal with Rapunzel's insolence. Phantom himself, who is one of the Knights' more sadistic members, states that he could never hate Ash, as he is \\"just that sort of person\\". Ash is almost always seen enjoyably playing with children, usually Defu, Ko, and Benni, three children he rescued from the war, when not fighting a battle. Ash is also very willing to take punishment, sometimes volunteering to be punished when he felt he did something wrong. Galian also states that Ash is usually not one to give up in battle. Ash's original design had little differences from his final one, the most notable being having a regular mask rather than a skull one.M√ÑR manga volume 3, chapter 20, page 8 Ash is first introduced revealing to Nanashi that an opponent, Galian, requests that Nanashi appears in the fifth round of the War Games, and also states to Ginta Toramizu as wish to fight him as well. During the fight, Ash chooses to use his Psycho Space on Ginta, claiming that he doesn't want children to see the rest of the battle. Once inside, when Ash reveals he joined the Chess Pieces to save the children he loves, and Ginta, angered, responds by yelling at Ash that the Chess Pieces would only kill those children by their own hands. After Ginta defeats Ash's Guardian, Ash gives up the fight, and tells Ginta that he supports Ginta's wish to save M√ÑR- Heaven. Ash, Defu, Ko, and Benni later watch Ginta's battle with Phantom together, and leave once Phantom is defeated. Ash, along with most other Chess Pieces, later is called for a meeting by Diana, and there Diana has King kill all of them, though Ash escapes. While leading survivors of the war to safety, Ash meets up with Ian and Gido, who themselves are escaping the Chess Pieces, and together the three search for Ginta while also closing various portals between the two worlds. Once they reunite with what remains of Team M√ÑR, Ash reveals to them King's plan to conquer both worlds. As Ash and Ginta close another portal later that night, King attempts to stop them, though Ash locks him in his Phsyco Space. The two then have a short battle, ending with Ash's death. Like others killed by King, Ash is revived following his death, and still allows his friends Ian and Gido to live with him. Ash's √ÑRM consists of: * Death - A pendant Guardian √ÑRM which conjures for Ash a goalie-masked monster with ability of his likes - the ability to separate its body. * Eingang - A ring Dimension √ÑRM which emits a beam Ash uses to fill the gap connecting Earth and M√ÑR-Heaven. It only appeared in the anime. * Psycho Space - A ring Dimension √ÑRM, creates a different dimension that cuts off the opponent's magic in half. * Shadowman - A Nature √ÑRM that allows Ash's shadow to attack his enemy. Ash can also use this to absorb attacks meant for him. * Split Parts - A pendant Dimension √ÑRM, allows the user to split his body to attack in different directions. When Ash first uses this, it freaks out all the members of Team M√ÑR. * Walking Bomb - A Weapon √ÑRM that resembles a bomb that enlarges itself every time a participant of the fight gets wounded and ignites when it gets large enough.  A sadomasochistic woman that wears an eyepatch over her right eye who relishes physical pains in a fight as pleasures. Before joining the Chess, Candice was a mercenary officer, and was feared by many for her violent and abusing personality. After a defeat by Phantom however, Candice fell in love with Phantom and followed him. Though this remains largely an unreciprocal passion, Candice still endeavours to undertake many demanding tasks (e.g. taking on powerful enemies) to get Phantom's commends, and is resolute to obliterate whoever obstructs his way. Candice first appeared during Phantom's revival and informed him that Queen Diana summoned him. During the Chess Pieces' war campaign, Candice single- handedly defeats the soldiers at Castle Geirelulu using Gorgon to turn them into stone. Candice reappeared during the 5th Round of the War Games and fought to a draw with Jack. After Phantom's defeat, Candice accompanies Phantom to Lestava's castle, and in the manga witnesses his death while he rests on his throne. In the anime Candice tries to help him escape from the pursuit by Team M√ÑR in the end of the Ghost Chess attack. Though this ends unsuccessfully, it deeply touches Phantom and partly lets him die in peace, knowing he after all isn't so hated. Her last appearance is with the revived Rolan, visiting Phantom's grave. Candice's √ÑRM consists of: * Boulder Axe - A large stone axe Weapon √ÑRM. * Boulder Claw - With this Nature √ÑRM Candice creates two giant sets of stone claws over her real hands that she attacks her opponent with. * Boulder Fang - A Nature √ÑRM that launches sharp rock shards from under her enemies.  Boulder Crush - Candice buries her opponent under the shards produced by Boulder Fang. * Gorgon - Fairly returning Candice's painstaking masochisms, her pendant √ÑRM evoke the awake of a giant Gorgon head and slowly petrifies to all whom its gaze beholds. * Grand Boulder - A Nature √ÑRM which creates giant boulders. * Kukan Teni - A magic stone embedded into her maimed right eye that she uses as a Dimension √ÑRM in order to exchange her position with another one. * Lamia - From its river dwelling, the alluring nymphs answers Candice's seek for aid with its lyre's enchanting melody, and should the situation warrants, with force far more destructive. * Scale of Blessing - A scale in the shape of a clock, used to measure the injuries her body takes and change them into enormous magic power to summon her Guardian √ÑRM. =Pinocchio= („Éî„Éé„Ç≠„Ç™„É≥ Pinokion) Smallest of the Knights, Pinocchio was once a marionette made by Diana for her little sister Dorothy when Dorothy was a child, and was apparently animated to life upon joining the Chess Pieces. In the 6th round, he was ordered to defeat Dorothy if he wished to become human. Like his namesake, his nose grows when he lies, but it transforms into a cannon after about three lies and can be used to shoot his opponents. In the War Games at the Mushroom Field, he is ripped apart by Dorothy's √ÑRM Toto with his remains salvaged by Chaton by the end of the 6th Round. In a filler episode, he was rebuilt with wagon wheels. Alongside Kouga and Girom, they ambushed Dorothy, Ginta and Alviss where Pinocchio destroyed Dorothy's Andarta at the time when Babbo gets cracked. After being repelled, Diana then sent them to capture Caldia's Grand Elder only to be defeated by Dorothy and Ginta. Also in the anime, they were last seen riding Kouga's Kung Fu Frog somewhere. Pinocchio is a Weapon √ÑRM user with his √ÑRM consisting of: * Fastitocalon - A Guardian √ÑRM that creates a giant whale to attack his foes. Those who are swallowed, save for the cursed Poko, ultimately die and are dissolved down to the bones thanks to its slimy digestive juices. * Saw Blade - A Weapon √ÑRM. Creates 3 saw-like swords Pinocchion can use as weapons. =Rapunzel= („É©„Éó„É≥„ÉÑ„Çß„É´ Rapuntseru, \\"Rapunzel\\") Rapunzel is the older sister of Girom. Their father died early of an illness, after which their mother became deranged and physically abused the siblings on a daily basis. Gradually driven to their limits, one day Rapunzel and her brother finally broke down and chopped their mother to death, then ran away. The scar of this matricide survives into her adulthood: Rapunzel grows up to be bloodthirsty, arrogant and riotous (to the irritation and exasperation of many Knights), and appears to share with her brother Girom (notably the only one she holds dear and is gentle with) a love for killing women. Despite being quite far from most visions of beauty herself, Rapunzel is shown to be helplessly narcissistic and looks down on everyone, men or women, as obnoxiously ugly. Rapunzel was present at Phantom's revival, and in the campaign of the 2nd War Games, she was responsible for the siege of Reginrave castle. Besides being with Girom watching the match between Ginta and Garon, Rapunzel was only seen outside once with the rest of the Knights after the 3rd Round. She persuaded Phantom to let her and Girom fight in the 4th Round. When someone on her team loses to Team M√ÑR, she challenges the loser of her team to a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors and ends up decapitating them if they lose. After Ginta defeated Girom, Rapunzel wanted to fight Ginta only for Dorothy to step in. She loses to Dorothy in the 4th round of the War Game. It was not after the 5th Round of the War Games that the deserving retribution was delivered: as punishment for slaying her comrades without his approval, Phantom has the Rook Ian battle and kill her (by decapitation in the manga and by incineration in the anime) in battle in front of Girom's eyes and usurp her Knighthood. Rapunzel's √ÑRM consists of: * Hair Master - A Nature √ÑRM allowing her to manipulate her already odd hair, turning it into several very sharp and hard, tentacle-like drills - an obvious pun on the name Rapunzel. * Ice Spikes - A Nature √ÑRM which creates several streams of giant icicles along the ground. It can also be used to make a sort of bear trap out of two spiked walls.  Spike Sandwich - After creating walls of ice spikes in the ground on either side of her opponent, Rapunzel flips the walls upward like the jaws of a bear trap, killing them. =Kouga= („Ç≥„Ç¶„Ç¨) Weakest and the largest of the Knights, Kouga is sensitive about his ugliness, due to which as a child he was always treated miserably. He's extremely arrogant and dense, and hates anyone with good looks, especially Alviss. He thinks people with good appearances carry dark hearts. Although his magical powers and √ÑRM strength are more along the Bishop class, Kouga obtained his Knight status thanks to his vast amount of strength and a sturdy stamina which takes in unusually low damage from the most destructive of attacks. Kouga appears cloaked throughout most of the series until the War Games' 6th round, wherein he fights Alviss and loses. In a filler episode of the anime, he teams up with Pinocchio and Girom to attack Dorothy, Ginta, and Alviss. After being repelled, Diana then sent them on a mission to kidnap the Caldian Grand Elder and is later defeated by Dorothy and Ginta. He is last seen (in the anime only) somewhere with Pinocchio and Girom riding Kung Fu frog. Kouga is a user of ninja-themed Weapon √ÑRMs which consists of: * Centipede - A Weapon √ÑRM that turns into a huge centipede attached to the user's hand to attack. * Daimonji - A Weapon √ÑRM that forms a giant, five-bladed shuriken. Kouga uses this in hand-to-hand combat. * Kung Fu Frog - A Guardian √ÑRM that summons a huge red frog to attack with martial arts. Its speed is said to be in the top class among Guardians. * Sand Hell - A Dimension √ÑRM that creates quicksand around his opponent's feet. * Smokescreen - A Nature √ÑRM which creates gray mist that can hide almost anything, even magic power. Bishops („Éì„Ç∑„Éß„ÉÉ„Éó, Bishoppu) The Bishops are the second-strongest group of the Chess Pieces after Knights. Each of the Bishops wears a bishop earring as an insignia; designed like a shield with a cross rather than the actual piece in chess. =Chaton= („Ç∑„É£„Éà„É≥) Chaton is a kitty girl and the strongest of the Bishops. Chaton is always happy, almost to an annoying level. She has a comical, yet entirely serious, crush on Alan, much to his distaste as Alan, ridiculously in contrast to his looks and due to a twist of his situation with Edward, is a cat phobic. She is a good friend with Loco, even though Chaton is quick to get on Loco's nerves. Chaton deeply cares for Loco and constantly looks out for her well-being, though this usually tends to annoy Loco. Chaton first appears in the 6th Round of the War Games and Alan was surprised at her appearance when she removed her hooded robe. She quickly manages to defeat Alan (who mistook her for a Knight before the battle began) due to his Cat phobia, which he inherited from Edward. During Halloween and Alan's battle, Chaton and Loco kept arguing over who would win while watching from a castle balcony. During Phantom and Ginta's battle, after Ginta's Puss in Boots was introduced, Chaton commented that it is \\"the greatest Guardian ever\\", making her the only one who took it seriously. In the anime, after the War Games are completed, she and Loco, while traveling through the desert, get captured by the Ghost Chess along with Team M√ÑR. Working together, all of them escape the Ghost Chess, although due to Loco's constant use of Darkness √ÑRM Loco is reverted into a baby. Chaton is quick to begin taking care of Loco, and later watches the death of Alan to King, much to her horror. During Alan's last moments, he gives Chaton his earring and she seeks out other Chess Piece members and interrogates them on King's current location. After King is defeated, Chaton lives together with Alan and Babbo, who help take care of Loco. Her √ÑRMs include: * Bururu - A ring Guardian √ÑRM that summons a giant bulldog. * Cat Teaser - A ring Nature √ÑRM in the form of a cat-toy shaped which allows the user to play puppeteer with his/her opponent's body. * Nyan Nyan Wave - A ring Nature √ÑRM that creates a powerful blast. * Para Claw - A ring Weapon √ÑRM in the form of a powerful set of cat claws that paralyze the opponent. =Hamelin= („Éè„É°„É´„É≥ Hamerin) Hamelin is one of the top three most powerful bishops. He faces off against Alviss in the fifth round of the War Games. He lost when Alviss used his Sealing Skull on Hamelin's Guardian √ÑRM which immobilized both of them and then sent them flying with his 13 Totem Poles. Hamelin's √ÑRM consists of: * Bolino - A pendant Guardian √ÑRM that summons a giant monster with a bat-like face. * Charm Horn - A clarinet Weapon √ÑRM that makes copies of user. * Hyper Wing - Nature √ÑRM that places wings on its user. * Soul Flute - Weapon √ÑRM. It is a flute that saps the magical power of the user's opponent when he or she hears the music played on it. =Emokis= („Ç®„É¢„Ç≠„Çπ Emokisu) Emokis is one of the top three most powerful bishops and faces Princess Snow in the fifth round of the War Games. Emokis is very plump and thinks she is beautiful (she is also very sensitive about her appearance). In the end, Emokis is defeated by Snow. Her √ÑRMs include: * Dandalcia: A guardian √ÑRM that is in the shape of a sword and has a face that can speak. Emokis asks the √ÑRM if she is pretty which Dandalcia always says she is (although he is lying). In the end, an enraged Emokis destroys it when it finally admits that Snow is superior in looks. * Flower Fortune Bomb: When Emokis pulls off a petal after every time she asks, 'Is she ugly or not?', the target loses some hair in pain. After all of the petals are removed, an explosion triggers on the opponent. * House of Cake: When Emokis summons this √ÑRM, a giant candy house falls from the sky in which she eats. The more she eats, the bigger and more powerful she becomes. =Girom= („ÇÆ„É≠„É† Giromu) Girom is a psychotic boy about Ginta's age who enjoys killing, particularly women, much like his maniac older sister, the Knight Rapunzel. This is largely due to the tremendous stress from their childhood abuse from their mother, whom they later killed. He was present at Phantom's revival, along with the Knights and several other Chess Pieces. He and Orco attacked Vestry during the Chess Piece's war campaign, under the order to search for a certain √ÑRM. While searching the boat at the cave's end, he quickly meets up with and fights Ginta, who defeats him using Gargoyle. Girom was seen with Rapunzel observing the fight between Ginta and Garon. Girom then showed up in the 4th Round of the War Games, where he killed Aqua after her tie with Nanashi. As he wanted, Girom had a rematch with Ginta, and Girom almost won, due to Ginta's anger of him killing Aqua. Babbo later calmed Ginta down, however, and Ginta defeated Girom with Gargoyle, to which Girom also survived. He later witnessed his sister killed by Ian in battle as punishment for her killing of her teammates in the 4th Round. In a filler episode of the anime, he along with Kouga and Pinocchio attacked Ginta, Dorothy, and Alviss at the time Babbo was cracked. Ginta barely survived his battle with him. After being repelled, Diana sent them to kidnap the Kaldea Elder to which Ginta and Dorothy come to rescue him. He is last seen (also in the anime only) with the two somewhere riding Kung Fu Frog. Girum is a user of ice-based Nature √ÑRMs which consists of: * Argo- Thalos - A Guardian √ÑRM, summons a sphere-shaped chunk of ice that shoots energy beams at the enemy. He uses this when he attacks Caldia. It only appeared in the anime. * Crevasse - A ring Nature √ÑRM that creates a giant crevice beneath targets and plunges them through its endless depths. * Egola - A ring Guardian √ÑRM that summons an ice giant to attack the user's enemies. This giant's power increases in areas covered in ice. Destroyed by Gargoyle. * Iced Earth - A ring Nature √ÑRM and Girom's signature √ÑRM, used to fire shards of ice at the enemy. Some translations refer to this √ÑRM as Ice Doors, due to the Japanese pronunciation (Âáç„Çâ„Åï„Çå„ÅüÂú∞ÁêÉ ƒÄisudo Asu/ƒÄisu Doasu). =Garon= („Ç¨„É≠„É≥) Garon Rodokin is the Chess Piece who fought Ginta in the first round of the War Games and the father of Leno and Pano. He is an honorable man who is large and is always barefoot. During the first round of the War Games, Garon faced off against Ginta and gave him a hard time in battle. Ginta ends up sparing him (partly due to intervention by Pano) after Babbo's Gargoyle form broke his √ÑRM. He was killed by King, but was revived when King was defeated. He uses Nature √ÑRM which consists of: * Body Hardener - A Nature √ÑRM. It is a ring that hardens one's body. Garon has five of these. * Stronger Body - A Nature √ÑRM. It is a ring that enhances one's strength. Garon has five of these. =Kollekio= („Ç≥„É¨„ÉÉ„Ç≠„Ç™ Korekkio) Kollekio is a Bishop who resembles a goblin in a jester outfit. He fought Jack in the fourth round of the War Games and used his Magic Hammer to shrink Jack. Jack was able to defeat Kollekio by making his beans grow in Kollekio's body. Rapunzel did not take Kollekio's defeat lightly and challenged Kollekio to a game of Rock Paper Scissors. Kollekio lost and was slashed to death by Rapunzel. Kollekio's √ÑRM consists of: * Magic Hammer - A hammer Weapon √ÑRM that when it hits its targets, it will reduce their size to bean's size. * Slowpoke - A ring Darkness √ÑRM which can make someone unable to move with the side effect of the caster gaining temporary blindness. =Aqua= („Ç¢„ÇØ„Ç¢ Akua) Aqua is a pretty girl wearing a sea-themed ball dress. Despite being a Bishop of the Chess Pieces, the happy and rather unpredictable Aqua always keeps a smile on her face, much to the surprise of Team M√ÑR. Aqua refers to everyone with honorific suffixes in the Japanese version. Aqua appears in the 3rd round of the 4th Battle. After witnessing several examples of how Rapunzel kills any losing Chess Pieces, Nanashi and Aqua fight each other where Nanashi defeats Aqua with his Electric Eye. Nanashi however pretends that attack removed all of his energy in order to make the fight a draw in an attempt to save Aqua. Although Rapunzel isn't happy about this, Aqua wins Rock Paper Scissors against her. Despite that, Girom then impales Aqua as he sinisterly laughs \\"Too bad, I played rock.\\" Her final words were an apology to Nanashi. After Rapunzel was defeated by Dorothy, Nanashi floats her body into the water as a burial. She uses sea-themed √ÑRM which consists of: * Akko - A Guardian √ÑRM used by Aqua that summons a mobile giant clam. Unlike most Guardian √ÑRMs, Akko allows the user to still move while summoning it. * Skate - A Weapon √ÑRM (true name not stated in the series) that creates ice skates on the user's feet. She only used this once, drawing a target for Supikara. * Supikara - A crown Nature √ÑRM in the shape of a spiral seashell. By blowing in it, the user can call on sea creatures to aid in battle. Aqua wears Supikara on her head. NOTE: Her character is based on The Little Mermaid. =Avrute= („Ç¢„É¥„É´„Éº„Éà„Ç• Avur≈´tu) Avrute is a Bishop that has a jester-like appearance. He fought Dorothy in the fourth round of the War Games and was easily defeated. Rapunzel then kills him immediately for he is \\"too useless to even play rock paper scissors with.\\" Avrute's √ÑRM consists of: * Shelakey - A Weapon √ÑRM in the shape of a large clawed gauntlet. It can supposedly cut through anything even other √ÑRMs. Always spotted in activated form. =Kannochi= („Ç´„Éé„ÉÉ„ÉÅ Kanotchi) Kannochi is a Bishop who participates in the third round of the War Games where he had his nap until it was his turn. When it came to his turn, he faced off against Ginta. Kannochi uses Body Candle on Ginta which caused him to melt like a candle and even used his Dragon Rod to speed it up. Upon Ginta turning Babbo into Alice, Kannochi started to become affected by Body Candle and started to melt. Before melting fully, Kannochi gives Ginta some final words to encourage him to keep fighting, and warns him that from then on Team M√ÑR will be fighting the Knights, the true enemy. Ginta later encountered a fake version of Kannochi in a fake version of Tokyo. After a brief fight, the fake Kannochi disappeared when the rest of Team M√ÑR disappeared. Kannochi's √ÑRM consists of: * Body Candle - A Darkness √ÑRM that links the target's bodily status to a burning candle, causing them to melt down as it does until there is nothing left.

It only appeared in the anime. * Vaqua - A Guardian √ÑRM in the form of a giant blob of slime with one eye. The blob will digest anything it swallows up into its body (such as √ÑRM or even enemies themselves) and will regenerate from any damage. It is destroyed by Dorothy's Toto (although Dorothy was hoping to add it to her collection). =Mr. Hook= (Mr.„Éï„ÉÉ„ÇØ Fukku, \\"Captain Hook\\") Mr. Hook is a Bishop who partakes in the third round of the War Games. He faces off against Snow and has a better advantage on the Volcano Field. Mr. Hook defeats Snow, but doesn't kill her since Diana still wants her. In the fourth round, he faces off against Alviss who manages to defeat Mr. Hook without the use of any of his √ÑRMs. Rapunzel then has Mr. Hook play Rock Paper Scissors for the fate of his life. Mr. Hook loses and is slashed by Rapunzel as Mr. Hook's body falls through the ice. Mr. Hook's √ÑRM consists of: * Anger Anchor - A ring Weapon √ÑRM which summons a giant anchor from the sky to crush enemies. It is what he used to defeat Snow, but it did not hit Alviss. * Fishing Rod - A ring Weapon √ÑRM in the form of a fishing pole which can fling people up into the air. * Harpoon Cannon - A ring Weapon √ÑRM that summons a giant harpoon. * Screw Saber - The untwisted foil release of Mr. Hook's corkscrew-twisted bracelet Weapon √ÑRM. =Orco= („Ç™„É´„Ç≥ Oruko) Orco is a large barefoot Bishop who has a habit of underestimating his enemies. He was present at Phantom's revival. In the Chess Pieces' campaign for the War Games, Orco accompanied Girom in the attack on Vestry where he caused a lot of damages. Near the underground lake, Orco fought against Nanashi and Dorothy. Unfortunately for Orco, Nanashi easily defeats him when by pushing Orco into the water and using Electric Eye. Orco retreats and plans to return with more Chess Pieces only for him to run into Phantom (in his Tom disguise) who uses his Phantom Glass to kill Orco for showing his cowardice. Phantom then quotes for Orco to take his lessons from Ginta in the afterlife. * Body Hardener - A Nature √ÑRM. It is a set of armbands that can harden the user's body. Rooks („É´„Éº„ÇØ, R≈´ku) Rooks are the third strongest of the Chess Pieces after Bishops, they tend to be weak and more along the lines of above-average Pawns. Rook earrings are their insignia. =Loco= („É≠„Ç≥ Roko) Loco is the strongest of the Rooks and one of the first Chess Pieces introduced. Loco's name means a patron of healers in the religion of Voodoo, a reference to her √ÑRM Straw Doll (Spikes and Hammer). Loco was born 32 years before the main part of the series. At age 26, Loco, at that point a Pawn, the lowest Chess Piece rank, was given the order to participate in the attacking of an unknown town. While fighting, Loco's only √ÑRM the Weapon √ÑRM Ring Dagger, was broken, leaving Loco defenseless. While stumbling throughout the battling village, Loco crossed paths with a midget-like cloaked figure carrying a large suitcase. The cloaked person asked Loco if she wanted strength, to which she answered that she only wanted power to fight with. The cloaked person then gave Loco the suitcase, telling her it was full of seven Darkness √ÑRMs, the cost of using being reversed aging (similar to Monster Girl), and the mysterious figure died from the ARM's effects. Using the Darkness √ÑRMs, Loco eventually increased in the ranking system to the strongest of the Rooks. The Darkness √ÑRMs affects had damaged her, however, as her body had been transformed into a young child's by the series' beginning when she was 58 years old. Acting emotionless at all times, Loco finds little importance out of the happenings around her, and prefers to do anything that is seemingly the most successful path to take at the time. Loco's dark personality can also make her cruel at times. Unlike most other Chess Pieces, Loco does not wear her mask on her face (except at Phantom's revival), keeping it on her head's side instead. Loco is intelligent and wise, often being able to deduce problems quickly others find difficult or simply unsolvable. Loco also apparently doesn't enjoy sitting in the background doing nothing when given the chance to fight. Despite constantly being under her Darkness √ÑRMs' curse, Loco sees little significance of her reversed aging, instead taking more concern with outside matters. Despite her young appearance and rather emotionless cover, inside she is still a mature woman. Loco is also very good friends with Chaton of the Bishops, despite how Loco is easily annoyed by Chaton. Chaton still remains unaffected by Loco's coldness, however, or rather, doesn't seem to understand how Loco is annoyed by this. Loco appears has a crush on the high-ranking Knight Halloween, keeping with her a small doll of the powerful Knight, as seen in the anime.M√ÑR anime episode 73 Loco's appearance is often a common center of jokes throughout the series. Loco first appeared during Phantom's revival, and was later sent to kidnap Snow alongside Ian, though before they could succeed (or get killed by Alan), Halloween ordered them back to Lestava Castle. She later appears during the 2nd Round of the War Games and fights Nanashi, nearly killing him with her Darkness √ÑRM. Nanashi, however, breaks free and uses his Electric Eye to destroy the Darkness √ÑRM's affects, though losses because he is unwilling to harm her prior to his falling unconscious from exhaustion. In the manga Loco makes only background appearance after this, though in the anime Loco, and later Chaton as well, act as important allies to Team M√ÑR, helping them rescue the Princess of Reginlief and escape the Ghost Chess. During the fight with the Ghost Chess, however, Loco's consistent use of her Darkness √ÑRM ages her back into an infant, leading Chaton to take care of her. At the end of the series, Chaton and Alan, who now live together, take care of the baby Loco together. Loco keeps all of her √ÑRMs in the suitcase strapped on her back. Her √ÑRMs are: * Animal Change - A torc √ÑRM that metamorphoses people into animals which came into Loco's possession for a short period of time. It only appeared in the anime. * Negzero - A pendant Darkness √ÑRM that paralyzes the target, the side- effect is to reverse its user's aging. * Ring Dagger - A ring Weapon √ÑRM, transforms into a dagger. Loco had this √ÑRM during the First Great War, but it was broken just before she gained the Darkness √ÑRMs. * Straw Doll (Spikes and Hammer) - A Darkness √ÑRM in the shape of a straw man. Five metal stakes are hammered into ringed points on the straw man's body to damage the enemy in a Voodoo doll fashion. Using this √ÑRM causes the user to decrease in age. Additionally, Loco has five unknown Darkness √ÑRMs that she has never been shown using. It is unknown if using the Darkness √Ñrm causes permanent de- aging, though more likely an age decrease through every use. If that's the case, the cost is a benefit by possibly increasing life span. =Leno= („É¨„Éé Reno) Leno Rodokin is the son of Garon and Pano's brother, and the first enemy fought in the war games. He fought against Alviss who easily beat him. During Garon's battle with Ginta Toramizu, Leno believes it's all over once Garon's √ÑRM are destroyed. Pano, however, reveals the truth to Leno, much to his surprise, as Leno finally learns what really brings strength. He was killed by King (which left behind his mask). He was revived at the end watching Pano and Jack from afar with his father. Leno is a Nature √ÑRM user with his √ÑRMs consisting of * Flame Ball - A Nature √ÑRM that creates balls of fire that float around the user that can be launched as projectiles or used to strengthen weapon √ÑRM. * Storm Kadarm - A Weapon √ÑRM. It is a set of swords that attaches to the user's arms. These can act as both offensive and defensive weapons. =Pano= („Éë„Éé Pano) Pano Rodokin is the sister of Leno and the daughter of Garon who is always barefoot and has bandage wrappings on her upper right arm and her lower left leg. Pano's most notable trait is her relationship with Jack, who she falls in love with during the series. She defeats him in the first round of the War Games, though loses to him during their rematch in the third. In both of her battles with Jack, at some point Jack is comically hit in the groin by Pano. Using Jack's mushrooms, it's discovered she's scared of bats, being immobilized, leeches, and likes pretty flowers and butterflies. Pano first appeared with her family in the 1st Round of the War Games, where she managed to defeat Jack by hitting him in the groin with her Weapon √ÑRM. Jack and Pano have a rematch in the 3rd Round, where Jack uses his mushrooms to force Pano to surrender. While under the effect of the mushrooms, Pano sees an absurdly handsome vision of Jack, and is quick to fall in love with him followed by a hug. Once the illusion is removed, however, Pano quickly becomes angry at Jack and kicks him in a very bad place....hard. Pano later appeared during Jack's battle with Weasel, where she gave her support to Jack and encouraged him throughout the battle. By that time she seems to have developed a very big crush on Jack. In the anime, she later reappeared stealing food where she reunites with several members of Team M√ÑR, including Jack, where she reveals King's mass murder of several Chess Pieces, including her brother and father. After King is defeated, Pano lives with Jack and his mother on their farm together, and it appears that her family supports her relationship with Jack. Pano is a Weapon √ÑRM user with her √ÑRMs consisting of: * Ball Hammer - Pano's mace Weapon √ÑRM. Has a detachable ball head with radar skills to track down opponents and can separate into 4 sections to attack from different angles. =Alibaba= („Ç¢„É™„Éê„Éê Aribaba, \\"Ali Baba\\") Alibaba is a Rook in a turban. He fights Alan in the first match of the third round of the war games. Alibaba is easily defeated and is thought to be killed by Alan who drops him into a volcano for his bragging and stuck-up personality. Later on, Alibaba was actually saved by one of Phantom's √ÑRMs and later resurfaced to kidnap the Princess Reginlief with the help of Fugi. Alibaba is defeated again through the efforts of Ginta Toramizu, Jack, and Loco and is presumed to be dead. Once again, Alibaba turns up alive attending Carl and Princess Reginlief's wedding with Fugi. Alibaba's √ÑRM consist of: * Genie's Lamp - A Guardian √ÑRM in the shape of a lamp that releases a large green genie with a will of its own, that attacks with an apparent \\"mega punch\\". Alibaba claims that it is troublesome to control even for Knights, though this could be a retort on his part. This was destroyed by Alan. Alibaba later had another Genie's Lamp that contained a large red genie. =Fugi= („Éï„Éº„ÇÆ F≈´gi) A Rook who is the wind master. He is the first chess piece fought in round two where he fights Snow. He is defeated by her snowman Guardian √ÑRM Yuki when it crushes him, but he is left alive. Fugi later assisted Alibaba in kidnapping Princess Reginlief. By the end of the anime, Fugi watches the wedding of Carl and Princess Reginlief as he is surprased upon Alibaba turning up alive. Fugi's √ÑRM consist of: * Vindalva - Nature √ÑRM. Allows the user to control wind. =Garia= („Ç¨„É™„Ç¢) Garia is a Rook in the Chess Pieces who wears a knight helmet. Garia was seen earlier in the series as a background character when Phantom plans to begin the campaign of the Second War Games. He is among the Rooks that joins Phantom in the attack on Caldia. Garia was easily defeated by Ginta. Garia was among the Rooks who tried to prevent Team M√ÑR from reaching Snow. When Alan was killed by Caldia's Orb in the form of Danna, Chaton interrogated him about where Caldia's Orb is located. =Rondo= („É≠„É≥„Éâ) (English) Rondo is a Rook who wears a headband that covers his right eye. He was present on Phantom's attack of Caldia and lost fighting Ginta who used Babbo's Bubble Launcher on him. When Phantom arrived, he urged him to kill Ginta which Phantom declined at since he wanted to fight Ginta when he's at his best. =Bols= („Éú„É´„Çπ Borusu) (English) Bols is a Rook who dresses up in a costume that almost resembles a strange Yeti-like creature. He was present on Phantom's attack on Caldia and lost fighting Ginta who used Babbo's Bubble Launcher on him. Bols was one of the Rooks who tried to prevent Team M√ÑR from reaching Snow in their rescue mission inside Lestava castle. =Kalerin= („Ç´„É¨„É™„É≥ Karerin) Kalerin is a Rook who wears a strange mask decorated with geometric diamond. He was present on Phantom's attack of Caldia and lost fighting Ginta who used Babbo's Bubble Launcher on him.

Pawns („Éù„Éº„É≥, P≈çn) There are many Pawns in the Chess, and all but one (Gido) have not possessed individuality. Most are nameless and identical with black cloaks and masks. All Pawns are given a Weapon √ÑRM, either a spear or two-blades that are attached to the user's arms. =Gido= („ÇÆ„Éâ) Gido is Ian's girlfriend and the only Pawn of the Chess Pieces to have an individual identity. She accompanied Ian in his first battle against Ginta. When Ian is taken down, she holds her ground against the others until she is knocked down by Jack's attack. Due to Ian's loss to Ginta, Halloween had Ian punished by ordering Chimera to transform Gido into a creature with her body fused with tentacles, unable to speak as she transforms slowly into the hidieous creature. Eventually she is returned to her human form by Chimera's death and the couple leaves the Chess Pieces. In the anime afterwards, they meet up with Ash, who they quickly befriend, Ash dies protecting Ian and Gido from King, who return the favor by taking care of Ash's friends. Once Ash is revived, she and Ian continue to live with Ash and his kids. =Sub-Groups of the Chess Pieces=Zonnen The Zonnens are an anime exclusive group which consists of psychopaths and bloodlusters of the Chess Pieces. Years prior to the current War, when the Chess Pieces army was in its heyday of bloodshed, among those converged towards its banner there was a group. Alone in this line of psychopaths and bloodlusters its members stood out as outstanding examples of barbarity - they found joy in that era of chaos, indulged themselves in abominable acts of abduction, decimation and destruction; and beheld the sight of ravage as a thing of absolute beauty. Their bestiality was of such that even Phantom revolted at their very presence; and far from being promoted, the group was estranged from the official military force and sent on a permanent residence in distant quarters. With the fall of Phantom and the Chess Pieces the group also decamped to oblivion; no effort to capture them has been answered ever since. That group was the gang of the Planets that revolves around the Evil Sun, Zonnen. After 6 years of anticipation, Phantom has resurrected, the Chess Pieces has risen, and with that the Zonnens have also returned. Having already been prejudiced against Phantom's way, they soon get impatient with his monotonous War Games and attempt on the lives of team Team M√ÑR to resume their savour in the war's bloody cycle. They attacked Team M√ÑR while they were in Alan's Training Gate. =Saturn= The leader of the Zonnen and the most vicious of the bunch. He immobilized Alan with his Darkness √ÑRM Finsternis enabling the other Zonnen members to infiltrate the Training Gates. After the other Zonnen members were destroyed, Saturn attacked Alan as a last resort to trap the other members of Team M√ÑR. Alan had Merilo tell the others to transfer their power to Alan enabling Alan to break free. After Alan destroyed Finsternis, Saturn is metamorphosed into a one-horned wolf-like beast surrounded in a dark aura. Alan was able to open the Training Gates releasing Team M√ÑR. Saturn's beast form is then destroyed by the combined powers of Dorothy's Flying Leo, Snow's Yuki-chan, Alviss' 13 Totem Poles, Nanashi's Electric Eye, Jack's Earth Beans, and Ginta using Babbo's Gargoyle form.

If others step near the victim of this √ÑRM, they will be pushed back and possibly knocked out. The compensation for this √ÑRM is that when the √ÑRM is destroyed, he will be transformed into a one- horned wolf-like beast surrounded in a dark aura. =Mars and Mercury= : Mars : Mercury Members of the Zonnen that attacked Ginta and Jack. They were destroyed by Ginta's Gargoyle.

Ghost Chess The Ghost Chess are an anime exclusive group which consists of Chess members who use Ghost √ÑRMs. They appear in episode 85 to impede Team M√ÑR on their way to Phantom at Lestava castle. The leader, Kapel Meister transports Phantom to the distant fortress Pultgain and sends Team M√ÑR to a desert. During the subsequent fight with Ghost Chess member, Nanashi and Alan ends up being captured. Kapel Meister uses the Ghost √ÑRM Rondo of Time to speed up the Zombie Tattoo on Alviss causing him to pledge loyalty and affection to Phantom. After Team M√ÑR manage to regroup, they fight Alviss and successfully brings him back to his senses. In a final effort to destroy them, Kapel Meister assimilates his teammates with a Ghost √ÑRM and transforms himself into a monster, only to be defeated by Ginta. =Kapel Meister= Kapel Meister is the leader of the Ghost Chess. A Ghost √ÑRM fanatic and admirer of Phantom, he blames Team M√ÑR and Ginta for Phantom's current depressed state. He seeks the legendary √ÑRM of the sky castle Clavier in order to restore Phantom to his reign and usurps even the King and Queen. Using the Ghost √ÑRM \\"The Rondo of Time\\", he accelerates Alviss' Zombie Tattoo and presents a mindwashed Alviss to Phantom, much to Rolan's chagrin. He is eventually destroyed by Ginta after he fuses with all of the Ghost Chess, excluding Sarah, into a huge monster. Kapel's √ÑRM consists of: * Mekai No Analize - A Ghost √ÑRM that turns the user into a massive dragon-like beast with venomous fangs. * Rondo of Time - A pendant Ghost √ÑRM that accelerates a process of a victims body, such as the spreading of Alviss' Zombie Tattoo. =Sarah Band= Sarah Band is the female vice-captain of the Ghost Chess who is loyal to Kapel Meister. In the final fight with Team M√ÑR, she uses a Ghost √ÑRM with the ability to drain energy on them and ends up killing herself. Sarah's √ÑRM consists of: * Ark Torff - A Ghost √ÑRM turns the users hands into two bow-like constructs with demonic faces that absorb the magical power of enemies. If Ark Torff is countered, the user will rapidly age until they die. * Scythe Hand - An unnamed Ghost √ÑRM that turns the user's hands into scythe blades. * Gemul Essen - A flower-like Ghost √ÑRM pendant that is planted over the heart of a victim allowing the user to control their body. =The Flat Sisters= : Grave : Allegro : Moderato The Flat Sisters group of three sisters consisting of Grave, Allegro, and Moderato. Also extremely loyal to Kapel Meister, they even refer to him as 'big brother'. They die when assimilated by Kapel's Ghost √ÑRM, which transforms him into a monster. The Flat Sisters' √ÑRMs consist of: * Mess - A Ghost √ÑRM that turns the user's hand into a sword blade. * Rotk√§ppchen Waltzer - A Ghost √ÑRM that combines A, B and C into a large Red Riding Hood-like guardian that uses physical and energy attacks.

General dies when he is assimilated by Kapel Meister's Ghost √ÑRM. General's √ÑRM consists of: * Gegenzetsu - A Ghost √ÑRM that turns one of the users forearms into an axe-like weapon. Depending on which side Verfile lands on, it can gain fire attributes. =Pause= Pause is a midget who accompanies General and acts the spokesperson for both. Pause dies when assimilated by Kapel Meister's Ghost √ÑRM. Pause's √ÑRM consists of: * Verfile - A Ghost √ÑRM large dice that determines the form of Gegenzetsu when cast. Other characters=Humans=Danna Toramizu (ËôéÊ∞¥„ÉÄ„É≥„Éä, Toramizu Danna) Commonly known as \\"Boss\\", Danna is Ginta's father and the leader of the Cross Guard during the first War Games. Danna was obsessed with a \\"fantasy world\\" while in the human world, which he would later be taken into, and is both courageous and a role-model, though he is also very stubborn. All of these traits are shared by his son, and it is commented upon several times in the series their remarkable resemblance. He defeated Phantom in the Final Round of the original War Games, but was fatally wounded in the process. His body was later taken into usage by the King, and his soul was moved into Babbo. When the King is defeated, Ginta transfers his father's soul back into his body, and Danna is resurrected. At the end of the anime and manga, he leaves to return with his son Ginta to Earth world and his waiting wife. Koyuki Koyuki is Ginta's friend from Earth, who has often taken care of him. She is also Ginta's childhood friend, besides having a strong connection to Princess Snow. Not only does Koyuki look just like Snow, the two of them often see the each other's worlds through their dreams due to having a common soul. Koyuki uses her dreams to keep track of how Ginta is doing, and informs Mrs. Toramizu of Ginta's status in Mar. She also collects his schoolbooks and homework, and plans to make Ginta study hard when he gets back. As Snow's feelings towards Ginta grows, Koyuki shares Snow's romantic feelings as well, shown when she gets flustered and embarrassed when she tells Mrs Toramizu that Snow accidentally kisses Ginta. At the end of the series, Koyuki confronts her own feelings and clings onto Ginta upon his return to Earth under the falling snow. Mrs. Toramizu Mrs. Toramizu is Ginta's unnamed mom, who is an author of fantasy stories (which her missing husband and son are extremely interested in). Ginta's mother is a strong drinker and smoker, and also apparently has an interest in cooking unusual foods, once trying to make \\"pizza curry\\".M√ÑR manga volume 1, chapter 6, page 6 In spite of her occupation, she stands a very practical viewpoint in matters regarding fantasized subjects, therefore tends to make light of her husband's, and later, her son's, passion for such. After Ginta's disappearance, however, she rues this dearly, thinking it was her fault that her family's gone and as Koyuki narrates Ginta's journey in M√ÑR-Heaven, she starts viewing fantasized subjects in a different perspective. It is later revealed that Diana watched Ginta's world through his mother's eyes in a manner similar to Snow with Koyuki. She is reunited with her husband Danna when he returns with Ginta. Jack's Mom The unnamed wife of the Cross Guard soldier Jake and mother of Jack. She resides on a small farm with her son and later the Rogelu Brothers. Jack is very close to her heart, especially after Jake was killed by the knight Weasel in the first War Games, and she at first discourages him to get in any fights with any opponent who may try to kill him, even if facing them is the right thing to do (when the werewolves were terrorizing their farm, she happily tolerated their cruel gorging for fear that Jack would get hurt if they tried to stand up for themselves). However, after Jack's triumph over the werewolves, and later during Jack's first match in the War Games she realizes that the time has come for Jack to become a man and that she should support him in this. One of her regrets is that while she taught Jack everything she knew about farming, she never taught him the proper way to treat a lady, and Jack is thus a little bit of a pervert. Jack's mother also takes Pano in hand and considers her like a daughter (or more like a daughter- in-law, as a wife for her son). Jake Father of Jack and a disciple of Gaira. In the previous War, heeding Gaira's summon, Jake left his family and went join the Cross Guard. During a fight in the War Game, he was killed by Weasel and his Battle Shovel was given to Jack. Alma Alma is a dead Vestrian female sailor whose ghost haunts Vestry's cave with her fellow crew, and also the only one among them to actually possess the ability of materialization into a ghostly human form. Around 4 years before the 1st M√ÑR- Heaven war, Alma became Phantom's sweetheart until Phantom took on the Zombie Tattoo from his Queen, Diana. An argument soon broke out between the two, and as Alma realized she (and her viewpoint of life and humankind in general) couldn't shake his steadfast belief in the magnificence of immortality in the least, she bade Phantom farewell, never again met him.Japanese episode, episode 79 Alma and the crew of her ship died in the 1st War and, by the King of Chess Pieces himself, cursed to be wandering ghosts sealed inside the cave (in which approximately 2 years before she'd departed with Phantom) along with the Holy √ÑRM Purific Ave it hid. 6 years later at the prelude of the 2nd War Game, Ginta's group arrived at Vestry and ventured into the cave to defeat the two Chess Bishops responsible for rampaging Vestry, Orco and Girom. Heeding their beg for freedom, after defeating Girom, Ginta cleared the blocked end of the cave, opening the way for the ship to depart. As a token of gratitude (and also in a hope to stop PhantomM√ÑR manga volume 15, chapter 152, page 9), Alma gave him one magic stone and the Purific Ave and ascended to heaven. Alma made a reappearance exclusive to the anime in the Ghost Chess attack, transporting Ginta and Dorothy back to Phantom's fortress after they were expelled out of there to her cave by the Ghost Chess. After the attack, she also appeared before Phantom and by assuring him he was not at all unloved, helped his soul achieve salvation before he died. John Peach John Peach is a boy with bandaged feet who fancies himself as the future great hero of M√ÑR, quite ignorant of his dim-witted and cowardly nature. He has a backpack of √ÑRMs that are either too hard for him to use, very weak or do not work right. Hearing about the Chess raid in Vestry, he appeared there just after Ginta defeated Girom and challenged the boy for Team M√ÑR's leadership, which he lost miserably (as during each contest, just about every √ÑRM he used backfired on him). When a group of thieves he had defeated (which was due to sheer dumb luck, since the Demon Tarantula √ÑRM they used turned on them instead of him) appeared to take revenge on John Peach, he activated Demon Tarantula, only to had himself and his three friends nearly devoured by it, had it not been for Ginta's help. John Peach left before the Second War Games begun, and returned for once to cheer for M√ÑR in the Final Battles. He's seen at the end of the anime training with his three friends as he meditates under a waterfall. Gaira The 3rd man who fought in the 1st War Game 6 years ago alongside Danna and Alan, earning the Cross Guard their victory. He, however, loses to the Knight Chimera in the preliminary of the 2nd, and since then aids M√ÑR by training its inexperienced members. At the end of the anime, he was last seen attending the wedding of the Princess of Reginlief and Carl. Princess Reginlief Princess Reginlief is the host of the War Games. Fearing for her people's lives, she accedes to abiding by the Chess Pieces' willsM√ÑR manga volume 5, chapter 42, page 9 and takes charges of the Games' preliminary round, later on in the first four rounds of casting the die to decide number of participants and battle locations. For this, Snow looks up to her as an inspirational figure of how the ruler must care for her subjects. She is revealed to have a secret relationship with one of her soldiers, Carl, after he proves his manliness during Princess Reginlief's kidnap in the dungeon of Reginlief Castle, instigated by Alibaba and Fugi under orders from Phantom. During the ending credits of the last episode, she and Carl, with several other guests attending, were seen getting married. Though their wedding was secretly watched by Fugi and Alibaba. Caldia's Grand Elder Caldia's Grand Elder is the most prominent figure of Caldia authority, always residing in the island's floating palace. As the elder he's ruthless when it comes to upholding Caldia's laws, having no apparent remorse when ordering family members to kill each other for the sake of redressing broken laws: 20 years ago it was he who urged Phantom's parents to execute their only son for having (almost) stolen the Orb, and it was also he who dispatched Dorothy to her one remaining relative, the older sister Diana's assassination for having absconded from Caldia with 798 of their √ÑRMs. However, in cases when it's in Caldia's interest, he can be very resourceful and of great help: to aid team M√ÑR in their war against the Chess (which was, in particular, commanded by two of Caldia's outlaws Diana and Phantom and therefore part of the responsibility goes to Caldia), he's given them powerful Guardian √ÑRMs and as the Final Battles concludes, appears before them to teach Ginta the true power of Purific Ave (which was to dispel Phantom's Zombie curse, ending his immortality). In the anime when King and Queen attack Caldia's floating castle, he's morphed into a slimy giant and petrified when the curse is lifted by Babbo's Alice form. As King dies, everyone killed by him is revived, including the elder and he's seen talking to Caldian children in the ending credits. Kotomi Tachibana Kotomi Tachibana is Ginta and Koyuki's mutual childhood friend who died of an incurable medical condition while she was playing hide and seek with her friends. Ginta blamed himself for not being able to save Kotomi's life, as he believed that things would have panned out differently had he found her earlier. Ginta also tried his best to forget about Kotomi after she died which he eventually succeeds only to be reminded of this dark memory during his journey in the Earth fabricated from Ginta's memories. =Other creatures=Belle Belle is a tiny fairy seen most of the times at Alviss' side. Belle befriended Alviss in his earlier years while he was training under Gaira's supervision and from then on has cherished a passion for him, which borders on monopolising crush: she cares for him a great deal, and gets jealous of whomever Alviss so much as behaves intimately to (which ranges from girls to friends, e.g. Alan). Belle and Edward host extras at the end of each episode that sums up the plot of each episode and lists the √ÑRM Chess Pieces use in that episode. In the end of the anime, Alviss and Belle live happily ever after. NOTE: She is named after Tinkerbell from Peter Pan. Rogelu Brothers : Garu Rogelu : Ruga Rogelu The Rogelu Brothers are two vegetarian werewolves that often steal vegetables from the garden of Jack's Mom. In the past, they have been thwarted by Jack's father Jake. The Rogelu Brothers were eventually defeated by Ginta and Jack. During the events of the War Games, the Rogelu Brothers made amends with Jack's Mom and help her out with the farming in exchange for vegetables. Edward Edward is a cowardly humanoid dog who is Princess Snow's companion. After Alan fought to a draw against Halloween in the First War Games, Halloween used the Darkness √ÑRM Igniel to merge Alan with Edward so that when Edward fell asleep three times, he would become Alan. But if Alan fell asleep just once, he would revert to Edward. They were later separated by Babbo's Alice form. Of course Edward's fear of cats would also carry over to Alan. * Flying Carpet - A Dimension √ÑRM that takes the form of a flying carpet. It often serves as a mode of transportation. Burube, Torobe, and Garobe Burube Torobe Garobe Burube, Torobe, and Garobe are three small creatures who are John Peach's companions who care very much for his safety. Burube is a small eggplant-shaped creature who carries on his back a book that details every known √ÑRM, Torobe is a small red creature, and Garobe is a pink gelatinous creature that wears a witch's hat. Pozun Pozun is a small purple dwarf-like creature with a long tail. He is the judge of the War Games and is also in charge of explaining the rules as well as announcing when the War Games matches take place. He is hired by Chess, and has been the judge ever since the first War Games took place. After the War Games are over, Pozun gives Team Mar the Andata to Lestava Castle after Jack solves Pozun's village's water problems. At the end of the anime, he is seen playing with his dwarf friends in a hot spring. Porin Porin is Pozun's younger sister. Appearing in M√ÑR Omega * Kai: An √ÑRMsmith's fosterling who admires Ginta for his deeds in the 2nd M√ÑR-Heaven war. He always wants an √ÑRM as powerful as Babbo, but is incapable of using any, as commented by his foster father, for his character is too hesitant. It later turns out Kai has very strong magical power, suggestive of his ancestral relation to the wizards. It is later revealed that he is a descendant of Babbo, which makes him able to wield Babbo. In reality, he is Babbo's son having been revived and sent to the future at the end of the war between Unwetter and Babbo. * Babbo: The legendary √ÑRM in the first two M√ÑR-Heaven wars, wielded by captain of M√ÑR, Ginta. Ever since the 2nd war concluded, he has been traveling around searching for Ginta, and ended up sleeping in a lake until Kai wakes him up. Babbo has no magic stone inserted, so he cannot transform into his previous versions. However, Babbo has new versions:  Version 1 - \\"Needle Work\\": A centaur with a lance.  Version 2 - \\"Hornet\\": A hornet that can separate to three parts.  Version 3 - \\"Karadrio\\": A harpy that has healing powers.  Version 4 - \\"Baron\\": A human type wearing an Oni mask. Does unarmed combat.  Version 5 - \\"Behemoth\\": A hippopotamus that can swallow everything.  Version 6 - \\"Nord Tortue\\": An absolute-defense turtle.  Version 7 - \\"The Snow Queen\\": A Snow Queen.  Version 8 - \\"Omega Gargoyle\\": Babbo's old Version 3 - Gargoyle that combines with Omega System. * Elise: Kai's friend and also one of the sole escapees after the fake √ÑRM user's attack on Kai's village, besides Kai himself. She's a cheerful, sweet girl, and promises to protect Kai in times of danger. It has currently been revealed that Dorothy had given her the nature ARM Fiori. The ARM contains the elements wind, fire, ice, and lightning. This ARM does not seem to have to much power to it, but according to Dorothy Elise's magic span should be enough to maintain it. * Leon: Kai's friend, but one always has a bone to pick with the other, either by Leon teasing Kai for not having an √ÑRM, or claiming himself to be stronger than Ginta, Kai's hero. * Greda: A girl that lost her village, just like Kai. She was one of Artemis's underlings and killed by Artemis himself. * Inga: Full name Inga Reed Unwetter, this young wizard boy is the descendant of Unwetter. One of his ARMs is a giant scythe-type weapon.

Silk cocoons and nests often resemble paper or cloth, and their use has arisen independently in many societies. Background Silk taken from various species has been used since ancient times, either in its natural state or after some form of preparation. Spider webs were used as a wound dressing in ancient Greece and Rome, and as a base for painting from the 16th century. Caterpillar nests were cut and pasted together to make a paper-like fabric in the Aztec Empire. To make a woven fabric, silk threads must first be either carded and spun, or extracted as a single intact thread. Commercially reared silkworms of the species Bombyx mori (Linnaeus, 1758) are normally killed before the pupae emerge, either by pricking them with a needle or dipping the cocoons into boiling water, thus allowing the whole cocoon to be unravelled as one continuous thread. This allows a much finer cloth to be woven from the silk. There are more than 500 species of wild silkworms in the world, although only a few are used to produce cloth. They usually produce a tougher and rougher silk than that from domesticated B. mori. Wild silks are usually harvested after the moths have left the cocoons, cutting the threads in the process, so that there is not one long thread, as with domesticated silkworms. Wild silks are more difficult to bleach and dye than silk from Bombyx mori, but most have naturally attractive colours, particularly the rich golden sheen of the silk produced by the muga silkworm from Assam, often known as Assam silk. The cocoon shells of wild silk moths are toughened or stabilized either by tanning (cross-linking) or by mineral reinforcements (e.g. calcium oxalate). Recently, a new method has been developed, demineralizing, which can remove the mineral reinforcements present in wild silks and enables wet reeling like the commercial silkworm. Wild silk industry in India Wild silks are often referred to in India as 'Vanya' silks: > The term 'Vanya' is of Sanskrit origin, meaning untamed, wild, or forest- > based. Muga, Tasar, and Eri silkworms are not fully tamed and the world > calls the silks they produce as 'wild silks'.\\"The Wonders Of India‚Äôs > 'Vanya'Silks‚Ä¶\\" > India produces four kinds of silk: mulberry, tasar, muga and eri. The > silkworm Bombyx mori is fed on mulberry leaves cultivated in plantations. > Silkworms are also found wild on forest trees, e.g Antheraea paphia which > produces the tasar silk (Tussah). Antheraea paphia feeds on several trees > such as Anogeissus latifolia, Terminalia tomentosa, T. arjuna (Terminalia > arjuna), Lagerstroemia parviflora and Madhuca indica. Wild silkworm > Antheraea assamensis produces muga silk, and another wild silkworm > Philosamia synthia ricini (= Samia cynthia) produces eri silk. The estimated > annual production of tasar silk is 130 tonnes. Production of other types of > silk exceeds 10 000 tonnes (Gupta 1994). In 2015, Adarsh Gupta K of Nagaraju's research team at Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India, discovered the complete sequence and the protein structure of Muga Silk Fibroin and published it in Scientific Reports. The eri silk worm from India feeds on the leaves of the castor plant. It is the only completely domesticated silkworm other than Bombyx mori. The silk is extremely durable, but cannot be easily reeled off the cocoon and is thus spun like cotton or wool.\\"The Queen of Textiles.\\" Nina Hyde. National Geographic Magazine. Vol. 165, No. 1, January, 1984, pp. 2-49. Wild silk industry in China Some of the best quality wild silk is produced by silkworms in Henan. This is the only type of wild silk that can be easily dyed. History of wild silk Wild silk threads have been found and identified from two Indus River sites, Harappa and Chanhu-daro, dating to c. 2450‚Äì2000 BCE. This is roughly the same period as the earliest evidence of silk use in China, which is generally thought to have had the oldest silk industry in the world. The specimens of threads from Harappa appear on scanning electron microscope analysis to be from two different species of silk moth, Antheraea mylitta and A. assamensis, while the silk from Chanhu-daro may be from a Philosamia species, (eri silk), and this silk appears to have been reeled.\\"New Evidence for Early Silk in the Indus Civilization.\\" I.

In 1980, an area of 13,000 ha was designated a UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserve. Ski resort  At 4.25 square kilometres (1.64 sq mi), Shiga-k≈çgen is arguably the largest ski resort in Japan, as well as the second highest in elevation. The resort is made up of 21 smaller, interconnected ski fields, with 70 lifts in total. Starting in winter 2015-16 all of Shiga-k≈çgen became open to skiers and snowboarders (previously some areas were restricted to skiers only). The resort was the site of several events in the 1998 Nagano Olympics. There are more than 100 hotels in the area, with Japanese style or washitsu (ÂíåÂÆ§), Western style or semi-Japanese style rooms. = Ski season = Shiga-k≈çgen has one of the longest ski seasons in Japan with the official ski season commencing from mid-to-late November and continuing throughout April and until Golden Week, the first week of May. Christmas and the New Year's season is the peak period in Shiga-k≈çgen during the Japanese school holiday break. From April 1 onward, the spring ski season begins with lift ticket discounts offered and the Maruike, Hasuike, and Sunvalley ski areas cease operation. = Transportation = During the ski season, the free Shiga-k≈çgen Ski Shuttle Bus is provided for transportation across the ski resorts and various ski fields and hotel areas. The buses are usually quite punctual to the minute but this can vary with the weather conditions so it is recommended that guests take an earlier bus where possible. During the season, the shuttle bus between resorts operates Monday to Sunday unless there is a severe snow or other weather warning, which can often see services terminate early. There are also buses that travel to and from Nagano station and Iiyama Station to both Shiga-k≈çgen and Yudanaka. Several convenient car parks are also available near the resorts for those who are travelling with their own vehicle. = Driving conditions = During the winter season, the road leading to Shiga-k≈çgen is often wet and icy and roads into resorts are often covered with snow. The road is steep and rough, and flanked by larger dropoffs. Snow tires are mandatory, and four wheel drive is recommended. = Convenience stores and groceries = Shiga- k≈çgen does not have any supermarkets or major grocery stores. There are a few small convenience stores mostly located inside hotels including the Hotel Shiga Sunvalley. There are larger stores (part of a chain of convenience stores called \\"Yamakazi Store\\") inside Hotel Japan Shiga, Olympic Hotel and Villa Ichinose which has bread, other baked goods, sandwiches, cold beverages, beer, sake and other alcoholic beverages, chocolate, biscuits, ice-cream, band-aids and sports tape. At the Yokoteyama area, there's Yamazaki Store inside Shiga Palace Hotel. It is also complete with the usual goods with the addition of stuff for daily necessities, personal hygiene, souvenir items, Shiga Kogen local beers, wine and sake and vending machines for beers, softdrinks and ice cream.  Onsen hot springs  Shiga-k≈çgen was famous as an onsen (hot spring) location before skiing became popular. Shiga-k≈çgen ski resort is home to over seven natural hot spring sources. Many hotels are sourced by the Shiga Mountain hot springs and there are numerous onsen bath facilities located within the hotels across the resort.  Other activities  Shirakaba or Japanese white birch (Betula platyphylla var. japonica), on the left, and dakekamba or Erman's birch (Betula ermanii), on the right. Two typical Shiga-k≈çgen's trees According to the book National Parks of Japan, published by Natural Parks Foundation: > \\"Shiga-k≈çgen has more than 40 lakes and ponds\\" and \\"Joshinetsu National Park > is a habitat for Japanese Macaques and Japanese Serows. \\"Also, \\"the > vegetation in the park area changes as the altitude becomes higher, from > beech (Fagus crenata) and Japanese oak (Quercus crispula) woods to > coniferous forests. In many mountains, communities of alpine plants can be > seen. Woods of Japanese larches (Larix kaempferi) and White Birches (Betula > platyphylla var. japonica) which cover the plateaus are especially > beautiful.\\" All these characteristics made Shiga-k≈çgen an interesting spot to hiking and enjoy the nature all seasons of the year. It is possible to fish in Shiga- k≈çgen at Maru-ike (Maru Pond) and Biwa-ike (Biwa Pond). You can also fish at Zako River, with a fishing license. Zako River is one of a few habitats for iwana fishing. Fishing is prohibited from October 1 till April 5. Boats are also available for rent at Biwa Pond, Maru Pond, and Kido Pond. Some of the other activities in the area include golfing at Ogushiga, horse riding at Maru Pond, bicycles for rent at Okushiga, and numerous tennis courts in the Yakebitai and Okushiga Area.  Sightseeing  Yokoteyama's Bakery - Shiga- k≈çgen, 2009 Unj≈ç no Yado Yokote Sanch≈ç Hyutte (mountain hut) is a restaurant, bakery, and hotel. Located at 2305m above sea level, the bakery claims to be the highest in Japan. The Nagano Prefecture Shiga Kogen Nature Preservation Center is housed in Shiga Kogen Sogo Kaikan 98. The main focus is the \\"Relationship between Nature and Human Being\\", which exhibits the nature of Shiga-k≈çgen. The Commemorative Hall of the Nagano Winter Olympics and Paralympic in 1998 is located in the Hasu-ike area. Medals and other memorabilia are displayed. The Higashitateyama Botanical Garden is located on top of Mt. Higashitate (2,020m), and includes nature trails. The Shinshu University Scientific Research Institute is located in the forest surrounding Mt. Shiga. The lava-based soil in the area makes it a rare area in the world. A Nature Observation Trail is opened to the public.

A typical arrangement has the engines mounted on the wingtips, in which the entire propulsion system is rotated from axial to dorsal in order to achieve the transition from hover or vertical flight to horizontal. Aircraft of such a configuration are fully capable of performing VTOL operations, akin to a helicopter, as well as conducting high speed flights. However, the configuration has been restrained to experimental aircraft only, as other configurations for VTOL aircraft have been pursued instead. History During the 1950s, rapid advances in the field of jet propulsion, particularly in terms of increased thrust and compact engine units, had contributed to an increased belief in the technical viability of vertical takeoff/landing (VTOL) aircraft, particularly within Western Europe and the United States.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 451-454. During 1950s and 1960s, multiple programmes in Britain, France, and the United States were initiated; likewise, aviation companies inside West Germany were keen not to be left out of this emerging technology. Shortly after 1957, the year in which the post-Second World War ban upon West Germany operating and developing combat aircraft was lifted, German aviation firms Dornier Flugzeugwerke, Heinkel, and Messerschmitt, having also been allowed to resume their own activities that same year, received an official request from the German Federal Government that urged them to perform investigative work on the topic of VTOL aircraft and to produce concept designs.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 451-452. Artist's concept of the Bell XF-109 in flight, Around the same period, the American aviation company Bell Aircraft were investigating their own designs for VTOL performance. One proposal was the Bell D-188A, which was envisioned as a supersonic tiltjet fighter; however, it never progressed beyond the mockup stage. Another tiltjet platform designed by the company was the Bell 65 \\"Air Test Vehicle\\". Intended purely for experimental purposes, this one-of-a- kind aircraft made extensive use of existing general aviation components throughout to reduce its cost. Having performed its first hover on 16 November 1954, work with the Bell 65 was halted during the following year in favour of more advanced VTOL designs.\\"Bell 65 Air Test Vehicle (ATV)\\" V/STOL Wheel (2009) vstol.orgBell ATV (Air Test Vehicle), 1954 the Aviation History Online Museum In West Germany, interest in developing a VTOL fighter aircraft had resulted in the development of the EWR VJ 101, a supersonic-capable VTOL tiltjet that entered flight testing during the 1960s. Its propulsion system, consisting of multiple Rolls-Royce RB145, a lightweight single-spool turbojet engine was developed as a collaborative effort between the British engine specialist Rolls-Royce Limited and the German engine manufacturer MAN Turbo.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 452-453. Its control systems, developed by American firm Honeywell and Germany company Bodenseewerk, performed various functions across the flight regime of the VJ 101 C, including attitude control during hover and the transition from hover to horizontal aerodynamic flight.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 514-515. The first prototype's maiden hovering flight on 10 April 1963.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 454. However, the programme was restructured from being producing a successor to the German Air Force's fleet of Lockheed F-104 Starfighters to a broader research and development programme, aimed at exploring and validating the VJ 101's flight control concepts.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 514. Akin to the fortunes of the tiltjets, various other projects of the era to develop supersonic-capable VTOL fighter aircraft, including the Mirage IIIV and the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 (a supersonic parallel to what would become the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, a subsonic VTOL combat aircraft that reached operational service), ultimately met similar fates. The Harrier jump jet and, substantially later, the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, has since demonstrated the potential of VTOL fighters.

Early years Her father's name was Tojiboy () and her mother's name was Uljon (). She had a younger brother. Yusupova worked at the family farm since she was 9 years old. She married in 1898, and had two children with her husband, who died in 1940. \\"During World War I, I had already had two children,\\" she said. \\"I experienced the burden of those times. I remember it very well, and the period of collectivization. What can I say, our people suffered greatly ... But I have never been afraid of difficulties.

The school organises a three-day Interart, the \\"Vikram Sarabhai International Arts Festival\\" at Ahmedabad, every year. It celebrated its golden jubilee on 28 December 1998, with the announcement of the annual \\"Mrinalini Sarabhai Award for Classical Excellence\\", in the field of classical dance. Naming While \\"darpana\\" is the Hindi word for \\"mirror\\", the use here also references the \\"Abhinaya Darpana\\", \\"The Mirror of Gestures\\", Nandikeshvara's ancient text upon Indian stage-craft and dance. History Founder of Darpana Academy Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and Mrinalini Sarabhai The Darpana Academy of Performing Arts was founded in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India by Vikram Sarabhai and his wife Mrinalini Sarabhai. The work in using arts foe social change began at Darpana in the 1960s. Darpana‚Äôs puppeteers started working with the central ministry of rural development in teaching village women the use of smokeless stove. The theatre department then run by Kailash Pandya created a play called Ma to rally people to the war effort. Mrinalini Sarabhai, in a radical departure from the spiritual core of the classical Bharat Natyam used the style to talk of the horror of dowry violence. Over the years two departments were established to focus the work of using the arts for change. Darpana for Dvelopment in 1980, today run by actor activist Jignesh Patel, and Darpana Communication in 2001 run by film maker Yadavan Chandran. In addition, in 2009 CRANTI (Citizens Resource and Action Initiative) was formed to give practical guidance to citizen to use the laws and tools available to them to fight their own battles, and to train people in the use of the Right To Information Act to solve daily problems of access and justice, run by Bharatsinh Jhala. During the last three decades, these departments have worked on over 51 projects all over India, reaching out to over 12.5 million people. The work has been in areas ranging from public health, women‚Äôs empowerment, gender issues and education to the environment, human rights, communal harmony, good governance, citizen‚Äôs participation in democracy, race, gender and disability. Through the use of television and film, theatrical and street performances, quizzes and debates, puppets and board games. They have been able to effectively talk about a range of sensitive issues from women and violence, to religious intolerance, the environment, human rights, corruption and justice. The academy received UNESCO sponsorship to offer Artist Residency programs in 1999-2000 and 2005-2007. The academy was also listed by UNESCO an institution active in the \\"Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage\\", and thereby invited to attend the subsequent Intergovernmental Committee meetings. In 1962, Achyut Kanvinde was commissioned by Sarabhai to design the building of the academy. Activities dance academy The academy offers courses in Indian classical dance Bharatanatyam, Indian Classical Vocal, Mridangam, Violin and Flute, puppetry and martial art Kalaripayattu. Its departments range from performance and teaching of the arts, to the use of performance and arts as development communication, through face-to-face impact and software production. The Drama Section, under acting duo Kailash Pandya and Damini Mehta, is responsible for more than 100 productions of a wide variety. Darpana attracted young writers and staged their first scripts, making them an integral part of production efforts. Some of the names can be mentioned as Madhu Rye, Labhshankar Thakar, Shrikant Shah, Subhash Shah, Chinu Modi, and Hasmukh Baradi. It also conducted theatre-training courses for over two decades. Its research wing, Janvak, published monographs like Goverdhan Panchal's on Bhavai.

He is widely regarded as the first British decathlete to achieve world class performances in this event. He won the AAA Championships on three occasions, finished second in the 1970 Commonwealth Games, was sixth in the European Championships, and twice competed in the Olympic Games. He improved the British Decathlon record four times, two of these were also Commonwealth Records, bringing it close to the 8,000 points mark. At an unofficial meeting at Alan Hancock College, Santa Maria, California in May 1972 he became the first British decathlete to score over 8,000 points in a decathlon though the circumstances of this performance invalidated it for record purposes.Athletics Weekly, (AW26.24.35) He was a Naval Air Mechanic in the Royal Navy, and married to Angela D Gabbett. During his athletic career he made his home in Portsmouth, England. On retiring from the Fleet Air Arm he established a career in shipping and forwarding and now has an Independent Financial Advisory consultancy and now resides in Buckinghamshire. Early years Gabbett was born in Watlington, Oxfordshire. He was educated at the Royal Alexandra and Albert School, in Surrey, a residential school with a reputation for sporting endeavour, graduating in 1957. In October 2005 Gabbett was guest of honour and principal speaker at a ceremony at the school to celebrate its conversion to a specialist Sports College. Gabbett joined the Royal Navy as a Naval Air Mechanic and although sport would have formed a significant part of his training there is no record of any athletic performance until May 1960 when he finished third in a high jump competition in Portsmouth, he has since said that Athletics was his main focus and passion. By 1963 he had added sprinting to his repertoire and finished second in the Royal Navy Championship at both 100m and 200m events. Less than a month later he went one better in winning both events at the Inter Services Championships, running 10.9s for the 100m into a headwind of ‚àí0.75 m/s. The following year (1964) he confined himself to a limited program due to competing in the Field Gun competition at the Royal Tournament, but in 1966 he started to explore his potential as a multi-event athlete by taking medals in three events at the Royal Navy Championships in Plymouth. He was at this time just \\"one of many\\" 9.9s sprinters (for 100 yards) when he decided to switch to the decathlon, which Mel Watman described as a \\"shrewd move\\". His first recorded decathlon was at the AAA Championships at Welwyn Garden City in July 1966, where he finished 5th (11.0 6.71 10.61 1.78 49.2 16.3 30.96 2.90 46.33 4:33.7) scoring 6,435 points placing him 7th in the British rankings for the year.Athletics Weekly, (AW22.33.4)Athletics Weekly, (AW20.29.17) This brought him to the attention of Tom McNab, who was at that time one of Britain's most respected and senior athletics coaches. International career In a 1971 interview with Dave Cocksedge, asked when he first got hooked on the decathlon, Gabbet said, \\"It was training under Tom McNab and getting inspired by him that helped the most. I began to see the possibilities for myself; realised I had a good top class decathlon in me if I worked hard enough for it.\\"Athletics Weekly, (AW25.47.21) Four decathlons in 1967 confirmed Gabbett's work ethic and enthusiasm. In May he competed twice in two weeks showing some improvement in the technical events if not the total score. In July he won the AAA Championship at Hurlingham (11.1 6.63 11.75 1.80 50.2 16.3 36.64 3.00 44.92 4:40.4) with a new personal best score of 6,533 points,Athletics Weekly, (AW21.30.10) and in September he went to Li√®ge in Belgium for his first international meet where he further improved his best in finishing fourth (11.0 7.10 9.27 1.83 49.7 16.2 34.14 3.00 48.62 4:36.2) with 6,562 points.Athletics Weekly, (AW21.37.28) 1968 was an Olympic year, so the target for Gabbett and McNab as they head into winter training is the Olympic qualifying mark of 7,200 points, the race for which turned into something of an adventure. Indoor marks of 7.1s for 60 metres and 8.6s for 60-metre hurdles are hardly sparkling by the standard of specialist sprinters, but were a new direction for UK decathletes. The outdoor season kicked off with an encouraging 7.20m long jump at Oxford in March, after which Gabbett suffered a stress-fracture in his foot. Then in July he went to Crystal Palace for his first decathlon of the season. A 10.8s 100m and a fine 7.35m long jump set up the first day nicely, and after a \\"fiery\\" 48.7s 400m in which he \\"demolished\\" 400-metre specialist John Hemery, Gabbett ended day one on 3,901 points, easily the best by a British athlete. Below par for the first two events on the next day, both Jim Smith and Dave Travis the javelin specialist closed in on Gabbett, but a determined personal best 3.40m in the pole vault put him not just back in the lead but back on schedule. A \\"pathetic\\" javelin throw of 42.91m ended hopes of achieving the Olympic qualifying mark, but all three leaders had hopes of achieving 7,000 points as they lined up for the final event. Travis tried gallantly but could not stay with the nimbler athlete and Gabbett's 5.7s lead at the tape was sufficient for his first National Record (10.8 7.35 11.78 1.83 48.7 15.7 35.91 3.40 42.91 4:25.2) of 7,082 points. Travis also passed 7,000 points and third placed Jim Smith was only 22 points shy of the mark. With two decathletes over 7,000 points, respected athletics journalist Mel Watman said that British decathlon had, \\"come of age\\".Athletics Weekly, (AW22.29.33) But 7,082 is not 7,200 and Mexico was still a long way off. The second-highest ranked decathlete in the world at that time was the American Bill Toomey, who was in London the following month (he married British Olympic athlete Mary Rand in 1969) and was persuaded to enter the AAA Decathlon Championship as a guest. Toomey, who had previously run 10.3s, was expected to leave Gabbett in arrears in the first event, particularly after the American got a \\"flying start\\", but Gabbett made up the handicap to share a time of 10.8s, (equalling his best). He came close to his best in the long jump, \\"slumped\\" in the shot (his weakest event), equalled his best (1.83m) in the high jump and in the chilly and damp evening of day one he held Toomey ‚Äì whose best was 2 seconds better than Gabbett's ‚Äì to half a yard in the 400m to record a personal best 48.5s. The first day brought 3,872 points (compared to 3,901 in his 7,082). Day two was warm and sunny and Gabbett kicked off with a best hurdles of 15.6s, \\"disappointed\\" in the discus but set a new personal best in the pole vault, \\"whipped out\\" another personal best in the javelin leaving him a target of 4:26.8 or better in the 1500 metres. Trevor Newey repeated his pacemaking from the previous month leading them through 400m in 69.6s with Gabbett on his shoulder. The 800m was passed in 2:21.4 and Gabbett took the lead at the bell. They passed 1200m in 3:33.6 and with just 200 metres to go Toomey \\"flashed\\" by in an attempt to make the 4:19.1 he needed for 8,000 points. Gabbett was not content to concede the lead and struck back in the home straight to win in a new personal best 4:20.2 having run the last lap in 64s. Toomey placed first with 7,985 points. As he was only a guest he could not be crowned the champion so Gabbett retained his AAA title, set a new AAA national record and got his Olympic qualifying mark (10.8 7.35 11.78 1.83 48.7 15.7 35.91 3.40 42.91 4:25.2) with 7,247 points. Clive Longe was selected along with Gabbett for the decathlon at the Mexico Olympics, but they didn't fly out together. James Coote said that for Gabbett, \\"...this was a disastrous Olympics. First he missed the plane which should have taken him out to Mexico, and then, when long jumping out on the village training track, he managed to pull a hamstring muscle. It improved to the extent that he actually entered but the muscle went again just before the start and he was forced to withdraw, leaving Longe to suffer on his own.\\"Coote, James; Olympic Report 1968 p52 International Athletes Club In 1958, some of the athletes who were of a standard to be selected for international competition formed the International Athletes Club (IAC), not as a competitive outlet but to give those athletes a voice at the various administrative bodies that made decisions affecting their athletic careers. By the 1970s one of the issues that concerned them was the selection of the team manager for international events. There was a feeling among the athletes that managers performed their duties more in the manner of a teacher shepherding a flock of naughty schoolchildren rather than as the manager of a team of international athletes. Gabbett was among those elected by the athletes to represent them on these matters.Athletics Weekly, (AW25.39.2) Gabbett's sporting success does not end at athletics. He has continued with sport all his life including competing in the bobsleigh with the Great Britain bobsleigh team. He is a coach not just of athletics but also of swimming and basketball and has been involved with several schools and independent teams including both his children's schools and clubs up to a National level. Legacy Although more than thirty years have elapsed since Gabbett last completed a decathlon, he is still ranked as the sixth best British decathlete, behind Daley Thompson, Dean Macey, Alex Kruger, Simon Shirley and David Bigham. His time for the 400m in a decathlon is still the fastest ever run at sea level. Gabbett's athletic form can be seen in sequences of the BBC Two documentary The Ascent of Man from 1973, narrated by Jacob Bronowski. He was filmed in slow motion running a sprint, pole vaulting and throwing a javelin.

He served as a Member of Parliament for ƒ∞stanbul's second electoral district from 2002 to 2015 and as an MP for ƒ∞zmir's second electoral district as of 7 June 2015. Before entering politics, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu was a civil servant and served as the President of the Social Insurance Institution (SSK) from 1992 to 1996 and again from 1997 to 1999. He was elected to Parliament in the 2002 general election and became the CHP's parliamentary group leader. In the 2009 local elections, he was nominated as the CHP candidate for the Mayor of ƒ∞stanbul and lost to the AKP (\\"Justice and Development Party\\") with 37% of the vote, where the candidate from the AKP got 44.71% of the votes. He was elected deputy chairman of the Socialist International on 31 August 2012. After Deniz Baykal resigned as the party's leader in 2010, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu announced his candidacy and was unanimously elected unopposed as the leader of the CHP. He was seen as likely to breathe new life into the CHP. Although the CHP saw a subsequent increase in its share of the vote, it has not won any elections as of 2019.  Early life  Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu was born on 17 December 1948 in Ballƒ±ca village of Nazƒ±miye district in Tunceli Province, eastern Turkey to Kamer, a clerk- recorder of deeds and his wife Yemu≈ü.

Kemal continued his primary and secondary education in various places like Erci≈ü, Tunceli, Gen√ß and Elazƒ±ƒü. He was educated in economics at the Ankara Academy of Economics and Commercial Sciences (now Gazi University), from which he graduated in 1971. During his youth days, he earned his living by selling goods.  Professional career  After university, Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu entered the Ministry of Finance as a junior account specialist in 1971. He was later promoted to accountant and was sent to France for additional professional training. In 1983, he was appointed deputy director general of the Revenues Department in the same ministry. At that time he worked closely with Prime Minister Turgut √ñzal. In 1991, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu became director-general of the Social Security Organization for Artisans and Self-Employed (Baƒü-Kur).

Early political career=Member of Parliament= Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu during a public appearance in 180px He retired from bureaucracy in 1999 and tried to enter politics from within B√ºlent Ecevit's Democratic Left Party (DSP). Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu was often referred to as the \\"star of the DSP\\". It was claimed that he would be a DSP candidate in the upcoming 1999 general election (in which the DSP came first). However, he did not succeed in this venture as he could not get on the party's candidates' list. Instead, during his chairmanship of an association that aimed to protect citizens' tax payments, he was invited by the leader of the CHP Deniz Baykal to join his party. Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu accepted the invitation. Following the 2002 general election, he entered the parliament as a deputy from Istanbul. In the 2007 general election, he was re-elected to parliament. He became deputy speaker of his party's parliamentary group. Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu's efforts to uncover malpractice among high-ranking Justice and Development Party (AKP) politicians carried him to headlines in the Turkish media. Two deputy chairmen of the ruling AKP, ≈ûaban Di≈üli and Dengir Mir Mehmet Fƒ±rat, resigned from their respective positions in the party following television debates with Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu. Furthermore, he publicly accused the AKP-affiliated Mayor of Ankara, Melih G√∂k√ßek, of complicity in a corruption scandal relating to the \\"Deniz Feneri\\" charity based in Germany. =2009 ƒ∞stanbul mayoral candidate= Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu was announced as the CHP's mayoral candidate for the 2009 local elections by the party leader Deniz Baykal on 22 January 2009. Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu announced that he would run his campaign based on clean politics, vowing to open cases of corruption against the serving incumbent, AKP mayor Kadir Topba≈ü. Claiming that he would work for the workers of ƒ∞stanbul, he also challenged Topba≈ü to a televised live debate. In the election, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu was beaten by Topba≈ü with 37% of the votes to Topba≈ü's 44.7%. = Election to the CHP leadership = Long-time leader of the CHP, Deniz Baykal, resigned on May 10, 2010 following a video tape scandal. Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu announced his candidacy for the position on May 17, five days before an upcoming party convention. According to reports, the party was divided over the leadership issue, with its Central Executive Board insisting that Baykal retake the position. But after Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu received the support of 77 of his party's 81 provincial chairpersons, Baykal decided not to run for re-election. For a candidacy to become official, CHP by-laws require the support of 20% of convention delegates. At the party convention, which started on 22 May 2010, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu's candidacy received the signatures of 1,246 out of the 1,250 delegates, which set a new record for the CHP. In view of this overwhelming support, the presidium of the party convention decided to move the election, initially scheduled for Sunday, forward to Saturday. As now expected, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu was elected as party chairman. The election was unanimous, with 1,189 votes (not counting eight votes that were found to be invalid). Leader of the Opposition Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu took office as the Leader of the Main Opposition on 22 May 2010 by virtue of leading the second largest political party in the Grand National Assembly. Many media commentators and speculators predicted that Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu would breathe new life into the CHP after consecutive election defeats under Baykal's leadership. =2010 constitutional referendum= Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu's first campaign as the CHP leader was the constitutional referendum held on 12 September 2010. Although the initial voting process in Parliament (that would determine the proposals that were voted on in the subsequent referendum) had begun under Baykal's leadership, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu employed a tactic of boycotting the parliamentary process. Since a constitutional reform proposal required 330 votes to be sent to a referendum (the governing AKP, which had submitted the proposals, held 336 seats), the parliamentary approval of all of the government's constitutional reforms was mathematically possible regardless of how the CHP voted. Thus, the AKP's proposed constitutional reforms, which included changes to the Turkish Judiciary, were sent for approval in a referendum on 12 September 2010. Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu not only campaigned for a 'no' vote against the proposals, but also sent the Parliamentary voting process to court over alleged technical irregularities. The CHP subsequently sent the proposals to court over alleged violations of the separation of powers in the proposed changes. the Constitutional Court eventually ruled against the CHP. Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu, along with members of minor opposition parties, argued that the proposed changes are an attempt to politicise the judiciary and further increase the control of the AKP over neutral state institutions. The referendum proposals were nonetheless accepted by 57.9% of voters, with 42.1% voting against. =2011 general election= Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu on a visit to Washington D.C., December 2013 The 2011 general election was the first general election in which Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu participated as the leader of Republican People's Party (CHP). The former CHP leader Deniz Baykal resigned from his post in May 2010 and left the CHP with 26% of the votes, according to opinion polls. Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu announced that he would resign from his post if he was not successful in the 2011 elections. He did not provide details as to what his criteria for success were. Over 3,500 people applied to run for the main opposition party in the June elections. Male candidates paid 3,000 Turkish Liras to submit an application; female candidates paid 2,000 while those with disabilities paid 500 liras. Among the candidates were former CHP leader Deniz Baykal and arrested Ergenekon suspects such as Mustafa Balbay and Mehmet Haberal. The party held primary elections in 29 provinces. Making a clean break with the past, Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu left his mark on the Republican People's Party's 435-candidate list, leaving off 78 current deputies as he sought to redefine and reposition the main opposition. The CHP's candidate list also included 11 politicians who were formerly part of center-right parties, such as the Motherland Party, the True Path Party and the Turkey Party. Center-right voters gravitated toward the AKP when these other parties virtually collapsed after the 2002 elections. Key party figures that did not make it on to the list, criticised the CHP for making \\"a shift in axis.\\" =June 2015 general election= Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu announcing the CHP manifesto for the June 2015 general election. The June 2015 general election was the second general election which Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu participated as the leader of CHP. The party won 11.5 million votes (24.95%) and finished with 132 elected Members of Parliament, a decrease of 3 since the 2011 general election. The decrease of 1.03% compared to their 2011 result (25.98%) was attributed to CHP voters voting tactically for the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) to ensure that they surpassed the 10% election threshold. No opinion poll (apart from one dubious poll released in March 2014) showed the CHP ahead of the AKP between 2011 and 2015. =2016 lawsuit= In January 2016 President Erdoƒüan filed a lawsuit against Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu for making statements that implied the President is a dictator after Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu spoke out against the arrest of over 20 academics who signed a petition condemning a military crackdown in the Kurdish-dominated southeast. What Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu said was: \\"Academics who express their opinions have been detained one by one on instructions given by a so-called dictator\\" An Ankara protester also opened an investigation into whether Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu's were \\"openly insulting\\" to the President. =Constitutional referendum= After the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum, which significantly expanded President Erdoƒüan's powers, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu and CHP filed a court appeal against a decision by Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council (YSK) to accept unstampted ballots. Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu has said that the YSK decision may be appealed to the ECHR, but members of the AKP government have said that neither ECHR nor Turkey's Constitutional Court have any jurisdiction over the YSK decision. Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu said: \\"In 2014 [the Constitutional Court] said ‚ÄòElections are canceled if there is no seal on ballot papers or envelopes.‚Äô[ ... ]The YSK can't express an opinion above the will of the parliament,[ ... ]If the Constitutional Court rejects our application, we will regard the changes as illegitimate. There is also the ECHR. If necessary, we will take the case there.‚Äù =ECHR= Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu criticized the European Court of Human Rights for rejecting a petition from a Turkish teacher who applied to the ECHR claiming that he was wrongly dismissed from his position during the 2016-17 Turkish purges. The ECHR said that plaintiffs should apply to Turkey's State of Emergency Investigation Commission before applying to the Court. Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu replied: \\"Don‚Äôt you know what is going on in Turkey? Which commission are you talking about? People are dying in prisons. We waited five months to just appoint members.\\" = Support for Grey Wolves = Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu has flashed the sign of the Grey Wolves, a Turkish ultranationalist organization with connections to the country's MHP (Nationalist Movement Party). It has been suggested that this is to compete with right-wing coalitions between the MHP and the AKP (Justice and Development Party). Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu has explicitly supported the deportation of Syrian refugees from Turkey, citing economic strain on citizens and the alleged desire of humans to live in their region of birth. = March for Justice = On 15 June 2017, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu started the 450 km March for Justice from Ankara to Istanbul in protest of the arrest of Enis Berberoƒülu following the 2016 coup d'√©tat attempt. Initially only joined by a few hundred protesters, the march grew to the thousands. On July 9, 2017, a final rally was held in Istanbul with hundreds of thousands of people. = 2018 = In April 2018, the President of Turkey Erdoƒüan scheduled two elections‚Äîthe parliamentary election and the presidential election.\\"Erdogan will Wahlen auf Juni vorziehen\\", Deutsche Welle.

He is generally acknowledged to be the founding father of urban planning in Western Australia. Early life Bold was born at Birkdale near Southport, Lancashire. After education in Lancashire and the Haberdashers' School in London he was an apprentice electrical engineer on the Forth railway bridge at Queensferry, Scotland, in 1888 to 1890. After returning to London he taught himself shorthand and worked as a clerk-typist with an Australian mercantile firm in the Baltic Exchange. He migrated to Western Australia in 1896 at the suggestion of a relative living in Fremantle. Western Australia In Perth Bold worked briefly with a merchant, and in the same year of his emigration he was clerk-typist to the town clerk of the city of Perth. He became acting town clerk on 27 November 1900, after H. E. Petherick was forced to resign. The council initially rejected his application for the vacant office and appointed a Melbourne candidate, who resigned ten days later. Bold's reappointment in an acting capacity in April 1901 was approved only after long debate and a close vote. On 30 September he was appointed town clerk, the youngest in any Australian capital. Town clerk Bold used as a model the technically efficient Birmingham of Joseph Chamberlain and expanded the size and improved the quality of city staff and streamlined its operations. He became a driving force in policy formation, preparing detailed reports for councillors and intervening in council debates. By 1905 some regarded him as the real mayor. Bold is described in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as an advocate of \\"municipal socialism\\": > He and the mayor T. G. Molloy, a kindred spirit, partly convinced and partly > tricked the council in 1908 into buying out the Perth Gas Co., which > produced both gas and electricity; a costly and controversial purchase at > the time, it eventually proved a valuable asset to the city. In 1912 Molloy > and Bold also fought hard to secure the tramways company, but were > outmanoeuvred and outbid by the Scaddan Labor government. Planning strategies In 1914 the council sent Bold on a tour of Britain and North America to gather information about municipal experiments and improvements. On his return he refined his 'Greater Perth' concept to include satellite garden and seaside suburbs, a redeveloped civic centre similar to Chicago's, and an overall plan on 'City Beautiful' lines. The 'Greater Perth' movement made some progress during World War I when Leederville, North Perth and Victoria Park voluntarily joined Perth; but the inner western suburb of Subiaco remained independent. In 1917, on Bold's recommendation, the Limekilns Estate in the western suburbs, by land already owned by the city, was bought. Sir James Mitchell's state government passed the City of Perth Endowment Lands Act in 1920 which enabled the council to develop and sell land in its trust. In the mid-1920s the council, at Bold's suggestion, invited architects to design satellite towns on the new lands. Floreat Park, Wembley Park and City Beach owed much to Raymond Unwin's writings and the 'City Beautiful' movement. The designs clearly showed the effects of Bold's 1914 tour with its parkways, boulevards, playing fields and gardens. Early homes there were functional and cheap enough for the thrifty worker, for Bold was a strong advocate of 'national efficiency'. In 1928 the first Australian town planning Act was passed by state parliament. It owed much to the Town Planning Association of Western Australia, established in 1916, and whose principals were Bold, Carl Klem, and the architect and city councillor Harold Boas. In 1930 Bold and Boas persuaded the council to establish a town planning committee. Later career In the 1930s Bold's ideas were less successful. The creation of Riverside Drive in 1937 enhanced the city foreshore but public criticism of his administration culminated in 1938 in a Royal Commission. One critic was David Davidson, Perth's first town planning commissioner, who alleged health and building regulations were not being observed and that there were too many slums. > Bold's contention that there had been only minor irregularities was > accepted, but the commission recommended immediate revision and updating of > the by-laws. Though it described him as 'very efficient and conscientious', > the report recognized that in pursuing his 'City Beautiful' ideals he had > become a little careless in his administration of the central city area. In > his long typescript reminiscences, written in 1944, Bold did not mention the > royal commission, though it had dominated his life at the time. At the > request of the mayor and council, he deferred his retirement through World > War II and, although ill, resigned only after he had trained a successor. Bold was awarded a C.B.E. in 1948. Other interests Bold was organist and choirmaster at the Hornsey Road Methodist Church, London, from 1892 to 1896. He was assistant organist at St George's Cathedral, Perth, and from 1897 organist at Wesley Church, Perth and later at St Aidan's Presbyterian Church, Claremont. He was also a Rotarian and, at one time, a Freemason. Family and estate Bold married Nellie Cooper on 9 October 1907 at Claremont; they had three children. He died at Tresillian Hospital, Nedlands, on 25 November 1953 and was cremated. His estate of ¬£7927 was left to his family. Bold Park and Reabold Hill Bold Park, a 437-hectare A-class reserve in Perth's western suburbs, is named for him. Within the Park, Reabold Hill is named for Bold and for Mayor of Perth Frank Rea. Reabold Hill is high and is the highest natural peak in the inner metropolitan area. References 1873 births 1953 deaths Australian urban planners People from Southport ","title":"William E.

M. elliptica leaves and fruit M. elliptica bark Melaleuca elliptica, commonly known as the granite bottlebrush is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the south of Western Australia. The Noongar name for the plant is gnow. It is commonly grown in gardens because of its neat foliage and showy, bright red flower spikes although it needs to be pruned regularly to avoid becoming woody and untidy-looking. In nature, it usually grows in the shrub layer in mallee woodland or heath. Description Melaleuca elliptica is a shrub with pale grey, papery bark usually growing to no more than high and wide. Its leaves are arranged in alternating pairs (decussate), each pair at right angles to the ones above and below so that there are four rows of leaves along the stems. The leaves are elliptic to egg- shaped with the ends usually rounded, and long, wide with a short stalk. The flowers are arranged in spikes on the sides of the branches, each spike up to in diameter and long and containing 20 to 60 individual flowers. The flowers range in colour from the more usual dark red through to pinkish-cream and appear over a long period from as early as August to as late as April. The petals are papery brown, long and fall off as the flowers age. The stamens are arranged in bundles of five around the flower, with 12 to 33 stamens in each bundle. The fruit are woody capsules, long and in diameter and form cylindrical clusters along the stem. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by botanist Jacques Labillardi√®re in 1806 in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. The specific epithet (elliptica) is from the Latin ellipticus meaning \\"elliptic\\", referring to the shape of the leaves. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca elliptica occurs in and between the Bendering in the west, to the Ongerup district in the south and as far east as the eastern edge of the Nullarbor Plain. It grows in sandy soils, often near granite outcrops in mallee woodland and heath. Conservation status Melaleuca elliptica is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This species is well known in cultivation as a hardy plant in sunny situations where the soil is reasonable well drained. It is frost hardy and adaptable to most situations in temperate regions but needs to be pruned regularly to avoid looking woody. Since the flowers usually appear on old wood, appropriate pruning can also be used to show the flowers to best advantage.

Another key player in the political struggle surrounding the compulsory national service was the Swedish Finance Minister Ernst Wigforss. Background The question of introducing compulsory national service for Swedish youth in secondary schools was raised in the winter of 1940 as a response to increased threat levels and a perceived regional insecurity due to the Second World War.Carlgren, W. ‚ÄùSvensk Utrikespolitik 1939-45‚Äù, Stockholm, Stockholm Allm√§nna f√∂rl., 1973, p. 196.

The proposed motion was that military education would be carried out in grammar schools, girls' schools, and other secondary schools as well as in primary schools. The education would consist of two parts: outdoor recreation days during the term and youth camps during summer vacation. Some of the military exercises (such as air-, gas- and fire protection, target-spotting, reconnaissance and reporting, and casualty care) would be coeducational, while others would be gender-specific. It was recommended that grenade-throwing exercises (with dummies) would start in grades 6 and 7, while target practise with air or small-bore rifles would occur from grade 8 in primary school.Richardson, Gunnar. ‚ÄùHitler-Jugend i Svensk Skol- och ungdomspolitik‚Äù, Stockholm, Hjalmarson & H√∂gberg Bokf√∂rlag AB, 2003, p. 21 The stated aim of the motion was to prepare the Swedish population for total war and give it knowledge about general security and safety measures, and a degree of familiarity with weapons and shooting. However, another secondary priority which was supposed to be achieved through the military exercises was the creation of a good public spirit; integration between social classes was also predicted. Finally, the motion implied that teachers at these camps would undergo an instructor training program and, having taken the program, would be qualified for permanent teaching jobs.Richardson, Gunnar. ‚ÄùHitler-Jugend i Svensk Skol- och ungdomspolitik‚Äù, Stockholm, Hjalmarson & H√∂gberg Bokf√∂rlag AB, 2003, p. 22-24. Press opinions The proposition produced a heated debate, with strongly polarised opinions in the media ‚Äì from outright rejection to unreserved support. The division largely followed the political spectrum, with conservative newspapers such as Nya Dagligt Allehanda, Svenska Dagbladet and Hallands Nyheter praising the proposition on the ground that it would lead to ‚Äúdisciplining and a spiritual uplift‚ÄùHallands Nyheter 4/1 1941 of the youth, while the left generally was very critical of the motion. The Social Democratic newspaper Socialdemokraten endorsed the proposition on the ground of its potential effects on social integration.Richardson, Gunnar. ‚ÄùHitler-Jugend i Svensk Skol- och ungdomspolitik‚Äù, Stockholm, Hjalmarson & H√∂gberg Bokf√∂rlag AB, 2003, p. 27. However, further to the left the opinion was overwhelmingly negative; the syndicalist newspaper Arbetaren stated that the proposition would lead to ‚Äúthe militarisation and barbarisation of the young souls‚Äù,Arbetaren 30/12 1940. and several others went as far as drawing parallels to Hitler-Jugend. G√∂teborgs-Tidningen expressed the concern that the aim was to create a Swedish Kraft Durch Freude phalanxG√∂teborgs-Tidningen 29/12 1940. and Eskilstuna-Kuriren claimed that the motion was dominated by ‚Äúemotional thinking‚Äù, declaring that Sweden did not need a ‚ÄúPer Albin- Jugend‚Äù.Eskilstuna-kuriren 9/01 1941. Objections to the motion mainly concerned: *The military orientation of the program, especially concerning younger students *The state‚Äôs mandatory camps *The alleged Nazi German model *The proposed instructor training program Richardson, Gunnar. ‚ÄùHitler-Jugend i Svensk Skol- och ungdomspolitik‚Äù, Stockholm, Hjalmarson & H√∂gberg Bokf√∂rlag AB, 2003, p. 27. Consulting opinions When the bill was presented to the Riksdag on 21 March 1941, it included a very select range of statements from the consulting organisations; the bill contained comprehensive reports from the public and church authorities, but a limited number of opinions from the roughly 20 volunteer organizations which had also commented on the proposal. The selection of statements from the consulting bodies demonstrates disregard for the opinions of the volunteer organizations and an unwillingness to reveal criticism of the motion by the Ministry of Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs. Notably, the National Board of Education endorsed most of the motion, but rejected the compulsory instructor program for teachers. The response from the other consultative bodies was mixed; certain organizations criticised the entire motion and others certain aspects of it, while still others supported it without any objections. The official summary presented to the Riksdag failed to reflect this diversity.Richardson, Gunnar. ‚ÄùHitler-Jugend i Svensk Skol- och ungdomspolitik‚Äù, Stockholm, Hjalmarson & H√∂gberg Bokf√∂rlag AB, 2003, p. 33-37. Passage alt=Black-and-white photo of former Swedish Education Minister G√∂sta Bagge When the government was to revise the motion, G√∂sta Bagge proposed changes in accordance with the advisory opinion of the National Board of Education. However, Ernst Wigforss (the Finance Minister) opposed the resolution. Both threatened to resign to get their way, raising the possibility of a government crisis in the middle of the war.Bagge, G√∂sta, ‚ÄúMinnesanteckningar 1941-42. RA. Despite this, the proposition was brought to the Riksdag on 21 March 1941. The first chamber ratified it and the second did not, leading to more modifications in an attempt to reach a compromise. Certain key issues were removed in the final version, which was ratified on 23 June 1941. This version differed from the first motion: *No weapons training for younger pupils *Shooting practice optional for grammar-school students *No compulsory summer camp *No compulsory instructor program for teachersRichardson, Gunnar. ‚ÄùHitler-Jugend i Svensk Skol- och ungdomspolitik‚Äù, Stockholm, Hjalmarson & H√∂gberg Bokf√∂rlag AB, 2003, p. 39-48. Effect on students The modified act was implemented during 1941, although preparations had been made during 1940 to train teachers at grammar schools for the exercises. The exercises which were enacted during 1941 were entirely of a military nature; shooting practise, although optional, was performed by most male grammar-school students.Skol√∂verstyrelsens Archive, Gymn.

Curran was born in Birmingham and began his career as a trainee with Torquay United, making his debut during the 1989‚Äì90 season whilst still a trainee. He turned professional on 13 July 1990 and went on to make 152 appearances for the Gulls, scoring 4 goals. On 22 December 1995 he was, surprisingly, sold to local rivals Plymouth Argyle for ¬£40,000, but failed to settle at Home Park, moving to Exeter City on 31 July 1997 for ¬£20,000. This move made him one of only a handful of players to have played for all three of the Football League sides in Devon. He made an impressive start to his career at Exeter, but in September 1997 picked up a serious knee ligament injury which ruled him out for the remainder of the season. He returned to the side and a regular place in the team, so much so that he was one of only a handful of players not released or transfer listed by manager Noel Blake in May 2000. He was appointed as club captain and in January 2001 was sent off in the game against Torquay United after only six minutes of the game. Having struggled with knee and hamstring problems, Curran was loaned to Tiverton Town in December 2002. He played eight times for Tiverton, before being recalled by Exeter as they unsuccessfully struggled to avoid relegation from the Football League. He suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon just before the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season and was released by Exeter. He relocated back to the Midlands to recuperate and enrolled on a Physical Education course at the University of Wolverhampton. In February 2004 he was reported to be looking to join a non- league club, and agreed terms with Weymouth, managed by Steve Claridge, the following month. However, he failed to appear for Weymouth and returned to the Midlands. He joined Willenhall Town in August 2004. In January 2005 he joined Newport County on trial, which resulted in a permanent move. He was released by Newport in September 2005 and returned to Willenhall Town.

The cast includes Bob Hoskins, Sadie Frost, Gemma Jones, Anna Massey, Peter McDonald, Maureen Lipman and Michele Dotrice. The film was produced by Goldschmidt's own company Viva Films Ltd. and was distributed on video by Koch Vision. Plot Captain Jack stars Bob Hoskins as a rebellious captain of a small Whitby boat who is determined to flout petty maritime bureaucracy. Officials declare his boat unsafe for a planned voyage to the Arctic, but Jack is determined to set sail and to place a plaque there in commemoration of his seafaring hero. With his motley crew, Captain Jack succeeds in making his voyage despite an international search for his boat by maritime authorities. Inspiration The film is based on a true life incident involving a Whitby man, Jack Lammiman, who declared that his ship was totally seaworthy but was being hampered from sailing by maritime rules. As in the film, he slipped out of the harbour unseen in 1991. His crew included a vicar, a lady pensioner and 62-year-old Royal Navy veteran named Hugh Taff Roberts. Lammiman successfully sailed his ship, Helga Maria, to the Arctic and fulfilled his wish to place a memorial plaque on Jan Mayen Island to honour Whitby whaling Captain, William Scoresby (see, William Scoresby his son). During the voyage he succeeded in evading an international search by the naval authorities using a number of techniques which including painting his boat a different colour. Lammiman arrived back at his home port of Whitby to a hero's welcome, a court appearance, a fine and eventually (after non-payment of his fine) four days in jail.

He is perhaps best known for his work in connection with the garden city movement, but was also active in other areas, including the design of churches and church fittings. Biographical summary Lucas was born in 1872 and articled to Walter John Nash Millard of Hitchin, Hertfordshire from 1889. After academic and professional training between 1889 and 1891 he held a number of posts as an assistant in various offices before setting up his own independent practice in Hitchin in 1895. Between then and 1919 he carried out much work, mainly domestic or ecclesiastical \\"in a manner marked by good taste and well-studied detail\\", to use the words of his obituarist and former partner. Many of his commissions were within Hertfordshire and included a number of private houses for high-status patrons. In 1903, in partnership with Sydney Cranfield, Lucas entered the competition for designs for a garden city at Letchworth which would make a reality of the ideas of Ebenezer Howard. The competition was won by Richard Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, but the design submitted by Lucas and Cranfield has been described as \\"an intelligent and pleasing plan, its main disadvantage being the separation of the north and south residential areas\\". Nevertheless, Lucas was responsible for the design of some of the houses in Letchworth, notably a group of cheap cottages at Paddock Close which were described as \\"The ¬£150 House\\". Of these houses he said, \\"Although simple, an effort has been made to obtain dignity, and an architectural treatment, without extravagance\\". Whilst a similarity in style can be seen, their simplicity forms a marked contrast with the more opulent houses which he was designing for private patrons at this time (for details, see section 2.1 below). A further embodiment of the garden city movement was Hampstead Garden Suburb. The Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust was formed in 1906 and the plans were prepared by Parker & Unwin, Unwin being architect to the Trust from 1906 to 1914. Lucas was one of a number of architects who made important contributions (listed in section 2 below). Hampstead Garden Suburb was followed by Romford Garden Suburb at Gidea Park where development began in 1910. Many of the architects who had contributed to Hampstead also contributed to Gidea Park, including Lucas, whose house at 54 Parkway took first prize among a group of more expensive exhibition houses. Lucas also showed a keen interest in the traditions of English church building throughout his life. It is an interesting comment on his versatility that at the same time as he was designing modern houses for private patrons and for the garden suburbs he was also producing church work in a completely medieval idiom in the form of chancel screens for Downham Market (1910) and the rather more impressive one for Swansea St Gabriel (1914). By this date he had come under the influence of Percy Dearmer: the frontispiece to the 1907 edition of the latter's The Parson's Handbook was a pen-and-ink drawing by Lucas which showed an English altar of the type promoted by Sir Ninian Comper and Dearmer. Lucas was associated with the Warham Guild following its formation in 1912 to provide church furnishings in the style favoured by Dearmer and he carried out further ecclesiastical work under its auspices. During World War I Lucas and other architects who had been associated with Unwin in the garden suburb movement joined him in the development of a great new settlement at Gretna designed to house workers in the large munitions factory that had been developed nearby on the Solway Firth. As part of this project he is known to have worked under Unwin in the construction of All Saints Episcopal church. After the war, in 1919, Lucas joined Henry Vaughan Lanchester to form the partnership of Lanchester & Lucas. This was enlarged in 1923 by the addition of Lucas's former partner, Thomas Arthur Lodge, to form Lanchester, Lucas & Lodge. Lucas took charge of the firm's work in housing and other branches during the absence of Lanchester in India. Work undertaken by the partnership during the time that Lucas was associated with it included commissions for Leeds University, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Messrs Bovril, Beckenham Town Hall and various housing schemes and buildings in India. In particular Lucas was closely connected with the design of a church at Hubballi in India. He withdrew from the partnership in 1930, possibly following some disagreement with its other members. It seems that he then retired from professional work but continued to pursue his personal interests. Lucas' tomb in the churchyard of Old St Mary's. In his later years Lucas's interest in ecclesiastical architecture increased, with an emphasis on the antiquarian side. He developed a theory that all medieval church plans were based on an underlying system of squares and he spent much time in measuring churches in pursuit of this idea. Lucas was elected an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1899 and a Fellow in 1911. In his later years he was also a member of the Society of Antiquaries. He died at his home in Walmer, Kent on 3 October 1947 and was buried in the churchyard of Old St Mary's in the town.

The Dual speed focuser is a focusing mechanism used in precision optics such as advanced amateur astronomical telescopes and laboratory microscopes. A dual speed focuser can provide two focusing speeds by using a set of co-axial knobs, one for fast focusing and another for fine focusing when the film or CCD is near the perfect focal plane. This is different from the two separate focusing knobs seen on low level microscopes. Another common reason to employ a dual-speed focuser is with the use of short focal length eyepieces, where the depth of focus is short, requiring critically accurate focusing. A dual speed focusing mechanism is often combined with a Crayford focuser, forming a Dual speed Crayford focuser in order to eliminate backlash during fine focusing. The concept Dual speed focuser design borrows the planetary gearing idea used in automobile gearboxes. However, in order to eliminate backlash, balls and axles are used instead of gears. All the transmission inside a dual speed focuser is achieved via static friction. The cylinder case of a dual speed focuser is fixed on the telescope tube. Three metal balls are placed 120¬∞ apart inside the case in a holder shelf. An input axle penetrates through the hole on the center of the holder shelf and is pushed and tightened by three surrounding balls. The fine focusing knob connects to the input axle while the fast focusing knob connects to the holder shelf. On the other side, the axle from the Crayford focuser is connected to the holder shelf. When one rotates the fine focusing knob, the three balls are driven by the input axle and rotate along the inner circumference of the case at a slower speed. The metal balls then push the holder shelf and drive the output axle. As a result, rotating either of the focusing knobs will cause the other to rotate in the same direction. Calculation The angular velocity of input and output axle can be described by the formula: :omega '=frac{omega r}{2(R+r)}, where the R and r are the radius of metal ball and input axle, and the omega and omega ' are the angular velocities of the input and output axles. A 1:10 dual speed focuser has a gear ratio of 10 and R=4.5r. Thus the angular velocity ratio is actually 11. The gear ratio and velocity ratio should not be confused with each other.

Van der Palm completed his studies at Leiden University in January 1784 and applied for appointment as a Minister in churches close to Leiden. There were several vacancies, but his progress was delayed because, being only 21 years old, he tended to be viewed as too young. He then started applying further afield in the province of Utrecht, and by December of that year he was fourth in place in a list six candidates being considered by Maartensdijk. Having worked to warm the classis (governing body) there in his favour, and following the necessary assessments, the classis made a formal offer to him and he undertook ministry there in March 1786. In November of that same year, he married Alida Bussingh, the daughter of a then-deceased friend of his from Delfshaven, and she joined him in Maartensdijk. As Beets reports, \\"The young minister enjoyed in this charge the greatest esteem and love. \\"The people had much patience with me,\\" he later said. His preaching was heard with great satisfaction. From Utrecht the people came very frequently to hear him, including students from the university.\\"Beets, p. 30. However, according to Beets, \\"In one thing the youthful minister felt himself deficient, and that too a very important, perhaps the most important part of the gospel ministry, - pastoral work. \\"In all uprightness,\\" he subsequently wrote (1791) to a friend, \\"it is not my case, I venture to say it is not my gift; and I never succeeded in it.\\"Beets, p. 31. The same opinion was expressed independently by others; for example, one official biographer wrote that after Maartensdijk van der Palm \\"never undertook the ministry again, especially because he, a good preacher, was a very poor pastor.\\" (Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren (DBNL).

At that time van der Palm was involved with the more moderate side of the Patriot movement, a complex group largely inspired by Europe's so-called Enlightenment principles and whose main objectives were the ending of the Stadtholderate (or stewardship) of William V, Prince of OrangeHis Stadholderate had been in demise since 1783 largely because of opposition from the Patriots, and in 1785 he had removed himself and his household from the Hague to Nijmegen in the more remote province of Gelderland. and the democratisation of the Netherlands after the model of the United States. They were opposed by an equally-complex group called the OrangistsThe words 'Orangist' and 'Orangism derived from the name of the Dutch noble House of Orange which had fulfilled the role of Stadtholder in the Dutch Republic in the period of its operation from 1588 to 1795, with Prince William V of Orange in this role at the time of van der Palm's life we are discussing here. whose uniting principle was the preservation of the nobility's role either as an absolute monarch or in a Stadtholderate role as had been set up in one form or another in the Dutch Republic from the time of the Spanish withdrawal in 1581 onwards.The Netherlands' relationships within the international context were made more complex by the fact that, at the time of the Anglo-French War (1778‚Äì1783), the Patriots were pro-French and pro- American and the Orangists were pro-British, an alliance that was also held in reverse.

Van der Palm had been raised in a household which strongly supported Patriot principles; he in turn met many of similar mind at university, including Professor Schultens, and then again found himself in the company of many more in Maartensdijk. Beets tells how a close friendship with poet Jacobus Bellamy \\"had blown the youthful fire of excited patriotism into a great flame\\" and because van der Palm was seen participating in civilian weapons exercises, and was even advocating this to others from the pulpit, he was criticised by \\"several people who were calmer, or who were attached to another party.\\"By which one assumes Beets meant \\"another party\\" to refer to the Orangists. (Beets, p. 34.) In the period 1780-1787, the control of the Orangists and Patriots varied from place to place, and specifically in the area relevant to van der Palm, the Patriots held power in the city of Utrecht while the surrounding province was controlled by the Orangists. Civil war escalated in that period; but the climax arrived in September 1787 when the Prussian army invaded at the order of King Frederick William II of Prussia, allegedly as an angry response to the way his sister, Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia, wife of Prince William V, had been arrested by Patriots while on her way to the Hague to argue the case for her husband's reinstallment as Stadtholder. However, she had been released two days later, and the more likely reasons for King Frederick William's action were to assist the Orangists in opposing the Patriots and to restore Prince William to the Stadtholderate.Although Prince William himself, referred to as gun-shy, had indicated that he would only return to the Stadtholderate if invited. Ultimately, Prussia was successful, many Patriots were driven into exile, and Prince William V was restored, briefly, as Stadtholder. Once the Prussian invasion began, and he was already under attack not so much from residents of his own town as Orangists from Bunschoten, van der Palm and his wife fledVan der Palm was not alone having to take flight from the combined Prussian-Orangist forces. There were a number of other Ministers who had actively supported the Patriot principles and therefore faced similar pressure (See Abels, Paul H. A.

Despite appeals from some for him to return to Maartensdijk, there was opposition from others; but regardless, van der Palm had no desire to do so, he tendered his resignation on 30 October, informal acceptance was received on 4 November, and formal release in writing was sent on 12 March 1788.

It was made up of representatives of the seven northern Dutch provinces constituted within the Republic, and each province had one vote in the decision-making process. By the end of 1778 van de Perre had resigned from all these positions so he could pursue his personal interests, especially in the sciences. He was an avid collector of arts objects, had already developed a large, comprehensive library, set up a science museumKnown eventually as the Museum Medioburgense, its foundation was carried out in association with the Zeeland Society of Sciences of which van de Perre was a founding member. In its early years the main focuses of the museum were medicine, theology and applied science, later expanding into other areas. It attracted strong support from the States of Zeeland who saw its function as being beneficial to the region. The Society still operates and was given the title 'Royal' in the 20th century.

(much of it in collaboration with his wife whose specific interest was physics).Van de Perre assisted her in founding the Natuurkundig Genootschap der Dames te Middelburg (Physics Society of Women in Middelburg) and often gave lectures at its meetings. He was also a charitable and generous man who frequently gave money to assist people in poverty, and he had a strong commitment to providing education especially for those to whom this was normally inaccessible. In 1787 van de Perre sought to appoint a person who would be able to maintain the library and museum, assist with his research, make the museum available to the general public, and at the same time perform the role of household chaplain. Van der Palm was appointed and took up duty in early 1788, being paid at the rate of 1,000 guilders per year plus expenses and a free house.In many sources comments are made about the surprising fact that a committed Orangist like van de Perre would choose to appoint and equally-committed Patriot to his household. Perhaps it speaks as much of van de Perre's tolerance, open- mindedness and equitability as it does of van der Palm's skills that this should happen. Although Beets points out that a condition of the appointment was that van der Palm never use his work as an opportunity to advocate his political points of view.Some members of the van der Perre family were critical of this arrangement on the grounds that van der Palm was being over- indulged by his employer, especially because he was spending some of his time pursuing his own interests. He continued in the position after van de Perre's death in April 1790, ending after the death of van de Perre's widow in 1794. At that time and aged 31, van der Palm became financially independent due to a legacy he had received from his late employer.PDCUL. \\"Dr. J. H. van der Palm\\" Accessed 20 January 2018. Because it is relevant to his future career, one important outcome of van der Palm's time in this position arose from his work as chaplain. A large worship place was set up at De Commanderij and services led by van de Palm were held there every Sunday afternoon. These were attended by the entire family and household staff as well as people who lived nearby. The preparation of sermons led van der Palm to engage in detailed exegesis of scripture along with critical studies and analyses of entire books of the Bible. An early result was the publication in 1791 of a book entitled Eenige Liederen van David, vertaald en opgehelderd, door JH van der Palm. (Some Songs of David, translated and clarified, by J. H. van der Palm)Palm, Johannes van der. Eenige Liederen van David, vertaald en opgehelderd, door' JH van der Palm. W. A. Keel / de Leeuw en Krap, 1791. Given this and the other biblical analysis van der Palm was carrying out at this time, the foundation was already being laid for his later translation of the entire Bible. Transition to public life Prince William V's final demise as Stadtholder began in 1793 when he joined the First Coalition against the newly-emerged French First Republic, participating in a struggle which had already begun in the previous year and continued until 1795 when the French Army, assisted by the Patriots who had been exiled in France and various revolutionaries who had remained in the Netherlands,Refer, for example, to an analysis of the Batavian Revolution in Amsterdam. finally marched into Amsterdam on 19 January, and Prince William V and his household fled into exile in Britain around midnight the day before. The old Dutch Republic was immediately replaced by a unitary state named the Bataafse Republiek (Batavian Republic) as a sister republic of the French Republic. Not long after, the old States-General was replaced temporarily by the Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland which operated as the central governing body until the new National Assembly was formed and held its first meeting in 1796. This assembly's operation was affected by highly opposed parties along with many others who could be placed somewhere in a spectrum between one side or the other depending on the matter being debated. A difficult topic was that of the constitution which was not put in place until 1797. Beets says that van der Palm and two other Zeeland citizens, wanting to avoid domination by the French or their functionaries from the centre of government, held a public meeting in Middelburg on 7 February 1795 at which van de Palm outlined its objectives. An organisation was formed, gave itself the title Middelburgse Comit√© R√©volutionair (Middelburg Revolutionary Committee), and van der Palm was appointed as its leader. Also in 1795‚Äì1796 he regularly wrote for and sometimes edited a weekly magazine called De Vriend des Volks (The People's Friend) whose objective was to monitor the needs of Zeelanders and propose ways in which these could be addressed. Then when the old States-General was replaced by the Provisional Representatives he was sent to represent the people of Zeeland.Beets, pp. 47-50.) First appointment to Leiden University The Academy Building (Academiegebouw), the oldest remaining structure at the University of Leiden. This was in use during van der Palm's entire involvement with the university. In June 1796Beets claims that van der Palm was approached about this position in early 1796 and that he declined.(p. 52). This appears to be contradictory to the university's records which show the appointment as being made on 1 December 1795 and van der Palm's oration being delivered on 11 June 1796. \\"Johan Hendrik van der Palm\\" Retrieved on 2 February 2018. van der Palm was appointed as Professor of Oriental Literature and AntiquitiesBeets, quoting van de Palm's correspondence with the university's curators shows the writer saying, \\"Your letter, informing me of my appointment as Professor of Oriental Literature and Antiquities in the University of Leyden, has been received ‚Ä¶\\" (p. 52.)His disciplines are shown by Leiden University to have been Oostersche Talen en Hebreeuwsche Oudheden (Eastern Languages and Hebrew Antiquities). (See \\"Johan Hendrik van der Palm\\". Accessed 20 January 2018.) at Leiden University. Regarding van der Palm's actual focus on teaching, Beets says that he \\"was not fond of the more profound, philosophical study of language, and linguistics had for him no attractiveness. He prized the knowledge of different languages for the books that were written in them, and studied them as much as was necessary to enable him thoroughly to understand them, and clearly to explain them to others. As professor in the Oriental department, he gave principally three lectures of general utility: on Hebrew grammar, Hebrew antiquities, and the philologico- critical investigation of the books of the Old Testament.\\"Beets, pp. 78-79. It could be assumed from this that, while he was a linguist of note and part of his reputation is built on this, the actual teaching of languages that fell within the field of his professorship must have been allocated to other staff.Indeed, the name of Hendrik Arent Hamaker ( has emerged as a contemporary and close colleague of van der Palm's during his second period at Leiden University.

A specialist in oriental languages especially Arabic, his involvement with Leiden began in 1817 and his full professorship in oriental languages ran from 1822 to 1835. Beets says he and van der Palm shared the teaching load of Hebrew grammar while Hamaker carried the full load of Arabic. This allowed van der Palm to concentrate on his specialty of philologico- critical investigation, especially of books of the Old Testament. (See p. 79.) In 1798 he was elected as the university's Rector MagnificusIn the Netherlands' universities the Rector Magnificus is the most senior academic position, always held by a person holding a professorship, from which the holder is responsible for administrative responsibilities, under whose authority academic appointments and promotions are made, and to whom orations are addressed by those being admitted to professorial chairs. a position he held until 1799 when he left to undertake work elsewhere. =Mature years=Politics Portrait of van der Palm attributed to Dutch artist Taco Scheltema and probably painted between 1801 and 1805. Under the influence of Enlightenment principles, this period was immediately preceded by and continued with an emerging new model of national identity and order. For the Dutch, it included a movement against the fragmented and stagnant old Dutch Republic and its replacement, in the mind of some, by a modern, unified nation built on a stronger sense of shared citizenship and common purpose. One core element was the idea that education was the need and right of all children. In the Netherlands, \\"Because education was ‚Ä¶ necessary in achieving patriotism and citizenship for all, these adherents of the new Dutch Enlightenment republicanism, in great majority moderate Protestants, developed a new pedagogical discourse.\\"Dekker, Jeroen J.H.. \\"From Imaginations to Realities: The Transformation of Enlightenment Pedagogical Illusions of the Dutch Republic into Late 19th-Century Realities of the Dutch Monarchy.\\" Schooling and the Making of Citizens in the Long Nineteenth Century: Comparative Visions.

Given the period of this debate and this writer's use of the words \\"moderate Protestants\\", it can be seen why van der Palm would have been an enthusiastic participant and that his views both as a Patriot and an educationist would have prepared him well to perform this role as education policy-maker in the new republic.For a detailed analysis of Dutch education policy and practice at this time and in the periods immediately before and after, see Glenn Jr, Charles Leslie.

In reality, however, the Batavian Republic was slow in bringing the details of these plans to fruition, and Dekker comments that van der Palm \\"showed himself a pragmatic and opportunistic administrator.

He received a state pension until his return to Leiden University. Return to Leiden University In 1806, at the age of 43, van der Palm returned to a professorship at Leiden University, this time in the fields of sacred poetry and rhetoric.

He took up his professorship on 26 September of that year, delivering an oration entitled De Oratore Sacro Litterarum Divinarum Interprete (On the Sacred Orator, An Expositor of the Holy Scriptures).As quoted by Beets, Professor Siegenbeek outlined the content of this speech thus: \\"In it he marked out for the ministers of religion the only way by which they can attain the high and holy end of sacred eloquence; the way, in which, as formerly, so especially afterwards, he preceded them in the most illustrious manner. In his lectures on sacred eloquence he expanded the hints and instructions contained in this discourse, illustrated them by well- selected examples, and thus gave his hearers a text-book of sacred eloquence, which, it is greatly to be lamented, has been confined to the circle of his pupils. Sometimes he varied those lectures, by expounding for the benefit of his hearers, in his peculiarly rich, tasteful, and felicitous manner, portions of the Holy Scriptures, with a special view to the use to be made of them by the sacred orator. I may mention for example the principal parables of the Saviour, respecting which it were also to be desired, that his more copious illustrations of them had not remained the precious possession of his private hearers.\\" (pp. 74-75) In 1805, however, Rau was reprimanded by the university because of his political opinions and his professorship was restricted to theology, meaning that responsibilities for oriental literature and antiquities were returned to van der Palm while also continuing to hold sacred poetry and rhetoric.\\"Johan Hendrik van der Palm\\".

However, he declined that offer in view of the weight of other work (his focus on the translation of the Bible being the most time-consuming). Re-emergence of the House of Orange In the midst of all this, the House of Orange continued to demonstrate interest in re-establishing its power, particularly through Prince William Frederick, the eldest son of Prince William V who was therefore Erfprins Hereditary Prince. As a child he had grown up in the Dutch Republic and his education was centred around the military arts. He also studied briefly at Leiden University but was taken away from it in 1790 when his father appointed him to the rank of general in the State Army and a member of the State Council of the Netherlands. He then participated in a number of major battles against the French Republic until that country asserted its power and successfully invaded the Netherlands and the royal family was forced into exile. Prince William's involvement in warfare continued over several years, with varying degrees of success. In the meantime, the Batavian Commonwealth's government and society continued to be impaired by factionalism and inefficiency (the same problems that led van der Palm to withdraw from public life and return to teaching at Leiden University) along with growing dissent towards the government. The turning point was Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig in October 1813 followed by withdrawal of French troops from everywhere in Europe including the Netherlands. The following month former Orangists and Patriots joined forces to create a new government, and in December they welcomed the return of Prince William, this time with the old north and south portions of the Low Countries united as one nation.At a glance, the unification of former Orangists and Patriots under a House of Orange monarch seems odd; but as one commentator has written, \\"William I described himself as the natural successor of Charles V, with a mission to complete the aborted attempts of state formation in the Netherlands in the sixteenth century. However the Burgundian myth [that is, of a Burgundian pan- Netherlandish Golden Age] never really took hold as a dominant political memory in the new kingdom.‚Ä¶ William's attitude toward the problematic Batavian and Neopolnic past can be described as an implicit politics of forgetting or oubli.\\" (See Lok, M.. \\"The bicentennial of '1813-1815' and national history writing: remarks on a new consensus\\".

By 1830, the Belgian Revolution was underway and the outcome was the secession of the southern provinces and the formation of the Kingdom of Belgium under its own monarch. Beets says that van der Palm \\"rejoiced in the revolution of 1813, and attached himself, with the entire nation, fully and sincerely to the House of Orange. Of this his patriotic utterance in 1813, his religious observation of the joyful prospects of the Netherlands, his poetic effusion, \\"The Peace of Europe\\" in 1814, his sermon to excite Christian heroism in 1815, and in 1816 his Historical and rhetorical account of the emancipation of the Netherlands, in the year 1813, furnish abundant proofs.\\"Beets, p. 71.

Contrast that with his allegiance to the moderate Patriot cause prior to the Prussian invasion of 1787, his submission to the restrictions imposed by van de Perre, and his political career in the Batavian Republic-cum-Commonwealth, some might assume that van der Palm was prepared to align himself with the latest political fad at any one time. But the other side of the picture could be as expressed here: \\"Thus amid various vicissitudes forty-three years of his life had passed away. ‚Ä¶ In all this he is actuated, less by a becoming ambition, than by an ardent desire to be useful to his country.\\"Beets, p. 73. The constant picture of van der Palm is that his primary objectives were positive discourse, harmonious social interaction, concordance and peace, and therefore hypocritical game-playing, aggressive self-promotion and grandiose point-scoring could never play any role in achieving good outcomes.

The same is said of his approach to fatherhood: \\"In no one was the paternal character more perfectly expressed; even without being allied to him by blood, one could hardly refrain from calling him father. Surrounded by his children and grandchildren, he seemed truly a patriarch of the olden time; to promote their happiness, to augment their pleasure, to gather them joyous and sportive around him, was the delight of his life. He ever found time in the midst of his most serious employments, yea, during the last years of his life, amid weakness and suffering, to devise plans for their amusement, to rejoice them with presents, to entertain them, and by great and small attentions of every kind to show how largely they shared in the affections of his heart; to participate in their pleasures, in their sports, to laugh at their innocent folly, and to take an interest in what they deemed important, though it had become far beneath his attention.Beets, pp. 114-115.

Theological views The climate of van der Palm's life was characterised by social changes which brought with them broad challenges, including those to the function and operation of religion. Taking these into account helps us to understand how and why his theological views were developed. Although prior to 1795 the Dutch Reformed Church (Nederduits(ch)e Gereformeerde Kerk as it was then known) had not been adopted as a state church, it had been the church to which the House of Orange belonged, and with the majority of the population as adherents, it still held a privileged position within the social structure and government. So, for example, under the law any person holding a government position was required to be a member of the Reformed Church, and in the process this allowed the Reformed Church to remain a dominant if unofficial force within the functioning of secular society. As a result, and despite a few exceptions, some other groups felt isolated, especially when it came to participating in local, regional and state government, civil service or the judiciary. This favourable position was largely deconstructed, at least at government level, during the period of Napoleonic rule, although this was not uniform throughout Dutch society and there were still many who could see no need for change. In the previous century or more, waves of Reformist movementsSee History of religion in the Netherlands. and divisions within the Reformed Church had already emerged. Even more significantly, there had already been a massive intake of immigrants: refugee Huguenots from France and Puritans from England, increasing numbers of Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews (although Jewish people had been living there since the time of the Roman invasion. For these and other reasons, at this time Dutch society was possibly the most culturally diverse in Europe. Incorrectly, some writers have made unqualified claims that Dutch society in this period was highly tolerant because these various religio- ethnic subgroups respected each other and their rights to live in accordance with their beliefs and traditions.Take, for example, this glib statement in an historical overview: \\"Although Calvinist communities elsewhere incline to intolerance (New England, for example), the Dutch remain true to their republic's founding declaration in the 1579 Union of Utrecht- that \\"every citizen should remain free in his religion, and no man may be molested or questioned on the subject of divine worship.\\" The freedom which they originally claimed for themselves, these Calvinists extend with admirable consistency to others.\\" (Historyworld \\"History of the Netherlands\\". Accessed 4 March 2018.) Others explain that, while the claim of religious tolerance is a part of Dutch national pride, examination of the Dutch Republic's Golden Age and later reveals a different picture.For an excellent overview of tolerance in this period, see Schuyt, Kees. \\"Tolerance and democracy\\".

As one analyst points out, \\"The dominant Protestants did not accept Catholics ‚Äì their enemies in the Reformation and in the war against Spain ‚Äì and Jews as equals in the sense of the second definition of tolerance, but they tolerated them in the sense of the first definition and thus allowed them to practice their religion ‚Äì even if the Catholics had to hide their churches in places like Amsterdam. This indulgence seems not to have been guided by any high principle of tolerance, but by pragmatism: Foreigners, whatever their religion, were good for the economy, and the same was true for peaceful coexistence instead of conflict. Moreover, elite Dutch merchants had learned to bargain and negotiate and become used to apply these practices also in politics. In pragmatic politics, nobody owns the truth; what is true has to be agreed upon, and when an agreement cannot be reached, it must still be possible to coexist according to the principle of live and let live.\\" (Becker Uwe. \\"Dutch Tolerance: Something to learn from?\\" \\"Dutch Tolerance\\". Accessed 7 March 2018.In a period when many believed that a formal relationship between the state and a particular denomination of religion was both beneficial and necessary, and a number of European states had acted in that way, another analysis of the meaning of tolerance in Dutch society puts forward this option: \\"While modern readers think of tolerance in terms of equality, early modern Europeans had a completely different conception. For them, tolerance was at best a begrudging acceptance or, more accurately, a refusal to use state power to force people to worship in a certain way.\\" As the author goes on to say, \\"Tolerance, it was said, was 'long a loser‚Äôs creed.' Even during the Enlightenment, when reason was supposed to curb the excesses of the religious fanaticism that plagued the Reformation era, tolerance was uneven and sporadic. Only a few religious groups, such as the Anabaptists, truly advocated religious tolerance as central to their creeds. Most groups only tolerated ideas that did not stray too far from the standard religious tenets.\\" (See Cleave, Peter van.

Accessed 22 March 2018 Regardless of the fluctuation of tolerance from one setting to another, modern social analysis recognises that cross-culturalisation is a dominant outcome of situations similar to this in the Netherlands, and that such social change is an observable and measurable consequence.For a broad understanding of the phenomenon of cultural change, see Inglehart, Ronald, and Christian Welzel. Modernization, Cultural Change, and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence. Cambridge University Press, 2005. . As stated above (See 1.3.1 Operation in Politics), the evolution of social, cultural, political and religious ideas we label under the term \\"Enlightenment\\" were a major influence on van der Palm. Enlightenment concepts had begun to emerge in the Netherlands by the middle of the 17th century carrying among them considerations about the primacy of reason, the rights and roles of the individual, constitutional government, the separation of church and state, and, more specifically, the replacement of a world-view based on theological belief structures with one derived from philosophical discourse.Bunge, Wiep van, Editor.

This is the climate in which van der Palm's scholarship and theology were formed. Utrecht researcher van Eijnatten's assessment of the period drew this conclusion about van der Palm among his contemporaries: > \\"Van der Palm was representative of a new generation of theologians who had > appointed themselves moral leaders of the Dutch nation. They integrated the > anti-deist ethic of politeness into the politico-religious ideology that had > underwritten the Dutch state since the French-inspired Batavian Revolution > of 1795.

The context of van Eijnatten's essay began with this opening statement: > \\"Charity and peace for all mankind are usually ranged among the > characteristic aspects of the message put forward in the sacred texts on > which the Christian religion is based. Yet the official interpreters of > these texts (theologians and ecclesiastical office holders) in Western > countries of the early modern period are often associated with exactly the > opposite: with hostility, antagonism, belligerence‚Äî in short, with what was > at the time called odium theologicum or theological hatred.\\"Eijnatten > (2002), p. 310. As shown below, this tension between benign, discursive philosophico-religio- ethical consideration and dogmatic, aggressive credalism was active in van der Palm's lifetime, as well as before and after. As a prerequisite of his ordination to ministry in the Reformed Church, van der Palm would have ascribed to the church's doctrines as set out in the Drie formulieren van Enigheid (Three Forms of Unity),That is to say the Canons of Dort from 1618, the Belgic Confession as revised by the 1618-19 Synod of Dort and written into the Canons of Dort, and the Heidelberg Catechism from 1563. For this reason it can be assumed that van der Palm would have seen himself as belonging to a theological approach directly descended from Calvin. On the other hand, though, he has been referred to as a religious moderate to whom the expression of dogmatic theological views was not an option.Indeed, van der Palm's classification as a moderate, and his position in terms of Calvinist doctrine, are well-illustrated in Schutte, J. A.. Groen van Prinsterer: His Life and Work. Translated by Harry van Dyke. Based on the 1977 edition with further revisions by the author. Publishers' Imprint, 2005. p. 8. At this time, 1824, van Prinsterer, aged 23, was a student at Leiden University where one of his teachers was van der Palm, and the two of them had become friends. Van der Palm's colleague on staff, Joan Melchior Kemper had died and there was discussion about van Prinsterer replacing him. As Schutte reports, \\"Kemper, Borger \\"Elias Annes Borger\\", van der Palm ‚Äì the names indicate the climate of opinion that reigned in Leyden during Groen's university days: self- consciously Netherlandic, urbane, and Protestant in the sense of a watered- down Calvinism, above all liberal and moderate. reasonably confident in progress and perfectibility.\\" While \\"watered-down\\" might be seen as meaning \\"uncommitted\\" or \\"without purpose\\", the picture that has already emerged of van der Palm indicates that he was quite the opposite. His mind was set on other objectives. It is not surprising then that extensive searching so far through his sermons, correspondence and other literature has found no direct quotes of Calvin or other reformists and only one general reference to Luther, Calvin, Zwingli and Melanchthon as a group. This occurs in SalomoVol. 6, p. 849-856. \\"Salomo, Vol. 6\\" where van der Palm analyses Proverbs 22:12, \\"The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge, and he overthrows the words of the transgressor.\\" (De oogen des Heeren bewaren de wetenschap; maar de zaken des trouweloozen zal Hij omkeeren.). At the outset of his text, van der Palm discusses the meaning of wetenschap (that is 'science' in its specific meaning as 'knowledge') in relation to the Hebrew word from which it was translated. And having argues that the Hebrew usage of 'knowledge' was synonymous with 'truth', his conclusion was \\"Wetenschap is hetzelfde als kennis, en wel zuivere, gezonde kennis, kennis der waarheid.\\" (That is to say, \\"Science is the same as knowledge, and pure, sound knowledge, knowledge of the truth.\\") On these grounds, he goes on later to say, \\"If there is a chance for the matter of truth to be so haphazard among men, fortunately there is a defender in heaven, whose eyes watch it, and who makes the glib words of the faithless slippery to their own fall.\\" He then draws a parallel between, on one hand, God's call to Abraham and the relationship with the nation of Israel followed by their betrayal of that commitment, and the work undertaken by the reformists on the other, saying \\"so that a Luther, Calvin, Zwingli and Melanchthon and others could arise, old understandings (or \\"knowledge\\", that is knowledge of the \\"truth\\") would have to be revived from the dead.\\" Salomo, p. 857.In a survey of Calvin's attitudes towards religious liberty, personal conscience and the law, US legal analyst Witte provides two contrasting images of Calvin. In the first, Calvin in his twenties and at the beginning of his reformation work is described as demonstrating \\"a bold and brilliant young mind at work.\\" (pp. 15-16) By the time Calvin is in his early- to mid-forties, the picture changes. Or as Witte says, faced with alternative ideas from others or opposition to his views, \\"Calvin found little convincing in such criticisms, and in his later years ‚Äì as his critics multiplied and insurrection in Geneva mounted ‚Äì he defended his views with ever more bitter vitriol. (p. 31-32) (See Witte, Jr., John. \\"Moderate Religious Liberty: John Calvin and the Geneva experiment.\\" Public Law & Legal Theory Research Paper Series, Research Paper No. 04-2. Emory University School of Law, 1996. \\"Moderate Religious Liberty\\". Accessed 9 March 2018.) A reading of Witte's study reveals that, overall, his overall assessment of Calvin is favourable, even though it reveals to way in which Calvin became more and more dogmatic in his views, especially when challenged by others. But that is not relevant to this survey of van der Palm. Indeed, how much van der Palm knew about the details of Calvin's life is not revealed. There can be no doubt that van der Palm would have studied Calvin's theology in depth, and to his moderate mind its dogmatic tone and content would not have attracted him. The attitudes of van der Palm and other Dutch moderates to Calvin's theology emerge in an independent 1821 report published in the United States:\\"State of Religion in Holland. (From the Christian Disciple, Boston, March, 1821.)\\" The Monthly Repository of Theology and General Literature. January to December 1821 inclusive, Vol. 16. Sherwood, Neely and Jones, 1821. pp. 418-420. > \\"A sermon has been published, pronounced by a Professor of Theology at > Leyden, in which the doctrine of predestination is described as a frightful > doctrine, ‚Äì dishonourable to God, ‚Äì and absurd, ‚Äì representing the Deity as > practising a deception upon his creatures, inviting and calling them to > repentance and salvation, after having predetermined the everlasting misery > of the greatest part of them.

On the subject of the atonement he is positive; he does not, > however, explain it as an infinite satisfaction to enable the Deity to be > merciful towards his creatures, but for some reasons inexplicable to us, as > a means by God ordained, and necessary to our salvation.

Professor Vander Palm > speaks of Christ always in the language of the Bible, and as the image of > God‚Äôs glory revealed on earth; that in him we see the Father; that his > wisdom, power and love, are those of the Father, and that thus exalted, > perfected and glorified by the Father, we must love and obey Christ as we do > the Father. He represents Christ's present exaltation, ‚Äúnot because he was > from eternity with the Father, but because he has been made perfect by > obedience and suffering, and has obtained the delivery of men by his > blood.‚ÄùGood illustrations of this biblical interpretation can be found laid > out in his sermons on the texts Matthew 13:44-46 and I Corinthians 1:30. > (See Beets, pp. 177- 199; 222-239.)

It seems to me obvious, > therefore, that the doctrine of the Trinity is abandoned by the greater > part, and the most learned of the Dutch clergy, not less than the doctrine > of Predestination.\\" The attitudes of orthodox Calvinists towards those holding moderate or reformist views in politics or religion were mutual because those Calvinists who, believing they were following a valid interpretation of faith, saw themselves as being threatened by anyone expressing alternative views.Dekker, p. 59. But as the 1821 report tells us: > \\"It is not long ago, however, that the slightest departure from the Creed > established in 1618, was followed by a formal dismissal of a minister from > any of the Established Churches. The Synods and classes were particularly > watchful ‚Äúfor the preservation of the only true doctrines and the purity of > the faith, as settled and declared by the Fathers of the CouncilOr \\"Synod\\" > as it is usually called. of Dort.‚Äù But we may suppose the national general > Synod of 1817 to have represented the opinions of the great majority of the > Dutch theologians, at least of the most learned and esteemed among them, and > of the heads of the Universities. The perfect freedom allowed by this Synod > to the ministers of religion, to take the Bible as their standard of faith > and doctrine, amounts to a virtual abandonment of any system of orthodoxy. Van der Palm's theology included a disinterest in credal expressions and doctrinal formulae. As teacher and preacher he preferred to focus on expounding the biblical story as a basis for and approach to life and faith. This is well-stated in his explanation of German Lutheran theologian Theodor Fliedner: > \\"German theologians who believe that God revealed himself usually place too > much stress on the single dogmas of the Trinity, or Sin, or Regeneration. We > Dutchmen do not deny them but in our sermons we place them more in the > background, partly because they are incomprehensible and partly because the > consequences and developments of these early dogmas in later time have > become totally unbiblical. In contrast, we stress the forgiveness of sin, of > reconciliation, of the duty to give Christ the glory; and those doctrines we > teach most frequently.\\"TenZythoff, Gerrit J.. Sources of Secession: The > Netherlands Hervormde Kerk on the Eve of the Dutch Immigration to the > Midwest. Wm. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1987. p. 100. . In practical terms, therefore, van der Palm set out this principle in a sermon where he is quoted as saying, \\"As the apostle John left the secret of Christ's nature unresolved for his pupils, so will I not try for you to lift this veil of mystery.\\"TenZythoff, p. 101. van der Palm and others of a similar mind were both widely supported, but also criticised by those who begged for a return to the orthodoxy of a former era.TenZythoff, p. 102. From his preaching and writings it is clear that van der Palm held the conventional supernaturalist view that the created world in all its observed forms including its ethical structure was created by and subject to the will and power of a deity, in his case, the God as revealed in the Bible especially through Jesus.The integration of such a view as held in van der Palm's time is demonstrated in a specific analysis of history by an author who recorded the French invasion in the following way: \\"The President (that is Pieter Paulus, a former Patriot who was elected as first president of the Batavian Republic's new Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland) in his first speech, complimented the members of the assembly as lawful representatives of the people; he called their attention to the Divine Providence, which, in so particular a manner, had favoured the success of the friends and deliverers of the country by the severe frost, which had covered the rivers and waters with ice. He acknowledged the sovereignty of the people, and the sacred rights of man.\\" (Walker, John. Elements of geography and of natural and civil history, Third edition. Thomas Morton Bates, 1797. pp. 411-412.) A similar attitude lay behind the sentiments expressed about Prince William V's return to the Stadtholderate in 1795: \\"There is no God who can deliver such as the \\"God of the Netherlands\\".\\" (Abels and de Groot, p. 429.)Other evidence points towards a decline in supernaturalist views in the Netherlands at this time. (Abels and de Groot, pp. 427-428.) This view is reflected in Beets' biography of van der Palm where he makes frequent reference to Voorzienigheid (Providence - a synonym for God or God's power): for example, addressing the question of how it was that he came to be writing the book at all, he asks, \\"Why did it not please Providence to permit the noble Van der Palm to leave one of his four sons behind him, who, resembling him in disposition, formed by him from childhood, might have been able to perform it more worthily, and entirely in his spirit ? Such was not the Divine will.\\"Beets, p. 84. When in 1801, in his government position of Minister for National Education, van der Palm was asked to review the relationship between church and state, his initial recommendation was that the connection between the state and the Reformed Church should be formalised. This idea was not set in place, and van der Palm's response was to propose that all churches, including the Catholic Church, should be nationalised, especially in their role as suppliers of education. This was built on his view that the teaching of religion in schools should be directed towards the moral development of children but free of denominational or doctrinal content.Another Dutch moderate contemporary, possibly his assistant van der Ende, is quoted as saying that \\"the primary schools should be Christian, but neither Protestant nor Catholic. They should not lean to any particular form of worship nor teach any positive dogmas; but should be of that kind that Jews might attend without inconvenience to their faith.\\" (See Glenn, p. 240.) This stirred wide opposition from those churches who wanted to use their own schools as environments in which they could propound their own theological interpretations, along with parents, especially more conservative Calvinists, who expected all schools, including those run by the state, to play a role in doctrine-based religious education. Although Biblical criticism is generally thought to have emerged as a discipline by the end of the 19th century, it clearly has its beginnings in the 17th centuryThe first such example was Richard Simon's 1678 Histoire critique du Vieux Testament which was followed in 1689 by Histoire critique du texte du Nouveau Testament: o√π l'on √©tablit la verit√© des actes sur lesquels la religion chr√™tienne est fond√©e., and van der Palm along with other contemporaries advanced this further. Their primary interest was the study of those languages, especially Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic, Koinƒì or Biblical Greek and Arabic, in which the Old and New Testament documents were either originally written or circulated. By doing so, they understood this would greatly assist them to better understand the original meaning of the texts and lead to more accurate translations into modern languages. Van der Palm had a particular interest in Arabic because he held the view that some ancient fragments of the Old Testament that had been discovered at that time would help to explain anomalies in the Hebrew text. Furthermore, because of knowledge of poetic structure, he was better able to identify and comprehend poetic expression which occurs frequently in the Old Testament and less often in the New. Comparing their translations from the original languages with other translations made from different source documents, van der Palm and others placed little merit on the Vulgate or Latin translation most of which was made from secondary sources not in the original languages. Similarly, flaws and inaccuracies were evident in the Septuagint or LXX as it is often called (the reference in both names being to falsely-claimed legend that this translation had been carried out by 70 scholars), a translation from Hebrew into Koinƒì Greek of the Old Testament and other non-biblical documents.Evidence shows that this translation was commenced in the 3rd Century B.C.E. and was in wide circulation because quotes from it appear in the New Testament, most frequently in the Pauline epistles. Regarding van der Palm's attitude towards Roman Catholicism, as was common among members of Protestant denominations at that time, he would have had little or no exposure to its theology or worship. From his own moderate approach to dogma, he would have found Catholicism unnecessarily strict, authoritarian and hidebound; and the fact that worship was conducted in a language (Latin) not spoken or understood by a majority of participants, the laity's lack of access to the Bible in their own language and with the ignorance that arose from that, together with what was seen as a reliance on \\"superstitious\\" elements such as the veneration of saints or the use of the Rosary would have seemed irrational and illogical.As a commentator has put it, \\"an important consideration was that its organizational form permitted foreign, papal influences and the Dutch government took no opportunity to exert influence on the clergy. The Catholic Church and its priests were in fact typified as non-Dutch. They were also measured according to the Protestant norm of being useful, civilized and enlightened citizens. The fact that they were found to be too insignificant formed the prevailing view within the Dutch (Protestant) society that led to a deterioration of the social position of Catholics.\\" (See Bijleveld, Nikolaj Hein. Voor God, Volken en Vaderland: De plaats van de hervormde predikant binnen de nationale eenwordingsprocessen in Nederland in de eerste helft van de negentiende eeuw (For God, People and Fatherland: The place of the reformed preacher in the national unification processes in the Netherlands in the first half of the nineteenth century). Eburon, 2007. pp. 25-26. .) Nevertheless, even though, in his view, the Catholic Church seemed to have been \\"left behind by the Enlightenment\\", van der Palm accepted Catholics as being a significant part of the Batavian population and did not propose or support their isolation from society or the affairs of government, especially education.Bijleveld, p. 26. Indeed, of all the religious subcultures functioning within Dutch society in van der Palm's lifetime, it was the Catholic and Reformed Churches (and for a short time the Jews) which appear to have gained the most. Although never formally expressed in constitutional form, the more democratic and reformative climate of the Batavian Republic after 1798 meant that religious bodies were of equal status, citizens were therefore free to worship and practice according to their own personal choice, belonging to any particular religious body gave no advantage to individuals, and the internal and external operations of all religious organisations were subject to civil law. Then from 1800, despite there being no state church, the government asserted more control over the churches by administering membership, paying the clergy, financing church building and many church social bodies, promoting new theologies, and suppressing ultra-orthodoxy and aggressive evangelism. Between 1800 and 1870 there were two state departments, one for the administration of the Reformed Church and the other for the Catholic Church. In 1816 the new monarch, King William I reconstituted the Reformed Church under the name Nederlandsche (or Nederlandse, according to the new spelling) Hervormde Kerk, with a new constitution which gave civil authorities control over the appointment of new clergy, the choice of those who attended synods, and what preachers could say from the pulpit. A graphic breakdown of religious views at this time shows minorities of 'ultra-liberal' and 'ultra-orthodox representation at each end of a pole, next larger representations of those called \\"liberal\\" and \\"strict\\", and on either side of the balance point an equal majority of those who are either \\"moderate\\" or \\"conservative.\\"Sengers, Erik. \\"European Exceptionalism: Lazy Churches, Pluralism, Adherence, and the Case of the Dutch Religious Cartel.\\" Church and Religion in Contemporary Europe: Results from Empirical and Comparative Research. Edited by Gert Pickel and Olaf M√ºller. Springer-Verlag, 2009. p. 169. According to this model, van der Palm, the epitome of moderatism, should have found himself in the most comfortable of all possibilities. As van Eijnatten has said, \\"Van der Palm was representative of a new generation of theologians who had appointed themselves moral leaders of the Dutch nation. They integrated the anti-deist ethic of politeness into the politico-religious ideology that had underwritten the Dutch state since the French-inspired Batavian Revolution of 1795.\\"Eijnatten (2002), p. 328. But more than a passive participant or even a grand public moraliser, van der Palm emerged in the eyes of others clearly as one who lived out his everyday existence by exactly the same standards he would have aspired for the society around him: > \\"The chief trait of his character was love. If any one, he understood, he > practised in all relations this Christian virtue in its whole extent. It was > not only his constant endeavor to promote the happiness of others, of many, > to secure it, to augment it in various ways, and to see that justice was > done them; but he especially exercised himself, with considerate > scrupulousness, to impair, to becloud no one's happiness, no one's pleasure, > by word or look or silence, ‚Äì a matter often far more difficult, and > accompanied with greater self-denial, than the conferring of a benefit or > the rendering of a service. Charitable in his views of others, and mild in > his utterances respecting them, nothing was so odious to him as suspicion, > evil speaking, rash judging.Beets, p. 117. Bible translator The individual books of the Bible originally arrived in written form in ancient languages, Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic in the case of the Old Testament, and for the New Testament Koinƒì Greek. By modern times, it has been translated into almost every language in the world. In most cases, translations have been made from texts other than those in which they originally appeared. Only a minority have been undertaken using ancient sources in the original languages as sources.Luther's translation into German was another which was carried out in this way, although having been undertaken about three centuries earlier than van der Palm's, his access to original texts would have been very limited. Along with working from these source texts, modern biblical translators have followed the insight of related disciplines like philology, etymology and linguistics by accepting that languages change and evolve, and that the meaning of ancient texts can only be established when one document is read in the context of other texts from the same period. Van der Palm's translation is one of only a few, and certainly one of the earliest, that worked within all these criteria, thereby making it a highly scholarly document. Being the first Dutch translation carried out directly from the documents in their original languages, it was viewed by many as having special merit. In addition, he wanted the text to be readable and understandable to his contemporaries. To this end, in some parts of the text he would step away from literal translation and use a more descriptive approach.See Translation studies for an examination of this process. His hope was that this new translation would replace the Statenvertaling (Translation by the States) or Statenbijbel (States Bible) which was published first in 1637. He did not share the same trust in this translation, preferring instead the work of some 16th century translators, although he did not view their work as infallible, largely because their translations in Dutch were based on earlier translations in other languages rather than the originals. For his translation of the Old Testament van de Palm drew frequently upon the Masoretic Text - although he knew that other Hebrew texts were more reliable - and sometimes made use of the Samaritan Pentateuch (which varied in several thousand ways with the Masoretic Text ). For the New Testament he used the Received Text (Textus Receptus) and seldom departed from it. He made extensive use of footnotes to explain his translational decisions, and wrote introductions to each of the Bible books. He was also highly influenced by the King James Version because of the scholarship behind it, and the layout format employed in its printed editions (for example, he copied its layout of the Lord's Prayer). He began planning this in 1816‚Äì17 leading to the distribution of a prospectus in which he described the project and asked for financial support.The full text can be found in Beets, pp. 144-148. A quick response included the names of over two thousand people including nobility, fellow scholars and church colleagues.Beets, pp. 93-94. The first portion of the translation appeared in 1818 when he sent to that year's synod a copy with a covering letter in which he set out his objectives. Further results were sent to the synods in 1819, 1829, 1822 and 1823, and the work was completed in 1828 and 1829 after he had translated the Apocryphal books of the Old Testament. So the original estimate of three years' work had expanded out to many more. He is quoted as saying, \\"I have worked at it forty years, and eight of them like a horse.\\"Beets, p. 95 And despite all he had done earlier on the books of Isaiah, Proverbs and Psalms, his research from the 1810s onwards revealed those documents as needing even more attention. Not surprising that he would say in his correspondence with the 1829 synod, \\"After all the years of labor bestowed on the books of Solomon, I still find so much matter for new investigation that I am obliged to proceed much more slowly than I had anticipated, as I endeavor studiously to avoid all precipitation, though sometimes tempted to it.\\"Beets, p. 95. In its completed version, the translation was published in three-volumes between 1825 and 1830.Palm, Johannes van der. Bijbel bevattende alle de boeken des ouden en nieuwen verbonds. D. du Mortier & Zoon, 1825‚Äì1830. It was popular among the higher educated and middle classes, and it became commonly known as the Palmbijbel, although van der Palm considered it to be only a revision of the Statenvertaling. The Dutch Reformed Church formally adhered to use of the Statenvertaling until 1951, although it carried out updates of this text several times after the publication of the Palmbijbel. Poet and author Van der Palm was a productive, award-winning poet, who used skills that were obvious from early in his life. His father, Cornelis van der Palm, was co- founder of the Rotterdam literary society Studium scientiarum genetrixWhich means literally \\"Mother of scientific study\\", although \\"scientific\\" is not a reference to the discipline of science but takes its derivation from the Latin root scire, 'to know'. In other words, scientiarum is a reference to \\"knowledge\\" or the \\"use of knowledge\\" in any field, in the case of this society, the relationship between knowledge of literary forms and the writing of poetry and prose. However, the society's name should be precisely understood as meaning \\"The Study of the Creative Principle of Knowledge.\\" (See Frijhoff, Willem, and Marijke Spies. Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: 1800: Blueprints for a National Community. Royal van Gorcum/Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. p. 124. . which began in 1773.In 1800 this society amalgamated with similar societies in Leiden and Amsterdam to become the Bataafsche Maatschappij van Taal- en Dichtkunde (Batavian Society for Language and Literature) of which Professor Matthijs Siegenbeek was also an active member. Van der Palm joined when he was 17 and was appointed as a member of merit six years later. In 1782 the society awarded a gold medal for his poem Het Oorlog (The War).The poem was published in 1782 showing under his name the text \\"aen wien de gouden eerpenning is toegewezen\\" (\\"to whom the gold medal has been awarded\\"). (See \\"Het Oorlog\\". Accessed 5 February 2018.) By that time he was studying at Leiden University and wrote many other notable poems. For example, De verheerlijking van Christus op den berg (The Transfiguration of Christ on the Mountain) appeared in 1784, and attracted a gold medal from The Hague's poetry society Kunstliefde of which van der Palm was a member. After that time, van der Palm concentrated his work on prose writing, becoming, as van Eijnatten has described him, \\"the most prolific writer of this generation of Dutch theologians, accounting for 141 (132 + 9) published, self-authored writings\\" in the period 1760-1840.Eijnatten, Joris van. \\"The Burgess Generation: Dutch Academic Theologians and Religious Knowledge, 1760‚Äì1840.\\" Nigel Yates, Editor.

Eenige Liederen van David, vertaald en opgehelderd, door JH van der Palm (Some Songs of David) was the first major publication. It appeared in 1791 and has already been discussed (See above - 1.2.2 Movement Away from Ministry). Next came a work entitled Jesaias vertaald en opgehelderd (Isaiah translated and explained) begun in 1805 and published the following year.Palm, Johannes van der. Jesaias vertaald en opgehelderd. Bluss√© en van Braam, 1806. One of his longest projects apart from the translation of the Bible was the weekly series of essays published under the title Salomo (Solomon) which focussed on the language, meaning and moral teachings of the Old Testament book of Proverbs. Van der Palm began writing these in 1808 producing 319 before he moved onto other projects eight years later. As the output progressed, they were gathered together and published in volumes, with the first complete edition being 9 volumes.Palm, Johannes van der. Salomo, 9 Volumes. GTN Suringar, 1816. Besides his translation of the Bible with commentary notes (See above), he also wrote the Bijbel voor de JeugdOther authors have also written books under the same title. (Youth Bible), not so much a Bible as a retelling of Bible stories, the first-ever such texts designed specifically for children. In them, van der Palm set out to tell the stories in ways that would make sense to readers of that age. Portions were frequently included in newspapers, and these were frequently recommended to children by their parents. Writing of these began in 1811 and continued until 1834. Originally published and circulated in 24 parts, the earlier essays were drawn into three volumes and published in 1827.Palm, Johannes van der. Bijbel voor de Jeugd, Volumes 1-3. D. du Mortier en Zoon, 1827. Possibly his most highly regarded work was Gescheid- en redekunstig gedenkschrift van Nederlands Herstelling in den jare 1813 (Historical and rhetorical account of the emancipation of the Netherlands, in the year 1813).

Biography  Annie Krull was born in Rostock, studied in Berlin with Hertha Br√§mer, and made her stage debut in 1898 at the Plauen Stadttheater as Agathe in Der Freisch√ºtz. From 1900 to 1912, she sang at the Dresden State Opera, where in 1901 she created the title role in Paderewski's Manru and Diemut in Richard Strauss' early opera Feuersnot. Strauss, who had admired her dramatic qualities, then chose her to be the first Elektra. A year after its premiere in Dresden on 25 January 1909, she repeated the role at London's Royal Opera House. It was the first time a Strauss opera was performed in Britain. Krull sang regularly in several other German opera houses (Mannheim, Weimar, Leipzig, Cologne, Karlsruhe and Schwerin) as well as appearing in Brno (1905) and Prague (1907).

He served in the two most successful Greek submarines of the war as executive officer and captain. He died during the suppression of the Navy mutiny in April 1944.  Life  Roussen was born in Athens on 25 April 1913. After completing his studies in the Hellenic Naval Academy in 1929-1933, he was commissioned as Ensign. His first command was the torpedo boat Doris (1936‚Äì1937). He was subsequently promoted to Sub-Lieutenant and entered the Submarine School. During the Greco-Italian War, he served in the submarine Katsonis. In December 1940, he was promoted to Lieutenant. Following the German invasion and capitulation of the Army, the surviving ships of the fleet fled to Alexandria in Egypt. In the Middle East, he served aboard the armoured cruiser Averof before returning to the Katsonis as its XO. On 10 October 1942, Roussen was assigned as captain of Katsonis' sister vessel, the submarine Papanikolis. With this vessel, Roussen operated in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea, scoring a number of successes. On 30 November, Papanikolis successfully ambushed and sank an 8,000-ton cargo vessel at the Alimnia islet, near Rhodes, and on subsequent patrols in January, March and May, she captured two large schooners and sank further five. In early 1944, political tensions grew both in occupied Greece and in the Greek Armed Forces in the Middle East. As liberation drew nearer, the simmering conflict between the country's dominant resistance group, the Communist-controlled National Liberation Front (EAM), with the conservative sections of Greek society, and with the royalist Greek government in exile, erupted. In April 1944, pro-EAM demonstrations took place in several Greek units in Egypt, and the majority of the Navy's ships were commandeered by their crews. In order to quell this mutiny, the government formed special boarding detachments of reliable officers. Thus, on 22 April 1944, while leading his detachment to recover the corvette Apostolis, Roussen was mortally wounded. On 27 April, he was posthumously promoted to Captain.  Awards and honours  Roussen was awarded several decorations for his successful service as a submarine commander: the War Cross Second Class, on 5 January 1940 (as XO of the Katsonis) and again on 25 February 1943, the War Cross First Class on 30 January 1942 and again posthumously on 23 April 1944, while on 1 September 1943 he was awarded the British Distinguished Service Cross. On 27 September 1945 he was posthumously awarded the Outstanding Actions Medal for his war service. Two Hellenic Navy ships have been named after him: the landing ship Ypoploiarchos Roussen (L-164) (1958‚Äì2001),Vehicle Carrier Lieutenant Roussen L-163 (1958-2001) and the new fast attack craft Roussen (P67), the lead ship of the Roussen class, commissioned in December 2005.

The tradition and culture of the Bagvalal people is very similar to that of the Avar people, due to their common history within the Avar Khanate. Bagvalal has three dialects which are named after the names of the villages in which they are spoken in. Only the Tlisi dialect has been studied to a certain significance, because of its similarities to the Tindi language. Bagvalal has numerous loanwords from such languages as Arabic, Russian, Turkish, and Avar. It is only used as an oral language; Avar or Russian are used as written languages. Nowadays Bagvalal is only used in family settings, using Avar or Russian for every other area of communication. Bagvalal has been suffering severe problems and is in serious danger of extinction. The schooling and cultural revolution have contributed to Bagvalal's serious decline. Bagvalal pupils are taught in Avar in primary school, and in secondary school they are taught in Russian. Between 1950 and 1970, Bagvalals migrated to different districts in the Astrakhan province of Russia, and this also affected the Bagvalal language. Despite this, most of the Bagvalal are supportive towards the language, and around 30~50% of children are fluent in the language. Bagvalal was first mentioned in the 19th century, but very few recordings of the language have been made. There has been very little linguistic research done on the language.

He spied for the Soviet Union between 1929 and his death in 1933, in return for money. His job gave him access to highly sensitive communications between Britain and her foreign embassies, and the material he passed to his handler Dmitri Bystrolyotov was highly regarded in Moscow. He had no apparent ideological interest in helping the Soviet Union (unlike the more famous Cambridge spies), but was driven by the large amounts of money paid to him to betray his country. By 1933, the pressures of his activities had led to his sacking from the Foreign Office, alcoholism, domestic violence and ultimately suicide. Despite hints to there being a spy within the Foreign Office by Soviet defectors Grigory Besedovsky (in October 1929) and Georges Agabekov (in June 1930), Oldham's espionage was only partly suspected by his employers during the last months of Oldham's life, when MI5 began their investigation and surveillance. His activities were uncovered in 1940 when Oldham was identified by the Soviet defector Walter Krivitsky during his interrogations with MI5.

Visiting Rosendals Tr√§dg√•rd, one has a great opportunity to experience locally cultivated and produced phenomena and items.Rosendals Tr√§dg√•rd 73 History The area today known as Rosendals Tr√§dg√•rd was in 1817 sold to the Swedish king Karl XIV Johan (Charles XIV John of Sweden), also known as Jean Baptiste Bernadotte. Bernadotte transformed the area into an English park. In 1819, the architect Fredrik Blom constructed a royal castle linked to the area known as \\"Rosendals Tr√§dg√•rd\\". At the same time a winter garden was also built, creating an opportunity to cultivate tropical plants even during wintertime. In 1848 the Swedish king Oscar I built an orangery, where exotic plants such as palms could be explored. The one person that has been most influential in the development of Rosendals Tr√§dg√•rd is probably Queen Josefina. Queen Josefina had a great interest in gardening and made it possible for the development to take place by establishing a number of plantations and greenhouses. In 1861, Queen Josefina also collaborated with the Swedish Gardening Society, something that made it possible to start a gardening-academy in the area. Together they reformed and structured the garden and its administration after their ideal, the Royal Horticultural Society in London. All the work that was implemented during Queen Josefina's lifetime led to a development that made Rosendals Tr√§dg√•rd flourish. During the fifty years that the garden academy was up running, the garden begun its transformation towards its current structure. Though, when the Garden academy was closed and the Swedish Garden Society ended their activity in the area, Rosendal went into a period of less activity. The Royal administration of Djurg√•rden, who now owned the garden, demised the area for private practise and the garden transformed to several horticultural business garden. But in the late 1960s the Royal Administration of Djurg√•rden acceded Rosendals Tr√§dg√•rd and restored it into its former glory of Queen Josefina.Rosendals Tr√§dg√•rd 29 The Garden and its flora=The Fruit Garden= The fruit garden has, during the development of Rosendals Tr√§dg√•rd, been one of the most famous parts of the garden. Every autumn, the many different kind of apple-sorts that are represented in the almost hundred trees, becomes mature. During the Swedish Garden Society's days of glory, there were nearly 400 apple-trees in the fruit garden. During this time, Rosendals fruit garden had a big importance on the spread of fruit-trees in Sweden, since the Garden academy portioned out free plants to farmers etc. Over 24 500 fruit trees, 30 000 currant bushes, as well as 22 000 park trees was portioned out all over Sweden, something that made a greater spread of the many different apple-sorts that exist in Scandinavia possible. Other fruits, such as cherries, prunes, pears etc. are also cultivated in the fruit-garden.

All of them are planted around the orangery and most of the vines come from Baltic.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Alex Lovy. The short was released on March 9, 1968, and stars Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales. It was the penultimate cartoon in the Daffy/Speedy series, and the only one where the two are never adversaries at any point in the cartoon. Plot One night, Daffy begins sleepwalking and leaves his house, strolls past Speedy's lakeside house, then falls into the lake itself, which wakes him up. Speedy informs him that he has been sleepwalking, which worries Daffy since \\"a guy could get hurt that way.\\" Speedy offers to stay up for the night in exchange for five pesos, and promises that he will wake Daffy up if he starts sleepwalking again. Back at Daffy's house, Speedy tells him that if he notices Daffy sleepwalking, he'll ring a bell in order to wake him up. Daffy goes to sleep, but Speedy has no intention of staying up for the whole night and ties a tripwire to the bedpost, also connecting it to the bell, so that if Daffy starts sleepwalking again the bell will wake up both Daffy and Speedy. Sure enough, Daffy begins sleepwalking and trips the bell, which wakes Speedy who then starts frantically ringing it himself to make it look like he was on guard. Afterwards, Daffy goes to sleep again, though not before Speedy makes him pay another five pesos for his continued services. As dawn breaks, Daffy starts sleepwalking again, but this time he gets out of bed on the other side and leaves the house the other side of the bed, which fails to make the bell ring. He sleepwalks into a construction site, and ends up at the top of an under-construction skyscraper. In the meantime, Speedy finally wakes up and realizes that Daffy isn't there. Speedy then frantically leaves the house in pursuit. Using his super-speed, Speedy gets to the construction site, and gets to the top of the skyscraper just in time to prevent Daffy from falling down a hole in the girders. Daffy then nearly walks off the edge of the structure, but is woken up by the bell of an ice cream salesman at street level. He still loses his balance though, and falls partway down the structure, getting left hanging on for life. Speedy lowers a noose down to Daffy and threads it over his neck, then drops the other end down to Daffy and tells him to pull himself up with it. Daffy does so, nearly choking himself in the process, but manages to set off a jackhammer when he gets back to the top of the structure and is thrown off it again. On his way down, Daffy manages to grab onto the minute hand of a clock built into the side of another building, but then the hour hand starts traveling around extremely fast, whacking Daffy on the head, then the clock explodes and throws him into another building, where he bounces off the canopies above its windows. He grabs onto one of the canopies, but it quickly breaks off and drops him onto some telegraph lines, which he in turn bounces off of. Speedy manages to grab a wheelbarrow, and catches Daffy before he hits the ground. Daffy passes out during his final fall, and Speedy quickly wheels him back home and drops him back into his bed, which results in Daffy being convinced that the whole thing was just a nightmare when he wakes up.

Tromp is pictured in Roman costume. His orangist sympathies are reflected by the color of his mantle. In the history of the Dutch Republic, Orangism or prinsgezindheid (\\"pro-prince stance\\") was a political force opposing the Staatsgezinde (pro-Republic) party. Orangists supported the princes of Orange as Stadtholders (a position held by members of the House of Orange) and military commanders of the Republic, as a check on the power of the regenten. The Orangist party drew its adherents largely from traditionalists ‚Äì mostly farmers, soldiers, noblemen and orthodox Catholic and Protestant preachers, though its support fluctuated heavily over the course of the Republic's history and there were never clear-cut socioeconomic divisions. History=The coup of stadtholder Maurice against Oldenbarnevelt= Orangism can be seen as a continuation of the political opposition between the remonstrants and counter-remonstrants during the Twelve Years' Truce (1609-1621). The Remonstrants were tolerant and republican, with a liberal view on biblical interpretation, no belief in predestination and were led by men like Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius. Stadtholder Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange relied on the counter-remonstrants to oppose van Oldenbarnevelt and support his own policies, and things got so bad that civil war threatened. Oldenbarnevelt was executed after a sham trial in 1619 and Grotius sentenced to life in prison, and for a number of years the Orangists were in charge under Maurice and later his brother Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange.Israel, pp. 421-450 =First Stadtholderless Period and Orange Restoration of 1672= Orangists such as the Vice-Admiral Johan Evertsen backed the appointment of William III, Prince of Orange, the posthumously-born son of William II, Prince of Orange, to the office of stadtholder of the Holland and Zeeland. The office had been vacant since the death of William II in 1650. The pro-Republic Dutch States Party was marked by caution (especially in all matters that could harm trade), led by Grand pensionary Johan de Witt and had supporters among the ruling class, the regenten. It was de Witt who, in the 1654 peace with England and its leader Oliver Cromwell, agreed to include the secret Act of Seclusion barring the infant William III from the stadtholderate. De Witt then put pressure on all seven of the Republic's provinces to uphold this ban. The Orangist party was eventually led by the young Prince of Orange himself and by men such as Cornelis Tromp. It played an important part in the expulsion of the de Witt brothers (Cornelis de Witt and Johan de Witt), which culminated during the Rampjaar with William III's appointment as stadtholder on 28 June 1672 followed by an organised lynching of the brothers at the Gevangenpoort in the Hague on 20 August.Israel, pp. 700-739, 796-807 =Second Stadtholderless Period and Orange Restoration of 1747= After the death of William III in 1702 his Dutch ministers decided again to keep the office of stadtholder vacant, mainly because there was no clear successor available (the claim of John William Friso, Prince of Orange, a minor at this time, to the title of Prince of Orange was disputed by his cousin Frederick I of Prussia), though Friso was recognised by the States of Friesland as their stadtholder. Friso died in 1711, and his son William IV, Prince of Orange also was born posthumously. William IV was appointed stadtholder of Friesland, Groningen, and Gelderland at his majority in 1731, but the other provinces kept the office vacant, until in 1747 a popular revolt by Orangists forced the States of the other four provinces to follow suit and appoint him their stadtholder also. This was the first time that all stadtholder's offices in the Dutch Republic were in the same hand. William IV received almost dictatorial powers under the so-called Government Regulations of 1748. Hopes of democratic political reform were, however, dashed. After his early death, at age 40, in 1751, the stadtholderate (that had been declared hereditary) passed to his infant son William V, Prince of Orange, but actual power was exercised by Regents, like his mother Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange until his majority in 1766.Israel, pp. 959-968, 1067-1079 =Patriottentijd= In the second half of the 18th century the anti-Orangist party became known as the Patriots. These Patriots strongly opposed both the Prince of Orange, and the British connection. Many of their numbers were drawn from those with commercial and maritime interests who saw Britain as a natural rival of the Dutch, and generally supported the French. At various times the Princes of Orange tried to counter this by moving closer or further away from the British alliance. Events came to a head in the period 1785‚Äì1787, when most of the dictatorial powers of the stadtholder were taken away by the Patriots. However, Anglo-Prussian military intervention in the Prussian invasion of Holland of 1787 gave the upper hand to the Orangists, who drove their Patriot opponents into exile. The powers of the stadtholder were now enshrined in the so-called Act of Guarantee of 1788, and guaranteed by Britain and Prussia \\"in perpetuity.\\" Perpetuity in this case lasted seven years.Israel, 1098-1115, 1122-1127 = Batavian Republic and Exile= Following the French invasion of the Dutch Republic and the Batavian Revolution in 1795, resulting in the founding of the Batavian Republic, William V, Prince of Orange fled to Britain. At the request of the British he wrote the so-called Kew Letters, intended to hand the Dutch colonies to the British without a fight. At the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799 the young Erfprins Willem Frederik made an not-unsuccessful attempt to get the Batavian Navy to defect to the British in the Vlieter Incident. But the invasion itself was unsuccessful, because the hoped-for Orangist insurrection failed to materialize. At the Peace of Amiens of 1802 William V gave up his claims to the stadtholderate in exchange for the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda. This so discouraged his followers in the Batavian Republic that many made their peace with the new regime, and some, like Carel Hendrik Ver Huell, went over to the French emperor Napoleon completely, becoming staunch supporters of his autocratic regime, during the period 1810-1813 during which the Netherlands was annexed to the First French Empire. =Founding of the Kingdom of the Netherlands= In 1813, when the French retreated from the Netherlands, old Orangist partisans, led by Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp, managed to put the son of William V on a newly-invented throne, first of a principality, and soon of the newly-founded Kingdom of the Netherlands. Political theory The stadtholderate was never a well-defined concept in the constitution of the Dutch Republic, instead being a patchwork of responsibilities. Likewise, Orangism never became a consistent political theory. In particular, the Orangists never formulated a desire for absolute sovereignty in the hands of the princes, even though they \\"lean[ed] heavily on the concept of monarchy\\", since this would have been problematic in the Republic that wrested its independence from the kings of Spain under William of Orange. Instead, they stated their views in terms of republican liberty, sharing the idiom of their States Party opponents. Attempts to introduce elements of John Locke's natural law and Montesquieu's separation of powers (by Elie Luzac) failed when these same theories were taken over by the opposing Patriot faction in the 1780s.

It was a movement directed by William I of the Netherlands as part of his \\"Volhardingspolitiek\\" and containing most of the Belgian elites (including members of the nobility and industrialists). Some of the most prominent Flemish Orangists were Jan Frans Willems and Hippolyte Metdepenningen. Although refusing to participate in parliamentary elections, as they deemed Belgian national institutions to be illegitimate, the Orangists did take part in local elections at the provincial and municipal levels, from which they militated against the new Belgian state through political actions and an activist press. At least three Orangist coups were foiled during the 1830s. Although losing Dutch financial and political support after the Treaty of London (1839) and William I's abdication (1840), the weakening Belgian Orangism survived well into the 1850s, strongly opposing the Belgian Revolution and rallying against independence.Els Witte, Het verloren Koninkrijk, De Bezige Bij, Antwerp, 2014, p. 688 It was one inspiration for the later Greater Netherlands movement, although that movement was not all monarchist.

History The company was established in 1989 as a wholly owned subsidiary of British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) as a spin-off from BAE's corporate research and development centre in Bristol to undertake the commercialisation of laser technology derived from BAE's R&D; programmes which did not fit with the business of its main operating divisions. Products The company's first product introduction was the CAPRIS line of laser wire marking and processing systems, based on the ultraviolet laser wire marking process originally developed at BAE's laboratories in 1987, which was extended into a family of products, developed principally for the international aerospace market, for use in the manufacture and maintenance of complex aircraft electrical wiring systems. The company is the primary supplier of this technology on a global basis and has almost every major international aerospace manufacturer on its customer list. In the early 1990s, the company developed several other products, including a system used to manufacture the aluminium microwave grid array for the communications antennae for the Orion communications satellite and R&D; systems for medical applications. Ownership In March 1994, Spectrum Technologies was the subject of a management buy-out, which placed 80% of the company's equity with the management while BAE retained a 20% stake; BAE also took a royalty on Spectrum sales for a period of 10 years ending December 2004. In 1998, the company converted to Public Limited Company status, and in August 1998 its shares were introduced to the PLUS Markets in London. Awards In 1995, the company was a recipient of the Queen's Award for Export, and in 2000 won three export awards, including the Company's second Queen's Award for Enterprise for International Trade, and in 2006 won a third Queen's Award for Enterprise for International Trade.

Nyanatiloka Mahathera in 1911. It is a secluded place for Buddhist monks to study and meditate in the Buddhist tradition. It also has an excellent English and German library. The Island Hermitage was the first centre of TheravƒÅda Buddhist study and practice set up by and for Westerners. Its many prominent residents, monks and laymen, studied Theravada Buddhism and the Pali language, made translations of Pali scriptures, wrote books on Theravada Buddhism and practiced meditation. The Island Hermitage once formed an essential link with TheravƒÅda Buddhism in the West. In 1951 Nyanatiloka moved to the Forest Hermitage in Kandy, then joined by Nyanaponika. Since 2003 the hermitage is run by a group of young Sri Lankan monks. Currently there is only one western monk who has been living here for about four years.  Location  The Hermitage is located in Ratgama Lake, a salt-water lagoon about two kilometers from the coast near Dodanduwa. It is 105 kilometers south of Sri Lanka's principal city, Colombo, and about 12 kilometers north of the provincial capital, Galle. The hermitage consists of two islands: Polgasduwa and Metiduwa (or Meddeduwa ‡∂∏‡∑ê‡∂Ø‡∑ä‡∂Ø‡∑ô‡∂Ø‡∑ñ‡∑Ä ‡∑Ñ‡∑ù ‡∂∏‡∑ê‡∂ß‡∑í‡∂Ø‡∑ñ‡∑Ä). It is characterised by rich jungle vegetation and abundant bird, animal and reptile life. It is a peaceful place on an island in the large Bolgoda Lake, which is about two-and-a-half miles across and brackish as it connects with the sea. The terrain of the island is mostly flat or slightly undulating. The highest point is about 5 meters above sea level. On Metiduwa the vegetation consists of scrub and small trees such as cinnamon and bombu, with mangrove and palm trees growing along the water's edge. On the higher ground at Parapaduwa there are larger trees such as mahagoney, mango and jak. There is a noisy breeding colony of egrets, night herons and cormorants and also a colony of flying foxes. There are many mongoose and monitor lizards on the islands. Being situated an island in a lagoon, the climate is quite hot and humid, but a fully grown canopy layer of the forest provides a comfortable environment for the meditators. Bhikkhu Nyanasanta at Island Hermitage, (ca. 2006).  History  Nyanatiloka Maha Thera. Among the early Western residents were the Venerables Vappo, Mahanama, Assaji and Bhaddiya. The founder dƒÅyaka (lay supporter) was William Mendis Wijesekera. He and other lay supporters from around Dodanduwa conveyed alms-food and other requisites to the hermitage by boat every morning. In 1913 a dƒÅnasƒÅla (refectory) was constructed. It was not until 1914 that the Island Polgasduwa actually came into the legal possession of the Sangha, when it was bought and donated by Ven. Nyanatiloka's Swiss supporter, Monsieur Bergier. Since that time, though interrupted by two world wars, Western as well as Sinhalese monks and laymen have lived, studied, practiced, and spread the Dhamma from the Island Hermitage. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the German monks were first permitted to stay at the Island Hermitage under surveillance. However, after four months, they were taken into civil internment in Sri Lanka and then sent to Australia. When Ven. Nyanatiloka was finally able to return to Sri Lanka in 1926, he found his beloved Island Hermitage in utter ruin and had to rebuild it anew. As soon as the restoration was completed and the hermitage was making progress again, the Second World War broke out in 1939. Ven. Nyanatiloka and his German disciples were again interned in camps, first in Sri Lanka and then in India. They were allowed to return in 1946. This time the Hermitage remained in a well preserved and in an even improved condition. It now included the adjacent small island of Metiduwa which had already been used for some time but was now officially donated by Lady Evadne de Silva, a long-time supporter of Ven. Nyanatiloka. A detailed account of the history of the Island Hermitage and the monks who lived on it can be found in The Life of Nyanatiloka Thera: The Biography of a Western Buddhist Pioneer, Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, Kandy 2008.  Chapter House or Sƒ´mƒÅ  The chapter house which is built on lake is the place where the community of monks, particularly gather to listen PƒÅtimokkha recitation on a fortnightly basis as well as to perform other monastic procedures as the need arises. Chapter hall at Island Hermitage Inauguration of the newly built Sƒ´mƒÅ or Chapter hall at the Island Hermitage.  Life Style  All the monastics at the Island Hermitage practice walking for alms on a daily basis except for the full moon day when they are fed by devotees who come to observe precepts.  Visiting  Tourists and short term visitors are not allowed to visit the hermitage. Long term visitors, i.e. those who like to stay at least two or three weeks, need to write in advance.  Wildlife  There is hardly any danger on the island from animals. There are no elephants, tigers or dragons. However, do not walk outside at night without a light - even in front of the kuti. Centipede stings can cause severe pain. There are some snakes (most of them already digested by the mongooses). The iguanas (big lizards / small Dinosaurs) keep discreetly to themselves, but are capable of whipping you with their tails if you chance to step over one lying on the path.  Library  The library at the Island Hermitage is a large Buddhist library based on a wide variety of Buddhist and non-Buddhist collections, books suitable for study for those living within a forest monastic environment. One of the most notable aspects of the library is that it has amassed a collection of the PƒÅli Canon in six different scripts i.e. Sinhalese, Thai, Burmese, Devanagari, Roman and German. Rehoused library at the Island HermitageIts core collection lies in the areas of reference works such as encyclopedias of Buddhism, creative works, manuscripts, periodical publications including magazines, journals and books and other historical reports regarding resident monks etc. Therefore, Island Hermitage library can be seen as a place where a beginner to Buddhism can read about the basics and a scholar can carry out his research. Over the course of its history, the library‚Äôs collection has grown to include a proliferation of books on all subjects. There seems to have been an effective record-keeping practice that ensured the growth of the library by late Western monks who lived here. Unfortunately, many collections of records are believed to have been destroyed over the years due to poor maintenance. Almost all the items in the library have not been digitized and are only available in physical form. The Island Hermitage library was long housed in the main building of the monastery, but in 2016 repairs to the damaged building were successfully carried out in order to protect and unify its vast collection. As of 2018, the library has been rehoused in an air-conditioned room and opened for both local and foreign monks and laity to carry out their researches.  Swimming  It is not advisable to swim. If you really want to, do not swallow the water. Be particularly cautious of Oyster-shells which can cut the feet when walking in or out of the water. If an iguana (Kabara Goya in Sinhalese) is nearby, swim very quietly without moving the water too much (breast-stroke is the best) to the shore and get out. They are known to bite swimmers.

Bindings of the books are not removed and the books are scanned non-intrusively two pages at a time for the purpose of converting into digital ebook files later.

The flesh of these pigs is essential in most Extremaduran dishes. Extremadura, Spain is known for its different ways of preparing the Iberian pork and mutton. The main characteristics of the traditional Extremaduran cuisine were its simplicity, its lack of clutter and its low cost. It is also a cuisine reflecting a generous spirit, for many of its preparations used to be cooked in large pots to share with visitors, friends, and neighbors. The resulting dishes are eaten with local bread. The preferred spices in Extremaduran cuisine are paprika (piment√≥n), garlic, bay leaves, pennyroyal, and anise. The Northeastern comarca of La Vera produces piment√≥n de la Vera, smoked paprika highly valued all over Spain and extensively used in Extremaduran cuisine. Olive oil is used for frying and as an ingredient in many dishes. Maybe due to Portuguese influence, some limited use of coriander leaves (unusual for other regions of mainland Spain outside the Canary Islands) can be found for some specific dishes such as rep√°palos or pickled cod (escabeche de bacalao), though often with the possibility of using parsley as an alternative and not with the same extensive use as in Portugal. Wine is produced mainly in the territory of the Ribera del Guadiana denominaci√≥n de origen. The region is also known for its vino de pitarra tradition, home-made wine made in small earthenware vessels. The Jerte Valley is known for its cherry production, especially in the local picota del Jerte variety, highly regarded all over Spain and with a denominaci√≥n de origen.https://cerezadeljerte.org/en/jerte-cherrys/ Representative dishes The chickpea is an important Extremaduran staple. Traditionally Extremaduran children loved to eat green chick peas straight out of the pods. Among the pork or mutton-based dishes, some well-known ones are the callos con manos de cerdo (tripe with pig's feet), caldereta de cordero (mutton stew), cabrito en cuchifrito, frite de cordero (mutton fry) and the cabrito a la hortelana (kid and vegetable stew).Gastronomia de las Hurdes The chanfaina in Extremadura has nothing to do with similarly named dishes in the Iberian Peninsula, like the Catalan Xanfaina, which is a Spanish version of the Occitan Ratatouille, and which would be considered a kind of pisto in Extremadura. The Extremaduran chanfaina is a rich stew of mutton liver, brain, heart, and kidneys cooked with a mixture of bay leaves, garlic, bread crumbs and boiled eggs. Traditional Extremaduran gastronomy includes other meats, like hen (gallina), which is one of the main ingredients of the emblematic cocido extreme√±o stew, hare arroz con liebre (rice with hare) and frogs ancas de ranas fritas (fried frog legs). It also includes local fishes like the tench tencas fritas (fried tenches) and trout truchas con jam√≥n (trout with ham), and even a certain large lizard usually prepared in guisado, made by frying slices of lizard in olive oil, after which they were stewed over a slow fire.Lorenzo D√≠az, (2001), Los sabores perdidos, Ed. Edaf. pag. 178 Gastronomia extreme√±aLos h√°bitos culinarios en el pasado extreme√±o In spite of being eaten in a variety of preparations and even served at restaurants in the past, also including entomat√° de lagarto (lizard in tomato sauce ) or lagarto en salsa verde (lizard in green sauce ), currently lizards are a protected species and trapping them is prohibited. Concerning fish, some cod preparations are known, and tench is among the most traditional freshwater fish, including fish and vegetable dishes such as moje de peces or escarapuche. Among the basic popular dishes the ones based on chick peas are dominant. Other main ingredients are habichuelas (beans), potatoes, pumpkin, chestnuts, onions and bell peppers. Some famous dishes of Extremadura are the cocido extreme√±o, the potaje de garbanzos y jud√≠as blancas (chick pea and bean soup), the sopa blanca de ajos (white garlic soup), the potaje de casta√±as secas (chestnut soup), the olla con \\"asaura\\" (a stew with offal and blood), and the gazpacho extreme√±o (variants of gazpacho, sometimes with ham or pennyroyal mint). Soups often have a stale bread base and include a variety of both hot and cold ones, such as sopa de ajo, sopa de tomate (bread-based soup with tomato, peppers and egg), sopa de poleo (pennyroyal mint soup), sopa de pan con aceitunas (bread soup with olives), sopa de esp√°rragos trigueros (wild asparagus soup), sopa de antruejo (bread based soup with a lot of pork meat), sopa de habas (broadbean soup) and such. It is traditional to eat such soups having figs at the same time as a side dish, or even grapes. Sopas canas include at least milk, bread and garlic as a base. Pennyroyal mint is sometimes used to season gazpachos or soups such as sopa de poleo. Extremaduran ajoblanco (ajoblanco extreme√±o) is a cold soup different from Andalusian ajoblanco since it contains egg yolk in the emulsion and it may contain vegetables such as tomatoes but no almonds. Though rice is not as common as in some other Spanish regions, rice dishes with rabbit meat or pork are common, including arroz a la cacere√±a from C√°ceres, which, after being cooked, is then covered in a crust of egg and cheese and then baked, in a way similar to Valencian arroz con costra. Vegetables are found in many dishes, even if there is very little in the way of actual vegetarian dishes in the traditional cuisine. Still, apart from gazpachos, salads similar to Andalusian pipirrana (with a variety of local names such as picadillo, cojondongo or rinr√°n https://lacomidatipica.com/platos-tipicos-merida/) are popular, as well as zorongollo, a salad made with tomato and roast peppers reminiscent of Catalan escalivada. As in La Mancha and Murcia, pisto is a traditional dish. Local tomato sauce is often known as tomat√° or entomat√° and it can be an accompaniment to many dishes. Desert truffles, locally named criadillas or criadillas de tierra, are eaten with scrambled eggs (revuelto de criadillas ), fried with other ingredients or as an accompaniment in other dishes. Even if many other mushroom species grow in Extremadura and they have some culinary use nowadays, only a few other mushroom species apart from desert truffles were actually traditionally consumed, such as Amanita ponderosa (called gurumelo, especially popular in Southern Extremadura) or Macrolepiota procera. Some of the ancestral dishes of Extremadura are today less commonly eaten, like the migas (such as migas con torreznos) and the gachas.Saber Popular - Revista extreme√±a de folklore n¬∫23 Vegetables like cardoon and borage were traditionally widely used in soups. Certain dishes of the Extremaduran cuisine show the influence of neighboring Portugal, like the lentejas estofadas (stewed lentils) and the sopa de perdices (partridge soup). Embutidos and pork products Extremadura's Black Iberian pigs are usually left to roam in relative freedom and their main diet are the acorns falling from the local oak trees. This breed of pig is found exclusively in Southwestern Iberia, both in Spain and Portugal. Their meat is highly valued throughout Spain, especially their ham. Extremaduran cuisine is abundant in pork; it is said that the region is one of the best for breeding pigs in Spain, thanks to the acorns that grow in its dehesas. Some Extremaduran embutidos (pork preserves and sausages) have a local flavor, like the morcilla ¬´Felisa¬ª (based on blood and onion), morcillas de cabez√° (head innards morcillas), morcillas patateras (sausage containing mashed potato and pork fat and meat seasoned with paprika and garlic), as well as sausages prepared with pumpkin (morcilla de calabaza). Dry-cured pork products include chacinas and the local ham, longaniza, chorizo, salchich√≥n, morc√≥n and ca√±a de lomo. Pork embutidos and other pieces of pork meat are often added to local stews such as cocido. Cachuela (sometimes also known as \\"caldillo\\") is a fatty pork liver p√¢t√© seasoned with paprika, garlic and other spices. Buche is a kind of embutido similar to Leonese botillo made from different pieces left over from the butchering of a pig, including the ribs, tail, and bones with a little meat left on them, which are chopped, seasoned and then stuffed into the cecum of the pig. Once cured, it's usually boiled and then it is opened to extract its content in order to eat it, usually as \\"coles con buche\\", accompanied by other pork products and separate dishes of rice and cabbage cooked in the same broth produced by boiling the buche. Cheeses The region is home to a variety of cheeses, those most well known being Torta del Casar, produced in Casar de C√°ceres and surrounding area, and Torta de la Serena, produced in the comarca of la Serena. Both have a denominaci√≥n de origen and both are sheep milk cheeses that are curdled using a coagulant found in the pistils of cardoon (Cynara cardunculus), which gives a creamy consistency and a rich taste with a light bitterness. These cheeses are traditionally eaten by slicing off the top and scooping out the inside with a spoon, then spreading it on bread. They're somewhat similar to Serra da Estrela cheese in Portugal. Queso de los Ibores is another cheese with a denominaci√≥n de origen, made in the comarcas of los Ibores, Villuercas, La Jara and Trujillo in the southeast of the Province of C√°ceres. It is a fatty goat milk cheese made exclusively from the milk of Serrana, Verata, Retinta breeds and crosses between them and only from farms registered with the regulatory council. A variety of goat milk cheeses found along the border with Portugal are similar to goat milk cheeses found in neighboring Portuguese areas and have a compact consistency and a strong taste and smell, such as Quesa√≠lla cheese, as well as queso de Aceh√∫che and queso de Gata-Hurdes. Desserts and sweets Extremaduran desserts and sweets are mostly prepared using the local wheat flour, honey, pork fat, milk, sugar and olive oil. Some of them are the bu√±uelos, magdalenas (anise-parfumed muffins), perrunillas, galletas, rosquillas de vino, roscas fritas (fried doughnuts), coquillos de miel, rep√°palos dulces, sopa de almendras (sweet almond soup), ga√±otes, hornazos dulces, roscas de mu√©gado (or roscas de pi√±onate), hijuelas, gachas extreme√±as (or \\"puchas dulces\\"), bollos fritos (fried buns), floretas, socochones hurdanos and the jeringas. .Gastronomia de Extremadura, Revista Alc√°ntara. n¬∫ 56 Some well known local specialties are t√©cula-m√©cula from Olivenza, bollo turco from Jerez de los Caballeros and roscas de alfajor from Casar de C√°ceres.

History At the outset of their operations in 1889, the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Electric Supply Company (NESCo) were confined to operating within the eastern half of Newcastle. Their initial objective was to supply electricity for \\"4,500 ten candle-power lamps, of which 3,000 could be alight at one time.\\" NESCo's first major step toward achieving this goal was the erection of their first power station, at Pandon Dene in the city's east end. The station was opened in 1890. Charles Merz worked at the station in 1892, prior to becoming a founder of his own electrical engineering consultancy Merz & McLellan. Design and specification Upon opening, the station generated electricity using two 75 kilowatts (kW) Mordey alternators, each driven by a conventional Robey steam engine, meaning the alternators operated at a slow speed. This gave the station an initial generating capacity of 150 kW. The Mordey generators could not operate in parallel and so each time load was transferred from one machine to another, supply would be interrupted and customers would notice a distinct flicker in the lights. The station burned 2,700 tonnes of coal per year, all of which was delivered by horse and cart. The electricity generated was supplied almost entirely for lighting purposes, and was generated at a pressure of 2,000 Volts, and distributed using house-to-house transformers which reduced the pressure to 100 Volts. Later in the station's history, further generators were installed, the largest of which had a capacity of 500 kW. Closure The station closed in 1902, following the opening of Neptune Bank Power Station in Wallsend, and was subsequently converted into a sub- station with motor-generators. The sub-station used four 800 kW rotary converters. It was one of five sub-stations which provided electricity for the North Eastern Railway's Riverside Branch.

History Until its independence in 1951, Libya had been a colony of Italy (1912‚Äì1947) and then under British and French occupation until 1951. In 1949 The UN General Assembly had passed a resolution stating that Libya should become independent before January 1, 1952 (Resolution 289). On December 24, 1951, Libya declared its independence under King Idris. The United States recognized the Kingdom of Libya on December 24, 1951, in a congratulatory message sent by President Harry Truman to King Idris I. Diplomatic relations were established on the same day and the U.S. Consulate-General was elevated to a legation with Andrew Lynch designated as Charge d'Affaires ad interim. The first official envoy to Libya was Henry Serrano Villard, who presented his credentials on March 6, 1952. On December 2, 1979, a mob attacked and burned the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. On December 29, the U.S. Department of State designated Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism. The Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires was recalled on February 8, 1980 and the embassy was closed May 2, 1980. However, diplomatic relations were not formally severed. Diplomatic relations were not resumed until 2006. The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli was closed and all diplomatic personnel were evacuated on February 25, 2011, due to the Libyan civil war. The embassy of Hungary in Tripoli acted as the protecting power for U.S. interests from the closure of the embassy until its reopening on September 22, 2011. On July 15, U.S. Secretary of State Clinton announced that the U.S. Government recognizes the Libyan rebel National Transitional Council as the \\"legitimate governing authority\\" of Libya‚Äîwhich de facto withdraws recognition from the Gaddafi government. On September 12, 2012 the US ambassador to Libya was killed in an attack on the Benghazi consulate, along with three other embassy employees. The U.S Embassy was again evacuated and closed on July 26, 2014. Embassy staff totaling approximately 150 personnel, including about 80 U.S Marines, were evacuated overland to Tunisia during a military assisted departure. USAF F-16's provided armed overwatch for the embassy convoy as they drove through Libya. The evacuation was due to major fighting around the embassy related to the 2014 Libyan Civil War.

Uniacke was named a lieutenant in the militia in 1796. He was called to the Nova Scotia bar and then went to London, where he studied at Lincoln‚Äôs Inn and was called to the English bar. He was named Attorney General of Lower Canada in 1809. Governor James Henry Craig, who opposed Uniacke's appointment, suspended him from that post in 1810. Uniacke resumed his duties in 1812 after Craig was replaced by George Pr√©vost. In 1825, he was named a judge in the Court of King's Bench for Montreal district. He served a judge for Trois-Rivi√®res district in 1827 during the absence of Pierre-Stanislas B√©dard. Uniacke also served as justice of the peace. He married Sophie Delesdernier in 1829.

This concept can be generalized to curves defined over fields other than mathbb{C} (or even schemes), because the local ring at a smooth point P of an algebraic curve C (defined over an algebraically closed field) is always a discrete valuation ring.J. H. Silverman (1986). The arithmetic of elliptic curves. Springer. p. 21 This valuation will endow us with a way to count the order (at the point P) of rational functions (which are natural generalizations for meromorphic functions in the non-complex realm) having a zero or a pole at P. Local parameters, as its name indicates, are used mainly to properly count multiplicities in a local way. Introduction When C is a complex algebraic curve, we know how to count multiplicities of zeroes and poles of meromorphic functions defined on it.R. Miranda (1995). Algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces. American Mathematical Society. p. 26 However, when discussing curves defined over fields other than mathbb{C}, we do not have access to the power of the complex analysis, and a replacement must be found in order to define multiplicities of zeroes and poles of rational functions defined on such curves. In this last case, we say that the germ of the regular function f vanishes at Pin C if fin m_Psubsetmathcal{O}_{C,P}. This is in complete analogy with the complex case, in which the maximal ideal of the local ring at a point P is actually conformed by the germs of holomorphic functions vanishing at P. Now, the valuation function on mathcal{O}_{C,P} is given by :operatorname{ord}_P(f)=max{d=0,1,2,ldots: fin m^d_P}; this valuation can naturally be extended to K(C) (which is the field of rational functions of C) because it is the field of fractions of mathcal{O}_{C,P}. Hence the idea of having a simple zero at a point P is now complete: it will be a rational function fin K(C) such that its germ falls into m_P^d, with d at most 1. This has an algebraic resemblance with the concept of a uniformizing parameter (or just uniformizer) found in the context of discrete valuation rings in commutative algebra; a uniformizing parameter for the DVR (R, m) is just a generator of the maximal ideal m. The link comes from the fact that a local parameter at P will be a uniformizing parameter for the DVR (mathcal{O}_{C,P}, m_P), whence the name. Definition Let C be an algebraic curve defined over an algebraically closed field K, and let K(C) be the field of rational functions of C. The valuation on K(C) corresponding to a smooth point Pin C is defined as operatorname{ord}_P(f/g)=operatorname{ord}_P(f)-operatorname{ord}_P(g), where operatorname{ord}_P is the usual valuation on the local ring (mathcal{O}_{C,P}, m_P). A local parameter for C at P is a function tin K(C) such that operatorname{ord}_P(t)=1.

Life and work  Kemp was born in Youngstown, Ohio, the only son of a candymaker. He was raised by his grandmother, in a house by the local train yards. At the age of seventeen he left home to become a common seaman; after returning to the United States he traveled across the country by riding the rails as a hobo. He later attended the University of Kansas, and while a student he began publishing verse in newspapers and magazines. He spent much of his maturity traveling; he stayed in a number of planned communities for varying lengths of time, then wrote autobiographical novels about his experiences.Charles Pierce LeWarne, Utopias on Puget Sound, 1885‚Äì1915, Seattle, University of Washington Press, 1975; p. 199.

Page 100, \\"The reception of these texts was mixed. Harry Kemp's Tramping on Life, published in 1922, received exceptionally good reviews and sold very well, but few others had the same success.\\" When not traveling he was a regular denizen of Greenwich Village in New York City and Provincetown on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, where he was associated with the Provincetown Players. There is a street named for him, Harry Kemp Way, in Provincetown. Harry Kemp was also known as the \\"poet of the dunes.\\" Kemp lived on and off in a shack in the dunes of Provincetown, Cape Cod for a period of about 40 years, and he died there in 1960. A 1934 Kemp poem titled, \\"The Last Return,\\" was written for the Coast Guard men who steadfastly worked to save the lives of those shipwrecked on Cape Cod's coast. Kemp had a knack for self-promotion, what he called \\"the Art of Spectacularism,\\"Wetzsteon, p. 335. and early learned to collaborate with and manipulate journalists to attract attention to his work. He spent time in Paris in the early 1920s, along with the more famous members of the Lost Generation. Kemp knew many of the bohemian and progressive literary and cultural figures of his generation, including Elbert Hubbard, Upton Sinclair, Ida Tarbell, Bernarr MacFadden, Sinclair Lewis, Max Eastman, Eugene O'Neill, Edmund Wilson, John Dos Passos, E. E. Cummings, and many others.Wetzsteon, pp. 60, 119, 138, 166, 190 and ff. Kemp played a role in the first stage production of O'Neill's earliest play, Bound East for Cardiff. Kemp was physically imposing, \\"Tall, broad-shouldered, and robust,\\"Wetzsteon, p. 334. and gained a reputation as a lover, sometimes of other men's wives; he was involved in various scandals throughout his career. His part in Upton Sinclair's divorce was especially notorious in its day.William Brevda, \\"Love's Coming-of-Age: The Upton Sinclair‚ÄìHarry Kemp Divorce Scandal,\\" North Dakota Quarterly Vol. 51 No. 2 (Spring 1983), pp. 59-77. In addition to his original books, Kemp translated a play by Tirso de Molina as The Love-Rogue (1923), and edited The Bronze Treasury (1927), \\"an anthology of 81 obscure English poets.\\" Kemp's views turned somewhat more conservative with age; he rejected leftist and anarchist sympathies and wrote approvingly of Jesus as the \\"divine hobo\\" and the \\"super tramp.\\" Kemp's reputation had declined into obscurity by the time of his death in 1960.  Critical opinion  According to Louis Untermeyer (editor of Modern American Poetry), Kemp's early collections (The Cry of Youth, The Passing God) are \\"full of every kind of poetry except the kind one might imagine Kemp would write. Instead of crude and boisterous verse, here is precise and over-polished poetry.\\" Untermeyer's opinion was that Chanteys and Ballads is \\"riper,\\" with \\"the sense of personality more pronounced.\\"Louis Untermeyer, ed., Modern American Poetry, Fourth Revised Edition, New York, Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1930; p. 376.

ECPod stands for \\"English Chinese Podcast\\" where members come together to post home videos of themselves teaching English and Chinese. At the early stage, ECPod was paying a rate of USD1.20 or RMB10 per video clip for members to upload their videos. Response was overwhelming and after just 2 months, ECPod had to stop paying for videos due to budget constraint. However, membership swelled to 5,000 by August 2007 and members continue to upload home-made videos for no pay as the community grew stronger. By December 2007, membership reached 20,000 and members started to experience a slowdown in server response time when using the website. This is due to lack of bandwidth for users outside of Hong Kong. The founders of ECPod started to look for potential investors in early 2008 and managed to attract a private angel investor in Hong Kong. ECPod received its first investment of US$150,000 in March 2008. From the period of April 2008 to May 2008, ECPod ran a survey with its members to see what new features are required for an initiative to redevelop the website beyond a language learning portal. With the survey results and the investment money, ECPod contracted a team of 4 programmers from VHost Network and 1 web designer in Hong Kong to start the development of ECPod phase II. The web designer was a 15-year-old high school student Warren Hui from South Island School, Hong Kong. The new Phase II development of ECPod uses AJAX (programming) techniques and is geared towards a platform to connect China and the world ‚Äì beyond language exchange.

It houses various state organs such as the State Great Khural and offices of its members, as well as the offices of the President and Prime Minister. It is sometimes referred to by Ulaanbaatar residents as the \\"Saaral Ordon,\\" or \\"Gray Palace\\" in the Mongolian language due to the exterior's former color (it was painted white in 2007). History 19th-century painting of Ikh Kh√ºree Main entrance to the Palace (North side) the large scale statue of Genghis Khan The grounds of the present day Government Palace and S√ºkhbaatar Square were largely occupied by the monastery of Ikh Kh√ºree, the central temple-palace complex of the city up until the early part of the 20th century. The monastery was established in 1639 and was a moveable site that changed location nearly thirty times before finally settling in present-day Ulaanbaatar in 1855. It was famous for its high-level monastic education, ten monastic schools, numerous temples, 15 000 lamas, thirty lama districts, spectacular religious festivals, and wealthy treasuries. Originally called Z√º√ºn Kh√ºree (East Monastery), the complex was the largest and oldest section of what was to become Ulaanbaatar. The monastery had a large open area (later the main city square) which was surrounded on all sides by temples, residences of the nobility and clergy as well as the Baruun Damnuurchin market. Here, Mongolian wrestling and Tsam dances took place in the presence of nobles and clergy. Later, the area became a dumping ground for refuse that the Bogd Khan would pass on his royal procession to the Yellow Palace. Following the Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921, the garbage was cleared and a Green Domed Theater was built on the site in 1926. The adjoining Ikh Kh√ºree Monastery was completely destroyed by the country's communist regime in the 1930s as part of large scale persecutions of the Buddhist Church. Today only a couple of old temples recall the beauty of the old city. The Green Domed Theater burned to the ground unexpectedly in 1949. In 1946 construction of S√ºkhbaatar Square began with a statue of the revolutionary leader Damdiny S√ºkhbaatar. Mongolia's supreme leader Marshal Choibalsan participated as a simple worker digging out the marker on the spot chosen for Sukhbaatar's statue. After the destruction of the Green Domed Theater, Choibalsan ordered the construction of the Government Palace on its site in 1951. After Choibalsan's death in 1952 party leaders had a mausoleum similar to Vladimir Lenin's in Moscow built at the Palace's south face to hold the remains of S√ºkhbaatar and Choibalsan. Completed in 1954, S√ºkhbaatar's Mausoleum served as the viewing platform for party leaders and high ranking government officials during national day and May 1 parades every year until the Democratic Revolution of 1990. In 2005-2006 S√ºkhbaatar's Mausoleum was torn down as part of extensive renovations to the palace and replaced by a grand colonnade monument to Genghis Khan, √ñgedei Khan, and Kublai Khan, completed in 2006 in time for the 800-year anniversary of Genghis Khan's coronation.

The British and Austrians under the Duke of York defeated a French advance northwards from Cambrai commanded by Ren√© Chapuis. Background In April 1794 the Dutch States Army under William, Hereditary Prince of Orange lay besieging the French-held fortress of Landrecies, covered by a field army that stretched in a semi-circle from Maroilles in the east through Catillon-sur- Sambre in the south to Le Cateau-Cambr√©sis on the west. The right wing at Le Cateau was under the command of the Prince Frederick, Duke of York. The French Army of the North commanded by Jean-Charles Pichegru had been greatly bolstered during the winter by new recruits thanks to the Levee en Masse instigated the previous year by the Revolutionary government. With the situation for Landrecies critical, Pichegru launched a multi-pronged relief attempt against the besieging army. Three French divisions were involved in the offensive. In the east Louis Charbonnier was ordered to advance with 30,000 men against the opposing forces of Franz Wenzel, Graf von Kaunitz- Rietberg. Jacques Ferrand was to advance from Guise with 45,000 troops to attack the east and south of the covering force. From Cambrai, Ren√©-Bernard Chapuy with 30,000 soldiers would attack the British under the Duke of York at the western end of the line. The attacks were all launched simultaneously on 26 April but were uncoordinated. In the east 22,000 of Charbonnier's men under Jacques Fromentin attacked the Allied positions at Maroilles and Prisches and after a long struggle captured Prisches, severing communications between J√≥zsef Alvinczi to the north and Franz Joseph, Count Kinsky to the south. Alvinczi was wounded twice and command devolved upon the youthful Archduke Charles who led a counterattack which recovered ground and drove the French over the Little Helpe. To the south, Count Heinrich von Bellegarde defending the line from Oisy to Nouvion was attacked by 23,000 French troops. But the victory at Prisches enabled the Archduke to send troops to his aid and this attack too was repulsed.Fortescue p.307 In this action, Antoine Balland's division was routed. Battle Troops attached to the command of General Chapuis had already clashed with the Duke of York two days earlier, when a column had been repulsed with great loss by just 4 squadrons of light cavalry under Rudolf Ritter von Otto at Villers-en-Cauchies, now however Chapuis was advancing with all his force. Chapuis left Cambrai with nearly 30,000 men in two columns consisting of the Cambrai garrison and part of Goguet's Division Phipps I p.287 and advanced towards Le Cateau through a thick morning fog. The larger column moved directly along the high road from Cambrai to Le Cateau, a smaller 4,000 strong second column moved parallel two miles to the south through the villages of Ligny-en-Cambr√©sis and Bertry. Before him the British lines were strung out across a ridge running south and facing Inchy, Troisvilles and Bertry. Suddenly the sound of musketry signaled the arrival of French columns looming out of the mist, and the allied advanced posts fell back in confusion through the village of Troisvilles. The French then deployed slowly and awkwardly while the alarm was raised, with the southern column moving to its left to join the battle near Troisvilles. For about two hours the French manoeuvered ineffectively in front of the British position while York's command planned a counter-move.Burne p.130 York came galloping up from Le Cateau and took station on the ridge (either in a redoubt or at a mill, accounts differ), and was presently joined by Otto. As the fog lifted one of them (probably YorkBurne p.128 \\"It is probably right to say that while Otto delivered the blow that was now to be struck, York planned it\\") noticed that the French left was exposed 'in the air' and vulnerable to an outflanking movement. Orders were given to assemble a huge force of 18 squadrons of Austrian and British cavalry unseen on the right flank in a hidden fold between Inchy and Bethencourt to attempt to roll up the French left wing. York repeated tactics that had worked well for him at the action at Vaux the previous week. While the turning force was assembling under Otto, the artillery under Sir William Congreve were ordered to keep up a regular fire to the front in order to draw French attention in that direction. Light troops were sent to engage the French left.Fortescue p.308 Just before the attack began York ordered his light troops in front of Troisvilles to fall back through the village, which further encouraged the French infantry to follow up triumphantly. Otto's flanking cavalry meanwhile were drawn up in three lines, the first consisting of six squadrons of Zeschwitz Cuirasiers (Austrian) under Prince Schwarzenberg, the second line of John Mansel's Dragoon brigade (i.e. 2 squadrons each of the Blues, the Royals and the 3rd Dragoon Guards)(British), and the third line of the 1st and 5th Dragoon Guards plus the 16th Light Dragoons (British). Two days earlier Mansel's brigade had failed to support Otto at Villers-en-Cauchies, apparently due to a communication error, however although Mansel was officially cleared of responsibility a cloud nevertheless hung over the brigade, which was eager to redeem its honour. Before the attack York rode up to the head of the brigade, reminding it how he was 'displeased' with its conduct two days previously, but had every confidence it would 'regain its credit'.York's report, quoted in Burne p.131 The Charge In this order Otto's command moved off cautiously, taking advantage of dips and hollows in the topography to conceal their movement, until they reached a hollow about half a mile west of Beaumont just north of the high road. Before them lay more than 20,000 infantry serenely facing eastward unaware of the storm about to burst on them from the north. At the last minute Chapuis spotted the force and hurried two battalions and a few guns to ward off the blow, but it was too little, too late. Otto's cavalry swept down from the north taking the French completely by surprise. The first enemy they came against was a body of cavalry with Chapuis himself at their head. He was promptly taken prisoner and the cavalry scattered. With wild cheering the allied cavalry whirled down upon the left and rear of the French. Artillery and infantry hastily wheeled about to face the charge with canister and musketry, but made little impact on the avalanche of cavalry, which swept through the French ranks from left to right, sabres flashing. \\"We could observe from the camp several of our squadrons charging through the French cavalry, then through the French infantry, after which they would wheel round, and charge back again in the same manner, so that it was impossible for the enemy to rally or collect their terrified troops\\"Brown p.124 Within a few minutes the French command was a confused mass of fleeing men. Death of Mansel The British cavalry had surpassed itself, and none more so than John Mansel's brigade. Mansel, stung by the imputation of cowardice, had sworn he would not come back alive,Fortescue p.309 dashing far ahead of his men he was cut down in the midst of the French ranks. However exact accounts of his death vary. It seems he survived the first charge and was recorded as later engaged against the French rear near Ligny Sources describe him variously as killed by grapeshot (i.e.canister), struck down by three wounds, lying naked in a ditch with his throat cutCombermere Vol I p.36cited in Burne p.130 or beheaded by a cannonballHarcourt V p.430, cited in Burne p.130 York's report says \\"Some time after the affair was over his body was found by some of the Skirmishers considerably in front of the main body of the Cavalry with a musket shot through the breast and the throat cut. His epaulets were cut off and his pockets rifled. His son likewise who was a very fine lad is missing and no tidings whatsoever have been heard of him\\" York, quoted in Burne p.132 Mansel's son had in fact been taken prisoner by the retreating French. French Retreat Aside from the destruction of the main French column, a detachment that had been pushed forward to Troisvilles was driven back by two guns commanded by Congreve and joined the rest of the rout. Meanwhile, the 4,000 strong southern column had advanced beyond Maurois with its artillery, but on encountering the fugitives began to retire in good order. This was spotted by Major Stepheicz with two squadrons of the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Hussars and four of the British 7th and 11th Light Dragoons, who followed up and drove the rearguard back onto the main body to the west of Maretz. A few miles further on he came up with the main body and completely dispersed it, capturing 10 guns.Fortescue p.310 In this part of the field alone 1200 were reported killed. Chapuis' command was pursued by a wide detour all the way to the gates of Cambrai. Mansel's son, taken prisoner by the retreating French as he tried to save his father's life was later exchanged and declared that during the battle \\"there was not, on the 26th, a single French soldier left in the town\\" as Chapuis had drawn out the whole garrison of Cambrai to support the attack on Inchy. Had this been known at the time a detachment could easily have walked into Cambrai as the French retreated by a very circuitous routeOfficer of the Guards Vol 2 p.34 Conclusion Otto's charge claimed to have killed 2,000 and captured 350 plus capturing 22 guns. It was estimated that the total losses of the Republicans on this day were 41 guns and 7,000 killed, wounded and missing. In addition when Chapuis was captured Pichegru's orders for the campaign were found in his pocket. In Otto's command the Austrians reported a loss of 9 officers, 228 men and 208 horses, the British six officers, 156 men and 289 horses killed, wounded and missing. The overall Allied loss was just under 1,500 men.Fortescue p.311 Assessment Fortescue describes this action as \\"the greatest day in the annals of the British horse\\". The French historian Coutanceau offers this tribute: \\"The decisive day of the campaign: it shows an army immobilized in front of a fortress, being out-manoeuvred and turned by an active and enterprising enemy, propelled by the invincible spirit of the offensive.\\"Coutanceau II p.409 ReferencesBibliography * Fortescue, Sir John British Campaigns in Flanders 1690-1794 (extracts from Volume 4 of A History of the British Army) (London: Macmillan) (1918). * Alfred H Burne The Noble Duke of York (Staples Press 1949) * Coutanceau, Michel Henri Marie La Campagne de 1794 a l'Arm√©e du Nord (1903-08 5 Volumes) (Paris: Chapelot) * Brown, Robert An impartial Journal of a Detachment from the Brigade of Foot Guards, commencing 25th February, 1793, and ending 9th May, 1795 (London 1795) * Anon.

After the war, he published several books including The Saga of a Sig. In 2007, when Clift was 91, the Defence Force School of Signals (DFSS) Holding Troop was renamed the \\"Ken Clift Troop\\" in his honour. War service The day after war was declared, Clift enlisted with the Second AIF and sailed in the first convoy to Palestine. He saw service in Libya, Egypt, Bardia, Tobruk, Greece and Crete then, while returning to Australia, stopped in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where he completed a commando selection course. He later fought in the Kokoda Track campaign. He entered the war as a signaller in the 2/1st Battalion (part of the 16th Brigade, 6th Division) and was discharged as a lieutenant in the 1st Australian Parachute Battalion in October 1945. He was in hospital when the war ended, after fracturing his back in a parachute jump. He always said that being a corporal was the easiest rank to get, noting that he was promoted to it four times in one year ‚Äì and was busted back down again the same number of times. Clift was regarded as a near miss for the Victoria Cross for his actions around Tobruk in 1941. He and two other linesmen, working ahead of the advancing troops, took on a battery of Italian field guns protected by machine-guns.

Cored drilling investigations on the two possible alignments were completed in the 1960s. After the completion of Mazvikadei dam [1985‚Äì'88] under Italian aid finance, further funding became available for the project and when the 10 000 hectares of potential irrigable land was identified downstream the project was approved in 1989 by the multi-ministry irrigation committee of the Zimbabwe Government. Technical details Osborne Dam is an earth embankment dam, creating a reservoir with a surface area of 2600 hectares, storing 400,000 megalitres on the Odzi River, a tributary of the Save River, in Zimbabwe The catchment area is 1392 km¬≤ the embankment is 66 metres high, crest length 1007 metres and the volume of earth in the embankment is 5.1 Million cubic metres. The spillway is the \\"drop inlet\\" type with a crest radius of 15.7 metres, a 6-metre diameter shaft and conduit conveys the overflow to the flip bucket. The catchment area of 2 400 square kilometres stretches up to the source of the Odzi river in the high rainfall area just south of Juliasdale.

Gaspard- Th√©odore-Ignace de la Fontaine, leader of the Orangists Orangism was a movement in the 19th century Grand Duchy of Luxembourg favouring the personal union of the Netherlands and Luxembourg under the House of Orange-Nassau. Made up of many notable figures, mainly nobles and Roman Catholic clergy, they were moderate liberals or conservative-liberals and slightly anti-clerical. At first they favoured maintaining the Grand Duchy's autonomous status and, especially during the Belgian Revolution, opposed it being merged into Belgium. In the end the western part of the Grand Duchy (the present province of Luxembourg) passed to Belgium, whilst the eastern part and the Orange grand duchy continued as an independent state. In 1890 the heads of the House of Orange were grand dukes of Luxembourg, but on the death of king and grand duke William III in 1890 he was succeeded by his relation Adolphe as grand duke since Luxembourg's constitution did not allow a woman (Princess Wilhelmina) to hold the throne. The movement's newsletter was the Journal de la Ville et du Pays Luxembourg.

The Closed Beta date was set to be on September 18, 2007.http://12-sky.aeriagames.com/node/56 Twelve Sky then went into Open Beta on October 12, 2007.http://12-sky.aeriagames.com/node/73 AeriaGames announced the closing of the game on April 6 on their forums. The game officially closed on April 30, 2010 with their item mall closing on April 13, 2010. Gameplay=Starting A Character or a Play Session= As with other MMORPGs, players control a character avatar within a game world, exploring the landscape, fighting monsters, completing quests and interacting with NPCs or other players. Twelve Sky does not require the player to pay for a subscription. Each player can have 3 characters on a single account, with multiple accounts possible. To enter the game, the player must select a server. Each server acts as an individual copy of the game world and players can enter them freely with any character. Servers are all Player versus player (PvP) where open combat among players is common while including all aspects of Player versus environment (PvE) where players can defeat monsters and complete quests. On any server a player may create characters belonging to only a single faction; Guanyin,Fujin or Jinong on any single account.http://12-sky.aeriagames.com/guide/factions To create a new character players must choose between the factions of Guanyin,Fujin or Jinong. Characters from the factions can communicate and trade with only players of their faction and form guilds with only their faction. The player selects the new character's faction as Guanyin, Fujin or Jinong. Player can also choose gender and hair style/color and their avatar's name. Each faction has a unique appearance and set of skills available to them and players much choose their play style based on the attributes of the separate factions. =On-Going Gameplay= Once the character has finished the character creation, he is placed into the world of Twelve Sky and can immediately engage in Player versus Environment battles. The player can engage in Player versus Player battles in certain areas. Creatures in the world drop items or money which can be exchanged for goods at stores or at player created markets. As the player gains levels, they receive stat points which may be used to upgrade the four stats: Strength, Dexterity, Vitality and Chi. Characters may also form or join guilds. Characters in the same guild have a private chat channel, a shared guild name, guild storage and possibly battle in duels. Much Twelve Sky play involves questing. These quests, also called tasks or missions, are usually available from non-player characters (NPCs). Quests usually reward the player with experience points or items. It is also through quests that much of the game's story is told. Some quests are linked by a common theme, with the next quest triggered by the completion of the previous, forming a quest chain. Quests commonly involve killing a number of creatures, gathering a certain number of resources, finding a difficult to locate object, speaking to various NPCs, visiting specific locations, interacting with objects in the world, or delivering an item from one place to another. While a character can be played on its own, players can also group up with others in order to tackle more challenging content. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group. When a character dies, it resurrects in the most recent \\"safe\\" location as a re-spawn point. When a character dies to a monster, there is a possibility of dropping items the player has equipped, allowing retrieval of lost equipment. Twelve Sky contains a variety of mechanisms for Player Versus Player (PvP) combat. Each server allows player versus player combat in certain environments. In these environments, players can attack each other at almost any time or location. On all servers there are special areas of the world where free-for-all combat is permitted. Battle arenas, for example, allow all players to engage each other without fear of penalty or loss of rank. = Setting = Twelve Sky is a Massively Multi-Player Online Role Playing Game. It takes place in a 3D-representation of the world of Middle Ages China that players can interact with through their characters. The game features three main homelands, one for each faction. In this game world, players use their characters to explore locations, defeat creatures and complete quests, among other such activities. By doing this, characters gain experience points. After a set amount of experience points have been gained, a character gains a level and new stat points, opening up the option of learning new skills and using new items, exploring new areas and attempting new quests. Although the game world remains reasonably similar from day to day, locations have changeable weather such as dust, snow and storms. A number of facilities are available to characters when in towns and cities. In each major city characters can access a warehouse in order to deposit items, such as treasure or crafted items. Each warehouse is unique to that character, with players able to purchase additional storage space. In the major cities of Twelve Sky, players can expect to see player hosted booths. Some of the harder challenges in Twelve Sky require players to group together to complete them. These usually take place in dungeons and other difficult areas that a group of characters can enter together. This allows players to explore areas and complete quests with other players outside the group. Development Twelve Sky was first released by GigasSoft in Korea, 2004. Since then it has expanded to China and now Japan and North America. The game was designed to be an open environment where players are allowed to do what they please. Quests are optional and were designed to help guide players, allow character development, and to spread characters across different zones to try to avoid what developers call 'player collision'. The game interface allows players to customize appearance and controls and other modifications. =Regional Variations= ALT1 distributes Twelve Sky in the following countries: Korea, China. =Closing of the AeriaGames Version= Aeria Games, the publisher of the English version of Twelve Sky, announced the closing of the game on April 6, 2010 on their forums, and officially closed the game on April 30, with their item mall closing on April 13.

Rosenberg, Qing Ma, William Farrell, Mark Keefe, and Derrick C. Mancini: X-ray welding of metal-matrix composites. Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439 USA. DOI: 10.1063/1.1148159. The phrase \\"X-ray welding\\" also has an older, unrelated usage in quality control. In this context, an X-ray welder is a tradesman who consistently welds at such a high proficiency that he rarely introduces defects into the weld pool, and is able to recognize and correct defects in the weld pool, during the welding process. It is assumed (or trusted) by the Quality Control Department of a fabrication or manufacturing shop that the welding work performed by an X-ray welder would pass an X-ray inspection. For example, defects like porosity, concavities, cracks, cold laps, slag and tungsten inclusions, lack of fusion & penetration, etc., are rarely seen in a radiographic X-ray inspection of a weldment performed by an X-ray welder. NDT Resources - Radiograph Interpretation. With the growing use of synchrotron radiation in the welding process, the older usage of the phrase \\"X-Ray welding\\" might cause confusion; but the two terms are unlikely to be used in the same work environment because synchrotron radiation (X-Ray) welding is a remotely automated and mechanized process.  Introduction  Many advances in welding technology have resulted from the introduction of new sources of the thermal energy required for localized melting. These advances include the introduction of modern techniques such as gas tungsten arc, gas-metal arc, submerged-arc, electron beam, and laser beam welding processes. However, whilst these processes were able to improve stability, reproducibility, and accuracy of welding, they share a common limitation - the energy does not fully penetrate the material to be welded, resulting in the formation of a melt pool on the surface of the material. To achieve welds which penetrate the full depth of the material, it is necessary to either specially design and prepare the geometry of the joint or cause vaporization of the material to such a degree that a \\"keyhole\\" is formed, allowing the heat to penetrate the joint. This is not a significant disadvantage in many types of material, as good joint strengths can be achieved, however for certain material classes such as ceramics or metal ceramic composites, such processing can significantly limit joint strength. They have great potential for use in the aerospace industry, provided a joining process that maintains the strength of the material can be found. Until recently, sources of x-rays of sufficient intensity to cause enough volumetric heating for welding were not available. However, with the advent of third-generation synchrotron radiation sources, it is possible to achieve the power required for localized melting and even vaporization in a number of materials. X-ray beams have been shown to have potential as welding sources for classes of materials which cannot be welded conventionally.

The Portuguese had attempted three times without success to capture the Kingdom of Kandy, in order to bring the entire island under their rule. In 1635, Rajasinghe II became the king of Kandy and started negotiations with the Dutch to obtain their help in driving out the Portuguese. The Portuguese hastened their efforts to take Kandy because of this, and Diogo de Melo de Castro, the Portuguese Captain General, tried to provoke the Sinhalese on several occasions. Melo seized an elephant presented to a merchant by the king, to which the king responded by seizing two of Melo's own horses. Following this incident, Melo assembled his troops and set out for Kandy. The city of Kandy was evacuated by the Sinhalese, and Melo's army found the city empty when they arrived. They sacked and burned the city, and started to return to Colombo. However, their way forward was blocked by the Sinhalese army at Gannoruwa. The Portuguese force was surrounded with all escape routes cut off. On 28 March 1638, the Sinhalese army attacked the Portuguese force, leaving only 33 Portuguese soldiers alive, along with a number of mercenaries. The heads of the killed Portuguese soldiers were piled before the Sinhalese king Rajasingha II . The battle, which ended in victory for the Sinhalese army, was the last battle fought between the Portuguese and the Sinhalese, and was also the final battle fought by the Kingdom of Kandy. The Portuguese were driven out of the country by the Dutch soon afterward. Background King Rajasinghe II, who led the Sinhalese army at the Battle of Gannoruwa. The Portuguese first landed in Sri Lanka in 1505. The aim of the Portuguese was to capture the entire island. which was split into several kingdoms. By 1619, they were in control of the kingdoms of Kotte, Sitawaka and Jaffna. Kandy was the only remaining kingdom under the native king's rule. The Portuguese attempted to capture Kandy in 1594, 1603 and 1630, but were defeated on all three occasions. In 1635, with the death of King Senarath, the kingdom was split into three parts. His son became the king of Kandy as Rajasinghe II, and Rajasinghe's cousins, Wijayapala and Kumarasinghe, were given control of the Matale and Uva areas. Rajasinghe, earlier known as Maha Asthana, had fought against the Portuguese at the Battle of Randeniwela along with his father and cousins in 1630. Rajasinghe II began negotiations with the Dutch to get their help in defeating the Portuguese. As a result of this, the Portuguese hastened their attempts to capture Kandy. Diogo de Melo de Castro was the Portuguese Captain General in Colombo, having been appointed to that position in 1633. =Provocations= Melo followed an aggressive approach towards Kandy from the beginning. A caravan of 600 men and bulls was taken into custody and later released. He also raised issues with the peace accord that had been signed earlier between the Portuguese and King Senarath. In the meantime, he assembled his troops in preparation for an attack on Kandy. These troops later encamped in Atapitiya, close to the boundaries of the Kingdom of Kandy as a show of strength. In response to this, the Sinhalese strengthened their defences with troops from Matale and Uva. Rajasinghe had presented an elephant to a Portuguese merchant, Ant√≥nio Machado, who had gained the king's favour. Melo took this elephant into his possession. After hearing about this, Rajasinghe presented another elephant to the merchant. He then seized two horses that were sent to Kandy by Melo for sale, and informed Melo that the horses would be released upon the return of the elephant. The Portuguese also killed Rajasinghe's Disawe, a regional officer, of Batticaloa, much to the king's anger. Preparations Melo began preparing his troops to attack Kandy after the seizure of his horses by the Sinhalese king. He ordered his Disawes to summon the army to a village named Menikkadawara. On 19 March 1638, Melo departed from Colombo and arrived at Menikkadawara with an army of 900 Portuguese soldiers and 5000 mercenaries including Lascarins, Kaffirs, Malays, Canarese and some Sinhalese. Troops were also brought from Malacca for the battle. Rajasinghe sent a letter to Melo through a Portuguese friar seeking negotiations, but this call was rejected by Melo, who replied, saying \\"The little black is frightened. We shall drag him by the ears\\". The king, angered by this remark, summoned his troops and prepared for the battle. The Portuguese army was put under the command of Fern√£o de Mendon√ßa Furtado, the nephew and son in law of Melo. The city was evacuated, since the Sinhalese army was not capable of facing the Portuguese army head on. Everything of value in the city was taken away. Instead of facing the Portuguese directly, Rajasinghe and his generals planned a trap. The Sinhalese army encamped on Gannoruwa hill, preparing to attack the Portuguese force upon their return from Kandy. =The king's vow= While reconnoitering with his generals in the area around a shrine called Nahimige Kovila, the king's crown fell from his head. He was informed by his men that he was near the shrine and that the deity presiding in the shrine was powerful. Rajasinghe vowed at the shrine that if he succeeded in defeating the Portuguese, he would present his crown and sword to the shrine. Battle The Portuguese force advanced through Atapitiya to Balana, a fort and observation post of the king's army. They proceeded to Kandy, and found the city deserted. They sacked and burned the city, including the royal palace and temples, and then withdrew, intending to return to Colombo. They retreated towards Balana with the objective of entrenching themselves on the slopes of Kiriwat Talawa, but had only reached Gannoruwa by nightfall. The king's army was strengthened by Wijayapala's troops from Matale, and the combined Sinhalese army was also assisted by Indian soldiers and Moors. At Gannoruwa, Sinhalese woodmen cut down forest trees and obstructed the Portuguese path, preventing them from crossing the nearby Mahaweli river. The road back to Kandy was blocked by troops from Matale, and all escape routes were effectively cut off. The stragglers around the main force were killed by sharpshooters hidden in the surrounding forests. On the following day, 28 March 1638, the Portuguese force tried to resume their retreat. Sinhalese army at once attacked the Lascarins carrying provisions and separated them from the main force. The Lascarins abandoned the provisions in order to retreat and rejoin the main force. Before the Portuguese troops could reach the high ground at Kiriwat Talawa, the Sinhalese army surrounded them and opened fire with their heavy guns, including jingals. Whilst, several factors had made the Portuguese fire power and heavy cannons useless. With the Portuguese force suffering heavy casualties, Melo requested an armistice. Rajasinghe did not reply to this, but ordered his drummers to proclaim that all Sinhalese that were with the Portuguese force were to leave them. They were told that those who remained would be put to the sword the next day. Numbers of the Portuguese force were rapidly reduced before the Sinhalese army charged up the hill and attacked them. Rajasinghe conducted his troops during the battle from under the shade of a tree. The Portuguese force was almost completely destroyed in the fight that ensued. Approximately 4,000 soldiers of the Portuguese force were killed. Only 33 Portuguese soldiers were left alive, along with a number of mercenaries. Rajasinghe and Wijayapala ordered their men not to kill the survivors after the battle was won. Heads of the killed soldiers were piled before the Sinhalese king. A search was made for Melo's body, but it was not found. However, some Sinhalese soldiers found Melo's sword, and presented it to Rajasinghe. Aftermath After the victory, Rajasinghe presented his sword and crown to the Dodanwala Devala as he had vowed. Men who had taken part in the battle received positions and lands as rewards. The commanders who led the Sinhalese army in the battle were promoted to higher ranks. The Portuguese did not make any other attempts to take Kandy after this. The Battle of Gannoruwa was the last battle fought by the Kingdom of Kandy. It was also the last battle fought between the Portuguese and the Sri Lankans. Rajasinghe eventually made an agreement with the Dutch to drive the Portuguese from the country. As a result, the Portuguese were driven out by the Dutch in 1658. King Rajasinghe II later presented Melo's sword to a Dutch Admiral, Adam Westerwolt. The success of the Sinhalese army at the battle was later glorified in the poems Konstantinuhatane and Mahahatane.

Lewis was responsible for designing and overseeing many government buildings in Sydney and rural New South Wales, many of which are heritage listed. Early life Lewis was born in Middlesex, England, in 1796, to Thomas Arundel Lewis and Caroline Lewis (n√©e Derby) At the age of nineteen, he started work as a surveyor and draughtsman in the London office of the Inspector General of Fortifications. In 1819, he married Elizabeth Clements, who bore him three sons and a daughter. Another son was to be born later in Sydney, New South Wales. Lewis lived in the Eyre Estate at 11 South Bank, near St Johns Wood. After eight years in private practice, Lewis received an appointment as assistant surveyor in the office of surveyor-general of New South Wales. He set sail with his family in 1829 and arrived in Sydney in March, 1830. Career in Australia Lewis arrived in Sydney via Hobart on 1 April 1830 as a free settler aboard the convict ship the Dunvegan Castle, which left Britain on 28 September 1829., additional text. From 1830 Lewis worked in the office of surveyor- general of New South Wales under Sir Thomas Mitchell, and during this time mapped the Great Dividing Range, 130 kilometres west of Sydney. Lewis was appointed to be the Town Surveyor; in 1835 he was further promoted to the position of Colonial Architect which he held for 14 years during a period of great expansion. A long series of public works throughout New South Wales followed, including court houses, police stations and government buildings. Lewis also supervised the construction of buildings designed by other architects, a notable example being Government House designed in England by Edward Blore. Lewis became the leading proponent in Australia of the Classical Revival style,The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.70 in particular the Doric variation, although he did not exclusively design in this style. Lewis's post as Colonial Architect ended sourly after a public controversy concerning the construction of Sydney‚Äôs first museum. In the late 1840s he began designing Sydney's first museum, which would later be absorbed into the present Australian Museum. The project experienced substantial cost overruns during construction and Lewis was heavily criticised by both the press and politicians. The museum was completed, but an official inquiry blamed Lewis and he was forced to resign as Colonial Architect in 1849, after twenty nine years in retirement, Lewis died of a kidney ailment in 1879. Notable works=Gladesville Mental Hospital= In 1835 Governor Bourke made suggestions within reports of that he had finally discovered an architect competent enough to satisfy his needs within the public works sector. Lewis' discovery to Bourke came at a time when there was desperate need of a Lunatic Asylum which was adequate to deal with problem people within the colony. Lewis began work in 1836 and the Gladesville Asylum opened in 1838. His design had a simple traditional facade, symmetrical in plan and elevation. The Ionic columns of the portico would have been one of the first examples of such ornate craftsmanship within Australia at this time. Previously it was more common to see Doric columns with circular detailing at the capitals, requiring far less detail and craftsmanship than the ornate Ionic columns designed by Lewis. =St John's Anglican Church, Camden= St John's Anglican Church of , completed in 1849, is regarded as one of the finest examples of Gothic Revival architecture in Australia. The church was constructed from local materials such as stone and clay. The clay is known to produce bricks with a great variation in colour and the St. Johns church is no exception producing pink, russet, red and orange bricks. Lewis had an affinity with stucco at the time of construction and the bricks of the church were laid with the anticipation of a secondary finish which never occurred for unknown reasons. Ironically the roughly laid bricks resulted in a richness in the facade, adding character and depth. =Darlinghurst Courthouse= Said to be one of Lewis‚Äô most important works, the \\"erudite Greek Classic \\"Darlinghurst Courthouse was commenced in 1835 and completed in 1844. Lewis‚Äô plan placed the court room in the centre, with a symmetrical arrangement of rooms for magistrates and court officials either side. The entry was through a pedimented porch framed with Doric columns, a direct imitation of an ancient Greek temple, except in this instance the Doric columns do not extend to the ground. It is said that the pattern in the sandstone columns was stopped at a height to avoid damage from passing traffic. Darlinghurst Court was the first purposely designed courthouse to be built in NSW, with the general layout and form referenced for buildings of law in Australia for the next 60 years. These included Lewis‚Äôs (c. 1837; destr.) Parramatta Courthouse, New South Wales, and the Supreme Court (1847‚Äì51; now Magistrates‚Äô Court House), Adelaide, South Australia, by Richard Lambeth. The building was altered in 1886 by James Barnet to include major flanking court room additions. The extension facing Victoria Street, completed in 1963, was designed by the Government Architect's Office. =Bronte House= Lewis acquired land in what was to become the beachside suburb of , and started work on the sandstone bungalow which became Bronte House. The house was originally built with the intention of housing his family but Lewis was forced to sell mid-construction during the 1840s recession. The partially built property was purchased by Robert Lowe. The four square asymmetrical plan, including a bay and bow window, was typical of Lewis, except the external detailing, such as the romantic circular and hexagonal corner turrets, were assumed to have been altered to suit the new owners‚Äô needs. The building was sited in the substantial gardens of the naturally irregular site. This picturesque style was not commonly found in Australian Colonial architecture and was thought to be a transition, from the simplicity and symmetry of earlier Georgian building types, to a revivalism of the Victorian era. The house, with garden, remains substantially intact and is owned by Waverley Council, which leases it to private tenants. It is open to the public a few times a year. =Richmond Villa, Millers Point= In 1849, Lewis bought three plots of land behind Macquarie Street, Sydney, facing The Domain. On this plot of land he built his own home, which he called Richmond Villa. It is one of the few examples of Lewis's residential work, since his buildings were generally non-residential. He designed Richmond Villa in a Gothic Revival style, as he had done with Bronte House. The ground floor contained a high verandah with zig-zag lattice-like detailing which contrasted with the building's asymmetrical plan and fenestration. In 1978, the house was dismantled to make way for extensions to Parliament House and was later re- erected in Kent Street, Millers Point.

Hayes Hayes Gymnasium, completed in 1910, is the oldest section of the current Arvin Cadet Physical Development Center at the United States Military Academy. Originally built as an independent structure to replace the Academy's previous Richard Morris Hunt-built gymnasium which had served between 1891 and 1910, it was part of a large contract bid awarded to the Boston architectural firm of Cram, Goodhue, & Ferguson in 1903.Miller (2002), pp. 73‚Äì75. Formerly the East Gym, it was renamed in 1989 for 1st Lt. (posthumously promoted Captain) Thomas Jay Hayes IV, Class of 1966, killed in action in Vietnam on April 17, 1968. Description Hayes gym as viewed from Scott barracks, Dec 2008 Hayes gym is a two-level gymnasium first built in 1910. It is now incorporated into the larger Arvin Cadet Physical Development Center. The gym's first floor underwent extensive renovation during recent rebuild of the overall Arvin gym complex, while the \\"main room\\" of the gym received new ventilation and roofing. The first floor the houses two large rooms that are currently utilized as the \\"Class of 1962 Fitness Center\\", which is bisected by the \\"Class of 1957 Hallway\\". The west wall of Hayes gym was torn down and reconstructed to mesh with the new Arvin gym renovation, which opened in August 2004. '62 Fitness Room The Class of 1962 donated an endowment which furnishes and maintains a large fitness center in the first floor of the gym. When originally dedicated, the \\"'62 Room\\" comprised the south half of the first floor of Hayes. Originally the room was furnished with weight machines and cardio equipment. It is utilized as an expanded \\"cardio\\" room, with treadmills, stationary bicycles, stair climbers, and other cardio equipment. The north half of Hayes gym was formerly the boxing instruction room(s), but they have now been combined to form one large room that houses weight machines, exercise mats, and balance and stretching equipment. '57 Hallway Class of '57 hallway A wide hallway bisects the two main rooms on the first floor, running east‚Äìwest. The academy has maintained the gothic interior architecture of this hallway during the many different renovations of Hayes. Maintained by a gift from the class of 1957, this un-renovated section of the building is a link to the gym's past when it was not only a place of exercise, but also housed the cadet restaurant and was a place for social gatherings. Formal ceremonies are occasionally held in this large hallway because of its \\"old-fashioned\\" look. Hayes military movement laboratory The second level of Hayes is what most cadets and USMA graduates think of as \\"Hayes Gym\\". It is a large open gym with a vaulted ceiling, hardwood floor, and elevated track (11.7 laps to a mile) that rings the room. The Department of Physical Education (DPE), USMA, teaches applied gymnastics (called \\"Military Movement\\") in Hayes, taking advantage of its historical and unusual support structures. The gym has eighteen 21' vertical ropes and two 60' horizontal ropes (suspended 12' from the floor). There are also 10 pull-up bars that are re 5' wide each and are suspended from the ceiling from vertical supports in such a manner that they can be \\"run across\\" (with proper technique), as is done during the IOCT. The gym's floor space is filled with gymnastic's apparatus and pads, such as vaults, bars, and rings as well as 1\\" and 4\\" tumbling mats. Prior to the reconstruction of the new Arvin CPDC, Hayes was also used for its basketball court, as three undersized courts fit side-by-side with the backboards suspended from the track structure. With the completion of the new gym and the six dedicated basketball courts in other parts of Arvin, DPE has removed the rims from the Hayes backboards and no longer uses it as a basketball or team handball facility, allowing the military movement equipment to remain in place year-round.

History The species was first described by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1832. It is found in Australia, including Tasmania. Appearance The adult moth's wingspan is about 70 mm for males and 100 mm for females. The large brown caterpillar has a puffy brown segmented body with urticating hairs on each rise with none between. These hairs are both long and short, with the longer ones being white and the shorter ones being brown giving the caterpillar a tufted look, especially visible when curled in the defense posture of a spiral. article The hairs are very fine and brittle, easily penetrating the skin and breaking off. Female caterpillars grow to about 8 cms long, but the male's length is only about 5 cms. The caterpillar pupates in a brown cocoon, first having poked its hairs through the cocoon wall before pupating inside, giving the cocoon a furry appearance. These hairs are just as thin and brittle as when they were on the caterpillar. Lifecycle The larvae feed on various Acacia species, especially Acacia baileyana and Acacia dealbata. (Personal observation of this taxon, in all life stages, suggested that-in central coastal parts of South Australia, where it's larvae and cocoons were observed only on and in large sprawling shrubs of Acacia longifolia subspecies sophorae, growing naturally in stable depressions and more densely vegetated swales in silica sand dunes ).

Located seven miles south-west of Bury St Edmunds, in 2011 its population was 221. The village has an Anglican church dedicated to All Saints. In 1870, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Stansfield as : \\"A parish, with S. village and Assington-Green hamlet, in Risbridge district, Suffolk; 5 miles N by E of Clare r. station. It has a post-office under Sudbury. Acres, 1,989. Real property, ¬£2,998. Pop., 549. Houses, 109. The property is divided among a few. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Ely. Value, ¬£500.* Patron, the Lord Chancellor. There are an Independent chapel, and charities ¬£11\\". History In Old English, Stansfield would have been interpreted as ‚ÄòStan‚Äôs open land‚Äô, referring to someone's unencumbered and arable land in which they owned at the time. Earliest History of Stansfield dates back to 1066 in the Domesday Book, where the value to the Lord was ¬£3.50. The Lords of Stansfield in 1066 were Crawa, Edric Spud and Wulffled. Occupational data of males of Stansfield, as reported by the census of 1831 In 1831, the main source of industry in Stansfield was Agricultural labourers, followed by Retail & Handicrafts. The least common trade was Capitalists & Professionals. Labourers and servants occupied 81 jobs in 1831, 21 as middling sorts and 10 as employers and professionals. In 1881, the introduction of women's occupations on the census was initiated. While 87 males remained working in the agricultural sector, 15 females were engaged in domestic offices and services, 12 of which were domestic indoor servants. 72 females were classified as ‚Äòunknown occupation‚Äô, compared to just one male. Between 1837 and 1889 Stansfield was part of the Risbridge Registration District and the Suffolk County. On 1 April 1889 however, Stansfield became part of the West Suffolk County, where it remained so until 1938. In 1938 Risbridge Registration District lost several parishes, of which Stansfield was one. On 1 July 1938 Stansfield became part of the Newmarket Registration District. Demographics Stansfield population was 221 in 2011, of which 117 were economically active and 57 economically inactive. Of the inactive population 27 were retired. The population of Stansfield has been declining since the 1850s. In 1841 the population peaked at 510 but, by 1961 it had declined to 186, as seen in the 'Current Total Population graph'. This suggests that between 1841 and 1961 people began to move from rural communities and parishes to bigger cities such as London where there was work emerging in the factories and the industrial sector. This follows the average trend of the country for that period. Total population of Stansfield as reported by the Census of Population from 1801 to 2011. In 2011, the industry employing the most people in Stansfield was construction with 13 people. Additionally the second most popular was professional, scientific and technical activities with 12 people. The least common industry in the parish was Public Administration and Defence with 3 people, showing a clear shift in industry since the 19th century. According to the 2011 census, 56% of the people living in Stansfield were Christian, slightly below the national average which was 59.4%, as well as the 2001 percentage of Christians in Stansfield which was 69%. 32% stated no religion in the 2011 census. In terms of housing, there was a peak of houses in 1851 when there was 116. From the first census data in 1831, it is clear that there was a rapid increase in housing between 1831 and 1841 where there was an increase from 62 houses to 105. This continued to increase until 1851. Over the next 30 years houses began to decrease as people would have moved to cities such as London in search of factory work. Between 1901 and 1961 houses remained in the numbers of 70-80. By 2011 the number of houses in the parish had increased to 92, an increase of nine from the 2001 census. Church With 56% of the local population classified as Christian, the local church; All Saints Church has always played a pivotal role within the community. The church itself is flint- fronted and is situated at the north end of the village on Plough Hill. History of the church dates back to the time of the Norman conquest. Very little of the original church still exists, In 1896 the 70 foot, fourteenth century, Norman erected foot tower was restored and new tower bells were introduced. In regards to the size of the church, it can be considered large in comparison to the size of the parish and local population. It was restored again recently, through efforts of the Stansfield Church Restoration Committee and the whole village. Within the church a war memorial can be found to commemorate the Stansfield men that lost their lives in the First and Second World Wars. On the memorial it states; :\\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends\\" St John In total, ten men lost their lives, eight in the First World War and two in the Second World War. Between the years of 1642 and 1661 no marriages were registered in Stansfield. It appears that under the act of 1653, marriage became a civil ceremony, thus the functions of the Clergy were transferred to the Justices of Peace; and the registers of such marriages may have been kept elsewhere. From 1653 to 1660, it is noticeable that the entries of births, baptisms and burials are well kept and written in English. The last entry under the commonwealth in English was on 3 May 1960. The next being on 14 August of the same year but in Latin. Latin was in continued use until 1732. Community Stansfield parish features a book club, village fete, bridge club, cricket club and a monthly newsletter. With a low population, each activity allows the community spirit to remain high. The Parish features its own council, which discusses community concerns and events taking place. Typically made up of six residents of the community. In terms of schools in the local area, the closest primary school is 2.9 miles away from Stansfield and is Wickhambrook Community Primary School, while the closest secondary school is 4.3 miles away and is Stour Valley Community School. Present Day The Parish of Stansfield is still rather inaccessible via public transport. The closest railway station is 12.1 miles away and is in Sudbury. There is one bus which runs through Stansfield. It is the 343 bus run by Stephensons Coaches between Poslingford and Haverhill. Stansfield is part of Suffolk ACRE's Community Buying Enterprise which helps residents to save money on heating oil within households.

The most common reason for transforming source code is to create an executable program. Any program written in a high-level programming language must be translated to object code before it can be executed, so all programmers using such a language use a compiler or an interpreter. Thus, compilers are very important to programmers. Improvements to a compiler may lead to a large number of improved features in executable programs. The Production Quality Compiler-Compiler, in the late 1970s, introduced the principles of compiler organization that are still widely used today (e.g., a front-end handling syntax and semantics and a back- end generating machine code).  First compilers  Software for early computers was primarily written in assembly language. It is usually more productive for a programmer to use a high-level language, and programs written in a high-level language can be reused on different kinds of computers. Even so, it took a while for compilers to become established, because they generated code that did not perform as well as hand-written assembler, they were daunting development projects in their own right, and the very limited memory capacity of early computers created many technical problems for practical compiler implementations. The first practical compiler was written by Corrado B√∂hm, in 1951, for his PhD thesis. The first implemented compiler was written by Grace Hopper, who also coined the term \\"compiler\\",Maurice V. Wilkes. 1968. Computers Then and Now. Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, 15(1):1‚Äì7, January. p. 3 (a comment in brackets added by editor), \\"(I do not think that the term compiler was then [1953] in general use, although it had in fact been introduced by Grace Hopper.)\\" The World's First COBOL Compilers referring to her A-0 system which functioned as a loader or linker, not the modern notion of a compiler. The first Autocode and compiler in the modern sense were developed by Alick Glennie in 1952 at the University of Manchester for the Mark 1 computer. The FORTRAN team led by John W. Backus at IBM introduced the first commercially available compiler, in 1957, which took 18 person-years to create.Backus et al. \\"The FORTRAN automatic coding system\\", Proc. AFIPS 1957 Western Joint Computer Conf., Spartan Books, Baltimore 188‚Äì198 The first ALGOL 58 compiler was completed by the end of 1958 by Friedrich L. Bauer, Hermann Bottenbruch, Heinz Rutishauser, and Klaus Samelson for the Z22 computer. Bauer et al. had been working on compiler technology for the Sequentielle Formel√ºbersetzung (i.e. sequential formula translation) in the previous years. By 1960, an extended Fortran compiler, ALTAC, was available on the Philco 2000, so it is probable that a Fortran program was compiled for both IBM and Philco computer architectures in mid-1960. Rosen, Saul. ALTAC, FORTRAN, and compatibility. Proceedings of the 1961 16th ACM national meeting The first known demonstrated cross-platform high-level language was COBOL. In a demonstration in December 1960, a COBOL program was compiled and executed on both the UNIVAC II and the RCA 501.  Self-hosting compilers  Like any other software, there are benefits from implementing a compiler in a high-level language. In particular, a compiler can be self-hosted ‚Äì that is, written in the programming language it compiles. Building a self-hosting compiler is a bootstrapping problem, i.e. the first such compiler for a language must be either hand written machine code or compiled by a compiler written in another language, or compiled by running the compiler in an interpreter. = Corrado B√∂hm PhD dissertation = Corrado B√∂hm developed a language, a machine, and a translation method for compiling that language on the machine in his PhD dissertation dated 1951. He not only described a complete compiler, but also defined for the first time that compiler in its own language. The language was interesting in itself, because every statement (including input statements, output statements and control statements) was a special case of an assignment statement. = NELIAC = The Navy Electronics Laboratory International ALGOL Compiler or NELIAC was a dialect and compiler implementation of the ALGOL 58 programming language developed by the Naval Electronics Laboratory in 1958. NELIAC was the brainchild of Harry Huskey ‚Äî then Chairman of the ACM and a well known computer scientist (and later academic supervisor of Niklaus Wirth), and supported by Maury Halstead, the head of the computational center at NEL. The earliest version was implemented on the prototype USQ-17 computer (called the Countess) at the laboratory. It was the world's first self-compiling compiler - the compiler was first coded in simplified form in assembly language (the bootstrap), then re-written in its own language and compiled by the bootstrap, and finally re-compiled by itself, making the bootstrap obsolete. = Lisp = Another early self-hosting compiler was written for Lisp by Tim Hart and Mike Levin at MIT in 1962.T. Hart and M. Levin \\"The New Compiler\\", AIM-39 CSAIL Digital Archive ‚Äì Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Series They wrote a Lisp compiler in Lisp, testing it inside an existing Lisp interpreter. Once they had improved the compiler to the point where it could compile its own source code, it was self-hosting. :The compiler as it exists on the standard compiler tape is a machine language program that was obtained by having the S-expression definition of the compiler work on itself through the interpreter. (AI Memo 39) This technique is only possible when an interpreter already exists for the very same language that is to be compiled. It borrows directly from the notion of running a program on itself as input, which is also used in various proofs in theoretical computer science, such as the proof that the halting problem is undecidable. = Forth = Forth is an example of a self-hosting compiler. The self compilation and cross compilation features of Forth are commonly confused with metacompilation and metacompilers. Like Lisp, Forth is an extensible programming language. It is the extensible programming language features of Forth and Lisp that enable them to generate new versions of themselves or port themselves to new environments.  Context- free grammars and parsers  A parser is an important component of a compiler. It parses the source code of a computer programming language to create some form of internal representation. Programming languages tend to be specified in terms of a context-free grammar because fast and efficient parsers can be written for them. Parsers can be written by hand or generated by a parser generator. A context-free grammar provides a simple and precise mechanism for describing how programming language constructs are built from smaller blocks. The formalism of context-free grammars was developed in the mid-1950s by Noam Chomsky. Block structure was introduced into computer programming languages by the ALGOL project (1957‚Äì1960), which, as a consequence, also featured a context-free grammar to describe the resulting ALGOL syntax. Context-free grammars are simple enough to allow the construction of efficient parsing algorithms which, for a given string, determine whether and how it can be generated from the grammar. If a programming language designer is willing to work within some limited subsets of context-free grammars, more efficient parsers are possible. = LR parsing = The LR parser (left to right) was invented by Donald Knuth in 1965 in a paper, \\"On the Translation of Languages from Left to Right\\". An LR parser is a parser that reads input from Left to right (as it would appear if visually displayed) and produces a Rightmost derivation. The term LR(k) parser is also used, where k refers to the number of unconsumed lookahead input symbols that are used in making parsing decisions. Knuth proved that LR(k) grammars can be parsed with an execution time essentially proportional to the length of the program, and that every LR(k) grammar for k > 1 can be mechanically transformed into an LR(1) grammar for the same language. In other words, it is only necessary to have one symbol lookahead to parse any deterministic context-free grammar (DCFG). Korenjak (1969) was the first to show parsers for programming languages could be produced using these techniques.Korenjak, A. ‚ÄúA Practical Method for Constructing LR(k) Processors,‚Äù Communications of the ACM, Vol. 12, No. 11, 1969 Frank DeRemer devised the more practical Simple LR (SLR) and Look-ahead LR (LALR) techniques, published in his PhD dissertation at MIT in 1969.DeRemer, F. Practical Translators for LR(k) Languages. PhD dissertation, MIT, 1969.DeRemer, F. ‚ÄúSimple LR(k) Grammars,‚Äù Communications of the ACM, Vol. 14, No. 7, 1971. This was an important breakthrough, because LR(k) translators, as defined by Donald Knuth, were much too large for implementation on computer systems in the 1960s and 1970s. In practice, LALR offers a good solution; the added power of LALR(1) parsers over SLR(1) parsers (that is, LALR(1) can parse more complex grammars than SLR(1)) is useful, and, though LALR(1) is not comparable with LL(1)(See below) (LALR(1) cannot parse all LL(1) grammars), most LL(1) grammars encountered in practice can be parsed by LALR(1). LR(1) grammars are more powerful again than LALR(1); however, an LR(1) grammar requires a canonical LR parser which would be extremely large in size and is not considered practical. The syntax of many programming languages are defined by grammars that can be parsed with an LALR(1) parser, and for this reason LALR parsers are often used by compilers to perform syntax analysis of source code. A recursive ascent parser implements an LALR parser using mutually-recursive functions rather than tables. Thus, the parser is directly encoded in the host language similar to recursive descent. Direct encoding usually yields a parser which is faster than its table-driven equivalent for the same reason that compilation is faster than interpretation. It is also (in principle) possible to hand edit a recursive ascent parser, whereas a tabular implementation is nigh unreadable to the average human. Recursive ascent was first described by Thomas Pennello in his article \\"Very fast LR parsing\\" in 1986. The technique was later expounded upon by G.H. Roberts in 1988 as well as in an article by Leermakers, Augusteijn, Kruseman Aretz in 1992 in the journal Theoretical Computer Science. = LL parsing = An LL parser parses the input from Left to right, and constructs a Leftmost derivation of the sentence (hence LL, as opposed to LR). The class of grammars which are parsable in this way is known as the LL grammars. LL grammars are an even more restricted class of context-free grammars than LR grammars. Nevertheless, they are of great interest to compiler writers, because such a parser is simple and efficient to implement. LL(k) grammars can be parsed by a recursive descent parser which is usually coded by hand, although a notation such as META II might alternatively be used. The design of ALGOL sparked investigation of recursive descent, since the ALGOL language itself is recursive. The concept of recursive descent parsing was discussed in the January 1961 issue of CACM in separate papers by A.A. Grau and Edgar T. \\"Ned\\" Irons. A.A. Grau, \\"Recursive processes and ALGOL translation\\", Commun. ACM, 4, No. 1, pp. 10‚Äì15. Jan. 1961 Edgar T. Irons, \\"A syntax-directed compiler for ALGOL 60\\", Commun. ACM, 4, No. 1, Jan. 1961, pp. 51‚Äì55. Richard Waychoff and colleagues also implemented recursive descent in the Burroughs ALGOL compiler in March 1961, the two groups used different approaches but were in at least informal contact. The idea of LL(1) grammars was introduced by Lewis and Stearns (1968).P. M. Lewis, R. E. Stearns, \\"Syntax directed transduction,\\" focs, pp.21‚Äì35, 7th Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory (SWAT 1966), 1966Lewis, P. and Stearns, R. ‚ÄúSyntax-Directed Transduction,‚Äù Journal of the ACM, Vol. 15, No. 3, 1968. Recursive descent was popularised by Niklaus Wirth with PL/0, an educational programming language used to teach compiler construction in the 1970s. LR parsing can handle a larger range of languages than LL parsing, and is also better at error reporting (This is disputable, REFERENCE is required), i.e. it detects syntactic errors when the input does not conform to the grammar as soon as possible. = Earley parser = In 1970, Jay Earley invented what came to be known as the Earley parser. Earley parsers are appealing because they can parse all context-free languages reasonably efficiently.J. Earley, \\"An efficient context-free parsing algorithm\\", Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery, 13:2:94-102, 1970.  Grammar description languages  John Backus proposed \\"metalinguistic formulas\\" to describe the syntax of the new programming language IAL, known today as ALGOL 58 (1959). Backus's work was based on the Post canonical system devised by Emil Post. Further development of ALGOL led to ALGOL 60; in its report (1963), Peter Naur named Backus's notation Backus normal form (BNF), and simplified it to minimize the character set used. However, Donald Knuth argued that BNF should rather be read as Backus‚ÄìNaur form,Donald E. Knuth, \\"Backus Normal Form vs. Backus Naur Form\\", Commun. ACM, 7(12):735‚Äì736, 1964. and that has become the commonly accepted usage. Niklaus Wirth defined extended Backus‚ÄìNaur form (EBNF), a refined version of BNF, in the early 1970s for PL/0. Augmented Backus‚ÄìNaur form (ABNF) is another variant. Both EBNF and ABNF are widely used to specify the grammar of programming languages, as the inputs to parser generators, and in other fields such as defining communication protocols.  Parser generators  A parser generator generates the lexical-analyser portion of a compiler. It is a program that takes a description of a formal grammar of a specific programming language and produces a parser for that language. That parser can be used in a compiler for that specific language. The parser detects and identifies the reserved words and symbols of the specific language from a stream of text and returns these as tokens to the code which implements the syntactic validation and translation into object code. This second part of the compiler can also be created by a compiler-compiler using a formal rules-of-precedence syntax- description as input. The first compiler-compiler to use that name was written by Tony Brooker in 1960 and was used to create compilers for the Atlas computer at the University of Manchester, including the Atlas Autocode compiler. However it was rather different from modern compiler-compilers, and today would probably be described as being somewhere between a highly customisable generic compiler and an extensible-syntax language. The name 'compiler-compiler' was far more appropriate for Brooker's system than it is for most modern compiler-compilers, which are more accurately described as parser generators. It is almost certain that the \\"Compiler Compiler\\" name has entered common use due to Yacc rather than Brooker's work being remembered. In the early 1960s, Robert McClure at Texas Instruments invented a compiler- compiler called TMG, the name taken from \\"transmogrification\\".R. M. McClure, TMG‚ÄîA Syntax Directed Compiler Proc. 20th ACM National Conf. (1965), pp. 262‚Äì274. In the following years TMG was ported to several UNIVAC and IBM mainframe computers. The Multics project, a joint venture between MIT and Bell Labs, was one of the first to develop an operating system in a high level language. PL/I was chosen as the language, but an external supplier could not supply a working compiler. The Multics team developed their own subset dialect of PL/I known as Early PL/I (EPL) as their implementation language in 1964. TMG was ported to GE-600 series and used to develop EPL by Douglas McIlroy, Robert Morris, and others. Not long after Ken Thompson wrote the first version of Unix for the PDP-7 in 1969, Doug McIlroy created the new system's first higher-level language: an implementation of McClure's TMG. Dennis M. Ritchie. The Development of the C Language TMG was also the compiler definition tool used by Ken Thompson to write the compiler for the B language on his PDP-7 in 1970. B was the immediate ancestor of C. An early LALR parser generator was called \\"TWS\\", created by Frank DeRemer and Tom Pennello. = XPL = XPL is a dialect of the PL/I programming language, used for the development of compilers for computer languages. It was designed and implemented in 1967 by a team with William M. McKeeman, James J. Horning, and David B. Wortman at Stanford University and the University of California, Santa Cruz. It was first announced at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco.McKeeman, William Marshall; Horning, James J.; and Wortman, David B., A Compiler Generator (1971), .Computer Science Department, University of Toronto, \\"The XPL Programming Language\\" XPL featured a relatively simple translator writing system dubbed ANALYZER, based upon a bottom-up compiler precedence parsing technique called MSP (mixed strategy precedence). XPL was bootstrapped through Burroughs Algol onto the IBM System/360 computer. (Some subsequent versions of XPL used on University of Toronto internal projects utilized an SLR(1) parser, but those implementations have never been distributed). = Yacc = Yacc is a parser generator (loosely, compiler- compiler), not to be confused with lex, which is a lexical analyzer frequently used as a first stage by Yacc. Yacc was developed by Stephen C. Johnson at AT&T; for the Unix operating system.Johnson, S.C., ‚ÄúYacc ‚Äì Yet Another Compiler Compiler‚Äù, Computing Science Technical Report 32, AT&T; Bell Labs, 1975 The name is an acronym for \\"Yet Another Compiler Compiler.\\" It generates an LALR(1) compiler based on a grammar written in a notation similar to Backus‚ÄìNaur form. Johnson worked on Yacc in the early 1970s at Bell Labs. He was familiar with TMG and its influence can be seen in Yacc and the design of the C programming language. Because Yacc was the default compiler generator on most Unix systems, it was widely distributed and used. Derivatives such as GNU Bison are still in use. The compiler generated by Yacc requires a lexical analyzer. Lexical analyzer generators, such as lex or flex are widely available. The IEEE POSIX P1003.2 standard defines the functionality and requirements for both Lex and Yacc. = Coco/R = Coco/R is a parser generator that generates LL(1) parsers in Modula-2 (with plug-ins for other languages) from input grammars written in a variant of EBNF. It was developed by Hanspeter M√∂ssenb√∂ck at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ) in 1985. = ANTLR = ANTLR is a parser generator that generates LL(*) parsers in Java from input grammars written in a variant of EBNF. It was developed by Terence Parr at the University of San Francisco in the early 1990s as a successor of an earlier generator called PCCTS.  Metacompilers  Metacompilers differ from parser generators, taking as input a program written in a metalanguage. Their input consists grammar analyzing formula and transform operations that produce abstract syntax trees, or simply output reformated text strings that may be stack machine code. Many can be programmed in their own metalanguage enabling them to compile themselves, making them self-hosting extensible language compilers. Many metacompilers build on the work of Dewey Val Schorre. His META II compiler, first released in 1964, was the first documented metacompiler. Able to define its own language and others, META II accepted syntax formula having imbedded output (code production)s. It also translated to one of the earliest instances of a virtual machine. Lexical analysis was performed by built token recognizing functions: .ID, .STRING, and .NUMBER. Quoted strings in syntax formula recognize lexemes that are not kept. TREE-META, a second generation Schorre metacompiler, appeared around 1968. It extended the capabilities of META II, adding unparse rules separating code production from the grammar analysis. Tree transform operations in the syntax formula produce abstract syntax trees that the unparse rules operate on. The unparse tree pattern matching provided peephole optimization ability. CWIC, described in a 1970 ACM publication is a third generation Schorre metacompiler that added lexing rules and backtracking operators to the grammar analysis. LISP 2 was married with the unparse rules of TREEMETA in the CWIC generator language. With LISP 2 processing, CWIC can generate fully optimized code. CWIC also provided binary code generation into named code sections. Single and multipass compiles could be implemented using CWIC. CWIC compiled to 8 bit byte addressable machine code instructions primarily designed to produce IBM System/360 code. Later generations are not publicly documented. One important feature would be the abstraction of the target processor instruction set, generating to a pseudo machine instruction set, macros, that could be separately defined or mapped to a real machine's instructions. Optimizations applying to sequential instructions could then be applied to the pseudo instruction before their expansion to target machine code.  Cross compilation  A cross compiler runs in one environment but produces object code for another. Cross compilers are used for embedded development, where the target computer has limited capabilities. An early example of cross compilation was AIMICO, where a FLOW-MATIC program on a UNIVAC II was used to generate assembly language for the IBM 705, which was then assembled on the IBM computer. The ALGOL 68C compiler generated ZCODE output, that could then be either compiled into the local machine code by a ZCODE translator or run interpreted. ZCODE is a register-based intermediate language. This ability to interpret or compile ZCODE encouraged the porting of ALGOL 68C to numerous different computer platforms.  Optimizing compilers  Compiler optimization is the process of improving the quality of object code without changing the results it produces. The developers of the first FORTRAN compiler aimed to generate code that was better than the average hand-coded assembler, so that customers would actually use their product. In one of the first real compilers, they often succeeded. Later compilers, like IBM's Fortran IV compiler, placed more priority on good diagnostics and executing more quickly, at the expense of object code optimization. It wasn't until the IBM System/360 series that IBM provided two separate compilers: a fast executing code checker, and a slower optimizing one. Frances E. Allen, working alone and jointly with John Cocke, introduced many of the concepts for optimization. Allen's 1966 paper, Program Optimization,F.E. Allen. Program optimization. In Mark I. Halpern and Christopher J. Shaw, editors, Annual Review in Automatic Programming, volume 5, pages 239‚Äì307.

Allen developed and implemented her methods as part of compilers for the IBM 7030 Stretch-Harvest and the experimental Advanced Computing System. This work established the feasibility and structure of modern machine- and language-independent optimizers. She went on to establish and lead the PTRAN project on the automatic parallel execution of FORTRAN programs.Vivek Sarkar. The PTRAN Parallel Programming System. In Parallel Functional Programming Languages and Compilers, edited by B. Szymanski, ACM Press Frontier Series, pages 309‚Äì391, 1991. Her PTRAN team developed new parallelism detection schemes and created the concept of the program dependence graph, the primary structuring method used by most parallelizing compilers. Programming Languages and their Compilers by John Cocke and Jacob T. Schwartz, published early in 1970, devoted more than 200 pages to optimization algorithms. It included many of the now familiar techniques such as redundant code elimination and strength reduction.John Cocke and Jacob T. Schwartz, Programming Languages and their Compilers. Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, April 1970. = Peephole Optimization = Peephole optimization is a very simple but effective optimization technique. It was invented by William M. McKeeman and published in 1965 in CACM.McKeeman, W.M. Peephole optimization. Commun. ACM 8, 7 (July 1965), 443‚Äì444 It was used in the XPL compiler that McKeeman helped develop. = Capex COBOL Optimizer = Capex Corporation developed the \\"COBOL Optimizer\\" in the mid 1970s for COBOL. This type of optimizer depended, in this case, upon knowledge of 'weaknesses' in the standard IBM COBOL compiler, and actually replaced (or patched) sections of the object code with more efficient code. The replacement code might replace a linear table lookup with a binary search for example or sometimes simply replace a relatively 'slow' instruction with a known faster one that was otherwise functionally equivalent within its context. This technique is now known as \\"Strength reduction\\". For example, on the IBM System/360 hardware the CLI instruction was, depending on the particular model, between twice and 5 times as fast as a CLC instruction for single byte comparisons.http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/A22_6825-1_360instrTiming.pdf Modern compilers typically provide optimization options, so programmers can choose whether or not to execute an optimization pass.  Diagnostics  When a compiler is given a syntactically incorrect program, a good, clear error message is helpful. From the perspective of the compiler writer, it is often difficult to achieve. The WATFIV Fortran compiler was developed at the University of Waterloo, Canada in the late 1960s. It was designed to give better error messages than IBM's Fortran compilers of the time. In addition, WATFIV was far more usable, because it combined compiling, linking and execution into one step, whereas IBM's compilers had three separate components to run. = PL/C = PL/C was a computer programming language developed at Cornell University in the early 1970s. While PL/C was a subset of IBM's PL/I language, it was designed with the specific goal of being used for teaching programming. The two researchers and academic teachers who designed PL/C were Richard W. Conway and Thomas R. Wilcox. They submitted the famous article \\"Design and implementation of a diagnostic compiler for PL/I\\" published in the Communications of ACM in March 1973.CACM March 1973 pp 169‚Äì179. PL/C eliminated some of the more complex features of PL/I, and added extensive debugging and error recovery facilities. The PL/C compiler had the unusual capability of never failing to compile any program, through the use of extensive automatic correction of many syntax errors and by converting any remaining syntax errors to output statements.  Just in Time compilation  Just in time compilation (JIT) is the generation of executable code on-the-fly or as close as possible to its actual execution, to take advantage of run time metrics or other performance enhancing options.  Intermediate representation  Most modern compilers have a lexer and parser that produce an intermediate representation of the program. The intermediate representation is a simple sequence of operations which can be used by an optimizer and a code generator which produces instructions in the machine language of the target processor. Because the code generator uses an intermediate representation, the same code generator can be used for many different high level languages. There are many possibilities for the intermediate representation. Three-address code, also known as a quadruple or quad is a common form, where there is an operator, two operands, and a result. Two-address code or triples have a stack to which results are written, in contrast to the explicit variables of three-address code. Static Single Assignment (SSA) was developed by Ron Cytron, Jeanne Ferrante, Barry K. Rosen, Mark N. Wegman, and F. Kenneth Zadeck, researchers at IBM in the 1980s. In SSA, a variable is given a value only once. A new variable is created rather than modifying an existing one. SSA simplifies optimization and code generation.  Code Generation  A code generator generates machine language instructions for the target processor. = Register Allocation = Sethi‚ÄìUllman algorithm or Sethi-Ullman numbering is a method to minimise the number of registers needed to hold variables.

Gerard Brandt (25 July 1626, Amsterdam - 12 October 1685, Amsterdam) was a Dutch preacher, playwright, poet, church historian, biographer and naval historian. A well-known writer in his own time, his works include a Life of Michiel de Ruyter (1687, Het Leven en bedryf van den Heere Michiel de Ruiter - an important source on the admiral's life) and a Historie der vermaerde zee- en koopstadt Enkhuisen (1666, Geschiedenis van Enkhuizen - still an important source for that city's early history). Life Brandt was the son of the clockmaker Gerard Brandt and his wife Neeltje Jeroens. Aged 17 Gerard junior wrote the play De Veinzende Torquatus, later put on in the Amsterdamse Schouwburg, of which his father was regent. When he later became a well-known preacher and serious scholar, he did not want his youthful works and errors to be remembered. He was best known for his \\"grafrede\\" on Pieter Cornelisz. Hooft in 1647, a translation of Jacques Du Perron's eulogy of Ronsard which he had performed by the actor Van Germez. He also continued his own work, in which he was accused of plagiarism in Aen den onbeschaemden letter-dief, a speech in which he called Hooft \\"the only poet Amstel has produced\\", a clear attack on Vondel. Dutch historian and biographer Under the influence of professor Casparus Barlaeus, and Barlaeus's daughter in particular, Brandt gave up studying watchmaking and in 1652 passed his exam, becoming a Remonstrant preacher in Nieuwkoop. He married Suzanne van Baerle and all three of their sons later became preachers. Brandt worked from 1660 to 1667 in Hoorn, before moving to Amsterdam. In 1676 Michiel de Ruyter had died and in 1681 his son Engel de Ruyter commissioned a biography of him from Brandt for 400 guilder. Brandt received information for it from de Ruyter's widow and children, but it was left incomplete on Brandt's death in 1685 - Brandt's sons Caspar and Johannes completed it, publishing it as a 1,063 page volume in 1687. =Life of Vondel= His exhaustive compilation of the works and biography of the Dutch Poet Joost van den Vondel earned him a place in the list of 1000 key texts of Dutch Literature in the DBNL.See Canon of Dutch Literature under 1682 =Life of Admiral Michiel de Ruyter= In his work on the biographies of artists, Arnold Houbraken quotes Gerard Brand's biography, Willem vanden Velde biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature relating the anecdote where Willem van de Velde the Elder asked Admiral de Ruyter permission to have a galley row him around for a good view of the proceedings on the evening of the sea battle in 1666, an event known as the Four Days Battle. He wasn't the only artist to paint the scenes of this battle: File:De krijgsraad aan boord van de 'De Zeven Provinci√´n', het admiraalschip van Michiel Adriaensz de Ruyter, 10 juni 1666 (Willem van de Velde I, 1693).jpgBattle council on the De Zeven Provinci√´n by Willem van de Velde the Elder, 1666 File:Four days Battle mg 0504.jpgHMS Swiftsure, Seven Oaks and Loyal George captured and flying Dutch colours, by Willem van de Velde the Younger File:Willem van de Velde (II) - De verovering van het Engelse admiraalschip de 'Royal Prince'.jpgWillem van de Velde: The surrender of the Prince Royal'' File:Backhuisen- BattleofFourDays.jpgBattle at Texel, August 1673 by Ludolf Bakhuysen File:Van Soest, Four Days Battle.jpgFour day battle by Pieter Cornelisz van Soest This act later was the reason that van Velde gained his marine commission in London and shows how famous Admiral de Ruyter was in the blind faith that the artists (and the Dutch in general) had in him.

The Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery is located in the Barnsdall Art Park in Los Angeles, California. It focuses on the arts and artists of Southern California. Main building The Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery (LAMAG) is a venue that offers exhibition space for large, thematic group exhibitions that are representative of the current endeavors of area artists, and major retrospective exhibitions of work by individuals who have made an extraordinary contribution and impact on art in Los Angeles. The Junior Arts Center Gallery is a venue that offers a more intimate space for one person exhibitions by mid-career artists who have produced a significant body of high-quality work, as well as smaller thematic group shows. At times the two spaces are linked by a single, large-scale exhibition occupying both galleries. LAMAG is dedicated to the presentation, interpretation, documentation, promotion, and enrichment of the arts and artists of the culturally diverse Southern California. As the city's primary exhibition venue, the gallery is devoted to the exhibiting emerging, mid-career, and senior artists from the area, in group and individual presentation formats. The curatorial focus includes painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, video, installation, design, and related disciplines that reflect the architectural fabric of Los Angeles. The ongoing mission is to provide college level studio arts which are taught by artist/instructors who are professional artists. The Senior Living Arts program provides arts experience for adults with special needs, in retirement center, schools and special facilities. The center has developed a sense of community and has a student body from the ages of 18 well into their 80s. Programming=Exhibitions program= The exhibitions program at Barnsdall Park produces approximately nine exhibitions of contemporary art each year at the Municipal Art Gallery. The mission of the program is to promote, interpret and present to the general public, the contemporary art of artists from culturally diverse Southern California. The curatorial focus includes painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, design, video, electronic, performance and installation works. Exhibits at Barnsdall Park serve over 45,000 visitors annually. Exhibitions at the gallery are developed and produced by the curatorial staff, who often work with guest curators to insure a diversified curatorial perspective. The curators work with advisory input from the gallery's Artist Advisory Committee and the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery Associates Program Committee. These committees each meet six times a year with the curatorial staff to discuss issues, evaluate current exhibitions, and preview the development of future exhibitions. While the Gallery Associates raises funds to support the Exhibition and Education Programs at the gallery, the Associates Program Committee also seeks to develop and produce ancillary programs such as films, lectures and symposia. Gallery hours are Friday through Sunday from 12:00 to 5:00 p.m., and first Fridays from 12 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. A wheelchair for visitor use within the facility is available. Please ask the gallery attendant at the entrance for assistance. Sign Language Interpreters are available with at least two weeks advance notice. =Teacher programs= The Teacher Resource Center is a collection of art education materials available to the public throughout the year. Teachers are welcome to visit the center, conduct research, and borrow from resources that include: a selection of art education and art history books and packets, a slide library containing hundreds of images from historical as well as contemporary art periods, and a collection of mounted small poster prints for use in a range of classroom activities. =Public and family programming= Conversations With The Artists is a way to learn more about the art on exhibition through informal talks with the artists themselves. The Children's Film Series is a film and art workshop offered in the late fall and spring. Self-guided tours for families of art in Barnsdall Park. The Barnsdall Art Park Family Tour is an interactive walking tour that gives family members an opportunity to see the architecture and public works of art in the Park. A specially prepared activity booklet is made available to the public free of charge containing information about the works of art, interesting discussion topics for all ages about each work, and art activities based on the artwork. Slide registry The City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs maintained a Slide Registry which includes slides and artist information of over 1300 artists in California. The Registry was an important resource for curators, art consultants, gallery owners, film studios, developers, and libraries In addition to slide and artist files, information on each artist is also contained in a computer database. There used to be a $20 fee for artists who wish to be registered, but the advent of the digital age and the trend of artists maintaining their own personal websites to display work has led to the decision to shut down the registry in recent years. The education program was designed to help familiarize the public with the rich diversity of contemporary art, particularly the achievements of living Southern California artists that form the core of the Municipal Art Gallery's exhibitions. The Education Department of the Municipal Art Gallery seeks to familiarize the public with the rich diversity of contemporary art, particularly the achievements of living Southern California artists which form the core of the gallery's exhibitions through innovative and participatory programs. The educational programs of Hollyhock House aim to increase public awareness of the history of the house, the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, and the ideas and contributions of Aline Barnsdall; to encourage an understanding of the need to preserve historic sites, and to promote an appreciation of Los Angeles history. Through informal study and discussion, gallery visitors of all ages and backgrounds may better understand and enjoy a challenging range of art in a broad variety of media and styles. With facilitation by the gallery educator, each exhibition becomes an opportunity for the public to explore new perceptions, gather information, and develop fresh insights into the contemporary art world as well as the world around them. Tours The Education division offers tours of LAMAG exhibitions to groups of all ages, from kindergarten to seniors. Tours are led by gallery educators trained in participatory tour techniques that encourage viewers to analyze and refine their appreciation of contemporary art. For student tours, the educators use interactive inquiry methods, role-play, theater techniques and guided art projects to promote enjoyment and understanding. =Outreach programs= The school outreach program introduces aspects of exhibitions to groups before the date of the class visit to the Municipal Art Gallery. Outreach educators travel to classrooms, show slides of selected artworks, and conduct hands-on projects to further prepare students for their gallery visit. Internships In the college and graduate school Internship Program, majors in art, art history or education are trained as gallery educators. They teach in the gallery for a two-hour period on selected mornings, attend weekly training meetings, and keep journals to document their progress. Through direct experience, interns can learn about contemporary art as well as how to engage young people and adults in dialogues on various art issues. College and Graduate School Internships are available throughout the academic year, offering academic credit. =Multicultural Internships= Multicultural internships are offered by the Education division. They have been designed to prepare students from underserved groups for future employment in the arts through apprenticeships in the Education division. The interns not only gain valuable professional experience but are able to conduct tours. In the Multicultural Internship program, individuals from universities, colleges, and community arts organizations who have an interest in art and education are trained as gallery educators. Interns receive museum training, attend education classes, and experience an introduction to various aspects of curatorial work for exhibitions.

On 4 October 1957, the Sputnik rocket was used to perform the world's first satellite launch, placing Sputnik 1 satellite into a low Earth orbit.NASA, Sputnik 1 russianspaceweb.com Sputnik Sputnik Rocketarchives.gov, Report on Vanguard NASA, Vanguard Tech Notes Mission The main purpose of the Vanguard Test Vehicle launchings was systems testing for the launch vehicle and satellite. The program objectives for the satellite were to conduct micrometeorite impact and geodetic measurements from Earth orbit. Engineering studies included electron charge and temperature of the satellite. The IGY Vanguard satellite program was designed with the purpose of launching one or more Earth-orbiting satellites during the International Geophysical Year (IGY), which ended on 31 December 1958. Launch The launch took place on 5 February 1958 at 07:33 GMT from the Atlantic Missile Range, from LC-18A in Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The initial launch was nominal, but at an altitude of ) a malfunction in a connection between units of the control system or in the first stage servo amplifier resulted in the loss of attitude control. Spurious electrical signals caused-motion of the first stage engine in the pitch plane. At an altitude of about 6.1 km (20,000 feet), 57 seconds into the flight, a violent pitch-down to 45¬∞ resulted in excessive structural and air loads on the launch vehicle, which broke up at the aft end of the second stage at 62 seconds, ending the mission. Spacecraft Vanguard was the designation used for both the satellite and the launch vehicle. The satellite was identical to the Vanguard TV-3 satellite, an approximately 1.5 kg aluminum sphere 16.3 cm in diameter, nearly identical to the later Vanguard 1. A cylinder lined with heat shields mounted inside the sphere held the instrument payload. It contained a set of mercury-batteries, a 10 mW, 108 MHz telemetry transmitter powered by the batteries, and a 5 mW, 108.03 MHz Minitrack beacon transmitter, which was powered by six square (roughly 5 cm on a side) solar cells, manufactured by Bell Laboratories, mounted on the body of the satellite. Six 30 cm long, 0.8 cm diameter spring-actuated aluminum alloy aerials protruded from the sphere. On actuation, the aerial axes were mutually perpendicular to lines that passed through the center of the sphere. The transmitters were primarily for engineering and tracking data, but were also to determine the total electron content between the spacecraft and ground stations. Vanguard also carried two thermistors which could measure the interior temperature in order to track the effectiveness of the thermal protection. A cylindrical separation device was designd to keep the sphere attached to the third stage prior to deployment. At deployment, a strap holding the satellite in place would be released and three leaf springs would separate the satellite from the cylinder and third stage at a relative velocity of about 0.3 m/s. Launch vehicle The first stage of the three-stage Vanguard Test vehicle was powered by a General Electric GE X-405 liquid rocket engine, of of thrust, propelled by of kerosene (RP-1) and LOX, with helium pressurant. It also held of hydrogen peroxide. It was finless, tall, in diameter, and had a launch mass of approximately . The second stage was a high, diameter Aerojet General AJ-10 liquid engine burning Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and White Inhibited Fuming Nitric Acid (WIFNA) with a helium pressurant tank. It produced a thrust of and had a launch mass of approximately . This stage contained the complete guidance and control system. A solid-propellant rocket with of thrust (for 30 seconds burn time) was developed by the Grand Central Rocket Company to satisfy third-stage requirements. The stage was high, in diameter and had a launch mass of . The thin steel casing for the third stage had a hemispherical forward dome with a shaft at the center to support the spacecraft and an aft dome fairing into a steel exit nozzle. The total height of the vehicle with the satellite fairing was about . The payload capacity was to a Earth orbit. A nominal launch would have the first stage firing for 144 seconds, bringing the rocket to an altitude of , followed by the second stage burn of 120 seconds to , whereupon the third stage would bring the spacecraft to orbit. This was the same launch vehicle configuration, with minor modifications, as used for Vanguard TV-3 and all succeeding Vanguard flights up to and including Vanguard SLV-6.

Located in the Old City of Acre, it is one of the prominent projects constructed during the rule of Ahmed Jezzar Pasha in Galilee, under the Ottoman era. History=Ottoman period= Being one of four Khans in Acre, Khan al-Umdan was built in 1784 on the place of the Royal Customs house of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Due to its plethora of columns the khan was named Khan al-Umdan which means \\"Inn of the Columns\\" or \\"Caravanserai of Pillars\\". It incorporates forty columns made of granite that were taken from Caesarea, Atlit and the ruins of Crusader monuments in Acre itself. The clock tower of Khan al-Umdan Due to its proximity to the port, Khan al-Umdan has throughout its history been an important trading spot. Merchants arriving at Acre used the khan as a warehouse while the second floor functioned as a hostel. Camel caravans once brought produce and grain from Galilean villages to the city's markets and port.Dumper and Stanley, 2006, p. 7. The khan later gained importance to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith (as the Kh√°n-i-'Av√°mid) as it was the site where Baha'ullah used to receive guests, and later the site for a Bah√° º√≠ school. In 1906 a clock tower was added adjacent to the main entrance to the khan to commemorate the silver jubilee of the rule of Ottoman sultan Abd al- Hamid II. It is similar to the Jaffa Clock Tower, a building dedicated to the same purpose, along with five more towers in Ottoman Palestine (in Jerusalem, Haifa, Safed, Nablus, and possibly Nazareth) and over a hundred across the entire empire. =Modern era= In 2001 Khan al-Umdan, together with the rest of Acre's old city, was designated as a world heritage site. In 2004 Khan al- Umdan () was featured on a stamp of Israel worth 1.3 sheqels.

It formed part of the defences of the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie 'VOC' replenishment station, which had been established under Jan van Riebeeck in 1652. The purpose of the station was to supply ships travelling between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. The redoubt was armed with two 12-pounder guns, and on 22 April 1654, Van Riebeeck informed the VOC's directors that \\"in addition to the Fort de Goede Hoop, a redoubt named Duijnhoop standing at the Salt River for the protection and reinforcement of this Table Bay, has been fully placed in a position of defence.\\" In addition to covering the approach to the Salt River mouth, Duijnhoop served as a signalling station to warn the Fort of approaching ships. By 1661, Duijnhoop had been abandoned, and fallen into disrepair. It was repaired after a warning that a French fleet might pass the Cape, and a second redoubt, named Santhoop, was built nearby. By 1666, however, both had been allowed to fall into disrepair again. Duijnhoop was demolished in 1672. Nowadays, for some reason, Duijnhoop is sometimes confused with the Fort de Goede Hoop.

Life Born to Protestant parents in Deinze, Flanders and a fervent counter-remonstrant, Baudartius left the Netherlands on the Duke of Alva's arrival, and landed in England at Sandwich. He studied at Canterbury as well as on the continent at Ghent, Leiden, Franeker, and Heidelberg. He served as a preacher at Kampen (1593), Lisse (1596), and Zutphen. Highly knowledgeable in Hebrew, he was asked to take part in the Statenvertaling translation of the Bible. Baudartius was a student under David Pareus, a Professor of Theology at Heidelberg University from 1573 until his death. His colleague from 1589 to 1596 was Jacobus Kimmedonck. He had previously studied under Kimmedonck from 1578 till 1584 at Ghent University. Kimmedonck, then minister at Middleburg in Zeeland, introduced him to the Church of Leiden.

Biography De Ruyter was born in Vlissingen, the son of lieutenant admiral Michiel de Ruyter and his second wife Cornelia Engels. He began his naval service on board his father's ship on his expeditions in 1664 and 1665. Captains often had their sons serve with them, so that they learned their trade while their wages were paid by the Admiralty. In 1666, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Engel was a midshipman in the Admiralty of Amsterdam. He served in the St. James's Day Battle on board Willem van der Zaen's ship, the Gouda. In 1667 he rose to lieutenant-commander. On 1 April 1668 he became captain-extraordinary and in 1669 a captain in ordinary, a permanent post. In 1670 he served under lieutenant-admiral Willem Joseph van Ghent in the expedition against the privateers of Algiers, receiving a reward for his service on that expedition. During the Third Anglo-Dutch War he fought in the battle of Solebay as captain of the Deventer and was wounded in the chest by a splinter. In the winter of 1672/73 he also commanded a company of \\"landmatrozen\\" on the Dutch Water Line as a major. In 1673 he was captain of the Waesdorp in the two battles at the Schooneveld and at the Battle of Texel. His change of command was lucky, since the Deventer went out of service after an accident in the First Battle of the Schooneveld. On 6 October 1673 he was promoted to schout-bij-nacht. During the Franco-Dutch War he was on the 70-gun Spieghel in 1674 during the failed expedition against Martinique. In 1675 he served on convoy escort duty in the Mediterranean and in 1676 he fought in the fleet sent to help Denmark against the Swedes in the Scanian War. On 19 October 1678 he was made vice-admiral and commanded a squadron in the fleet under Cornelis Evertsen de Jonge which was sent to help Spain, fighting the French admiral Chateaurenault. Not as grave as his father, Engel commissioned a biography of him from Gerard Brandt in 1681 and made his father's logbooks more accessible by writing summaries of them. Like his father, he was promoted within the Danish and Spanish nobility, rising to junker and later baron - in the Netherlands he was also known as ridder. In 1680 he bought an estate in Breukelen, naming it the Ruytervegt. He never married and died childless. 1649 births 1683 deaths 17th-century Dutch military personnel Admirals of the navy of the Dutch Republic Dutch naval personnel of the Anglo-Dutch Wars People from Vlissingen ","title":"Engel de Ruyter"},{"id":"21310492","text":"Carex vulpinoidea is a species of sedge known as fox sedge and American fox- sedge.

It functions as a system for organizing a closed legal brief. The CRuPAC format is a \\"closed\\" format that is frequently used in responsive legal pleadings, where the issue has already been properly framed and identified by the movant (often through use of the related IRAC methodology). Some authors have suggested dropping the \\"P\\" section of CRuPAC, which results in only four sections: Conclusion, Rule, Application and Conclusion The Sections of a CRuPAC=Conclusion= The CRuPAC starts by stating the conclusion that the author wishes the reader (or judge) to reach. =Rules= The rules section of a CRuPAC follows the conclusion. The rule section of a CRuPAC is the statement of the rules that govern the particular question. Rules may include statutes, constitutions, the Rules of Civil Procedure, the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Rules of Evidence, etc. The pertinent rule may also be included in Restatements of the Law, or the common law as derived from court case precedent. Which rules are applicable depends entirely on the question being addressed. =Proof= The \\"P\\" in CRuPAC stands for \\"proof\\", although many attorneys sometimes refer to this as the \\"precedent\\" section. In the proof section, the author uses case law to prove how the rule operates and to give examples of how the rule is used. =Application= The application section of a CRuPAC applies the rules developed in the rules section to the specific facts of the issue at hand. It is generally improper to introduce new rules in the Application section. If the rules developed in the rules section include common law decisions, then the most efficient way of applying those rules to the facts is by the method compare and contrast, in which the facts of the cases cited as precedent are compared to the facts in the current litigation. =Conclusion= The (second) conclusion section of a CRuPAC restates the introductory conclusion. It is important that the (second) conclusion not merely copy the introduction verbatim; but rather, that the second conclusion restate the introduction in a compelling manner. It is never proper to introduce new argument or rules in the conclusion. By using two conclusion sections, the CRUPAC applies the maxim: \\"Tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em, then tell 'em what you told 'em.\\" References Acronyms Legal writing ","title":"CRuPAC"},{"id":"21310527","title":"Kizhakku Cheemayile"},{"id":"21310539","text":"The name Ambo has been used in the Philippines by PAGASA in the Western Pacific. * Tropical Depression Ambo (2004) (01W, Ambo) ‚Äì a tropical depression that was only recognized by PAGASA and JTWC. * Typhoon Neoguri (2008) (T0801, 02W, Ambo) * Typhoon Mawar (2012) (T1203, 04W, Ambo) * Tropical Depression Ambo (2016) (Ambo) ‚Äì a tropical depression that was only recognized by PAGASA. * Typhoon Vongfong (2020) (T2001, 01W, Ambo)- a disastrous Category 3 storm that hit the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic, causing over damage causing its name to be retired.

These camps were used for internment of, among others, suspected criminals, German refugees, anarchists and Swedish communists. Military personnel from both sides in the war, if they entered Sweden without prior agreement, were also often subject to internment. The camps were claimed to have been a decision necessary in the ambition to keep Sweden out of the war. It was made by the then-ruling grand coalition government under social democrat prime minister Per Albin Hansson, which all included all parties in the Parliament of Sweden, with the notable exception of the Communist Party of Sweden.

They were not permitted to leave their working station at any time. Jobs like road building, repair duty and woodcutting were commonly adopted. With one break for lunch, work proceeded until 2.45pm, after which internees were more or less free for the rest of the day. Internment of Allied air crews A number of Western Allied servicemen, primarily crew members of the aircraft damaged during bombing missions over Germany, found themselves on Swedish soil, and were interned by the Swedish authorities. Unlike civilian refugees from Germany, who were kept in internment camps, Allied airmen were placed in hotels and bed and breakfast establishments in the Falun area, and enjoyed relative freedom. They received their regular military pay from their home countries, which allowed them to be much better off than the local Swedish residents.J√∂ran Granberg, [Memories of the Framby Internment Camp in Falun Sweden, 1942-1944], 2008 ‚ÄúDisclosure‚Äù In 2008, Swedish journalist Niclas Sennerteg and researcher Tobias Berglund published Swedish Concentration Camps in the Shadow of the Third Reich (Swedish title: ‚ÄúSvenska koncentrationsl√§ger i tredje rikets skugga‚Äù), where they claim to be exposing what the government had kept secret regarding the presence of Swedish concentration camps. After the discovery was brought to media and thus public attention, the use of the term concentration camp has been highly debated.

Rule of Law in a State of Emergency is his third major book in the area of public international law. Career Chowdhury is an activist in the area of international human rights law. As Professor Richard Lillich makes clear in the foreword to the book, the Paris Minimum Standards of Human Rights Norms in a State of Emergency adopted by the International Law Association in 1984 were originally Mr Roy Chowdhury's idea. He chaired the ILA sub-committee that drafted and revised the Paris Minimum Standards. In this book, Mr Roy Chowdhury builds on his work as Chairman of the sub- committee and expands on the Paris Minimum Standards by careful and painstaking analysis of state practice and the work of international monitoring bodies. The Paris Minimum Standards are based on norms derived from international human rights covenants. They are intended to ensure that the rule of law is upheld even after a bona fide declaration of a state of emergency. It follows the format of the ILA report on the Paris Minimum Standards and is divided into three sections. The first section of the book sets forth and analyzes the minimum standards that should be observed with respect to the declaration, duration and control of a national state of emergency. The second section deals with the general principles to be observed with respect to the suspension or limitation of the rights of the individual and the role of the legislature and the judiciary in ensuring the protection of such rights. The third section sets forth and describes the non-derogable rights and freedoms that may not be suspended or limited even during a state of emergency.

It is a collection of five three- family residences located on Windsor Court and adjacent North Street that were built by the American Optical Company between 1915 and 1917 to provide worker housing. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history Windsor Court is a short spur road on the south side of North Street, which runs east‚Äìwest north of Southbridge's downtown and south of the Quinebaug River. Between the road and the river stands part of the former manufacturing facility of the American Optical Company, once Southbridge's leading employer. Two of the five buildings in the district flank Windsor Court, facing south toward North Street, while the other three stand on the west side of Windsor Court. They are essentially identical in original construction, 2-1/2 story wood frame structures with gable roofs. They differ from traditional triple-decker construction in that they have gabled roofs and Colonial Revival styling. Distinctive features include corner pilasters and recessed porches, some of which have since been enclosed. Although the roofline starts at the second floor, the houses have dormers that run most of the length of the structure, giving the third floor unit additional space. These features are similar to those found in another cluster of company housing on Twinehurst Place. These houses typified the densest form of residential housing built by the American Optical Company to house its workers. These buildings were built between 1915 and 1917, and were rented to workers at $7 per month for the lower units, and $6 for the third floor.

Built in 1910 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NYNH&H;), it is a rare local example of Spanish Mediterranean architecture, and is the only surviving railroad building in the town. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 as New York, New Haven & Hartford Passenger Depot. It presently serves as the town's registry for motor vehicles. Description and history The former station is located on a roughly triangular parcel between Southborough's downtown and the Quinebaug River, where much of its industry was historically located. The parcel is bounded on the northeast by the former railroad tracks, the south by Larochelle Way (formerly Depot Street), and on the north and west by Hook Street. It is a single story wood frame structure, built in a Spanish Colonial style, with stucco walls and tile roof. A similarly-roofed passenger waiting area once lined the south side of the track on the platform just north of the station, but this has been removed. Southbridge's railroad service began in 1866, with service provided by the Blackstone and Southbridge Railroad. The track originally extended further to the northwest, nearer the Hamilton Woolen Company mill complex, where there once stood passenger and freight depots and an office building. After a series of mergers, the service was taken over by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1907. This depot was built by that railroad in 1910, and served as a passenger station until 1930. Its style, which is uncommon in any sort of building in central Massachusetts, was somewhat typical for railroad-related infrastructure during the early 20th century.

Philippe Tesson intended for it to be the successor to the daily newspaper Combat, of which he had been the editor-in-chief between 1960 and 1964. Combat included articles and editorials from a variety of opinions, as well as an in-depth coverage of cultural events in Paris. The survival of Le Quotidien de Paris during the 1980s and '90s was largely due to the success of another paper from the same publishing group, Le Quotidien du M√©decin, which was run by Tesson's wife, Marie-Claude Tesson-Millet. In 1991 it distributed 35,000 newspapers across France. Its last issue appeared in 1996.  History  * 4 April 1974 ‚Äì Philippe Tesson launched Le Quotidien de Paris. * 1978 ‚Äì Publication was temporarily suspended, due to limited distribution and financial resources. * 27 November 1979 ‚Äì Reappeared at newsagents, although with a modest distribution, which was viewed as elitist. Had a substantially better financial situation. * 1981 ‚Äì After the first election of Fran√ßois Mitterrand as President of the Republic, Le Quotidien de Paris emerged as one of the only opposition newspapers. Consequently, circulations rose to around 70,000 copies. * 1983 ‚Äì During a protest movement sparked by over private schooling funded by the state, circulation reached over 100,000 copies. * June 1993 ‚Äì During an economic crisis, and a particular bad period for the French press, a refinancing allowed continual publication.

Editorial stance  Le Quotidien de Paris adopted a polemical, but diverse, stance from its inception. It included a number of right-leaning journalists, along with many old journalists from Combat and L'Aurore, which were more left-leaning. Shortly after the election of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, when Tesson adopted his stance with the opposition, several journalists left for Le Matin de Paris and L'√âv√©nement du Jeudi, citing the shift in editorial stance as going against their conscience. From this point on, the paper leaned strongly to the right. After being purchased by Nicolas Miguet, the paper leaned increasingly towards the extreme right, as exemplified by the ideas of Bruno M√©gret, at the time the second in command of the Front national of Jean-Marie Le Pen. None of the journalists still working for the paper remained on the team after this purchase and transition.  Journalists  Le Quotidien de Paris had many journalists, among them Henry Chapier, Claire Chazal, Laurence Coss√©, Pierre Daix, Jean-Pierre Thiollet and √âric Zemmour.

The author of Emar√© is unknown and it exists in only one manuscript, Cotton Caligula A. ii, which contains ten metrical narratives.British Library MS Cotton Caligula A.ii, fols. 71-76. [The early fifteenth-century manuscript consists of two paper quartos, the first of which contains Emar√© and other English verse texts as well as a treatise on pestilence, a prose treatise on the rite of confession, a short Latin chronicle and a few prescriptions. The second quarto contains statutes of the Carthusian order dating from 1411 to 1504.] Emar√© seems to date from the late fourteenth century, possibly written in the North East Midlands.Edith Rickert, The Romance of Emare, EETS e.s. 99 (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner, 1908) The iambic pattern is rather rough.Emar√©: Introduction, Edited by Anne Laskaya and Eve Salisbury, Originally Published in The Middle English Breton Lays, Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1995 It tells a version of the popular \\"Constance-saga\\". Plot summary The text begins with a standard invocation to Christ, but one of uncommon length; it may be the longest one in English romance.Emar√© We are then told of Sir Artyus, an Emperor. His wife gives birth to a beautiful baby girl but dies shortly afterwards. The daughter, Emar√©, is sent to live with a lady named Abro who raises her and teaches her manners and sewing. Some years later, the King of Sicily comes to see the Emperor, bringing with him a beautiful cloth set with precious stones, woven by the daughter of the heathen Emir as a wedding gift to her betrothed. It depicts four scenes of lovers in the corners. The King had won it from the Sultan of Emir in war, and presents it to the Emperor as a gift. The Emperor sends for his now grown up daughter, and, pleased with her beauty, becomes enamored by her. He decides he wants to marry her, and sends to Rome for Papal dispensation to marry his daughter. When the Papal Bull arrives, he has the elaborate cloth tailored into a garment, a kirtle (), for Emar√©. She wears it and is bedazzling in her beauty. The Emperor tells her she is to marry him, but she refuses, saying it is an affront to Christ. He grows angry and has her put out to sea, still in the beautiful kirtle, with no food or drink. A powerful wind blows the boat away. The Emperor, on seeing this, weeps and castigates himself. Emar√© is blown to the kingdom of Galys. The King of that country's steward, Sir Kadore, finds her in the boat. He asks her name and she changes it, telling him it is Egar√©. She is nearly dead with hunger so Sir Kadore takes her to his castle and revives her. He throws a feast for the King at which Emar√© serves, wearing her kirtle. The King is overcome, and later asks Sir Kedore who she is. He tells the King that she is an Earl's daughter from a distant land, and that he sent for her to teach his children courtesy, as well as how to sew, as she is the finest embroiderer he has ever seen. The King then presents Emar√© to his mother. His mother thinks that she is the most beautiful woman in the world, but tells her son that she must be a fiend in a noble robe, and forbids him to marry Emar√©. He ignores his mother, earning him her anger, and weds Emar√© regardless. They have a loving marriage and eventually Emar√© conceives. The King of France, meanwhile, has been besieged by the Saracens, and the King of Galys goes to his aid, leaving his wife, Emar√©, in the care of Sir Kadore. She gives birth to a beautiful son she calls Segramour, and Sir Kadore writes a letter to the King telling him of the event. The messenger stops off at the King's mother's castle on the way. He tells her of the news, and she proceeds to get him drunk. Once he is unconscious, she burns the letter and writes a new one to tell her son that his wife had given birth to a demon. The next day the messenger continues on his way and gives the message to the King. On reading it the King weeps, and curses his fortune. However, he writes a letter ordering Sir Kadore to offer any and all support to Emar√© and to refuse her nothing. The messenger sets off with this message and again stops off at the mother's castle. She again gets him drunk, and again burns the letter, and writes a new one informing Sir Kadore to exile Emar√©. When Sir Kadore receives this letter he is shocked, and swoons. Emar√© hears the lamentation in the hall and asks what the problem is. When Sir Kadore explains, she decides that the King has ordered this because she is not a worthy Queen for him, being a simple lady, and agrees to go into exile. Again, she is put out to sea wearing her kirtle with her baby son. For more than a week she drifts, suckling her son to keep him quiet and cursing the sea, until she arrives at Rome. A merchant of Rome, Jurdan, finds her in her boat. Again, Emar√© names herself as Egar√©, and the merchant takes her and her son into his home. Seven years pass, and the baby has grown into a fine, wise boy. The King of Galys has returned home from the siege, and asks Sir Kadore for news. He grows angry that Sir Kadore does not first tell him about his wife and child, which confuses Kadore, who tells the King that he had followed his orders and exiled them. The King reads the false letter and says that he never wrote it. They interrogate the messenger who says that he stopped at the King's mother's castle. The King is furious and says he will burn her at the stake, but his lords decide instead that she should be exiled, and she flees across the sea. The King decides to go to Rome to seek penance from the Pope. He comes to stay at the same merchant's house who has taken in Emar√©. Emar√© tells her son that the next day, at the feast, he will serve whilst wearing her kirtle, and that he must tell her everything the King says to him. At the feast all admire the boy for his beauty and courtesy. The King asks him his name, and, upon learning it, grows melancholy as it is the same name as his son. He asks the merchant if the child is his, and when the merchant replies that it is, the King offers to adopt him and make him his heir. Segramour goes to his mother and tells him of this, and she tells him to go back to the king and tell him that he should come speak to Emar√©, who changed her name to Egar√© in the land of Galys. He does so, and the King disbelieves him, but follows him anyway. He discovers it is his wife and all rejoice. Meanwhile, Emar√©'s father, the Emperor, now an old man, decides to come to Rome to seek penance in order to get to Heaven. He sends messengers to Rome to let them know he is coming, and Emar√© tells her husband to go meet the Emperor, ride in with him and show him respect, and tells her son to go as well, win the heart of the Emperor, and, once he has arrived, to ask him to come speak with Emar√©. The Emperor cannot believe this, but on meeting Emar√© has a joyful reunion with his daughter, the King and his grandson. The lay ends with Segramour becoming Emperor after his grandfather, and a final thanksgiving to Christ. Sources According to the poem itself, it is based on a French poem, L'√âgar√©, which is very probable; the poem may or may not have been Breton, but √âmar√© does preserve a large number of French terms and proper names.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p28 New York Burt Franklin,1963 Motifs The king who wishes to marry his own daughter is a common motif in both fairy tales and chivalric romances. The commonest form of this in fairy tales is the tale of persecuted heroine, Aarne-Thompson type 510B, such as Allerleirauh, The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter, and The She-bear, where the escaped heroine proceeds to Cinderella-like attend three balls and win a princely husband.Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 64 However, the exact form of this tale‚Äîthe heroine who flees, marries, and is then exiled after accusations at the time of the birth of her child‚Äîis also found in many fairy tales, such as Penta of the Chopped-off Hands, and many fairy tales, such as The Girl Without Hands and The One-Handed Girl, feature the exile, marriage, and second exile while offering a different reason for her alienation from her father.Heidi Anne Heiner, \\"Tales Similar to the Girl Without Hands\\" This tale, and this only, was taken up into romances. It continues the folkloric motifs by having her mother-in-law be the one to persecute her again, by setting her and her baby adrift.Barbara A. Hanawalt, The Ties That Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England p213 The oldest such retelling appears in Vitae Duorum Offarum, naming the king Offa; the king himself appears to be historical, but the details of his kingdom are inaccurate.Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 65-6 A second English version is the \\"Constance\\" tale, in Nicholas Trivet's Chronique Anglo- Normane, the source of both Chaucer's The Man of Law's Tale and John Gower's variant in Confessio Amantis; the common name for this tale type, the innocent accused queen, in romance is the \\"Constance cycle\\".Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p24-5 New York Burt Franklin,1963 Attempts have been made to link it to the Old English The Wife's Lament, but owing to the lack of detail about the cause of the wife's suffering‚Äîneither who the malevolent relatives were, who separated her from her husband, nor what was their accusation‚Äîno definitive connection can be made.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p23 New York Burt Franklin,1963 Unlike many variants of the Constance tale, and unlike the fairy tales, Emare is not mutilated at any point, nor is there any heavenly vengeance on her persecutors.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p26 New York Burt Franklin,1963 Other romances that use the plotline of this fairy tale include Mai and Beaflor, and La Belle Helene de Constantinople.Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 70-1 La Belle Helene de Constantinople indeed features a similar woman raising the heroine. Sir Degar√© also features it, and it also shares motifs with such romances as Lay le Freine, Octavian, Torrent of Portyngale, Sir Eglamour of Artois, Le Bone Florence of Rome, Generides, and the Chevalere Assigne. While Le Bone Florence of Rome suffers because of her wicked brother-in-law who tries to seduce her and abandons her in the forest while she frees him, her tale has many common points with Florence's: both women are noted for their beauty and magnificent clothing, both are taken as evil for it, and both suffer not for their own instruction, being models of virtue, but to demonstrate God's providence.Carol Falvo Heffernan, Le Bone Florence of Rome, p 32-3 , Emare's robe is a key image of the romance. It also resembles the marvelous gowns obtained by the heroines of the fairy tale variants, as in Allerleirauh, Donkeyskin, Catskin, The King Who Wished to Marry His Daughter or The Princess That Wore a Rabbit- skin Dress.Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 74 ReferencesExternal links * Text of Emar√© Lais (poetic form) Middle English poems Romance (genre) 14th-century poems ","title":"Emar√©"},{"id":"21310861","text":"Wolpa Synagogue, 1920, Second Polish RepublicThe Wo≈Çpa Synagogue was a Synagogue in the town of Wo≈Çpa (alternative spellings: Wolpa, Volpe, Wolpe, Wolp, Woupa or Voupa) near Bia≈Çystok, Poland, now in Western Belarus.Carol Herselle Krinsky, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1985, Synagogues of Europe: Architecture, History, Meaning, Dover Publications, 1996, p. 225 ff.

The walls of the main hall were 7.2 meters high. The vaulting, under a three-tiered roof, rose to a height of fourteen meters in three tiers marked by fancy balustrades. Each tier was made up of several curving sections faced in wooden paneling to form a graceful, tiered and vaulted dome. The vaulted ceiling was supported by the four wooden corner columns that rose from the bimah, and by trusses in the roof. The Torah Ark was an elaborate, multi-tiered confection in painted, carved wood, with columns, bas-relief menorahs, vases, floral swags, roofed towers, the tablets of the Ten Commandments and an eagle. In the early nineteenth century, the vaulted ceiling was painted in a \\"dark sapphire\\" color spangled with \\"glistening\\" gold stars. The walls were painted in naive Trompe-l'≈ìil style to resemble a Classical masonry building. Polish Jewish communities were routinely denied permission to build in masonry.Rachel Wischnitzer, The Architecture of the European Synagogue, JPS, Philadelphia, 1964, p. 127 The exterior featured a three-tiered roof and a pair of elaborate corner pavilions with two-tiered roofs over elaborate vaulted ceilings.

Built before 1855, it is a distinctive combination of Greek Revival and Gothic features executed in stone. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history Cliff Cottage is located in Southbridge's Globe Village area, on the north side of Mill Street east of Fisk Street. It is set on a rise above the street that overlooks the Quinebaug River. It is a 1-1/2 story structure, built principally out of stone. The main level of the house is built of paneled stone, and has an asymmetrical T-shaped layout. It has original casement windows, and its roof is punctured by a series of gable end dormers decorated with scallop trim. The porch is in a Greek Revival style. The house is a rare example of Gothic styling in Southbridge. The house was built sometime before 1855, when it first appears on local maps. The combination of Greek Revival and Gothic Revival features suggests that it was built after 1830. The area was then experiencing rapid growth due to the success of the Hamilton Company mills, and this part of Globe Village was developed by the locally prominent McKinstry family. It is not known for whom this house was built; its owner in 1855 was listed as F. McKinstry. It was given a substantial renovation in 2014 and 2015. In 2017, the original barn was razed and replaced.

The metaphor of a funnel is used to describe the way users are guided to the goal with fewer navigation options at each step. Using this metaphor, advertising efforts can be aimed at \\"upper funnel\\", \\"middle funnel\\", or \\"lower funnel\\" potential customers.Jansen, B. J. and Schuster, S. (2011) Bidding on the Buying Funnel for Sponsored Search Campaigns. Journal of Electronic Commerce Research. 12(1), 1-18. Typically a large number of customers search for a product/service or register as page view on a referring page which is linked to the e-commerce site by a banner ad, ad network or conventional link. Only a small proportion of those seeing the advertisement or link actually click the link. The metric used to describe this ratio is the click-through rate (CTR) and represents the top level of the funnel. Typical banner and advertising click-through rates are 0.02% in late 2010 and have decreased over the past three years. Click-through rates are highly sensitive to small changes such as link text, link size, link position and many others and these effects interact cumulatively. The process of understanding which creative material brings the highest click-through rate is known as ad optimization. Once the link is clicked and the visitor to the referring page enters the e-commerce site itself, only a small proportion of visitors typically proceed to the product pages, creating further constriction of the metaphorical funnel. Each step the visitor takes further reduces the number of visitors, typically by 30%‚Äì80% per page. Adding the product to the shopping cart, registering or filling in contact details and payment all further reduce the numbers step-by-step cumulatively along the funnel. The more steps, the fewer visitors get through to becoming paying customers. For this reason, sites with similar pricing and products can have hugely different conversion rates of visitors to customers and therefore greatly differing profits.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The former Dani and Soldani Cabinet Makers and Wood Workers Factory is located north of downtown Southbridge, at the northeast corner of Worcester Street (Massachusetts Route 169) and Vinton Street. It is a modest T-shaped brick structure, two stories in height and covered by a flat roof. Doors and windows are set in segmented-arch openings, and windows have concrete sills. The principal adornment of the exterior is a band of brick corbelling at the roofline. The building was built about 1914 for the Optical Lens Company, a short-lived business apparently seeking to capitalize on the success of the nearby American Optical Company. In 1926 the building was purchased by Eugenio Dani and Giovanni Soldani, Italian immigrants who had started a cabinet-making business at their home on Elm Street in 1912. Their workshop was the first major Italian-originated business in Southbridge. They also make chairs, table, cabinets and tool handles. It continues to used for light industrial manufacturing.

It is the only major Romanesque building to survive in Southbridge. and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. History At the time of its construction, the town had been considering separate buildings to function as town hall and high school, replacing the single Greek Revival building that was serving both purposes (on the site of the present town hall). The town eventually decided, as a cost-saving measure, to build the single building, which served both purposes until a dedicated high school was built in 1927. Classrooms and town offices occupied the first floor, and a large meeting space was on the second floor. The interior underwent some renovations in the 1970s. Architecture The exterior of the building has typical Romanesque styling, with massive stone blocks, large arches, and textured ornamental brickwork. The massing is asymmetrical, with a round clocktower on the left. The entranceway features a two-story arched brick surround over a pair of doorways, each of which is itself surrounded by a stone block arch supported by twin columns. During the period of the Romanesque Revival's popularity, three buildings were built in Southbridge. The other two, a bank building and the YMCA, are no longer standing.

His surname is also sometimes rendered Gendt or Gent.  Early career  Van Ghent was baptised on 14 May 1626, in the church of Winssen. It is assumed he was born the same day. In 1642, he became provost of Elst, as a sinecure. Of noble birth, he made a career in the army from 1645 onwards; he started in the regiment of the Count of Hoorne; in 1648, he was promoted to the rank of captain, serving in said regiment. He first became connected to the navy when during the Northern Wars against Sweden in 1659, he executed a landing on the Danish island of Funen under command of Vice-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter. At that time, Van Gendt was an unsalaried major, commanding a regiment of Walloons. During this campaign, there was a large emphasis on and development of amphibious operations, involving Dutch naval officers like the later Rear-Admiral Frederick Stachouwer and Vice-Admiral Volckert Schram.  Second Anglo-Dutch War = Colonel to captain = On 6 March 1663, Van Ghent was appointed a salaried major. On 3 December 1664, he was promoted lieutenant-colonel and was appointed as the military governor of Hellevoetsluis, the major Dutch naval port. This promotion was put forward by the threat of a new war with the English: in March 1665, Charles II of England indeed declared the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In August 1665, Van Ghent was present on De Ruyter's fleet relieving the Dutch treasure fleet at Bergen after the battle of V√•gen. The same year, he advised the leading politician of the Dutch Republic, Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt, to found a special marine corps, the Regiment de Marine, which was established on 10 December 1665. This is often seen as a precursor of the Dutch Royal Marine Corps. Van Ghent was to be its first commander, carrying the rank of colonel. Together, Van Ghent and De Witt conceived the plan to let a victorious sea battle be followed by an immediate landing on the English coast, in order to destroy the enemy fleet at the Chatham Dockyard while it was under repair and at its most vulnerable. For this purpose on transport ships, a large marine contingent would be kept in reserve, to be employed when the opportunity arose. However, if Van Ghent would in his capacity of commander of the marines and as an army colonel be present on the fleet, this would be too conspicuous, possibly betraying the plan to the English. Therefore, Van Ghent was appointed a naval captain with the Admiralty of the Maze to command the Gelderland. Although it was held in the navy that the rank of captain at sea was indeed equivalent to a colonel, many in the army disagreed and Van Ghent himself was bitterly disappointed to be humiliated by the proud Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Tromp in an incident, insisting that he was formally treated in accordance with his nominal rank. For the same reason of covert operation, Van Ghent's deputy, Vice-Commander of the Marines Lieutenant-Colonel Fran√ßois Palm, was also made a naval captain, on the Kruiningen and the Count of Hoorn was appointed Captain of another ship by the name Gelderland. When the Dutch confederate fleet sailed south to meet the English in the Four Days' Battle, the Gelderland was damaged, even before the fight proper started, by a sudden swell, causing such heavy pitching that the foremast broke. The ship had to be towed to port. To be able to continue commanding the marines, Van Ghent moved to the Utrecht, the covering ship of , De Ruyter's flagship. Though the English fleet was indeed heavily damaged in the battle and was forced to withdraw, the Dutch fleet was in no condition to press the pursuit, let alone execute a complex landing operation. A major setback was the death of schout-bij-nacht (Rear-Admiral) Stachouwer, who had extensive amphibious operations' experience, during the second day of the battle. = Captain to lieutenant-admiral = Six weeks later, the Dutch navy set out again, with the fleet numbering ten flutes carrying the Marines. Main objective was to raid the English fleet, which was still lying in the dock with repairs after the battle. Van Ghent was present on his ship, the Gelderland. Inclement weather, however, prevented the amphibious landing and the English fleet sailed out from the river Thames. Rendered ineffective and in a sense superfluous, the transport ships were left behind near the Continental coast of Flanders and the Dutch navy actively sought battle with the English fleet. In the ensuing St. James's Day Battle, the Gelderland served as the covering ship of De Zeven Provinci√´n and shot off the rigging of the Royal Charles when it attacked the Dutch flagship. Forced to drop anchor as her own sails were in tatters, the Gelderland narrowly was saved from an approaching English fireship by intervention of Jan van Brakel, himself a fireship captain who just happened to pass rowing back with his crew in sloops after having expended his own vessel. The Dutch, having narrowly averted disaster, for the moment abandoned any thought of an amphibious landing. After the battle De Ruyter accused Cornelis Tromp to have been responsible for the defeat. The latter also came under the suspicion of planning a coup d'√©tat and was cashiered on 24 August. De Witt immediately proposed Van Ghent, seen as politically reliable, as a successor; the very same day he was promoted lieutenant-admiral and appointed commanding admiral in the Admiralty of Amsterdam. Van Ghent, not wanting to take sides in this political dispute, at first refused his appointment asking to be excused for his lack of experience. However, Tromp then wrote him a letter in which he made clear he would not hold any grudges against him and pointing out he would be a fool not to make use of such a rare opportunity. Van Ghent now accepted his appointment to the title (shared with two others) of Lieutenant-Admiral of Holland and West- Frisia, thereby jumping two ranks. The high rank would in future also provide a believable alibi for having Van Ghent present in the fleet, without suggesting any planned landing operations. After having served as a squadron commander from 5 September till the middle of October 1666, as part of the national fleet trying to prevent a possible blockade of the Dutch trade lanes, Van Ghent was dispatched as a flotilla commander in April 1667 to block a Scottish fleet presumably aiming to intercept the first convoy to set out from the Texel. Van Ghent set out on his flagship Hollandia (with flag captain Thomas Tobias), commanding a force of 24 ships, to cruise the northern North Sea. In fact no naval action followed, although the entire Scottish militia was mobilised to repel a dreaded Dutch landing. = Raid on the Medway = In May 1667, Van Ghent could finally take part in 'his' amphibious landing, the Raid on the Medway, the success of which was mainly due to his merit. The English fleet was laid up at the docks on the Medway due to financial deficits and was vulnerable to attack. Van Ghent first used the Dolphijn as his flagship, with flag captain Hendrik Vollenhove, having on board deputy to the States of Holland, Cornelis de Witt, for political control. He later moved his flag to the frigate Agatha to attack the docked English ships with a frigate squadron from 21 June 1667. Three of the heaviest English ships of the line were burned down and the Royal Charles was taken as a prize. The battle of Chatham was the greatest naval victory the Dutch would ever gain on the English, and it was the heaviest defeat the English Navy would be dealt in her history. Van Ghent was rewarded by the States-General of the Netherlands with a golden enamelled chalice, showing the event; sadly this priceless piece would be lost in the 18th century when it was trampled by the then-owner in anger when he was obliged to pay a gold-tax. Immediately after having delivered the Royal Charles at Goeree, Van Ghent set out on the Dolphijn to Shetland to escort and protect the Return Fleet, a biannual convoy from the East-Indies, on this occasion commanded by Joan van Dam. At that time his vice-admiral was Johan de Liefde and his rear-admiral Hendrik Brunsveld. He only returned to the Texel, with his escortees, after the Treaty of Breda had been signed on 31 July 1667.  Third Anglo-Dutch War  After the second Dutch war Van Ghent was inactive as an admiral for three years. In 1668 he was a member of the Council of State with the States of Utrecht, the government of that province. From May until November 1670 he carried out operations, in cooperation with an English flotilla commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Allin, against Algerian corsairs, off the coast of West-Africa. Van Ghent's flotilla consisted of thirteen ships, mostly frigates, from the admiralties of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Zealand. His vice-admirals were Johan de Liefde and Cornelis Evertsen the Younger. Six privateers were captured and burnt and two hundred Christian slaves liberated. As a reward Van Ghent received a golden chain worth eight hundred guilders. In 1671 war again threatened with England. That summer the Dutch confederate fleet was largely kept busy training in preparation for the conflict. Van Ghent commanded, with the Gouden Leeuw of 90 cannon as his flagship, the third squadron, largely consisting of frigates. His vice-admiral was Isaac Sweers. King Charles II of England that summer tried to create another flag incident to obtain a pretext to declare war. On 24 August the royal yacht Merlin, carrying the wife of the previous English ambassador in the Republic Sir William Temple to London, deliberately sailed through the Dutch fleet being maintained at anchor off Brill. Both and the Dolphijn saluted firing white smoke, but the Merlin then halted shooting in anger at the Dolphijn. Van Ghent, a personal acquaintance of Temple, let himself be rowed in a boat to the yacht, to inquire why such a hostile attitude was taken. He received the demand that the capital Dutch ships would strike their flag in salute. Indeed, by the 1662 treaty Dutch warships were obliged to salute first, but only when meeting English men-of-war; Van Ghent answered he was uncertain whether a yacht counted as such and that it was not his place to create a legal precedent. Charles now instructed the new ambassador, Sir George Downing, to demand from the States-General of the Netherlands that Van Ghent would be severely punished for this insolence, but these refused. After a diplomatic row lasting half a year, Charles declared war, explicitly referring to this incident. Ghent's tomb effigy in the Domkerk in Utrecht During the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Van Ghent first made an attempt from 24 to 26 May to repeat his earlier success at Chatham, but it soon became clear that the English coast had been sufficiently reinforced to repel any attacks. He then participated in the first major sea fight of the war, the battle of Solebay. Commanding the Dutch vanguard on the Dolphijn, he attacked the Royal James, flagship of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich commanding the squadron of the blue. Standing on deck Van Ghent was hit by a canister shot that cut off his lower left leg below the knee and penetrated his torso at five places. He tumbled forward, as his flag captain Michiel Kindt put it in his log, \\"utterly dead\\". The Royal James was burnt and Montagu drowned. The corpse of Van Ghent was quickly brought back to the Netherlands on the galliot Walvisch. There it was embalmed because Van Ghent had indicated to his family his desire to be buried in the city of Utrecht but this location was at the time still occupied by French forces. In August 1674 sculptor Rombout Verhulst began work on Van Ghent's grave memorial in the St. Martin's Cathedral, finishing in June 1676. Until that time Van Ghent was temporarily interred at Arnhem; he was reburied at some time before late 1680; the precise date is unknown. The grave memorial is still extant. Van Ghent was deeply mourned in the Republic for having been both a brave and a kind, unpretentious man.

This canvas on wood frame model was used extensively by the British & French as well as the American Expeditionary Force in World War I. Its top speed was , produced by a 4-cylinder water- cooled engine. The history of the ambulance begins in ancient times, with the use of carts to transport patients. Ambulances were first used for emergency transport in 1487 by the Spanish forces during the siege of M√°laga by the Catholic monarchs against the Emirate of Granada, and civilian variants were put into operation in the 1830s. Advances in technology throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to the modern self-powered ambulances.  Early patient transport  An FDNY ambulance in 1949 There is evidence of forced transport of those with psychiatric problems or leprosy in ancient times. The earliest record of such an ambulance was probably a hammock-based cart constructed around 900 AD by the Anglo-Saxons. During the Crusades of the 11th century, the Knights Hospitaller set up hospitals to treat pilgrims wounded in their battles in the 'holy land', although there is no clear evidence to suggest how the wounded made their way to these hospitals. The Normans used a litter suspended between horses on two poles. Variations on the horse litter and horse-drawn wagons were used until the 20th century.  Early battlefield treatment  The first record of ambulances being used for emergency purposes relates to the troops of Isabella I of Castile in 1487. The Spanish army of the time was well treated and attracted volunteers from across the continent; and among their benefits were the first military hospitals (ambulancias), although injured soldiers were not picked up for treatment until after the cessation of the battle, resulting in many dying on the field. A major change in usage of ambulances in battle came about with the ambulances volantes designed by Dominique Jean Larrey (1766-1842), who later became Napoleon Bonaparte‚Äôs chief physician. Larrey was present at the battle of Spires, The French Army of the Rhine under the command of Custine captured Speyer on 30 September 1792. between the French and Prussians, and was distressed that wounded soldiers were not picked up by the numerous ambulances (which regulations required to be stationed two and half miles back from the scene of battle) until after hostilities had ceased, so he set about developing a new ambulance system. Having decided against using the Norman system of horse litters, he settled on two- or four-wheeled horse-drawn wagons to transport fallen soldiers from the (active) battlefield after they had received early treatment in the field. Larrey adapted the axle assembly from the French army's horse-drawn artillery (\\"flying artillery\\" ‚Äì ') that made their gun carriages especially maneuverable on uneven terrain, and so christened his ambulances \\"flying ambulances\\" (ambulances volantes). The flying ambulances were first used by the Army of the Rhine in 1793. Larrey subsequently developed similar services for Napoleon's armies, and adapted his ambulances to the conditions; including developing a litter which could be carried by a camel for the 1798-1801 French campaign in Egypt.  Development of civilian services  In civilian ambulances, a major advance was made with the introduction of a transport carriage for cholera patients in London in 1832. The Times newspaper said, \\"The curative process commences the instant the patient is put in to the carriage; time is saved which can be given to the care of the patient; the patient may be driven to the hospital so speedily that the hospitals may be less numerous and located at greater distances from each other\\".  Advances during the American Civil War  A horse-drawn ambulance from the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) More advances in medical care for the military were made during the United States‚Äô Civil War. Union military physicians Joseph Barnes and Jonathan Letterman built upon Larrey‚Äôs work and designed a prehospital care system for soldiers, which used new techniques and methods of transport. They ensured that every regiment possessed at least one ambulance cart, with a two-wheeled design that accommodated two or three patients. These ambulances unfortunately proved to be too lightweight for the task, and were phased out to be replaced by the \\"Rucker\\" ambulance, named for Major General Rucker, which was a four-wheeled design, and was a common sight on battlefield of that war. Other vehicles were pressed into service during the civil war, including a number of steamboats, which served as mobile hospitals for the troops. It was in this period that the practice of transporting wounded soldiers to treatment facilities by railroad was introduced.Kuehl, Alexander E. (Ed.). Prehospital Systems and Medical Oversight, 3rd edition. National Association of EMS Physicians. 2002. @ ch. 1.  Hospital-based services begin  A horse-drawn ambulance outside Bellevue Hospital in New York City, 1895 The first known hospital-based ambulance service was based out of Commercial Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio, (now the University of Cincinnati Medical Center) by 1865. This was soon followed by other services, notably the New York service provided out of Bellevue Hospital. Edward Dalton, a former surgeon in the Union Army, was charged with creating a hospital in lower New York; he started an ambulance service to bring the patients to the hospital faster and in more comfort, a service which started in 1869. These ambulances carried medical equipment, such as splints, a stomach pump, morphine, and brandy, reflecting contemporary medicine. Dalton believed that speed was of the essence, and at first the horses were kept in harness while awaiting a call: within a few months this practice had been replaced with a 'drop,' or 'snap,' harness arrangement, whereby the tack was lowered by pulley from the ceiling straight onto the horse: under either scheme, ambulances were ready to go within 30 seconds of being called.The Ambulance: A History. Ryan Corbett Bell. McFarland & Co., 2009 () The service was very popular and grew rapidly, with the year 1870 seeing the ambulances attend 1401 emergency calls, but twenty-one years later, this had more than tripled to 4392. For the first week of their operation, the ambulances were crewed by the hospital's house-staff, after which the hospital hired Drs. Duncan Lee and Robert Taylor as full-time ambulance surgeons; going forward, the plan was to crew the ambulances with fresh graduates of Bellevue's surgical training program, who would serve for six-month terms and be replaced by new hires from successive graduating classes. This scheme foundered immediately, however, when graduates balked at the schedule and the salary offered: $50 a month, twelve-hour shifts, and one day off every four weeks. Instead, by the end of 1869, the system of staffing the ambulance with residents in training (who could simply be assigned, rather than having to be recruited) was firmly established. As late as 1935, these interns were earning the same $50 a month their grandfathers had received. In 1867, the city of London's Metropolitan Asylums Board, in the United Kingdom, received six horse-drawn ambulances for the purpose of conveying smallpox and fever patients from their homes to a hospital. These ambulances were designed to resemble private carriages, but were equipped with rollers in their floors and large rear doors to allow for a patient, lying on a specially designed bed, to be easily loaded. Space was provided for an attendant to ride with the patient, and the entire patient compartment was designed to be easily cleaned and decontaminated. Anyone willing to pay the cost of horse hire could summon the ambulance by telegram or in person.  Dedicated services begin  In 1880, the President of the Liverpool Medical Institution, Reginald Harrison, suggested a horse-drawn ambulance for the city. In 1884, this ambulance service was created based at the Liverpool Northern Hospital: it was the first in Britain. In June 1887 the St John Ambulance Brigade was established to provide first aid and ambulance services at public events in London. It was modelled on a military-style command and discipline structure. The St John Ambulance Association had already been teaching first aid to the public for 10 years prior to that. National or state based branches of St John Ambulance now provides ambulance and first aid services in many countries around the world. In Ireland the St John Ambulance was set up in 1903 in the Guinness Brewery in St. James Gate in Dublin by Doctor, later Sir, John Lumsden for workers. In 1910 the Brigade began its first public duty at the Royal Dublin Society. During the 1916 rising and (after becoming the independent St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland) the 'Emergency' (World War II) the brigade acted as an ambulance service and remained so until the set up of Regional Ambulance Services. In 1938 the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps was set up in Galway. In the years since this voluntary service has gone from strength to strength and is now Ireland's largest voluntary ambulance service and one of Ireland's largest charities. In Queensland, Australia, military medic Seymour Warrian called a public meeting in Brisbane and established an ambulance service after witnessing an event at the Brisbane showgrounds during Show Week in 1892. A fallen rider, suffering a broken leg was walked off the field by well-meaning but misguided bystanders, worsening his injury. As a result of the meeting, the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade was formed on the 12 September. The first ambulance station in Queensland operated out of the Brisbane Newspaper Company and officers on night duty slept on rolls of newspaper on the floor. They had a stretcher, but no vehicle and transported patients on foot, although in time, they gained horse-drawn stretchers and eventually vehicles. A year after the establishment of the Brisbane centre, another was established in Charters Towers in north Queensland, growing to over 90 community controlled ambulance centres. In 1991 the independent QATB centres amalgamated to form the Queensland Ambulance Service which is now the fourth largest ambulance service in the world.  Mass transit use for emergency medical provision  In the late 19th century cities, including Bahia, Brazil and St Louis, Missouri, United States started using trolley cars on their tram network which were designed to act as ambulances, transporting the sick and injured. The trolley cars in Bahia included a fumigating compartment and a two-bed nurses work area. The design of the tram network in St Louis was such that the ambulance streetcar, introduced in 1894 was able to reach all 16 infirmaries in the city. In Germany, in 1902, a civilian ambulance train was introduced (building on the use of trains during military conflict) for use during railway accidents. It housed a mobile operating room and eight stretchers. Railroad employed surgeons lived near the railway station where the ambulance train was stationed, and were summoned to urgently attend in the event of an emergency. This train had priority over the tracks, with all other trains obliged to give way.  Introduction of motor units  Meteor ambulance In the late 19th century, the automobile was being developed, and started to be introduced alongside horse-drawn models; early 20th-century ambulances were powered by steam, gasoline, and electricity, reflecting the competing automotive technologies then in existence. However, the first motor- powered ambulance was brought into service in the last year of the 19th century, with the Michael Reese Hospital, Chicago, taking delivery of the first automobile ambulance, donated in February 1899 by 500 prominent local businessmen. This was followed in 1900, by New York City, which extolled its virtues of greater speed, more safety for the patient, faster stopping and a smoother ride. These first two automobile ambulances were electrically powered with motors on the rear axle. The first gasoline-powered ambulance was the Palliser Ambulance, introduced in 1905, and named for Capt. John Palliser of the Canadian Militia. This three-wheeled vehicle (one at the front, two at the rear) was designed for use on the battlefield, under enemy fire. It was a heavy tractor unit, cased in bulletproof steel sheets. These steel shields opened outwards to provide a small area of cover from fire (nine feet wide by high) for the ambulance staff when the vehicle was stationary. The British Army followed quickly behind the Canadians in introducing a limited number of automobile ambulances. In 1905, the Royal Army Medical Corps commissioned a number of Straker-Squire motor ambulance vans. They were based on a double- decker bus manufactured by the same company, although on a shorter wheelbase. A number of them were based in Oxfordshire, serving several major encampments in the area. The first mass-production automobile-based ambulance (rather than one-off models) was produced in the United States in 1909 by the James Cunningham, Son & Company of Rochester, New York, a manufacturer of carriages and hearses. This ambulance, named the Model 774 Automobile Ambulance, featured a proprietary , 4-cylinder internal combustion engine. The chassis rode on pneumatic tires, while the body featured electric lights, a suspended cot with two attendant seats, and a side-mounted gong.McCall, Walter MP. 2002. \\"The American Ambulance\\", Iconografix  World War I  During World War One, the Red Cross brought in the first widespread battlefield motor ambulances to replace horse-drawn vehicles, a change which was such a success, the horse- drawn variants were quickly phased out. In civilian emergency care, dedicated ambulance services were frequently managed or dispatched by individual hospitals, though in some areas, telegraph and telephone services enabled police departments to handle dispatch duties. The equipment carried by the ambulance was changing fast at this time. Traction splints were introduced during World War I, and were found to have a positive effect on the morbidity and mortality of patients with leg fractures. Two-way radios became available shortly after World War I, providing more efficient radio dispatch of ambulances. Shortly before World War II, then, a modern ambulance carried advanced medical equipment, was staffed by a physician, and was dispatched by radio. It was frequently found that ambulances were hearses ‚Äì the only available vehicle that could carry a recumbent patient ‚Äì and were thus frequently run by funeral homes. These vehicles which could serve for either purpose were known as combination cars.  Air ambulances  Australian Flying Doctor Service vehicles in 1954 During World War One, aviation moved from experimentation to a powerful military force, and following the war, with a surplus of aircraft in circulation, new uses were found for the aircraft. This included the conversion of planes throughout the world into ambulance planes. Although in 1917, Lieutenant Clifford Peel, a medical student, outlined a system of fixed-wing aircraft and ground facilities designed to provide medical services to the Australian Outback; the first custom-built air ambulances did not come into existence until the late 1920s. These ideas became reality under the guidance of the Very Reverend John Flynn in 1928 when the Australian Inland Mission service established the Aerial Medical Service, a one-year experimental program. Physicians in this program had several responsibilities, one of which was to fly out to a patient, treat the patient, and fly the patient to a hospital if the physician could not deliver adequate care on scene. Eventually, this experiment became the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia.  World War II  A German ambulance of the World War II era In much of the world, ambulance quality fell sharply during the Second World War, as physicians, needed by the armed services, were pulled off ambulances. In the United Kingdom, during the Battle of Britain, the need for ambulances was so great that vans were commandeered and pressed into service, often carrying several victims at once. Following the war, physicians would continue to ride ambulances in some countries, but not in others. Other vehicles, including civilian and police cars were pressed into service to transport patients due to a lack of a dedicated resource.King, Dean. Patrick O'Brian: a Life. Owl Books. 2001 @ p. 81 Military ambulances such as the Austin K2/Y were used both in the combat areas and on the Home Front. The American Dodge 3/4-ton WC-54 became the standard allied ambulance in front- line units. The Dodge 1/2 ton 9 18 27 became standard around bases overseas and in the States. They also saw combat in Africa and through parts of Europe and the Pacific.  The Korean War  During the Korean War, the newly created United States Air Force produced a number of air-ambulance units for use in forward operating medical units, using helicopters for rapid evacuation of patients. The H-13 Sioux helicopter, made famous by the film and television versions of M*A*S*H, transported 18,000 wounded soldiers during the conflict. The work of the Medical Air Evacuation Squadrons was a success and was repeated by U.S. forces in Vietnam. The use of helicopters for emergency medical evacuations extended to civilian practice by groups such as the Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society.  Move to on-scene care  A 1964 police cruiser, which is also fitted to transport patients After the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash in 1952, ambulances in Britain were restructured to be a \\"mobile hospital\\", rather than just transporting patients, thus leading to modern ambulances. CPR was developed and accepted as the standard of care for out-of- hospital cardiac arrest; defibrillation, based in part on an increased understanding of heart arrhythmias, was introduced, as were new pharmaceuticals to be used in cardiac arrest situations; in Belfast, Northern Ireland, a mobile coronary care ambulance successfully resuscitated patients using these technologies; and well-developed studies demonstrated the need for overhauling ambulance services. These studies placed pressure on governments to improve emergency care in general, including the care provided by ambulance services. Part of the result was the creation of standards in ambulance construction concerning the internal height of the patient care area (to allow for an attendant to continue to care for the patient during transport), and in the equipment (and thus weight) that an ambulance had to carry. A 1973 Cadillac Miller-Meteor ambulance. Note the higher roof, with more room for the attendants and patient, and the increased number of warning lights. Few, or perhaps none of the then-available ambulances could meet these standards. Ambulance design therefore underwent major changes in the 1970s. High-topped car-based ambulances were developed, but car chassis proved unable to accept the weight and other demands of the new standards; van (and later, light truck) chassis would have to be used instead. The early van-based ambulances looked very similar to their civilian counterparts, having been given a limited amount of emergency vehicle equipment such as audible and visual warnings, and the internal fittings for carrying medical equipment, most notably a stretcher. As time went on, ambulances matured in parallel to the newly developed EMS, gaining the capacity to carry additional equipment (both portable and permanently installed) as EMTs and paramedics added this equipment to their arsenal. Ambulance design also evolved to reflect the ergonomics and other human factors of emergency medical care (for instance, raising the roof higher than typical for a van). Advances in the technology and understanding of emergency vehicle equipment also continued to influence ambulance design, just as it did for police and fire-suppression vehicles.  Modern vehicles  Israeli EMS's contemporary civilian armored mobile intensive care unit. Used for response to difficult situations, it incorporates a customized rear compartment on a super-duty Ford E-450 chassis Modern ambulances are now often custom-built, and as well as the specialist medical equipment now built into the ambulances, industry-wide improvements in vehicle design have had an impact, including improvements in audible and visual warning equipment to help protect crews in vulnerable situations (such as at a road traffic collision), and general improvements such as ABS, which are particularly valuable for ambulances, due to the speeds reached and the weight carried. There have also been improvements to help safeguard the health and welfare of ambulance crews, such as the addition of patient tail lifts, ramps and winches, to cut down on the amount of manual handling a crew must perform. Ambulance design is still evolving, largely due to the growing skills and role of paramedics and other ambulance crew, which require specialist equipment. Other factors driving improvement include the need to help protect ambulance crews from common accidents, such as traffic collisions and rarer, but potentially catastrophic incidents such as terrorist activities.

It is 2-1/2 stories in height, with three equipment bays occupying most of the ground floor. To their left is a corner tower, capped by a mansard-style roof, with a pedestrian entrance set in a recess at its base. Most doors and windows are set in segmented-arch openings, and there is a round window at the center of the front gable. The building corners are adorner with brick pilasters, and a line of brick corbelling is set under the roof eave. The station was built in 1894, and was the second permanent home for the Globe Village Fire Company, which had been founded in 1832. The first building for this company was built in 1860, and stood on the north side of Main Street.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 22, 1989. It was gifted to Harrington Memorial Hospital and now houses Harrington Health System offices. Description and history The Academie Brochu is located on the east side of Pine Street, south of its junction with Hamilton Street in central Southbridge. It is a three-story brick structure, set on a raised stone foundation, with a hip roof. Its red brick walls are contrasted by limestone and yellow brick trim, and a metal cornice and frieze below the roofline. The academy was constructed in 1899 by Chickering & O'Connell of Springfield in a Colonial Revival style to serve the growing French Canadian population of Southbridge. The academy was named for Msgr. George Elzear Brochu, pastor of the Notre Dame Church, who gave personal funds to the effort. The academy served as the parish school for Notre Dame Parish, and was run first by the Sisters of St. Anne, and then by the Sisters of the Assumption from Nicolet, Quebec. The school had been established in 1881, and was by the late 1890s in need of proper quarters. The academy building has six classrooms on each of the first two floors, and a chapel on the third floor that is large enough to hold the entire school population. The Colonial Revival styling is at odds with the more traditional French styling of the neighboring church, but it is still one of the most imposing buildings in the town.

It consists of a collection of houses and barns, as well as a cemetery, at the intersection of North Woodstock and Tipton Rock Roads. Its name comes from the early settlers of the area, who included families named Morse and Bacon. The area once also included a tavern and a schoolhouse, but these were demolished some years ago. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Buildings The most notable structure in the district is the c. 1750 Freeman-Pratt House, which is one of the best-preserved Federal style farmhouses in Southbridge. The oldest portion of the house is a 1-1/2 story five section that is now an ell on a two-story main structure. The house features a fanlight over the front door, with pilasters and sidelights surrounding the door. A barn from the 19th century also survives on the property. In addition to the Freeman- Pratt House, there are 4 other houses in the district, two of which are Greek Revival, one is Late Victorian, and the last is a 1910 construction of unidentified style. The Morse Cemetery, formally established in 1789, is estimated to contain over 200 graves, many predating 1840. History This area was settled in the mid-18th century by members of the Bacon, Morse, and Pratt families. By 1830, there was a cluster of six houses near the road intersection, along with a school, established about 1772. The area remained largely agricultural into the 20th century, acquiring as industry a lumber yard in the late 19th century.

From the homotopy-theoretical viewpoint, an assembly map is a universal approximation of a homotopy invariant functor by a homology theory from the left. From the geometric viewpoint, assembly maps correspond to 'assemble' local data over a parameter space together to get global data. Assembly maps for algebraic K-theory and L-theory play a central role in the topology of high-dimensional manifolds, since their homotopy fibers have a direct geometric interpretation. Equivariant assembly maps are used to formulate the Farrell‚ÄìJones conjectures in K- and L-theory. Homotopy-theoretical viewpoint It is a classical result that for any generalized homology theory h_* on the category of topological spaces (assumed to be homotopy equivalent to CW-complexes), there is a spectrum E such that :h_*(X)cong pi_*(X_+wedge E), where X_+:=Xsqcup {*}. The functor Xmapsto X_+ wedge E from spaces to spectra has the following properties: * It is homotopy-invariant (preserves homotopy equivalences). This reflects the fact that h_* is homotopy-invariant. * It preserves homotopy co-cartesian squares. This reflects the fact that h_* has Mayer-Vietoris sequences, an equivalent characterization of excision. * It preserves arbitrary coproducts. This reflects the disjoint-union axiom of h_*. A functor from spaces to spectra fulfilling these properties is called excisive. Now suppose that F is a homotopy-invariant, not necessarily excisive functor. An assembly map is a natural transformation alphacolon F^%to F from some excisive functor F^% to F such that F^%(*)to F(*) is a homotopy equivalence. If we denote by h_*:=pi_*circ F^% the associated homology theory, it follows that the induced natural transformation of graded abelian groups h_*to pi_*circ F is the universal transformation from a homology theory to pi_*circ F, i.e. any other transformation k_*topi_*circ F from some homology theory k_* factors uniquely through a transformation of homology theories k_*to h_*. Assembly maps exist for any homotopy invariant functor, by a simple homotopy-theoretical construction. Geometric viewpoint As a consequence of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, the value of an excisive functor on a space X only depends on its value on 'small' subspaces of X, together with the knowledge how these small subspaces intersect. In a cycle representation of the associated homology theory, this means that all cycles must be representable by small cycles. For instance, for singular homology, the excision property is proved by subdivision of simplices, obtaining sums of small simplices representing arbitrary homology classes. In this spirit, for certain homotopy-invariant functors which are not excisive, the corresponding excisive theory may be constructed by imposing 'control conditions', leading to the field of controlled topology. In this picture, assembly maps are 'forget-control' maps, i.e. they are induced by forgetting the control conditions. Importance in geometric topology Assembly maps are studied in geometric topology mainly for the two functors L(X), algebraic L-theory of X, and A(X), algebraic K-theory of spaces of X. In fact, the homotopy fibers of both assembly maps have a direct geometric interpretation when X is a compact topological manifold. Therefore, knowledge about the geometry of compact topological manifolds may be obtained by studying K and L-theory and their respective assembly maps. In the case of L-theory, the homotopy fiber L_%(M) of the corresponding assembly map L^%(M)to L(M), evaluated at a compact topological manifold M, is homotopy equivalent to the space of block structures of M. Moreover, the fibration sequence : L_%(M)to L^%(M)to L(M) induces a long exact sequence of homotopy groups which may be identified with the surgery exact sequence of M. This may be called the fundamental theorem of surgery theory and was developed subsequently by William Browder, Sergei Novikov, Dennis Sullivan, C. T. C. Wall, Frank Quinn, and Andrew Ranicki. For A-theory, the homotopy fiber A_%(M) of the corresponding assembly map is homotopy equivalent to the space of stable h-cobordisms on M. This fact is called the stable parametrized h-cobordism theorem, proven by Waldhausen- Jahren-Rognes. It may be viewed as a parametrized version of the classical theorem which states that equivalence classes of h-cobordisms on M are in 1-to-1 correspondence with elements in the Whitehead group of pi_1(M).

Built in 1899, it was Southbridge's second fire house (after the Globe Village Fire House) to be built in the 1890s, and serves as the fire department headquarters. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Elm Street Fire House is located on the west side of Elm Street, just south of Main Street and Southbridge's main business district. It is a two-story brick structure, with a hip roof and a tall hose-drying tower at its northeast corner. The building is architecturally eclectic, exhibiting a mixture of Revival styles popular in the late 19th century. The tower is Italianate, with round-arch windows and a bracketed pyramidal roof with skirt. The equipment bays on the ground floor have rusticated brick voussoirs, shaping round-arch openings in three of the bays, and a segmented-arch opening in one. The second story has round-arch windows in its central bays, and rectangular sash windows at the southern end, all with keystones. Dormers in the hip roof have Gothic- arched gables. A single-story addition extends to the south, adding several more equipment bays. Southbridge's fire services began with a tub engine owned by the Hamilton Woolen Mill Company, the city's dominant business. In 1832 the city acquired its own engine, and established a volunteer force to operate both units. The #1 unit occupied a variety of spaces in the center until 1860, when the first station was built. The fire department was formally established in 1880, and water was provisioned to hydrants in the city in the 1890s. Two stations were built in the 1890s: the Globe Village Fire House in 1894, and this one in 1899. This station was designed by Worcester architect George H. Clemence, whose previous commissions included some of that city's fire houses. Clemence is also credited with other designs in Southbridge, where was known to maintain an office, but the bulk of his best-known work is in Worcester.

The ROS handles Guidance, Navigation, and Control for the entire Station. Current composition The segment currently consists of five modules, which together essentially comprise the base configuration of the cancelled Russian space station Mir-2. The segment is controlled directly from Roskosmos's Mission Control Center in Moscow. The five modules are (in order of launch): * Zarya (dawn) * Zvezda (star) * Pirs (pier) * Poisk (search) * Rassvet (sunrise, dawn) The first module, Zarya, otherwise known as the Functional Cargo Block or FGB, was the first component of the ISS to be launched, and provided the early station configuration with electrical power, storage, propulsion, and navigation guidance, until a short time after the Russian service module Zvezda docked and was transferred control. Zvezda contains the ESA built DMS-R Data Management System. Now primarily used for storage, Zarya provides ports for Soyuz spacecraft, Progress (spacecraft) and the European ATV to dock to the station. Ships boosting the station's orbit dock to the aft port (the rear port according to the station's normal orientation and direction of travel). The FGB is a descendant of the TKS spacecraft designed for the Russian Salyut program. 5.4 tons of propellant fuel can be stored and transferred automatically to and from ships docked. Zarya was originally intended as a module for the Russian Mir space station, but was not flown as of the end of the Mir-1 program. Developed by Russia and the former Soviet Union, construction of Zarya was funded by the United States and NASA, and Zarya remains a US-owned module. The second module, Zvezda, is the station's Service Module - it provides a living environment for the crew, contains the ISS's main engine system, and provides a docking port for Soyuz, Progress and Automated Transfer Vehicle spacecraft. The third module, Pirs, functions as the ROS's airlock, storing EVA spacesuits and providing the equipment necessary for cosmonauts to exit the space station. It also serves as a docking compartment for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft. The fourth module, Poisk, is similar to Pirs. Redundancy in airlocks allows one airlock to be repaired internally and externally whilst crew use the other airlock to exit and re-enter the station. The fifth module, Rassvet, is primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft. Future modules=Nauka= Nauka (; lit. Science), also known as the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM) or FGB-2, (Russian: –ú–Ω–æ–≥–æ—Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ª–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–Ω—ã–π –º–æ–¥—É–ª—å, or –ú–õ–ú), is the major Russian laboratory module which will take the place of Pirs. In October 2011, it was reported that Nauka was expected to be launched in December 2013. Prior to the arrival of the MLM, a Progress robotic spacecraft will dock with Pirs, depart with that module, and both will be discarded and burn up in the atmosphere. Nauka will then use its own engines to attach itself to the ROS. This module was intended to separate from the ISS before de-orbit with support modules and become the OPSEK space station, in 2017 Roscosmos announced that it had no further intention to separate the ROS from the ISS in the future, and will continue working with its partners. It contains an additional set of life support systems and orientation control. Power provided by its solar arrays will mean the ROS no longer relies on power from the USOS main arrays. The launch date has now slipped for many years, the next possible date is in November 2019. Naukas mission has changed over time. During the mid-1990s, it was intended as a backup for the FGB, and later as a universal docking module (UDM). Its docking ports will be able to support automatic docking of both space craft, additional modules and fuel transfer. On January 23, 2020, TASS reported that the roll out was postponed until the end of March to replace valves on Nauka's fuel tanks.https://tass.ru/kosmos/7585127 On February 4, 2020 Dmitry Rogozin said Nauka required more testing because the warranty had expired and testing could only be done in Moscow instead of Kazakhstan delaying launch to January 2021.

Due to concerns over coronavirus disease 2019, work has been suspended until April 15th, but systems testing will be performed by a skeleton crew until work resumes.https://tass.com/science/1139385 = Oka-T-MKS = The Oka- T-MKS was a planned companion module to the ISS. Reported to be under construction, its development has been significantly delayed. The module would be free-floating most of the time as an autonomous orbital space laboratory for the conduction of experiments, and dock with the ISS for experiment maintenance about every 180 days. The Oka-T-MKS space laboratory was contracted to Energia by Roscosmos in 2012. Originally projected for a 2015 launch date, this has been pushed back indefinitely and some evidence suggests that, unable to locate significant development partnerships, its development has been abandoned.https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/oka-t.htm  Proposed modules  On June 17, 2009, the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos) presented to NASA and the other ISS partners a proposal to add additional modules to the Russian segment to ensure its viability past 2016 or even 2020. To this end, a Nodal Module that would be attached to the nadir docking port of Nauka (MLM) would facilitate the attachment of two additional, larger modules that would be capable of providing an independent power source to the Russian segment should current plans to deorbit the US segment of the ISS after 2016 move forward. As proposed, the Nodal Module would be launched during 2013 by a Soyuz launcher in a similar fashion to how the Pirs and Poisk MRM-2 modules were lifted to orbit. The two larger modules, nominally referred to as Scientific and Power Producing Modules 1 and 2, would be lifted to orbit via Proton launchers in 2014 and 2015, respectively. These two modules would be attached to the port and starboard sides of the Nodal Module, leaving its aft docking port accessible for possible future expandability and its nadir port accessible for docking by Soyuz or Progress spacecraft. Because of the proximity of the Nodal Module to the planned attachment point of MRM-1 on the nadir docking port of Zarya FGB to facilitate docking of Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, the module's forward-facing port will be unusable.

These TMC's are square shaped boxes that have buttons for each direction of traffic flow. For example, east bound traffic entering an intersection has a button for those vehicles that turn, left, right or continue straight. Furthermore, an additional button is used for each direction to add the number of pedestrian and bicyclist movement. Typically automated traffic counters assess traffic flows, however, due to the differing angles of vehicles entering an intersection the present technology available is not able to quantify the traffic without major error. Traditional automated traffic counters have rubber tubes which are laid out across the road generally in a straight portion in order to have the wheels on the same axle hit at about the same time. When turning in an intersection the tires hit individually and the amount of error in the counter is increased. This means that TMC's are the only present option for quantifying traffic flows. They are used manually by an individual pressing the correlating button for every vehicle that enters and moves through the intersection. TMC's are generally used to determine whether the intersection needs a traffic light. Equations are used to decide whether the volume of the traffic determines that a light is needed. This equation is based on the road classification, entering speed and pedestrian/bicyclist movement through the intersection. A total of eight hours of turning movement is generally mandated for this type of assessment. References *Murthy, Narasimha & Henry R.

The PSID measures economic, social, and health factors over the life course of families over multiple generations. Data have been collected from the same families and their descendants since 1968. It has been claimed that it is the world‚Äôs longest running household panel survey.McGonagle, K. A., Schoeni, R. F., Sastry, N., & Freedman, V. A. (2012). The Panel Study of Income Dynamics: overview, recent innovations, and potential for life course research. Longitudinal and life course studies, 3(2). Background The PSID gathers data about the circumstances of the family as a whole and about each individual in the family. The greatest level of detail is gathered for the primary adult(s) heading the family. The PSID has achieved high and consistent response rates, and because of low attrition and the success in following young adults as they form their own families, the sample size has grown from 4,800 families in 1968, to 7,000 families in 2001, to 7,400 by 2005, and to more than 9,000 as of 2013. By 2003, the PSID had collected information on more than 65,000 individuals. As of 2013, the PSID had information on over 75,000 individuals, spanning as many as 4 decades of their lives. Framework The structure of the PSID started with two distinct samples. A nationally representative sample designed by the Survey Research Center became known as the SRC sample. A second sample of individuals was drawn from lower income levels, and this became known as the Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO) sample. This second sample, though not nationally representative, allowed for more studies to investigate poverty in the United States. After this initial 1968 interview, families were interviewed each year until 1997. After 1997, the survey has been biennial, with data being collected every two years. Over time, as individuals leave their household, they are followed as they form their new residence. As time passed, the representativeness of the original sample became more and more out of line with the overall US demographic. To ameliorate the potential bias, two additional samples were added to the PSID. A third sample consisting of Latinos was added. In 1997, a new fourth Immigrant sample was added, and the other three reorganized. All three continued to be collected, but with a reduced number of households. The two \\"core\\" samples (SRC and SEO) were reduced to include 6,168 families, and the Latino sample was reduced to 2000 families. To these, a new set of 441 families from the Immigrant sample created a study group capable of tracking the current demographics in the US. Until 1972, interviews were done in person using paper. Since 1973 interviews are by phone. Starting in 1993, interviews were conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone (CAT) technology. = Child Development Supplement = The Child Development Supplement (CDS) is a research component of the PSID. The CDS provides researchers with extensive data on children and their extended families with which to study the dynamic process of early human and social capital formation. The first CDS study included up to two children per household who were 0 to 12 years old in 1997, and followed those children over three waves, ending in 2007-08. The CDS 2014 includes all eligible children in PSID households born since 1997. = Transition into Adulthood Supplement = When children in the CDS cohort reach 18 years of age, information is obtained about their circumstances through a telephone interview completed shortly after the Main Interview. This study, called Transition into Adulthood Supplement, has been implemented in 2005, and biennially thereafter. Information includes measures of time use, psychological functioning, marriage, family, responsibilities, employment and income, education and career goals, health, social environment, religiosity, and outlook on life. = File structure of the PSID = The PSID's information is held in many files. The main head and wife responses are held in a series of \\"Family Files\\" that are uniquely identified by a Family ID number. A smaller subset of information pertaining to individuals (whether they are a head, wife, or other family unit members) is contained in the cross-year individual file, and each record is uniquely identified by a 1968 Family ID and Person Number pair. Many additional supplemental files are available with supplemental information that may have been collected for only one or a few years. = Topical information = The PSID collects data on a wide array of social, demographic, health, economic, geospatial and psychological data. As of 2009, the 75 minute interview collected data on: * employment * earnings * income from all sources * expenditures covering 100% of total household spending * transfers * housing * education * geospatial data * health status * health behaviors * health insurance * early childhood and adult health conditions and their timing * emotional well-being * life satisfaction * mortality and cause of death * marriage and fertility * participation in government programs * financial distress including problems paying debt such as mortgages and foreclosure * vehicle ownership * wealth * pensions, and * philanthropy. Many of these areas have been included in the instrument since 1968. Hundreds of additional variables that fall into other domains have been collected in various waves throughout the history of the PSID. No identifying information is distributed to data users and the identity of all respondents is held in confidence. Approximately 3,200 peer-reviewed publications ‚Äì one every 2.5 days ‚Äì are based on PSID data published in the fields of economics, sociology, demography, psychology, child development, public health, medicine, education, communications, and others.

Originally Le R√©duit, it was built as a fortress for defence against attack by Pierre F√©lix Barthelemy David in 1749. The mansion is in R√©duit, Moka, near of the University of Mauritius and the end of the Plaines Wilhems District. It used to serve as the residence for former governors of Mauritius, but now it is the residence of the President. It is built on of land. The ch√¢teau has a garden where a multitude of flowers grow, as well as exotic and native trees. The ch√¢teau is open to the public two days a year, in October and March. The house has persisted through history; it was destroyed by a cyclone, rebuilt, and has been renovated since. It is also used by the military. History=Construction and French rule= Le R√©duit, circa 1880s-1890s Pierre F√©lix Barthelemy David, successor of Bertrand Mah√© de Labourdonnais, took office as Governor of the Isle de France on 8 October 1746 during a time of Anglo-French rivalry for colonial possessions in the Indian Ocean. His main goals was to take measures to fortify the island against an enemy attack. In a letter dated 28 March 1748, addressed to the management of the \\"Compagnie des Indes\\", he expressed his fears and anxiety to find a place in the interior of the island where access would be difficult and where a fortress could be built. This would protect women and valuables. The Governor went into action before even receiving a reply from the authorities as he considered it necessary for the fortress to be completed quickly. David settled on an ideal site ‚Äì a spur in the Moka Range, triangular in shape between steep gorges of the rivers Profonde and Cascade. However, in July 1748, Edward Boscawen, an English vice- admiral commanding an English fleet, approached Mauritius with intentions to take possession of it. He retreated because of French cannons situated at Petite Rivi√®re. The French Company finally authorised David's project, aware of the attack. Under the direction of David, his \\"Le R√©duit\\", a small fortress with battlements and a drawbridge, was completed in 1749. In 1754, one of the directors of the \\"Compagnie des Indes\\", Mr. Godeheu d'Igoville had doubted that Le R√©duit would be able to withstand sustained attacks, although he admired David's work. Under the administration of his successor, Jean Baptiste Charles de Lozier-Bouvet, botanist Jean-Baptiste Christophe Fus√©e-Aublet created the French garden of Le R√©duit and later introduced many rare plants from America, Asia and Europe. Pepper plants and cinnamon trees were added by Antoine Marie Desforges-Boucher, last governor of the \\"Compagnie des Indes\\". The Island became the property of France in 1764 and Le R√©duit became the official residence of the governors, the first of whom was Jean Daniel Dumas. Despite many modifications made during the period 1764‚Äì1778 the Ch√¢teau was in ruins in 1778 due to white ants. Antoine de Guiran La Brillane, then governor, started reconstruction which was completed that year. A year later, on 28 April 1779, La Brillane died in Le R√©duit. An inscription dated 1778 on the main door commemorates the reconstruction. Successive governors followed La Brillane until 1810, when the English took possession of the island. The last French governor was Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen. The First English Governor was Sir Robert Townsend Farquhar. Under the rule of Sir Robert, two botanists, Boyer and Helsenberg, explored Madagascar and the African coasts in search of rare plants for the gardens. = British rule = Under the British rule, many modifications were brought to the Ch√¢teau. It needed extensive repairs after damage caused to it by cyclones in 1868 and 1892. The Ch√¢teau was saved from complete destruction during the cyclone in 1892 by the efforts of Governor Sir Henry Jerningham and his assistants. Sir Hesketh Bell was known to have taken an interest in the gardens of Le R√©duit. He created an islet in the middle of the lake, linked by a bridge. He also installed a fountain on the north side of the Ch√¢teau. He also introduced many plants from Kew Gardens, London, and other plants from Ceylon. In 1921, he constructed a memorial named \\"Le Temple de l'Amour\\" in Pierre F√©lix Barthelemy David's memory. This is situated near the ornamental lake at the end of the garden called \\"Bout du Monde\\" ‚Äì from where one can see below the confluence of the rivers Profonde and Cascade. There is a marble inscription on the floor of the memorial which reads: \\"TO M. BARTHELEMY DAVID / Gouverneur de l'Isle de France 1746 / the creator of Le R√©duit / his Grateful Successors\\" = Independence = On 12 March 1968 Mauritius achieved independence and Sir John Shaw Rennie became the first Governor-General. In September 1968, Sir Arthur Leonard Williams succeeded Sir John. Sir Arthur died on 27 December 1972 and was buried in the cemetery of St. John, situated in the proximity of the Ch√¢teau. In 1972 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II appointed Sir Raman Osman as the first Mauritian Governor- General. Sir Raman retired on 31 October 1977. Since this date, the office of Governor-General was held in an acting capacity by Sir Henry Garrioch, Sir Dayendranath Burrenchobay, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, and Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo in January 1986.

Namibia is a known source for gem quality diamonds and is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa. In terms of scale, impact and economic importance, diamond mining is the most prominent industrial activity in Namibia.  NDTC joint venture  The NDTC agreement and joint venture was reached in January 2007. According to the NDTC, the partnership was developed to promote diamond sorting, valuing, selling and marketing practices in Namibia through the exclusive use of domestically mined stones. It is estimated that 300 million in diamonds will be exported from Namibia in the calendar year 2009.  NDTC environmental controversy  The origins of the NDTC joint venture were initiated in 1994 with a mineral right agreement between De Beers and the government of the Republic of Namibia, resulting in (Namibia-De Beers). In 2007, the NDTC was formalised with the two principles agreeing to sustainable natural resource mining through Environmental Management Plans, which have been instituted at all NamDeb mining operations within Namibia. However, mining operations prior to the formalised agreement resulted in extensive environmental damage, including the removal of tidal habitat, destruction of flora and fauna through additional roads and towns, disposal of sediments in the ocean and its effects on marine life, proliferation of waste mounds, accumulation of waste in the form of machinery and buildings and the scarring of the desert through transport. To date, no funds have been set aside by NamDeb or the NDTC to retroactively repair or restore natural habitat damaged by diamond mining operations.  NDTC siteholders  The NDTC, as with all DTC branches, allows companies known as siteholders to exclusively purchase supplies of domestically mined rough diamonds. The current siteholder contracts end in 2011, after which the siteholders will be re-evaluated by De Beers. Currently, there are ten wholesale and one retail NDTC siteholders, including: Retail: Almod Diamonds Ltd.

The novel explores the events which Will, Chester and his friends have to go through to attempt to prevent the Styx from continuing their next phase of destruction upon Topsoil. Plot summary Part 1: Breaking Cover The story opens with Sarah Jerome, Will's biological mother, dismounting from a bus and going on foot to a concealed chamber built into a bridge in a remote rural location. There she collects a letter that states her brother Tam is dead because he was found helping Will and his biological brother escape but he makes a last stand allowing Will and his brother to escape with his friend to meet up with Chester. Meanwhile, Will and Chester are overjoyed to be reunited once again as the Miners' Train travels down through the Earth on its way to the Deeps. Will's younger brother, Cal, is also with them. The train passes through a series of storm gates (gates designed to block powerful winds from inside the earth) and, on the final approach to the Miners' Station, the three boys jump from it. Having escaped detection at the station, they travel further into the Deeps, where they are attacked by carnivorous bats and are forced to take shelter in an old, deserted house. Inside the house they find evidence that Will's stepfather, Dr. Burrows, has already been there. Sarah adopts a disguise, allowing her to become a woman who has the authority to interview a deranged Mrs. Burrows, who currently is residing at Humphrey House. However, when her fear that Will actually killed Tam clouds her judgment, Mrs. Burrows quickly realizes the fake, forcing Sarah to flee. Soon, she is acquainted with a much skinnier, much weaker Bartleby, who takes her to a hiding place. There, a few days later, Rebecca and the Styx show up and make her believe for sure that Will killed Tam. Rebecca tells her that she knows where Will is, and that he is forcing Cal to come with him, and, if she doesn't act soon, Will might also kill him. Finally, they explain that Cal and Bartleby shared a strong bond, and, because of his love for Cal, Bartleby would be able to track him down anywhere... Finally, Dr. Burrows is shown to be still alive. He has been accepted by a strange, gentle group of people called Coprolites. Sadly for them, a special detachment of the Styx called Limiters has been killing them. Having been left provisions by the Coprolites before they moved camp to a safer location, Dr. Burrows packs up and leaves, continuing further into the Deeps, keeping his notebook with him at all times. Part 2: The Homecoming Sarah is taken to see her mother, Grandma Macaulay, in her old home. Grandma Macaulay has been persuaded by the Styx that Will was responsible for Tam's demise, and she is full of vengeance and asks Sarah to exact revenge on the boy. Sarah is then escorted to the Styx Garrison where she rests, is given military training, and is also subjected to sermons from The Book of Catastrophes. Concerned that their food supplies are running low, Will and Chester follow Cal down into an opening of the floor of the Great Plain, where Cal enters a cavern filled with unidentified pipe-like organisms. As he stumbles, Cal touches one of these organisms, then collapses. Will and Chester discover that the boy isn't breathing, but they are forced to flee the cavern in order to save their own lives. Topsoil, it is dawn in England, and Rebecca and a squad of Styx are on the rooftop of Admiralty Arch, overlooking Trafalgar Square, with baskets of doves. Attached to the leg of each bird is a small metal ball which, when melted by the sun, will release a small amount of a non-deadly form of the virus that the Styx have been working on. The section ends with Rebecca cheering the doves on to \\"Fly, fly, fly!\\". Part 3: Drake and Elliott After his brother's death, Will is beside himself with grief, and Chester becomes increasingly concerned about the strange way he is acting. Shortly thereafter, they witness the execution of a group of Coprolites by a patrol of Styx Limiters. Will's abnormal behavior takes over again, and he asks for a piece of chewing gum. Before he unwraps it, knives are put at both boys' throats. A man speaks, telling them to bury the gum, and then to come with them. With no alternative but to do what they are told, Will and Chester comply with these demands. The two strangers introduce themselves as renegades, namely Drake and Elliott. Drake soon realizes it is important to keep Will alive because he thinks Will may be the cause of the increased Styx presence in the Deeps, and also because he discovers Will is Sarah Jerome's son. For the most part, Elliott maintains a hostile attitude towards the boys, except for Chester. Cal, who Will and Chester feared had perished in a \\"sugar trap\\", is resuscitated by Drake. Sarah persuades Joseph to allow her to leave the Styx Garrison so she can revisit the Rookeries, a place where the most deprived Colonists are left to rot, and where she and her brother Tam played as children. However, as she passes through the area, she is recognized and hailed as a hero. As she emerges from the Rookeries, she is met by Rebecca who tells her they are to leave for the Deeps on the Miners' Train. Topsoil, the virus created by the Styx scientists has been spread, and is wreaking havoc on England. The symptoms are some coughing, and swollen eyes, which make reading and looking at objects very hard. A grouchy Mrs. Burrows is visited by a man who has a distinguished voice and likes boiled eggs, hence Mrs. Burrows's nickname for him: \\"boiled-egg man\\". Boiled-egg Man tells her everything will be fine, when, in fact, it is steadily getting worse. Soon, a woman named Mrs. L dies, and not long after that, the laboratory that researches the virus is burned, and, when Boiled-egg Man appears on the news, claiming that there was no case of arson and that it was an experiment that blew the lab up, killing five scientists. Mrs. Burrows, who believes the opposite, becomes very angry. Part 4: The Island When they are attacked by Limiters, Will becomes separated from Drake, Elliott, Cal and Chester, and without any food or light, becomes completely lost in the lava tubes for several days. He eventually emerges from the lava tubes, and is reunited with Chester. Meanwhile, Drake and Elliott take Cal with them as they search the Great Plain for Will, and here they come to a place called the Bunker, which it appears was once used to breed Coprolites. One area in the Bunker is now being used to test the Dominion virus, which the Styx intend to use to decimate a large proportion of the Topsoil population. After a Styx ambush, Drake is captured outside the Bunker, while Elliott and Cal manage to escape. The two return to Will and Chester, and then Elliott leads them all to an island in a subterranean sea. Elliott takes Will to scout, and they discover that Drake is being tortured. Elliott decides to kill him to put him out of his misery. When they return to the camp, Elliott captures a \\"night crab\\" for a meal, which Will identifies as a relic species of Anomalocaris. Part 5: The Pore Dr. Burrows comes across a temple-like structure, built by a civilization that worships a sun. He discovers a hoard of large dust mites and then comes across a huge, mile-long hole, which he accidentally falls into. Elliott's initial plan is to take the boys to a place called the Wetlands, where they will allegedly be safe. She takes them through a tunnel, but before long, Bartleby appears, and Cal is delighted. Elliott shoots an advancing stranger, which turns out to be Sarah Jerome. Will and Cal assures her that he did not kill Tam, then he and the others continue on their way. At her insistence, because she is too badly injured and would only slow them down, Sarah stays behind. Drake is revealed to have survived the bunker attack, and that the man Will shot was a different man. He sees Sarah and lures a Styx patrol away, rescuing her. He takes her to the Pore, where they witness the events that follow. They eventually come across the huge hole; the same one Dr. Burrows fell into. It is identified as the Pore, which stretches even deeper into the Earth's surface. Before long, they are ambushed by Rebecca, and she reveals that there is not one but two of her; they are twins, and they have been alternatively living in Will's home, posing as his younger sister. They reveal their plot to kill all Topsoilers with a deadly virus called Dominion, which was extracted from the Eternal City by the Styx Division. The twins order the Limiters to open fire; Cal is killed as a result. Will, Elliott, Chester, and Bartleby are blown into the Pore by the Styx's heavy guns. The Rebecca twins presume that they have fallen to their death, and the Limiters cease fire. Sarah, who is close to death from her gunshot wounds, witnesses this. She draws upon her last remaining strength and, in a headlong rush at the Rebecca twins, takes them over the edge of the Pore with her. Several days later, Drake is shown Topsoil as he observes a Colonist who is, in turn, observing Mrs. Burrows. It is clear that he wants to exact his revenge on the Styx for the deaths of Sarah and Cal. The book ends when he dials a phone and waits for an answer. Reception Following its release in the US on 3 February 2009, the book very quickly appeared on The New York Times Children's Chapter Books Best Seller List on 22 February 2009. It received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Metacritic called \\"it a great book filled with suspense at every page\\". Meagan Albright's review stated, \\"It is a rare book that can create an entirely new fantastic, harsh, creative yet believable world for readers to visit.

Mufti Muhammad is the younger brother of Mufti Aslam Bandyalwi, also of Bradford, who is the principal of another notable Dar ul Uloom in Bradford, Jamia Islamia Rizvia. Mufti Muhammad Fazal took on the role of head imam and head of the Alim course in 2005 and has since taught the traditional sciences to students studying at a higher level and training to become Imams in the UK. Mufti Muhammad has a strong reputation amongst scholars as being a very impressive and competent muddaris (teacher) and is particularly recognised for his great grasp of and ability to teach traditional Arabic grammar (Sarf and Nahw) and Hanafi Fiqh. In 2009, the first six students graduated from the Centre as imams. These include Moulana Wajid Iqbal, Moulana Qari Imran Rizvi, Moulana Hafiz Abdul Samee, Moulana Hafiz Abdul Saeed, and Moulana Abdul Hafeez Aziz. These imams have been a great success story not only for the centre but for the wider Sunni community. Having studied in the UK, they are now themselves teaching the Alim course to other students both at Al-Mustafa and other institutions. Moulana Hafiz Abdul Samee has gone on to become the Head Imam of Central Madni Mosque in Halifax. The others also have posts as imams and teachers at other institutions in Bradford, including Jamia Tabligh Ul Islam Victor Street, Jamia Muhammadiya, Jamia Tabligh Ul Islam Toller Lane, and Jamia Islamia Rizvia.  Shadhili Tariqa  The centre is home to many murids (students) of Shaykh Muhammad al- Ya‚Äôqoubi, the esteemed and world recognised religious scholar from Syria. The students have weekly gatherings of Dhikr at the centre as well as other classes and events.

Smolin, who serves as its director. The Center focuses its research and conferences on the ethical and legal implications of biotechnology and biotechnology law, rather than pursuing a general emphasis on the subject of bioethics or bioethics law like many other academic research centers. Its location within Birmingham places it in an emerging center for biotechnology research and commerce. Of primary importance for the Center, however, is generating law review articles on emerging biotechnology issues, which is often done as part of a conference speakers' presentation. Methodology and purpose Research focuses on understanding current bioethical issues related to biotechnology and biotechnology law, as well as how different ideologies answer, or if they even can answer, different bioethical issues. The Center's approach to bioethical research attempts to understand \\"multiple perspectives\\" and evaluate the validity of each.Cumberland Programs The Center has sponsored five conferences that have dealt with the United States health care system, research on children, biofuels, genetically modified foods, and whether the field of bioethics and its methodology can provide actual answers to ethical questions or merely the opinions of ethicists. Annual symposium 2010 Conference - The Missing Girls of China and India: What Can Be Done? The center hosts an annual Symposium at which experts give presentations on bioethical issues. The papers are published in the Cumberland Law Review. The symposia attempt to offer a broad range of views and seek factual, persuasive solutions to problems, rather than to generate opinionated debates. Speakers have included United States Congressman Artur Davis, atmospheric scientist John Christy, medical ethics expert Gregory Pence, Vermont Law School's environmental center director Michael Dworkin, John Nyman, Larry Palmer, and law professors, entrepreneurs and other experts. Speakers often publish a paper in the Cumberland Law Review that develops the theme of their presentation.

Similarly, about five percent of female are \\"missing\\" from India's population. Collectively, this indicates a loss of tens of millions of Chinese and Indian females which creates significant socioeconomic complications. The sex-ratio imbalances in China and India have grown worse despite successful economic development and pressures toward cultural modernization. Scholarship on \\"the missing girls\\" of China and India has been increasingly successful in documenting and identifying some of the most direct causes.

Concerns over diminishing supplies, growing demand, price instabilities, environmental impacts, international competition for limited resources, energy security, and the costs of foreign involvement necessitated by our ‚Äúaddiction to oil‚Äù have created an imperative toward renewable energy. Yet, some view the United States‚Äô first major venture into renewable fuels, corn-based ethanol, as a failure that has contributed to higher food prices and brings little overall environmental or supply gain. Political and popular rhetoric suggests that a technological fix, in forms such as second-generation biofuels, fuel cells, electric cars, or a hydrogen economy are just around the corner, and yet most estimates posit that petroleum based fuels will predominate for at least several more decades. President Barack Obama has promised a new and different energy policy. This conference, taking place a little more than month into the new administration, will look at the possibilities for transportation energy policy both for the United States and other nations. Upon examination, government has a limited set of tools it can use to promote a transition to renewable energy and promote energy conservation/efficiency. Options include subsidies or tax credits for renewable energy, taxing carbon-based energy, funding research, promoting/funding/designing for mass transit, renewable fuel standards, CAF√â-fuel efficiency standards, and mandating that energy efficient/alternative energy cars be built in exchange for financial help for the car industry. These issues of supply, demand, price, security, nationalism, and environment occur within an interdependent world. Hence, this conference will look beyond the United States to transportation energy policy throughout the world.\\" Transportation Energy Policy, Conference Brochure, 2009 # Energy Futures - Professor Lakshman Guruswamy, University of Colorado Law School # United States Energy Policy - Professor Joshua Fershee, University of North Dakota School of Law # India‚Äôs Energy Future Professor Deepa Badrinarayana, Chapman University School of Law # Human Rights, Human Development, and Energy - Professor David Smolin, Cumberland School of Law, Samford University (focusing on the need to pursue low cost energy primarily because it is a human rights issue) # Point/Counterpoint - Professor David Smolin (Cumberland/Samford) will moderate a discussion among all conference participants, inviting discussion by both conference participants and audience, on the hard questions and difficult choices facing both the United States and other nations in regard to transportation energy policy. =The Baby Market, 2008= The speakers for this event were:Faith and Politics - The Baby Market #Michele Goodwin - visiting professor at University of Chicago Law School, chair-elect of the Association of American Law Schools section on law and medicine, and a fellow of the Institute of Medicine of Chicago.http://www.law.umn.edu/facultyprofiles/goodwinm.html #Judith Daar - California law professor and clinical professor of medicine , \\"Progress and Pitfalls in Emerging Reproductive Technologies\\"; #Gregory Pence - University of Alabama at Birmingham philosophy professor and medical ethics specialist, \\"The Case for Non-Regulation\\"; #David M.

During World War II, he commanded the Haidari concentration camp, near Athens, Greece, and the Syrets concentration camp in the occupied Ukraine. SS career Radomski was an \\"Old Fighter\\" of the Nazi Party, and one of the early companions of the eventual RSHA chief Reinhard Heydrich. Radomski served six months in prison in 1932 for political killing. He was considered brutal, even by his fellow SS officers. The SS judge, Sturmbannf√ºhrer Wehser called him a drunkard \\"primitive in all his thoughts\\".Hagen Fleischer, Im Kreuzschatten der M√§chte, Griechenland 1941‚Äì1944. Frankfurt am Main 1986, p. 548. =Syrets concentration camp= Radomski was the commander of the Syrets concentration camp in Kiev. It was situated at the north-western edge of the city, in the place called Syrets, today a suburb of the city. The Syrets concentration camp was created in spring of 1942. Radomski was relieved of his post in 24 February 1943, after he threatened to shoot his own adjutant while drunk, and was replaced by Lieutenant Karl Fischer. As commander of the Syrets concentration camp he led a terror regime, ordering severe punishments for the smallest infractions, a habit he carried over to his new posting in Greece. =Haidari concentration camp= On November 28, 1943, Radomski was appointed commandant of Haidari concentration camp, near Athens, Greece. The previous German commandant, Sergeant Rudi Trepte, and his two Greek interpreters had been arrested by the Gestapo, for reasons as yet unknown. Under Radomski, the camp inmates were put to labour in two four-hour shifts each day except Sundays. The inmates were divided into groups of 100 men, with a hecatontarch in charge of each. However, the labour was not intended for any productive purposes, but merely to break the prisoners' morale: they were made to dig holes and then refill them, build walls and then break them down. Haidari Municipality: Haidari as an SS camp - Major Paul von Radomski The first execution in the camp was carried out on 7 December, when Radomski personally executed a Greek Jewish reservist lieutenant of the Greek army, the Israeli Levi of Ioannina, in front of the prisoners because he \\"attempted to escape during his arrest\\". This execution was to serve not only as a warning to the others, but, according to post-war psychological research, to \\"put the inmates in constant fear of their lives\\". Haidari Municipality: The first execution at Haidari In total, in the camp's one year of operations, about 1,800 people were executed, while another 300 died as a result of torture either at Haidari or in the Gestapo headquarters at Merlin street in central Athens. These numbers included 30 women, 104 invalids, and 230 students. After the war track of Radomski was lost until 2005, when the Hamburg prosecutor announced that the Ukrainian authorities, investigating crimes in the concentration camp Syrets, had reported that Radomski had died on 14 March 1945 in the vicinity of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in Hungary.Wolodymyr Prystajko: Tschi buw ‚Äûmattsch smerti‚Äú?

The Tuvan People's Republic issued postage stamps between 1926 and 1936. They were popular with stamp collectors in the Western world in the mid-twentieth century because of the obscurity and exoticism of Tannu Tuva and the stamps' quirky, colorful designs. The validity of many stamps purportedly issued by Tannu Tuva has been questioned by philatelists. Background Tuva was a country in central Asia between Russia and Mongolia, which in 1921, under Soviet instigation, became the Tuvan People's Republic. A treaty between the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic in 1926 affirmed the country‚Äôs independence, although no other countries formally recognized it. In 1944, it was annexed to the Soviet Union as part of the Tuvan Autonomous Oblast and in 1961 became the Tuva Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Its successor since 1992, the Tuvan Republic, is a member of the Russian Federation. Postage stamps Tuva stamp (stag) 1927. The first Tuvan stamps were issued in 1926.Scott Postage Stamp Catalogue, Tannu Tuva, nos. 1-38. The first series depicted the Buddhist wheel of life with Mongolian writing and numerals only. Beginning in 1927, Tannu Tuva issued a series of color stamps with local scenes or a map of the country. These stamps were issued in several shapes, including rectangles, triangles and diamonds, and bore text in Mongolian and the words \\"TOUVA\\" and \\"postage\\". From 1934 to 1936, Tuva issued about 100 different postage stamps with exotic images of Tuvan life, including horse racing, nomadic battle scenes, and domestic animals including camels and oxen. These large format stamps came in a variety of shapes including diamonds, and were widely sold to collectors in canceled-to-order form. According to one source, these stamps were the brainchild of Bela Sekula, a promoter of philatelic \\"rarities\\", who in 1934 convinced the Tuvan and Soviet authorities to manufacture exotic stamps to sell to collectors.The World at War, Tannu Tuva 1911-1944 They were in fact \\"designed in Moscow, printed in Moscow, franked in Moscow and sold abroad by a Moscow state trading firm to earn hard currency for Moscow.\\"Friends of Tuva, \\"Tuva Hopes Philately Will Get It Everywhere\\"Stanley Phillips, Philatelic Magazine Vol. 39, p. 197 (Mar. 5, 1937) Nor were all the images on the stamps accurate representations of Tuvan life. One of the stamps, for example, depicted a camel racing a locomotive along Tuva's non- existent railway. In fact, there is still no railway in Tuva. Another stamp showed a large airship with a man on horseback below, reflecting Soviet enthusiasm for airships between the World Wars. There is no evidence that an airship visited Tuva at that time.\\"The Tuvan 'Zeps': Fact or Fantasy?\\" by Gwyn Williams in Gibbons Stamp Monthly, Vol. 44, No. 3, August 2013, pp. 64-68. Tuva \\"stamp\\" (camel \\"racing\\" locomotive) 1936. The standing of the Tannu Tuva stamps has been controversial with some catalogues formerly not listing Tuvan stamps, however, all the major catalogues now include the stamps while noting the existence of many canceled-to-order stamps. Philatelists contend that early Tuvan stamps did see limited postal use\\"Philately's Ugliest Ducklings: Rehabilitating the 1934-36 Issues of Tannu Tuva\\" by James Negus at TTCS. Originally published in The Philatelic Journal, July-September 1960. and covers do exist. Philatelic literature such as The Postal History and Stamps of Tuva by S.M. Blekhman also confirms non-philatelic commercial use of the stamps. Notwithstanding their questionable origins, these exotic stamps were popular with young collectors during the middle of the twentieth century. This is documented, for example, in Tuva or Bust!, Richard Feynman's Last Journey by Ralph Leighton (W.W. Norton & Co., 1991), where childhood memories of the colorful stamps of Tannu Tuva inspired Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman and the author on a quest, first to contact someone in Tuva, and then to actually visit the country. Feynman died before achieving his goal, but Leighton ultimately reached Tuva.O'Brien, Miles. \\"Popularity of late physicist revived on Internet\\", CNN, October 10, 1996. Accessed January 29, 2009. Leighton and Feynman's efforts rekindled an interest in Tuva and its stamps, which now are the subject of numerous websites. Illegal stamps Since the 1990s, numerous labels purporting to be postage stamps of Tuva have appeared on the market. They have depicted a variety of unlikely Tuvan subjects, such as Bart Simpson, the Teletubbies and Led Zeppelin, and are all illegal stamps apparently intended to deceive collectors.\\"The Recent Stamps of Tuva\\" by Les Winick at TTCS. Originally published in The Philatelic Exporter, February 1999. Revenue stamps A 1926 Tuvan revenue stamp. While the status of many Tuvan postage stamps is disputed, a number of revenue stamps were issued for Tuva in 1926, whose status is not in doubt.

Edmonds. The story follows the lives of fictional Gil and Lana Martin, settlers in the central Mohawk Valley of the New York frontier during the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783). Frank Bergmann wrote in 2005 that the novel, \\"as a best-seller and a novel perennially assigned in the state's high schools, has substantially shaped the popular view of the region's pioneer period.\\" The book is peopled with historical persons such as General Nicholas Herkimer, Adam Helmer, descendants of the German immigrants who were the majority residents in the central Mohawk Valley at the time, and William Caldwell. It also features such historical events as the Battle of Oriskany and the Attack on German Flatts (1778). The novel was a commercial and popular success, remaining on the bestseller list for two years. Bergmann's foreword for the 60th anniversary printing of Edmonds' novel. In 1939, the book was adapted for a Technicolor feature film of the same name directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda, Claudette Colbert, Edna May Oliver, Ward Bond, and John Carradine. Historian Edward Countryman has argued that, while the film incorporates characters, plot, and dialogue from the novel, it differs profoundly in its portrayal of society in the period of the American Revolution. He (Ford) made it a mythic triumph of the American cause, rather than suggesting the complexity of the times as had Edmonds. Similarly, Frank Bergmann has written, \\"Unfortunately the 1939 film directed by John Ford, starring Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert, abandons the historical complexity of the original for the mythic simplification of an all-American Western.\\" The Bantam Books edition had gone through no less than 48 printings between July 1936 and August 1956. The novel is still in print after eight decades. Reprint of 1936 novel.

PCA was founded in 1977 and initially run by Hugh Parnell, father of Stewart Parnell, with him and two other sons. The company was sold in 1994‚Äì1995 with the senior Parnell retiring, and with Stewart Parnell and others remaining with the new company as consultants. In 2000, control of PCA returned to Stewart Parnell via a private sale. Over this history, PCA came to operate processing facilities in Blakely, Georgia, Suffolk, Virginia, and Plainview, Texas, providing peanut and peanut butter products primarily to the \\"institutional food\\" market (schools, prisons and nursing homes), to food manufacturers for use in cookies, snacks, ice cream, and dog treats, and to other low-end markets. PCA permanently halted its operations after it was found to be the source of a massive Salmonella outbreak in the U.S., during late 2008 and early 2009. By 2007, prior to closing its doors, PCA had grown to 90 employees and was doing $25 million in annual sales. It has been estimated to have been manufacturing roughly 2.5% of processed peanuts in the U.S. at that time. The 2008 contamination followed a long history of food quality issues. There had been concerns about sanitation at the company by private individuals since at least the mid-1980s, when the company was run by its founder, Stewart Parnell's father, Hugh Parnell. In addition, in the years just prior to its sale and Hugh Parnell's retirement, PCA was sued: by American Candy Company in 1990, and by Zachary Confections Inc. of Frankfort, Indiana in 1991, after discovery that PCA's peanut products exceeded the FDA tolerance level for aflatoxin, a mold-derived toxin common to peanuts. Moreover, as a result of the coming contamination event, investigations would show that some PCA processing was being done without FDA knowledge and oversight, and other food handling and processing areas had gone long periods without federal inspection. In late 2008 and early 2009, as a result of the Salmonella contamination event, 9 people died and at least 714 people (half of them children) fell ill, all from food poisoning after eating products containing contaminated peanuts. This contamination triggered the most extensive food recall in U.S. history up to that time, involving 46 states, more than 360 companies, and more than 3,900 different products manufactured using PCA ingredients. The contamination and recall had immediate major ramifications for the market of this set of farm products, and further impact on public perceptions of food safety and on government regulation of the same. On February 13, 2009, Peanut Corporation of America ceased all manufacturing and business operations, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation. As of February 2009, a federal criminal investigation was continuing, and at least a dozen civil lawsuits had been filed. In September 2015, Stewart Parnell was sentenced, after earlier conviction on more than 70 criminal charges‚Äîincluding felony charges that included knowingly shipping tainted food across state lines‚Äîto 28 years in prison for his role in the nationwide outbreak. Scope of business Hugh Parnell Sr. founded Parnell's Peanuts, in Gorman, Texas in 1977 selling to consumers, bakeries and manufacturers (candy, ice cream, and snacks). In 1990 the FDA found PCA distributing peanuts with unacceptable levels of aflatoxins, caused by mold that grows in nuts and seeds. In 1992 American Candy Company sued PCA for lost inventory that used PCA nuts with aflatoxins. The company was sold in 1994‚Äì1995, with the senior Parnell retiring, and with Stewart Parnell and others remaining with the new company as consultants. In 2000, control of PCA returned to Stewart Parnell via a private sale. Over this history, PCA came to operate processing facilities in Blakely, Georgia, Suffolk, Virginia, and Plainview, Texas, providing peanuts, peanut butter, peanut meal, and peanut paste to an institutional food market‚Äîto schools, prisons, and nursing homes‚Äîas well as to low-budget retail outlets such as dollar stores and to food manufacturers for use in cookies, snacks, ice cream, and dog treats. It has been estimated to have been manufacturing roughly 2.5 percent of processed peanuts in the U.S. at its height, with 90 employees and $25 million in annual sales in 2007. The company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and permanently halted its processing and sales operations, after being found to be the source of a massive Salmonella outbreak in the United States beginning in 2008. Aflatoxin suits PCA was sued in 1990 by American Candy Company after the FDA discovered that PCA's peanut butter exceeded the FDA tolerance level for aflatoxin, a mold-derived toxin common to peanut production; American Candy had turned the peanut butter into 8,000 unshipped cases of \\"kisses\\" for Wal-Mart. Another lawsuit was brought by Zachary Confections Inc. of Frankfort, Indiana, in 1991, after a 40,020-pound shipment of nuts from PCA was also found to have an unacceptably high level of aflatoxin. Nestl√© inspection In January 2006, Nestl√© completed an onsite audit of PCA's Plainview plant, and gave it a \\"Does Not Meet Standards\\" score on nearly all 40 inspection areas. Months after, PCA hired Kenneth Kendrick as assistant plant manager at the Plainview plant. FDA oversight before 2008 In 2001, FDA inspectors also found that products from the Blakely plant were potentially exposed to insecticides, according to a report obtained by the Associated Press.Insecticide found in peanut plant during 2001 tour, Associated Press, February 6, 2009 According to Virginia state inspection records, the PCA blanching operations in Suffolk, Virginia, had some of the same food safety problems that would be found in the company's Georgia plant (see below). Inspection in 2008 found mold on \\"totes\\" holding peanuts, counted 43 mouse droppings on the floor, and saw a live bird walking and flying inside the warehouse.Reports show safety problems at Suffolk peanut processor, News & Advance, February 11, 2009Peanut blanching plant in Virginia had Salmonella risks, CNN, February 9, 2009  Salmonella contamination of products=Discovery and impact= In late 2008 and early 2009, nine people died and at least 714 people in 46 states, half of them children, fell ill due to food poisoning from eating products containing contaminated peanuts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among persons with available information, 23% reported being hospitalized. The real numbers were believed to be much higher, since for every reported case of salmonellosis, on average, another 38 or so cases go unreported, according to the CDC.First Florida Salmonella poisoning linked to peanut plant reported, The News-Press, February 5, 2009 A combination of epidemiological analysis and laboratory testing by state officials in Minnesota and Connecticut, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the CDC enabled the FDA to confirm that the sources of the outbreak of illnesses caused by Salmonella typhimurium were peanut butter, peanut paste, and peanut meal produced by the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) at its Blakely, Georgia, processing plant.

Inspectors found that the company also did not clean its equipment after finding contamination, and did not properly segregate raw and finished products.Salmonella Was Found at Peanut Plant Before, New York Times, January 28, 2009FDA report finds multiple problems at peanut plant, Associated Press, January 28, 2009 In 2007, the company shipped chopped peanuts on two occasions even after Salmonella was confirmed by private lab tests.Products shipped even when they failed, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 7, 2009 The company had previously refused to divulge production test records until federal officials invoked the food safety provisions of a federal antiterrorism law (the 2002 Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act).Lawmakers: Food safety fixes need push from Obama, Associated Press, February 6, 2009 As a result of this refusal and the incident in general, the Georgia State Senate passed a bill requiring peanut product manufacturers to report any contamination within 24 hours, failing which felony charges would result.Georgia Lawmakers Take First Step in Toughening Law, WRCB-TV, February 19, 2009 On February 6, 2009, the FDA reported that the company shipped tainted products under three conditions: (1) without retesting, (2) before the retest results came back from an outside company, and (3) after a second test showed no bacterial contamination.FDA: Peanut plant knew product was tainted with Salmonella, CNN, February 6, 2009 In all three cases, the initial positive result means that the product should have been destroyed. Food safety experts say Salmonella can live in pockets of peanut butter, so that one batch could test both negative and positive. In that case, it should have been destroyed, they said.Obama Faults FDA on Food Safety, Washington Post, February 3, 2009 Documents released February 11 by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee showed that the company shipped products to customers even before receiving results of Salmonella tests, and the company stopped using a private laboratory because too many tests done there showed contamination.Peanut Corp. Ignored Salmonella Findings, Labs Say, Bloomberg, February 11, 2009 A lab tester told the House panel that the company discovered Salmonella at its Blakely plant as far back as 2006. =Texas= The company had operated a plant in Gorman, where the company originally started in 1977. David Brooks, the snack food company buyer interviewed by the Washington Post after the Salmonella outbreak, said that he inspected this plant three times on behalf of his company in the mid-1980s to determine whether to buy peanuts from PCA. The plant failed his private inspection each time for what he called \\"just filthy\\" conditions, including dusty beams, leaky roofs, and birds flying through the building. The Gorman operations transferred to Plainview when Hale County officials issued $2 million in tax- free revenue bonds to help the company convert a long vacant Jimmy Dean sausage factory into a peanut plant. Local officials, including a county health inspector, toured the new plant and approved its opening, although the state said it never knew the plant existed. The plant was located along a major highway, across from a large Wal-Mart distribution center; it had four highly visible signs in the front and a billboard bearing a picture of a peanut. A state inspector who drove by the plant \\"a few times\\" on his way to other inspections never stopped because it was not on his list. State officials said the company was solely to blame for failing to obtain the food manufacturer's license when the Plainview plant opened. The company's plant in Plainview opened in March 2005 and employed 30 people, but was never licensed in that state as a food manufacturing facility; the state had not done any inspections until the problems with the Georgia plant became news. The Texas plant blanched, dry- and oil-roasted, and chopped peanuts, then shipped them to food companies across the country. The plant had been certified for organic production in November 2005, based on what state officials later called incomplete information obtained by an inspector with the Texas Department of Agriculture.Peanut Corporation of America to Liquidate, New York Times, February 14, 2009 However, the company failed to apply for a Texas health certificate, which would have triggered a visit by state inspectors.All peanuts from Texas plant are recalled, Houston Chronicle, February 12, 2009 State health officials were not aware the plant existed until the company released a list of its plants around the country.Texas issues emergency recall of Plainview peanut plant's products, Dallas Morning News, February 13, 2009 The Texas inspection in January 2009 found some unsanitary conditions, such as unclean sections of a peanut-roasting line.

GDA and GBI officials had said they would consider pursuing manslaughter charges if federal authorities did not take up the case.

Vernon Keenan, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, said: \\"Any potential prosecution is most appropriately handled at the federal level\\". =Federal Prosecution= On February 9, 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it had joined with the FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) as part of a criminal investigation of the company.FBI joins investigation of peanut- related illnesses, CNN, February 9, 2009 Search warrants were executed on the Blakely plant, as well as PCA's corporate headquarters in Lynchburg.FBI Issues Search Warrants In Peanut Case, WXIA-TV, February 9, 2009 Following a raid by its agents, the Federal Agents sealed off the Blakely plant.FBI Seals Off Blakely, GA Peanut Plant, WJBF-TV, February 10, 2009 On February 21, 2013, four former officials of the company were named in a 75-count indictment on charges related to Salmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut products. The former processing plant manager for Peanut Corporation, Samuel Lightsey, reached a plea agreement on May 8, 2014. Lightsey was then available to the government as a witness at the trial, scheduled to begin in July 2014.Former plant manager reaches plea agreement =Convictions= Parnell and his brother were convicted in September 2014 of 71 criminal counts, including conspiracy, fraud and other federal charges. In July 2015, Federal authorities recommended a sentence of life imprisonment for Stewart Parnell. Both Daniel Kilgore and Samuel Lightsey (both former plant managers at PCA) pleaded guilty on their related charges and became government witnesses in the case, providing testimony during the 2014 trial, for consideration of limited sentencing. =Sentencings= In July 2015, federal authorities recommended a sentence of life imprisonment for Parnell. On September 21, 2015, Parnell was sentenced to 28 years in prison, the longest punishment ever handed out to a producer in a U.S. foodborne illness case. His brother Michael Parnell was sentenced to 20 years, and the plant's former quality assurance manager Mary Wilkerson was sentenced to five years. On October 1, 2015, the court sentenced Samuel Lightsey to three years in prison and Daniel Kilgore to six years in prison. (cooperating witnesses) U.S. District Judge W. Louis Sands stated during sentencing, \\"We place faith that no one would intentionally ship products to market that are contaminated‚Ä¶. Consumers are at the mercy of food producers for the safety of the products. These acts [of the convicted PCA executives] were driven by profit and the protection of profit ‚Ä¶ thus greed.\\" Sands told Stewart Parnell that he had \\"taken risks for years,\\" that they were \\"eventually discovered and traced back\\" to his corporation, and that, unfortunately, \\"thousands of people suffered and nine died\\" from Parnell's knowing disregard for public health and safety. Judge Sands addressed Mary Wilkerson, Quality Assurance Manager for PCA, \\"You were aware of what was going on and played a role in concealing the problem. That was not actually a minor role in this case\\". The PCA case, according to Sands, was not about the \\"condemnation of peanuts or the peanut industry, but of a few individuals.\\" The prosecution team asked the court to find that the Parnell brothers were flight risks and to deny them bail while they appeal their convictions. The prosecutors did not ask the same for Wilkerson. Judge Sands dismissed defense team allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and a \\"less-than-unbiased jury.\\" He also addressed defense objections to the victims' testimony, citing their constitutional rights.

Reconstructing his role in history is complicated by a variety of claims made in these texts. The chronology of Joiakim's tenure as priest has been the subject of dispute, as has the question of whether Joiakim was high priest. The Hebrew Bible, which mentions Joiakim only in the Book of Nehemiah, Chapter 12, does not call him \\"high priest,\\" though Josephus does use the term for him. The mystery surrounding the identity of Joiakim is rather convoluted. There are some conflicts between early sources on Joiakim. In addition, while the history of Josephus (Antiq. 11:121) mentions Joiakim (or \\"Joacim\\"), it does not include many details regarding his identity or role.  Hebrew Bible and Deuterocanonical Literature  In the Nehemiah , Joiakim is identified as the son of Joshua the High Priest. In verse 12 the expression \\"days of Jehoiakim\\" is used to denote a particular time period, and in verse 26 the \\"days of Jehoiakim\\" is equated with the days of Ezra and Nehemiah. Interpreters have disagreed as to whether this language implies that Joiakim was regarded as the high priest by the author of Nehemiah. However, \\"this list is artificial and problematic, but its existence reflects the importance of priests and Levites in this period.\\" (New Oxford Annotated Bible) (Identifies Joiakim as a High Priest, the son of Jeshua) In 1 Esdras 3:9; 5:5, Joiakim is referred to as the son of Zerubbabel. The Esdras genealogy of Zerubbabel's sons is considered to be highly confused.(Biblical Apocrypha) 1 Chronicles (Does not mention Joiakim as son of Zerubbabel, and there is no reference to Joiakim's role as a priest of the David line)The Bible Judith 4:6-7; 4:8; 4:14; 15:8 names a Joiakim as a High Priest who hold religious and military authority. It is unclear whether the Jehoiakim mentioned in Judith is intended to be the same individual referred to in Nehemiah 12. Because there is no evidence that a high priest would exercise such a wide range of powers, some scholars believe that the Joiakim of Judith may be a pseudonym for a person from either the Hasmonean dynasty period, the time of Trajan or Hadrian, or as a \\"representative figure of the priesthood in general.\\"Anchor Bible Dictionary The book of Susanna states that Joiakim was the husband of Susanna, a very rich man living in Babylon and the most honored Jew of them all.Susanna 1:1,4,6,28,29,63 However, according to the New Oxford Annotated Bible, it appears that this Joiakim is not connected to other Joaikims in the Bible (confirmed by Josephus). Josephus Joiakim may have aided in the rebuilding of the Second Temple, if he was a son of Joshua.(Ezra 3:9; Josephus Ant. 11:121) Joiakim is also labeled as a contemporary of Ezra(Josephus Ant. 11:121) Joiakim and Esdras may even have worked alongside on another, filling the Priestly role; Joiakim is called the \\"High Priest\\" while Ezra is referred to as the \\"Principal Priest of the People\\".(Ant. 11:121) Due to the prominent role of Ezra, as evidenced in Ant. 11:120-11:158, theories have been suggested that Ezra replaced Joiakim as High Priest. Josephus concluded the following, \\"And it was his [Ezra's] fate, after being honoured by the people, to die an old man to be buried with great magnificence in Jerusalem. About the same time also died the high priest Joakeimos, whom his son Eliashib succeeded in the high priesthood(Ant. 11.5,5) The combination of 1 Esdras and the way Josephus interpreted certain biblical passages, led him to believe Joiakim and Ezra were contemporaries. Josephus also took liberties to fill in the gaps between Ezra 6 and 7, \\"in which one jumps from the reign of Darius I (522-486 BCE) to that of Artaxerxes I (465-424 BCE), by relating the Ezra story to the days of the intervening monarch Xerxes. For this maneuver, he found support in Nehemiah 12, which seems to make Ezra the contemporary of the second high priest Joiakim who very likely served during Xerxes' reign.\\" NotesReferences 5th- century BC High Priests of Israel 5th-century BC clergy 5th- century BCE Jews Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah High Priests of Israel ","title":"Joiakim (High Priest)"},{"id":"21311919","text":"Grahovo ob Baƒçi (; Popaƒçeno Primorje. 1923.

BELLMEDICS originally helped soldiers who had lost limbs in The Persian Gulf War, with support from the United States Department of Defense. It then expanded operations and developed microlaser surgical tools for medical use. In 1998, Bell created Fleming-Monroe Aeronautics, which developed the PEARL Aerocontrol System. BELLMEDICS acquired Fleming-Monroe Aeronautics in 1999 and re-branded itself under the current name of Massive Dynamic. On the 10th anniversary of the company's founding, it expanded operations into computing and telecommunications, particularly in artificial intelligence, bio-computation and quantum cryptography. Massive Dynamic created Ludic Science in 2007, its entertainment subsidiary. Ludic Science developed Mass- Dyn Z10, a home video game console primarily for home entertainment use. Upon the death of Bell, the company ownership was fully bequeathed to Walter Bishop (played by John Noble). However, when the timeline was rewritten, Bishop did not gain ownership. FBI agent Charlie Francis (played by Kirk Acevedo) estimated the company to be worth around $50 billion USD. 7 World Trade Center, the headquarters of Massive Dynamic, was destroyed in 2036 by Bishop, using an anti-matter device to avoid capture by Loyalists, and the highrise sublimated where it stood.

Case Farms of Ohio, 96 F. Supp. 2d 578 (W.D. Tex. 1999), is a case involving poor working conditions for migratory workers. It established that a principal / agent relationship existed between Case Farms and America's Tempcorps (ATC) that allowed Case Farms to be liable for its agent's actions. Facts Migrant farm workers were recruited in Texas by America's Tempcorps to work in Case Farm's Ohio-based chicken processing plant. They were given a bus ticket and $20 for three days of food. Upon arriving they found themselves living in conditions called \\"distressing and deplorable\\" by the court. The employees were packed in to unfurnished rooms infested with cockroaches and rats. The workers slept on the floor and were transported in an overcrowded van. Issue The working conditions were largely not refuted. At issue was 1) whether or not American's Tempcorps (ATC) was an agent of Case Farms, and 2) if agency existed, whether that agency make Case Farms liable for ATC's actions. Complaint The plaintiffs alleged: *Violations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act (AWPA) *Violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act *Breach of Contract *Fraud *Negligent Misrepresentation Plaintiff‚Äôs Argument Castillo argued that agency relationship existed between ATC and Case Farms, and the scope of that relationship included both the express authority to recruit and hire people to work at Case Farms‚Äô plant, and the implied authority to do all things proper, usual and necessary to exercise that authority. Defendant‚Äôs Argument Case Farms argued, to the extent that an agency relationship existed, the scope of that agency was limited solely to informing recruits about the availability of work at Case Farms‚Äô processing plant. They also contended that the workers recruited by ATC were not full-fledged Case Farms workers (despite the fact that the work, pay rates, and supervision of these workers were essentially identical to Case Farms employees.)  The Court's Analysis  1) A principal may be liable for the acts of a purported agent based on an actual agency relationship created by the principal's express or implied delegation of authority to the agent. 2) A principal is liable only if those actions are taken in the scope of the agent's employment. Express actual authority exists ‚Äúwhere the principal has made it clear to the agent that he wants the act under scrutiny to be done.‚Äù 3) Giving an agent express authority to undertake a certain act also includes the implied authority to do all things proper, usual, and necessary to exercise that express authority. The evidence at trial supported the contention that Case Farms expressly authorized ATC to recruit and hire people to work at Case Farms‚Äô Ohio plant, and that such an express agency existed with the scope of recruiting and hiring migrant workers. The evidence also supported the contention that the housing and transportation activities were well within the agents implied authority‚Äîbased on Case Farms‚Äô unique recruiting challenges, the great distances the migrant workers sought were required to travel, and Case Farms outsourcing of this difficult recruiting task to ATC.  Holding  America's Tempcorps was an agent of Case Farms, ATC's actions were attributable to Case Farms for the purpose of assessing compliance with the AWPA, and Case Farms was liable for ATC's actions.

It is recognized in some national constitutions and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Definition  The right to housing is recognized in a number of international human rights instruments. Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises the right to housing as part of the right to an adequate standard of living. It states that: Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) also guarantees the right to housing as part of the right to an adequate standard of living. In international human rights law the right to housing is regarded as a freestanding right. This was clarified in the 1991 General Comment no 4 on Adequate Housing by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The general comment provides an authoritative interpretation of the right to housing in legal terms under international law. The Yogyakarta Principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity affirm that \\"everyone has the right to adequate housing, including protection from eviction, without discrimination and that States shall a) take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to ensure security of tenure and access to affordable, habitable, accessible, culturally appropriate and safe housing, not including shelters and other emergency accommodation, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or material or family status; b) take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to prohibit the execution of evictions that are not in conformity with their international human rights obligations, and ensure that adequate and effective legal or other appropriate remedies are available to any person claiming that a right to protection against forced evictions has been violated or is under threat of violation, including the right to resettlement, which includes the right to alternative land of better or equal quality and to adequate housing, without discrimination.\\"The Yogyakarta Principles, Principle 15. The Right to Adequate Housing The right to housing is also enshrined in Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 16 of the European Social Charter (Article 31 of the Revised European Social charter) and in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.ACHR decision in case SERAC v. Nigeria - see para. 60 (p. 25) According to UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, aspects of right to housing under ICESCR include: legal security of tenure; availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure; affordability; habitability; accessibility; location and cultural adequacy.The right to adequate housing (Art.11 (1)). CESCR General comment 4 - see para. 8 As a political goal, right to housing was declared in F. D. Roosevelt's 1944 speech on the Second Bill of Rights. The TENLAW project provided a more efficient opportunity to international and interdisciplinary research in the housing and property field. It created the first housing chair at the University Rovira i Virgili (Spain) on July 11, 2013, which opened up possibilities for research and dissemination in this area.  UN Habitat  The right to adequate housing was a key issue at the 1996 Habitat meeting in Istanbul and a main theme in the Istanbul Agreement and Habitat Agenda. Paragraph 61 of the agenda identifies the steps required by governments to \\"promote, protect and ensure the full and progressive realisation of the right to adequate housing\\". The 2001 Habitat meeting, known as Istanbul +5, reaffirmed the 1996 Istanbul Agreement and Habitat Agenda and established the UN Human Settlement Programme to promote the right to housing in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Known as UN‚ÄìHABITAT, the programme is the most important international forum for the right to housing.

Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, its soundtrack features traditional African rhythms, gospel music by Ranee Lee and a composition by jazz pianist Oliver Jones. Awards for the film included a Golden Bear for best short film at the Berlin International Film Festival and the Jutra Award for best animation. It was also included in the Animation Show of Shows.  Premise  It's the middle of winter in Montreal when an old lady sits down with her grandson to explore the trials and tribulations his ancestors and other Black Canadians endured throughout history, with the aid of Jacques Roumain's book Africa, I have kept your Memory. As each page in the book transforms into the next, the boy becomes fully immersed into the story and begins to discover how those events molded their unique culture today.  Themes  The animated film deals with the idea of memory in the ways it explores the existence of slavery in Canada. At the end of the film, just before the credits there is a blurb reading: \\"In Canada, there were Amerindian and Black Slaves from the XVII to the XIX century\\". Although some would argue that black slavery in Canada was not significant or widely prevalent, it did exist and the enslavement practiced in Canada was illegal for some time. When it was made into law, its purpose was to help drive the economy but was abolished when proven unfeasible. The film honours the memories of slaves and fugitives during that time by telling their stories. The boy is often placed in these significant scenes in history so that he can perhaps identify their struggles. Through this experience, he sees the linkage between their triumphs and the opportunities he's afforded, finding the strength within himself to overcome the challenges that may emerge just as his ancestors did before him.  Production  Chartrand utilizes a traditional animation technique known as paint-on-glass animation. It is considered one of the most demanding animation techniques. Chartrand familiarized herself with this technique when directing MacPherson and since mastered. The process involves manipulating wet media on a glass sheet/sheets, that's often placed on a projector for lighting purposes, all under the lens of a camera recording. Oil paint is often used because it dries slowly which allows an artist to work on a project for longer periods of time. The effect of this technique is the illusion of images seamlessly merging from one scene into the next.Tom Van Laerhoven, Fabian Di Fiore, William Van Haevre, Frank Van Reeth.

Murder Jugelia was shot at 19:30 local time with a Winchester rifle while sitting on the verandah of the cafe Kiki in Sukhumi. Around 19:45 he was brought to the Sukhumi Republican Hospital with severe wounds to his neck and the left axillary region to which he then succumbed. Witnesses reported that a masked man had left his car and shot Jugelia from point-blank range in the back of the head. On 30 January, Apsnypress reported that initial investigations put forward two possible scenarios for the murder: #Since Jugelia was actively fighting against drug trafficking and corruption, it is possible that someone who was directly affected by this decided to remove him. #The murder could have been committed by criminals in order to demonstrate the weakness of the law agencies, and to create a climate profitable for their activities. Earlier investigators had also said that it could not be excluded that Jugelia was murdered by a foreign power in order to hamper the government's work towards socio-economic improvement.

Early career Buller began with an interest in sailboat design. He attended University of British Columbia from 1932 to 1935. Thereafter, he spent several years studying naval architecture in Glasgow, Scotland. In 1937, he switched his focus to aeronautical engineering, moving to Oakland, California to enroll in the Boeing School of Aeronautics. In 1939, he moved to Edmonton, Alberta and began working in the field with Aircraft Repair (later Northwest Industries). In 1943, he relocated to London, Ontario, assisting in the war efforts at Central Aircraft, a subsidiary of de Havilland. In September 1944, he settled in Downsview at de Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd (DHC), where he would remain for 35 years. Later career At de Havilland, Buller, who became its Chief Designer, worked on the designs of a number of notable aircraft, including the Chipmunk and the de Havilland STOL Beaver. The Chipmunk was extensively used in training RAF and RCAF pilots. The Beaver, registered by then de Havilland president P.C. Garratt as ‚ÄòCF-FHB‚Äô in honor of its designer, is on display in the Canadian National Aviation Museum in Ottawa. Buller was also involved in or oversaw the design of the DHC-3 Otter (1951), DHC-4 Caribou (1958), DHC-5 Buffalo (1964), DHC-6 Twin Otter (1965), and DHC-7 Dash 7 (1975). He was a consultant on HMCS Bras D‚Äôor, a hydrofoil commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy. A noted competitor in the 14-footer class (precursor to the International 14) at the Royal Canadian Yacht Club in Toronto and internationally, Buller initially expressed his interest in sailboat design through innovative customization of hulls designed by others (notably Charlie Bourke); his execution of a gybing centreboard was regarded as one of the first truly effective examples. In the early fifties, his Buller I and Buller II advanced both the general design in the class and its use of materials, as both boats were moulded in a material then new, fibreglass. Buller was also credited with bringing the tell-tale, a strip of string or cloth attached to a wing to test its aerodynamic qualities, over to the sailing world. A significant innovation in sailing at the time, sail tell-tales are now common.[Continuous Evolution ‚Äì The Continuing Journey of the Canadian International 14, Parts I, II, Rob Mazza, Kwasind, Aug. 2013, pp 12-23, Kwasind, Sept 2013, pp 12-22] In 1955, Buller became one of the founding members, and a Fellow, of the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute. Frederick Buller died on June 7, 1994 at White Rock, British Columbia. Honors In 1971, the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute awarded Buller its McCurdy Award for his major contributions to the de Havilland family of STOL aircraft. The Engineering Centennial Board named the DHC-2 Beaver as among the ten best engineering accomplishments in Canada in 1987. In 1997 he was inducted into the de Havilland Hall of Fame, and in 1999 he was inducted into Canada‚Äôs Aviation Hall of Fame. For his achievements on the racecourse and as a designer, Buller was in 2013 posthumously inducted into the Canadian International Fourteen Foot Dinghy Hall of Fame.http://i14.ca/news.htm A list of recent inductees.

The organization, based in Columbus, Ohio, says its mission is \\"to advance free-market public policy in the states.\\" History and leadership In 1989, economist Sam Staley founded the Urban Policy Research Institute (UPRI) in Dayton, Ohio. In 1994, UPRI was reorganized into the Buckeye Institute. The organization's original researchers were centered at Wright State University. In 1999, The Buckeye Institute moved from Dayton to Columbus, Ohio. Columbus Mayor Greg Lashutka was a former chair of the organization's board of directors. Matt Mayer, who went on to found Opportunity Ohio, led the organization from 2009 through 2011. Robert Alt, The Buckeye Institute's current president, assumed that role in October 2012. Organizational structure The Buckeye Institute has several research fellows and scholars responsible for conducting the group's research into various public policy debates, including health care, education, and economic development. The Buckeye Institute started a legal advocacy group, the 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, which was eventually spun off on its own. Policy issues The Buckeye Institute has eight focus areas: accountable government, budget and taxes, education, energy and environment, federalism, health care, labor, and legal. In each of those issue areas, Buckeye staff produce peer-reviewed policy reports, provide expert testimony to Ohio's state legislature and the United States Congress, and submit amicus briefs to state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States. As part of its accountable government priority area, the Buckeye Institute also has searchable salary databases, using publicly available information, for local, state, K-12, and higher education public employees. The organization has called its salary databases ‚Äúthe key to transparency‚Äù for government. Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel mirrored the Buckeye Institute's efforts on his own transparency website. =Taxes and spending= The Buckeye Institute has supported a reduction in the Ohio state income tax. The Buckeye Institute has twice published \\"The Piglet Book\\", an account of government spending that it deems wasteful. In 2006, the organization supported a proposed constitutional amendment that would have placed annual limits on the growth of tax revenue and government spending, similar to other states' Taxpayer Bills of Rights. =Education= The Institute produces reports and research that promote a market-based approach to education, including vouchers and charter schools. In 2008, the Buckeye Institute launched a database which includes publicly available information about the salaries of Ohio public school teachers.

Barack Obama has appeared as a character in comic books published by a number of publishing companies, sometimes appearing as a realistic fictionalized version of himself and sometimes as a spoof. Publication history Obama made his first appearance as a comic book character in July 2007 in Licensable BearTM No. 4 by Nat Gertler, where he appeared as a U.S. Senator. The comic only had a print-run of 1,050 issues. A year later, in September 2008, Obama appeared in Erik Larsen‚Äôs Savage Dragon No. 137. This issue featured a variant cover which showed Obama with the Savage Dragon, who proclaims that he is endorsing him for president. The issue sold out four print runs. A month later, the comic was followed up by Presidential Material: Barack Obama by Jeff Mariotte and in November 2008 with Obama: The Comic Book by Rod Espinosa. In November 2008, two things led to an explosion in popularity of the Obama comic book character. One of Obama's advisers gave an interview to journalist Jon Swaine of The Daily Telegraph titled, \\"Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know.\\" In the interview, it emerged that Obama collects \\"Spider-Man and Conan the Barbarian.\\" Then later that month, on November 4, 2008, Obama became the first African-American to be elected President of the United States. When Marvel Comics discovered the president-elect was an avid collector of Spider-Man comics, they decided to have Obama the comic book character be put on the cover of their The Amazing Spider-Man No. 583 (January 2009), for the story \\"Spidey Meets the President!\\" written by Zeb Wells. This particular release proved extremely popular and sold out in a matter of minutes. A day after the release, the edition was sold for $300 on eBay. Prior to the Spider-Man story, the president-elect was featured in Secret Invasion #8; this is the first appearance of president- elect Barack Obama in a Marvel comic. Obama the comic book character has been put on the cover and pages of many other comics including Savage Dragon No. 145 (February 2008) by Erik Larsen and Youngblood No. 8 (February 2008) by Rob Liefeld. The Savage Dragon No. 145 had a special edition variant only offered at the WonderCon 2009 in San Francisco in March 2009 (only 1,500 were produced). On the cover, Barack Obama can be seen holding an American flag and punching Osama Bin Laden in the face. Barack Obama is the subject of graphic novel \\"Barack Hussein Obama\\" by Steven Weissman. In this, President Obama and his cast of characters (Secretary Clinton, VP Joe Biden, his family) experience life in a parallel universe.

He was an Amsterdam Regent during the late 1660s and the early 1670s, and held the titles as Lord of the semi-sovereign Fief Zuid-Polsbroek and 19.th Lord of the Free and high Fief Ilpendam and Purmerland. Pieter de Graeff was a member of a family of regents who belonged to the republican political movement also referred to as the ‚Äòstate oriented‚Äô, as opposed to the Royalists. Biography= Family De Graeff= Pieter was born in Amsterdam, the son of Cornelis de Graeff and Catharina Hooft, and the older brother of Jacob de Graeff.Pieter de Graeffs Biography at digitale bibliothek voor de nederlandse letteren, part II (dutch) Both, Pieters father Cornelis and his uncle Andries de Graeff, were very critical of the Orange family's influence. Together with the Republican political leader Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt, the De Graeff- family strived for the abolition of stadtholdership. They desired the full sovereignty of the individual regions in a form in which the Republic of the United Seven Netherlands was not ruled by a single person. Instead of a sovereign (or stadtholder) the political and military power was lodged with the States General and with the regents of the cities in Holland. During the two decades the De Graeff family had a leading role in the Amsterdam administration, the city was at the peak of its political power. This period was also referred to by Republicans as the ‚ÄòWare Vrijheid‚Äô (True Freedom). It was the First Stadtholderless Period which lasted from 1650 to 1672. During these twenty years, the regents from Holland and in particular those of Amsterdam, controlled the republic. The city was flush with self-confidence and liked to compare itself to the famous Republic of Rome. Even without a stadtholder, things seemed to be going well for the Republic and its regents both politically and economically. =Early years= In 1655 Pieter went together with Joan Huydecoper I and his eldest son Joan on a diplomatic mission to the Prince-elector Frederick William of Brandenburg, to look for support against the war with Sweden. During the summers the family spent a lot of their time at the Palace Soestdijk, and the brothers De Graeff played with the young William III of Orange ‚Äì who later became King of England, Scotland and Ireland and stadtholder of the United Provinces of the Netherlands ‚Äì at the lake and woods at Soestdijk.Catharina Hooft in Vrouwen van Soestdijk (dutch) After Pieter did a Grand Tour through France and England, he married his niece Jacoba Bicker, like himself a cousin of the brothers Cornelis and Johan de Witt. Joost van den Vondel wrote a poem to Pieter and Jacoba's marriage at De Graeff's castle Ilpenstein. =Carriere= In the year 1662 Pieter de Graeff became a member of the vroedschap of the City of Amsterdam. In 1664, after the death of his father Cornelis, he became a chief administrator of the VOC. During the 1660s De Graeff became one of the guardians from William III of Orange. De Graeff was also an advisor and a close friend to Johan De Witt,Pieter de Graeffs Biography at digitale bibliothek voor de nederlandse letteren, part VII (dutch) and after De Witts death in the rampjaar 1672 he became the guardian over his five children.Herbert H. Rowen, John de Witt ‚Äì Statesman of the \\"True Freedom\\", p. 220 After the death of the brothers De Witt and the raise of the House of Orange and Gillis Valckenier, Pieter, his uncle Andries de Graeff and his nephew Lambert Reynst lost their political positions. =Art and Lifestyle= Like his father Cornelis, Pieter de Graeff was also a man who surrounded himself with art and beauty. He was an art collector and patron to the artists Gerard Ter Borch, Jan Lievens, Karel Dujardin, Caspar Netscher and the poet Joost van den Vondel. Prof. C.W. Fock of the University of Leiden describes in her work ‚Äì Het stempel van de bewoner ‚Äì Pieter de Graeffs art-collection and lifestyle. He stand also in close correspondence to Johan de Witt, Jacob Boreel, Van den Vondel, the painter Jan Lievens and the mathematician, astronomer and physicist Christiaan Huygens. From Pieter de Graeff diaries have been preserved. He made several notes on negotiations and payments from his possessions. He encountered some problems with the famous graphical artist Romeyn de Hooghe, who was going to draw an artistic map of De Graeffs estate Valkenburg. Besides he had some maps coloured by the artist David Reerigh, who also coloured several maps of the Hoogheemraadschap of Rijnland of 1687. De Graeff also filled forty almanacs, or some 1600 pages, between 1664 and 1706. Pieter de Graeff died on 3 June 1707; his tomb chapel is to be found in the Oude Kerk at Amsterdam.

History Statistical methods have been used for the purpose of quantitative analysis in comparative linguistics for more than a century. During the 1950s, the Swadesh list emerged: a standardised set of lexical concepts found in most languages, as words or phrases, that allow two or more languages to be compared and contrasted empirically. Probably the first published quantitative historical linguistics study was by Sapir in 1916, while Kroeber and Chretien in 1937 investigated nine Indo-European (IE) languages using 74 morphological and phonological features (extended in 1939 by the inclusion of Hittite). Ross in 1950 carried out an investigation into the theoretical basis for such studies. Swadesh, using word lists, developed lexicostatistics and glottochronology in a series of papers published in the early 1950s but these methods were widely criticised though some of the criticisms were seen as unjustified by other scholars. Embleton published a book on \\"Statistics in Historical Linguistics\\" in 1986 which reviewed previous work and extended the glottochronological method. Dyen, Kruskal and Black carried out a study of the lexicostatistical method on a large IE database in 1992. During the 1990s, there was renewed interest in the topic, based on the application of methods of computational phylogenetics and cladistics. Such projects often involved collaboration by linguistic scholars, and colleagues with expertise in information science and/or biological anthropology. These projects often sought to arrive at an optimal phylogenetic tree (or network), to represent a hypothesis about the evolutionary ancestry and perhaps its language contacts. Pioneers in these methods included the founders of CPHL: computational phylogenetics in historical linguistics (CPHL project): Donald Ringe, Tandy Warnow, Luay Nakhleh and Steven N. Evans. In the mid-1990s a group at Pennsylvania University computerised the comparative method and used a different IE database with 20 ancient languages. In the biological field several software programs were then developed which could have application to historical linguistics. In particular a group at the University of Auckland developed a method that gave controversially old dates for IE languages.Initially announced in A conference on \\"Time-depth in Historical Linguistics\\" was held in August 1999 at which many applications of quantitative methods were discussed.Published by Renfrew, McMahon and Trask in 2000 Subsequently many papers have been published on studies of various language groups as well as comparisons of the methods. Greater media attention was generated in 2003 after the publication by anthropologists Russell Gray and Quentin Atkinson of a short study on Indo-European languages in Nature. Gray and Atkinson attempted to quantify, in a probabilistic sense, the age and relatedness of modern Indo-European languages and, sometimes, the preceding proto-languages. The proceedings of an influential 2004 conference, Phylogenetic Methods and the Prehistory of Languages were published in 2006, edited by Peter Forster and Colin Renfrew. =Studied language families= Computational phylogenetic analyses have been performed for: *Indo-European languages: Bouckaert (2012) *Uralic languages: Honkola (2013) *Turkic languages: Hruschka (2014) *Dravidian languages: Kolipakam (2018) *Austroasiatic languages: Sidwell (2015)Sidwell, Paul. 2015.

(2019) Background The standard method for assessing language relationships has been the comparative method. However this has a number of limitations. Not all linguistic material is suitable as input and there are issues of the linguistic levels on which the method operates. The reconstructed languages are idealized and different scholars can produce different results. Language family trees are often used in conjunction with the method and \\"borrowings\\" must be excluded from the data, which is difficult when borrowing is within a family. It is often claimed that the method is limited in the time depth over which it can operate. The method is difficult to apply and there is no independent test. Thus alternative methods have been sought that have a formalised method, quantify the relationships and can be tested. A goal of comparative historical linguistics is to identify instances of genetic relatedness amongst languages. The steps in quantitative analysis are (i) to devise a procedure based on theoretical grounds, on a particular model or on past experience, etc. (ii) to verify the procedure by applying it to some data where there exists a large body of linguistic opinion for comparison (this may lead to a revision of the procedure of stage (i) or at the extreme of its total abandonment) (iii) to apply the procedure to data where linguistic opinions have not yet been produced, have not yet been firmly established or perhaps are even in conflict. Applying phylogenetic methods to languages is a multi-stage process: (a) the encoding stage - getting from real languages to some expression of the relationships between them in the form of numerical or state data, so that those data can then be used as input to phylogenetic methods (b) the representation stage - applying phylogenetic methods to extract from those numerical and/or state data a signal that is converted into some useful form of representation, usually two dimensional graphical ones such as trees or networks, which synthesise and \\"collapse\\" what are often highly complex multi dimensional relationships in the signal (c) the interpretation stage - assessing those tree and network representations to extract from them what they actually mean for real languages and their relationships through time. Types of trees and networks An output of a quantitative historical linguistic analysis is normally a tree or a network diagram. This allows summary visualisation of the output data but is not the complete result. A tree is a connected acyclic graph, consisting of a set of vertices (also known as \\"nodes\\") and a set of edges (\\"branches\\") each of which connects a pair of vertices. An internal node represents a linguistic ancestor in a phylogenic tree or network. Each language is represented by a path, the paths showing the different states as it evolves. There is only one path between every pair of vertices. Unrooted trees plot the relationship between the input data without assumptions regarding their descent. A rooted tree explicitly identifies a common ancestor, often by specifying a direction of evolution or by including an \\"outgroup\\" that is known to be only distantly related to the set of languages being classified. Most trees are binary, that is a parent has two children. A tree can always be produced even though it is not always appropriate. A different sort of tree is that only based on language similarities / differences. In this case the internal nodes of the graph do not represent ancestors but are introduced to represent the conflict between the different splits (\\"bipartitions\\") in the data analysis. The \\"phenetic distance\\" is the sum of the weights (often represented as lengths) along the path between languages. Sometimes an additional assumption is made that these internal nodes do represent ancestors. When languages converge, usually with word adoption (\\"borrowing\\"), a network model is more appropriate. There will be additional edges to reflect the dual parentage of a language. These edges will be bidirectional if both languages borrow from one another. A tree is thus a simple network, however there are many other types of network. A phylogentic network is one where the taxa are represented by nodes and their evolutionary relationships are represented by branches. Another type is that based on splits, and is a combinatorial generalisation of the split tree. A given set of splits can have more than one representation thus internal nodes may not be ancestors and are only an \\"implicit\\" representation of evolutionary history as distinct from the \\"explicit\\" representation of phylogenetic networks. In a splits network the phrenetic distance is that of the shortest path between two languages. A further type is the reticular network which shows incompatibilities (due to for example to contact) as reticulations and its internal nodes do represent ancestors. A network may also be constructed by adding contact edges to a tree. The last main type is the consensus network formed from trees. These trees may be as a result of bootstrap analysis or samples from a posterior distribution. Language change Change happens continually to languages, but not usually at a constant rate, with its cumulative effect producing splits into dialects, languages and language families. It is generally thought that morphology changes slowest and phonology the quickest. As change happens, less and less evidence of the original language remains. Finally there could be loss of any evidence of relatedness. Changes of one type may not affect other types, for example sound changes do not affect cognancy. Unlike biology, it cannot be assumed that languages all have a common origin and establishing relatedness is necessary. In modelling it is often assumed for simplicity that the characters change independently but this may not be the case. Besides borrowing, there can also be semantic shifts and polymorphism. Analysis input=Data= Analysis can be carried out on the \\"characters\\" of languages or on the \\"distances\\" of the languages. In the former case the input to a language classification generally takes the form of a data matrix where the rows correspond to the various languages being analysed and the columns correspond to different features or characters by which each language may be described. These features are of two types cognates or typological data. Characters can take one or more forms (homoplasy) and can be lexical, morphological or phonological. Cognates are morphemes (lexical or grammatical) or larger constructions. Typological characters can come from any part of the grammar or lexicon. If there are gaps in the data these have to be coded. In addition to the original database of (unscreened) data, in many studies subsets are formed for particular purposes (screened data). In lexicostatistics the features are the meanings of words, or rather semantic slots. Thus the matrix entries are a series of glosses. As originally devised by Swadesh the single most common word for a slot was to be chosen, which can be difficult and subjective because of semantic shift. Later methods may allow more than one meaning to be incorporated. =Constraints= Some methods allow constraints to be placed on language contact geography (isolation by distance) and on sub-group split times. Databases Swadesh originally published a 200 word list but later refined it into a 100 word one. A commonly used IE database is that by Dyen, Kruskal and Black which contains data for 95 languages, though the original is known to contain a few errors. Besides the raw data it also contains cognacy judgements. This is available online.At http://www.idc.upenn.edu The database of Ringe, Warnow and Taylor has information on 24 IE languages, with 22 phonological characters, 15 morphological characters and 333 lexical characters. Gray and Atkinson used a database of 87 languages with 2449 lexical items, based on the Dyen set with the addition of three ancient languages. They incorporated the cognacy judgements of a number of scholars. Other databases have been drawn up for African, Australian and Andean language families, amongst others. Coding of the data may be in binary form or in multistate form. The former is often used but does result in a bias. It has been claimed that there is a constant scale factor between the two coding methods, and that allowance can be made for this. However, another study suggests that the topology may change =Word lists= The word slots are chosen to be as culture- and borrowing- free as possible. The original Swadesh lists are most commonly used but many others have been devised for particular purposes. Often these are shorter than Swadesh's preferred 100 item list. Kessler has written a book on \\"The Significance of Word Lists CSLI Publications, 2001 while McMahon and McMahon carried out studies on the effects of reconstructability and retentiveness. The effect of increasing the number of slots has been studied and a law of diminishing returns found, with about 80 being found satisfactory. However some studies have used less than half this number. Generally each cognate set is represented as a different character but differences between words can also be measured as a distance measurement by sound changes. Distances may also be measured letter by letter. =Morphological features= Traditionally these have been seen as more important than lexical ones and so some studies have put additional weighting on this type of character. Such features were included in the Ringe, Warnow and Taylor IE database for example. However other studies have omitted them. =Typological features= Examples of these features include glottalised constants, tone systems, accusative alignment in nouns, dual number, case number correspondence, object-verb order, and first person singular pronouns. These will be listed in the WALS database, though this is only sparsely populated for many languages yet.Haspelmath et al., World Atlas of Language Structures, OUP 2005 Probabilistic models Some analysis methods incorporate a statistical model of language evolution and use the properties of the model to estimate the evolution history. Statistical models are also used for simulation of data for testing purposes. A stochastic process can be used to describe how a set of characters evolves within a language. The probability with which a character will change can depend on the branch but not all charters evolve together, nor is the rate identical on all branches. It is often assumed that each character evolves independently but this is not always the case. Within a model borrowing and parallel development (homoplasy) may also be modelled, as well as polymorphisms. =Effects of chance= Chance resemblances produce a level of noise against which the required signal of relatedness has to be found. A study was carried out by Ringe On calculating the factor of chance in language comparison, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 82 (1992) into the effects of chance on the mass comparison method. This showed that chance resemblances were critical to the technique and that Greenberg's conclusions could not be justified, though the mathematical procedure used by Rimge was later criticised. With small databases sampling errors can be important. In some cases with a large database and exhaustive search of all possible trees or networks is not feasible because of running time limitations. Thus there is a chance that the optimum solution is not found by heuristic solution-space search methods. Detection of borrowing Loanwords can severely affect the topology of a tree so efforts are made to exclude borrowings. However, undetected ones sometimes still exist. McMahon and McMahon Language Classification by Numbers showed that around 5% borrowing can affect the topology while 10% has significant effects. In networks borrowing produces reticulations. Minett and Wang On detection of borrowing, Diachronia 20/2 (2003) examined ways of detecting borrowing automatically. Split dating Dating of language splits can be determined if it is known how the characters evolve along each branch of a tree. The simplest assumption is that all characters evolve at a single constant rate with time and that this is independent of the tree branch. This was the assumption made in glottochronology. However, studies soon showed that there was variation between languages, some probably due to the presence of unrecognised borrowing.see for example Bergsland and Vogt A better approach is to allow rate variation, and the gamma distribution is usually used because of its mathematical convenience. Studies have also been carried out that show that the character replacement rate depends on the frequency of use.For example, Pagel, Atkinson and Meade, Frequency of word-use predicts rates of lexical evolution throughout Indo-European history, Nature 449, 11 Oct 2007 Widespread borrowing can bias divergence time estimates by making languages seem more similar and hence younger. However, this also makes the ancestor's branch length longer so that the root is unaffected.Atkinson and Gray, How old is the Indo-European family (in Phylogenetic Methods and the Prehistory of Languages, Forster and Renfrew, 2006 This aspect is the most controversial part of quantitative comparative linguistics. Types of analysis There is a need to understand how a language classification method works in order to determine its assumptions and limitations. It may only be valid under certain conditions or be suitable for small databases. The methods differ in their data requirements, their complexity and running time. The methods also differ in their optimisation criteria. =Character based models=Maximum parsimony and maximum compatibility These two methods are similar but the maximum parsimony method's objective is to find the tree (or network) in which the minimum number of evolutionary changes occurs. In some implementations the characters can be given weights and then the objective is to minimise the total weighted sum of the changes. The analysis produces unrooted trees unless an outgroup is used or directed characters. Heuristics are used to find the best tree but optimisation is not guaranteed. The method is often implemented using the programs PAUP or TNT. Maximum compatibility also uses characters, with the objective of finding the tree on which the maximum number of characters evolve without homoplasy. Again the characters can be weighted and when this occurs the objective is to maximise the sum of the weights of compatible characters. It also produces unrooted trees unless additional information is incorporated. There are no readily available heuristics available that are accurate with large databases. This method has only been used by Ringe's group.Indo-European and Computational Cladistics, Transactions of the Philosophical Society 100/1 (2002) In these two methods there are often several trees found with the same score so the usual practice is to find a consensus tree via an algorithm. A majority consensus has bipartitions in more than half of the input trees while a greedy consensus adds bipartitions to the majority tree. The strict consensus tree is the least resolved and contains those splits that are in every tree. Bootstrapping (a statistical resampling strategy) is used to provide branch support values. The technique randomly picks characters from the input data matrix and then the same analysis is used. The support value is the fraction of the runs with that bipartition in the observed tree. However, bootstrapping is very time consuming. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis Both of these methods use explicit evolution models. The maximum likelihood method optimises the probability of producing the observed data, while Bayesian analysis estimates the probability of each tree and so produces a probability distribution. A random walk is made through the \\"model-tree space\\". Both take an indeterminate time to run, and stopping may be arbitrary so a decision is a problem. However, both produce support information for each branch. The assumptions of these methods are overt and are verifiable. The complexity of the model can be increased if required. The model parameters are estimated directly from the input data so assumptions about evolutionary rate are avoided. Perfect Phylogenetic Networks This method produces an explicit phylogenic network having an underlying tree with additional contact edges. Characters can be borrowed but evolve without homoplasy. To produce such networks, a graph-theoretic algorithm Nakhleh et al. Perfect Phylogenic networks, Language 81 (2005) has been used. Gray and Atkinson's method The input lexical data is coded in binary form, with one character for each state of the original multi-state character. The method allows homoplasy and constraints on split times. A likelihood-based analysis method is used, with evolution expressed as a rate matrix. Cognate gain and loss is modelled with a gamma distribution to allow rate variation and with rate smoothing. Because of the vast number of possible trees with many languages, Bayesian inference is used to search for the optimal tree. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm Metropolis et al. 1953 generates a sample of trees as an approximation to the posterior probability distribution. A summary of this distribution can be provided as a greedy consensus tree or network with support values. The method also provides date estimates. The method is accurate when the original characters are binary, and evolve identically and independently of each other under a rates-across-sites model with gamma distributed rates; the dates are accurate when the rate of change is constant. Understanding the performance of the method when the original characters are multi-state is more complicated, since the binary encoding produces characters that are not independent, while the method assumes independence. Nicholls and Gray's method This method http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.799.8282&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf is an outgrowth of Gray and Atkinson's. Rather than having two parameters for a character, this method uses three. The birth rate, death rate of a cognate are specified and its borrowing rate. The birth rate is a Poisson random variable with a single birth of a cognate class but separate deaths of branches are allowed (Dollo parsimony). The method does not allow homoplasy but allows polymorphism and constraints. Its major problem is that it cannot handle missing data (this issue has since been resolved by Ryder and Nicholls. Statistical techniques are used to fit the model to the data. Prior information may be incorporated and an MCMC research is made of possible reconstructions. The method has been applied to Gray and Nichol's database and seems to give similar results. =Distance based models= These use a triangular matrix of pairwise language comparisons. The input character matrix is used to compute the distance matrix either using the Hamming distance or the Levenshtein distance. The former measures the proportion of matching characters while the latter allows costs of the various possible transforms to be included. These methods are fast compared with wholly character based ones. However, these methods do result in information loss. UPGMA The \\"Unweighted Pairwise Group Method with Arithmetic-mean\\" (UPGMA) is a clustering technique which operates by repeatedly joining the two languages that have the smallest distance between them. It operates accurately with clock-like evolution but otherwise it can be in error. This is the method used in Swadesh's original lexicostatistics. Split Decomposition This is a technique for dividing data into natural groups.Bandelt and Dress 1992 The data could be characters but is more usually distance measures. The character counts or distances are used to generate the splits and to compute weights (branch lengths) for the splits. The weighted splits are then represented in a tree or network based on minimising the number of changes between each pair of taxa. There are fast algorithms for generating the collection of splits. The weights are determined from the taxon to taxon distances. Split decomposition is effective when the number of taxa is small or when the signal is not too complicated. Neighbor joining This method operates on distance data, computes a transformation of the input matrix and then computes the minimum distance of the pairs of languages.Saitou and Nei (1987) It operates correctly even if the languages do not evolve with a lexical clock. A weighted version of the method may also be used. The method produces an output tree. It is claimed to be the closest method to manual techniques for tree construction. Neighbor-net It uses a similar algorithm to neighbor joining.Bryant and Moulton : Neighbor-net, an agglomerative method for the construction of phylogenetic networks - Molecular Biology and Evolution 21 (2003) Unlike Split Decomposition it does not fuse nodes immediately but waits until a node has been paired a second time. The tree nodes are then replaced by two and the distance matrix reduced. It can handle large and complicated data sets. However, the output is a phenogram rather than a phylogram. This is the most popular network method. Network This was an early network method that has been used for some language analysis. It was originally developed for genetic sequences with more than one possible origin.Bandelt et al. 1995 Network collapses the alternative trees into a single network. Where there are multiple histories a reticulation (a box shape) is drawn. It generates a list of characters incompatible with a tree. ASP This uses a declarative knowledge representation formalism and the methods of Answer Set Programming.Brooks, Erdem. Minett and Ringe : Character-based cladistics and answer set programming One such solver is CMODELS which can be used for small problems but larger ones require heuristics. Preprocessing is used to determine the informative characters. CMODELS transforms them into a propositional theory that uses a SAT solver to compute the models of this theory. Fitch/Kitch Fitch and Kitch are maximum likelihood based programs in PHYLIP that allow a tree to be rearranged after each addition, unlike NJ. Kitch differs from Fitch in assuming a constant rate of change throughout the tree while Fitch allows for different rates down each branch.McMahon and McMahon Separation level method Holm introduced a method in 2000 to deal with some known problems of lexicostatistical analysis. These are the \\"symplesiomorphy trap\\", where shared archaisms are difficult to distinguish from shared innovations, and the \\"proportionality \\"trap\\" when later changes can obscure early ones. Later he introduced a refined method, called SLD, to take account of the variable word distribution across languages.Holm : The new arboretum of Indo-European trees - Journal of Quantitative Linguistics 14 (2007) The method does not assume aconstant rate of change. Fast convergence methods A number of fast converging analysis methods have been developed for use with large databases (>200 languages). One of these is the Disk Covering Method (DCM).Nakhleh, Roshan, St John, Sun and Warnow : Designing fast converging phylogentic methods - Bioinfomatics, OUP 2001 This has been combined with existing methods to give improved performance. A paper on the DCM-NJ+MP method is given by the same authors in \\"The performance of Phylogenetic Methods on Trees of Bounded Diameter\\", where it is compared with the NJ method. =Resemblance based models= These models compare the letters of words rather than their phonetics. Dunn et al. Structural Phylogenetics and the reconstruction of ancient language history, Science 309, 2072 (2005) studied 125 typological characters across 16 Austronesian and 15 Papuan languages. They compared their results to an MP tree and one constructed by traditional analysis. Significant differences were found. Similarly Wichmann and Saunders How to use typological databases in historical linguistic research, Diachronica 24, 373 (2007) used 96 characters to study 63 American languages. Computerised mass comparison A method that has been suggested for initial inspection of a set of languages to see if they are related was mass comparison. However, this has been severely criticised and fell into disuse. Recently Kessler has resurrected a computerised version of the method but using rigorous hypothesis testing.See for example The Mathematical Assessment of Long Range Linguistic Relationships - Language and Linguistics Compass 2/5 (2008) The aim is to make use of similarities across more than two languages at a time. In another paper Kessler and Lehtonen : Multilateral Comparison and Significance Testing various criteria for comparing word lists are evaluated. It was found that the IE and Uralic families could be reconstructed but there was no evidence for a joint super-family. Nichol's method This method uses stable lexical fields, such as stance verbs, to try to establish long-distance relationships.Nichols : Quasi-cognates and Lexical Type Shifts (in Phylogenetics and the Prehistory of Languages, Forster and Renfrew, 2006) Account is taken of convergence and semantic shifts to search for ancient cognates. A model is outlined and the results of a pilot study are presented. ASJP The Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP) is similar to lexicostatistics, but the judgement of similarities is done by a computer program following a consistent set of rules.Brown et al. : Automated classification of the world's languages, Sprachtypologie und Universalienforschung, 61.4: 285-308, 2008 Trees are generated using standard phylogenetic methods. ASJP uses 7 vowel symbols and 34 consonant symbols. There are also various modifiers. Two words are judged similar if at least two consecutive consonants in the respective words are identical while vowels are also taken into account. The proportion of words with the same meaning judged to be similar for a pair of languages is the Lexical Similarity Percentage (LSP). The Phonological Similarity Percentage (PSP) is also calculated. PSP is then subtracted from the LSP yielding the Subtracted Similarity Percentage (SSP) and the ASJP distance is 100-SSP. Currently there are data on over 4,500 languages and dialects in the ASJP databaseASJP processed languages (March 15, 2010) from which a tree of the world's languages was generated.M√ºller, A., S. Wichmann, V. Velupillai et al. 2010. ASJP World Language Tree of Lexical Similarity: Version 3 (July 2010). Serva and Petroni's method This measures the orthographical distance between words to avoid the subjectivity of cognacy judgements.Indo-European language tree by Levenstein distance It determines the minimum number of operations needed to transform one word into another, normalised by the length of the longer word. A tree is constructed from the distance data by the UPGMA technique. =Phonetic evaluation methods= Heggarty has proposed a means of providing a measure of the degrees of difference between cognates, rather than just yes/no answers.Quantifying change over time in phonetics (in Time-depth in Historical Linguistics, Renfrew, McMahon and Trask, 2001) This is based on examining many (>30) features of the phonetics of the glosses in comparison with the protolanguage. This could require a large amount of work but Heggarty claims that only a representative sample of sounds is necessary. He also examined the rate of change of the phonetics and found a large rate variation, so that it was unsuitable for glottochronology. A similar evaluation of the phonetics had earlier been carried out by Grimes and Agard for Romance languages, but this used only six points of comparison.Linguistic diversity in Romance Languages, Language 35 1959 Evaluation of methods=Metrics= Standard mathematical techniques are available for measuring the similarity/difference of two trees. For consensus trees the Consistency Index (CI) is a measure of homoplasy. For one character it is the ratio of the minimimum conceivable number of steps on any one tree (= 1 for binary trees) divided by the number of reconstructed steps on the tree. The CI of a tree is the sum of the character CIs divided by the number of characters.Kluge and Farris, Systematic Zoology 18, 1-32 (1969) It represents the proportion of patterns correctly assigned. The Retention Index (RI) measures the amount of similarity in a character. It is the ratio (g - s) / (g - m) where g is the greatest number of steps of a character on any tree, m is the minimum number of steps on any tree, and s is the minimum steps on a particular tree. There is also a Rescaled CI which is the product of the CI and RI. For binary trees the standard way of comparing their topology is to use the Robinson-Foulds metric.Robinson and Foulds : Comparison of phylogenetic trees - Mathematical Biosciences - 53 (1981) This distance is the average of the number of false positives and false negatives in terms of branch occurrence. R-F rates above 10% are considered poor matches. For other sorts of trees and for networks there is yet no standard method of comparison. Lists of incompatible characters are produced by some tree producing methods. These can be extremely helpful in analysing the output. Where heuristic methods are used repeatability is an issue. However, standard mathematical techniques are used to overcome this problem. =Comparison with previous analyses= In order to evaluate the methods a well understood family of languages is chosen, with a reliable dataset. This family is often the IE one but others have been used. After applying the methods to be compared to the database, the resulting trees are compared with the reference tree determined by traditional linguistic methods. The aim is to have no conflicts in topology, for example no missing sub-groups, and compatible dates. The families suggested for this analysis by Nichols and Warnow Tutorial on Computational Linguistic Phylogeny, Language and Linguistic Compass 2/5 (2008) are Germanic, Romance, Slavic, Common Turkic, Chinese, and Mixe Zoque as well as older groups such as Oceanic and IE. =Use of simulations= Although the use of real languages does add realism and provides real problems, the above method of validation suffers from the fact that the true evolution of the languages is unknown. By generating a set of data from a simulated evolution correct tree is known. However it will be a simplified version of reality. Thus both evaluation techniques should be used. =Sensitivity analysis= To assess the robustness of a solution it is desirable to vary the input data and constraints, and observe the output. Each variable is changed slightly in turn. This analysis has been carried out in a number of cases and the methods found to be robust, for example by Atkinson and Gray.How old is the Indo- European language family? (in Phylogenic Methods and the Prehistory of Languages, Forster and Renfrew, 2006) Studies comparing methods During the early 1990s, linguist Donald Ringe, with computer scientists Luay Nakhleh and Tandy Warnow, statistician Steven N. Evans and others, began collaborating on research in quantitative comparative linguistic projects. They later founded the CHPL project, the goals of which include: \\"producing and maintaining real linguistic datasets, in particular of Indo-European languages\\", \\"formulating statistical models that capture the evolution of historical linguistic data\\", \\"designing simulation tools and accuracy measures for generating synthetic data for studying the performance of reconstruction methods\\", and \\"developing and implementing statistically-based as well as combinatorial methods for reconstructing language phylogenies, including phylogenetic networks\\".CPHL: Computational Phylogenetics in Historical Linguistics (homepage), 2009 (17 October 2017). A comparison of coding methods was carried out by Rexova et al. (2003).Cladistic analysis of languages, Cladistics 19/2 (2003) They created a reduced data set from the Dyen database but with the addition of Hittite. They produced a standard multistate matrix where the 141 character states corresponds to individual cognate classes, allowing polymorphism. They also joined some cognate classes, to reduce subjectivity and polymorphic states were not allowed. Lastly they produced a binary matrix where each class of words was treated as a separate character. The matrices were analysed by PAUP. It was found that using the binary matrix produced changes near the root of the tree. McMahon and McMahon (2003) used three PHYLIP programs (NJ, Fitch and Kitch) on the DKB dataset.Finding Families, quantitative methods in language classification. Transactions of the Philological Society 101 (2003) They found that the results produced were very similar. Bootstrapping was used to test the robustness of any part of the tree. Later they used subsets of the data to assess its retentiveness and reconstructability. The outputs showed topological differences which were attributed to borrowing. They then also used Network, Split Decomposition, Neighbor-net and Splitstree on several data sets. Significant differences were found between the latter two methods. Neighbor-net was considered optimal for discerning language contact. In 2005, Nakhleh, Warnow, Ringe and Evans carried out a comparison of six analysis methods using an Indo-European database.Nakhleh, Warnow, Ringe and Evans, \\"A Comparison of Phylogenetic Reconstruction Methods on an IE Dataset\\" (2005) The methods compared were UPGMA, NJ MP, MC, WMC and GA. The PAUP software package was used for UPGMA, NJ, and MC as well as computing the majority consensus trees. The RWT database was used but 40 characters were removed due to evidence of polymorphism. Then a screened database was produced excluding all characters that clearly exhibited parallel development, so eliminating 38 features. The trees were evaluated on the basis of the number of incompatible characters and on agreement with established sub-grouping results. They found that UPGMA was clearly worst but there was not a lot of difference between the other methods. The results depended on the data set used. It was found that weighting the characters was important, which requires linguistic judgement. Saunders (2005) Linguistic Phylogenetics for three Austronesian family, BA Thesis Swarthmore College (2005) compared NJ, MP, GA and Neighbor-Net on a combination of lexical and typological data. He recommended use of the GA method but Nichols and Warnow have some concerns about the study methodology.Tutorial on Computational Linguistic Phylogeny Cysouw et al. (2006) A critique of the separation base method for genealogical subgrouping, with data from Mixe-Zoquean, Journal of Quantitative Linguistics 13, 225 (2006) compared Holm's original method with NJ, Fitch, MP and SD. They found Holm's method to be less accurate than the others. In 2013, Fran√ßois Barbancon, Warnow, Evans, Ringe and Nakleh (2013) studied various tree reconstruction methods using simulated data.Barbancon, Warnow, Evans, Ringe and Nakhleh, An Experimental Study Comparing Linguistic Phylogenetic Reconstruction Methods Their simulated data varied in the number of contact edges, the degree of homoplasy, the deviation from a lexical clock, and the deviation from the rates-across-sites assumption. It was found that the accuracy of the unweighted methods (MP, NJ, UPGMA, and GA) were consistent in all the conditions studied, with MP being the best. The accuracy of the two weighted methods (WMC and WMP) depended on the appropriateness of the weighting scheme. With low homoplasy the weighted methods generally produced the more accurate results but inappropriate weighting could make these worse than MP or GA under moderate or high homoplasy levels. Choosing the best model Choice of an appropriate model is critical for the production of good phylogenetic analyses. Both underparameterised or overly restrictive models may produce aberrant behaviour when their underlying assumptions are violated, while overly complex or overparameterised models require long run times and their parameters may be overfit.Sullivan and Joyce, Model selection in phylogenetics, Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematics 36 (2005) The most common method of model selection is the \\"Likelihood Ratio Test\\" which produces an estimate of the fit between the model and the data, but as an alternative the Akaike Information Criterion or the Bayesian Information Criterion can be used. Model selection computer programs are available.

Myriad was a 24-bit machine largely built using integrated circuits from Ferranti which were packaged in small \\"TO-5\\" type cans. The architecture was \\"conventional\\", and was developed largely by the in-house Marconi team that designed similar, but physically larger computers based on SB345 discrete surface-barrier transistors. These machines were used successfully by the Royal Radar Establishment (RRE) and the Road Research Laboratory in the UK. In Sweden they were used by the Government in their \\"Fur Hat\\" defence system and in the Air Force where two computers were used for the meteorological service from the late 1960s to early 1990s. They also provided flight data for UK military air traffic control for 15 years. In Australia, two Myriads were used as part of each of the AF/TPS-802 \\"HUBCAP\\" air-defence systems from 1967‚Äì97. The Myriads were used in a coupled mode with one providing a radar data extractor and data quantiser role, and the other driving display overlays and tactical display information on radar and tactical screens. The Myriad 1 computer was mounted in a small desk format and weighed . Eight bit paper tape was (somewhat) standard input (the software could handle data input in either the ASCII or the rather idiosyncratic KDF9 character codes) ‚Äì but a high speed 1000-characters per second electrostatic reader made by Facit was capable of projecting paper tape across a room in spectacular fashion. A high-speed printer was provided. The major machine cycle time was around 800 nanoseconds, with inner cycles around 200 nanoseconds. Most early programming was performed in very amenable and complete assembly code. Some use was also made of a subset of Coral 66 known as Mini-Coral. The 24-bit architecture provided a logical and flexible address/data environment but the 15-bit address limited the memory size to 32K 24-bit words. The operating system allowed multiple programs to run concurrently but most systems were coded \\"on the bare metal\\". Addressing allowed easy integration of external computing and display equipment. An embedded parallel bus allowed two Myriads and some peripheral expansion devices to be directly addressed. For example, in the \\"Hubcap\\" configuration, two 16k Myriads shared a 32k 4-wire core memory \\"backing store\\" and could save, retrieve or share information at high speed. In 1964, a Myriad prototype was displayed at a major computer show in London.Marconi in Computers and Automation, To catch the public's attention, it was decided to deploy a model HO railroad layout containing numbered (1‚Äì10) rolling stock. The public were invited to enter the order in which they wanted to see the train assembled. Immediately Myriad developed a strategy for shunting trucks around the tracks to assemble the train correctly. Myriad production started in 1965. Myriad II was demonstrated for the first time at the 1966 exhibition in Munich. Alt URL Myriad III was announced in 1970. The Myriad was used in several defence systems and air traffic control systems such as the Linesman/Mediator and the Paris system.Hansard It was used by the National Physics Laboratory UK, and a road traffic control system in Glasgow. In Cambridge a Myriad computer was used to operate the Ryle Telescope tracking eight dishes across the sky, whilst processing the received interference fringe data in real time. Marconi delivered air defence systems coupled to radar to African and Far East counties using the Myriad. When Marconi attempted to open up the North American market considerable interest was given by the City of Montreal for a traffic control system as well as the Lawrence Seaway authority to control the seaway. A proposal to the Canadian Government for air traffic control systems for three Canadian airports was not accepted being deemed to be too advanced for the then current level of training for air traffic controllers. Marconi Automation spent a year developing a proposal in conjunction with Wimpey's of London to produce petrol chemical plant design system which would not only produce accurate tske-off schedules but would flag any instances of pipe conflicts. When Wimpey bought an ICL 1900 computer the management asked that the system be run on that machine. This was not possible. Canadian Marconi in Montreal had very advanced technology in integrated circuits and multiple level printed circuits from doppler navigation unit manufacture for the US Government and so a proposal was put forward to use these technologies for both the Myriad and the Elliot Bros computers. The proposal was not adopted due to Canadian Marconi's lack of computer knowledge. In the late 1960s the Myriad was shown at a computer show in South Africa but unfortunately the machine was dropped out of the transporting aircraft resulting in the chassis being considerably distorted. The Myriad was placed against a wall and pushed back into shape using a fork lift truck. The machine then behaved perfectly at all the events where it was shown. The Myriad was used extensively by the Marconi semiconductor division to design integrated circuits with facilities far in advance of other programs.

It includes all other types of memory including episodic, semantic and procedural.Baddeley, A., Eysenck, M.W. & Anderson, M.C. (2009) \\"Memory\\". New York: Psychology Press. It can be either implicit or explicit. In contrast, prospective memory involves remembering something or remembering to do something after a delay, such as buying groceries on the way home from work. However, it is very closely linked to retrospective memory, since certain aspects of retrospective memory are required for prospective memory. Relationship with prospective memory Early research on prospective memory and retrospective memory has demonstrated that retrospective memory has a role in prospective memory. It was necessary to create more accurate terms in order to explain the relationship fully. Prospective memory describes more accurately an experimental paradigm, therefore, the term prospective remembering was subsequently used.Burgess, P.W. & Shallice, T.(1997)The relationship between prospective and retrospective memory: neuropsychological evidence. In Conway, M.A. (Ed.), Cognitive Models of Memory(247-272). Cambridge: MIT Press. A review by Burgess and Shallice described studies where patients had impaired prospective memory, but intact retrospective memory, and also studies where the impaired retrospective memory caused an impact on prospective memory. A double dissociation for the two has not been found, therefore concluding they are not independent entities. The role of retrospective memory in prospective memory is suggested to be minimal, and takes the form of the information required to make plans. According to Einstein & McDaniel (1990) the retrospective memory component of the prospective remembering task refers to the ability to retain the basic information about action and context. An example used in the reviews explains this in the following scenario: :You are intending to mail a letter on your way home tomorrow evening, at the mailbox that you have used before\\" The basic information of the retrieval context includes time, location and objects, which in combination form the required retrieval context. Each individual representation required is a form of retrospective memory. Despite all the research this issue is still debatable within the scientific community. Episodic memory Retrospective episodic memory is recollection of past episodes. Significant research in this field looks at the phenomenon of mental time travel. =Mental time travel= Mental time travel (MTT) is defined as the ability to mentally project oneself backwards in time to re-live past personal experiences, or forward in time to pre-live possible events in the future.Wheeler, M. A., Stuss, D. T., & Tulving, E. (1997). Toward a theory of episodic memory: The frontal lobes and autonoetic consciousness. Psychological Bulletin,121,331‚Äì354. It is a concept created by Canadian psychologist Endel Tulving. It does not simply refer to knowing an event happened, but requires conscious awareness that the individual is indeed reliving the episode. Due to this, it is certain that mental time travel requires central executive functioning, and most often a conscious ability. However new research has found many cases in which mental time travel occurs involuntarily without consciousness. Specifically research shows this occurs for autobiographical events, and as a result these cases are more specific and detail oriented. An example of this would be the phenomenon of scent: How a particular scent can send an individual back to a specific event in their lifetime. There is also evidence that involuntary and voluntary mental time travel differ on activation levels in areas of the brain suggesting that they have different retrieval mechanisms.Bernsten, D. & Jacobsen, A.S. (2008). Involuntary (spontaneous) mental time travel into the past and future. Consciousness and Cognition, 17 1093-1004. Current research has moved away from the retrospective portion and towards the prospective aspect of mental time travel. There is also extensive research on whether mental time travel is unique to humans as there has been some evidence that it may be possible to occur in animalsMendi, M. & Paul, E.S.(2008). Do animals live in the present? Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 113,(4), 357-382. =Episodic= Retrospective episodic memory is the memory of moments from the past. It is frequently used in studies of Alzheimer patients and testing their dementia. A study by Livner et al. (2009) compared the effect of the disease on both prospective and retrospective memory. In this case the episodic memory being tested was the ability to remember the testing instructions. To test retrospective memory participants were presented with a list of nouns that had been divided into four categories. The results of retrospective memory were divided into three sections: number of categories, number of items remembered and forgetting ratio, in order to look at the three separate process in creating memory (encoding, retrieval, storage). Using their results and knowledge of episodic memory the researchers were able to find a pattern of functional impairments in the brain.Livner, A, Laukka, E.J., Karlsson, S. & Backman, L. (2009). Prospective and retrospective memory in Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia: Similar patterns of impairment. Journal of the Neurological Sciences, 283, 235-2009. =Autobiographical= Retrospective autobiographical memory is recalling specific events from your own past. Testing of this type of memory has been used when researching the effect of emotion and context on memory. Abenavoli and Henkel (2009) conducted a study looking at childhood events, context and metamemory. They wanted to see if the participants memory of remembering childhood events was accurate. The results showed that when context was recreated metamemory improved as did vividness of the actual event. Besides these topics, it is also used in studying mental time travel and age-related factors.Abenavoli, R. & Henkel, L.A. (2009). Remembering When We Last Remembered Our Childhood Experiences: Effects of Age and Context on Retrospective Metamemory Judgements. Applied Cognitive Psychology, 23, 717-732.  Semantic memory  Retrospective semantic memory refers to the collection of knowledge, meaning and concepts that have been acquired over time. It plays a significant role in the study of priming. Jones (2010) researched a pure mediated priming effect and wanted to discover which model accounted for it. Pure priming refers to the connection between two concepts that have a weak or no association with each other. Each of three potential models (spreading activation, compound-cue and semantic matching) were tested with the results concluding that retrospective semantic matching model creates the pure priming effect. This study shows pure priming has more applications than previously thought.Jones, L.J. (2010). Pure Mediated Priming: A Retrospective Semantic Search Model. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 36(1), 135-146. Retrograde amnesia Retrograde amnesia is defined as the loss of memory of events and experiences occurring prior to an illness, accident, injury, or traumatic experience such as rape or assault. The amnesia may cover events over a longer or only a brief period. Typically, it declines with time, with earlier memories returning first.Gordon, M. Retrograde amnesia.\\" A Dictionary of Sociology. 1998. Retrieved March 04, 2010 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-retrogradeamnesia.html There are many possible causes of amnesia. The most common include Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, brain infection (such as encephalitis or meningitis), dementia, seizures, and stroke. Less common causes include a brain tumor or psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, depression, criminal behavior, or psychogenic amnesia). Psychogenic amnesia usually happens in close association with a stressful event that involves serious threat to life or health. There are two types of retrograde amnesia, one dealing with episodic memory, and one dealing with semantic memory. Semantic retrograde amnesia involves loss of generic, lifelong knowledge, as in the various forms of aphasia or agnosia, and also loss of learned motor skills, as in the various types of apraxia. Its primary focus is on retrograde amnesia for specific, usually time-limited, knowledge. In the case of semantic retrograde amnesia, memory for public events and memory for people have formed the primary corpus of research.Kapur, N. (1999). Syndromes of retrograde amnesia: a conceptual and empirical synthesis. Psychological Bulletin, 125(6), 800-825. Neuroanatomy=Medial prefrontal cortex= A study was conducted by Kesner (1989)Kesner, R.P. (1989). Retrospective and prospective coding of information: role of the medial prefrontal cortex. Experimental Brain Research, 74, 163-167. on retrospective memory involving rats. Lesions made to the medial prefrontal cortex of rats led to impairment of retrospective memory, as well as strong impairment to prospective memory on a radial arm task. =Medial temporal lobe= Different brain regions in the medial temporal lobe play a unique role in memory. The medial temporal lobe seems to function as a memory system for consciously available events and facts, and is important for the acquisition of new episodic and semantic memory. There is also evidence that the medial temporal lobe automatically encodes memories.Graham, K.S., & Gaffan, D. (2005). The quarterly journal of experimental psychology. New York, NY: Psychology Press, Ltd. The role of the medial temporal lobe for retrospective memory was assessed by Okuda et al. (2003)Okuda, J., Fujii, T., Ohtake, H., Tukiura, T., Tanji, K., Suzuki, K., et al. (2003). Thinking of the future and the past: the roles of the frontal pole and the medial temporal lobes. Neuroimage, 19, 1369-1380. using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The PET found that thinking about past events increased blood flow to the medial temporal lobes, emphasizing that this brain area contributes to the activation of retrospective memory. Also, the medial temporal lobe displayed activation levels associated with prospective memories. This finding gives support for the belief that thinking about the future to an extent relies upon thinking about the past, showing a close relationship between retrospective memory and prospective memory. =Hippocampus= A Rotating View of the Hippocampus The hippocampus plays an important role for remembering specific personal experiences in humans, as well as memory for sequence of events.Fortin, N.J., Agster, K.L., & Eichenbaum, H.B. (2002). Critical role of the hippocampus in memory for sequences of events. Nature Neuroscience, 5(5), 458-562. A series of lesion studies assessed the role of the hippocampus on retrospective memory. In the first delayed response task, nonhuman primates were shown two food wells. For the primates to get a reward, they had to remember which food well was baited. However, the primate had to retain the information about the two prospects until an apparatus was lowered and raised after a delay interval. The results showed that lesions to the hippocampus impaired performance on this task. In a variation of the study, the primates were required to approach the food well that was empty after a delay. It was found that damage to the thalamus also caused impaired performance on both tasks, but at longer delay intervals. These studies confirmed that damage to the hippocampus and thalamus impaired the recall for episodic memory of previously experienced events.Risberg, J. & Grafman, J. (Ed.). (2006). The frontal lobes: Development, function and pathology. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. In a lesion study involving rats, Ferbinteanu and Shapiro (2003)Ferbinteanu, J., & Shapiro, M.L. (2003) Prospective and retrospective memory coding in the hippocampus. Neuron, 40, 1227-1239. found the importance of the hippocampus for correctly remembering past events. In the study, rats with fornix lesions displayed poor choice accuracy in a spatial task requiring memory for temporal context, which was seen as evidence for impaired retrospective memory. In an earlier study, Kametani and Kesner (1989)Kametani, H., & Kesner, R.P. (1989). Retrospective and prospective coding of information: dissociation of parietal cortex and hippocampal formation. Behavioural Neuroscience, 103(1), 84-89. found that rats with lesions in the hippocampus made a large number of errors on a radial arm maze, indicating impaired retrospective memory for points of interpolation within the maze. =Thalamus= A Rotating View of the Thalamus It is known that the thalamus plays a crucial role in memory.Cheng, H., Tian, Y., Hu, P., Wang, J., & Wang, K. (2010). Time-based prospective memory impairment with thalamus stroke. Behavioral Neuroscience, 124(1), 152-58. While investigating stroke-patients with damage to the thalamus, Cipolotti et al. (2008)Cipolotti, L., Husain, M., Crinion, J., Bard, C.M., Khan, S.S., et al. (2008). The role of the thalamus in amnesia: a tractography, high- resolution MRI and neuropsychological study. Neuropsychologia, 46, 2745-2758. found that the stroke victims had poor recognition and recall memory on verbal and non-verbal tests. The poor recall identified that the retrospective memory of the patients was being effected by the damage on the thalamus due to stroke. Lesions to the thalamus have been found to impair the recognition memory of monkeys. In a study conducted by Aggleton and Mishkin, they found that monkeys with lesions to the anterior thalamus and the posterior thalamus had an impaired ability for recognition and associative memory on matching tests. The researchers also suggested that combined damage to both regions of the thalamus can lead to amnesia.Aggleton, J.P., & Mishkin, M. (1983). Memory impairments following restricted medial thalamic lesions in monkeys. Experimental Brain Research. 52, 199-209. =Amygdala= A Rotating View of the Amygdala The amygdala plays a special role in that it is crucial to the emotional aspect of retrospective memory. It is responsible for the encoding of emotionally laden events, and there is evidence that memories for emotional events are more vivid than other memories.Phelps, E.A. (2004). Human emotion and memory: Interactions of the amygdala and hippocampal complex. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, (14), 198-202. The amygdala has been associated with memories for past emotional events. A number of studies have provided evidence that the amygdala acts as an intermediate for emotionally influenced memory. These studies have investigated lesions of the amygdala in animals and humans.McGaugh, J.L., Cahill, L. and Roozendaal, B. (1996). Involvement of the amygdala in memory storage: Interaction with other brain systems. National Academy of Sciences, (93) 24, 13508-13514. Imaging studies have shown that amygdala activation is associated with emotional memory, and that past emotional memories are often better remembered than neutral memories. It has also been seen that the amygdala enhances memory in relation to the intensity of emotion in past experience, as well as enhancing declarative memory for emotional experiences.Canli, T., Zhao, Z., Brewer, J., Gabrieli, J.D.E., Cahill, L. (2000). Event-related activation in the human amygdala associates with later memory for individual emotional experience. The Journal of Neuroscience,(20), 1-5. Hamann et al. (1999)Hamann, S.B., Ely, T.D., Grafton, S.T., Kilts, C.D. (1999). Amygdala activity related to enhanced memory for pleasant and aversive stimuli. Nature Neuroscience, (2) 3, 289-293. also found that emotional events (both pleasant and aversive) are better remembered than neutral events. They went on to find that the amygdala plays a crucial role for enhancing the strength of long-term and episodic memory. Using PET, the amygdala was shown to be responsible for enhanced episodic memory in the recognition of emotional stimuli. Measures of assessment=PRMQ= The Prospective/Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) was developed by Smith et al. in order to study Alzheimer patients.Smith, G., Della Sala, S., Logie, R.H. & Maylor, E.A. (2000). Prospective and retrospective memory in normal ageing and dementia: A questionnaire study. Memory,8(5), 311-321. It is a 16-item questionnaire on which participants indicate the frequency in which they make certain memory errors. They use a 5-point scale (Very Often, Quite Often, Sometimes, Rarely, Never). Categories tested include prospective short term and long term, as well as retrospective short term and long-term memory. It is different from previous questionnaires because it has the ability to compare prospective and retrospective memory across several conditions. Since its creation, it has been used in numerous studies to look at the effects of Alzheimer's disease on prospective memory and retrospective memory. =MET/SET= ; MET or Multiple Errands test :Participants are given a set of shopping activities that must be completed in real time in a shopping area. Certain aspects, such as remembering to be in a specific place at a specific time, involve prospective memory. Other aspects such as remembering the exact activity involve retrospective memory. By looking at the performance of the participants at certain tasks, the experimenters can determine the effects of prospective and retrospective memory on each other.Shallice, T. & Burgess P.W. (1991). Higher order cognitive impairments and frontal lobe lesions in man. In Levin, H.S., Eisenberg, H.M. & Benton, A.L.(Eds.), \\"Frontal lobe function and injury\\" (125-138). Oxford: Oxford University Press. ;SET or the Six Element test :Participants are given six open-ended tasks that must be completed in 15 minutes. Two of these tasks require dictating a route, two involve writing down the names of pictures of objects, and two ask the participant to complete a series of math problems. There is not enough time to complete all the tasks, therefore the participant is required to allocate appropriate timing to each task. Aspects of the test that show the effects of retrospective memory include remembering that they had created an order in which to do the tasks. =Classic short term memory tests= ;Digit span :A test for short-term retrospective memory. Participants are presented verbally with a list of digits. They are subsequently asked to recall them in the order they were presented. ;Free recall :A test for short-term retrospective memory. Participants are presented with a sequence of items and are subsequently asked to recall them in any order. ;Word recall :Similar to free recall; instead of digits, words are substituted. ;Facial recognition :A test for short term retrospective memory. Participants are presented with images of faces and subsequently asked to recall them at a later period. =Issues in testing= Often involve testing both prospective and retrospective memory; sometimes difficult to isolate one. Additionally, Mantyla (2003) compared the results of the PRMQ to word recall tests of RM and found that they did not match. In this study retrospective memory performance did not match retrospective memory scores on PRMQ.Mantyla, T. (2003). Assessing absentmindedness: Prospective memory complaint and impairment in middle-aged adults. \\"Memory and Cognition,31, 15-25. Factors affecting retrospective memory=Age= Age is a significant factor that effects memory. There is tremendous evidence that infants can learn and remember. However, infantile amnesia is an important, yet difficult area to study. Events from infancy simply cannot be remembered. Many studies have tried and failed to determine the cause of this. Consequently, many theories have been developed to explain this phenomenon.Kail, R., Spear, N.E. Comparative Perspectives on the Development of Memory. Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., 1984. These theories range from the Freudian psychodynamic theory that remembering events from infancy would be damaging to the \\"ego\\", to theories that explain the underdeveloped hippocampus of an infant, and also theories that conclude that infants have not yet developed autonoetic consciousness of having experienced remembered events.Perner J. and Ruffman T. Episodic Memory and Autonoetic Consciousness: Developmental Evidence and a Theory of Childhood Amnesia. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 59 (3), 516-548. This theory relies on Tulving's view of episodic memory. Three studies were conducted to examine the differences in specificity at retrieval between younger adults (age range: 19‚Äì25 years, mean = 21.5 years), and older adults (age range: 64‚Äì82 years, mean = 74.1 years). It was found that older adults had lower retrieval for high specificity tests, but not for low specificity. And it was also found that the effects of divided attention on retrieval of younger adults mimicked the effects of aging. Therefore, retrieval efficiency depends on effortful, resource-demanding retrieval processes that is diminished in older adults.Lin Luo *, Fergus I.M. Craik. 2009. Age differences in recollection: Specificity effects at retrieval. Journal of Memory and Language, 60 (4), 421-436. As we age, the ventricles in the brain get larger as our brains get smaller. Functional changes do not normally depend on total brain size, but rather which part of the brain is getting smaller. The frontal lobes usually shrink more quickly, and the temporal and occipital lobes are slower. 20‚Äì30% of neurons in the hippocampus (which plays a critical role in memory) are lost by the age of 80. It has also been found that dopamine levels decrease by 5‚Äì10% per decade. This neurotransmitter plays a critical role in neural cognition (decrease associated with Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease). =Sex= Some differences in memory performance have been observed between men and women. A series of experiments revealed that women did better at verbal episodic memory tasks (ex. remembering words, objects, pictures and everyday events), tasks with both verbal and visuospatial processing (ex. remembering the location of car keys), and tasks requiring little to no verbal processing (ex. recognition of familiar odours). Men, on the other hand, were better at purely visuospatial processing (ex. remembering symbolic or non-linguistic information). All of these differences may vary due to environmental factors such as education.Herlitz, A. & Rehnman, J. 2008. Sex Differences in Episodic Memory. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 17 (1), 52‚Äì56. =Trauma=Emotional It has been found that even though memory usually declines with age, elderly people tend to remember more positive memories than negative or even neutral ones. As we grow older, we focus more on positive things and start to develop the skill of emotion regulation which is \\"monitoring, evaluating, altering and gating one's emotional reactions and memories about emotional experiences\\". This is also referred to as motivated forgetting. An unusual form of motivated forgetting is called psychogenic amnesia in which a very severe emotional stressor causes one to lose a large amount of personal memories without an observable biological cause. Another reaction to a very severe stressor is called post traumatic stress disorder. People who have been subject to a traumatic event that has included death of others or a possibility of death or severe injury to oneself cannot forget these memories. This sometimes leads to flashbacks and nightmares that cause people to re-live these traumatic events for long periods afterwards.Canadian Mental Health Association. (2010) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Retrieved from http://www.cmha.ca/bins/content_page.asp?cid=3-94-97 Causes of traumatic brain injury that may lead to loss of retrospective memory Miron-Shatz et al. looked at life as we actually live it and the differences that emerge when recalling it. The goal was to discover if there are qualitative differences for remembering pleasant versus unpleasant events. It was discovered that gaps occur for both pleasant and unpleasant events; however they were more pronounced for unpleasant events, meaning pleasant events were recalled as neutral events, but unpleasant events were recalled at extremely unpleasant. These findings support the notion that unpleasant events have a stronger impact on our recall.Miron-Shatz, T., Stone, A., Kahnemana, D. (2009) Memories of Yesterday's Emotions: Does the Valence of Experience Affect the Memory- Experience Gap? Emotion 9(6): 885-891. Physical Traumatic brain injury happens when the head suffers from a sharp blow, or suddenly accelerates or decelerates. In these cases, the brain gets churned around, and can be damaged by the bony bumps and knobs inside the skull, or by the twisting and tearing of fibres in the brain. If the traumatic brain injury is severe enough, it can lead to an initial coma, which is then followed by a time of post-traumatic amnesia. Post traumatic amnesia typically resolves itself gradually, however it will leave a mild, but permanent deficit in the patient's memory. Lesions to certain areas of the brain may lead to cognitive and memory deficits ‚Äì see Neuroanatomy section above. =Drugs= A study by de Win et al. used advanced magnetic resonance and SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging techniques on the same sample study to determine if any functional differences appear in the brains of MDMA users. It is almost impossible to find purely MDMA users (without the use of cannabis, cocaine or other amphetamines), but with statistical analysis, it was found that MDMA has specific serotonergic damaging effects on the thalamus. This damage was speculated to be axonal damage to serotonergic cells while cell bodies remained intact. This damage is at least partly responsible for the commonly found reduced verbal memory in users.de Win, M.M.L., Jager, G., Booij, J., Reneman, L., Schilt, T., Lavini, C., Olabarriaga, S.D., Ramsey, N.F., den Heeten, G.J., and van den Brink, W.(2008) Neurotoxic effects of ecstasy on the thalamus. The British Journal of Psychiatry 193(4): p. 289-296. Conflicting results have been found by many studies that have looked at brain anatomy in frequent marijuana users. The goal is to determine whether or not marijuana has any effects on cognitive abilities (including memory). A study done by Jager et al. concluded that there are in fact anatomical differences between the brains of frequent marijuana users and non-using control samples. Frequent users showed a lower magnitude of activity (but no structural changes) in parahippocampal regions. However, when subject to associative memory tasks, users performed within normal ranges. This shows that a decrease in activation in these regions is associated with frequent marijuana use, but does not affect memory task performance.Jager, G., Van Hella, H.H., de Win, M.M.L., Kahna, R.S., Van Den Brink, W., Van Reed, J.M., and Ramsey, N.F. (2007) Effects of frequent cannabis use on hippocampal activity during an associative memory task. European Neuropsychopharmacology 17(4): 289-297 This is still a controversial issue, and more research is required to draw conclusive results. =Disease=Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60 to 70 percent of cases of dementias. The brains of Alzheimer's patients have an abundance of plaques and tangles which begin in areas involved in memory, spreading to other areas, and eventually affecting most of the brain. Vascular dementia is often considered the second- most common form of dementia and is the reduction of blood flow to parts of the brain most often caused by many very small strokes that have an accumulative effect on cognitive abilities including memory.Alzheimer's Association.

Thiamine is necessary for the body to process carbohydrates. This thiamine dificiency can lead to symptoms such as: confusion, loss of balance, drowsiness, and some specific problems with vision. When the deficiency is considered severe, the memory loss may be accompanied by agitation and dementia. The standard treatment is intravenous thiamine, administered as soon as possible after symptoms become apparent. Unfortunately, the treatment does not correct the condition and recovery is known to be gradual and sometimes incomplete. Temporally graded retrograde amnesia extending back several decades (early memories in life) are a common feature of patients with the alcoholic Korsakoff's syndrome, which primarily affects the diencephalon, usually with concomitant frontal lobe atrophy.Verfaellie, M.

This self-awareness of memory has important implications for how people learn and use memories. When studying, for example, students make judgments of whether they have successfully learned the assigned material and use these decisions, known as \\"judgments of learning\\", to allocate study time.  History  Descartes, among other philosophers, marveled at the phenomenon of what we now know as metacognition.Metcalfe, J. (2000). \\"Metamemory: Theory and data\\", pp. 197‚Äì211 in E. Tulving & F.I.M. Craik (Eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Memory. New York: Oxford University Press. \\"It was not so much thinking that was indisputable to Descartes, but rather thinking about thinking. He could not imagine that the person engaged in such self-reflective processing did not exist\\". In the late 19th century, Bowne and James contemplated, but did not scientifically examine, the relationship between memory judgments and memory performance. During the reign of behaviorism in the mid-20th century, unobservable phenomena such as metacognition were largely ignored. One early scientific study of metamemory was Hart's 1965 study, which examined the accuracy of feeling of knowing (FOK). FOK occurs when an individual feels that they have something in memory that cannot be recalled, but would be recognized if seen.Radvansky, G. (2006). Human Memory. Boston: Pearson Education Group. Hart expanded upon limited investigations of FOK which had presupposed that FOK was accurate. The results of Hart's study indicate that FOK is indeed a relatively accurate indicator of what is in memory. In a 1970 review of memory research, Tulving and Madigan concluded that advances in the study of memory might require the experimental investigation of ‚Äúone of the truly unique characteristics of human memory: its knowledge of its own knowledge‚Äù. It was around the same time that John H. Flavell coined the term \\"metamemory\\" in a discussion on the development of memory. Since then, numerous metamemory phenomena have been studied, including judgments of learning, feelings of knowing, knowing that you don't know, and know vs. remember. Nelson and Narens proposed a theoretical framework for understanding metacognition and metamemory. In this framework there are two levels: the object level (for example, cognition and memory) and the meta level (for example, metacognition and metamemory). Information flow from the meta level to the object level is called control, and information flow from the object level to the meta level is called monitoring. Both monitoring and control processes occur in acquisition, retention, and retrieval. Examples of control processes are allocating study time and selecting search strategies, and examples of monitoring processes are ease-of-learning (EOL) judgments and FOK judgments. The study of metamemory has some similarities to introspection in that it assumes that a memorizer is able to investigate and report on the contents of memory. Current metamemory researchers acknowledge that an individual's introspections contain both accuracies and distortions and are interested in what this conscious monitoring (even if it is not always accurate) reveals about the memory system.  Theories = Cue familiarity hypothesis = The cue familiarity hypothesis was proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing a pair of experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability to answer a question before trying to answer it. This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgments regarding metamemory are based on an individual's level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual is more likely to judge that they know the answer to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the answer to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms. = Accessibility hypothesis = The accessibility hypothesis suggests that memory will be accurate when the ease of processing (accessibility) is correlated with memory behaviour; however, if the ease of processing is not correlated with memory in a given task, then the judgments will not be accurate. Proposed by Koriat, the theory suggests that participants base their judgments on retrieved information rather than basing them on the sheer familiarity of the cues. Along with the lexical unit, people may use partial information that could be correct or incorrect. According to Koriat, the participants themselves do not know whether the information they are retrieving is correct or incorrect most of the time. The quality of information retrieved depends on individual elements of that information. The individual elements of information differ in strength and speed of access to the information. Research by Vigliocco, Antonini, and Garrett (1997) and Miozzo and Caramazza (1997) showed that individuals in a tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) state were able to retrieve partial knowledge (gender) about the unrecalled words, providing strong evidence for the accessibility heuristic. = Competition hypothesis = The competition hypothesis is best described using three principles. The first is that many brain systems are activated by visual input, and the activations by these different inputs compete for processing access. Secondly, competition occurs in multiple brain systems and is integrated amongst these individual systems. Finally, competition can be assessed (using top-down neural priming) based on the relevant characteristics of the object at hand. More competition, also referred to as more interfering activation, leads to poorer recall when tested. This hypothesis contrasts with the cue-familiarity hypothesis because objects similar to the target can influence one's FOK, not just similar associates of the cues. It also contrasts with the accessibility hypothesis wherein the more accessible information is, the higher the rating, or the better the recall. According to the competition hypothesis, less activation would result in better recall. Whereas the accessibility view predicts higher metamemory ratings in interference conditions, the competition hypothesis predicts lower ratings. = Interactive hypothesis = The interactive hypothesis constitutes a combination of the cue familiarity and accessibility hypotheses. According to this hypothesis, cue familiarity is employed initially, and only once cue familiarity fails to provide enough information to make an inference does accessibility come into play. This \\"cascade\\" structure accounts for differences in the time required to make a metamemory judgment; judgments which occur quickly are based on cue familiarity, while slower responses are based on both cue familiarity and accessibility.  Phenomena = Judgment of learning = Judgments of learning (JOLs) or metamemory judgments are made when knowledge is acquired. Metamnemonic judgments are based on different sources of information, and target information is important for JOLs. Intrinsic cues (based on the target information) and mnemonic cues (based on previous JOL performance) are especially important for JOLs. Judgment of learning can be divided into four categories: ease-of-learning judgments, paired-associate JOLs, ease-of- recognition judgments, and free-recall JOLs. Ease-of-Learning Judgments: These judgments are made before a study trial. Subjects can evaluate how much studying will be required to learn the particular information presented to them (typically cue-target pairs). These judgments can be categorized as preacquisition judgments which are made before the knowledge is stored. Little research addresses this kind of judgment; however, evidence suggests that JOLs are at least somewhat accurate at predicting learning rates. Therefore, these judgments occur in advance of learning and allow individuals to allot study time to the material that they are required to learn. Paired-Associate Judgment of Learning: These judgments are made at the time of study on cue- target pairs and are responsible for predicting later memory performance (on cued recall or cued recognition). One example of paired-associate JOLs is the cue-target JOL, where the subject determines the retrievability of the target when both the cue and target of the to-be-learned pair are presented. Another example is the cue-only JOL, where the subject must determine the retrievability of the target when only the cue is presented at the time of judgment. These two types of JOLs differ in their accuracy in predicting future performance, and delayed judgments tend to be more accurate. Ease-of- Recognition Judgments: This type of JOL predicts the likelihood of future recognition. Subjects are given a list of words and asked to make judgments concerning their later ability to recognize these words as old or new in a recognition test. This helps determine their ability to recognize the words after acquisition. Free-Recall Judgments of Learning: This type of JOL predicts the likelihood of future free-recall. In this situation, subjects assess a single target item and judge the likelihood of later free-recall. It may appear similar to ease-of-recognition judgments, but it predicts recall instead of recognition. = Feeling of knowing judgments = Feeling Of Knowing example: Even if you cannot remember that the name of the city you are traveling to is Cusco, you may feel that you would recognize the name if shown a map of Peru. Feeling of Knowing (FOK) judgments refer to the predictions an individual makes of being able to retrieve specific information (i.e., regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject) and, more specifically, whether that knowledge exists within the person's memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but you feel that you would recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country. An individual's FOK judgments are not necessarily accurate, and attributes of all three metamemory hypotheses are apparent in the factors that influence FOK judgments and their accuracy. For example, a person is more likely to give a higher FOK rating (indicating that they do know the answer) when presented with questions they feel they should know the answer to. This is in keeping with the cue familiarity hypothesis, as the familiarity of the question terms influences the individual's judgment. Partial retrieval also impacts FOK judgments, as proposed by the accessibility hypothesis. The accuracy of an FOK judgment is dependent upon the accuracy of the partial information which is retrieved. Consequently, accurate partial information leads to accurate FOK judgments, while inaccurate partial information leads to inaccurate FOK judgments. FOK judgments are also influenced by the number of memory traces linked to the cue. When a cue is linked to fewer memory traces, resulting in a low level of competition, a higher FOK rating is given, thus supporting the competition hypothesis. Certain physiological states can also influence an individual's FOK judgments. Altitude, for instance, has been shown to reduce FOK judgments, despite having no effect on recall. In contrast, alcohol intoxication results in reduced recall while having no effect on FOK judgments. = Knowing that you do not know = When someone asks a person a question such as \\"What is your name?\\", the person automatically knows the answer. However, when someone asks a person a question such as \\"What was the fifth dinosaur ever discovered?\\", the person also automatically knows that they do not know the answer. dinosaur ever discovered was, it is likely that you would know that you did not know the answer. A person knowing that they do not know is another aspect of metamemory that enables people to respond quickly when asked a question that they do not know the answer to. In other words, people are aware of the fact that they do not know certain information and do not have to go through the process of trying to find the answer within their memories, since they know the information in question will never be remembered. One theory as to why this knowledge of not knowing is so rapidly retrieved is consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis. The cue familiarity hypothesis states that metamemory judgments are made based on the familiarity of the information presented in the cue. The more familiar the information in the memory cue, the more likely a person will make the judgment that they know that the target information is in memory. With regards to knowing that you don't know, if the memory cue information does not elicit any familiarity, then a person quickly judges that the information is not stored in memory. The right ventral prefrontal cortex and the insular cortex are specific to \\"knowing that you don't know\\", whereas prefrontal regions are generally more specific to the feeling of knowing. These findings suggest that a person knowing that they do not know and feeling of knowing are two neuroanatomically dissociable features of metamemory. As well, \\"knowing that you don't know\\" relies more on cue familiarity than feeling of knowing does. There are two basic types of \\"do not know\\" decisions. First is a slow, low confidence decision. This occurs when a person has some knowledge relevant to the question asked. This knowledge is located and evaluated to determine whether the question can be answered based on what is stored in memory. In this case, the relevant knowledge is not enough to answer the question. Second, when a person has zero knowledge relevant to a question asked, they are able to produce a rapid response of not knowing. This occurs because the initial search for information draws a blank and the search stops, thus producing a faster response. = Remember vs. know = The quality of information that is recalled can vary greatly depending on the information being remembered. It is important to understand the differences between remembering something and knowing something. If information about the learning context accompanies a memory (i.e. the setting), it is called a \\"remember\\" experience. However, if a person does not consciously remember the context in which he or she learned a particular piece of information and only has the feeling of familiarity towards it, it is called a \\"know\\" experience. An example to demonstrate this would be ‚Äòremembering‚Äô what you were doing when you heard a devastating piece of information( eg 9/11) versus ‚Äòknowing‚Äô who the 1st president of the United States is.It is widely believed that recognition has two underlying processes: recollection and familiarity. The recollection process retrieves memories from one's past and can elicit any number of associations of the prior experience (\\"remember\\"). In contrast, the familiarity process does not elicit associations with the memory and there are no contextual details of the prior learning occurrence (\\"know\\"). Since these two processes are dissociable, they can be affected by different variables (i.e. when remember is affected know is not and vice versa). For example, \\"remember\\" is affected by variables such as depth of processing, generation effects, the frequency of occurrence, divided attention at learning, and reading silently vs. aloud. In contrast, \\"know\\" is affected by repetition priming, stimulus modality, amount of maintenance rehearsal, and suppression of focal attention. There are cases however, where \\"remember\\" and \\"know\\" are both affected, but in opposite ways. An example of this would be if \\"remember\\" responses are more common than \\"know\\" responses. This can occur due to word versus nonword memory, massed versus distributed practice, gradual versus abrupt presentations, and learning in a way that emphasizes similarities vs. differences. Another aspect of the \\"remember\\" versus \\"know\\" phenomenon is hindsight bias, also referred to as the \\"knew it all along effect\\". This occurs when a person believes that an event is more deterministic after it has happened. That is, in the face of the outcome of a situation, people tend to overestimate the quality of their previous knowledge, thus leading the person to a distortion towards the provided information. Some researchers believe that the original information gets distorted by the new information at the time of encoding. The term \\"creeping determinism\\" is used to emphasize the fact that it is completely natural for one to integrate outcome information with the original information to create an appropriate whole out of all the pertinent information. Reprinted: Although it was found that informing individuals about the hindsight bias before they took part in experiments did not decrease the bias, it is possible to avoid the effects of the hindsight bias. Further, by discrediting the outcome knowledge, people are better able to accurately retrieve their original knowledge state, therefore reducing the hindsight bias. Errors in being able to differentiate between ‚Äòremembering‚Äô versus ‚Äòknowing‚Äô can be attributed to a phenomenon known as source monitoring. This is a framework where one tries to identify the context or source from which a particular memory or event has arisen. This is more prevalent with information that is ‚Äòknown‚Äô rather than ‚Äòremembered‚Äô. = Prospective memory = Remembering to call your sister on her birthday is an example of time- based prospective memory. It is important to be able to keep track of future intentions and plans, and most importantly, individuals need to remember to actually carry out such intentions and plans. This memory for future events is prospective memory. Prospective memory includes forming the intention to carry out a particular task in the future, which action we‚Äôre going to use to carry out the action, and when we want to do it. Thus, prospective memory is in use continuously in day-to-day life. For example, prospective memory is in use when you decide that you need to write and send a letter to a friend. There are two types of prospective memory; event-based and time based. Event-based prospective memory is when an environmental cue prompts you to carry out a task. An example is when seeing a friend reminds you to ask him a question. In contrast, time-based prospective memory occurs when you remember to carry out a task at a specific time. An example of this is remembering to phone your sister on her birthday. Time-based prospective memory is more difficult than event-based prospective memory because there is no environmental cue prompting one to remember to carry out the task at that specific time. In some cases, impairments to prospective memory can have dire consequences. If an individual with diabetes cannot remember to take their medication, he or she might face serious health consequences. Prospective memory also generally gets worse with age, but the elderly can implement strategies to improve prospective memory performance.  Improving memory = Mnemonics = A mnemonic is \\"a word, sentence, or picture device or technique for improving or strengthening memory\\".Information learnt through mnemonics makes use of a form of deep processing, elaborative encoding. It uses mnemonic tools such as imagery in order to encode specific information with the goal of creating an association between the tool and the information. This leads to the information becoming more accessible and therefore leads to better retention. One example of a mnemonic is the method of loci, in which the memorizer associates each to be remembered item with a different well-known location. Then, during retrieval, the memorizer \\"strolls\\" along the locations and remembers each related item.Other types of mnemonic tools including the creating acronyms, the drawing effect( which states drawing something increases the likelihood of remembering it), chunking and organisation and imagery(where you associate images with the information you are trying to remember). The application of a mnemonic is intentional, suggesting that in order to successfully use a mnemonic device an individual should be aware that the mnemonic can aid his or her memory. Awareness of how a mnemonic facilitates one's memory is an example of metamemory. Wimmer and Tornquist conducted an experiment in which participants were asked to recall a set of items. Participants were made aware of the usefulness of a mnemonic device (categorical grouping) either before or after recall. Participants who were made aware of the usefulness of the mnemonic before recall (displaying metamemory for the mnemonic's usefulness) were significantly more likely to use the mnemonic than those who were not made aware of the mnemonic before recall. = Exceptional memory = Some mnemonists can remember thousands of digits of pi. Mnemonists are people with exceptional memory. These individuals have seemingly effortless memories and perform tasks that may seem challenging to the general population. They seem to have beyond normal abilities to encode and retrieve information. There is strong evidence suggesting that exceptional performance is acquired, rather than it being a natural ability, and that \\"ordinary\\" people can improve their memory drastically with the use of appropriate practice and strategies such as mnemonics. However it is important to acknowledge that although sometimes these well developed tools increase memorisation capabilities in general, more often than not, mnemonists tend to have a domain they have specialise in. In other words one strategy doesn't work for all sorts of memorisations. Because metamemory is important for the selection and application of strategies, it is also important for the improvement of memory. There are a number of mnemonists who specialise in different areas of memory and make use of different strategies to do so. For example, Ericsson et al. conducted a study with an undergraduate student \\"S.F.\\" who had an initial digit span of 7 (within the normal range). This means that, on average, he was able to recall sequences of 7 random numbers after they were presented. Following more than 230 hours of practice, S.F. was able to increase his digit span to 79. S.F.'s use of mnemonics was essential. He used race times, ages, and dates to categorize the numbers, creating mnemonic associations. Another example of a mnemonist is Suresh Kumar Sharma, who hold the world record for reciting the most digits of pi( 70,030). Brain-imaging conducted by Tanaka et al. reveals that subjects with exceptional performance activate some brain regions that are different from those activated by control participants. Some memory performance tasks in which people display exceptional memory are chess, medicine, auditing, computer programming, bridge, physics, sports, typing, juggling, dance, and music.  Physiological influences = Neurological disorders = In a review of research on patients with various neurological disorders, Pannu et al. found that metamemory was affected by various neurological disorders, including Korsakoff's amnesia, frontal lobe injury, multiple sclerosis and HIV. Other disorders, such as temporal lobe epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury had mixed results, and disorders such as Parkinson's syndrome and Huntington's syndrome showed no effect. In their review, Pannu and Kaszniak reached 4 conclusions: > (1) There is a strong correlation between indices of frontal lobe function > or structural integrity and metamemory accuracy (2) The combination of > frontal lobe dysfunction and poor memory severely impairs metamemorial > processes (3) Metamemory tasks vary in subject performance levels, and quite > likely, in the underlying processes these different tasks measure, and (4) > Metamemory, as measured by experimental tasks, may dissociate from basic > memory retrieval processes and from global judgments of memory.  Frontal lobe injury  The lobes of the brain. The frontal lobe is shown in blue. Neurobiological research of metamemory is in its early stages, but recent evidence suggests that the frontal lobe is involved. A study of patients with medial prefrontal cortex damage showed that feeling-of-knowing judgments and memory confidence were lower than in controls. Studies suggest that right frontal lobe, especially the medial frontal area, is important for metamemory. Damage to this area is associated with impaired metamemory, especially for weak memory traces and effortful episodic tasks.  Korsakoff's syndrome  Individuals with Korsakoff's syndrome, the result of thiamine deficiency in chronic alcoholics, have damage to the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary nuclei, as well as degeneration of the frontal lobes. They display both amnesia and poor metamemory. Shimamura and Squire found that while patients with Korsakoff's syndrome displayed impaired FOK judgments, other amnesic patients did not.  HIV  Pannu and Kaszniak found that patients with HIV had impaired metamemory. However, a later study focusing on HIV found that this impairment was primarily caused by the general fatigue associated with the disease.  Multiple sclerosis  Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes demyelination of the central nervous system. One study found that individuals with MS displayed impaired metamemory for tasks that required high monitoring, but metamemory for easier tasks was not impaired.  Other disorders  Individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy display impaired metamemory for some tasks and not for others, but little research has been conducted in this area. One of the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is decreased memory performance, but there are inconclusive results regarding metamemory in AD. Metamemory impairment is commonly observed in individuals late in the progression of AD, and some studies also find metamemory impairment early in AD, while others do not. Individuals with either Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease do not appear to have impaired metamemory. = Maturation = Generally, metamemory improves as children mature. In general, metamemory improves as children mature, but even preschoolers can display accurate metamemory. There are three areas of metamemory that improve with age. 1) Declarative metamemory ‚Äì As children mature they gain knowledge of memory strategies. 2) Self-control ‚Äì As children mature they generally become better at allocating study time. 3) Self-monitoring ‚Äì Older children are better than younger children at JOL and EOL judgments. Children can be taught to improve their metamemory through instruction programs at school. Research suggests that children with ADHD may fall behind in the development of metamemory as preschoolers. In a recent study on metacognition, measures of metamemory (such as study time allocation) and executive function were found to decline with age. This contradicts earlier studies, which showed no decline when metamemory was dissociated from other forms of memory and even suggested that metamemory could improve with age. In a cross-sectional study, it was found that the confidence people have in the accuracy of their memory remains relatively constant across age groups, despite the memory impairment that occurs in other forms of memory in the elderly. This is likely the reason why the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon becomes more common with age. = Pharmacology = In a study of self-reported effects of MDMA (ecstasy) on metamemory, metamemory variables such as memory- related feelings/beliefs and self-reported memory were examined. Results suggest that drug use may cause retrospective memory failures. Although other factors such as high anxiety levels of drug users might contribute to memory failure, drug use can impair metamemory abilities. Further, research has shown that benzodiazepine lorazepam has effects on metamemory. When studying four- letter nonsense words, persons on benzodiazepine lorazepam displayed impaired episodic short-term memory and lower FOK estimates. However, benzodiazepine lorazepam did not affect the predictive accuracy of FOK judgments.  References  Further reading  * Dunlosky, J., & Bjork, R.A. (Eds). (2008).

As a master mason, Lechler's writing gives insight into Gothic architecture from the perspective of a builder as opposed to the more common contemporary perspectives written by clerics.Shelby 1977, p.5 Career Lechler's Instructions, was written for his son Moritz in 1516,Coldstream 2002, p.55Shelby 1977, p.40 at a time when the Late Gothic was being displaced by the Renaissance.Frankl, 1960, p. 152 He writes that \\"[a]n honourable work glorifies its master, if it stands up,\\" and goes on to show how elevation measurements are taken from a ground plan specifically in the construction of a late medieval German hall church.Coldstream, 1991, p. 33 Lechler describes how the width of a church choir becomes the modular unit for producing other construction measurements.

The differences found between linguistic memory and musical memory have led researchers to theorize that musical memory is encoded differently from language and may constitute an independent part of the phonological loop. The use of this term is problematic, however, since it implies input from a verbal system, whereas music is in principle nonverbal. PDF Document Neurological bases Consistent with hemispheric lateralization, there is evidence to suggest that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are responsible for different components of musical memory. By studying the learning curves of patients who have had damage to either their left or right medial temporal lobes, Wilson & Saling (2008) found hemispheric differences in the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobes in melodic memory. Ayotte, Peretz, Rousseau, Bard & Bojanowski (2000) found that those patients who had their left middle cerebral artery cut in response to an aneurysm suffered greater impairments when performing tasks of musical long-term memory, than those patients who had their right middle cerebral artery cut. Thus, they concluded that the left hemisphere is mainly important for musical representation in long-term memory, whereas the right is needed primarily to mediate access to this memory. Sampson and Zatorre (1991) studied patients with severe epilepsy who underwent surgery for relief as well as control subjects. They found deficits in memory recognition for text regardless of whether it was sung or spoken after a left, but not right temporal lobectomy. However, melody recognition when a tune was sung with new words (as compared to encoding) was impaired after either right or left temporal lobectomy. Finally, after a right but not left temporal lobectomy, impairments of melody recognition occurred in the absence of lyrics. This suggests dual memory codes for musical memory, with the verbal code utilizing the left temporal lobe structures and the melodic relying on the encoding involved. Semantic vs. episodic Platel (2005) defined musical semantic memory as memory for pieces without memory for the temporal or spatial elements; and musical episodic memory as memory for pieces and the context in which they were learned. It was found that two distinct patterns of neural activations existed when comparing semantic and episodic components of musical memory. Controlling for processes of early auditory analysis, working memory and mental imagery, Platel found that retrieval of semantic musical memory involved activation in the right inferior and middle frontal gyri, the superior and inferior right temporal gyri, the right anterior cingulate gyrus and parietal lobe region. There was also some activation in the middle and inferior frontal gyri in the left hemisphere. Retrieval of episodic musical memory resulted in activation bilaterally in the middle and superior frontal gyri and the precuneus. Although bilateral activation was found there was dominance in the right hemisphere. This research suggests independence of episodic and semantic musical memory. The Levitin Effect demonstrates accurate semantic memory for musical pitch and tempo among listeners, even without musical training, and without episodic memory of the original learning context. Individual differences=Sex= Gaab, Keenan & Schlaug (2003) found a difference between males and females in the processing and subsequent memory for pitch using fMRI. More specifically, males showed more lateralized activity in the anterior and posterior perisylvin regions with greater activation in the left. Males also had more cerebellar activation than females did. However, females showed more posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex activation than did males. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the behavioural performance did not differ between males and females. =Handedness= It has been found by Deutsch that lefthanders with mixed hand preference outperform righthanders in tests of short-term memory for pitch. This may be due to more storage of information on both sides of the brain by the mixed lefthanded group. Atypical cases=Expertise= Experts have tremendous experience through practice and education in a particular field. Musical experts use some of the same strategies as do many experts in fields that require large amounts of memorization: chunking, organization and practice. For example, musical experts may organize notes into scales or create a hierarchical retrieval scheme to facilitate retrieval from long-term memory. In a case study on an expert pianist, researchers Chaffin & Imreh (2002) found that a retrieval scheme was developed to guarantee that the music was recalled with ease. This expert used auditory and motor memory along with conceptual memory. Together the auditory and motor representations allow for automaticity during performance, whereas the conceptual memory is mainly used to mediate when the piece is getting off track. When studying concert soloists, Chaffin and Logan (2006) reiterate that a hierarchical organization exists in memory, but also take this a step further suggesting that they actually use a mental map of the piece allowing them to keep track of the progression of the piece. Chaffin and Logan (2006) also demonstrate that there are performance cues that monitor the automatic aspects of performance and adjust them accordingly. They distinguish between basic performance cues, interpretive performance cues, and expressive performance cues. Basic cues monitor technical features, interpretive cues monitor changes made in different aspects of the piece, and expressive cues monitor the feelings of the music. These cues are developed when experts pay attention to a particular aspect during practice. =Savantism= A savant syndrome is described as a person with a low IQ but who has superior performance in one particular field. Sloboda, Hermelin and O'Connor (1985) discussed a patient, NP, who was able to memorize very complex musical pieces after hearing them three or four times. NP's performance exceeded that of experts with very high IQs. However, his performance on other memory tasks was average for a person with an IQ in his range. They used NP to suggest that high IQ is not needed for the skill of musical memorization and in fact, other factors must be influencing this performance. Miller (1987) also studied a 7-year-old child who was said to be a musical savant. This child had superior short-term memory for music that was found to be influenced by the attention given to the complexity of the music, the key signature, and repeated configurations within a string. Miller (1987) suggests that a savant's ability is due to encoding the information into already existing meaningful structures in long-term memory. =Child prodigies= Ruthsatz & Detterman (2003) define a prodigy as a child (younger than 10) who is able to excel at \\"culturally relevant\\" tasks to an extent that even isn't seen often in professionals in the field. They describe a case of one particular boy who had already released two CDs (on which he sings in 2 different languages) and was able to play several instruments by the age of 6. Other observations that were made of this young child were that he had: * performed numerous concerts * appeared twice on national TV * appeared in two movies * played highly expressive music * come from a family with no particular abilities in music * never had lessons, he had just listened to others' pieces used improvisation * an IQ of 132 (two standard deviations above the average) * an extraordinary memory in all domains Amusia Amusia is also known as tone deafness. Amusics primarily have deficits in processing pitch. They also have problems with musical memory, singing and timing. Amusics also cannot tell melodies apart from their rhythm or beat. However, amusics can recognize other sounds at a normal level (i.e. lyrics, voices, and sounds from the environment), therefore demonstrating that amusia is not due to deficits in exposure, hearing or cognition. Effects on non-musical memory Music has been shown to improve memory in several situations. In one study of musical effects on memory, visual cues (filmed events) were paired with background music. Later, participants who could not recall details of the scene were presented with the background music as a cue and recovered the inaccessible scene information. Other research provides support for memory of text being improved by musical training. Words presented by song were remembered significantly better than when presented by speech. Earlier research has supported for this finding, that advertising jingles that pair words with music are remembered better than words alone or spoken words with music in the background. Memory was also enhanced for pairing brands with their proper slogans if the advertising incorporated lyrics and music rather than spoken words and music in the background. Training in music has also been shown to improve verbal memory in children and adults. Participants trained in music and participants without a musical background were tested for immediate recall of words and recall of words after 15 minute delays. Word lists were presented orally to each participant 3 times and then participants recalled as many words as they could. Even when matched for intelligence, the musically trained participants tested better than non-musically trained participants. The authors of this research suggest that musical training enhances verbal memory processing due to neuroanatomical changes in the left temporal lobe, (responsible for verbal memory) which is supported by previous research. MRI has been used to show that this region of the brain is larger in musicians than non-musicians, which may be due to changes in cortical organization contributing to improved cognitive function. Anecdotal evidence, from an amnesic patient named CH who suffered from declarative memory deficits, was obtained supporting a preserved memory capacity for song titles. CH's unique knowledge of accordion music allowed for experimenters to test verbal and musical associations. When presented with song titles CH was able to successfully play the correct song 100% of the time, and when presented with the melody she chose the appropriate title from several distractors with a 90% success rate. Interference Interference occurs when information in short-term memory interferes with or obstructs the retrieval of other information. Some researchers believe that interference in memory for pitch is due to a general limited capacity of the short-term memory system, regardless of the type of information that it retains. However, Deutsch has shown that memory for pitch is subject to interference based on the presentation of other pitches but not by the presentation of spoken numbers. Further work has shown that short-term memory for the pitch of a tone is subject to highly specific effects produced by other tones, which depend on the pitch relationship between the interfering tones and the tone to be remembered. PDF Document PDF Document PDF Document It appears, therefore, that memory for pitch is the function of a highly organized system that specifically retains pitch information. Any additional information present at the time of comprehension has the ability to displace the target information from short-term memory. Therefore, there is potential that one's ability to understand and remember will be compromised if one studies with the television or radio on.Radvansky, G. (2006). Human Memory. Pearson / Allyn and Bacon While studies have reported inconsistent results with regards to music's effect on memory, it has been demonstrated that music is able to interfere with various memory tasks. It has been demonstrated that new situations require new combinations of cognitive processing. This subsequently results in conscious attention being drawn to novel aspects of situations.Snyder, B. (2000) Music and memory: An introduction. The MIT Press. Cambridge 291. Therefore, the loudness of music presentation along with other musical elements can assist in distracting one from normal responses by encouraging attentiveness to the musical information. Attention and recall have been shown to be negatively affected by the presence of a distraction. Wolfe (1983) cautions that educators and therapists should be made aware of the potential for environments with sounds occurring simultaneously from many sources (musical and non-musical) to distract and interfere with student learning. =Introversion and extroversion= Researchers Campbell and Hawley (1982) provided evidence of the regulation of arousal differences between introverts and extroverts. They found that when studying in a library, extroverts were more likely to choose to work in areas with bustle and activity, while introverts were more likely to choose a quiet, secluded area. Accordingly, Adrian Furnham and Anna Bradley discovered that introverts presented with music at the time of two cognitive tasks (prose recall and reading comprehension) performed significantly worse on a test of memory recall than extroverts who were also presented with music at the time of the tasks. However, if music was not present at the time of the tasks, introverts and extroverts performed at the same level. =Hemispheric interference= Recent research has demonstrated that the normal right hemisphere of the brain responds to melody holistically, consistent with Gestalt Psychology, whereas the left hemisphere of the brain evaluates melodic passages in a more analytic fashion, similar to the feature-detecting capacity of the left hemisphere's visual field. For instance, Regalski (1977) demonstrated that while listening to the melody of the popular carol \\"Silent Night\\", the right hemisphere thinks, \\"Ah, yes, Silent Night\\", while the left hemisphere thinks, \\"two sequences: the first a literal repetition, the second a repetition at different pitch levels‚Äîah, yes, Silent Night by Franz Gruber, typical pastorate folk style.\\" The brain for the most part works well when each hemisphere performs its own function while solving a task or problem; the two hemispheres are quite complementary. However, situations arise when the two modes are in conflict, resulting in one hemisphere interfering with the operation of the other hemisphere. Testing=Absolute pitch= Absolute pitch (AP) is the ability to produce or recognize specific pitches without reference to an external standard. PDF Document People boasting AP have internalized pitch references, and thus are able to maintain stable representations of pitch in long-term memory. AP is regarded as a rare and somewhat mysterious ability, occurring in as few as 1 in 10,000 people. A method commonly used to test for AP is as follows: subjects are first asked to close their eyes and imagine that a specific song is playing in their heads. Encouraged to start anywhere in the tune they like, subjects are instructed to try to reproduce the tones of that song by singing, humming, or whistling. Productions made by the subject are then recorded on digitally. Lastly, the subjects' productions are compared to the actual tones sung by the artists. Errors are measured in semitone deviations from the correct pitch. This test, however, does not determine whether or not the subject has true absolute pitch, but rather is a test of implicit absolute pitch. Where true absolute pitch is concerned, Deutsch and colleagues have shown that music conservatory students who are speakers of tone languages have a far higher prevalence of absolute pitch than do speakers of nontone languages such as English. Weblink PDF Document PDF Document PDF Document For a test of absolute pitch see the Absolute Pitch Test developed by Deutsch and colleagues at the University of California San Diego. =Testing= The ability to recognize incorrect pitch (musical) is most often tested by using the Distorted Tunes Test (DTT). The DTT was originally developed in the 1940s and was used in large studies in the British population. The DTT measures musical pitch recognition ability on an ordinal scale, scored as the number of correctly classified tunes. More specifically the DTT is used to evaluate subjects on how well they judge whether simple popular melodies contain notes with incorrect pitch. Researchers have used this method to investigate genetic correlates of musical pitch recognition in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Drayna, Manichaikul, Lange, Snieder and Spector (2001) determined that the variation in musical pitch recognition is primarily due to highly heritable differences in auditory functions not tested by conventional audiologic methods. Therefore, the DTT method may provide a benefit to advancing research studies similar to this one. =In infants= The following testing procedure has been used to assess infants' ability to recall familiar, yet complex pieces of music, and also their preference for timbre and tempo. The following procedure has demonstrated not only that infants attend longer to familiar than to unfamiliar pieces of music but also that infants remember the tempo and timbre of the familiarized melodies over long periods of time. This has been demonstrated by the fact that by changing the tempo or timbre at test, one eliminates an infant's preference for the novel melody. Thus, indicating that infants' long-term memory representations are not simply of the abstract musical structure, but contain surface or performance features as well. This testing procedure contains three phases: #Familiarization: The selected musical piece is given to parents/caretakers on a CD. Parents and caretakers are instructed to listen to the musical piece three times a day, when the infant is in a quiet and alert state and the home environment is calm and peaceful. #Retention: CDs are collected from the parents/caretakers immediately after the familiarization phase to ensure that no listening of the familiar piece occurs during the two-week retention phase. #Test: Finally, infants are tested in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a behavioral data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with the infant sitting on the lap of his or her mother. A light is located on either side of the infant. The trial begins when the infant is looking straight ahead. Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting earphones which deliver masking music for the duration of the entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias the infant's response. During each trial, one sidelight flashes, urging the infant to look at it. Once the infant turns his or her head and looks at the light, the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or the infant looks away. When the infant turns away from the source for at least two seconds, sound and light turn off and the trial ends. A new trial begins when the infant looks at the center panel again.Ilari, B. S. (July 2002). Music Cognition in Infancy: Infants' Preferences and Long-Term Memory for Complex Music. Faculty of Music. McGill University, Montreal Lyrical vs. instrumental memory Many students listen to music while they study. Many of these students maintain that the reasons why they listen to music are to prevent drowsiness and to maintain their arousal for study. Some even believe that background music facilitates better work performance. However, Salame and Baddeley (1989) showed that both vocal and instrumental music interfered with performance of linguistic memory. They explained that disturbance in performance was caused by task-irrelevant phonological information using resources in the working memory system. This disturbance can be explained by the fact that the linguistic component of music can occupy the phonological loop, similar to the way speech does. This is further demonstrated by the fact that vocal music has been perceived to interfere more with memory than instrumental music and nature sound music. Rolla (1993) explains that lyrics, being language, develop images that allow for the interpretation of experience in the communicative process.Rolla, G. M. (1993) Your inner music: Creative Analysis and Music Memory. Workbook/Journal. Chiron Publications. Wilmette, Illinois. Current research coincides with this idea and maintains that the sharing of experience by language in song may communicate feeling and mood much more directly than either language itself or instrumental music alone. Vocal music also affects emotion and mood much more swiftly than instrumental music. However, Fogelson (1973) reported instrumental music interfered with children's performance on a reading comprehension test. Development Neural structures form and become more sophisticated as a result of experience. For example, the preference for consonance, the harmony or agreement of components, over dissonance, an unstable tone combination, is found early in development. Research suggests that this is due to both the experiencing of structured sounds and the fact they stem from development of the basilar membrane and auditory nerve, two early developing structures in the brain. An incoming auditory stimulus evokes responses measured in the form of an event- related potential (ERP), measured brain responses resulting directly from a thought or perception. There is a difference in ERP measures for normally developing infants ranging from 2‚Äì6 months in age. Measures in infants 4 months and older demonstrate faster, more negative ERPs. In contrast, newborns and infants up to 4 months of age show slow, unsynchronized, positive ERPs. Trainor, et al. (2003) hypothesized that these results indicated that responses from infants less than four months of age are produced by subcortical auditory structures, whereas with older infants responses tend to originate in the higher cortical structures. =Relative and absolute pitch= There are two methods of encoding/remembering music. The first process is known as relative pitch, which refers to a person's ability to identify the intervals between given tones. Therefore, the song is learned as a continuous succession of intervals. Some people can also use absolute pitch in the process; this is ability to name or replicate a tone without reference to an external standard. Another term used in rare cases is the idea of perfect pitch. Perfect pitch refers to seeing or hearing any given note and being able to sing or cite the determined note/interval respectively. Relative pitch has also been credited by some with being the more sophisticated of the two processes as it allows for quick recognition regardless of pitch, timbre or quality, as well as having the ability to produce physiological responses, for example, if the melody violates the learned relative pitch. Relative pitch has been shown to develop at varying rates dependent on culture. Trehub and Schellenberg (2008) found that 5- and 6-year-old Japanese children performed significantly better at a task requiring the utilization of relative pitch than same-aged Canadian children. They hypothesized that this could be because the Japanese children have more exposure to pitch accent via Japanese language and culture than the predominantly stressed environment Canadian children experience. =Plasticity of musical development= Early acquisition of relative pitch allows for accelerated learning of scales and intervals. Musical training assists with the attentional and executive functioning necessary to interpret and efficiently encode music. In conjunction with brain plasticity, these processes become more and more stable. However, this process expresses a degree of circular logic in that the more learning that takes place, the greater the stability of the processes, ultimately decreasing overall brain plasticity. This could possibly explain the discrepancy in amount of effort both children and adults have to put into mastering new tasks. Models=Modal model= Atkinson and Shiffrin's 1968 model consists of separate components for short and long term memory storage. It states that short-term memory is limited by its capacity and duration. Research suggests that musical short-term memory is stored differently from verbal short-term memory. Berz (1995) found dissimilar results for the correlation between modality and recency effects in language versus music, suggesting that different encoding processes are engaged. Berz also demonstrated different levels of interference on tasks as a result of language stimulus vs. musical stimulus. Finally Berz provided evidence for a separate store theory through the \\"Unattended Music Effect\\", stating \\"If there was a singular acoustic store, unattended instrumental music would cause the same disruptions on verbal performance as would unattended vocal music or unattended vocal speech; this, however, [is] not the case\\". =Baddeley and Hitch's model of working memory= Baddeley and Hitch's 1974 Model consists of three components; one main component, the central executive and two sub components, the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad.Baddeley, A. (1990) Human Memory: Theory and practice, Boston: Allyn and Bacon The central executive's primary role is to mediate between the two sub-systems. The visuospatial sketchpad holds information about what we see. The phonological loop can be further divided into: the Articulatory control system, the \\"inner voice\\" responsible for verbal rehearsal; and the Phonological store, the \\"inner ear\\" responsible for speech-based storage. Major criticisms of this model include a lack of musical processing/encoding and an ignorance towards other sensory inputs regarding the encoding and storage of olfactory, gustatory, and tactile inputs. =Theoretical model of memory= This theoretical model proposed by William Berz (1995) is based on the Baddeley and Hitch model. However, Berz modified the model to include a musical memory loop as a loose addition (meaning, almost a separate loop altogether) to the phonological loop. This new musical perceptual loop contains musical inner speech in addition to the verbal inner speech provided by the original phonological loop. He also proposed another loop to include other sensory inputs that were disregarded in the Baddeley and Hitch model. =Koelsch's model= In a model outlined by Stefan Koelsch and Walter Siebel, music stimuli are perceived in a successive timeline, breaking down the auditory input into different characteristics and meaning. He maintained that upon perception the sound reaches the auditory nerve, brainstem and thalamus. At this point features involving pitch height, chroma, timbre, intensity and roughness are extracted. This occurs about at about 10‚Äì100ms. Next, melodic and rhythmic grouping occurs, which is then perceived by auditory sensory memory. After this, an analysis is made of intervals and chord progressions. A harmony is then built upon the structure of metre, rhythm and timbre. This occurs from about 180‚Äì400ms after the initial perception. Following this, structural reanalysis and repair occur, at about 600‚Äì900ms. Finally, the autonomic nervous system and multimodal association cortices are activated. Koelsch and Siebel proposed that from about 250‚Äì500ms, based on the sound's meaning, interpretation and emotion occurs continuously throughout this process. This is indicated by N400, a negative spike at 400ms, as measured by an \\"event related potential\\".
