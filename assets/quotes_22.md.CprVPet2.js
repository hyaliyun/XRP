McKecknie (1862-1934) was an American architect working in Kansas City, Missouri, who applied the principles of reinforced concrete in the construction of commercial structures clad in a repertory of classical motifs. He produced designs for some 120 commercial buildings, residences and apartment blocks, establishing the monumental character of West Armour Boulevard with more than a dozen colonnaded apartment blocks. Several of his structures are now registered in the National Register of Historic Places, and others contribute to their Historic District designations.The material for this article is drawn from the National Register of Historic Places registration form for the Stine and McClure Undertaking Company Building and other registration forms. Born in Clarksville, Ohio, McKechnie studied for two years at Wilmington College, Wilmington, Ohio, (1880‚Äì82) before entering Princeton University (AB, 1886), which he followed with two years at the Columbia School of Mines, New York City. He worked in New York for Cady, Berg & See, architects of the original Metropolitan Opera House and the American Museum of Natural History. McKechnie taught evening courses in architecture at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, predecessor of the Brooklyn Museum, and installed full-scale sections of the Parthenon Notre Dame de Paris and other structures at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In 1895 he toured Italy, documenting and drawing architecture. The results, supporting Prof. William H. Goodyear's theory that mathematical regularity in ancient buildings was the exception rather than the rule, was published in the Architectural Record, 1896‚Äì97. In 1897/98 McKechnie moved to the booming city of Kansas City, Missouri, to work at first as architect for the builders Hucke & Sexton. By 1900 he had opened his own practice; in 1914 he was joined by his long-term employee Frank TraskTrask, a graduate of Columbia University School of Architecture, joined McKechnie as draftsman in 1903; following McKechnie's death he practiced on his own and died in 1968 (National Register of Historic Places registration form for Montgormery Ward Warehouse). as partner.

The village lies on the northern side of the island of Rad√∏y about a 50-minute drive north of the city of Bergen. There are about 400 inhabitants in the Sletta area. It is the site of the Emigrant Church, Sletta. Geography The green island of Rad√∏y is an elongated island with parallel fjords and valleys, which were created during the Devonian period. Sletta is not an exception, and has flower fields and the flat and steep landscape is excellent for sheep. The area is rich on spruce (especially sitka spruce), pine, and rowan. History As Rad√∏y was historically divided amongst several municipalities, Sletta was a part of Lind√•s municipality until 1964. Since Sletta lies on a different side of Lurefjorden than the rest of Lind√•s, the easiest transport was by boat. It was even better than walking over the hills to Manger and the rest of Rad√∏y. The people at Sletta actually felt more in common with the people on the other side of the fjord. As the car became an important travel method, almost all of Rad√∏y was merged in 1964 and Manger became the hub, so Sletta and the surrounding area was transferred to the new municipality of Rad√∏y. Culture Sletta has a primary school with approximately 50 pupils. In addition, the main football field at Rad√∏y, is situated at Sletta. Rad√∏y/Manger is the main football team.

It dates to the sixteenth century, although parts may be older, and formerly belonged to the Stewart or Shaw-Stewart family. It was designated as a Category B listed building in 1971.  History  The first house on the site was built by the Norman knight Walter fitz Alan in about 1160. In 1396 Robert III of Scotland, King of Scots, gave the property to Sir John Stewart, his natural son. According to a record book now lost, barony courts were regularly held there in the sixteenth century. In 1667 Archibald Stewart was made a Baronet of Nova Scotia by Charles II, and was the first baronet of Greenock and Blackhall. By the 1820s Blackhall had become a farm-house; in the 1840s the farmer built a new house nearby, and the roof of the old one was taken off to save on tax. The structure was used as a store-house, a cattle byre and a coal shed. The Shaw-Stewart family donated it to the Burgh of Paisley in 1940. In 1978 it was judged to have become so dangerous that demolition was proposed. It was completely rebuilt and restored in 1982‚Äì1983. No information about the evolution of the tower over the centuries is available, but the presence of a 14th-century fireplace jamb, the different style of windows in the staircase tower from the rest of the building and its relatively poor bonding with the main block suggest that the tower house was originally built as a hall house and enlarged in the 16th century with the addition of another storey and attic, stair tower, larger windows and a new ground-floor entrance. More windows were added in the late 16th or early 17th centuries. FootnotesFurther reading * The Place of Blackhall ‚Äì the Story of Eight Centuries,\\" Janet S.

Established by a group of independent distillers in 1885, it is now a joint venture company between Diageo and Edrington Group. It is Edinburgh‚Äôs last working distillery, widely known as the \\"NB\\". History The conglomeration of railway lines around the entrance (located under the second bridge) to the North British Distillery in Wheatfield Road, Gorgie With grain whisky consumption growing in the industrialised and railway connected Victorian era, independent distillers needed access to a high quality and high volume producer of pure grain alcohol. In 1885, major shareholders Andrew Usher, William Sanderson and John M. Crabbie, with numerous other whisky-blenders as shareholders, had established the North British Distillery Company Limited. The company bought a pig farm on the western outskirts of Edinburgh, adjacent to the developing suburb of Gorgie and Dalry. The site had a number of distinct advantages: *Direct access to the developing national railway network via the Edinburgh Suburban and Southside Junction Railway, allowing input access for grain and output distribution of product *Close access to the Port of Leith, allowing easy import of grain and later maize *The new main city sewer ran less than from the site, allowing easy flushout of effluent Production started in 1887, and within a year of opening the distillery was producing of spirit per year, output at a price of one shilling and three pence per proof gallon. By the start of World War I, production had risen to per annum, but came to a halt in 1917 due to a lack of economic supply of grain. Almost converted to acetone production for use in munitions, the site resumed production in 1920. Having reached pre-war production levels by 1925, with prohibition in the United States, followed by the 1930s Great Depression, production fell to an all-time low of per annum. Production had barely recovered to similar post-World War I levels by the start of World War II, which again saw production suspended. The site was used initially as a grain store, and latterly as a D Day supplies depot. Just after resumption of production, in 1948 Scotland's first saladin maltings were installed. With rationing ending in the early 1950s, this spurred production to pre-World War I levels again. In the late 1950s the site was expanded to include the adjacent former Edinburgh Corporation Tramways depot, to provide space for new warehouses. In 1967, the Darney quarry at East Woodburn, Northumberland was reopened to allow an extension to the buildings in the original stone, and kept open for two years to allow additional offices and brewing facilities to be added. In 1970, of land were purchased at Addiewell, West Lothian to create six racked warehouses and a filling store, added to by an additional three racked warehouses in 1975. That same year an additional adjacent plot was purchased on the opposite (south) side of the A71 road. At this time, expansion of output was enabled by investment in production facilities enabling to be produced in 1979. The late 1970s/early 1980s downturn brought job losses, as production capacity had been planned on a 10% year-on-year increase. After output fell to , the economic revival brought consolidation across Scotch whisky production, and resulted in the 1988 closure of the Caledonian, Edinburgh's other grain distillery. Hence by 1991, output had recovered to . In 1993, shareholders Robertson & Baxter and International Distillers & Vintners formed joint venture company Lothian Distillers, which bought out all other shareholders for an agreed price of ¬£84 Million. After the completion of the replacement of the exploded No.4 still, an expansion plan allowed the production of a grain-neutral spirit to support IDV's Smirnoff vodka brand, and maximum plant capacity to rise to . Rationalisation led to the sale of the maltings and warehouse site on Slateford Road and the Westfield Road warehousing site in 2002 and 2003 respectively. The vast majority of maturation warehousing is at Addiewell where a further four warehouses have been built since 2002, on the site bought in 1975. Current A bonded warehouse in Addiewell for the North British Distillery Lothian Distillers, and hence the sites and production, is jointly owned by Diageo plc and the privately held Edrington Group. Increased sales of Scotch whisky to India, China and South America brought about production of in 2007, produced for: *Diageo subsidiary United Distillers & Vintners: Smirnoff vodka, Johnnie Walker whisky *Edrington: constituent of blended whiskies, including Famous Grouse whisky To enable this, the company imports maize ( per week from France via the Port of Leith), along with a lesser amount of malted barley. The waste output husks are pelletised into cattle-feed, while the liquefied carbon dioxide is sold via contractor Air Products.

Their primary objective is to close coal power plants in the United States, including at least one-third of the country's more than 500 coal plants by 2020, and to replace them with renewable energy sources. The campaign is also active in other countries; for example they are trying to prevent the construction of the Kosovo C thermal power plant near Pristina, Kosovo; to this end they have collaborated with academic and Obama administration climate advisor Dan Kammen. Other objectives include keeping coal in the ground, specifically in Appalachia and the Powder River Basin, where the majority of American coal reserves are located, and preventing coal from being exported from America. The campaign has received at least $80 million from Michael Bloomberg and his philanthropic foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies. During the early Presidency of George W. Bush, an energy task force convened by Dick Cheney advocated the construction of 200 new coal plants in the United States, warning that if they were not built the entire country would face load shedding as California had just seen. During the Bush administration, the Beyond Coal campaign prevented 170 of the 200 plants from being built.  Europe Beyond Coal  In November 2017, a similar campaign, called Europe Beyond Coal, was launched in Europe. This campaign is inspired by the US Beyond Coal campaign but is independent from it. Europe Beyond Coal is an alliance of civil society groups working to catalyse the closures of coal mines and power plants, prevent the building of any new coal projects and hasten the just transition to clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency. Over 30 NGOs, including Greenpeace, WWF, EEB, Climate Action Network Europe and many others, take part in the European campaign.

It emerged in northern Europe, predominantly between 3500 and 2800 BC. It was primarily a product of the Funnelbeaker culture. Between 1964 and 1974, Ewald Schuldt in Mecklenburg- Western Pomerania excavated over 100 sites of different types: simple dolmens, extended dolmens (also called rectangular dolmens), passage graves, great dolmens, unchambered long barrows, and stone cists. In addition, there are polygonal dolmens and types that emerged later, for example, the Grabkiste and R√∂se. This nomenclature, which specifically derives from the German, is not used in Scandinavia where these sites are categorised by other, more general, terms, as dolmens (Dysser, D√∂ser), passage graves (Ganggrifter, J√¶ttestuen) and stone cists (Hellekister, H√§llkista). Neolithic monuments are a feature of the culture and ideology of Neolithic communities. Their appearance and function serves as an indicator of their social development.J. M√ºller In: Varia neolithica VI 2009 p. 15 Nordic megalith architecture and other artificial structures  Elements  Schuldt divided the architectural elements into: * Chamber structure (Kammeraufbau) ‚Äì wall and roof design * Wall infill (Zwischenmauerwerk) * Entrance and threshold stone (Zugang und Schwellenstein) * Chamber flooring (Kammerdielen) * Chamber layout (Kammereinrichtung) * Mound, enclosure and guardian stones (H√ºgel, Einfassung und W√§chtersteine)  Chamber design  Schematic design Graph showing the dimensions of the different types of megalithic structure Corbel (√úberlieger) Enclosure variations  Design variations  There is a considerable difference in chamber design between sites where the capstones are exclusively supported at three points and those where one or more capstones are supported at two points (forming a trilithon). The glacial erratics selected for the walls and roofs, in addition to being the right size, had at least one relatively flat side. Sometimes these were made by splitting a stone, probably by means of heating and quenching. At the narrow end of great dolmens, slabs made of red sandstone were also used, instead of erratics, for walls and infill sections, usually filling in gaps between the supporting stones or orthostats. The orthostats, which were only dug into the ground a little way in the phase after the simple dolmens, were given the necessary purchase on the ground by basal slabs (Standplatten) and stone wedges (Keilsteine). By slighting tilting them towards the interior and packing them on the outside with compressed clay or stones, the orthostats of the trilithons were given greater stability, whilst the supporting stones at places with three-point supported capstones were essentially placed vertically.  Corbelling  In Denmark, several sites have corbels (√úberlieger), usually doubled, supporting the capstones. In one of the sites at Neu Gaarz and Lancken-Granitz in Mecklenburg it is partially double-corbelled. The R√¶veh√∏j of Dalby on the Danish island of Zealand has a three- to four-corbel design, where the inside height of the otherwise less than 1.75 metre high chamber reaches over 2.5 m in height. In Liepen (Mecklenburg) and at several other places it is corbelled in the area of the roughly 0.5 m projecting corbel block.  Capstones  The finished capstones rarely have a weight exceeding 20 tons. By contrast in the rest of the megalithic region, weights of over 100 tons occur (e.g. the Browneshill Dolmen in County Carlow in Ireland and the Dolmen de la Pierre Folle (150 tons) near Montguyon in the Charente in France).  Floor plan  The floor plan of chambers is rarely square, but may be slightly oval, polygonal, rectangular (also bulging), diamond-shaped or trapezoidal.  Infill  Whilst the sidestones at many smaller sites stand close together, the infilled gaps (Zwischenmauerwerk) between orthostats of great dolmens and passage graves are more than one metre wide. On Zealand the chamber of a passage grave on Dysselodden is quite the reverse. Here, the orthostats, which are above the height of a man, are so precisely matched that a sheet of paper cannot be inserted in the cracks between them.  Entrances = Flooring, underfloor area  Floor coverings were obligatory in all chambers and were usually separated by the threshold stone (Schwellenstein) from the, usually uncobbled, entrance passage. The ante-chamber of great dolmens was usually left bare. In several cases the passages were also covered. In these cases, the original chamber was sometimes enhanced by a second threshold stone nearer the entrance. The floor material varies tremendously from placed to place, but often consists of carefully laid cobbles over which a coat of clay was applied. In addition to red sandstone, in the form of grus and slabs, flint, flint grus, clay alone, gravel, or gneiss and slate slabs were occasionally used. Sites also occur where pieces of broken pottery or combinations of several materials are used. The thickness of the floor covering varies from three to ten centimetres. The floor at Sassen, Germany in Mecklenburg is unique. Here, thin red sandstone slabs have been placed vertically and not covered with a clay layer. The flooring apparently formed the final stage of building. How important floor coverings were, is demonstrated by the fact that subsequent users neither removed nor replaced them, nor did they cover them with a further layer. Floor coverings were especially in Mecklenburg- Vorpommern and Sweden also divided into sections (Quartiere).  Rooms or sections = Use of fire  According to E. Schuldt, the chambers were thoroughly cleaned when they were removed and fire was kindled in them. Singular fire and scorch marks on the bones indicate, however, that fires were burned during the successive occupation of these structures and not just in the process of their consecration or removal. 17 of the 106 sites investigated by Schuldt had glowing red floors.  Mound and enclosure  Length of the enclosures in Schleswig-Holstein The Neolithic mound over the megalithic site was usually made of earth. Its material always came from the immediate neighbourhood and was often interspersed with stones. Pebble mounds (Rollsteinhugel) are those covered with a layer of pebbles. Such coverage was detected in Mecklenburg at about 50% of the sites studied, a few (Serrahn (Kuchelmi√ü) and Wilsen) still have their complete pebble layer. In Cuxhaven county, there are megalithic sites covered by peat that have come to light today thanks to the lowering of the water table. These megaliths have no mound covering them. They are considered by some researchers as evidence that not all megalithic chambers were covered over. At these sites, however, it is unclear whether the mound fell a victim to erosion very soon after it had been made. The long rectangular enclosure of the mound, with more or less large boundary stones, is widespread in Nordic megalith architecture. It is called a stone enclosure in English, a Huenenbett (\\"giant's bed\\") in German and a hunebed in Dutch. There are also circular, D-shaped (L√ºbeck-Blankensee, Gowens/Pl√∂n) and trapezoidal enclosures, of which 17 (with five different types of chambers) have been excavated in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The geometry of the enclosure is independent of the type or shape of the chamber that they surround. The dolmens or passage graves lying within stone enclosures may be rectangular, trapezoidal or somewhat oval in shape. The chambers in the enclosures can be oriented longitudinally (mostly in enclosures with simple dolmens) or transversely (transverse chambers - mostly in megaliths with passages) within the mounds. One example is the megaliths of Grundoldendorf, in the municipality of Apensen, in the county of Stade. There are also cases where several dolmens and passage graves lie within one enclosure (Ellested on Fyn (5), Waabs at Eckernf√∂rde (3). There are also different types of chamber in the same enclosure. In Idstedt a chamber was found in a round mound of 10 m diameter, which in turn was the starting point for the expansion of the megalith into an enclosure, only traces of which were left, however.  Dimensions  The enclosures can surrounded the actual mound very closely on all sides or, for example, can be 168 metres long and 4‚Äì5 metres wide surrounding a small simple dolmen (Lindeskov on Funen). Lindeskov is the second longest stone enclosure in Denmark (after the Kardyb Dysse between Tastum and Kobberup - 185 metres long). These extraordinary lengths occur as early as the pre-megalithic monuments of the Funnelbeaker culture. For example, one of the sites (No. 86) at B≈ôezno (German: Briesen) in North Bohemian Louny (German: Laun) a system of the \\"Nied≈∫wied≈∫ type\\" (NTT), at least 143.5 m long, even though the exact location of one end of it is indeterminable. For comparison, the longest German barrow is located in the Sachsenwald forest in Schleswig-Holstein and measures 154 metres long.Often a barrow in Albersdorf, Holstein, is cited as the longest in Germany, at 160 metres. This is based on a typographical error in Ernst Sprockhoff's Atlas of Megalithic Germany - Schleswig-Hostein. The barrow is actually only 60 metres long, and is recorded as such in the State Register as LA53. The Visbeker Braut (\\"bride of Visbeck\\") is 104 metres long, the longest barrow in Lower Saxony. In Poland, the longest enclosure is an unchambered long barrow (kammerloses H√ºnenbett), 130 metres long. A 125-metre-long enclosure, also for an enclosure without a chamber is the longest in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Only 47 metres long, is the one at Steinfeld, the longest in Saxony-Anhalt. Westphalian gallery graves also classified as belonging to the Northern Megalithic Architecture, because they were also built by members of the Funnelbeaker culture, and are even shorter (maximum 35 metres). Sites with a single round enclosure for dolmens (Runddysse sacrifice stone, Posk√¶r Stenhus or Runddysse of Vielsted) are smaller and rarely reach 20 metres in diameter.

Biography Born in Canada, Van Valkenburg moved with her family to Denmark, Iowa at age 17. She moved to Illinois in 1850 to study at Knox College. After transferring to Oberlin College in 1852, she tutored students in elocution and helped found a literary society. She graduated with honors in 1853 and married Charles Burlingame Waite the next year. They had eight children. She was a graduate of the Union College of Law and a member of the Illinois bar. She made a practice of donating legal services to women who could not afford lawyers. In 1859, after moving to Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood, she established the Hyde Park Seminary for young women. The Waite family relocated to the Great Salt Lake Valley in 1862 after her husband Charles was appointed as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Utah Territory by President Lincoln. There, the family was threatened by Mormons with violence after Congress passed laws against polygamy. Waite was the only non-Mormon in town and learned how to use a six- shooter. After finding the laws could not be enforced, Charles resigned his position and the family left the area. They were living in Idaho City when their first son was born. She headed the publishing firm of C. V. Waite and Co., and wrote The Mormon Prophet and His Harem, based on what she had learned of the cruelties inflicted upon Mormon women under the leadership of Brigham Young. The Waites moved back to Chicago in 1866. Waite, along with Mary Livermore and others, formed Chicago Sorosis in 1868, one of the United States' first women's clubs to promote women's welfare. Along with Charles, Waite helped found the Illinois Woman Suffrage Association in 1869. Two years later, as part of a national effort by suffragists to test the newly adopted Fifteenth Amendment, she appeared at the polls to vote and was turned away. Charles, a lawyer, tried to overturn the refusal to permit her to vote with a court action, but was ultimately denied. In 1874, she began a decade of editing the Crusader, a temperance paper. She enrolled in the Union College of Law, the joint law department of the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, in 1885 at the age of 56. In 1886, she founded the Chicago Law Times, a quarterly magazine which she edited. At the International Council of Women at Washington, she was elected president of the Woman's International Bar Association, 26 March 1888. Along with a number of other Chicago women leaders, Waite was involved in the planning of the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. She was a founding member of the Queen Isabella Association. Waite lived in Colorado during her later years, continuing to write and practice law. She died of heart disease of 9 November 1913 while visiting her daughter Lucy's home in Park Ridge, Illinois. Her cremated remains were interred at Chicago's Graceland Cemetery.

He was an education reformer, and both at Oundle, and previously at Dulwich College where he had started as assistant master, he introduced innovative programs of education in engineering. Under his headmastership, Oundle saw a reversal of a decline from which it had been suffering in the middle of the 19th century, with school enrolment rising from 92 at the time of his appointment to 500 when he died. Sanderson was the inspiration for the progressive headmaster character in H. G. Wells' novel Joan and Peter. Wells had sent his own sons to Oundle, and was friendly with Sanderson. After Sanderson's death, which occurred shortly after delivering an address to Wells and others, Wells initially worked on his official biography, entitled Sanderson of Oundle, but later abandoned it in favour of an unofficial biography, The Story of a Great Schoolmaster.  Background, family, and education  Sanderson was born on 13 May 1857, the youngest son of Thomas Sanderson (of Brancepeth) who worked on the estate of Viscount Boyne (Baron Brancepeth), and Margaret Andrews. He attended the village school at Brancepeth, and was later a pupil teacher at the national school in nearby Tudhoe. Starting in 1876, he attended Hatfield Hall in Durham University, where he was the Van Mildert Theological Scholar, received a first-class BA in mathematics and physical science in 1877, and in 1881 was elected a university fellow. In the meantime, he had won an open mathematical scholarship to Christ's College, Cambridge, to which he was admitted on 1878-12-05 and where in 1882 he received a B.A. bracketed the 11th wrangler. Until 1885, the year he received his MA at Cambridge, he was a lecturer at Girton College. He married Jane Hodgson (of Broughton Hall, Cumberland) in 1885, and they had two sons and one daughter: Roy Broughton (1889‚Äì1918, killed in France), Thomas Stuart (born 1890) who became a barrister, and Mary Dorothea (born 1897). From 1893, she ran the boarding house for Oundle School's preparatory department.  Dulwich College  Sanderson's earliest ventures into educational reform began in 1885, when the Master of Dulwich College, the Reverend James Edward Cowell Welldon, invited him to come to the school and be an assistant master teaching physics. Welldon himself had been appointed some two years before, on 1883-03-12, and his appointment of Sanderson developed from the work of a special committee, including Welldon, which had met on 1884-06-11. One of the things that the committee had discussed was a perceived lack of teaching facilities at the college for practical mechanics, a subject that had been raised the year before in the February edition of the College magazine, The Alleynian. Both the master and the board of governors were in favour of such expansion, and on 1885-05-01, Welldon formally invited Sanderson to take up the post of physics master, at an annual salary of . Sanderson historian Richard J. Palmer observes that it is \\"indicative of the importance of the post\\" that the only master at the college who was paid a higher salary than Sanderson's starting salary was C. Bryans, the Senior French Master. The next year, 1886, Sanderson's program of change had begun. He established an engineering side to the curriculum, that included physics, mathematics, workshop practice, and mechanical drawing. This reform and reorganisation was particularly notable for its practical, hands-on approach: boys didn't use models or drawings, but rather worked with and experimented upon actual working engines, dynamos, and other machines. The engineering laboratory had a working steam engine, for example.  Oundle School  Dulwich was far from the only school in the middle-to-late 19th century that was feeling the pressure to modernise and to expand its curriculum to include engineering and the sciences. Such pressure was widely felt by many schools. One such was Oundle School, whose failure to keep up with the times had led it into a period of decline. So in July 1892, the Oundle Court of the Grocer's Company, the governing body of the school, appointed Sanderson as the new headmaster.  Initial reception  Sanderson's initial few years at Oundle were difficult ones. He faced stiff opposition to his reforms from staff, boys, and townspeople. Partly this was because of his background. He didn't have holy orders, hadn't attended a public school, wasn't particularly athletic, spoke with a strong Durham accent, and had a violent temper. The lack of holy orders, whilst insisting upon leading religious services at the school, raised questions of his religious orthodoxy. Because of the lack of a public school education, people held that he didn't have experience of what boarding school education was about. Of the lack of an athletic record, one of the biographers wrote in the official school biography: He also wasn't well served by the fact that he wasn't very good at communicating his ideas, and it took a long time for him to convey to people what he was planning and aiming to achieve. \\"It is possible he would have found his earlier years at Oundle easier if he had been more articulate.\\" opined one of the masters. The school magazine, The Old Oundelian, said of him that to him words were \\"an obdurate medium to the end\\". However, Sanderson appointed new assistant masters who shared his views, and ousted those masters that he had inherited from his predecessor who did not, such that after some seven years only three of the latter remained. (The dismissal of the Reverend Richard Edmonds Jones, the school chaplain, led to back and forth on the letters pages of the Journal of Education when Edmonds Jones wrote a letter of complaint about how he had been treated by Sanderson. The Journal editors decided to refuse all further correspondence on the subject in October 1899.)  Building program  Sanderson's vision for the future of schools can be seen from an address that he delivered at the University of Leeds: This vision can be compared to the building program that Sanderson undertook at Oundle over the years, which comprised the construction of laboratories, workshops, metalwork and woodwork shops, a forge, a foundry, botanical gardens, a meteorological station, an experimental farm, a drawing office, an observatory, and a library. The observatory was constructed the year before Sanderson died, 1921, on a school playing field, the Home Close, near to the centre of Oundle town, to house a Cooke refracting telescope that had been presented to the school by W. T. Carr MP, an old boy of the school. The museum was intended to be a \\"Temple of Vision\\", containing exhibits that illustrated the progress of humanity, and diagrams and charts of history. Its construction was funded by Sir Alfred Fernandez Yarrow, who like Sanderson had lost a son (Eric Yarrow, an Oundelian) in World War 1. The project wasn't completed at the time of Sanderson's death, and he wavered somewhat on the name, sometimes referring to his idea as a \\"Tent of Meeting\\" or a \\"House of Vision\\". It's nowadays The Yarrow Building.  Curriculum reform  In addition to the extensive building programme, Sanderson completely reformed Oundle's curriculum. He introduced wholly new subjects including biochemistry and agriculture, and restructured the school into Classical, Modern Languages, Engineering, and Science sides. The latter two attracted boys to the school who would not have been interested in a strictly classical education. He also widened the scope of the teaching of the humanities, geography and history, to a degree unusual for the time. In the workshops, boys undertook a range of practical projects. During World War 1 they made parts for munitions, and in 1905 a reversing engine for a 4000 horsepower marine engine. Workshop projects were organised as group work, and in the style of an industrial factory: individual tasks were allotted to individual boys, but what they produced had then to be integrated with the output of others. A similar approach was adopted for non-engineering subjects, such as history and literature. An whole form would be subdivided into groups, each responsible for studying one aspect of a particular subject, whose collective work would be combined to form an overall result. Pupils were encouraged to be \\"Dalton-like\\", and to pursue original research of their own. The senior boys also took part in what were called \\"conversaziones\\": presentations to their peers (and others) of practical experiments in the sciences, categorised into physics plus mechanics, chemistry, biology, or workshop. These took place in the spring term, and boys who participated were allowed four or five days off all other work immediately before Speech Day, for work on their presentations, although at any other time work was expected to be done outwith school hours. Other innovations included the boys of the school, each year, producing one of the plays of Shakespeare, and, in the winter term, an oratorio involving all of the boys of the school. More than one boy was cast for each part in the play, to provide a share in the experience for each boy. In the teaching of English, Sanderson preferred to employ the works of John Ruskin, or any other such \\"uncharted\\" author, over Shakespeare; on the grounds that annotated copies of the works of such authors, providing ready-made opinions to be regurgitated for examinations, were not available, and therefore boys had to form their own opinions. He favoured Ruskin in particular because his opinions were controversial, and thus potentially stimulating. Sanderson's encouragement of engineering and practical work greatly influenced, amongst others, the young Joseph Needham. In a 1973 interview, Needham recalled Sanderson thus:  Educational ethos  Sanderson's aforementioned address to the University of Leeds also encompassed his vision of the ways that education should occur, continuing as it does: Sanderson's views on education were very similar to Wells', and Sanderson's reform programme was a practical instance of the progressive, science-based, co√∂perative, and systematic reformism that Wells himself also advocated. Both Sanderson and Wells believed that education should be a synthesis of the arts, humanities, and sciences; geared towards the individual aptitudes and interests of each pupil; and applied and technical in addition to theoretical and experimental. Wells also influenced Sanderson to include the teaching of Russian in the curriculum. Sanderson regarded schools as altruistic institutions, which should encourage co√∂peration rather than competition, and regarded them as microcosms of the world that they exist in. In the address to the University of Leeds, he argued that it was more important \\"for the effective growth of the nation\\" to \\"rescue the submerged, and raise the average\\" ‚Äì in other words to ensure that the weak are not pushed out of education and to increase the average educational level of all pupils ‚Äì than to focus exclusively upon enabling the progress of \\"men of ability\\". On the subject of co√∂peration over competition, he asserted that \\"the two are not of the same order of dimensions\\", and that the stimulation to be obtained by a pupil from the former was far greater than the stimulation from the latter. He also maintained that boys learned best by doing, and that all school work should be, at least in some sense, creative. Sanderson spoke and wrote on his ideas for education reform. In addition to writing , , and the preface to , he was a member of the 1916 Committee on the Neglect of Science, a lobbyist group of prominent scientists that had been formed after a letter written to The Times claiming that Britain's failure in World War One to that point had in part been to the neglect of \\"physical science\\" teaching in public schools in favour of the classics. The committee published a book in 1918, to which Sanderson contributed . He also addressed the May 1919 conference of the League for the Promotion of Science in Education, the successor to the 1916 Neglect of Science committee, and in 1917 was a member of a committee of the British Association (alongside Henry Edward Armstrong) that had been charged with reporting on the state of science education in British schools.  Death and posthumous biographies  Sanderson collapsed and died of a heart attack on 15 June 1922 at a meeting of the National Union of Scientific Workers (with Wells as the chairman) in the old Botanical Theatre, University College, London, to whom he had just given an address entitled \\"The duty and service of science in the new era\\". Sanderson had been the inspiration for the character of Henderson, the progressive headmaster of the fictional Caxton School in Wells' novel Joan and Peter. After Sanderson died, Wells was initially involved in the official biography of Sanderson, entitled Sanderson of Oundle and co-authored by over fifty staff of the school, whose proceeds were to go to the school. However, Sanderson's widow objected to the way that Wells portrayed her husband, and Wells left the project in favour of writing his own biography, The Story of a Great Schoolmaster. It was published in 1923 by the same periodicals that had serialised Joan and Peter, The New Leader and The New Republic, and published in book form in 1924. It is also in volume 24 of the Atlantic Edition of the Works of H.G. Wells, immediately following the second part of Joan and Peter, where, incidentally, the character name of the fictional headmaster changed from Henderson to Westinghouse. In the biography, Wells wrote: Wells's biography and the school-staff-written biography portray Sanderson differently: Wells (who deplored the neglect of the Temple of Vision after Sanderson's death) concentrated upon Sanderson's ideals, whereas the staff concentrated upon Sanderson's actual work at the school. The contrast between the two accounts of Sanderson was described by William George Walker, in his 1956 history of the school, thus: In 2002 Richard Dawkins, an old boy of the school, was invited to the school to present the first in what was to be a series of annual Oundle Lectures. Michael Downes, a modern language teacher at the school and the school's recently appointed Sanderson Fellow, suggested to Dawkins that he use Sanderson as the subject of his lecture. Dawkins did so, and just over a week later, wrote an article for The Guardian based upon his lecture , which he then included as a chapter in his book A Devil's Chaplain. Historian A. N. Wilson called it a \\"joyous essay\\" in which Dawkins quoted \\"quite extensively\\" from the sermons that Sanderson had given in the school's chapel. Wilson noted that Dawkins' account, whilst focussing upon Sanderson's inspirational qualities with respect to science and engineering, that Wilson likened to Dawkins' own, had stripped from the quotations (as compared to the texts of those sermons to be found in the 1923 official biography) any mention of religion, despite Sanderson's background in theology. Wilson observed that \\"some would consider it dishonest\\" of Dawkins to have omitted this, since from Dawkins' nonetheless laudatory and moving biography the reader would not have learned that Sanderson was a religious man. Mark T. Coppenger, professor of Christian Apologetics at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, was one person who did in fact consider it so, saying that Dawkins' biography of Sanderson, which he too described as one that lauded Sanderson, was, in its omissions, \\"dishonest but understandable\\". Dawkins is one of several recent commentators who have compared Sanderson to, or put him in the place of, modern headmasters. He observed that today Sanderson would have been headmaster of \\"a large, mixed comprehensive\\" and would have been \\"contemptuous of the pussyfooting, lawyer-driven fastidiousness of Health and Safety, and the accountant-driven league-tables that dominate modern education and actively encourage schools to put their own interests before those of their pupils\\". David E. Hellawell, professor of Education Management at the University of Central England observed that the headmaster-as-autocrat attitude, related in one history of Oundle School by the statement that Sanderson's masters were required to \\"see eye to eye with him; if they did not they must go\\", would land a modern British headmaster in the local newspaper, and possibly in jail. Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy, in his 1979 book The Public School Phenomenon, praised Sanderson even though he was highly critical of public school education in general.  Legacy and commemoration  Few of the headmasters during the inter-war period adopted Sanderson's ideas. Wells was particularly critical of Dr Kenneth Fisher, Sanderson's immediate successor at Oundle, for not maintaining the spirit of Sanderson's reformist programme. The third Hadow Report didn't mention Sanderson by name, but several of his ideas are identifiable therein. Sanderson House, one of the boarding houses of Oundle School (now and since 2000 a girls' boarding house, after the school began to admit both sexes), is named after Sanderson and was constructed in 1938. From 1992 to 2002, a Sanderson Trust funded the appointment of a fellow at the school whose task was to further \\"in every possible way the opportunities open to Oundelians to understand the importance of industry to the prosperity of the nation\\". The position of Sanderson Fellow survives, although the funding trust no longer exists. A bust of Sanderson, by Edward Lacey, once stood in the livery hall of the Grocers' Company. However, in the fire of 22 September 1965 it was completely melted. The original cast was still available, and another bust was made, that stood in the Piper Room until that room's refurbishment in 2001, when the bust was moved elsewhere.

Dick Award. The series follows the adventures of two Victorian-era protagonists based on two historical figures, Richard Francis Burton and Algernon Charles Swinburne, in mid-late 19th Century London. The series is framed as an alternate history, and takes place in actual locations such as the Cannibal Club and London's East End, involving many notable personalities of the era, such as Florence Nightingale, Charles Darwin, and explorer John Hanning Speke. It includes actual historical events, namely the Spring-heeled Jack case, the assassination attempt on Queen Victoria in 1840,[Hibbert, pp. 421‚Äì422; St Aubyn, pp. 160‚Äì161]. the search for the source of the Nile and the development of Darwin's theory of Evolution.  Plot summary A time-traveller from the distant future returns to 1840 to prevent an ancestor from attempting to commit an act of regicide. After failing in his mission, he returns to 1837 and recruits the 'Mad Marquess' to find his ancestor and correct the error. The result of his interference is an altered timeline in which technological advances have given rise to two scientific classes: 'Technologists' and 'Eugenicists' (See Technologies). Sir Richard Francis Burton returns to find his reputation damaged and his second-in- command lionized as the discoverer of the source of the Nile. He is recruited by the Prime Minister, in the capacity of King's Agent, to investigate the Spring-heeled Jack affair and the strange manifestations plaguing London's East End.  Characters  *Richard Francis Burton: adventurer, linguist, orientalist, swordsman, and former Captain in the Royal African Corps. While he and Speke were the first Europeans to view the African Great Lakes, they quarreled over which one was the source of the Nile. Although Burton had headed the expedition, Speke returned to London first and presented his conclusions, which were accepted. Burton was cast into a secondary role and his career as an explorer was tarnished. *Algernon Charles Swinburne: poet and novelist closely associated with the decadent movement of the 19th Century. *Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford: popularly known as the 'Mad Marquess', Henry de la Poer Beresford was a notorious rake of the era, and the central suspect in the Spring-Heeled Jack attacks. *Edward Oxford: would-be assassin of Queen Victoria in 1840.

Personal life and career From 1944 until 1947, she attended Pratt Institute School of Art, where she earned a certificate in advertising graphic design and illustration. She married Edward Bottini in 1951. She was employed for sixteen years at the east coast daily newspaper Newsday, until her move to Los Angeles in 1971. Bottini realized she had same sex attractions at an early age. Her first crush was on her first grade female gym teacher. During an interview with the Lavender Effect, Bottini admitted to falling \\"in love with every gym teacher I ever had in my life.\\" She also formed a close, platonic relationship with one of her seventh grade teachers, whom became a parental figure for her. Despite her attraction to women, Bottini did not pursue lesbian relationships, due to cultural norms of the time. She was engaged to several men, with each engagement lasting only a few weeks before she'd end the relationship. She married her husband of sixteen years, Eddie, on January 12, 1952. Leading up to the marriage, Bottini began experiencing physical symptoms involving her ability to swallow food properly. Her doctor realized her symptoms were related to anxiety and referred her to a psychiatrist. She expressed to the psychiatrist that she felt attracted to women, but the psychiatrist told her she was not homosexual. He suggested she abandon her friends and interests and \\"cleave\\" to soon to be husband, Eddie. She did as her psychiatrist instructed, but her lesbian desires did not subside. Years later, a coworker, Delores Alexander, introduced Bottini to the National Organization for Women (NOW). Alexander had just interviewed the NOW president Betty Friedan, and felt it would be a useful organization for Bottini to join. Bottini helped found the New York chapter of NOW in 1966. Soon after becoming president of the New York chapter of NOW in 1968 she came out as a lesbian. She left her husband and moved in with a woman in New York City. She also studied acting at Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute and performed a one-woman show, \\"The Many Faces of Women\\", nationwide. Bottini now works as a graphic artist. Her memoir, The Liberation of Ivy Bottini: A Memoir of Love and Activism, as told to Judith V. Branzburg, was published by Bedazzled Ink Publishing Company in November, 2018.  Activism  In 1966, she helped found the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women. In 1968, she was elected the president of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women; she came out as a lesbian later that year. In 1969, she designed the logo for the National Organization for Women which is still their logo today. Also in 1969, she held a public forum titled \\"Is Lesbianism a Feminist Issue?\\", which was the first time lesbian concerns were introduced into the National Organization for Women. In 1970, she led a demonstration at the Statue of Liberty where she and others from the National Organization for Women's New York chapter draped an enormous banner over a railing which read \\"WOMEN OF THE WORLD UNITE!\\" During her time at the National Organization for Women's New York chapter she also introduced feminist consciousness raising, which was later adapted for all chapters in the organization to participate in. However, later in 1970 Betty Friedan engineered the expulsion of lesbians from the National Organization for Women's New York chapter, including Ivy Bottini.Vicki Lynn Eaklor Queer America: a GLBT history of the 20th century, ABC-CLIO, 2008 p. 145 While Kate Millett was speaking about sexual liberation at Columbia University in 1970, a woman in the audience asked her, \\"Why don't you say you're a lesbian, here, openly. You've said you were a lesbian in the past.\\" Millett hesitantly responded, \\"Yes, I am a lesbian\\". A couple of weeks later, Time December 8, 1970 article \\"Women's Lib: A Second Look\\" reported that Millett admitted she was bisexual, which it said would likely discredit her as a spokesperson for the feminist movement because it \\"reinforce[d] the views of those skeptics who routinely dismiss all liberationists as lesbians.\\" In response, two days later a press conference was organized by Bottini and Barbara Love in Greenwich Village which led to a statement in the name of 30 lesbian and feminist leaders which declared their \\"solidarity with the struggle of homosexuals to attain their liberation in a sexist society\\". She moved to Los Angeles in 1971. There she founded AIDS Network LA, the first AIDS organization in Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles Lesbian/Gay Police Advisory Board. In 1977, she created and hosted the first Lesbian/Gay radio show on a mainstream network (KHJ in Los Angeles.) In 1978, she was the Southern California deputy director of the successful campaign against the Briggs Initiative (No on 6), which would have banned gays and lesbians from teaching in California's public schools. She later chaired the successful No on LaRouche and No on 64 Initiative campaign. The Larouche initiative (Number 64), which was not passed, might have quarantined people with AIDS. In 1981 she was appointed by then-governor Jerry Brown as Commissioner for \\"California Commission on Aging\\", making her the first \\"out\\" lesbian or gay person to be appointed to a state board or commission. In 1983 she co-founded AIDS Project Los Angeles. In 1993, she co-founded the nonprofit organization Gay & Lesbian Elder Housing, which in 2007 developed Triangle Square, the first affordable housing complex for gay and lesbian senior citizens in the country. From 1998 until 1999, she co-chaired the addiction and recovery city task force, and established the ad hoc committee City of West Hollywood, to publicize the issue of lesbian and gay partner abuse. Also in 1999, she chaired the National Organization for Women's annual national conference, called Pioneer Reunion, in Beverly Hills. Shortly after, she co-chaired the Lesbian and Gay Advisory Board for the City of West Hollywood from 2000 to 2010. In 2001, she was part of a lesbian and gay rights coalition that formed the Alliance for Diverse Community Aging Services to help lesbian and gay seniors obtain assisted living and affordable retirement. In 2011, she designed t-shirts for the Dyke March in Los Angeles. She and The Lavender Effect, an LGBT history organization, are currently advocating for a LGBT museum in Los Angeles. She is also advocating for the creation of an AIDS memorial in West Hollywood. Her papers and certain audio recordings are held by ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives. In 2009, the film On These Shoulders We Stand profiled Ivy Bottini as well as ten other LGBT activists from the early LGBT rights movement in Los Angeles. She participated in an Oral History project by The Lavender Effect, which documented her personal life and work as an activist.  Awards  In 1991, she received Drama Logues' \\"Best Performance Award\\" for Against the Rising Sea. In 1998, the Ivy Theater was established in her honor in West Hollywood. In 2001, in the Matthew Shepard Memorial Triangle a tree was planted in her honor, and a plaque placed at the foot of it. In 2007, she received the Morris Kight Lifetime Achievement Award from Christopher Street West Los Angeles LGBT Pride.

Initially located on Dryades Street, it moved in 1904 to Simon Bolivar Avenue, where it continues in business as the city's largest and best-known maker of po'boy bread, a fiercely competitive niche. Leidenheimer bought out its largest competitor, Reising's Sunrise, in the early 1990s, and still manufactures products under the Reising name. It bought another competitor, Angelo Gendusa, in the 2000s. The bakery was forced to close for a short time after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

It began in 1987 when members of the surrounding community put forth their efforts to save a 2,000-year-old redwood named ‚ÄúBig Red‚Äù. It currently provides lifelong preservation to more than 10,000 acres of forest, rivers and wildlife corridors in California, while improving the relationship between its communities and their environment.  History  Sanctuary Forest began in 1987 within the temperate rainforest of the headwaters of the Mattole River on the northern California coast. Active community members with the vision to save the 2,000-year-old redwood, ‚ÄúBig Red‚Äù, that was scheduled for cutting by industrial timberland owners, launched Sanctuary Forest‚Äôs first campaign. The origin of this organization is based on the beliefs of the Redwoods Monastery, a group of Cistercian monastic women, who educated their communities on the severe threats logging has towards the environment. Conservation efforts Its conservation efforts are to preserve old growth Douglas firs, redwood forests, wildlife corridors, and many other priceless habitats and streamflows in and around the Mattole River. It has guided efforts to save 1,200 acres of old growth forest, 4,440 acres of land for conservation purposes, and 6,075 acres of conservation easements on private property. Programs Sanctuary Forest‚Äôs programs include: Lands Conservation Program, Stewardship Program, Education and Outreach Program and Collaboration Program:  Lands conservation program  The Lands Conservation Program protects the main areas that help keep the Mattole River healthy through conservation easements and land acquisition.  Stewardship program  The Stewardship Program establishes ecologically sound land management by restoration, water conservation and other projects.  Education and outreach program  The Education and Outreach Program promotes public appreciation for the land by providing summer hikes and scholarships.  Collaboration program  Collaboration Program unify different perspectives with the same purpose of keeping the Mattole watershed healthy, through making partnerships to promote conservation and responsible management of the environment. It includes the Upper Mattole River and Forest Cooperative (UMRFC), which involves public, private, federal, state and nonprofit organizations that manage 4,000 acres of Mattole River headwaters as part of a threatened salmon location. Sanctuary Forest is the nonprofit land conservation group that was active in conserving this area in collaboration with the UMRFC.

Claudio Abbado agreed to become Artistic Director of the orchestra and recruit its members. Giuseppe Modugno was designed from beginning as Artistic Secretary. The orchestra gave its first concert on November 4, 2004 in Bologna's Auditorium Manzoni. The orchestra performs in many major Italian cities and in Vienna's Musikverein where it is in residence. The orchestra tours Europe and is regularly invited to the Salzburg Festival. The Orchestra Mozart cooperated with different theatres and musical institution in Europe, as well as in Asia.

However, the number of musicians sometimes exceed this format: in its June 2012 concerts, for example, the orchestra played Ludwig van Beethoven's Egmont Overture and Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto and Second Symphony with 14 first violins, 12 second violins, 10 violas, 8 cellos and 5 double-basses (typical numbers in a symphony orchestra being 16 first violins, 14 second violins, 12 violas, 10 cellos and 8 double-basses). The orchestra acts as a meeting-place for young musicians from many countries, partly selected through the Orchestra Mozart Academy within the Philharmonic Academy, and experienced musicians. The latter have included violinist Giuliano Carmignola, violists Wolfram Christ and Diemut Poppen, double-bass player Alois Posch, oboist Lucas Macias Navarro, flautist Jacques Zoon, horn player Alessio Allegrini. Diego Matheuz is Principal Guest Conductor of the Orchestra Mozart.  Recordings  The orchestra conducted by Claudio Abbado is featured on several Deutsche Grammophon CDs, mainly of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart compositions. Deutsche Grammophon released Abbado's first recordings with the orchestra on its period imprint Archiv, despite the use of modern instruments; the later albums have been released under the yellow label.

Through the use of art Salgado has become a well-known activist within the DREAM Act movement. Salgado uses his art to empower undocumented and queer people by telling their story and putting a human face to the issue. He has worked on various art projects that address anti-immigrant discourse, the issues of what it means to be undocumented, and what it means to be undocu-queer. One of his more well-known projects is a series of satire images addressing American Apparel‚Äôs use of a farm worker in one of their ads in the summer of 2011.Channing, Kennedy. Undocumented Artist Gives American Apparel‚Äôs Farmer Ad a Political Twist . ColorLines. June 1, 2012 Early life and education Julio Salgado was born on September 1, 1983 in Ensenada, Mexico. When Salgado‚Äôs younger sister was diagnosed with a life threatening kidney disease in 1995, Salgado and his family emigrated to the United States. After being advised by the doctor that a return to Mexico would result in his sister's death, Salgado‚Äôs family decided to remain in the United States. The Salgado family overstayed their visas and Salgado was left to live under an undocumented immigrant status in the United States. Salgado attended David Starr Jordan High School in Long Beach, California and graduated from the class of 2001. Because Salgado was an undocumented student, he did not qualify for federal financial aid. After high school Salgado took on various low-paying jobs in order to pay his way through college. In 2010 he obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism from California State University, Long Beach. He began his artistic career as the editorial cartoonist for the Daily 49er newspaper of CSU, Long Beach.San Ramon, Gabriel.

Queer Conversations with \\"UndocuQueer\\" Julio Salgado. De-Bug. March 14, 2012 During his high school and college years, afraid of insults and rejection, he maintained his queer identity hidden and only felt safe revealing his undocumented status since many of those around him faced the same struggle.Rojas, Leslie Berestein.Out of the closet twice: Cartoonist Julio Salgado on coming out as undocumented and gay.Multi-American.December 23.2011 Salgado‚Äôs mother was the first person to know about his queer identity. In the 8th grade, he began documenting intimate sketches and writings in a personal journal, expressing his feelings for other boys. After his mother stumbled upon this journal and read his entries, he had no choice but to confess his queer identity. To Salgado‚Äôs surprise, his mother was very understanding and accepted him regardless.Salgado has made his queer identity and undocumented status public by speaking on the need to humanize both issues. Career In 2010, a group of undocumented students protested in front of the Hart Senate Building in Washington D.C. demanding the passage of the Federal DREAM Act. Julio‚Äôs activist role emerged after coming across the photograph in the Washington Post of Diana Yael Martinez, an undocumented student who was being arrested after refusing to leave the sit-in at the senate building. Abramson,Marc.Pushing for Immigrant Law and Citizen Status. The Washington Post. July 21,2010 His anger with such treatment ignited the illustrations that were later used in the DREAM Act movement. He states, ‚ÄúI channeled all that anger into my sketchpad and I began to draw.‚Äù. Although Julio‚Äôs use of art began as a refuge that saved him from his hardships,David Perry Interviews Julio Salgado.YouTube.com. April 3, 2012 DREAM Act activists soon found themselves using them as weapons for rallies and campaigns. Salgado links his undocumented and queer identity in most of his artwork in order to put a face to the issue. Salgado explains, ‚ÄúIn the past, one could see articles or interviews with a hidden face or an anonymous name. That would dehumanize the issue and by us coming out and saying we‚Äôre undocumented and unafraid, we‚Äôre putting a face to it.\\" As a result, he has worked on multiple projects that give young undocumented and undocumented queers a chance to come out of the shadows and share their experiences.Salgado uses his art as a form of activism. He considers himself an \\"artivist\\".Lopez, Rogelio Alejandro. Interview Highlights: Dreamers Adrift and the \\"I Exist\\" Collection. MIT Center for Civic Media. April 2, 2012 Marita Sturken and Lisa Cartwright state that ‚Äúmany artists have attempted to defy those conventions to break the rules of various systems of representation, and to push at the definitions of representation\\"(2007). Salgado‚Äôs work reflects Sturken and Cartwright‚Äôs concept of system of representation through his strategies of redefining the meaning of being undocumented and queer. Methods Salgado is a self- taught artist who uses marker and paper to draw much of his work. He has also made it known that he draws many of his illustrations with the help of a computer mouse. He uses his personal Facebook account and Tumblr as his mediums to publicize the vast majority of his artwork. Projects=I am Undocu-Queer! Salgado began working on the ‚ÄúI am Undocu-Queer!‚Äù art project in 2012. With this project Salgado, in conjunction with the Queer Undocumented Immigrant Project (QUIP), ‚Äúaims to give ‚Ä¶ undocumented queers more of a presence in the discussion of migrant rights‚Äù.Salgado, Julio. I Exist. Tumblr. February 2012. The illustrations consist of images of actual young undocumented queer people who have chosen to come out of the shadows to define what it means to be both undocumented and queer. The drawings of the young people are accompanied by a quote that states the subject‚Äôs meaning of being undocumented and queer. In an episode of Queer Conversations with the San Jose-based poet Yosimar Reyes, Salgado explained the need to use real undocumented and queer activists in his artwork as a ‚Äúform of documenting the key individuals in the movement‚Äù. UndocuQueer activists have been at the forefront in acts of disobedience that bring attention to the DREAM Act. Undocumented Apparel In May 2012 American Apparel faced criticism due to a magazine ad that was published in the Summer of 2011. The ad features a young white female model linking arms with a dark-skinned Latino farm worker. The ad identifies the models as ‚ÄúRobin a USC student, studying Public Relations, with Raul, a California farmer in Denim and Chambray.‚Äù In an interview with Colorlines Salgado expressed his reaction: ‚ÄúMy first thought was, this is so unrealistic‚Ä¶. what exactly is it that American Apparel is trying to say here? Is it, ‚ÄòSee? There‚Äôs unity? We like you!‚Äô That‚Äôs not how it happens, and American Apparel has always used people, especially women, as objects. Were they just doing this to get on the undocumented wagon?‚Äù Salgado created the ‚ÄúUndocumented Apparel‚Äù series as a reaction to the original ad by drawing real undocumented people that are part of his life. The images of the people are also ‚Äúaccompanied by an acidic quote contrasting their lives to American Apparel‚Äôs upwardly mobile clientele.‚Äù Like much of Salgado‚Äôs previous work, the images turned into a form of homage for the people he knows. Dreamers Adrift In 2010 Salgado along with four friends ‚Äì Jesus I√±iguez, Fernando Romero, and Deisy Hernandez ‚Äì launched the nationwide media project DREAMers Adrift. Salgado and his colleagues‚Äô mission was to create a space for DREAM Act eligible students to tell their stories through the use of narratives, poetry, visual arts, and blogging. The founders‚Äô main purpose is to give young undocumented people the tools to become empowered and to make themselves visible. The stories published in the website are those of young people who are forced to deal with the current immigration system in the United States. DREAMersAdrift features a series of videos titled ‚ÄúUndocumented and Awkward‚Äù that demonstrate through the use of comedy the predicaments in which numerous of undocumented students find themselves in throughout and after college. Salgado states that many of the situations that are acted out throughout the skits are situations that he has personally found himself in. Some of these moments include narratives of running into an old high-school friend while working in housekeeping at a hotel; getting denied entrance to a dance club because Consular Identifications are not seen as valid forms of identification; and also having to come out to other undocumented people as queer.Chen, Michelle. Documenting Undocumented Youth: Behind the Scenes with DREAMers Adrift . Huff Post: Latino Voices. January 4, 2012 ‚ÄúFor My Dreamers‚Äù Salgado dedicates much of his art to the undocumented activists who are in the forefront of the DREAM Act movement. The images include messages in support of the DREAM Act, opposition to anti-immigrant bills, as well as messages of encouragement for undocumented people. Salgado also uses his art in order to raise awareness of deportation cases and the ways that people can take action in order to stop them. Much of his artwork is used in rallies all throughout the United States in support of the DREAM Act. \\"I Exist\\" The ‚ÄúI Exist‚Äù collection specifically addresses the DREAM Act movement. The images in this collection demand the anti-immigrant discourse in mainstream media to humanize the language and treatment aimed towards undocumented youth. Salgado declares: ‚ÄúThe language that anti-immigrant folks have used [aims to]‚Ä¶erase our identities or erase the fact that we exist here. So I wanted with my artwork kind of to say, ‚Äòhey listen, I exist,‚Äô [and] it‚Äôs almost like a scream.\\" The images of students wearing cap and gown emphasizes Salgado‚Äôs message to decriminalizing undocumented students.

The film follows Extreme Tiger, an up-and-coming professional luchador from Tijuana, on a journey that places him in a mask vs. hair match against Joe L√≠der. In addition, he follows other new talent, Angel Negro Jr. and Pancho Cachondo. In the process, the film also interviews other luchadores, promoters, commissioners, families, and fans who discuss the cultural significance of lucha libre as sport, ritual, and spectacle. The film includes music by Carne Cruda, Marziano, White Pine, and Nortec Collective. ¬°Que viva la lucha! premiered at the 30th annual Mill Valley Film Festival on Saturday, Oct. 13, 2007, and has won two awards; at the Latino Film Festival and at the San Francisco International Film Festival.‚Äò‚ÄôUCSC News‚Äô‚Äô, UCSC professor's documentary to premiere at Mill Valley Film Festival, June 5, 2012 Production While reminiscing with old friend Edmundo Soto about his childhood experience with lucha libre in Tijuana, Vazquez and Soto decided undertake this documentary project in order to capture the ritual immersed in the lucha libre culture. Vazquez comments on the production of the documentary stating \\"I shot on video because it allowed for high shooting ration. During the wrestling matches we had three cameras in order to capture the action from multiple angles and to get the viewer closer to the real experience\\". The production spanned two years as it followed emerging Tijuana wrestlers and their dual lives and encountered some obstacles. While filming, Extreme Tiger had acquired appendicitis, which stalled production, but filming in Tijuana did have its advantages due to its more lenient filming and liability regulations. Synopsis The film opens at the Auditorio de Tijuana to scenes of wrestlers and cheering fans. Following these scenes, the film proceeds to break down the concept of lucha libre and its cultural significance by following the dual lives of professional luchadores: Extreme Tiger, Angel Negro Jr., and Pancho Cachondo, all working-class individuals from Tijuana who become local heroes in the community the moment they put on their masks. The film breaks down Tijuana‚Äôs lucha libre components respectively: Los T√©cnicos Books and other works such as Heather Levi‚Äôs The World of Lucha Libre have examined lucha libre as surrounded by universal themes of good versus evil, underdog versus bully, the noble hero outwitting the corrupt nemesis- all themes which play out within Mexican lucha libre. ¬°Que viva la lucha! provides captures the dual lives led by professional wrestlers who represent the good (Los T√©cnicos) versus the evil (Los Rudos) amongst other various themes. The film introduces Extreme Tiger, a local who repairs cars by day, and wrestles as a t√©cnico by night. Within the context of the film, Extreme Tiger is a new star in Tijuana‚Äôs lucha libre who is quickly moving up the ranks, and aspires to take his professional wrestling career abroad to Japan. Ultimately, his journey brings him to a mask versus hair match against his rival, where he risks losing his mask, and more importantly, his career. Extreme Tiger prevails and takes Tijuana wrestling to Japan. The t√©cnicos within lucha libre are characterized as charismatic, righteous, and always seeking justice. Los Rudos ¬°Que viva la lucha! also introduces two rudos, Angel Negro Jr. and Pancho Cachondo. Angel Negro Jr. is a young wrestler, at 16, he has become one of the local favorite rudos while still attending high school. El Pancho Cachondo is also a local wrestler, a rudo whose character was inspired by a former Mexican congressman who was photographed in a thong at a bar/table dance. The role of the rudos in lucha libre serve to represent the corrupt, dishonest evil-doers in society. La M√°scara \\"The mask is one the unique iconographies that distinguishes Mexican wrestling\\". Through the mask, wrestlers are able to construct and transform into a character that contrasts to their working-class identities. The film discusses how the Mexican wrestling mask is associated with ancestral indigenous masking and is representative of Mexican culture and history. Los Exoticos, Los Referis, Las Luchadoras and other participants The film also addresses the incorporation of other participants in addition to the rudos and t√©cnicos in lucha libre. Other participants include women wrestlers, gay wrestlers (Diamantina), midget wrestlers, and wrestling referees. The film captures the interactions between the spectators and wrestlers, such as Diamantina, and the spectator's ambivalent feelings towards these wrestlers. In response to the mixed reactions of Los Exoticos by spectators of Lucha Libre, Vazquez states \\"On the one hand, Lucha Libre means 'free wrestling'. That can loosely translated as 'everything goes'. That‚Äôs a public space in the wrestling arena, where everything goes\\".‚Äò‚ÄôUTS San Diego‚Äô‚Äô, Latino Film Fest, June 5, 2012 Los Fanaticos and Spectators ¬°Que viva la lucha! demonstrates how lucha libre in Tijuana is enjoyed by a vast range of spectators ranging from young children to older generations, and across genders. It is a space where fanatics and spectators are able to actively participate through the cheering, insults, and mixed emotions. The film also interviews extreme fanatics to collect lucha libre memorabilia, and dedicated fans that have gained free access to shows (La Tiburona). In response to the spectatorship of lucha libre, Vazquez states \\"The arenas are considered a free place to let out all anger, excitement, passions\\".‚Äò‚ÄôPajaronian‚Äô‚Äô, Unmasking Mexican wrestling, June 5, 2012 References External links  * 2007 films Professional wrestling documentary films ","title":"Que viva la lucha"},{"id":"36072908","text":"Colynthaea coriacea is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae, the only species in the genus Colynthaea.Bezark, Larry G.

Drivers in merging lanes are expected to use both lanes to advance to the lane reduction point and merge at that location, alternating turns. The late merge method contrasts with the early merge method. A related scheme is the dynamic late merge. The late merge method has not been found to increase throughput (throughput is the number of vehicles that pass through a point in a given period of time). However, it considerably reduces queue (\\"backup\\") length (because drivers use the ending lane until its end) and reduces speed differences between the two lanes, increasing safety. In the case of Interstate 77 in North Carolina, where signs directed people to use the zipper merge, the length of the backup was reduced from eight miles to two. Governments hold campaigns to promote the late merge method because irritation and aggression are common among drivers who are not educated about the benefits of the technique, sometimes including straddling lanes to block late mergers. Often drivers who change lanes too early do not like to see other drivers continue until the end of the drop-away lane, even though this late merging is encouraged by the authorities.The \\"Zipper Merge\\" May Seem Aggressive, But It's Actually A Highway Congestion Reliever In most countries, a driver can be penalized for not using the late merge method, but in some countries only where a traffic sign so indicates. Most states in the United States require merging traffic to yield to through traffic which already exists in the lane they wish to enter. This further complicates the common understanding of proper merging protocol, as even though zipper merging is widely encouraged, those doing so are still legally required to yield, and those who choose not to let them merge are not doing anything wrong from a legal standpoint. Traffic already in the lane being merged into has the right of way over the merging traffic from the lane that will disappear. Three lanes merging into two Zipper Merging (from three to two lanes) often leads to traffic congestion. The \\"zipper merge\\" is a late merge with more than two lanes in right-hand side traffic. The merging of three to two lanes makes a pattern which is more complicated than the one that is made by the merging of two to one lane. In an ideal situation, there actually arise two \\"zippers\\" now: #one out of every two vehicles moves from the middle lane towards the right lane, where after every two vehicles, a gap is sought; #afterwards, two vehicles merge from the left lane to the gap in the middle lane. In case the two left lanes would merge according to the late merge method described before (two to one), the new left lane will have twice as many vehicles as the right lane. A fourth of the number of vehicles on the new left lane will eventually choose the (faster and less occupied) right lane, bringing the number of vehicles in both lanes back to an equal number.

A competitor at the 2012 Summer Olympics, she won a silver medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, a bronze medal at the 2011 World Archery Championships, and was the women's individual recurve champion at the World Field Archery Championships in 2016. Oliver announced her retirement from the British national archery team in 2017. Early and personal life Amy Oliver was born on 10 July 1987 in Mexborough, South Yorkshire. She was first introduced to archery at age seven by her parents, who both practised the sport competitively, but it was not until ten years later that Oliver became more involved, joining an archery club and attending training sessions. Career Oliver won two medals at the European Field Championships in 2007, the second international competition in which she participated. Having achieved a silver medal in the team event, she later won gold medal in the individual event while wearing her silver medal as motivation. In 2011 she partnered with Larry Godfrey to win bronze medal in the mixed team event at the World Archery Championships in Turin. In 2016 Oliver won the women's individual recurve title at the World Field Archery Championship in Dublin, defeating Italy's Jessica Tomasi in the final. She announced her retirement from the British national archery team in 2017. As of 2017 she is a member of the Dearne Valley Archery Club. 2010 Commonwealth Games Oliver participated in the 2010 Commonwealth Games as a member of the England women's recurve archery team. Alongside Naomi Folkard and Alison Williamson she reached the final of the women's team recurve event before losing narrowly to the hosts India. Having shot a low score of six with her final arrow of the match, Oliver criticised the conduct of the home crowd as distracting to her preparations for the shot, saying afterwards \\"I was nervous, the crowd was not good. They were pretty loud and it was not good sportsmanship for archery.\\" The world governing body for archery, FITA, later released a statement asking spectators to observe a sense of fair play. The Telegraph referred to her silver medal as her \\"biggest disappointment\\" in a profile published prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics. 2012 Summer Olympics Oliver made her Olympic debut at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. She qualified for the British Olympic team after topping the final national selection tournament for archers in April 2012, joining Naomi Folkard and Alison Williamson in contesting the women's individual and women's team events. Oliver had a difficult start to the Olympics after suffering technical problems in the preliminary ranking round, entering the elimination rounds of the individual event as the fifty-seventh seed, and combining with Folkard and Williamson to place Great Britain eleventh out of twelve nations for the team event. The results were described by The Guardian as \\"not encouraging\\" for the later rounds. Oliver, Folkard, and Williamson were eliminated by Russia in the first round of the team event. Three days later in the opening round of the individual event Oliver delivered a surprise victory over India's Deepika Kumari, the world's number one-ranked female archer, despite shooting poorly in the match's second set. Oliver called the win over Kumari, who entered as one of the favourites in the individual competition, as \\"the highlight of my career\\" and considered it a greater achievement than her previous medal successes. She would later bow out in the second round to Indonesia's Yuliana Rochmawati.

During his career he was principally associated with the University of Iowa and the Quad City Symphony Orchestra. Early life James Allen Dixon was born in Estherville, Iowa and raised and educated in Guthrie Center, Iowa. He started working at the age of 11 as a shoe shine boy at a barber shop. He went on to work in a bakery and then for a year as the part owner of a small farm. He conducted his first orchestra on May 8, 1945 in Guthrie Center. Germany had surrendered that day to end World War II in Europe. The orchestra's conductor was out of town and Dixon volunteered to direct the impromptu concert. Dixon studied conducting at the University of Iowa where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1952 and a master's degree in 1956. Between his undergraduate and graduate education he served in the United States Army where he conducted the Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra in Germany. He studied for nine years under his mentor, the distinguished Greek conductor, pianist, and composer Dimitris Mitropoulos. Mitropoulos made Dixon his heir and left him his scores. Career Dixon first conducted the University of Iowa Symphony when he was a graduate student. After he received his master's degree he taught at the New England Conservatory. He conducted NEC's orchestra for 20 concerts during the 1959-1960 and the 1960-1961 seasons. Dixon then served as the assistant conductor of the Minnesota Orchestra for a year before returning to the University of Iowa in 1962. He taught conducting and was the conductor of the University of Iowa Symphony. Dixon commissioned a symphony from Anthony Burgess, which he did for no payment. Burgess' Symphony No. 3 in C premiered in Iowa City on October 22, 1975. The symphony became the first public performance of the orchestral work of Burgess, and it significantly increased his composing activity. During Dixon's tenure at Iowa the International Society for Contemporary Music met for the first time in the United States in 1976. The University of Iowa Symphony was one of three American orchestras chosen to perform an extensive program of new works. In 1965 James Dixon replaced Charles Gigante as the music director and conductor of the Tri-City Symphony Orchestra in Davenport, Iowa. It was renamed the Quad City Symphony while he was its music director. During his 29-year tenure with the orchestra he was credited with building the QCSO into ‚Äúan ensemble of musical distinction that is respected for the innovation of its programming and artistic integrity.‚Äù He also expanded the number of modern works into the orchestra's repertoire. Later life and death Dixon retired from the Quad City Symphony in 1994. Three years later he retired as the Philip Greeley Clapp/Carver Distinguished Professor of Music at the University of Iowa. During his career he was mentor to more than 30 conducting students and conducted the world premieres of close to 40 new works. Dixon led the Quad City Symphony for the last time in 2000. He died in Iowa City, Iowa at the age of 77 from complications from pneumonia and influenza.

They are usually near exits to increase the safety of women, to facilitate the act of parking, or to facilitate walking to shopping or employment destinations.  History  Women's parking spaces were originally designed in 1990 in Germany for women's safety and to reduce the risk of sexual assault.\\"Honk for Equality.\\" Global Citizen. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Apr. 2016. This was formulated because women felt at risk in parking garages due to the fact that not only were the parking garages so dark, but they were also typically deserted. After Germany, places like Korea and China also adopted this policy. It soon became a law in some regions of Germany that at least 30% of parking spots must be for women.\\"The Debate over Germany‚Äôs ‚Äòsexist‚Äô Women-only Parking Spaces.\\" Washington Post. The Washington Post, 10 Aug. 2015. Web. 15 Mar. 2016. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a study showed that 7.3% of violent crimes occurred in parking garages.\\"Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) - Location.\\" Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) - Location. N.p., n.d. Web. 15 Mar. 2016. In order to make women feel safer, companies provided more lighting in their parking garages, added surveillance systems, and incorporated parking spots closer to the exits and deemed them female-only parking or \\"she-spots\\". Over time, these parking spots began to be painted bright pink in order to depict that they were female only. These spots were also dressed with a sign stating \\"female only\\". Some facilities such as shopping malls and airports even widened the women's parking spots to make maneuvering in and out of parking spaces more convenient.Sun, Yazhou. \\"These 'Women Only' Parking Spots Are Extra-Wide and Pink.\\" ABC News. ABC News Network, n.d. Web. 21 Apr. 2016.  By country = Germany  In contrast to disabled parking spaces, women's parking spaces are not designated in the German road traffic code (Stra√üenverkehrsordnung) and are therefore only allowed in private parking areas. However, as landlord, the operator of the parking facility can insist that these spaces be used only by women as long as it is not claimed that the parking facility falls under the rules of the federal road traffic code. In some German states, women's parking spaces are provided for under garage regulations. For example, the garage regulations of North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein state that women's parking places: *must be marked as such *should be near the facility entrance *must be monitored by a security guard or by video surveillance *must be near an installed burglar alarm In the garage regulation of Baden- W√ºrttemberg, at least 10% of all spaces in large garages must be reserved for women. The garage regulation of Brandenburg stipulates that at least 30% of spaces must be for women.Brandenburg Garage and Parking Regulation (Brandenburgische Garagen- und Stellplatzverordnung- BbgGStV) from October 12, 1994, last changed March 23, 2005 , ¬ß 5 (2) The German Federal Anti- Discrimination Agency stated on their website that the establishment of women's parking spaces does not violate the General Equal Treatment Act (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz), because women are more likely than men to be victims of sexual abuse. According to the Hessian State Office of Criminal Investigation, the furnishing of women's parking spaces is an ideal means of raising women's feelings of safety. However, according to federal criminal statistics published by the German police, molestation and attacks on women occur no more often in parking garages than in other places. In Hesse, in 2003, only one of 1000 crimes in parking garages was sexual in nature.Report on the safety of parking garages in police criminal statistics. Woman parking on men's parking space in Triberg A small town in southern Germany, Triberg introduced the antonym, the globally first men's parking spaces in 2012 and caused a major media hype. The two Triberg slots are based on a technical peculiarity, since the slots in question are much more difficult to maneuver into than normal spaces.Focus Online: Deutschlands erste M√§nnerparkpl√§tze: Ist das sexistisch? Hier rangieren nur echte Kerle, abgerufen am 15. Juli 2012. The mayor of Triberg even explained that women would have difficulty parking there since the spaces require male drivers to back in diagonally without crashing into walls and a pillar. In fact, the mayor's exact words were, \\"But many also cannot park, like my secretary. Five times she tried and no success.‚Äù On a final note, to add a comical touch, these men-only parking spaces were even marked with \\"Mars\\" symbols. = Background = According to Ruth Becker's research about risk zones in town planning, neither men's nor women's risk assessments are in line with actual dangers, and the actual zone of risk is different for each gender. Women have more to fear in personal surroundings and at home, while men are objects (and dominantly subjects) of attack in the outside world.Ruth Becker Zeitschrift f√ºr Frauenforschung und Geschlechterstudien, Jg. 18, H. 4, 2000, p. 49-65 (5 Tab.)

Elizabeth Wilson, University of California Press, 1992, and assumes that women overestimate the dangers of urban surroundings. The focus on opening public spaces and areas to women (at least in Europe) is counterproductive. Herbert Glasauer doubts that women's parking lots have a positive effect, and sees them rather as a sort of backlash, perpetuating a view of the \\"damsel in distress\\" instead of addressing actual violence.Herbert Glasauer Gewalt ist nicht immer und √ºberall, Georg Glasze, Robert P√ºtz, Manfred Rolfes: Diskurs, Stadt, Kriminalit√§t: St√§dtische(Un-)Sicherheiten aus der Perspektive von Stadtforschung und kritischer Kriminalgeographie. transcript Verlag, 2005. S.206ff  China  In the Chinese province of Hebei, women's parking spaces have been established in shopping centers. These are wider and are clearly marked in different colors. This was made to ease parking for women, according to the representative of one shopping center. In the Wonder Mall in Hebei, one of three underground lots is designated for women. The spaces are between 3.2 and 3.3 meters wide, so that even when car doors are fully open, they do not touch neighboring cars, a measure intended to reduce the number of collisions. The state-run Global Times daily tabloid, allegedly citing insurance company data, states that female drivers cause twice as many collisions in parking lots than in other places.Global Times: Women only parking While other countries seem to use these spots to create a safe environment for women, there has been controversy across the media in regards to sexism, since China is the only country that has made these spots significantly bigger. At the Wonder Mall in Hebei, there is an entire parking garage reserved for women, which contains spaces that were 80 centimeters larger than regular parking spaces. If women have trouble parking in the significantly bigger lots, there are dancing parking-lot employees designated to park the cars for them. The walls in the women-only parking garage are designed with the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac/horoscope as a precaution for female drivers who can remember a picture better than a parking space number.  South Korea  In 2009, the city government of Seoul painted 4,929 parking spaces pink so that women do not have to walk as far to their destination and make the city more conducive to wearing high heels.Will High- Heel-Friendly Streets Keep Seoul's Women Happy?, Time, 2009 To the public, these parking spaces are known as 'she-spots.\\" They are bordered with hot pink outlines and display the traditional woman logo (as seen in public bathrooms) which are marked with pink skirts as well. Their intentions are not to degrade women, but to add a \\"feminine touch\\" to the city. In fact, The Korea Times (2014) announced the $700 million, 4-year attempt to make the cities more female-friendly. Along with the female-only parking spaces, other ideas include adding thousands of new women-only toilets, and resurfacing city sidewalks with a soft material to ease tired feet for those wearing high heels. Likewise in Europe, these spaces are placed near entrances and exits in dark parking garages or lots. In addition, along with the beliefs of other European countries who use female-only parking, Korea explains that with the new construction of a female-friendly environment their intentions are not to leave men out and only benefit women, but to create a safe environment for everyone.  Indonesia  Some shopping malls in Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung,Ladies parking Kompas, 22 Desember 2009, Maaf, Ini Tempat Parkir Khusus Wanita and other cities have women's parking space: * Mall Pondok Indah * Plaza Senayan * Ciputra Town Square  Criticism  Women took offense to the fact that their designated parking spots were made larger because they thought it implied that women were bad drivers. Men also took offense to this because women get special treatment while men do not. The men did not understand why larger parking spaces were made for inexperienced female drivers but none for inexperienced male drivers considering women and men both have to take the same exam to receive a driver's license.\\"Women-only Parking Spaces Discriminatory?\\" Women-only Parking Spaces Discriminatory? - Academic Photo News. N.p., 19 Aug. 2015. Web. 15 Mar. 2016. They felt this went against gender equality. Another issue arose when a town in Germany labeled two parking spots as reserved for men based on the sole fact that they were harder to maneuver into, further backing up the claims that women were being discriminated against for their driving skills.Clark, Andrew. \\"Germany's Women-only Parking Spaces: Sexism or Safety?\\" The Globe and Mail. Special to The Globe and Mail, 27 Aug. 2015. Web. 15 Mar. 2016. On the one hand, one criticism of these signs is that it is inherently sexist to discriminate against one gender and give one gender an obvious benefit. Another criticism pointed out by many relates to the purpose of introducing these signs into society. Primarily, these signs are meant to provide women a safer route to where they mean to walk to. However, some critics point out that men are the majority of murder victims, and it is against basic logic to not give men a safer passage since they are more likely than women to be victims of murder. On the other hand, some feminists did not take to the fact that the spots were painted pink, much less that a woman wearing a pink mini skirt was also painted on the spot. They thought this was considered very sexist and demeaning toward women, while others just considered it as a symbol that was known worldwide. In response to the controversy, government officials said that women received the closer parking spots so they did not have to walk as far with kids. It was also said that the parking spots were made larger so women can have more room to take the kids out of their vehicles.Person, and Geraldine Herbert. \\"The 'she-spot' Debate: Are Female-only Parking Spaces Practical or Sexist?\\" Independent.i.e. N.p., 15 Aug. 2015.

It took the Israeli TV another year to approve the series. At that time, most Israeli TV movies produced by IBA, the only channel at that time, dealt only with Israeli identity topics. He came up with a series that dealt with intimate fears. Late Night Stories is a TV thriller series of 13 films written, directed, produced and composed by Behagen between 1987 and 1991 and aired in Israel between 1988 and 1991.

Tracking the progress of what is done by each worker in a typical day is becoming increasingly complex as organizations grow, both internally (growing employee numbers, responsibilities) and externally (multiple locations, remote employees). Activity management systems create an easily accessible format for tracking the performance of both employees and employers.  Characteristics  A functional activity management environment places a heavy emphasis on properly defining the task at hand. The idea of activity management comes from the belief that in personal and group organization of workers, every action is related to higher levels of information, therefore proper labeling of the task is a critical element of the recording process. A task is related to a project, and that project is related to a higher subject level such as a customer or department or general category. With those labels in place, an employee would then describe the activity they have worked on, what they actually accomplished on the task, and any other details that they feel would be pertinent, including what still needs to be done, any future associated tasks, etc. Ideally, a typical activity entry would include all the elements below: 1\\\\. Activity ‚Äì this is a brief description of what you actually do. 2\\\\. Type of Activity (meeting, phone, e-mail, etc.) 3\\\\. Task Name 4\\\\. Project Name 5\\\\. Category Name 6\\\\. Length of Time 7\\\\. Date ''' Tracking these 6 pieces of info on a timely basis creates an accurate and complete record and gives both employee and employer a substantial amount of performance data for that individual. It also assists in avoiding common miscommunications in the workplace and helps solidify and reinforce the role/importance of the task at hand. This type of activity management is influenced heavily from Peter Drucker‚Äôs theory on time management among knowledge workers, and the belief that the closest thing to our thoughts that we can measure are our actions and activities. David Allen, whose Getting Things Done method rests similarly on the idea that a person needs to move tasks out of the mind by recording them externally, thus freeing the mind from the job of remembering to concentrate on performing tasks, also plays a significant influence on this method. The main obstacle, according to Drucker, still at hand in the work force is the persistence among managers to continue to embrace 20th century management practices instead of adapting to a more modern approach to the current business landscape. The antiquated command and control approach used in past centuries does not work for knowledge workers because the employees themselves own the means of production (their minds). For this reason, the most important people to practice activity management are the senior leaders and management team at a company. The ability to open communications through tracking their own activities for their workforce to view effectively sends a culture message communicated throughout the organization, and helps reinforce the fact that it‚Äôs the manager‚Äôs job to lead by example. At PARC, researcher Victoria Bellotti also found that email is the main place where most people do task or activity management.  Results  Properly tracking work activity subsequently acts as a conduit to worker transparency , and the performance data that comes from the tracking of activities gives both employee and supervisors access to updates as well as observe the progress made by workers daily. Being able to track employee work/time on tasks also assists in identifying where improvements can be made along the way. Depending on how tools and software are used to track, project progress could be filtered and viewed by various means, including by total work time spent on or through a detailed timeline displaying the order that work has been done, thus giving an organization different approaches to digesting the data shown as well as an idea of how to properly control project-related costs. The ability to record activities in one centralized area in turn helps reduce time spent among workers on extraneous tasks like drafting an email or physically hunting down a co-worker for the status of an assignment. Having the power to visibly inspect and review the progress of a piece of work is a major influencer of emotions, and gives them not only more positive perceptions of the work itself, but of their colleagues and their organization. In Teresa Amabile and Steven J. Kramer‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Power of Small Wins,‚Äù the two go in depth to enforce the fact that ‚ÄúOf all the things that can boost inner work life, the most important is making progress in meaningful work.‚Äù The ability to track and manage activities also carries along with it intrinsic social cues in the workplace. The collection of viewable data for employees makes it easier to define and reinforce acceptable behavior in the workplace, as well as allows supervisors and co-workers to learn what/how their peers think and feel throughout their day.

They are found especially in Scandinavia, in the German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Lower Saxony (Salongrab), Saxony-Anhalt (Drebenstedt, Leetze, Winterfeld) and occasionally in Holstein (Alter Hau). They are strikingly large stone blocks that form the corner post of enclosures or project above them like antae and lend the stone enclosures a monumental appearance. Guardian stones are typical of trapezoidal enclosures. In Germany the most impressive examples of trapezoidal sites are Dwasieden, Dummertevitz and Nobbin on the island of R√ºgen. * At the Great Dolmen of Dwasieden, guardian stones of 3.3 and 3.5 metres in height guard the wide end of the dolmen and ones of 1.4 and 1.6 metres high stand sentinel at the narrow end. * At the wide end of the trapezoidal enclosure of Nobbin there are guardian stones of 3.3 and 3.4 metres in height, each weighing 25 tons. At the narrow end they are 1.5 metres high and weigh just under six tons. On the mainland, only a stone block at the enclosure of Kritzow, Parchim, reaches such a height. The guardian stones of sites in the Altmark are up to 2.8 metres high. At several sites, guardian stones have been so arranged that the corner blocks jut out at an angle from the phalanx of stones. For example, the simple dolmen of Frauenmark, Parchim county, and the passage grave of , in the county of Prignitz. At the large passage grave of Naschendorf, Nordwestmecklenburg all the blocks at the narrow end are arranged in a concave way, so that the corners are very prominent. The same shape is seen at the wide end of the trapezoidal bed of Kruckow, Demmin county. Entirely outside the phalanx of the enclosure are the guardian stones at a number of rectangular enclosures. These blocks are anta-like extensions of the stone sides of the enclosure and stand in front of it. Other guardian stones stand out very little or not at all from the rest of the stone enclosure. Examples are the enclosures of Grevesm√ºhlen-Barendorf, Nordwestmecklenburg, Barkvieren, Rostock county and Mankmoos, Nordwestmecklenburg. A variation of the guardian stone concept are those ends of long enclosures where all (four or five) almost equally high stones are many times higher than the stones along the two sides, as is the case at the Visbeker sites (Visbeker Braut und Br√§utigam). Investigations of the guardian stones of Dwasieden, Lancken-Granitz 1 and Nobbin revealed that the stones were not erected separately from the remaining blocks in the enclosures. Their bases are located at the same height as the other stones in the enclosure and there are or were always links in the shape of dry stone walls, to the other blocks. Although value was placed on especially high guardian stones, in general only glacial erratics were used that had a good surface on which to stand and therefore guaranteed stability. This necessity is demonstrated by the guardian stone of the Dwasieden site, which did not have a good base area for stability and fell over, as the 40 cup marks on its upper surface show.  Significance  The cleared area between the guardian stones of the Nobbin stone enclosure (H√ºnenbett), down to the bedrock, gave no clues as to the specific use of the place. It is striking that, at the ends of many megalithic sites large quantities of flint flakes were found, that apparently were produced on the spot, because there were piles of them where some of the flakes came from the same source. Such observations were there also at the guardians of Dwasieden and Lancken- Granitz. What is most impressive are the many flakes that on several piles at the stele-like blocks of the enclosure of the expanded dolmen 2 of Serrahn, Neustrelitz county, came to light. They lay together in such a way that their production must have taken place on the spot where they were found, without doubt. Flakes in large numbers were also found on a capstone of the passage grave 1 of Gnewitz, Bad Doberan county. Not one of the flakes has been reworked; they therefore represent the waste from knapping.

Synopsis The first scene is set in a street in Seville, where the dancing of a crowd is interrupted by a girl being chased by Carmen. Their fight is only stopped by the arrival of Don Jos√©, who assists Carmen's defeated opponent. As he is about to arrest Carmen he is struck by her allure and arranges an assignation for later. That evening in the tavern Don Jos√© enters and dances a zapateado to the music of the habanera. Carmen next appears and dances, ending at Don Jos√©'s feet; he lifts her up and they go up to the bedroom. The customers dance and when Carmen and Don Jos√© return they join in before Jos√© wraps Carmen in his cape and they go off. The third scene is in Carmen's bedroom. After a passionate duet, three of Carmen's friends come in and invite her to go outside. At night in the street, Carmen, Don Jos√© and the friends prepare to rob a passer-by. Using a dagger Carmen has given him, Don Jos√© stabs a man, and after the women have taken his purse, they all flee. The final scene is set outside the bull-ring where girls await the arrival of their hero, the toreador. He enters and greets them but is fascinated by the indifference shown by Carmen. Jos√© enters and notices their looks. The toreador moves into the arena whereupon Don Jos√© threatens Carmen, and in a fight to the death he overcomes her. As she dies, hats are tossed from the bull-ring to land at his feet.Synopsis adapted from: Brinson, Peter & Crisp, Clement. Ballet for all. Pan Books, London, 1970, p266-268.

LGBT Life. Web. 29 May 2012. Meaning Lucha libre (Hispanic freestyle wrestling) is a blend of art and sport that involves various fighting techniques such as judo, jujitsu, grappling and kickboxing. It‚Äôs a world of masked luchadores (enmascarados), flying little people and flamboyant costuming, one filled with acrobatics and athleticism, all mixed with drama, pageantry and a physical comedy that is uniquely Latino origin. Everything that a luchador says, does, and wears is essential to their character and their performance. There are different kind of luchadores who represent good and evil, t√©cnico or rudo/heel, and queers. Lucha libre is a space in which the macho-maric√≥n (heterosexual-homosexual continuum) is represented not only in the relative positioning of men competing over who is \\"more\\" macho but also by men who have abdicated their masculinity. Many gay wrestlers show in their performances that they may identify as a female, but can be just as strong as a male, and can deliver a great performance just like any other male wrestler. Lucha libre is a performance that is open to multiple readings on axis of representation by two men. Many lucha libre matches cannot be described as a struggle between two men, because not all wrestlers are male, and not all male wrestlers are unambiguously men. A lucha libre match between two men represents a rudo and a t√©cnico (evil and good), in which most ex√≥ticos end up being rudos. This does not apply to all ex√≥ticos, but the audience usually responds to them being a rudo. History In the 1940s the first exoticos were seen in the history of Lucha Libre. Initially, the category of exoticos was formed as simply an act for entertainment; it did not reflect the life of any luchador. One of the earliest acknowledged exotico was Sterling Davis also known as Gardenia Davis (ring name). Gardenia would enter the ring by throwing gardenias at the crowd. But up until the late 1980s, exoticos claimed that the act was just an act and that it did not reflect any personal lifestyles. In the mid 1980s two luchadores trained by Reynosa began wrestling as exoticos but unlike previous exoticos, they did not deny their homosexual identity publicly. \\"The exoticos changed the exotico style from a representation of a tendency to a representation of a social category and celebrated lucha libre as a means of upward mobility for themselves specifically as homosexuals\\". \\"I love it. I come from a \\"machismo‚Äô family in which many are homophobic. I‚Äôve had many doors slammed in my face, but I am who I am. What you see is what you get. I‚Äôm gay, and I‚Äôve had no problem saying it.\\" Many Lucha libre fanatics would argue that exoticos are \\"not quite men\\", but exoticos defend themselves, the thing that maricones are thought to, by definition, not capable of doing. Interpretation As the connotation behind the meaning of being an exotico began to change and shifted from simply being an act to actually forming a category for female and gay representation in the ring, gender roles started to change. Not only were women‚Äôs gender roles challenged but they were also seen as a threat by machistas. For example, Juana Barraza Samperio was a known exotico wrestler and serial killer who challenged gender norms. Barraza‚Äôs wrestling body transgresses the normative gender and sex roles socially defined for women, thus challenging normative productions of mexicanidad. The physical strength that Barraza presents in the photograph as the la Dama del Silencio resists the ‚Äòhistorical notions of the properly feminine body constituted as \\"weak and pathological\\" and the culturally dominant codes of femininity that render women outside \\"sports as cults of masculinity\\" especially in a Mexican cultural context where sports like lucha libre and physical strength are only celebrated for men; female bodies are culturally accepted if ‚Äònaturally‚Äô feminine, that is, if they do not threaten the dominant codes of the idealized Mexican, that is the mestizo and macho. As Balsamo (1996) explains, to be female and strong implicitly violates traditional codes of feminine identity\\". By having a female presence in the ring, Mexican women were empowered because they were now having a part in something that was seen as manly. The female presence in the sport showed that women and gay men could do the same things as men without a doubt. This threatened social norms because the traditional Machismo does not like strong women. Significance Yosuke‚ô•Santa Maria, a Japanese ex√≥tico. Santa Maria adopted the persona when she (Santa Maria uses feminine pronouns) joined the Millennials, a group with a lucha libre style. Heather Levi has argued that lucha libre‚Äôs theatricality challenges mainstream machismo in Mexico in the performance of certain wrestlers, like ex√≥ticos. Exoticos challenge the traditional norms of what a man should and should not do, and challenge that idea that a maricon can not defend himself. Foremost, they also allow women to empower themselves by bringing a female presence to the ring. Although there are audience members that do not take exoticos seriously, their act has really helped challenge traditional machismo and has been effective enough to even be considered a threat by \\"ideal\\" machismo. \\"Ex√≥ticos then contest the production of mexicanidad as they challenge the ideal mestizo-macho heterosexual) wrestler. As such, female wrestlers also challenge lucha libre‚Äôs traditional performances and, while women wrestlers only fight other women and cannot literally unman male opponents in the ring, they do so culturally, since female wrestlers transgress the codes of normative femininity inside and outside the ring.\\" Although women don‚Äôt actually fight with men in the ring, they are represented by exoticos since they are openly homosexual. This allows women to empower themselves even more and have a type of vision that gives them equal rights. The biggest reason why this is seen as a threat by traditional machismo is because once these women are empowered, they realize that they have the same rights as men do therefore disempowering machismo completely. The fact that exoticos can physically challenge a man in the ring and physically challenge male masculinity is what makes the role of exoticos so crucial to the transformation of social norms. The outfit of an exotico is known to be different regarding its style and colors. The outfit represents different aspects of their identity and their stance against machismo, while empowering women. \\"Her face is covered with a silver and bright pink butterfly mask. Barraza‚Äôs wrestling photograph thus juxtaposes markers of her physical strength with those of femininity, codified through butterflies and the bright pink color of her suit. In doing so, the photo creates what Anne Balsamo calls a ‚Äògender \\"hybrid\\" that invokes corporeal codes of femininity as well as of masculinity. The outfit that these men in drag sport help define their category of an exotico.

She currently lives in Philadelphia. She is currently doing research on street musicians in Condesa in Mexico City. Her research mainly focuses on performance practices, global and local contexts, and the political uses to which they are directed. Levi has performed ethnographic field work on lucha libre in Mexico City and the significance it has in the Mexican culture. Not only did she do ethnographic field work, but she also trained with a retired lucha libre wrestler and his students. Levi worked with this well respected wrestler for a year and a half and incorporated this as research into her book The World of Lucha Libre Paul Constant, Seattle Stranger, Book Review This allowed Levi to view lucha libre as an arena that examined the connections between ideas of mestizaje, class, gender, aesthetic values, mass mediation, and the state.

Early life Martin was born on December 18, 1841 in Albany, New York. He was the son of Henry Hull Martin (1809‚Äì1886) and Anna Townsend Martin (1815‚Äì1866). His siblings included Frederick Townsend Martin (1849‚Äì1914), writer and advocate for the poor, and Henry Townsend Martin (d. 1915). His maternal grandfather was Solomon Townsend, a prominent merchant who was from an old Albany family that was related to the Long Island Townsends. His father was a prominent banker and merchant and the family was involved in Albany society. His ancestor, John Martin, accompanied Sir Francis Drake in his famous voyage around the world in 1580. Martin was educated at Union University and was a First lieutenant in the 93rd Regiment, National Guard of New York, part of the Union Army during the American Civil War. He later served as aide-de-camp to Gov. Reuben Fenton. Society life In 1884, Martin leased Balmacaan, a well known game preserve in parish of Urguhart, Inverness-shire Scotland, a mile from Drumnadrochit, from Lady Seafield. From that point on, they generally lived there except for a few months, generally during the Winters, they spent in New York. Martin was a member of the Union Club. In January 1885, the Martins gave a ball for the \\"Four Hundred\\" invited guests at their residence, which was considered, with the exception of the Vanderbilt \\"fancy dress ball of 1883, \\" the most unique and beautiful entertainment ever enjoyed by the members of New York Society. They gave another ball, on February 8, 1890, for 300 friends at Delmonico's followed by a cotillion. When his daughter married the Earl of Craven in 1893, the press reported that: \\"The British lion captured another American prize yesterday, and $1,000,000 more of Yankee money has gone to swell English exchequers.\\" Bradley-Martin Ball On February 10, 1897, the Bradley Martins threw their most famous ball, the Bradley-Martin costume ball at the Waldorf Hotel. His wife organized the ball, intending it to be \\"the greatest party in the history of the city\\". 800 of New York's elite Society spent about $400,000 imitating kings and queens. It has been called \\"The most ostentatious party in US history.\\" The Bradley-Martin's stated that their goal was to create an economic stimulus for New York City, which was at the end of an economic slump which began in 1873 and included the Panic of 1893. Many prominent preachers and writers argued over the propriety of a party that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In the end, the ball was judged a social triumph but negative publicity. Personal life A Cameo of Cornelia Bradley-Martin dressed as Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, for the Ball. Martin met his future wife, Cornelia Sherman (1843‚Äì1920), at the wedding of Emily Vanderbilt, second daughter of William H. Vanderbilt, to William Sloane, where she was one of Vanderbilt's bridesmaids. The couple courted, were soon engaged, and were married about a year later. Cornelia was the only child and heir of Isaac Sherman (d. 1881), a retired merchant who lived on West Twentieth Street in New York and was close friends with Abraham Lincoln. Together, they were the parents of three children: * Sherman Martin (1869‚Äì1894), who died aged 25 in New York of apoplexy, but rumors at the time indicated it was suicide. He was married to Annie Nunn, an English girl. * Bradley Martin, Jr. (1873‚Äì1963), who married Helen Margaret Phipps (1876-1934), a daughter of Henry Phipps, Jr., in 1904. * Cornelia Martin (1877‚Äì1961), who married William Craven, 4th Earl of Craven (1868‚Äì1921), son of George Craven, 3rd Earl of Craven and grandson of George Barrington, 7th Viscount Barrington, in 1893. Martin died of influenza, which developed into pneumonia, on February 5, 1913 in London, England. At his death, his New York estate was valued at $1,277,341. The foreign estate was not valued as Martin took up permanent residence in England in 1899. His widow died at her country residence at Hamstead Marshall, England on October 24, 1920. The Martin estate, which was left equally to his daughter and living son, was valued at $4,412,404 upon his wife's death in 1920.

This image has thrived for the decades since Che Guevara's death and has evolved into an iconic image, which represents a multitude of ideals. The documentary explores the story of how the photo came to be, its adoption of multiple interpretations and meanings, as well as the commercialization of the image of Ernesto ‚ÄúChe‚Äù Guevara. Chevolution utilizes historic images and a multitude of artists, musicians, photographers, actors, academics, friends, fans, and acquaintances to explore the contrasting themes of ‚Äúcommunism and capitalism, idealism and opportunism, art and commerce and how they have interacted and operated on the same materials during the past half century.‚Äù  The photographer  In the documentary Chevolution, Alberto D√≠az Guti√©rrez is an essential character in the creation and reproduction of Che as an icon. Alberto Korda was a well-known Cuban fashion photographer and socialite. The documentary explains how after capturing a powerful image of a poor infant Cuban girl, which he titled La Ni√±a, he decided to leave the fashion world and use his photographic talent to promote and document the Cuban Revolution. Korda began taking pictures for the propaganda newspaper Revoluci√≥n. The documentary also provides an anecdote about Korda asking Che if he could take his picture, Guevara responded by asking Korda where he was from and if he had ever cut sugar. Korda informed him that he was from Havana and had never cut sugar. Guevara stipulated that once Korda had cut sugar cane for a week, he would be free to take Guevara's picture.  The photo  Chevolution commemorates when Korda snapped the photo at the massive funeral in the Plaza de Revoluci√≥n for those who had died in the bombing of a boat carrying weapons from Belgium, La Coubre, in Havana Harbor. Korda was fortunate to captured only two photos of Guevara that day and after submitting them, the newspaper chose not to use them. One of the two photos included the Guerillero Heroico. Living in communist Cuba, copyright laws were non-existent so Korda initially obtained no rights to the portrait.  Evolution of image  Chevolution explains how the politically radical, outspoken, and self- proclaimed communist Giangiacomo Feltrinelli was the first to mass-produce the photo by producing hundreds of thousands of posters of the image. Feltrinelli printed these posters with ‚Äúcopyright Feltrinelli 1976‚Äù in the bottom left hand corner giving no credit to Korda. This has caused some controversy as some, including Korda, claim that Feltrinelli made a lot of money from the image while others contest that this is simply not true. The documentary also emphasizes that it is unclear exactly when the first time the image was used. The photo gained widespread notoriety after Guevara's death in Bolivia. Critics in the documentary claim that at Guevara's funeral Fidel Castro used the image on a banner, which served as a backdrop as he delivered Guevara's eulogy. Throughout the late 1960s, worldwide student movements, and the Civil Rights Movement in the United States utilized the image as a symbol of struggle, rebellion and revolution. Chevolution describes the moments in which after a visit with Jean-Paul Sartre, Korda gave the French philosopher a copy of the photograph; Sartre in turn gave it to artist Jim Fitzpatrick. In the documentary Fitzpatrick shares that after hearing the story of Guevara's murder he was devastated and very sad. He then decided to add his artistic touch to the image in an effort to ensure that Guevara's legacy lived on. In a style known as pop art, he set the black and white portrait of Guevara against a red backdrop with a gold star on his beret. Fitzpatrick purposely chose not to copyright the image, as he states that he wanted it to ‚Äúbreed like rabbits‚Äù The documentary describes how by the 1990s the image had evolved from one used as a form of protest to one used to make a profit. Korda felt that he too should share in the profit of the photo and hired lawyers to attain the copyright image. While Korda did not want to keep people from using it all together, he did want to limit what kinds of messages and products the image was used in an effort to keep the image from being used for commercial or inappropriate purposes.  Production  Louis Lopez and Trisha Ziff directed Chevolution, a documentary that honors the longevity of Che Guevara's photo taken by Alberto Korda. It was released in theaters on April 1, 2008 and released on DVD on January 19, 2010. It has a running time of 1 hour and 26 minutes. The film provides commentary from a variety of perspectives including: actors Antonio Banderas and Gael Garc√≠a Bernal, the author of ‚ÄúChe Guevara a revolutionary life‚Äù Jon Lee Anderson, the American rock band Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, photographers Jose Figueroa and Laborio Naval, artists Shepard Fairey and Jim Fitzpatrick, and long-time friend Alberto Granado.  Representation  In the Chevolution documentary the image of Che Guevara is demonstrated as one that has survivability and has had presence throughout historic events such as social movements and demonstrations. The image of Che conveys different meanings depending on the people, where and at what period in time is being used. He represents people involved in movements who are empowered by him. The Zapatistas for instance, continue to harvest the seed that Che left instill in them and continues to have meaning. Che is the ultimate icon for rebels. Chevolution examines the importance of interpretation of the famous and mass-produced image of Che Guevara, which his due to the lack of copyright. The lack of copyright is also argued to reflect the ideals of Che in regards to capitalism. Che, as discussed in the documentary, represents the people and their struggle. Che has been adopted in social and political struggles. The image has taken on many different meanings through its multitude of representations.  Commercialization  The Che image and idealization continues to carry powerful meaning and is mass-produced with various interpretations that evolve over time. In the documentary Chevolution the image is described as a symbol that represents something unique to each individual and cause. The documentary describes how its multiple meanings and interpretations are displayed through the different forms of art and commercialization of the portrait. Through various art forms it has been and continues to be modified and reconstructed to have different meaning or manipulate its representation. Commercialization of the image has expanded to pictures, swimming suits, beer, wallets, socks, shirts, cigarettes, even in cartoons such as South Park and The Simpsons. The commercialization of Che in all forms has contribute the recognition and persistence of the icon. Che was a devout Marxist who rejected the corporate model and capitalism. Chevolution also discusses how capitalist society has overtaken the Che image and whether or not it reflects his ideologies.  Che tattoo  In the documentary a young Cuban man is captured being tattooed with the face of Che on his arm. He says that as Cubans they are told stories and constantly talked about Che in school at an early age, which gave him the childhood inspiration to get a Che tattoo. Che serves as an icon that represents the struggle of the Cuban people and a heroic freedom fighter. The documentary also illustrates how the image of Che reflects heroism to Cubans and how it is intertwined with Cubanness.  Comparing Che with Christ  Chevolution also discusses the interpretation of Che's death and the images that showed him lying dead on a piece of cement in Bolivia. The interpretation was the comparison of Che with Jesus Christ. As dramatic as it is,t he documentary discusses how this comparison happened immediately after images of a lifeless Che were released. Che repeatedly claimed his solidarity with the people's struggle and believed in victory by any means possible. The documentary also compares the cause of Jesus' death and comments on the idea of collective guilt felt amongst many as Che died for people's freedom. Chevolution talks about Che's image as a sacred icon in Bolivia and how Bolivians revere him as a saint. The documentary highlights the significance in recognizing the interpretation of Che in Vallagrande, Bolivia. In Bolivia people refer and pray to Saint Ernesto de la Higuera, although the Catholic Church does not recognize Ernesto Che Guevara as a Saint. Che has also been seen as a representation of Christ. Che's beret is interpreted as his crown of thorns, which becomes Che's crown of thoughts. The documentary shows Armando Krieger, an Argentine composer who plays a piano piece meanwhile there is a female singing in an angelical voice in words that praise Che. This religious aspect of society reflects the power of Che, his ideals, image, and the hope he provided the poor and less fortunate.  Political icon  Chevolution also discusses the usage of Che's image by Rage Against the Machine on the 1992 single, \\"Bombtrack\\". In Chevolution, Tom Morello, guitarist of the band, explains how the use of Che's image on instruments on stage represents a 5th member. Che represents the bands political ideas and is used in a radical context. Morello also says to believe that Che's image is a public domain piece and people as a whole own the image. Che represented and still represents poor, powerless and marginalized people who want freedom and their human rights to be respected. Che's ideals did not die when he died, they live on through his image. Shepard Fairey a well-known artist contributes to the documentary by stating that the image of Che has become an important aspect of pop culture and culture creation. Shepard talks about his own recreation or exploitation as he refers to his interpretation of the image. Participating and commenting on this specific politically influential image Fairey explains that his reproduction of the image conveys the continuing revolutionary message that Che represents. He also talks about his work within the capitalist system and emphasized on the consumption of Che‚Äôs followers and how his creation adds to the many others that exist. The many different forms of admiration for Che have contributed to his legacy and in this case the documentary provides a vast array of songs dedicated to Che. Throughout the documentary the following songs are played, ‚ÄúEl Che 2007‚Äù by Armando Krieger and performed by Roberto Falcon, ‚ÄúChe Guevara T-shirt Wearer‚Äù by Luke Hoskins and performed by The Clap, ‚ÄúHasta Siempre‚Äù by Carlos Manuel Puebla and performed by Boikot.

Titled after a close-knit historically African American district of shotgun houses that once occupied a segregated neighborhood in Miami, Florida, the cd was released by Thirsty Ear Music, produced by Carl Hancock Rux with songwriting and co- songwriting credits from Geoff Barrow, Vinicius Cantu√°ria, David Holmes, Rob Hyman, Stewart Lerman, Darren Morris, Phil Mossman, Vernon Reid, Tim Saul, Jaco Van Schalkwyk, and Bill Withers. The cd tackles religion, sexual politics, war and media overload, in the tradition of Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway, employing supersaturated, open-ended soul music with bluesy vamps, touches of minimalism, and slide-guitar licks providing a rich backdrop for Rux's sardonic baritone, achieving a pop-gospel synthesis.

The musical settings shoot off in half a dozen different musical directions, depending on the inclinations of his collaborator, or the sample or loop used as the germ of each idea. Rux works in the manner of a rapper but the result is somehow fresher than much rap, and less self-regarding. Lies, co-written with Vernon Reid, uses a vocal harmony hook reminiscent of Moby or Alan Wilder's Recoil, while Black of My Shadow marries the instantly recognisable acoustic guitar chords of Vinicius Cantuaria to Helga Davis's soaring spirituals. My Brother's Hands is oddly reminiscent of Virginia Astley or the Blue Nile. Rux also delivers a moving reinvention of Bill Withers' I Can't Write Left Handed. The most focused piece is the title track, where a majestic, dirty blues vamp underscores another heartfelt soliloquy: \\"Our religiosity has got to be more/ Than historical animosity.\\" THE GUARDIAN \\"For most poets-who-sing or singers- who-poet, the blues is a shirt to be worn instead of a whole wardrobe. But Rux is rooted in the blues, both musically and philosophically. ‚ÄúGeneva‚Äù features Dave Tronzo‚Äôs slinky slide guitar and Marcelle Lashey‚Äôs heroic testifying, both of which play perfectly against Rux‚Äô tale of a hairdresser who somehow seems like the legendary Greek heroine Atalanta. Even during the Eno/Fripp/Bowie atmospheric cloud of ‚ÄúMy Brother‚Äôs Hands (Union Song)‚Äù, collaborator Jaco van Schalkwyk starts to add congas and backup layers until everything simmers, and then Rux pours his vocabulary all over everything like gravy. Rux is the least pretentious of pretentious poets‚Äîhe even has the courtesy to introduce the protest song ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Write Left-Handed‚Äù with a brief spoken intro giving props to composer Bill Withers, right before he sings the holy living shit out of the song. Just listening to it makes my eyes fill up, especially since it seems like this god damned war in Iraq is never going to end. Carl Hancock Rux is out there, making things weird and lovely and furious and deep. If it might not be your cup of tea, maybe you need to drink something besides tea for a change.\\" POPMATTERS \\"Carl Hancock Rux tackles religion, sexual politics, war and media overload, which places him squarely in the tradition of Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway. Like Gaye and Hathaway, Rux creates supersaturated, open-ended soul music that can tend toward the programmatic, with bluesy vamps, touches of minimalism, and slide- guitar licks providing a rich backdrop for his sardonic baritone. On Behind The Curtain, Rux achieves a pop-gospel synthesis that recalls the work of Loves Arthur Lee. Black Of The Shadow features Brazilian guitarist Vinicius Cantuaria, while All The Rock Stars is a series of funk grooves that add up to an ingeniously dovetailed mutant samba. Rux sings with a sense of outrage, delivered with real passion.\\" NO DEPRESSION \\"Working with a smaller set of musicians -- and for a smaller label -- the multi-disciplinary artist Carl Hancock Rux delivers what is arguably his most musical album to date. There are more \\"songs\\" on Good Bread Alley than on the poet/author/vocalist's previous efforts, and Rux also uses his deep baritone singing voice more than usual. Hip-hop and electronica make brief appearances, but most of the sounds here are neo-cabaret, neo-classical, or downtown loft blues, played naked and live enough to suggest what a one-man show from Rux might sound like. On the opening title track, Rux drags behind him the faux synthesized orchestra that appears throughout the album. Decidedly fake horns and strings plod out the tune, denying their leader's Gil Scott-Heron-styled tale of \\"why didn't we see it coming\\" which fades in and out like a radio station on the edge of reception. From here, Good Bread Alley becomes more approachable, more warm, less produced, but no less evocative. The tales of \\"wine and war\\" mentioned on \\"Thadius Star\\" -- a song originally written for former Brooklyn Funk Essentials member Stephanie McKay's solo debut -- contrast wealth and poverty, success and failure, hope and disappointment. Rux has a firm grip on his art but he's humbled by the complexity of modern life and doesn't offer answers as much as advocate awareness. He recites his prose if need be, but more often sings his message with the earthy tone that has earned him the experimental blues tag he's been pigeonholed with. The desolate \\"Thadius Star\\" adds Brecht and Weill to the jumble of influences, along with Massive Attack, whose spirit is deep in the song's sensual slinking. \\"Black of My Shadow\\" puts spirituals and Billie Holiday through William S. Burroughs' cut-up treatment, while the taut \\"Living Room\\" unleashes the old-fashioned, straight-ahead R&B;, although the \\"Soul fury!\\" shouted out in the song speaks to domestic violence instead of Stax. There's also an incredible, heartbreaking cover of Bill Withers' protest song \\"I Can't Write Left Handed\\" here to prove Rux is also a gripping performer and interpreter. Still, with all the advancement he has made as a musician, his spellbinding words still offer the richest rewards and are the most responsible element in making Good Bread Alley the potent triumph it is.\\" ALL MUSIC \\"Magnificent rhythm can grab you every time. If the rhythm in this recording doesn‚Äôt penetrate your soul and you can‚Äôt hear the message, I would say that something is seriously lacking in your sensibilities. The character of this recording is basic. It begs to reach into the very recesses of your connections with human instinct. The seductive lure of Rux‚Äôs voice is clear. Entangle his vocalization with parallel forces of the music and the result is one hell of a statement.The decorative vehicle of the mixing does its job. The mixing supplies a programmatic layer to the words and buttresses their impact. The lyric metamorphoses nearly into opera. Each song reveals another avenue in the story. The story? About truth, justice and the American way? No, it is larger than that. The story is concerned with what to believe in at all given the constant confrontations that equal daily life for the African-American, the artist, the downtrodden, the disabled, the poor.... the minor players. Of course, the questions are raised about the direction in which anyone can go and once the direction is found can anyone be recognized for talent, giftedness, artfulness, beauty and, most significantly, mere humanness.The edge dividing the body and the soul and mind defies definition. How many times has art addressed this edge and from the addressing culture evolves. Carl Hancock Rux has worked with a stellar team to stretch and magnify electronic, blues, rap, classical, gospel, rock and jazz ethics into a peculiarly exuberant sound portrait of his compositions. His compositions walk the edge, going forward without teetering. Ain‚Äôt no mistaking Good Bread Alley for some pretentious effort to aggravate wrath at the status of the ever-present divisions between art and life. Rather Good Bread Alley gets you going and makes you pay attention, one more time. You are strangely liberated.\\" JAZZ REVIEW  References  2006 albums Carl Hancock Rux albums ","title":"Good Bread Alley"},{"id":"36074233","text":"Owja Bon (, also Romanized as OwjƒÅ Bon and ≈™jƒÅben; also known as ≈™hƒÅben) is a village in Anjirabad Rural District, in the Central District of Gorgan County, Golestan Province, Iran.

It was built by the Pacific Electric Railway to provide electricity to run the railway's streetcars in central Orange County, California. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Substation function Electric trolley and interurban cars required 600 volts direct current (DC) to operate a car's DC traction motors. The function of a \\"substation\\" was to convert very high voltage alternating current (AC) from a power generating plant, often miles away, for the necessary conversion to a lower voltage DC. High voltage AC entered the substation, was dropped to a lower voltage by a transformer, and then fed to a device called a Rotary Converter for the conversion to 600 volts DC. Substations were required on every trolley and interurban line in the United States and often still are for today's subway and light rail lines, although the very large and cumbersome rotary converter, as much as eight feet in diameter rotating and vibrating and requiring a human round-the-clock operator, has been replaced by small package solid state converters with no operator.[1]The Electric Interurban Raiways in America. George W. Hilton, UCLA, 1952. History Pacific Electric Railway's Santa Ana substation #14 was built in 1907 and still stands. It is a single- story, rectangular building made of brick with minimal classical ornamentation in its design. There are hollow pipes at each end for electric wires to enter and exit. Very high voltage alternating current (AC) from the Watts Steam Generating Station (30 miles away) entered at one end of the building and was converted (by rectification by a six foot high massive rotating machine called a rotary converter) to 600 volts direct current (DC) necessary to power the interurban trains, and the DC wires then exited the building at the opposite end. A transformer was located inside the building to drop the high voltage (delivered from Watts) to a lower voltage AC for the rotary converter. This substation powered the Watts‚ÄìSanta Ana Line, the Santa Ana‚ÄìOrange Line, and the Santa Ana‚ÄìHuntington Beach Line and was in service from 1907 until the cessation of passenger service in 1950. It is the last former Pacific Electric substation building remaining in Orange County. Substation #14 was listed in the National Register of Historic Places because of its association with the Pacific Electric Railways extensive operation in Orange County, as well as for its architecture.

June 16, 2020) was a leader of the Kayapo people, an indigenous tribe of Brazil. He led the Kayapo in their protests against destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Background Paiakan was hired by the Brazilian government in 1971 to facilitate the construction of the Trans- Amazonian highway system through Kayapo lands. Once Paiakan saw the nature of the project first hand, he quit his job and began to mobilize his people against the project. He took a splinter group of his home village and settled a new village named Aukre, where he set out to videotape the destruction of the rainforest and the Kayapo traditions. Paiakan became known on the world stage, touring Europe and North America with public appearances and speaking engagements, sponsored by Friends of the Earth, the World Wildlife Fund and the Kayapo Support Group of Chicago in a campaign against the Altamira Dam project. Speaking at the University of Chicago, he said: > The forest is one big thing; it has people, animals, and plants. There is no > point saving the animals if the forest is burned down; there is no point > saving the forest if the people and animals who live in it are killed or > driven away. The groups trying to save the races of animals cannot win if > the people trying to save the forest lose; the people trying to save the > Indians cannot win if either of the others lose; the Indians cannot win > without the support of these groups; but the groups cannot win either > without the support of the Indians, who know the forest and the animals and > can tell what is happening to them. No one of us is strong enough to win > alone; together, we can be strong enough to win. The World Bank announced that it would not grant Brazil a loan for the project after this campaign and the protest at Altamira that followed. Rape charge and subsequent trial In 1992, Paiakan was accused of raping a young white woman whom he had hired to tutor his children. He was accused of biting off the nipples and inserting both hands in the woman's vagina, among other things. In 1994, Paiakan was acquitted, but in a 1999 retrial, he was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison. The entire affair stigmatized not only Paiakan, but the entire indigenous peoples movement of which he had been such a key figure. Death Paiakan died on June 16, 2020, at the Hospital P√∫blico Regional do Araguaia in Reden√ß√£o, Par√° from COVID-19. He was around 65 years old at the time of his death.

It was the first serial drama to highlight themes and stories of political violence and the repressed who were under the military regime. There are many themes that were first introduced to Brazilian television with this show including themes of censorship, cultural memory, and torture. This television program was set in the authoritarian regime of the 1960s and portrayed the time period through the lives of a group of high school students who had to come of age in this era. This group of students are friends who all go to the college Pedro II in 1964. The show focuses on Jo√£o, and Maria L√∫cia, two lovers whose opposite political views cause an ongoing struggle between identity and love. Jo√£o, an idealist, eventually joins the armed struggle, while Maria L√∫cia is an individualist who has little tolerance for the risks attached to the leftist social fight against the dictator's regime.

The authoritarian regime justified its actions throughout the time period by arguing that they were operating under the need to promote National Security. Rede Globo, the popular Brazilian television network launched in 1965, was a staunch supporter of the authoritarian military regime in Brazil during its first two decades of existence. Globo backed the regime while censoring information about the tortures, murders, and ‚Äúdisappearances‚Äù that were taking place under the administration. Roberto Marinho, Globo's founder, justified this censorship by arguing that it was ‚Äúa good thing when it comes to [fighting] terrorism‚Äù. Although Globo generally praised the regime, it is important to note that Globo hired writers who were outspoken in their opposition to the government and Marinho himself came out against the regime on occasion. Nonetheless, Globo's allegiance to the military governments allowed them to conduct an illegal joint business opportunity with the Time-Life Corporation, which provided them with financial benefits and advantages over other networks. The network's close ties to the generals also gave Globo special consideration during the allocation of licenses and advertising deals that were funded by the state. After the military gave up control of the government in 1985, Globo had seemingly created a monopoly over the Brazilian television industry. To this day it is regarded as the chief television network in Brazil in terms of audience ratings and revenues generated from advertisements. In 1992, Globo became the first Brazilian television network to condemn the military dictatorship on prime-time television with the advent of ‚ÄúAnos Rebeldes‚Äù.  Cultural significance and purpose  The show was very popular, with over 30 million viewers tuning in to watch the telenovela. The show inspired young revolutionaries and the youth protest movement that sought to impeach Fernando Collor de Mello. Rebecca J. Atencio, author of A Prime Time to Remember, argues that Globo marketed the show to viewers by using ‚Äúsocial‚Äù and ‚Äúmemory merchandising‚Äù. According to Atencio, the network used the show to promote messages and issues (as opposed to commercial products) in order to bolster its public image, a process she refers to as social merchandising. The network also participated in memory merchandising by including historical and documentary aspects during scenes. Gilberto Braga, the creator and head scriptwriter of the show, created the show ‚Äúas a vehicle for promoting the memory of the authoritarian period so as not to repeat it‚Äù. Atencio also notes that some characters, such as Helo√≠sa, serve as memory agents. Helo√≠sa, though not a lead character, became a fan favorite after she made the transition from a pampered girl to a militant woman. She is the only character that is tortured in the show and thus serves to represent victims of torture and enables the show to advocate a pro-human rights message.

Background A God That Can Dance was privately released to family and friends in 1996. It chronicles Delph's struggle with HIV/AIDS and draws its title from a quote attributed in the liner notes to Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 ‚Äì 1900): :\\"I would believe only in a God that knew how to dance.\\" ‚Äî Thus Spoke Zarathustra Writing and recording The album was produced by Delph and Paul Marcus, who also wrote the majority of the material together. The album was engineered by Delph and Jim McMahon. It was recorded at Magic Bus Studio, Magic Studio, and The Aspen Studio, and mastered by Wally Traugott at Capitol Mastering, California. Both \\"Eternity Spin\\" and \\"The Dance at the End of Time\\" was written by American singer-songwriter Jimmie Spheeris. In 1983-4, he returned to the studio to record a new album that was produced by Delph, however he was killed by a drunken driver in 1984. The album, titled Spheeris, wasn't released commercially until 2000. In \\"Mad at God\\", the second verse speaks of Spheeris, where Delph questions whether his \\"best friend had to die\\", relating to the fatal motorcycle crash Spheeris was involved with. \\"Breath of Life\\" features vocal from singer and friend Vida Vierra. \\"Mama Don't Cry\\" is directed to Delph's parents. \\"Kyrie\\" was written by Medieval French poet and composer Guillaume de Machaut. \\"Let Yourself Go\\" was later used in the final scene of the 1999 US romantic comedy film Deal of a Lifetime.Deal of a Lifetime DVD Official Credits In 2003, to promote the release of the album, a radio broadcast on KOOP FM 91.7 in Austin, Texas, featured album personnel Paul Marcus, Vida Vierra, Doug Lunn and Andy Markley. Marcus commented: \\"Paul and I worked closely on the album, we'd been writing songs for about fifteen years, and he found out he was HIV positive and then finally told me. Slowly but surely we started writing these songs that were sort of a song cycle, and we didn't really realise that until about half way through, but it was basically documenting what he went through and what we were going through. It was very exciting, incredibly sad, and always powerful - what had happened - all the recording that went on during the sessions. Most of it happened in this Magic Bus, somebody had left a 24-track recording studio on a bus in Malibu, and said Paul, here you can use this.\\" Recalling \\"Mama Don't Cry\\", Marcus said: \\"I remember when he wrote \\"Mama Don't Cry\\", it came out of a conversation where I said 'you gotta tell your folks, you've got to tell them', if he wanted to protect them as he's a sweet guy who doesn't want anyone to hurt. And he did, and one of his ways of telling his mother was to write the song.\\" Three days after Delph's death, his mother, June, published a letter based on Paul's final week. She said: \\"Throughout the week, we played music for Paul - \\"A God That Can Dance,\\" and in particular, \\"Breath of Life,\\" also Jimmie Spheeris' CD that Paul put together of Jimmie's renditions of favorite songs.\\" Official release Growing interest in Delph's legacy later caused the album to be officially released on CD in 2003. It was digitally remastered and featured new artwork designed by Billy Vaughn, with inserts containing all the lyrics, credits and updated biography information. All sales of the album were to benefit the Paul Delph Memorial Scholarship Fund. After the album's release, five additional Paul Delph collections were to follow, but these have not yet appeared. Marcus said of the release: \\"It just had to be done, it's astonishing work, it's an amazing album.

The cataract is distinctly different from the centrifugal governor, in that it does not control the speed of the engine's stroke, but rather the timing between strokes.  Operation  Cataract, c. 1875 The typical installation of a house-built beam engine spanned four floors. The cylinder and the engine driver's usual working position were located in the 'bottom chamber', approximately at ground level. Above this were the 'middle chamber', with the cylinder top cover and 'top nozzle' (the upper valve chest), and above that the 'top chamber' or beam chamber. The cataracts were located in the lowest part of the engine house, in a chamber below the bottom chamber, along with the exhaust pipe. This space was awkward to access and not visited in normal operation. Valvegear, horns and arbors of the Crofton Pumping Station The valve gear (or 'working gear') of a Newcomen or Cornish engine is based on the plug rod. This is a vertical rod, hung from the beam, and moving in parallel to the piston. Adjustable tappets are attached to this rod. These tappets strike long curved iron levers or 'horns' that are carried on three horizontal shafts or 'arbors'. Each arbor works one of the engine's valves. For the Cornish cycles, these valves are the upper steam inlet to the top of the cylinder, the equilibrium valve that links upper and lower portions of the cylinder, and the lower exhaust and condensing water injection valves, which share an arbor. Unlike most other steam engines, these engines could be run intermittently: making a single stroke before stopping and waiting for the valves to be restarted again. The speed of each power stroke or 'coming indoors' was a feature of the engine and was not easily varied, but there was no need for the engines to run continuously, stroke after stroke. This was a direct contrast to the rotative beam engine, and the rotary nature of almost all other steam engines. With the original Newcomen cycle, the speed of the return stroke varied according to the boiler pressure, although this still did not affect the strength or speed of the power stroke. Use of a cataract could allow an engine to be operated at only a third of its ungoverned speed. When pumping load was variable, cataracts could also be connected and disconnected as required, allowing the engine to work at full speed for a period and then stopped in between. The cataract itself resembled a small plunger pump. It was an iron box in a cistern filled with water, with a plunger or piston set in the top and pressed downwards by a weight. The water within the pump could only escape through a small tap or valve. As the plunger gradually fell, its motion was passed upwards by a rocking lever and a rod to the valvegear in the middle chamber. Once the rod had risen sufficiently, this opened the first valve to admit steam into the upper part of the cylinder, beginning a new stroke. Once the stroke had begun, the cataract's rocking lever was pushed downwards by the engine. This lifted the plunger, which acted as a suction pump within the cataract to refill the plunger box, through a flap valve from its surrounding cistern. The cistern was kept filled with water by the pump that the engine itself was working. The water outlet valve was controlled by a rod from the bottom chamber. This was used by the engine's driver to control the working speed, according to the work required. The cataract's actuating rod also had a screw adjuster, which acted to vary the water injection time (Newcomen) or the phasing between the inlet and exhaust valves (Cornish). This could be used to give a longer and more effective condensation time, if the condensing water supply was warm, as in the Summer. This adjustment appears to have been poorly understood though, and little used by the engine drivers.  Development = Early cataracts  The cataract first appeared on Newcomen engines in Cornwall, although their inventor is unknown. They were known in Smeaton's time, and they may be another of the developments to Newcomen's engine for which he was responsible. James Watt encountered these on his trip to Cornwall in 1777. They were of a simpler type, these early cataracts or 'jack in the box' were a simple tumbling box: a wooden box on a pivot was filled with water through an adjustable cock. When the box was filled sufficiently to overbalance, the engine's injection valve would be triggered.  Watt  Boulton and Watt used the simple tumbling box design of cataract for some years afterwards, to around 1779. After this other designs were used, including a water cataract where the same water was used and recycled continuously and also an air cataract using a circular bellows. An air cataract of this type was supplied for the Ale and Cakes Mine. The plunger pump design of cataract had appeared in Cornwall by 1785, but was not Watt's invention.  Later cataracts  The term 'cataract' became a synonym for dashpot, at least where this was associated with steam engines and their governors. They were used as a damping device to avoid over-sensitivity with centrifugal governors. Cataracts were also used as an over-speed safety device for direct-acting water pumps. A seesaw or 'differential' lever was placed between the pump's piston rod and a cataract adjusted for the pump's normal working speed. If the pump suddenly accelerated, owing to the pump bursting or similar, the piston would overtake the cataract and the action of the differential lever would then close the pump's steam inlet valve and stop the pump, limiting possible damage.  Open loop control  The cataract, like most regulators, is an example of a servomechanism. However unlike the better- known Watt centrifugal governor, this is an open-loop, rather than closed-loop control. The cataract runs at its own speed, but does not measure the resultant speed of the engine. The cataract has also been described as a 'water clock'. This assumes that the relationship between the cataract's operation and the engine's speed is fixed, which is a valid assumption for a beam engine as the cataract controls the timing of the engine's stroke, rather than a variable power or throttle valve. Where a governor controls such a throttle valve, as for the Watt governor, the speed of the engine depends on a complex and unpredictable relation between the engine load, the valve position and the varying efficiency of the engine. Such governors must use a closed- loop control if they are to maintain an effective and precise regulation.  Synchronisation  One advantage of the independent and open loop nature of the cataract's control was that two engines could be adjusted to run in synchronisation, but in antiphase. With pumping engines, this gave a more even output to their pumping.  Centrifugal governor  Although the centrifugal governor was already known from its use for water- and windmills, it was not until 1788 when Watt was the first to apply it to a steam engine. This was the 'Lap Engine', an early rotative engine now preserved in the Science Museum, London. With a rotative engine, it was necessary to control the rate at which an engine moved throughout its stroke, not merely to vary the timing between strokes. This required the use of a throttle valve in the steam supply, controlled by the governor. As the load on mill engines and similar uses could vary, closed-loop control such as the engine speed-based centrifugal governor was also needed. The cataract was thus not used on rotative engines, not even where single-acting Cornish winding engines were still used in Cornwall. Cornish engines were not amenable to control by a throttle valve, as their operating cycle depended on the condensation time more than a throttled steam supply. Non-rotative beam engines also had no easy means to drive a centrifugal governor. For these reasons the cataract remained in service for as long as the Cornish engine did.'Victoria' Pumping Engine, East London Waterworks,  Notes  References  Steam engine governors Cornish engines Beam engines ","title":"Cataract (beam engine)"},{"id":"36074483","text":"Ventola is a surname.

He was a right‚Äìwinger in Real Madrid's youth teams and represented victorious Spain teams in the 1973 and 1975 editions of the World University Games. After obtaining his coaching certificate, he was Spain's assistant coach at the 1979 World University Games and spent a period in charge of Tercera Divisi√≥n club CD M√≥stoles. Coaching career The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) appointed Quereda as women's national team coach in 1988, a position he has held since, which makes him one of the longest serving football national coaches. This has led to criticisms to the RFEF of indifference for the women's national team. Under his management the Spanish team has qualified for the European Championships in 1997 and 2013. In 2014, the team qualified for their first World Cup after defeating Romania 2-0 in qualifiers. He also led the national Under-19 squad to a win in the 2004 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship. In May 2011 Laura del R√≠o, a striker with 40 goals in 39 caps for Spain, said that she would never play for the national team again while Quereda was still in charge. According to del R√≠o, many other players had also refused to play for Quereda. As an RFEF official, in 2009 he launched a controversial reform of the Superliga Femenina, expanding it from 16 to 24 teams in a two-stages three-groups format despite the opposition of most teams and players in the championship.Quarrel because of the new Superliga.

Anzald√∫a and illustrated by Consuelo M√©ndez Castillo. It is loosely based on Anzald√∫a's early life in South Texas and tells the story of a young Chicana girl, Prietita, living near the US-Mexican border who befriends and helps a young Mexican boy, Joaqu√≠n, who has recently immigrated.  Context and themes In the United States in the 1990s there was a rise in bilingual books for children and young adults which began with the publication of translated stories originally written in English, but then an increase in books that \\"deal with young people's questions about living in two cultures simultaneously and the process of developing a personal identity in that situation.\\" Taran C. Johnston included Friends from the Other Side/ Amigos del Otro Lado in an article he wrote on transculturation (which describe the phenomenon of merging and converging cultures) in bilingual children's literature as a form of resistance literature. In publishing bilingual children's books that combine two cultures in a process of transculturation and telling the stories of marginalized groups, these books may be seen as resistance to the dominant culture. According to Johnston, \\"...children's stories are frequently the channel through which an imperial power exerts its cultural influence.\\" Frances Ann Day, in Latina and Latino Voices in Literature: Lives and Works discusses several issues which are raised in Friends from the Other Side/ Amigos del Otro Lado. These include the poverty that Joaqu√≠n and his mother experience, the creation of the protagonist as a courageous, strong, young Latina girl, which challenges the dominant stereotypes often imposed on Latinas, and bullying - \\"By Prietita's example, the reader learns how to resist peer pressure and take a stand against prejudice and cruelty.\\"  Story and pictures = Opening pages The title page illustration portrays a barren yard outside a small shack in the desert where laundry hangs to dry on a line and animals roam with no fence. The next page is illustrated with a desert scene with plants and animals. The text, written in English on one page and Spanish on the facing page, is an introduction by Anzald√∫a. :In English it reads: \\"I grew up in South Texas, close to the Rio Grande river which is the Mexican-U.S. border. When I was a young girl, I saw many women and children who had crossed to this side to get work because there was none in Mexico. Many of them got wet while crossing the river, so some people on this side who didn't like them called them 'wetbacks' or 'mojados.' This is the story of Prietita, a brave young Mexican American girl, and her new friend Joaquin, a Mexican boy from the other side of the river.\\" -Gloria Anzald√∫a  Summary  The protagonist, a young girl called Prietita, is playing in her yard when a boy, Joaqu√≠n, walks by selling firewood. The two begin to talk and she notices that the Spanish he speaks is different from what she speaks. She asks if he is from the other side of the river. She also notices that his clothes are dirty and worn and he has sores on his arms. She thinks about bringing him to the curandera, an herbalist who heals people. But when she sees his sores, Joaqu√≠n feels embarrassed and hurries away. Later she hears a commotion and on investigation comes across her cousin and his friends yelling at Joaqu√≠n and calling him racist names. Prietita protects him from the other boys. She then goes with Joaquin to his home where she meets his mother who talks about crossing the border in search of work and finding the same problems on the U.S. side. Prietita offers to help her find work. One day when Joaquin is visiting Prietita, a neighbor calls out that the Border Patrol is in the area. They run to his shack, alert his mother, then the three of them go to the curandera for help. Joaquin and his mother then hide until the border patrol leave. The curandera invites Prietita to gather herbs from her garden and offers to teach her how to prepare them to heal Joaqu√≠n's sores. She also invites Prietita to become her apprentice. Reception Rose Trevino of the School Library Journal says: \\"...this is an important book for libraries in border states as it touches on timely and sensitive issues.\\" Kirkus Reviews calls it \\"An authentic portrayal; an excellent basis for discussion of an important issue.\\"  Author  As a young Chicana growing up in South Texas, Anzald√∫a suffered discrimination because her family was poor and Mexican. Living near the Rio Grande, Anzald√∫a saw many women and children who had crossed the border to search for work and these experiences influenced the writing of \\"Friends from the Other Side\\" and inspired her to tell of life in the borderlands. \\"She imprinted her heroine, Prietita, as a 'bridge'- a way of transforming the world. For Anzald√∫a, writing books for children was an important step of activism because children would effect necessary cultural and social transformations.\\" Anzald√∫a is well known for her semi-autobiographical book Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza in which she describes the effects of the border on every aspect of mestizo life: social, emotional, psychological, etc. In Friends from the Other Side/ Amigos del Otro Lado, she attempts to make her experience and knowledge in Chicano theory accessible to children. Anzald√∫a later moved to Santa Cruz, California where she worked as a professor at University of California, Santa Cruz. She was a scholar of Chicano cultural theory, feminist theory, and queer theory. She died on May 15, 2004, due to complications with diabetes.  Illustrator  Consuelo M√©ndez Castillo is an artist from Caracas, Venezuela who spent a large part of her early life in South Texas and later moved to San Francisco to study art. She was one of the original three women in the Bay Area muralist team, Mujeres Muralistas who painted several murals that depicted aspects of Latino life, injustices, and social issues and was part of the artistic movement Mission muralismo. Castillo is a widely exhibited artist in Latin America and has illustrated several children's books including Friends from the Other Side/ Amigos del Otro Lado and Atariba and Niguayona: A Story from the Taino People of Puerto Rico (Tales of the Americas).

The stone hits a small baby on the forehead; the mother threatens to call the police but on hearing of Aur√©lie's project agrees to let her look after the baby, named Herbert, and have him returned to her a week later... Sylvie Dupont - Aur√©lie's best friend, she is looking for a husband; to aid her in her task she has taken a different job each day in order to meet as many as possible having read that the most common way to meet a life partner is in the workplace. One such job is driving tourists around Paris in a 2CV. Lucien - like Sylvie, he is also looking for a life partner; he only has eyes for Japanese girls though and hence has learnt the language and is acting as a translator for Japanese tourists. The Akiyamas are a Japanese couple on holiday in Paris leaving their grown up son and daughter, Toshiro and Akiko home in Japan. They have booked an afternoon with Sylvie in the 2CV with their translator Lucien.

The film centers around Kaz Suyeishi, a woman in her late fifties who begins to reminisce about her earlier years living in Hiroshima, Japan during the aftermath of the atomic bombing. Inspired by her story, the filmmakers reached out to Mrs. Suyeishi in order to produce her biopic using computer animation and hand-drawn techniques. The official trailer was released on July 30, 2012. Since October 2012, the film has been screened at the Japanese American National Museum, Vietnamese International Film Festival, Wing Luke Museum in Seattle, Dragon Con in Atlanta, University of Michigan, UCLA, UC Irvine, UC San Diego, San Diego State University, UC Davis, UC Riverside, DisOrient Film Festival, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìLa Crosse, and California State University, Fullerton. Hibakusha received the Special Achievement Award and Best Animated Short in 2013 at the International Uranium Film Festival held in Rio de Janeiro. Plot Kaz Suyeishi (Anna Cheung), a Japanese woman in her late fifties, finds herself reminiscing and reliving every minute of the events leading up to the bombing and decimation of her beloved hometown Hiroshima. Set in early August ‚Äò85, exactly 40 years since the destruction, a local television station reaches out to Kaz while on a peace promotion tour in New York City to tell her inspirational childhood story. Once she accepts the invitation to speak on television, Kaz goes to the station the next evening and engages in a very tense conversation with the news anchor (played by Kato Cooks, who along with Timothy Tau also executive produced) and stern pilot, Paul Tibbets (played by William Frederick Knight) of the infamous Enola Gay. As Kaz begins to relive and play out the tragic events involving her family and friends, played by Daisuke Suzuki, Jane Lui, and Paul Dateh, her flashbacks guide us through an intense roller coaster of vivid imagery and uncanny reality. Inspiration Kaz Suyeishi speaks about Hiroshima. The film was inspired by the true story of Hiroshima atomic bomb survivor and Nguyen's close friend, Kaz Suyeishi. Through various tours and visits that Kaz made in the Southern California area, Nguyen took extensive notes during her lectures and wrote a screenplay loosely based on four different incidents that took place from 1945 to 1985 during Suyeishi's early life in Hiroshima and present day status. Suyeishi died on June 12, 2017 at the age of 90. The characters were visually modeled after Nguyen's closest friends and family members. Through computer animation, Belen utilized specialized graphic design techniques and 3-D implementation to orchestrate the illustrations. Each drawing was replicated as a graphic cut out which was then edited to simulate dynamic movements. The film drew particular inspiration from the war reenactment scene in Richard E. Robbin's award winning documentary Operation Homecoming: Writing the Wartime Experience as well as the Ari Folman Golden Globe Award winning animated documentary, Waltz with Bashir.

After winning the TED prize in 2011, JR expressed his wish to ‚Äúchange the world‚Äù by turning it 'inside out'. With the $100,000, from the TED Prize JR set about achieving this by giving the power of representation back to the people. The project, inspired by JR's large-format street pastings, is open to anyone to participate in, anywhere in the world. The idea behind it is to place emphasis on the people and their stories behind each action or cause. Apart from the printing of portraits, participants have full control of both the creative process (taking their pictures) and the pasting process (the installation of the posters). By using strictly black- and-white portraits, which are printed and then pasted in an exterior space, each group action can make a statement in the form of a public artwork and share their message with the rest of the world.See ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù and \\"Participate\\" on http://www.insideoutproject.net/fr/about Every Inside Out group action is documented, archived, and exhibited on the project's website.See ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù page of http://www.insideoutproject.net/fr/map As of June 2015, over 1,200 group actions had taken place, and nearly 160,000 posters had been printed and shipped to more than 127 countries.See ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù page of http://www.insideoutproject.net/fr/map The Inside Out Project has traveled from Ecuador to Nepal, from Mexico to Palestine, inspiring group actions on varied themes such as hope, diversity, violence awareness, and climate change.

The posters were pasted in the communities of the outer boroughs, in Times Square itself, and citywide. Nearly 6,000 posters were printed. Inside Out 11M Another photo booth action was Inside Out 11M, a nationwide initiative aimed at creating a portrait of America that spoke for the 11 million undocumented immigrants inhabiting the United States. Inside Out 11M aimed to represent the diversity and unity of people that call America home, reminding us that behind the numbers are real human stories. From July 16 to October 8, 2013, both the East and West coast trucks visited 20 different cities across the country. \\"Au Panth√©on!\\", Paris, France Au Panth√©on!‚ÄúJardonnet Emmanuelle, ‚ÄúJR fait entrer 4 000 anonymes au Panth√©on‚Äù, 3 juin 2014, lemonde.fr ‚Äúhttp://www.lemonde.fr/culture/video/2014/06/03/jr-fait-entrer-4-000-anonymes- au-pantheon_4431375_3246.html In France, the Center of National Monuments collaborated with the Inside Out Project for a special, patriotic installation that would wrap around the Panth√©on, Paris.

Over 12 schools have participated so far and 1807 portraits have been printed since May 2014. Official Poster for Inside Out film The Process Being a global participatory art project makes it easy for anyone around the world to participate, and it does not take much to get started. In order to begin this process, one may create an account on the website for the Inside Out Project. After that is completed, one may submit a group action: motivation can come from wanting to spread joy and celebrate life or protesting a serious issue in a community. There must be at least 5 participants/models in a group action. The action needs make a statement about a cause or a message. The group leader must then send the portraits to the Inside Out studio, which will mail back 36x53 black-and-white posters for the participants to post in a public location of their choice. The exact rules of submitting a group action can be found in the Group Action Guidelines.http://www.insideoutproject.net/sites/all/themes/insideout/documents/Group_Action_Guidelines.pdf  Film  A film documenting the project, Inside Out: The People's Art Project was selected as an official Documentary Feature Spotlight at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival, where the film premiered in Chelsea, New York City. The film then debuted exclusively on HBO in the US, where it is still available. The film was directed by Alistair Siddons and produced by Emile Abinal.

The name derives from \\"tradition\\" in its technical sense as a translation of the Arabic word hadith. It is also sometimes referred to by several other names. Adherents of traditionalist theology believe the zahir (literal, apparent) meaning of the Qur'an and the hadith are the sole authorities in matters of belief and law; and that the use of rational disputation is forbidden, even if in verifying the truth. They engage in an apparent reading of the Qur'an, as opposed to one engaged in ‚Äòmetaphorical interpretation‚Äô (ta'wil). They affirm the meanings of the attributes of Allah, but believe that their modalities(kayfiyyah) should be consigned to God alone.In essence, the text of the Qur'an and Hadith is accepted without asking \\"how\\" (i.e. \\"Bi-la kayfa\\"). Traditionalist theology emerged among hadith scholars who eventually coalesced into a movement called ahl al-hadith under the leadership of Ahmad ibn Hanbal (b. 780‚Äìd. 855). In matters of faith, they were pitted against Mu'tazilites and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrine as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them. In the tenth century al-Ash'ari and al-Maturidi found a middle ground between Mu'tazilite rationalism and Hanbalism , using the rationalistic methods championed by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the traditionalist doctrine.; While Ash'arism and Maturidism came to be known as the Sunni \\"orthodoxy\\", traditionalist Athari theology is the creed of the earliest Muslims,This is the view of academics who have focused on Muslim creed, eg Makdisi and Van Ess and is the position held by serious historians of theology within the Muslim tradition as well. and remained the creed of the majority of the Muslims(the sawaad al a'dham) until the rise of the aforementioned kalam based schools in the 4th/5th century, often through state patronage, like the case of the Nidhamiyyah madressahs that spread Ash'arism. In the modern era, Athari/Hanbali theology has had a disproportionate impact on Islamic theology, having been appropriated by Wahhabi and other traditionalist Salafi currents and spread well beyond the confines of the Hanbali school of law.  Terminology  Several terms are used to refer to traditionalist theology. They are used inconsistently and some of them have been subject to criticism. The term traditionalist theology is derived from the word \\"tradition\\" in its technical meaning as translation of the Arabic term hadith.; This term is found in a number of reference works.; ; ; ; ; It has been criticized by Marshall Hodgson (who preferred the term Hadith folk) for its potential for confusion between the technical and common meanings of the word \\"tradition\\". Oliver Leaman also cautions against misinterpreting the terms \\"traditionalists\\" and \\"rationalists\\" as implying that the former favored irrationality or that the latter did not use hadith. Some authors reject the use of these terms as labels for groups of scholars and prefer to speak of \\"traditionalist\\" and \\"rationalist\\" tendencies instead. Racha el Omari has used \\"traditionalist theology\\" in a way that includes Ash'arism and Maturidism. The term traditionism has also been used in the same sense,; although Binyamin Abrahamov reserves the term \\"traditionists\\" for scholars of hadith, distinguishing it from traditionalism as a theological current. Since the overwhelming majority of the Hanbali school of jurisprudence has adhered to traditionalist theology, some sources refer to it as Hanbali theology.; However, others note that some Shafi'i scholars also belonged to this theological movement, while some Hanbalites adopted a more rationalist theology.; Athari (from the Arabic word athar, meaning \\"remnant\\" or \\"narrative\\") is another term that has been used for traditionalist theology.; The term ahl al-hadith (people of hadith) theology is used by some authors in the same sense as athari, while others restrict it to the early stages of this movement, or use it in a broader sense to denote particular enthusiasm towards hadith. Some authors refer to traditionalist theology as classical Salafism or classic Salafiya (from salaf, meaning \\"(pious) ancestors\\").; Henri Lauzi√®re has argued that, while the majority Hanbali creed was sometimes identified as \\"salafi\\" in classical-era sources, using the corresponding nouns in this context is anachronistic. History Traditionalist theology emerged toward the end of the 8th century CE among scholars of hadith who held the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only acceptable sources of law and creed. At first these scholars formed minorities within existing religious study circles, but by the early ninth century they coalesced into a separate traditionalist movement (commonly called ahl al-hadith) under the leadership of Ahmad ibn Hanbal. In legal matters, these traditionalists criticized the use of personal opinion (ra'y) common among the Hanafi jurists of Iraq as well as the reliance on living local traditions by Malikite jurists of Medina. They also rejected the use of qiyas (analogical deduction) and other methods of jurisprudence not based on literal reading of scripture. In matters of faith, traditionalists were pitted against Mu'tazilites and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrines as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them. Traditionalists were also characterized by their avoidance of all state patronage and by their social activism. They attempted to follow the injunction of \\"commanding good and forbidding evil\\" by preaching asceticism and launching vigilante attacks to break wine bottles, musical instruments and chessboards. In 833 the caliph al-Ma'mun tried to impose Mu'tazilite theology on all religious scholars and instituted an inquisition (mihna) which required them to accept the Mu'tazilite doctrine that the Qur'an was a created object, which implicitly made it subject to interpretation by caliphs and scholars.; Ibn Hanbal led traditionalist resistance to this policy, affirming under torture that the Quran was uncreated. Although Mu'tazilism remained state doctrine until 851, the efforts to impose it only served to politicize and harden the theological controversy. The next two centuries saw an emergence of broad compromises in both law and creed within Sunni Islam. In jurisprudence, Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali madhhabs all gradually came to accept both the traditionalist reliance on the Quran and hadith and the use of controlled reasoning in the form of qiyas. In theology, Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (874-936) found a middle ground between Mu'tazilite rationalism and Hanbalite literalism, using the rationalistic methods championed by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the traditionalist doctrine. A rival compromise between rationalism and traditionalism emerged from the work of al-Maturidi (d. c. 944), and one of these two schools of theology was accepted by members of all Sunni madhhabs, with the exception of most Hanbalite and some Shafi'i scholars, who ostensibly persisted in their rejection of kalam, although they often resorted to rationalistic arguments themselves, even while claiming to rely on the literal text of scripture. The Athari approach to faith remained influential among the urban masses in some areas, particularly in Baghdad.; Its popularity manifested itself repeatedly from late ninth to eleventh centuries, when crowds shouted down preachers who publicly expounded rationalistic theology. After caliph al-Mutawakkil suspended the rationalist inquisition, Abbasid caliphs came to rely on an alliance with traditionalists to buttress popular support. In the early 11th century the caliph al-Qadir made a series of proclamations that sought to prevent public preaching of rationalistic theology. In turn, the Seljuq vizier Nizam al-Mulk in the late 11th century encouraged Ash'ari theologians in order to counterbalance caliphal traditionalism, inviting a number of them to preach in Baghdad over the years. One such occasion led to five months of rioting in the city in 1077. While Ash'arism and Maturidism are often called the Sunni \\"orthodoxy\\", traditionalist theology has thrived alongside it, laying rival claims to be the orthodox Sunni faith.: \\"The Ash‚Äòari school of theology is often called the Sunni ‚Äòorthodoxy.‚Äô But the original ahl al-hadith, early Sunni creed from which Ash‚Äòarism evolved has continued to thrive alongside it as a rival Sunni ‚Äòorthodoxy‚Äô as well.\\" In the modern era it has had a disproportionate impact on Islamic theology, having been appropriated by Wahhabi and other traditionalist Salafi currents and spread well beyond the confines of the Hanbali school of law. Beliefs=On the Qur'an The Atharis believe that the Qur'an is uncreated (ghayr makhluq).Christopher Melchert, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Oneworld Publ., 2006, p 154 It is reported that Ahmad Ibn Hanbal said, \\"The Qur'an is God's Speech, which He expressed; it is uncreated. He who claims the opposite is a Jahmite, an infidel. And he who says, 'The Qur'an is God's Speech,' and stops there without adding 'uncreated,' speaks even more abominably than the former\\". On Kalam and human reason For Atharis, the validity of human reason is limited, and rational proofs cannot be trusted nor relied upon in matters of belief, thus making kalam a blameworthy innovation. Rational proofs, unless they are Qur'anic in origin, are considered nonexistent and wholly invalid. However, this was not always the case as a number of Atharis delved into kalam, whether or not they described it as such. Examples of Atharis who wrote books against the use of kalam and human reason include the Hanbali Sufi Khwaja Abdullah Ansari, and the Hanbali jurist Ibn Qudama. Ibn Qudama harshly rebuked kalam as one of the worst of all heresies. He characterized its partisans, its theologians, as innovators and heretics who had betrayed and deviated from the simple and pious faith of the early Muslims. He writes: \\"The theologians are intensely hated in this world, and they will be tortured in the next. None among them will prosper, nor will he succeed in following the right direction...\\". On the Attributes of God The Atharis staunchly affirm the existence of the attributes of God and consider all of them to be equally eternal. They accept the relevant verses of the Qur'an and hadith as they are, without subjecting them to rational analysis or elaboration. According to Atharis, the modality(kayfiyyah), which can be thought of as the actual reality of the attributes of God should be consigned to God alone .According to this method, one should adhere to the sacred text of the Qur'an and believe that it is the truth, without trying to explain it through a figurative explanation.BinyƒÅm√Æn Abraham, Anthropomorphism and Interpretation of the Qur'an in the Theology of Al-Qasim Ibn Ibrahim: Kitab Al-Mustarshid (Islamic Philosophy, Theology and Science). , p 6. Ahmed Ibn Hanbal reportedly stated, \\"His Attributes proceed from Him and are His own, we do not go beyond the Qur'an and the traditions of the Prophet and his Companions; nor do we know the how of these, save by the acknowledgment of the Apostle and the confirmation of the Qur'an\\". Imam Ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-Barr al Maliki al Athari (rA) said, \\"The people of al-Sunnah unanimously agree on the affirmation of all the attributes that are in the Quran and the Sunnah and their being literal (·∏•aqeeqah), not metaphorical (maj√¢z), but they do not ascribe a modality to any of that and do not qualify them by a particular limiting description. As for the people of innovation, the Jahmiyyah, all of the Mu‚Äòtazilah, and the Kharijites, they all deny them and do not accept them as literal, and claim that those who accept them are anthropomorphists; and they are, to those who affirm them, negators of the worshiped Lord. The truth is in what the affirmers have said about what is stated in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, and they are the imams of the Jam√¢‚Äòah (the mainstream group), and to Allah is all praise. Anthropomorphism was commonly alleged against Athari scholars by their critics, including the Hanbalite scholar and theologian Ibn al-Jawzi. In some cases, Athari scholars espoused extreme anthropomorphic views, but they do not generally represent the Athari movement as a whole. On Iman (faith) The Atharis hold that Iman (faith) increases and decreases in correlation with the performance of prescribed rituals and duties, such as the five daily prayers.Herbert W. Mason, Humaniora Islamica, Volume 1, p 123. They believe that Iman resides in the heart, in the utterance of the tongue and in the action of the limbs. On division of tawhid Some scholars of the Athari school of divinity supported the division of tawhid into three categories; tawhid al-rububiyyah (\\"the oneness of lordship\\", referring to belief in God as the creator and sustainer of the world) and tawhid al-uluhiyyah (\\"the oneness of divinity\\", referring to worshipping God as the only deity) and tawhid al-asma wa-l-sifat (\\"the oneness of names and attributes\\", which asserts that God has only one set of attributes and they do not contradict each other). Ibn Taymiyyah seems to have been the first to introduce this distinction., however it is built up from earlier authorities who made similar classifications, like the Hanbali scholar Ibn Battah al- Ukbari. Criticism Sixteenth-century Sunni scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami, who belonged to the Ashari school of kalam, criticised Athari views associated with Ibn Taymiyyah.

He is the founding and managing partner of the South Florida-based firm Herman Law, and has been described in the media as \\"the nation's leading attorney when it comes to handling high-profile sexual abuse lawsuits\\". Herman gained substantial publicity for bringing cases against alleged sexual predators and institutions that protect them. He has been featured in The New York Times, USA Today, Forbes, People, and New York magazine and is a contributor to The O'Reilly Factor, MSNBC, and CNN. He is best known for exposing the clergy sexual abuse scandal in the Archdiocese of Miami and the Archdiocese of Denver, Herman is also noted for his landmark $100 million verdict on behalf of a client who was sexually abused by Rev. Neil Doherty, one of the largest verdicts ever against an individual priest. He has also represented clients against public figures, including financier Jeffrey Epstein, puppeteer Kevin Clash, and director Bryan Singer. By 2015, Herman stated that he had litigated more than 800 cases in the field. Early life, education, and career Born and raised in Youngstown, Ohio, Herman attended the University of Arizona, and received a J.D. from Case Western Reserve University School of Law in 1985, where he was on the editorial board of the Canada-United States Law Journal.Canada-United States Law journal, Volumes 9 (1985), p. ii. He began practicing law in Florida in 1985, and \\"was a successful commercial lawyer before he shifted exclusively to sexual-abuse\\". In one case during this period, in 1995, Herman successfully represented Robin Elkins, a saxophonist who had patented a means of storing and retrieving bits of sound on a computer, a technology that led to electronic voice mail.Vicki McCash, \\"Creators Must Guard Inventions\\", South Florida Sun Sentinel (August 7, 1995), Weekly Business section, p. 1, 8. Sexual abuse cases=Cases in religious and educational settings Herman's specialization in sexual abuse cases began with a 1997 case against Nova Southeastern University, which has failed to conduct a background check on a convicted child sex offender who had volunteered for a program run by the school, and who had molested an autistic child there. Herman credited the shift to a search for meaning that has been fulfilled by seeking justice for victims of abuse. Herman first gained national attention in this field representing victims of clergy sexual abuse in over 100 cases against the Archdiocese of Miami. In 2003, he represented the victim in the first sexual abuse lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Miami allowed to go to trial. For years, the Catholic Church was able to have sexual abuse cases dismissed on statute of limitations technicalities. Herman became one of the first attorneys to successfully defeat this strategy- arguing that the archdiocese committed fraud by keeping a priest's sexual abuse history secret. In 2004, Herman represented the victims of Rev. Alvaro Guichard, a Catholic priest accused of sexually abusing four children in the 1970s. Guichard unexpectedly crashed a news conference held by Herman and the family of one of Guichard's deceased victims following the filing of the lawsuit. The priest confronted the family, calling them liars and while grabbing the brother of the victim's arm. Herman was able to pull Guichard off of the brother just before police arrived on the scene. Following the incident, Guichard filed a suit against Herman, claiming he defamed him when he accused him of rape and sodomy. In 2012, the defamation suit was dismissed by the Miami-Dade Circuit Court. In the early 2000s, Herman tried his first cases regarding abuse of Native Americans under the authority of a Catholic diocese. It was reported at the time that \\"Herman is known nationally as a plaintiff's lawyer in clergy sexual abuse cases, but his reputation in Indian law circles is less established\\". In 2006, Herman represented an alleged victim of Anthony Mercieca, the priest accused of molesting U.S. congressman Mark Foley. The lawsuit alleged that Mercieca fondled and performed oral sex on the victim, who was a 13-year-old altar boy at St. James Church in North Miami. The suit sought $10 million in damages and settled in 2007 for an undisclosed amount. That same year, Herman represented the victims of Rabbi Joel Kolko, who was accused of molesting multiple young students of his yeshiva. The case was the first lawsuit against a Jewish leader to be filed following the Catholic Church sex abuse scandal. In 2007, Herman represented the alleged victim of Don Walk, the former Miami Dolphins team chaplain. Walk allegedly took the boy to Dolphins games, introduced him to players, and brought him to the house of coach Don Shula while grooming the boy for abuse. In 2011, Herman won a $100 million verdict for a victim of Father Neil Doherty, a priest of the Archdiocese of Miami accused of drugging and raping church youths. The result was the nation's largest jury verdict for a sexual abuse case in 2011 and one of the year's top 20 verdicts overall. Herman ‚Äì along with attorneys Adam Horowitz and Arick Fudali ‚Äì won a $3 million jury verdict on behalf of a young girl who was sexually abused at Discovery Day Care in 2012. Testimony showed that the preschooler was abused on multiple occasions by the daycare director's 13-year-old son and that a center employee falsified documents related to the incident. In 2014, Herman won a $5.25 million verdict for a boy in a sexual abuse lawsuit against Charter Schools USA. The verdict is believed to be among the highest ever in a charter school sexual abuse case.David Smiley, \\"Jury awards $5.25 million to boy in Downtown Miami Charter School sex assault case\\", Miami Herald, 2014-04-15 In 2019, Herman represented New York clergy sex abuse victims in a lawsuit against the Vatican and Pope Francis, contending negligence in addressing misconduct within the priesthood. Celebrity cases Herman represented several teenage victims of financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2008. Epstein was convicted of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. Herman filed a civil suit alleging that the victims were as young as 14 years old when they were brought to Epstein's mansion to perform erotic massages. The suit sought $50 million in damages and eventually settled for an undisclosed amount. Throughout 2012 and 2013, Herman represented five alleged victims of Elmo puppeteer, Kevin Clash. On November 20, 2012, Herman filed a lawsuit alleging that Clash sexually abused a 15-year-old boy he met on a gay phone chatline. Clash publicly resigned from Sesame Street later that day. While discussing the sexual abuse lawsuits he filed against Clash, Herman told The Baltimore Sun it has been his goal to \\"listen to sexual abuse victims and give them a voice\\". Herman also filed lawsuits on behalf of two plaintiffs against X-Men director, Bryan Singer, the first in 2014, and the second in 2017. The plaintiff in the first case, Michael Egan, was a former child model and actor who accused Singer of repeatedly drugging, threatening and forcibly sodomizing him in the late 1990s, beginning when the boy was 15 years old. \\"Hollywood has a problem with the sexual exploitation of children. This is the first of many cases I will be filing to give these victims a voice and to expose the issue\\", Herman said in a statement shortly after filing. Herman filed another series of lawsuits against three more Hollywood executives: former Fox television executive Garth Ancier, theater producer Gary Wayne Goddard and former television executive David A. Neuman. However, within months all four lawsuits were dropped after Egan's stories continued to change and the cases began to fall apart. Herman withdrew from representing Egan, and he and another former attorney of Egan's, Mark Gallagher, wrote letters of apology to Ancier and Neuman. Herman's letter stated that he had learned that he had \\"participated in making what I now know to be untrue and proveably false allegations\\"; accompanying the letters were an undisclosed seven-figure sum. The following year, Egan was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to unrelated fraud charges. The plaintiff in the second case, Cesar Sanchez-Guzman, filed a lawsuit in the state of Washington against Singer, alleging that he had been raped at age 17 by the director in 2003. Singer denied the allegations and removed himself from the public eye. In June 2019, Singer agreed to pay $150,000 to settle the case, which was approved by Sanchez-Guzman's bankruptcy trustee Nancy James, citing the absence of evidence that Singer attended the yacht party where the alleged assault took place. Singer's attorney Andrew Brettler said that Singer has maintained his innocence and that the \\"decision to resolve the matter with the bankruptcy trustee was purely a business one\\". In 2015, Herman wrote an op-ed piece for Reuters about bringing down powerful men accused of rape. In the piece, he said the role of the internet in sexual abuse cases is changing and it can play a positive, equalizing role enabling victims to come forward and speak up in support of others.  Controversies  In 2012, Herman's pursuit of a case against a rabbi stirred controversy, with participants in various internet forums asserting that Herman, as an observant Jew, was \\"bringing unwarranted shame on the Orthodox community\\". Advocates for various defendants sued by clients represented by Herman have complained that Herman has sought personal publicity through his cases. In 2012, the Archdiocese of Miami criticized press conferences held by Herman as not providing the full truth to the news media. In 2015, Bryan Singer's attorney criticized Herman for holding a press conference regarding that case, accusing Herman of \\"seeking to get his 15 minutes of fame\\" and saying \\"Attorneys who try cases don't hold press conferences\\". Entertainment lawyer Jonathan Handel, who wrote a number of articles defending Singer, wrote in a 2017 piece in The Hollywood Reporter that Herman was disciplined for two incidents of misconduct involving dishonesty, including a 1998 incident in which an Oregon District Court had reportedly barred Herman permanently from his courtroom following findings of alleged misrepresentations and dishonesty. Handel further wrote that, also in 1998, Herman had been accused of sexual battery by his then 19-year-old receptionist, who had accompanied Herman back to his apartment while Herman was separated from his wife. Handel reported that the police had referred that case to the District Attorney, and it was thereafter dropped for insufficient evidence. Handel also asserted that between 2014 and 2017, Herman was the debtor in four federal tax liens (from $210,000 to over $900,000), and that two major banks had also filed claims against the attorney for credit due, and foreclosure. Recognition In 2013, Jeff Herman was named \\"Child Advocate of the Year\\" by KidSafe Foundation during their 4th Annual Fundraiser. In reporting the award, the Observer noted that Herman has been \\"recognized for his unique child forensic interviewing technique, and he trains professionals from various child welfare organizations on how to help sexually abused children heal through disclosure\\". He has been referred to in the media as the \\"Dark Knight\\", fighting for the most vulnerable victims. Herman has also been referred to as the \\"legal eagle\\" and the \\"Go-To-Guy\\" for sexual abuse lawsuits. While on MSNBC discussing the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal, Herman coined the term \\"pedophile speak\\", describing the way pedophiles talk about and justify abusing children. While discussing the sexual abuse lawsuits he filed against Kevin Clash, Herman told The Baltimore Sun it has been his goal to \\"listen to sexual abuse victims and give them a voice\\". In an op-ed piece for Reuters about bringing down powerful men accused of rape, Herman said the role of the internet in sexual abuse cases is changing and it can play a positive, equalizing role enabling victims to come forward and speak up in support of others.  Personal life  Herman is a practicing Jew and father of four. In 2008, the Miami Herald profiled Herman and reported on his greatest weakness: red meat. He has a favorite steakhouse in every city, never deviating from his order of a medium rare New York strip and a side salad. Herman is also an avid collector of wine and single malt scotch.

When this hope remained unfulfilled, he was determined to destroy the Kabah; and so he set out against Mecca at the head of a large army, which included several war elephants as well, and thus represented something hitherto unknown and utterly astounding to the Arabs: hence the designation of that year, by contemporaries as well as historians of later generations, as \\"the Year of the Elephant\\". Abrahah's army was destroyed on its march - by an extremely huge flock of martin swallow birds (ababil) that dropped tiny stones onto them and turned them to ashes. - and Abrahah himself died on his return to Sana. referencing the anecdote in a Qur'anic Surah, Al-Fil) was the codename for the military operation planned by the Pakistan Armed Forces with the intention to capture and assume absolute control over the Siachen Glacier in the disputed Kashmir region. The operation was effectively thwarted on 13 April 1984 by India's preemptive Operation Meghdoot, which resulted in Indian troops successfully gaining control of the entire glacier before Pakistan, sparking the Siachen conflict.

India was alerted to the nature of Operation Ababeel around 1983 and promptly began to organize an Indian force to preempt Pakistan's operational plans and seize control of the entire glacier, starting with the heights of Saltoro to gain a strategic edge over Pakistan in the Kashmir conflict.

Background  By the early 1890s, Francis Wilson had already developed a reputation as being an expert comedian. However in the years prior to 1900, Wilson had experienced a few unsuccessful shows. He appeared in a burlesque of Cyrano De Bergerac in September 1899 in which he played the title character. It was not well received and closed in less than a month. Already in 1897, he completed an early version of a story he called Bouloo Boulboom in which he would play the title character in broad comic style to show off his comic talents.\\"Music and Opera\\", Clipping File, Billy Rose Theatre Division. The completed first draft of the manuscript is dated November 23, 1897. The following year he lent it to J. Cheever Goodwin, who made alterations and wrote lyrics.Wilson's original handwritten script (with date of completion and date mailed to Goodwin) is in Box 8, Francis Wilson Papers, Billy Rose Theatre Division, New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Rather than repeat the failure of his previous plays such as the burlesque on Cyrano, Wilson set his story in an exotic location, providing many opportunities for broad characterizations and attractive settings.\\"Francis Wilson in a New Opera,\\" unidentified newspaper, Clipping Files, Billy Rose Theatre Division, New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The manuscript vocal score also carries this title. By the time of the first performance, the title was changed to the more recognizable Monks of Malabar. Credits for the play always listed J. Cheever Goodwin as the author; there was no mention of Wilson's authorship with the exception of his ad libbing from the stage.  Plot  Act 1: Under the Taj-Mahal in Malabar. Boolboom has fled from France to India to escape the vixenish temper of Anita Tivoli to whom he was engaged to be married. As the story opens, Boolboom has prospered as a merchant in ivory and is about to wed a native woman Tata-Lilli (\\"Hail the Groom, Hail the Bride\\"). Cocodilla enters and speaks about a wife's obligation to her husband (\\"Where He Goes, We Go Too\\"). Boolboom and the monks of Malabar confirm the customs (\\"The Monks of Malabar\\"), although Boolboom is not beyond flirting with Daru (\\"The Dear Little French Grisette\\"). Anita then puts in a very unexpected and unwelcome appearance (\\"In Gay Paree\\"). She obliges Boolboom to wed her (\\"Joseph, James and John\\"), but he determines to avail himself of \\"Article 213\\" should Anita's temper again become unbearable. Article 213 is an East Indian law obliging a woman to be burnt within 24 hours of when her husband dies. The act ends with Boolboom marrying Anita (\\"Go On and Marry!\\"). Act 2: Inside the Maharajah's Palace of Pearls. People await the arrival of the Maharajah (\\"With Keen Anticipate\\"). He enters and describes his beneficent ruling (\\"Hear! Hear!\\"). Zizibar confess her/his deep love for Cocodilla (\\"You Know That I Adore You\\"). With Anita proving incorrigible, Boolboom plans to feigns his death (\\"From Very Earliest Infancy\\"). To prevent Anita being burnt, Boolboom writes to his friend the Nabob of Malabar, asking him to sees that she gets safely away to France. The Nabob, being in love with Anita, does not carry out Boolboom's wishes (\\"On My Trim Built Craft\\"). Boolboom argues (\\"Then, If I Understand Right\\") and leaves to feign his death by having been devoured by tigers. The Nabob rescues Anita en route to the funeral pyre, hoping that her gratitude will turn into love (\\"No More Weighted Down By Sorrow\\" - Act 2 finale). Act 3: Inside the Maharajah's Palace of Domes. Zizibar, Cocodilla, Zoloe and Djelma summarize the turn of events (\\"Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!\\"). The servants present themselves to the Nabob for inspection (\\"Here We Are Sir\\"). Boolboom returns disguised as a monk but is surprised to find Anita not just alive but now being courted by the Nabob. He disguises himself again as a servant in order to separate Anita from the Nabob (\\"You assert that you adore me\\"). Additionally, Boolboom inspires the women to revolt against Article 213. He is so successful that he induces the Maharajah to sell Anita to the highest bidder. He makes a great struggle to purchase her, but is outbid by the Nabob. After much difficulty, he succeeds in rescuing Anita, and gets safely back to France with her (\\"Finale act 3\\").  Reception  Criticism leveled at The Monks of Malabar ranged from muted appreciation to distaste. William Raymond Sill wrote in the New York Evening World: \\"Theatrical history will probably record \\"The Monks of Malabar\\" as a qualified success. It is one of those affairs insufficiently bad to be wholly condemned and insufficiently good to be wholly praised. As presented at the Knockerbocker Theatre last night it struck me as being absolutely nebulous. I have reason to consider my premises well taken.\\"William Raymond Sill, \\"Wilson Clever in 'Monks of Malabar'; Englander music too ambitious,\\" New York Evening World (14 September 1900).

It serves the Framingham/Worcester Line. It is located in the Brighton neighborhood just west of the Everett Street bridge, next to the Massachusetts Turnpike. It serves the Allston-Brighton area as well as the Boston Landing development including Warrior Ice Arena. The station is fully accessible, with a single full-length high-level island platform. Elevators and stairs lead to Arthur Street and to the Everett Street bridge. The station, which was officially announced on June 7, 2012, is the result of discussions dating back to 1998. It was then projected to cost $16 million and to serve as many as 2400 daily riders by 2030. It is an infill station, since commuter rail trains passed frequently on existing tracks through the site. In November 2012, New Balance announced their intention to open the station in 2014. However, in May 2014, the expected opening was pushed back to the fall of 2016. The new station is being financed by New Balance under a public- private partnership agreement. Prior to a May 2013 renaming, the proposed station project was known as New Brighton Landing. A groundbreaking ceremony for the $20 million station was held on May 12, 2015. The station opened on May 22, 2017. History=Former stations 1847 woodcutting of the first Brighton station in Winship Gardens Brighton station in the late 1800s. The station, designed by H.H. Richardson, was demolished in 1959. The Boston and Worcester Railroad (B&W;) opened as far as West Newton in April 1834. The first intermediate station was located at Brighton; it was alternately known at first as Winship Gardens after the adjacent gardens. The small depot was located on the north side of the tracks near and probably just west of Market Street. The first train to arrive at Brighton was reportedly greeted by a celebratory cannon shot. Serving both tourists headed to the gardens and livestock dealers bound for the nearby cattle market, it quickly became one of the railroad's busiest stations. By 1850, the station generated $5,000 a week in revenues, with round-trip tickets to Boston costing just 12.5 cents. Railroads frequently built stations in rural areas on their suburban lines, hoping to attract new development and thus prompt more commuters to use their lines. A flag stop with limited service was later added at Cambridge Crossing, where what is now Cambridge Street crossed the line at grade. The name confused travelers, as the station was not particularly close to Cambridge itself; by 1850 the name \\"East Brighton\\" was proposed instead. The B&W; merged with its extension/rival, the Western Railroad, in 1867 to become the Boston and Albany Railroad (B&A;). That year, the B&A; built a wood-frame depot off Cambridge Street near Harvard Street. Wishing to further distance itself from Cambridge, the village voted in 1868 to rename itself as Allston after the painter Washington Allston. The Post Office acknowledged the name change, as did the B&A; the station was officially renamed Allston on June 1, 1868. By 1870, ridership was at double 1867 levels. The railroad had originally been built on the northern fringes of Brighton to appease residents who did not want the noise and danger of a railroad in their village center. However, as its popularity grew, so did the local regret for that choice. In 1871, residents attempted to privately finance a branch line that would split from the mainline at Allston and run to Brighton Center. From there, the branch would have either ran north to rejoin the mainline, or continued west through Oak Square and reached the main at Newton. Two surveys were carried out - the latter of which proposed to extend the branch through Newton Lower Falls to Grantville - but the branch was not built. After years of deferred investment after the Panic of 1873, the B&A; began a substantial improvement program to its suburban stations around 1879. This was likely to divert profits - capped at 10% under state law - into capital investment which would serve as an expanded base for larger profits later. Famed architect H.H. Richardson would ultimately design nine stations for the railroad before his 1886 death; his successors Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge designed an additional 23 stations by 1894. A new Brighton station was commissioned in July 1884, and construction by the Norcross Brothers firm was completed in 1885. The new station opened on July 6, 1885. Those stations, along with several others in Newton and Boston, were closed in April 1959 when much of the main line was reduced from 4 to 2 tracks during the building of the Massachusetts Turnpike. The station closures left the northern part of Brighton lacking rail service. The Brighton station was demolished during highway construction, while the Allston station remained intact. The Allston Depot Steakhouse opened in the building in 1972, followed by Sports Depot in 1988 and Regina Pizzeria in 2010. It was designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1997. Regina Pizzeria closed in July 2020; that August, Allston music venue Great Scott announced that they were in negotiations to lease the station to replace their former location. Planning a new station Allston depot, one of the station sites considered in the 2009 study, seen here in 2012 In 1998, a new station in Allston-Brighton began to be considered as part of the Urban Ring planning process. In 2007, the City of Boston allocated $500,000 in funding for the Allston Multimodal Station Study. The study analyzed both commuter rail and DMU local service along the corridor, with potential stops at Faneuil, Market Street, Everett Street, Cambridge Street, West (Ashford Street), and Commonwealth Avenue. Allston was soon determined the most likely location for an initial commuter rail stop, using either the Everett Street or Cambridge Street location, with more stops and DMU service to follow later. Local opinion was skewed towards Cambridge Street, with residents citing better bus connections and access to Union Square, plus security risks at Everett Street. The station was estimated to serve 2,000 daily riders by 2030, cost $10 million, and take ten years to actually reach completion when the recommendations were made in 2009. In 2009 and 2010, the state negotiated a major agreement with CSX Transportation that involved the purchase of several rail lines, including purchasing the line between Framingham and Worcester. The agreement also included CSX moving its intermodal freight operations from the Beacon Park Yard in Allston to a new yard in Worcester. The abandonment of Beacon Park Yards allows for an increase in MBTA service on the Framingham/Worcester Line; additionally, the elimination of the single-track bottleneck through the yard opened the possibility for a station to be built in Allston while still allowing passing tracks. However, with no funding source available, construction of a station was not pursued. In March 2012, New Balance submitted initial plans for a mixed-use development in Brighton, which included the possibility of a commuter rail station. In May, they officially announced the $500 million development, which is to be one block away from the station site. A company spokesperson told the Boston Globe that \\"If designated by MassDOT, New Brighton Landing will design, permit and construct a commuter rail station in Allston-Brighton\\" and that New Balance was willing to contribute to funding the station. Boston Landing Track work near the station site in November 2015 One June 7, 2012, Allston-Brighton officials announced that New Balance and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation had signed a letter of intent to build a station at Everett Street, to be named New Brighton Landing. The public-private partnership, in which New Balance will \\"fund all permitting, design, construction and annual maintenance costs\\" for the station - then projected to cost $16 million - was the first of its kind for the MBTA. The associated New Brighton Landing development was approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority on September 13, 2012, with construction to begin later that year. No timetable was initially laid out for station construction. On November 9, 2012, the company announced plans to open the station in 2014. Design and permitting were to be completed in 2013, with construction finished within a year. In March 2013, the names of the station and the development were changed to Boston Landing. The proposed station was approved by a MassDOT finance board on May 14, 2013, and the agency's Board of Directors on May 22. By 2013 the expected completion date had slipped to mid-2015, and in May 2014 New Balance announced that the station would not open until the second half of 2016. The company cited the unanticipated complexity of the planning and construction for the delay. A groundbreaking ceremony for the $20 million station was held on May 12, 2015, still with an expected opening in the fall of 2016. Construction began in October 2015 with the removal of the three yard tracks at the station site. The inner part of the Framingham/Worcester Line was closed for a weekend in December 2015 to allow construction of a temporary shoo-fly track, which allows the mainline track to be removed during construction. The mainline tracks were put back in service during a similar weekend shutdown in April 2017, restoring double track through Allston for the first time since the 1950s. State legislators representing communities along the Worcester Line have expressed concern that Boston Landing and the planned West Station would slow down trips for suburban commuters. It was originally proposed to limit service to the stop to two inbound trains in the morning rush hour and two outbounds in the afternoon (plus an unknown amount of off-peak service), but later draft schedules added additional stops. Boston Landing station is fully handicapped accessible, with elevators on the pedestrian bridge to Arthur Street and another elevator to the Everett Street bridge. The station opened on May 22, 2017. In April 2017, the MBTA announced that the station would be in Zone 1, which would have given suburban commuters inexpensive interzone fares but increased the cost of reaching downtown from Boston Landing. After criticism, the agency placed the station in Zone 1A. Bus connections The station is intended to connect several MBTA bus routes in Allston-Brighton.

He was British Consul at Geneva. He was a close friend of Edward Bulwer-Lytton and a member of Sir William Gell's inner circle at Naples. Life In 1805, John Auldjo was born into a prominent family of merchants and politicians at Montreal. He was the elder of the two sons of Alexander Auldjo and his wife Eweretta Jane Richardson (1774‚Äì1808), sister of John Richardson. His mother's first cousins included John Forsyth and Edward Ellice. His brother, Thomas Richardson Auldjo (1808‚Äì1837), married Anna, one of the daughters of William McGillivray and a niece of both John MacDonald of Garth and General Sir Archibald Campbell. John Auldjo was a godson of Simon McGillivray, who looked after him in London after he was orphaned at the age of sixteen. In 1822, Auldjo entered Trinity College, Cambridge. Before he embarked on his Grand Tour, he secured a place at Lincoln's Inn, London. In 1827, during the early stages of his tour, he decided to climb to the top of Mont Blanc, going with six guides. At the summit he shared a bottle of wine with the guides and then sat down to write a short letter to his sister. The letter, still preserved today and signed on the back by all six guides, is one of the most evocative items in the Archives of the Alpine Club.Archives of the Alpine Club Auldjo's 1828 written account of the ascent, with his own illustrations, was a success and ran to three editions. In 1830, he made the decision to remain in Europe by giving power of attorney over his Canadian properties to his lawyer, Thomas Kirkpatrick.Auldjo Papers in the Archives of Queen's University From then, Auldjo lived in Naples as one of the inner circle of Sir William Gell. This inner circle included Sir William Drummond, Keppel Richard Craven, Lady Blessington, Sir Walter Scott and Edward Bulwer-Lytton, who was Auldjo's particularly close friend. Lord Byron, another frequent guest at Naples, was also well known to him.John Auldjo from The Life and Times of Lord Byron In 1831, Auldjo visited Mount Vesuvius during a time of vigorous activity. He published a book on his return filled with hand-coloured lithographs of the volcano in full eruption. His investigations of Vesuvius were subsequently rewarded with Fellowships at the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society. He was Walter Scott's cicerone between January and April 1832.J.A. Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses In 1833, he toured Constantinople and the Greek Islands, publishing an account of his time there in 1835. Since 1826, when he was put forward by Simon McGillivray at London, Auldjo had been an active Freemason. In 1837, McGillivray appointed him his Deputy as Grand Master of Upper Canada, and as such in the late summer of that year he travelled there. Meanwhile, his brother who had been staying with him at Naples, died. He returned to London, and was last noted in the Freemason records as attending a meeting there in 1841-2. He then fades into obscurity and reappears in Geneva in 1870, communicating with his lawyer, Sir George Airey Kirkpatrick, regarding the Canadian property that he had made over to his deceased niece, Madeliene Auldjo (d.1858). He held the unpaid position of British Consul at Geneva from 1872 until his death in 1886. He was buried there at the Chatelaine Cemetery.J.A.

He is also rector of Saint Petersburg Mining University in St. Petersburg. Career Litvinenko has been the rector of Saint Petersburg Mining University since the 1990s. He oversaw Vladimir Putin's dissertation work in 1996, which is alleged to include significant amounts of plagiarism and is speculated perhaps to have not even been written by Putin. Litvinenko has been criticised for not spotting the alleged plagiarism. Clifford Gaddy: \\"Mr. Litvinenko -- who was directly involved in the dissertation, allegedly helped [Putin] choose the topic and was more or less the advisor for the dissertation -- is himself a member of the higher accreditation commission, which is the government-appointed body to be the watchdog over standards about degree-granting, dissertations and quality control for higher education in Russia.

Phosagro was floated on the London Stock Exchange in July 2011 and Litvinenko was listed among its new owners, as chairman. When Litvinenko owned 5%, the stock was worth about $260 million. In April 2014, he acquired a further 4.9% from Andrey Guryev, who controls the company, for $269 million. Personal life Litvinenko is married to Tatyana Petrovna Klovanich. Litvinenko has a daughter, Olga, born in 1983, who used to be a member of the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg. In May 2010 Vladimir and his wife Tatyana were looking after Olga's daughter Ester-Maria Litvinenko (born in 2009), and refused to give her back to Olga. Olga has described this as a kidnapping and has instigated legal proceedings to get her daughter back. Olga describes her father as \\"the richest rector in Russia\\" and an \\"oligarch\\" (\\"—Å–∞–º—ã–π –±–æ–≥–∞—Ç—ã–π —Ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, –æ–ª–∏–≥–∞—Ä—Ö\\").

There was no appearance for the second respondent. In terms of section 29(1) of the Close Corporations Act,Act 69 of 1984. only natural persons are permitted to be members of a close corporation, subject to certain exceptions in section 29(2)(b) and (c). In terms of s 29(2)(c), \\"a natural or juristic person, nomine officii who, in the case of a member who is insolvent, deceased, mentally disordered or otherwise incapable or incompetent to manage his affairs, is a trustee of his insolvent estate or an administrator, executor or curator in respect of such member or is otherwise a person who is his duly appointed or authorised legal representative\\" qualifies for membership. In the present case, in which a member of a close corporation was deceased, the executor of the deceased's estate qualified for membership of the corporation. The court found, however, on the plain meaning of the Act, that an executor may hold a member's interest in a close corporation only if the deceased held that member's interest at the time of his death: Only an executor of a deceased estate where the deceased was a member of the close corporation in question falls within the exception in s 29(2)(c).1271I, 1272A-B, 1272F-G.

The music video depicts a couple who rebel against the girl's father by sneaking out and running away. The video also shows a fight, but doesn't give much explaining. In the director's cut version, it is revealed that the girl's name is Marilyn, and that she didn't know the man, or his name before that day, but she doesn't want to wait for her dad to pick her up, so she goes for a drive with him. They go out and see a movie. After that, he offers to take her back home, but she insists on dropping her off at the park so her dad doesn't see him. She gets out, and begins walking across the park, when three unknown men confront her and try to attack her, tearing her shirt. All of a sudden, the man she met jumps out and attacks them, and a fight ensues (which is the unexplained fight in the original video). She runs back home and bangs on the door, and her father comes out. He grows furious, and has an alcoholic beverage in his hand, which implies that he is drunk. The man drives up, and her father slaps her face and yells at her to get inside the house. Her father then yells at him, and goes back inside to deal with his daughter, but she escapes out the window and runs to the man's car and they drive away, then Black Veil Brides begin to play the song in front of the same movie theater that the couple went to at the beginning of the video. At the very end of the video, it shows that Marilyn and her new boyfriend sent her father a photo of her kissing him, and her boyfriend giving her dad the finger (which is censored out in television airings and the director's cut). Marilyn's boyfriend's name is never revealed.

They have secretly existed since colonial times in Gotham City. The Court kidnaps child performers from the circus to train and transform them into their assassins, known as Talons, which first appeared in Batman #2 (2011). As part of the 2015‚Äì2016 \\"Robin War\\" storyline, the Court of Owls had expanded internationally and is referred to as the Parliament of Owls. Publication history The Court of Owls were created by writer Scott Snyder and artist Greg Capullo and feature as Batman's main antagonists in the first two-story arcs of The New 52, the 2011 reboot of DC's continuity. They are first mentioned in Batman #2 (2011) and make their first appearance in Batman #3 when Batman discovers one of their secret bases of operation, and where they are seen posing with one of their assassins, the Talon William Cobb, in a series of old photographs, finally providing Batman with proof of their existence. Fictional team history=The New 52 The Court of Owls is a conspiracy that has controlled Gotham City for centuries. They are a violent cabal of some of Gotham City's oldest and wealthiest families who use murder and money to wield political influence throughout history. Their bases of operation are hidden in some of the city's oldest structures. A nursery rhyme describing them has been passed down through Gotham's generations: To carry out their interests, they employ a breed of highly trained assassins known as Talons. The leaders of the organization appear to be human and wear owl masks on their faces. The earliest history of the Court of Owls dates back to Gotham's earliest days in the 1600s, and it has been involved in many criminal acts in Gotham over the years.Batman and Robin Vol. 2 #23.2. DC Comics. The Court of Owls took notice when billionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne announces plans to rebuild and reshape Gotham City for the future.Batman Vol. 2 #1. DC Comics. The Court sentences Bruce to death, and their assassin, the Talon William Cobb, attempts to murder him during a meeting with Lincoln March. They struggle at the top of Wayne Tower and the killer survives a fall from the top.Batman Vol. 2 #2. DC Comics. Batman discovers that their society has secret headquarters throughout hidden rooms in every building established by the Alan Wayne Trust, created by Bruce's great-grandfather, Alan Wayne. Bruce recounts that as a child he believed the Court of Owls responsible for the death of his parents, and personally investigated the conspiracy before determining that there was no evidence. Batman is caught and tortured by the Court, but escapes.Batman Vol. 2 #6. DC Comics. Not long after, apparently tired of their game and angered at Batman's escape and discovery of their lair, the Court unleashes the full might of their army of undead Talons on the city to kill Batman and his allies and retake Gotham for themselves.Batman Vol. 2 #7. DC Comics. In the 2012 storyline \\"Night of the Owls\\", which ran through the Batman-related books, the Court of Owls, angered at William Cobb's defeat at the hands of Batman, awaken all of their other Talons to reclaim Gotham City ‚Äì literally and ideologically ‚Äì from Batman. They also dispose of Cobb's body for Alfred Pennyworth to find. The Court's goal is to prove that they are the superior legend of Gotham City, not Batman. The Owls first attack the Batcave, but the injured Bruce still manages to defeat several of them due to their outdated fighting style. Alfred uncovers the forty targets of the Owls and sends a radio message out to the Batman Family for help. Tim Drake and Jason Todd receive one and Jason decides to protect Mr. Freeze. Robin (Damian Wayne), Batwing, and The Birds of Prey also answer Alfred's call. Bruce dons an armored Batsuit to be able to fight all of the Talons while one of the assassins revives William Cobb.Batman Vol. 2 #9. DC Comics. The Birds of Prey are one of the first to fight a Talon who is merciless and cruel in his methods, wanting to kill \\"street vermin\\".Birds of Prey Vol. 3 #9. DC Comics. Nightwing receives the message and goes to save Mayor Sebastian Hady. Nightwing has no problem in killing the Talon attacking Hady due to it already being dead, but upon stopping it, he is knifed in the chest by a revived Cobb. Cobb credits Nightwing, his descendant, working for Batman as his worst betrayal.Nightwing Vol. 3 #8. DC Comics. When Selina and Spark arrive to steal from the Penguin, they see the Penguin's car leaving, but are not aware that the Penguin himself is still alive and being viciously beat down by Ephraim Newhouse, a Talon.Catwoman Vol. 4 #9. DC Comics. Bruce, meanwhile, continues to fight the Talons invading the Batcave and eventually manages to stop them, and he heads out to save Jeremiah Arkham who is fighting the Talons through Roman Sionis.Detective Comics Vol. 2 #9. DC Comics. Nightwing is brutally beat down by Cobb who continues to mock him. Cobb demands that his heir impress him, eventually giving up and calling Nightwing a waste. Nightwing, however, retaliates and freezes Cobb, then offering to take Jeremiah Arkham from Batman.Batman: The Dark Knight Vol. 2 #9. DC Comics.

At the conclusion of the 2014-2015 series Batman: Eternal, it is revealed that Lincoln March used the Court's resources to fund Cluemaster's campaign against Batman, reasoning that Batman would not pay close attention to Cluemaster as a candidate while March let Cluemaster do all the work of wearing Batman down, planning to step in and kill the Dark Knight at the last minute before retreating back into the shadows, reasoning that Batman's public death at the hands of an unknown foe would forever end the 'myth' of the Dark Knight.

His son Benjamin Orchard ran away from home and joined Haly's Circus. R.H. turned his own son into a Talon as a reprisal for turning his back on his legacy. * Maria Powers ‚Äì The wife of Joseph Powers, owner of the Powers Hotel, and member of the Court of Owls. * Lincoln March ‚Äì A Gotham City mayoral candidate who claims to be Thomas Wayne Jr. * Thurston Moody ‚Äì A wealthy Gotham nobleman who is a potential member of the Court of Owls in the 1800s. He used kidnapped children as slaves beneath Gotham City which was uncovered by Jonah Hex and Amadeus Arkham. * Sebastian Clark ‚Äì Former Grandmaster of the Court. His father Erastus wrote a tell-all book on the Court, but was killed along with everyone who had any connection to the book, which he had published in secret in another state. Sebastian has what may be the only surviving copy. Sebastian escaped the Court when it came for his father and lived in Europe for years under an assumed identity. He then returned to Gotham and started selling security software of his own design to presumed members of the Court in an effort to uncover all he could about the Court so he could take it down. He befriended Calvin Rose and became his benefactor for a while, before Calvin realized he had been the Grandmaster of the Court. It seems Sebastian was using Calvin in a power grab to take the Court's assets and, with the help of Bane, take Gotham City. His plan was thwarted by Calvin and Batman and he ended up in Blackgate Prison. * John Wycliffe ‚Äì Grandmaster of the Court after Sebastian Clark. A descendant of Bartholomew Wycliffe, one of the signers of Gotham's original charter. He was killed by Sebastian Clark. Talons The Talons are a breed of deadly assassins that are absolutely loyal to the Court of Owls. They remain \\"sleeping\\" deep within their inner sanctum until they are \\"called\\" upon. The Court, seemingly obsessed with Greek mythology, began using electrum (a highly conductive alloy of silver and gold with trace amounts of copper and other elements) to treat their \\"retired\\" Talons. A serum was eventually developed that coupled with the electrum could bring the dead Talons back to life. Talons so revived appear to be unkillable, surviving knives through the skull, electrocution, losing a body part, falling from the height of a skyscraper etc. If exposed to extreme cold the revived Talons will shut down, entering a kind of stasis. The only means verified to kill a revived Talon is a poison developed by the Court. The Talons are highly trained and conditioned. They are extremely proficient with knives, and experts in hand-to-hand combat. In order to remain undetected the Talons are masters of stealth and concealment. Prior to the Night of the Owls the Court only had one active Talon at a time. The new Talon must prove himself worthy to wear that mantle by killing his predecessor in single combat in the Labyrinth. Talons are to follow the Court's orders and serve until they are deemed unfit for service due to age or failure, at which point they face their chosen successor. Revived Talons can be returned to their former self with the help of the Lazarus Pit.Talon Vol. 1 #17. DC Comics. The Talons below are listed by when they were first active. Among the known Talons are: * Uriah Boone ‚Äì Uriah Boone was one of the oldest Talons, active at some point before Gotham became an industrialized city. Centuries later, when the Batman confronted the Court about the Joker's supposed immortality, Uriah was hiding in the shadows, ready to defend the members and engaged the Batman in a fight. * Ephraim Newhouse ‚Äì Ephraim Newhouse was the Talon of 1665. However, his sloppiness forced the court to retire him, stripping him of his weapons and armor with a mark of disgrace on his record. Four of his knives were stolen by Catwoman centuries later. During the Night of the Owls storyline, Ephraim was revived and sent by the Court to assassinate Oswald Cobblepot. By sheer coincidence, the Penguin was in possession of the fifth knife which Catwoman had set her own sights on. In the ensuing conflict, Catwoman saved the Penguin's life and promised the five knives back to the Talon preying on his need for redemption in the eyes of the Court of Owls. The Penguin shot him through the head before an exchange could be made, and so Catwoman ‚Äì feeling as though she and the Talon were kindred spirits ‚Äì laid his body on the roof of Gotham City Police Department with his five knives and turned on the Bat-Signal.Catwoman #9 * Henry Ballard ‚Äì Henry Ballard was encountered by the Birds of Prey. He remembered the Gotham City of 1847 as a violent place and saw the city's present the same way. When he was unmasked, he already had the appearance of an old man. He seemingly regards women as \\"vermin\\", suggesting misogyny traits. The Birds of Prey managed to subdue him when Poison Ivy dragged him into a refrigerated train car meant for carrying meat. * Alexander Staunton ‚Äì Alexander Staunton was the Talon in 1856. He was effective, but his killings lacked the subtlety the Court of the day felt was essential, and he was retired. During the Night of the Owls he was sent to kill Lucius Fox, but was stopped by Batwing. * Felix Harmon ‚Äì Felix Harmon was known as The Gotham Butcher who was a Talon in the 1860s. He is shown as a young strongman at Haly's Circus in 1852. He killed 140 civilians the Court had not targeted for execution, as well as two Court members. In 1862, he killed everyone in the Carpenter Home for Orphans and set the building on fire. He states that he killed as young as 14. He is a complete psychopath and is physically huge, shown to be about 9-10' tall and heavily muscled. His teeth are pointed and his fingernails like claws. He is noted as being an expert tracker. The Court finally subdued and killed him, placing him in the Tomb of the Unworthy. He is revived out of desperation to kill Calvin Rose. During their final confrontation he has his left arm severed, is cut in half, and beheaded. As one of the revived Talons he is basically unkillable, but before he could fully revive he was placed in a custom built cryo-facility. * Xiao Loong ‚Äì Xiao Loong was the Talon of the 1890s. He was an acrobat of Chinese descent. In his time, he was sent to assassinate Thurston Moody, the former deputy head of Gotham Sanitation, who was a member of a terrorist group called the August 7. * The O'Malleys ‚Äì Three generations of O'Malley served as Talons: James O'Malley, his son Brandon and his grandson Nathaniel. Nathaniel is seen as a failure by his grandfather in particular, especially for having failed to sire an heir. Nathaniel reveals that he chose not to sire an heir so his line would end and cease serving as Talons. All three O'Malleys are revived, but Nathaniel chooses to help Calvin Rose fight the Court. * William Cobb ‚Äì William Cobb is the assassin sent to murder Bruce Wayne, prior to the Night of the Owls. Born on October 10, 1901, William Cobb was the son of an ironworker and textile worker who lost his life while working on a bridge. This event robbed young William of his childhood, as he and his mother struggled to survive afterwards. After an encounter with a man named Nathaniel, Cobb joined a circus, mastering the art of throwing knives and earning fame. Cobb met and fell in love with Amelia Crowe, the daughter of Burton Crowe, which resulted in Amelia's pregnancy, but Burton disapproved and arranged for her to marry a second cousin. Through Nathaniel's efforts, Cobb joined the Court of Owls and became a Talon in order to make a difference in society. Cobb kidnapped his infant son and gave the boy to Nathaniel, urging Nathaniel to release the child in secret and prepare him for the legacy as the \\"Gray Son\\" of Gotham,Nightwing Vol. 3 #9. DC Comics. viz. Cobb's son becomes the first in his bloodline to be called Grayson, as it has been ever since. After failed attempts to defeat Batman, Batman discovers that Cobb is Dick Grayson's great-grandfather. Cobb is disappointed to learn that Dick, as Nightwing, is an ally of Batman, and faces his great-grandson in combat, in which Dick Grayson is victorious. * Jonas ‚Äì Jonas was the Talon of the 1920s. He was from a poor African American farming family in Georgia. From a very young age Jonas had a love for animals, especially birds. His mother, however, after losing her mind killed all the pet chickens of Jonas with an axe in a fit of madness. After the Spanish flu killed his family he ran away and was taken in by Haly's Circus. The Court of Owls took notice of the young boy, noting his fearlessness while training the dangerous animals. He completed his training as a Talon defeating William Cobb in the Court's Labyrinth. Jonas was however mentally unstable, carving a \\"feather\\" into his flesh after taking the life of a victim. He was seen to be proficient with blades and knives like most of the Talons but also carried an axe. * Benjamin Orchard ‚Äì A Talon in the 1930s for one year. His father made him a Talon as punishment for running away to join Haly's Circus, but only allowed him to serve for one year before having him killed. He is revived for the Night of the Owls and guards the Orchard Hotel. It is unclear whether or not he survived the partial destruction of the hotel, but as a revived Talon he is nigh unkillable. * Mary Turner ‚Äì Mary is the Talon of the 1940s. She was horribly disfigured at a young age by a bomb attached to a balloon which was sent by Emperor Hirohito to cause panic in the United States during World War II. Mary is awakened and sent to coerce Commissioner Gordon into letting his police force handle the Night of the Owls ineffectively and into inadvertently lighting a modified Bat-Signal which fills the sky with the symbol of the Court of Owls, thereby killing hope that the Batman will save Gotham. She faces Batgirl, but lets her go, because they both wear masks. Later, Catwoman broke Mary out of Blackgate Penitentiary, having been hired by a prominent member of the Court. When she realized his motivations, though, she turned on him, and with Batgirl, they defeated his Talons ‚Äì including Mary, who turned on her master in the name of friendship with the two women. In order to protect Mary, Catwoman faced the police alone, leaving Batgirl to get Mary out.Batgirl Annual (Vol 4) #1. DC Comics. Batgirl's solution was to find a place for Mary with the Birds of PreyBirds of Prey (Vol 3) #15. DC Comics. giving her the codename \\"Strix\\" (which is Latin for \\"owl\\").Birds of Prey (Volume 3) #16. DC Comics. * Alton Carver ‚Äì Alton Carver was the most recent Talon. Like every other Talon, Carver was a performer with Haly's Circus, but his fear of death prevented him from mastering the high-wire. Frustrated, the ringmaster forced him to overcome his fear by setting his trailer ablaze with him inside. When he emerged, burned but alive, he was ready for the Court's training. Twenty-six years later, he had become one of the best Talons, but he had also become sloppy. He was warned that if he continued to make mistakes, he would be replaced with a boy who had already been chosen to succeed him. On the night of the mission that was meant to redeem him, Carver could not help but go to see the one who would replace him. He saw Dick Grayson perform and knew that the boy would outmatch him. Having delayed too long, he missed his chance to kill his target stealthily and was attacked by Batman. His failure forced the Court to retire him, and he was not wakened again until the Night of the Owls. He was given mayoral candidate Lincoln March as target. Though March was stabbed, he shot Carver in the head. Unexpectedly, though, Carver revived, and attacked the Batman, who had arrived on the scene. The battle ended with Carver sent careening through the window and onto the street below. Despite the fall, he managed to escape into the sewers. * Calvin Rose ‚Äì Calvin is shown locked in a dog kennel by his father at age 8 for three days, at which point he is able to break the chain on the door and escape to Haly's Circus. Calvin Rose was trained as an escape artist at Haly's Circus. He was then recruited by the Court of Owls and trained to be their next Talon. He completed all of the Court's tests to become the new Talon, including killing his predecessor in single combat. He even escapes the Labyrinth, which no one else at that point in time has ever done (Batman later escapes as well). On his first mission he disobeys the Court, saving Sarah and Casey Washington and going on the run from the Court. He was the only Talon to ever escape the grasp of the Court of Owls. He is a world class escape artist and a trained assassin. He is killed by Bane, but revived by the Court. As a revived Talon he is nigh unkillable, feels no pain, and heals from any wound. He disobeyed the Court again and they sentenced him to die, even injecting him with the poison which appears to be the only thing capable of killing a revived Talon. He fought on to bring down Felix Harmon and Sebastian Clark, sustaining injuries that would have killed a normal man several times over. The poison very nearly killed him, but using dialysis Lucius Fox and Casey Washington are able to remove the poison from his body and revive him. He is then ushered into Batman Incorporated. In other media=Television * The Court of Owls appears in Gotham.EXCLUSIVE: Bruno Heller Confirms Court of Owls for GothamFish Mooney Returns to Gotham? - #DCTV Known members are Kathryn Monroe (portrayed by Kit Flanagan in season 2, Leslie Hendrix in season 3), James Gordon's uncle Frank Gordon (portrayed by James Remar), the Talons (portrayed by Brandon Alan Smith, here wearing business suits and domino masks), and some unidentified people in owl masks with Sensei (portrayed by Raymond J. Barry) as their secret leader. James Gordon also briefly joins the Court of Owls in order to discover their plan to destroy Gotham. First appearing in \\"Wrath of the Villains: A Legion of Horribles\\", the Court of Owls are revealed to be Hugo Strange's employers, who have tasked him to find a means to revive the dead. In Season Three, they work on weaponizing the poisonous blood of Jervis Tetch's sister Alice in order to \\"save Gotham City\\" by plunging it into chaos upon being manipulated by Ra's al Ghul and the League of Assassins. By \\"Heroes Rise: Pretty Hate Machine\\", all of the Court of Owls members were killed by the Talons working for Sensei because they condoned Hugo Strange‚Äôs unauthorized murder of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne. Film The Court of Owls appear in the animated film Batman vs. Robin, with an unidentified main Talon (voiced by Jeremy Sisto) that resembles Calvin Rose. This Talon is the son of an abusive jewel thief who turned his father into the police, resulting in his death after a failed job. He was soon recruited into the Court of Owls, and developed a desire to help Damian Wayne / Robin realize his potential. In the film, Talon attempts to persuade Robin to join the Court of Owls following several encounters. However, Talon kills the Grandmaster (voiced by Robin Atkin Downes), the socialite Samantha Vanaver (voiced by Grey DeLisle), and betrays the rest of the Court of Owls after refusing to kill a kidnapped Robin and seizes control of the Court's army of zombified Talons.

YRE was launched by an international demonstration of 40,000 people against racism, in Brussels in October 1992. It was a wave of racist attacks in Germany and the success of the Blokbuster Belgian youth movement, opposing the far-right Vlaams Blok, which convinced the Committee for a Workers' International, to work to launch an international youth organization along the same lines. In 1994, YRE organised an anti-racist camp in Germany of 1,500 young people from all over Europe. The charity Show Racism the Red Card, founded by Ged Grebby, was inspired by his work and involvement with YRE, particularly the concept of educational packs for schools. Britain In the UK, YRE was launched in 1992, at a time of rising racist violence and electoral support for the far right. YRE was formed by Militant Labour as an alternative to the rival Socialist Workers Party (UK)'s Anti-Nazi League (ANL), relaunched the previous year, and the Socialist Action-dominated Anti-Racist Alliance, also launched in 1991. In Britain, YRE's activity has focused around opposition to the British National Party. In 1987 the BNP moved its headquarters to Welling, in south east London. In the next six years there were four racially motivated murders in south-east London, including that of Stephen Lawrence in April 1993. The following month, on a demonstration called by YRE and others, including Panther, the black socialist organisation, over 8,000 people marched past the BNP headquarters in protest at the murders and the far-right party's presence in the area. Subsequent larger demonstrations were called, co- organised by YRE, numbering 60,000 and 50,000 respectively. A demonstration in October that year met with heavy police presence, leading to violent clashes between police and protesters. In 2010, the group was at the centre of controversy over undercover policing in Britain, following revelations that YRE had been infiltrated by the Metropolitan Police and accusations that the police sought to discredit the anti-racism movement through the use of agent provocateur tactics. France YRE launched in France in 1993, with a month- long speaking tour by a British Panther activist based around the recently released Malcolm X film. YRE gained considerable popularity amongst French youth through notable campaigns in defense of immigrants without working papers and the rights of girls wearing the hijab in Mantes-la-Jolie. YRE's participation in an anti-deportation campaign whose goal was to mobilize the passengers of flights departing from Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport against deportations, earned the organisation the ire of the Minister of the Interior of the time, Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement. Greece The Greek YRE has organised demonstrations with immigrants in support of immigrant workers' rights, as well as campaigning for the provision of facilities for Gypsies in the country. In recent years, it has worked to oppose the extreme right-wing Golden Dawn, which won its first municipal council seat in 2010 and entered parliament for the first time in 2012. This has included calling for the shutting down of the organisation and its weekly newspaper on the grounds that \\"they propagate violent messages of hate\\".

Ignatian Pedagogical paradigm Synopsis (2) It is based in St. Ignatius Loyola's Spiritual Exercises, and takes a holistic view of the world. The three main elements are Experience, Reflection, and Action. A pre- learning element, Context, and a post-learning element, Evaluation, are also necessary for the method's success, bringing the total to five elements. Ignatian pedagogy uses this dynamic five-step method along with an Ignatian vision of the human and the world to \\"accompany the learner in their growth and development.\\"International Commission on the Apostolate of Jesuit Education [ICAJE], 1993, p. 240). The Ignatian pedagogical paradigm is also used in spiritual retreats and learning experiences as an active means of developing and questioning one's own conscience, as well as in making sound and conscientious decisions.  History of the Ignatian pedagogical paradigm  The Ignatian pedagogical paradigm (IPP) is over 450 years old.(PDF) Van Hise, J. and D. Massey. 2010. Applying the Ignatian pedagogical paradigm to the creation of an accounting ethics course. Journal of Business Ethics (2010) 96:453‚Äì465. Accessed June 7, 2012 In 1599, the first official version of the method was published in Ratio Studiorum (Latin for \\"plan of studies\\")(Ratio), although the method was not called the \\"Ignatian pedagogical paradigm\\" in Ratio. Still, the basic method was present. In the ensuing centuries, Jesuit institutions of learning around the world have adopted the methods laid out in Ratio and refined by others through the years.  The Ignatian pedagogical paradigm = Context  The context in which the learner finds himself or herself is important. This is partly the real circumstances of a student's life which include family, peers, social situations, the educational institution, politics, economics, cultural climate, the church situation, media, music and so on.The Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm, paras 38-41, www.staloysius.nsw.edu.au. retrieved June 7, 2012 The socio-economic, political and cultural contexts must not be forgotten, as these can seriously affect his or her growth as a person for others. Cultures of poverty usually negatively affect expectations about success; oppressive political regimes usually discourage open inquiry. These and many other factors may stifle the freedom encouraged by Ignatian pedagogy. As mentioned above, the institutional environment of the learning center is part of the context. Prior learning is part of the context. Points of view and insights acquired from earlier study or spontaneously acquired from their environment are part of the context. Their feelings and attitudes regarding the subject matter also form part of the real context for learning.  Experience  \\"The learning experience is expected to move beyond rote knowledge to the development of the more complex learning skills of understanding, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. . . .We use the term experience to describe any activity in which in addition to a cognitive grasp of the matter being considered, some sensation of an affective nature is registered by the student. . . .In his pedagogy, Ignatius highlights the affective/evaluative stage of the learning process because he is conscious that in addition to letting one 'sense and taste,' i.e., deepen one's experience, affective feelings are motivational forces that move one's understanding to action and commitment.\\" Learners gather and recollect their own experiences in order to understand what they know already in terms of facts, feelings, values, insights and intuitions they bring to the current study.  Reflection  This is the fundamental key to the paradigm. This is how the student makes the learning experience his or her own and obtains the meaning of the learning experience for herself and for others.The Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm. Loyola Jesuit College. accessed June 7, 2012 Reflection means thoughtful reconsideration of subject matter, an experience, an idea, a purpose or a spontaneous reaction, that its significance may be more fully grasped. Reflection is how meaning becomes apparent in human experience. Memory, understanding, imagination and feelings are used to perceive meaning and value in the subject matter, and to discover connections with other forms of knowledge and activity, and to understand its implications in the further search for truth and liberty. Ignatian learning cannot stop at experience. It would lack the component of reflection where meaning and significance arise, and where integration of that meaning translates into competence, conscience and compassion. The student considers what the material means to him or her, and personally appropriates it.  Action  Action means the learner's internal state - that is: attitudes, priorities, commitments, habits, values, ideals, and growth - flowing out into actions for others. Ignatius Loyola sought not just to serve God but to excel in such service, to do even more than what is required. \\"Ignatius does not seek just any action or commitment. Rather, while respecting human freedom, he strives to encourage decision and commitment for the magis, the better service of God and our sisters and brothers. Jesuit education is not meant to end in mere personal satisfaction. It is meant to move the learner to act. The goal is not merely to educate the mind, but to change the person into a better, more caring human with a developed conscience.  Evaluation  Periodic evaluation of the learner's growth is essential. In the paradigm, it measures more than intellectual success, artistic talent, or athletic ability. Evaluation is to assess those things, but it is also to produce an awareness of the real needs yet unmet, as well as to understand the learner's own personal and moral growth.

Computable topology is not to be confused with algorithmic or computational topology, which studies the application of computation to topology. Topology of lambda calculus As shown by Alan Turing and Alonzo Church, the Œª-calculus is strong enough to describe all mechanically computable functions (see Church‚ÄìTuring thesis).Church 1934:90 footnote in Davis 1952Turing 1936‚Äì7 in Davis 1952:149Barendregt, H.P., The Lambda Calculus Syntax and Semantics. North- Holland Publishing Company. 1981 Lambda-calculus is thus effectively a programming language, from which other languages can be built. For this reason when considering the topology of computation it is common to focus on the topology of Œª-calculus. Note that this is not necessarily a complete description of the topology of computation, since functions which are equivalent in the Church-Turing sense may still have different topologies. The topology of Œª-calculus is the Scott topology, and when restricted to continuous functions the type free Œª-calculus amounts to a topological space reliant on the tree topology. Both the Scott and Tree topologies exhibit continuity with respect to the binary operators of application ( f applied to a = fa ) and abstraction ((Œªx.t(x))a = t(a)) with a modular equivalence relation based on a congruency. The Œª-algebra describing the algebraic structure of the lambda-calculus is found to be an extension of the combinatory algebra, with an element introduced to accommodate abstraction. Type free Œª-calculus treats functions as rules and does not differentiate functions and the objects which they are applied to, meaning Œª-calculus is type free. A by-product of type free Œª-calculus is an effective computability equivalent to general recursion and Turing machines.Barendregt, H.P., The Lambda Calculus Syntax and Semantics. North-Holland Publishing Company. 1981. The set of Œª-terms can be considered a functional topology in which a function space can be embedded, meaning Œª mappings within the space X are such that Œª:X ‚Üí X.D. S. Scott. Models for the Œª-calculus. Informally distributed, 1969. Notes, December 1969, Oxford Univ. Introduced November 1969, Dana Scott's untyped set theoretic model constructed a proper topology for any Œª-calculus model whose function space is limited to continuous functions. The result of a Scott continuous Œª-calculus topology is a function space built upon a programming semantic allowing fixed point combinatorics, such as the Y combinator, and data types.Gordon, M.J.C., The Denotational Description of Programming Languages. Springer Verlag, Berlin. 1979.Scott, D. S. and Strachey, C. Toward a Mathematical Semantics for Computer Languages, Proc. Symp. on Computers and Automata, Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, 21, pp. 19 46. 1971. By 1971, Œª-calculus was equipped to define any sequential computation and could be easily adapted to parallel computations.G. Berry, Sequential algorithms on concrete data structures, Theoretical Computer Science 20, 265 321 (1982). The reducibility of all computations to Œª-calculus allows these Œª-topological properties to become adopted by all programming languages. Computational algebra from Œª-calculus algebra Based on the operators within lambda calculus, application and abstraction, it is possible to develop an algebra whose group structure uses application and abstraction as binary operators. Application is defined as an operation between lambda terms producing a Œª-term, e.g. the application of Œª onto the lambda term a produces the lambda term Œªa. Abstraction incorporates undefined variables by denoting Œªx.t(x) as the function assigning the variable a to the lambda term with value t(a) via the operation ((Œª x.t(x))a = t(a)). Lastly, an equivalence relation emerges which identifies Œª-terms modulo convertible terms, an example being beta normal form. Scott topology The Scott topology is essential in understanding the topological structure of computation as expressed through the Œª-calculus. Scott found that after constructing a function space using Œª-calculus one obtains a Kolmogorov space, a T_o topological space which exhibits pointwise convergence, in short the product topology.D. S. Scott. \\"Continuous Lattices.\\" Oxford University Computing Laboratory August, 1971. It is the ability of self homeomorphism as well as the ability to embed every space into such a space, denoted Scott continuous, as previously described which allows Scott's topology to be applicable to logic and recursive function theory. Scott approaches his derivation using a complete lattice, resulting in a topology dependent on the lattice structure. It is possible to generalise Scott's theory with the use of complete partial orders. For this reason a more general understanding of the computational topology is provided through complete partial orders. We will re-iterate to familiarize ourselves with the notation to be used during the discussion of Scott topology. Complete partial orders are defined as follows: First, given the partially ordered set D=(D,‚â§), a nonempty subset X ‚äÜ D is directed if ‚àÄ x,y ‚àà X ‚àÉ z ‚àà X where x‚â§ z & y ‚â§ z. D is a complete partial order (cpo) if: ::* Every directed X ‚äÜD has a supremum, and: ::‚àÉ bottom element ‚ä• ‚àà D such that ‚àÄ x ‚àà D ‚ä• ‚â§ x. We are now able to define the Scott topology over a cpo (D, ‚â§ ). O ‚äÜ D is open if: ::# for x ‚àà O, and x ‚â§ y, then y ‚àà O, i.e. O is an upper set. ::# for a directed set X ‚äÜ D, and supremum(X) ‚àà O, then X ‚à© O ‚â† ‚àÖ. Using the Scott topological definition of open it is apparent that all topological properties are met. ::*‚àÖ and D, i.e. the empty set and whole space, are open. ::*Arbitrary unions of open sets are open: :::: Proof: Assume U_i is open where i ‚àà I, I being the index set. We define U = ‚à™{ U_i ; i ‚àà I}. Take b as an element of the upper set of U, therefore a ‚â§ b for some a ‚àà U It must be that a ‚àà U_i for some i, likewise b ‚àà upset(U_i). U must therefore be upper as well since U_i ‚àà U. ::::Likewise, if D is a directed set with a supremum in U, then by assumption sup(D) ‚àà U_i where U_i is open. Thus there is a b ‚àà D where b ‚àà U_{i} \\\\cap D \\\\subseteq U \\\\cap D. The union of open sets U_i is therefore open. ::*Open sets under intersection are open: ::::Proof: Given two open sets, U and V, we define W = U‚à©V. If W = ‚àÖ then W is open. If non-empty say b ‚àà upset(W) (the upper set of W), then for some a ‚àà W, a ‚â§ b. Since a ‚àà U‚à©V, and b an element of the upper set of both U and V, then b ‚àà W. ::::Finally, if D is a directed set with a supremum in W, then by assumption sup(D) ‚àà U \\\\cap V. So there is a ‚àà U \\\\cap D and b ‚àà V \\\\cap D. Since D is directed there is c ‚àà D with a \\\\le c, b\\\\le c; and since U and V are upper sets, c ‚àà U \\\\cap V as well. Though not shown here, it is the case that the map f: D \\\\rightarrow D^{'} is continuous if and only if f(sup(X)) = sup(f(X)) for all directed X‚äÜD, where f(X) = {f(x)  x ‚àà X} and the second supremum in D^{'}. Before we begin explaining that application as common to Œª-calculus is continuous within the Scott topology we require a certain understanding of the behavior of supremums over continuous functions as well as the conditions necessary for the product of spaces to be continuous namely :# With {f_i}_i \\\\subseteq [D \\\\rightarrow D^{'}] be a directed family of maps, then f(x) = \\\\cup_{i}f_i(x) if well defined and continuous. :# If F \\\\subseteq [D \\\\rightarrow D^{'}] is directed and cpo and [D \\\\rightarrow D^{'}] a cpo where sup({f(x)  f ‚àà F}). We now show the continuity of application. Using the definition of application as follows: :::Ap: [D\\\\rightarrow D^{'}] \\\\times D \\\\rightarrow D^{'} where Ap(f,x) = f(x). Ap is continuous with respect to the Scott topology on the product ( [D \\\\rightarrow D^{'}] \\\\times D \\\\rightarrow D^{'}) : ::Proof: Œªx.f(x) = f is continuous. Let h = Œª f.f(x). For directed F\\\\subseteq [D \\\\rightarrow D^{'}] :: h(sup(F)) = sup(F)(x) :::: = sup( {f(x)  f ‚àà F} ) :::: = sup( {h(f)  f ‚àà F} ) :::: = sup( h(F) ) ::By definition of Scott continuity h has been shown continuous. All that is now required to prove is that application is continuous when it's separate arguments are continuous, i.e. [D \\\\rightarrow D^{'}] and D \\\\rightarrow D^{'} are continuous, in our case f and h. ::Now abstracting our argument to show f:D \\\\times D^{'} \\\\rightarrow D^{} with g = \\\\lambda x.f(x,x_0) and d=\\\\lambda x^{'}.f(x_0,x^{'}) as the arguments for D and D^{'} respectively, then for a directed X ‚äÜ D :: g(\\\\sup(X)) = f(\\\\sup(X), x_0^{'})) :::: = f( sup( (x,x_{0}^{'})  x ‚àà X} )) :::: (since f is continuous and {(x,x_{0}^{'})  x ‚àà X}) is directed): :::: = sup( {f(x,x_{0}^{'})  x ‚àà X} ) :::: = sup(g(X)) ::g is therefore continuous. The same process can be taken to show d is continuous. ::It has now been shown application is continuous under the Scott topology. In order to demonstrate the Scott topology is a suitable fit for Œª-calculus it is necessary to prove abstraction remains continuous over the Scott topology. Once completed it will have been shown that the mathematical foundation of Œª-calculus is a well defined and suitable candidate functional paradigm for the Scott topology. With f \\\\in [D \\\\times D^{'} \\\\rightarrow D^{}] we define \\\\check{f} (x) =Œª y ‚àà D^{'}f(x,y)We will show: :(i) \\\\check{f} is continuous, meaning \\\\check{f} ‚àà [D \\\\rightarrow [D^{'} \\\\rightarrow D^{}] :(ii) Œª f.\\\\check{f}: [D \\\\times D^{'} \\\\rightarrow D^{}]\\\\rightarrow [D\\\\rightarrow [D^{'}\\\\rightarrow D^{}] is continuous. ::Proof (i): Let X ‚äÜ D be directed, then ::\\\\check{f}(sup(X)) = Œª y.f( sup(X),y ) :::: = Œª y.\\\\sup_{x \\\\isin X}( f(x,y) ) :::: = \\\\sup_{x \\\\isin X}( Œªy.f(x,y) ) :::: = sup(\\\\check{f}(X)) ::Proof (ii): Defining L = Œª f.\\\\check{f} then for F \\\\subseteq [D \\\\times D^{'} \\\\rightarrow D^{}] directed ::L(sup(F)) = Œª x Œª y.

B√∂hm trees and computational topology B√∂hm trees, easily represented graphically, express the computational behavior of a lambda term. It is possible to predict the functionality of a given lambda expression from reference to its correlating B√∂hm tree. B√∂hm trees can be seen somewhat analogous to \\\\mathbb{R} where the B√∂hm tree of a given set is similar to the continued fraction of a real number, and what is more, the B√∂hm tree corresponding to a sequence in normal form is finite, similar to the rational subset of the Reals. B√∂hm trees are defined by a mapping of elements within a sequence of numbers with ordering (‚â§, lh) and a binary operator * to a set of symbols. The B√∂hm tree is then a relation among a set of symbols through a partial mapping œà. Informally B√∂hm trees may be conceptualized as follows: :Given: Œ£ = \\\\perp \\\\cup { Œª x_{1} \\\\cdots x_{n} . y  n ‚àà \\\\mathbb{N}, x_{1} ... x_{n}y are variables and denoting BT(M) as the B√∂hm tree for a lambda term M we then have: :BT(M) = ‚ä• if M is unsolvable (therefore a single node) BT(M) = Œª\\\\vec{x}.y / \\\\ BT( M_{1} ) BT( M_{m} ) ; if M is solvable More formally: Œ£ is defined as a set of symbols. The B√∂hm tree of a Œª term M, denoted BT(M), is the Œ£ labelled tree defined as follows: ::If M is unsolvable: :: BT(M)(\\\\langle\\\\ \\\\rangle) = \\\\perp, ::BT(M)(\\\\langle k\\\\rangle * \\\\alpha) is unsolvable \\\\forall k, \\\\alpha If M is solvable, where M = Œª x_{1} \\\\cdots x_{n}.y M_{0} \\\\cdots M_{m-1}: ::BT(M)(< >) = Œª x_{1} \\\\cdots x_{n}.y ::BT(M)(\\\\langle k\\\\rangle * \\\\alpha) = BT(M_k)(\\\\alpha) \\\\forall \\\\alpha and k < m :::::= undefined \\\\forall \\\\alpha and k ‚â• m We may now move on to show that B√∂hm trees act as suitable mappings from the tree topology to the scott topology. Allowing one to see computational constructs, be it within the Scott or tree topology, as B√∂hm tree formations. B√∂hm tree and tree topology It is found that B√∂hm tree's allow for a continuous mapping from the tree topology to the Scott topology. More specifically: We begin with the cpo B = (B,‚äÜ) on the Scott topology, with ordering of B√∂hm tree's denoted M‚äÜ N, meaning M, N are trees and M results from N. The tree topology on the set ∆î is the smallest set allowing for a continuous map ::BT:\\\\Gamma \\\\rightarrow B. An equivalent definition would be to say the open sets of ∆î are the image of the inverse B√∂hm tree BT^{-1} (O) where O is Scott open in B. The applicability of the B√∂mh trees and the tree topology has many interesting consequences to Œª-terms expressed topologically: :Normal forms are found to exist as isolated points. :Unsolvable Œª-terms are compactification points. :Application and abstraction, similar to the Scott topology, are continuous on the tree topology. Algebraic structure of computation New methods of interpretation of the Œª-calculus are not only interesting in themselves but allow new modes of thought concerning the behaviors of computer science. The binary operator within the Œª-algebra A is application. Application is denoted * and is said to give structure A=(X, \\\\cdot). A combinatory algebra allows for the application operator and acts as a useful starting point but remains insufficient for the Œª-calculus in being unable to express abstraction. The Œª algebra becomes a combinatory algebra M combined with a syntactic operator Œª* that transforms a term B(x,y), with constants in M, into C(\\\\hat{y})‚â° Œª* x.B(x,\\\\hat{y}). It is also possible to define an extension model to circumvent the need of the Œª* operator by allowing ‚àÄx (fx =gx) ‚áí f =g . The construction of the Œª-algebra through the introduction of an abstraction operator proceeds as follows: We must construct an algebra which allows for solutions to equations such as axy = xyy such that a = Œª xy.xyy there is need for the combinatory algebra. Relevant attributes of the combinatory algebra are: Within combinatory algebra there exists applicative structures. An applicative structure W is a combinatory algebra provided: ::*W is non-trival, meaning W has cardinality > 1 ::*W exhibits combinatory completeness (see completeness of the S-K basis). More specifically: for every term A ‚àà the set of terms of W, and x_1, ... , x_n with the free variables of A within {x_1, ... ,x_n} then: ::: \\\\exists f \\\\forall x_1 \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot x_n where fx_1 \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot x_n = A The combinatory algebra is: *Never commutative *Not associative. *Never finite. *Never recursive. Combinatory algebras remain unable to act as the algebraic structure for Œª-calculus, the lack of recursion being a major disadvantage. However the existence of an applicative term A(x, \\\\vec{y}) provides a good starting point to build a Œª-calculus algebra. What is needed is the introduction of a lambda term, i.e. include Œªx.A(x, \\\\vec{y}). We begin by exploiting the fact that within a combinatory algebra M, with A(x, \\\\vec{y}) within the set of terms, then: ::\\\\forall \\\\vec{y} \\\\exists b s.t. bx = A(x, \\\\vec{y}). We then require b have a dependence on \\\\vec{y} resulting in: :::\\\\forall x B(\\\\vec{y})x = A(x, \\\\vec{y}).

Woodford in the regalia of Grand Chaplain (UGLE) Adolphus Frederick Alexander Woodford (1821‚Äì1887) was the eldest son of Alexander George Woodford, a career soldier who was already a hero of Waterloo, and would rise to Field Marshal, ending his days in command of Chelsea Hospital. After a short stay in the Coldstream Guards, Adolphus entered the Anglican Church, having the living of Swillington from 1847‚Äì1872. On leaving the Army, he also became a Freemason, rising to become Grand Chaplain in 1863, commuting from Yorkshire to his London duties.John A. Seed, AFA Woodford, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum 93, 1980, pp 118‚Äì128 After moving to London, his editorship of the Freemason ignited an interest in the study of Masonic history, and led to the establishment of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, dedicated to masonic research. Woodford was the first Immediate Past Master of the lodge, and as such convened the lodge for much of its first two years, during the frequent absences of Charles Warren, the master.see Ars Quatuor Coronatorum vol 1, 1888 Just before his death, towards the end of 1887, he passed on a set of coded papers which resulted in the establishment of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Birth, Army and Vocation Adolphus Woodford was born on 9 July 1821. His father was already a distinguished soldier, and as eldest son he was named for the Colonel-in-Chief of his father's regiment, the Coldstream Guards. It seems a natural progression for Adolphus to have become an officer in the same regiment. He was gazetted as a lieutenant on 25 December 1838, but resigned on 23 April 1841. His father was, by this time, Governor-general of Gibraltar, and it was there, on 9 February 1842, that Adolphus was initiated into his father's lodge, the Lodge of Friendship No 345 (now the Royal Lodge of Friendship No 278). He took the customary three degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft and Master Mason, and is known to have attended nine meetings of the lodge in total, before returning to England in the autumn, matriculating at the University of Durham to study Theology.R. F. Gould, Obituary of the Rev. A. F. A. Woodford, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol 1, 1888, pp 174‚Äì176 He was awarded his Bachelor of Arts in 1846, and Licentiate of Theology in 1847. Meanwhile, he joined Marquis of Granby Lodge No 146 (now 124), and served two years as Master. His second year as master, 1847, also saw him appointed Provincial Grand Chaplain for the County of Durham. His academic achievements, while less than impressive, saw him ordained Priest that same year, and appointed Rector of St. Mary's Church, Swillington, where he would remain for the next twenty-five years.Woodforde Family Website The Revd Adolphus Woodford, retrieved 13 January 2013 (Genealogical Website) The Rector of Swillington In 1847 Swillington, to the south-east of Leeds, was still a rural community, although mining was starting to assert itself as the driving force of the local economy. Woodford was still the Provincial Grand Chaplain in Durham, while completing structural work on his church in Yorkshire.William Bowman, Reliquiae Antiquae Eboracences, Cooke and Clarke, Leeds, 1855, pp. 22‚Äì23 It was not until 1854 that he joined Philanthropic Lodge No 382 (now 304). The next year he was appointed Provincial Grand Chaplain for West Yorkshire. He was master of Philanthropic in 1856 and 1858, and the lodge history asserts that it thrived during the years of his regular attendance. He re-wrote their ritual in a unique form, which was shared with five daughter and granddaughter lodges.Philanthropic Lodge History of Philanthropic Lodge, retrieved 15 January 2013 He joined the Lodge of Antiquity in London in 1863, and that same year became Grand Chaplain of United Grand Lodge. While still Rector of Swillington, his new masonic duties took him to the consecration of many new lodges, and saw him deliver the oration at the laying of the foundation stone for the new extension to Freemason's Hall in Great Queen Street, London, the next year. In the same period, Woodford started to contribute articles on masonic history, starting with his researches into the old York lodges. He became known to local booksellers as he began to collect old manuscripts. 1871 saw Woodford as one of the signatories of a remonstrance against the Privy Council for upholding a conviction of an Anglican Vicar, John Purchas, for the way in which he celebrated communion.Anglican History Purchas remonstrance, retrieved 18 January 2013 The following year, he moved to London, resigning his living for a career in Masonic publishing. The Writer In London, Woodford settled into a busy career as a writer and researcher. Contributing essays to several publications and periodicals, he also edited the Freemason and the Masonic Magazine, frequently contributing most of the copy himself. He compiled Kenning's Masonic Cyclopaedia for the publisher of the two magazines. Woodford used the Freemason in 1879 to oppose a move in Grand Lodge to enforce uniformity of ritual on its lodges. His own letter on the subject provoked much correspondence, convincing Grand Lodge of the groundswell of resistance to such a move. The last few years of his life were also occupied in collaboration with other Masonic researchers, such as Hughan and Gould, which eventually brought into being England's first research lodge, Quatuor Coronati. As acting Immediate Past Master, he guided the lodge through its first two years of existence, taking the chair in the frequent absences of the Master, Charles Warren, then Metropolitan Commissioner of Police. It is plain from Gould's obituary that the rest of the lodge looked on him as a mentor. Death and legacy In December 1887, Woodford contracted septicaemia from an untreated foot injury. He died on 23 December. He is seen as a pioneer of the Authentic school of masonic research, applying proper historical methodology in place of carelessly repeated fable. He earnestly collected and studied early masonic manuscripts, writing the introduction for Hughan's published collection. He contributed greatly to an understanding of the enigmatic history of the York lodges in the eighteenth century. His lasting legacy may be seen in the continued activity and influence of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, and the rational approach to masonic history. Lastly, he played at least some part in the establishment of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, passing the cipher manuscripts from which it was founded to his friend William Wynn Westcott shortly before his death.Golden Dawn Biography of W. W. Westcott He had already made a strong case that the mystic and philosophical elements which allowed Freemasonry to evolve from a purely operative to a speculative society were likely to have been imported from some aspects of the Hermeticism practised during the Renaissance.A.

An escape chute is a special kind of emergency exit, used where conventional fire escape stairways are impractical. The chute is a fabric (or occasionally metal) tube installed near a special exit on an upper floor or roof of a building, or a tall structure. During use, the chute is deployed, and may be secured at the bottom by a fire fighting crew some distance out from the building. Once the tube is ready, escapees enter the tube and slide down to a lower level or the ground level. Description A metal tube fire escape chute on an old school building in Monroe, Nebraska. Although some early escape tubes were made entirely of metal, most current designs are made of high-strength fabrics, such as Kevlar. Their flexibility allows for compact storage, rapid deployment, and a gentler braking and controlled descent of users, as compared to traditional metal designs. Fabric tubes may also incorporate inflatable elements to lend some degree of structural rigidity and stability to the escape chute. The fabrics chosen must have fire retardant properties as well. In addition to fixed escape chutes permanently installed onto buildings, mobile escape systems are produced which can be mounted on the basket of a movable fire truck ladder, or temporarily installed to a building in an emergency. In response to images of trapped office workers in the September 11 attacks, personal escape devices for emergency use have been proposed, but only rope-based systems appear to be on the market for personal use. There was also the issue of fire heating the metal tubes, causing the people inside the metal tubes to become severely burned while exiting the building. Escape chutes are also installed in air traffic control towers where space for redundant stairwells is limited. Escape chutes were tested at the control tower at Kadena Air Base. History A small child is sitting in the end of the chute that allows escape from the second story of a brick building In Canada, metal tubes were installed on school buildings in the 1800s, including the original Alexander Muir public school, at Prospect and Timothy streets in Newmarket, Ontario. In 1948, the 136-bed Georgia Baptist Hospital in Atlanta featured a large fabric escape chute that was claimed to be able to empty the hospital \\"in only a few minutes\\".

Education Sonja Blomdahl bowl at the Tacoma Art Museum Blomdahl began glassmaking as an undergraduate student during the 1970s. She earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in ceramics from Massachusetts College of Art (Boston) in 1974. There she studied with glass sculptor Dan Dailey. In 1976 she spent six months studying at the Orrefors glassworks in Sweden, and her work is sometimes associated with Scandinavian design. Venetian glass master Checco Ongaro taught Blomdahl the method of double-bubble blowing (or incalmo), for which her work is well known. Career In 1978, Blomdahl served as a teaching assistant at the Pilchuck Glass School (Stanwood, Washington) for Dan Dailey, where she first watched Checco Ongaro demonstrate the incalmo technique. She has held teaching positions at the Pratt Fine Arts Center in Seattle; Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, Maine; and the Appalachian Center in Smithville, Tennessee. Blumdahl's first solo exhibition was at the Traver Sutton Gallery in Seattle in 1981. She opened her own studio in Seattle in 1983, which remained open until 2009.

It was heard in the Appellate Division from 13 to 20 December 1920, with judgment handed down on 19 February 1921. Innes CJ, Solomon JA, CG Maasdorp JA, Juta JA and Bristowe AJA presided.  Facts  The plaintiff company had a lease of the mineral rights in a farm. The defendant was the chairman of the board of directors of the company. The defendant was mandated to purchase the farm for the plaintiff company but could not agree the terms with the owner. The owner promised that if he ever wanted to sell he would give the defendant the first option. The defendant later bought half of the farm for ¬£60,000 through an agent. He thereafter sold it for ¬£275000 to the Watervaal Trust Company which was a wholly owned subsidiary of the plaintiff company. He never disclosed his interest in the transaction and he did not disclose his profit from it. When the plaintiff discovered what had happened they sued to recover the profit of ¬£215 000 from the defendant.  Judgment  The court held that the company was entitled to claim from the director the profit made by him, and that such a claim was neither a condictio indebiti, nor an action for damages, nor an action upon a contract, and that under the Transvaal ActAct 26 of 1908. the term of prescription applicable thereto was thirty years. The question of an amendment of pleadings, the court found, was one in the discretion of a trial court. The Appellate Division would not readily interfere with the exercise of such discretion. The decision of the Transvaal Provincial Division, in Randfontein Estates Gold Mining Co., Ltd v Robinson, was thus varied.  Significance  Where one man stands to another in a position of confidence involving a duty to protect the interests of that other, he is not permitted to make a secret profit at the other's expense or to place himself in a position where his interests conflict with his duty. A principal who discovers that he has purchased his agent's own property may elect either to repudiate the contract or to confirm it. If he wishes it to stand, and also claims the resulting profit, he must show that such profit arises from transactions completely covered by the prohibitive operation of the relationship between him and the agent. In any question as to the remedies available against a director of a company who has sold his own property to the company, regard must be had to the relationship in which the director stood to the company when he acquired the property. If he was under no obligation at that time to acquire the property for the company instead of for himself, his nondisclosure of the fact that the property was his own would entitle the company to repudiate the sale and restore the original position, but would not entitle it to retain the property at a price reduced by a reduction of the director's profit. When, however, the director's default extends further than non-disclosure, when a breach of duty attended the original acquisition, the company may, if it chooses, retain the property purchased and also demand a refund of the profits.

The lid is half open, and features an observation window and a ventilation opening, shown half-opened. It opens by pulling two chains that run from the top of the lid and through the hull, and closes by pulling chains running from below the lid and through the gun port. The lid itself has two layers: an inner layer made of vertical planks, providing structural integrity and watertightning, and an outer layer made of horizontal planks that integrates into the outer hull. A short roof above the gun port offers some protection from the elements, and prevents the lid from jamming against the hull. A gunport is an opening in the side of the hull of a ship, above the waterline, which allows the muzzle of artillery pieces mounted on the gun deck to fire outside. The origin of this technology is not precisely known, but can be traced back to the late 15th century, with the appearance of artillery in naval warfare. Ships featuring gunports were said to be pierced, since the ports were cut through the hull after the construction.  History = Origin  The origin of the gunport is difficult to specify. In France, it has often been attributed to Fran√ßois Descharges (or Deschenges), a master carpenter in Brest in 1501;. this is now known to be incorrect, since the ships of this era had long since adopted guns as their main armament.Dominique Brissou, dans . Examples of earlier occurrence are a 1498 terra cotta tile featuring a Portuguese caravel pierced with gunports; a relation of the Siege of Rhodes, printed in Ulm in 1496, that mentions a ship with 10 gunports; and a text that mentions that during the Conquest of the Canary Islands, Isabelle of Canary was thrown overboard through the gunport of B√©thencourt's ship. In Portugal its invention is attributed to king John II (1455‚Äì1495) himself,Garcia de Resende, Vida e feitos d' el-rey Dom Jo√£o Segundo, 1545, lines 8219 to 8220 who decided to arm his caravels with heavy cannons thus creating the first modern man-of-war. The first experiments with the new weapons were made in Setuvel (modern Set√∫bal) south of Lisbon around 1490, these small ships armed in this way could confront much larger vessels armed with the usual small swivel guns.Garcia de Resende, Vida e feitos d' el-rey Dom Jo√£o Segundo, 1545, lines 8200 to 8220 Guns were mounted in ships since the 14th century. By 1386, naval artillery had progressed enough for Jean Froissart to report a large ship \\"armed with three guns that threw such large quarrels that wherever they fell, they pierced everything and caused great damage\\". In 1380, during the War of Chioggia, Luciano Doria was killed aboard his ship by an enemy broadside. In 1340, during the Battle of Sluys, several of the French carracks bore guns powerful enough to sink several English ships.. But these guns were mounted in the ship's castles or in swivels, much in the way they were still mounted in the castles of the galleys at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. The power of a cannon depends on its calibre and its range, which in turn impact its weight. The first artillery pieces used in naval combat, traced back to 1304,. were light enough to be mounted on the forecastle, in line with the tactics of the time which favoured attacks facing the bow the enemy. However, the improvements of the guns from the mid-14th century dictated an increase in weight, forcing ships to mount them low on the hull for stability; piercing gunports had therefore grown into a common practice by 1501. Despite evidences, some historians claim the invention was probably simultaneous in Portugal, Spain, England, France and Holland.Jean Meyer, in . It was made possible by the increased size of ship hulls, which allowed piercing ports high enough that they would not take in seawater; nevertheless, the ports had to close with lids in heavy seas, and making them watertight was a technical challenge at the time.  Age of Sail  Technique = Broadside of the Oc√©an, showing the quincunx disposition of the gunport across superposed gun decks. The gunport makes it possible to mount large artillery pieces on a ship, turning it into an efficient artillery platform. From the 15th century, the number and quality of the artillery, conditioned by the gunports, became one of the features that distinguished warships from merchantmen. It announced the advent of the ship of the line and the demise of the galleys, which carried only a few guns on their forecastle. From the 16th century, the number and disposition of the artillery dictated the evolution of the silhouette of the ships, whose forecastle and quarterdeck faded and eventually disappeared entirely in the 19th century. Gun port of a 36-pounder long gun. Gunports were pierced on the side of the hull at equal intervals of 2.4 to 2.7 metres, though some were also pierced at the bow and at the stern of ships, for chase guns. Their size was adapted to the calibre of the artillery: for instance a gunport for a 36-pounder long gun was 1.2 metre wide. On ships with several decks, they were never pierced one on top of the other, but in quincunx, as to better distribute the load of the guns and the weaknesses of the hull. They were not mere holes in the hull, but artillery positions that had to withstand the weight of the cannons and the recoil forces of shots; to this end, they featured strong beams and rings to which the complex rigging that held the guns in place were attached. In effect, naval guns mounted behind gunports were more comparable to the guns installed in latter turrets, than to mobile Army field guns. Georges Fournier describes that in 1643, gunports closed with a top-mounted lid mounted in France, England and Holland, while they closed with side-mounted doors in Spain, and with removable panels in other countries. Some ships built with clinker, such as the Mary Rose, had to be rebuilt with a freeboard to be pierced. Gunports also provided aeration to the cluttered ships. To this end, it was possible to either open the lid, like when bearing the guns, or to open a smaller door in the lid. File:Carronade mg 5103.jpg File:Carronade mg 5104.jpg File:Carronade mg 5105.jpg = Flooding danger = In heavy sea, the gunports of the lower battery had to be closed, lest sea water flood the gun deck. The lower ports were a recurrent flooding risk, and caused a number of shipwrecks, like the Mary Rose in 1545 and the Vasa in 1628 (these ships also suffered from poor stability due to excessive weight in their tops) which sank when sudden gusts of wind made them list and lowered their opened lower gunports under the level of the sea. During the Battle of Quiberon Bay, two French ships of the line, Th√©s√©e and Superbe, foundered for a similar reason. The loss of Vengeur du Peuple and the Third Battle of Ushant was also probably caused by seawater flooding from the lower battery, whose gunport lids had been ripped off and shattered in the collision and subsequent gunnery exchange with HMS Brunswick. The French term for \\"scuttling\\", \\"sabordage\\", comes from \\"sabord\\" (\\"gunport\\"), reflecting their potential for flooding. = Tactics = Considerations of flooding had tactical implications. For instance, at the Battle of Ushant in 1778, the French squadron initially gained the initiative by sailing windwards from the British; however, as the sea strengthened, the French, whose ships were listing in the direction of the enemy, had to close their lower gunports, thereby losing their heavier artillery and a significant fraction of their broadside; since the British were on a parallel course, their list was opposed to their enemy, and they were free to bear all their guns. On 17 February 1783, the two-decker HMS Argo found herself unable to use her lower battery when two French frigates intercepted her. Similarly, during the Action of 13 January 1797, the French 74-gun ship of the line Droits de l'Homme fought the British frigates Indefatigable and Amazon in a sea so heavy that she had to seal her lower battery, leaving her with only 30 18-pounder guns, which effectively reduced her to the fighting qualities of a frigate; the British frigates, with their higher freeboard, remained free to use their full potential, and eventually forced the 74-gun to beach herself, even though they would not have been a match for a ship of the line in normal conditions. In the 18 and 19th centuries, merchantmen featured gunports, as they were useful to ventilate the ship and lighten the deck, and allowed to arm some merchantmen as warship in case of necessity; for instance, after the Mississippi Company was bankrupt in 1770, all its possessions were transferred to the Crown, and its ships were commissioned in the French Royal Navy. Furthermore, some warships could be armed en fl√ªte, removing guns from some of the gunports to make room for storage and men. This could make it non-trivial to discriminate ships in naval service from those that sailed for commerce. In the Action of 4 August 1800, the large East Indiaman passed herself as a 74-gun ship of the line when she chased the much stronger French frigate M√©d√©e; after sunset, she perfected the illusion by opening and illuminating all her gunports, whether armed or not; her appearance was so convincing that when she caught up with M√©d√©e, the frigate struck as if hopelessly overpowered. Conversely, in several instances, frigates attacked what they believed to be merchantmen, only to find themselves unexpectedly confronted with warships; for instance, this mistake caused the capture of the frigate Forte by HMS Sibylle on 2 March 1799. = Other use = A T√©m√©raire class ship of the line supported by chameaux inserted in the gun ports. Gunports could be used for a variety of purposes, beginning by loading or unloading supply, as emergency exit, or to board a ship. Around 1810, the French built several 74-gun ships in Venice harbour, which was deep enough to launch the ships, but too shallow to allow their departure. To reduce their draught, the ships were equipped with flotation tanks that supported them with beams inserted into their gunports.

Around the mid-19th century, the development of larger artillery pieces, like the Paixhans gun, led to mounting large guns on the deck of warships. For some time, on armoured frigates, batteries mounted behind gunports coexisted with these heavy guns, but they gradually lost ground against the barbette, where the gun was mounted on a rotating platform on the deck, possibly with a partial shielding, and eventually against the gun turret. The Battle of Hampton Roads, where the turret USS Monitor had the upper hand against the battery CSS Virginia, announced this trend. The philosophy of the gunport survived for a time with the central battery ship and the casemates of the secondary batteries of pre- dreadnought and dreadnought battleships, which were intended to repulse torpedo boats.

It was heard in the Witwatersrand Local Division by Boshoff J on March 17, 1970, with judgment handed down on April 28. The case is significant for its finding that a dividend cannot be declared which has the effect of diverting a portion of the corpus of the company to the shareholders. A dividend may therefore, generally speaking, only be declared out of profits, and a resolution which declares a dividend to be paid out of the capital of the company is ultra vires the company.706A-B.  Facts  Prior to the liquidation of a company, the defendant and one \\"H,\\" the sole directors and shareholders, had sold the fixed property of the company. They had then divided the proceeds of the sale between them, the company's accountant having debited their loan accounts with the amounts. Thereafter they had purported to distribute the proceeds between them as a declared dividend. The liquidator of the company sued the defendant for the pecuniary loss which the company had sustained as a result of the delict.  Judgment  The court held that, as the declaration of the dividend was ultra vires and of no force and effect, and as the money had been paid to the defendant as a loan, which loan still existed, the plaintiff had failed to make out a case for the payment of any money on the cause of action relied upon.

It is located in the village of Evenes, along the northern shore of the Ofotfjorden. It is the church for the Evenes parish which is part of the Ofoten prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of S√∏r-H√•logaland. The white, wooden church was built in a cruciform style in 1800 by the architect Johan Bernhard Kreutzer. The church seats about 460 people. History View of the church The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1589, but the historical Saga of Haakon Haakonarson says that King Haakon IV of Norway built a church in Evenes around the year 1250. An old story about the church states that the King had one of his ships drop a log into the Ofotfjorden and where the log landed on the shore was where the church would be built. The log washed ashore at Eivindn√¶s so that is where the church was constructed. Not much is known about the medieval buildings that housed the church in Evenes, but in 1652 it was described as a tall timber-framed church with a tower and an extended choir. In 1676, the church was described as being dilapidated. Records from 1750 show that the church had a graveyard that was surrounded by a fence made out of peat. In 1800, a new church was built to replace the old church. This building was designed in a Danish manor style with a Mansard roof. The new church wasn't fully complete until 1806. The old church was torn down and its materials sold in 1806.

There, he studied theology and canon law, becoming Baccalarius in decretis in 1412. He then obtained a doctorate in canon law, though the date of the degree is unknown.Vergara, p. 89. Izbicki, p. 49 ; His tomb inscription appears to indicate that he was Doctor in utroque iure (Civil and Canon Law). After obtaining his doctorate, Juan de Mella became a professor of canon law at the University of Salamanca. He was made Dean of Coria by 1421.Cerchiari, Emmanuele - Capellani Papae Et Apostolicae Sedis Auditores Causarum Sacri Palatii Apostolici Seu Sacra Romana Rota He was also a prebendary and a member of the cathedral chapter of the Cathedral of Toledo.Vicente Beltr√°n de Heredia, p. 313. Auditor of the Rota During the pontificate of Pope Martin V, he traveled to Rome as Procurator of King John II to defend Archbishop Diego de Anaya before the papal court. Anaya had been excessively loyal to Benedict XIII and was in danger of being deposed. Anaya had also been the founder of the College of St. Bartholomew, of which Mella had been a member. Mella then remained in Rome throughout the papacy of Pope Eugene IV. The Kingdom of Castile, where Mella originated, remained loyal to Eugene, while the Crown of Aragon supported Antipope Felix V. Mella was one of the prelates who represented Pope Eugene as an envoy to and substitute president of the Council of Basel in 1432. He also delivered an oration to the council of behalf of the pope.See Pope Eugene's letter to the notary and referendary Juan de Mella and two colleagues (7 May 1333), authorizing them to preside over the Council in the absence of the Cardinal Legates, who were detained in Rome on business.

Mella also served as regent of the Apostolic Penitentiary.Izbicki, p. 49. Adalbert Mischlewski, \\"Erg√§nzungen zur Biographie Juan de Mellas,\\" Bulletin of Medieval Canon Law 8 (1978) p. 55 . Mischlewski points out that Mella held the post of Regent in 1438, and is attested again in 1443. Bishop On April 12, 1434, the cathedral chapter of the Le√≥n Cathedral elected Mella Bishop of Le√≥n, to replace Bishop Alfonso de Cusanca who had been transferred to the see of Osma. Bishop Cusanca, however, declined his transfer, leading to Juan de Mella being renamed Bishop of Le√≥n on August 26, 1437.Eubel, p. 174. Throughout this period, however, he continued to reside in Rome. In 1440 Jean de Mella became bishop of Zamora, a position he held until 1465.Eubel, p. 271. Bishop Mella participated in the Council of Florence. He was a member of the commission that drafted the papal bull Laetentur Caeli, which attempted to reunite the Latin Church and the Greek Church. This bull resulted in the announcement of reunification at Florence Cathedral on July 6, 1439.Izbecki, p. 51.

Mella was transferred to the see of Zamora on April 6, 1440, while his brother Fernando became auxiliary bishop and vicar general of Le√≥n in his place. In Zamora Cathedral Mella endowed the chapel of San Ildefonso (now known as the capilla del cardenal after him) with five chaplaincies and an altar by Fernando Gallego. In 1455, Bishop de Mella was in Wroc≈Çaw, where he conducted a court case involving the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights and his subjects, and found for the former. He and the Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw received a letter from Pope Calixtus III ratifying their decision. Cardinal In the consistory of December 17, 1456, Pope Callixtus III made Mella a cardinal.

IJ Smuts appeared for the applicant, and MJ Lowe for the respondents. Section 49(2) of the Close Corporations ActAct 69 of 1984. gives the court the power to order the sale of a corporation asset in order to enable a member who is being prejudiced, as contemplated by section 49, to be paid out for his interest and thereby to bring about a termination of his membership.124A-B. There is no justification, the court found, in either the wording or the spirit of section 49 for limiting the court's discretion by interpreting section 49(2) as not authorising the court to order a corporation to sell its assets. The power of the Court to \\"make such order as it thinks fit [...] for regulating the future conduct of the affairs of the corporation\\" is not restricted to an order relating to the pursuance of the objects contained in the corporation's founding statement: i.e. an order relating to the running of the business of the corporation.122F, 121H. There were no authoritative pronouncements about the meaning and effect of section 49 of the Close Corporations Act. The section had not been considered by the court. But guidance was to be found in the authorities which interpret and apply the similarly-worded section 252 of the Companies Act,Act 61 of 1973. dealing with oppressive or unfairly prejudicial conduct in the management of limited liability companies.121I-122A. The object of section 49 of the Close Corporations Act is to come to the relief of the victim of oppressive conduct. The section gives the court the power to make orders \\"with a view to settling the dispute\\" between the members of a close corporation if it is just and equitable to do so. To this end the court is given a wide discretion. It may \\"make such order as it thinks fit,\\" within the framework of either \\"regulating the future conduct of the affairs of the corporation\\" or \\"the purchase of the interest of any member of the corporation by other members thereof or by the corporation.\\" These, the court noted, are far-reaching powers. One member can be compelled to purchase the interest of another at a fair price, whether he wants to or not.122D-F. There is no reason, the court found, why that portion of section 49 which provides for \\"regulating the future conduct of the affairs of the corporation\\" should be interpreted in such a way as to prevent the achievement of the underlying equitable principle of legislation relating to companies and close corporations as well as of the common law relating to co-ownership and partnerships, namely that no co-owner, no partner, no shareholder and no member is normally obliged to remain a co-owner, partner, shareholder or member against his will in circumstances where this is unfair or oppressive to him. The objects of section 49 of the Close Corporations Act are not advanced by limiting the Court's power to making orders relating to the day-to-day running of the ordinary business of the corporation. The court held that this section is designed for an extraordinary situation.123E-G. Section 49 of the Close Corporations Act places a similar onus on a member who considers that he is being unfairly prejudiced and seeks to invoke its provisions as does section 252 of the Companies Act. The member must establish \\"not only that a particular act or omission of a [corporation] results in a state of affairs which is unfairly prejudicial, unjust or inequitable to him, but that the particular act or omission itself was one which was unfair or unjust or inequitable. Similarly [...] where the complaint relates to the manner of conduct of the business, it is the manner in which the affairs have been conducted as well as the result of the conduct of the business in that manner which must be shown to be unfairly prejudicial, unjust or inequitable.\\"124B-G.

He is also the drummer and backing vocalist of the rock duo I Dont Know How But They Found Me. Musical career=Early years (2002‚Äì2011) In 2002, Seaman got his first touring opportunity to play on the Vans Warped Tour, drumming for Lookout Records artist The Eyeliners. In 2005, Seaman joined the band of post-hardcore I Am Ghost, recording some tracks for their debut album, Lovers' Requiem, released in 2006. In April 2009 he joined the pop rock band The Bigger Lights, participating in two albums and an EP, leaving the band in May 2011. He has also participated as a drummer with artists such as The Brobecks, My Favorite Highway and Aiden. Falling in Reverse (2011‚Äì2017) In late May 2011, Seaman officially joined the post-hardcore band, Falling in Reverse, replacing Scott Gee. The band released their first album, The Drug in Me Is You on July 26. Although he did not participate in the recording of the album, he is credited as part of the band. Seaman performed on the band's second studio album Fashionably Late, released on June 18, 2013. The band released their third studio album Just Like You on February 24, 2015. Around the time of the band's fourth and more recent release with Seaman, Coming Home, it was rumored that he had parted ways with the band. This was confirmed when the band performed on May 8, without Seaman and with Chris Kamrada now playing drums for the band. Icon for Hire (2017‚Äì2018) Prior to the controversy with Falling in Reverse, Seaman announced on April 6, 2017 that he would play supporting drums for rock band Icon for Hire starting May 3, 2017. I Dont Know How But They Found Me (2016‚Äìpresent) Seaman performed drums on Dallon Weekes' various solo efforts, which led to Weekes proposing the idea to present it as a duo under the name I Dont Know How But They Found Me. Seaman and Weekes started playing small shows in late 2016, but kept it secret. They debuted at Emo Nite Los Angeles' 2-year anniversary event on December 6, 2016. After the show, different sources wrote about a \\"new side project\\" by Seaman and Weekes, and confirmed the band name. Even when confronted with photos and videos taken at the shows, the duo denied the whole project for months, as they did not want to exploit their name recognition and association with the well-known bands they played in. Other projects In November 2014, Seaman was featured on Dallon Weekes' Christmas song titled \\"Sickly Sweet Holidays\\". Seaman also performed on Weekes' second Christmas single titled \\"Please Don't Jump (It's Christmas)\\", released in November 2016.

Whittier Education Campus is a public school located in the Northwest quadrant of the District of Columbia. History=Advocacy Prior to the building of Whittier Elementary School, children who lived in Manor Park attended Brightwood Elementary School. In 1923, the Manor Park Citizens Association passed a resolution requesting the building of a new school in the neighborhood, calling Brightwood Elementary School disgraceful and unsanitary. The association suggested the new school be built at Third and Rittenhouse Streets so the neighborhood's schoolchildren would not need to walk far to attend school. Senator Isaac Roop of Nevada submitted a bill to appropriate $150,000 for the construction of the new school in 1924. After a five-year-old child from Manor Park was struck by a car while walking home from Brightwood Elementary School in 1924, the Manor Park Citizens Association threatened to withdraw their children from school unless a new school was built in the neighborhood. The association noted that crossing two different street car tracks and walking along streets without sidewalks was not safe for children going to school. The superintendent, Dr. Frank W. Ballou, supported the idea, and the school board voted in favor of building the school. Construction Following a Congressional appropriation to build a school, the assistant superintendent visited several potential sites. A plan was developed to build an eight-room school at Fifth and Sheridan Streets, but the neighborhood association wanted a portable school opened until the permanent school was scheduled to be opened in 1926. The association also advocated for a sixteen- room school instead. The supervising principal of the area opposed the idea of a temporary portable school, saying that would result in 83 children from grades one through eight being taught in just one room. The association then refocused their efforts, requesting the renting of an eight-room building to be used as a temporary school. With support from the Takoma Park Citizen's Association, a temporary portable school was approved. After the school board removed funding to construct a permanent school from its budget, the Manor Park Citizens Association petitioned Congress to provide for a school with room for expansion. A portable school opened on December 15, 1924. Approximately thirty students in kindergarten, first, and second grades enrolled in the first year, taught by Miss R.F. Cogovan. In the second year, the teacher was Miss A.E. Rogers. In January 1925, the District's Congressional appropriation included $140,000 of funding to build a permanent school. Architect Ward Brown designed the school, and those plans were announced in July 1925. The school would be located on Sheridan Street between Fourth and Fifth Streets, and it would include a playground. Construction was to begin in August 1925, and the school was scheduled to open in May 1926. The land was purchased for $20,000. The Commissioners of the District of Columbia received three bids to construct the school, and all three bids exceeded the money appropriated by Congress; the lowest bid exceeded it by $20,000. The District rejected all three bids for exceeding the Congressional appropriation, and the engineer commission decided he would speak to Congress about the results of the procurement. The Manor Park Citizen's Association criticized the delays. Meanwhile, a similar situation occurred with the procurement of bids to build a different school on Calvert Street; the lowest bid for that school exceeded the Congressional appropriation by $7,000. The school board decided to modify the construction plans to keep within the appropriation and decided to begin construction. The engineer commissioner defended his decision to build the school on Calvert Street but not the school in Manor Park, saying that the excess for the Manor Park school was much greater, and speculating that the neighborhood would not want a school modified so greatly. The municipal architect assured residents that the school would ultimately be built in time to open in September 1926. Two days later, the District signed a contract with the contracting firm of Skinker & Garrett to build the school. In order to stay within the Congressional appropriation, the plans were revised to omit a principal's office, a health clinics, and a library. Construction began on September 29, 1925. Opening In 1926, the school was completed and dedicated to John Greenleaf Whittier. The school's first principal was Miss H.G. Nichols. A parent-teacher association was organized and raised funds to purchase playground equipment. The portion of Sheridan Street facing the school was paved in 1927. Expansion Following advocacy by the Manor Park Citizens Association, the District Commissioners approved adding eight rooms to the school, with construction estimated to be completed in July 1931. After soliciting construction bids in December 1930, the construction contract was awarded to the lowest bid, $83,940 from Graham Construction Company, and construction began in January 1931. Following the completion of construction in September, the expansion was officially dedicated in November. Construction of an auditorium for the school was included in the District's 1937 budget. Until this point, most meetings were held in a hallway, which had been nicknamed the Tower of Babel. Academics Whittier has had a science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) program since 2009. Whittier's curricula combines science, math, and technology with all major subjects. The school has a science lab and a computer lab. Students may also take classes in art and dance, and 96% of the students learn Spanish. As of 2011, 41% of Whittier's students meet or exceed standards in math, and 38% of its students meet or exceed standards in reading. In comparison, the average for the District of Columbia Public Schools system is 42% for math and 43% for reading. Athletics Whittier has an elementary school-age basketball teams for boys and one for girls. It also has a middle school-age basketball team for boys. Whittier has a middle school-age track and field teams for boys and girls. Whittier also has a tennis team, a cheerleading team, a swim team, and a baseball team. Student body Students who live in parts of Manor Park, Brightwood, Brightwood Park, and Riggs Park are zoned for Whittier. As for other schools in the District of Columbia Public School system, children who live outside Whittier's zone may enter the Out of Boundary Lottery for a chance to attend Whittier. Eighty-three percent of Whittier's students live within one mile of the school.

Jackson, Doc Shaw and Jim Belushi. The plot follows a boy who magically gets Durant's basketball skills and the duo must figure out how to return them. It was released on August 24, 2012. Plot Brian is a 16-year- old living in Oklahoma. Though he has tried out for the school basketball team, the Eagles, he has never made it, relegated to being water boy for the team. While practicing at home, Brian's sister makes a video of him injuring himself. She shows the video around school, and it is eventually seen by Connor, the star player of the basketball team. Brian takes a liking to Isabelle, a new girl at school, but is embarrassed when Connor shows the video of him to the whole school. In order to cheer him up, Brian's dad takes him to a Thunder game against the Detroit Pistons at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City. At halftime, Brian is chosen to shoot a half-court shot which he misses and hits Rumble, the mascot in the process. Later on, he meets Kevin Durant and expresses his desire to play just like him. When Durant signs the special edition Oklahoma City Thunder basketball that Brian got to shoot the half-court shot with, a surge of energy causes Durant's talent to transfer to Brian when he hands it over. The Thunder lose the game, with Durant shooting 0-13 in the 2nd half. The next morning, Brian learns that Connor, who was at the game, recorded him missing the half-court shot and posted it online. Later that night he goes out to a carnival and sees Connor fail to hit shots to win a prize for the new girl, Isabelle. Connor challenges him to \\"do better\\", which Brian is able to do, winning a prize which he then gives to Isabelle. Meanwhile, Durant's performance declines at practices, but insists he's only in a slump. After making several impressive shots at home, Brian decides to try out for the Eagles again. The coach, impressed by Brian's new skill, has Brian replace Connor as the team captain, and they win several games. Durant's agent learns of Brian and realizes that he is the same kid who missed the half-court shot. He tracks him down and explains that he believes Brian stole Durant's talent. He arranges for Durant and Brian to practice together to try to reverse it, but all attempts fail. Shortly before the final game, Brian and Isabelle begin fighting about how Brian has changed. Eventually, Brian goes to apologize and, while watching the video of him missing the half-court shot at her house, realizes what has to be done to give Durant his talent back. He rides his bike all the way to Chesapeake Arena and finds Durant. He explains that he hit Rumble before the transfer, and theorized that was what had to happen to reverse it. Brian hits Rumble with exactly the same ball he used to shoot the half-court shot, and then repeats the conversation that he had with Durant at their first meeting. Durant gets his talent back, and the Thunder qualify for the playoffs. At the final game for the Eagles, Brian is nervous about playing because he no longer has the talent. Though he plays rather poorly, with help from the other team members, including Connor, he still manages to lead his team to a close game and taking the final shot himself, makes the game-winning shot which sends the Eagles to the state playoffs for the first time in 32 years. Brian, who is gradually getting better at basketball, is later seen playing with Durant. Cast *Kevin Durant as himself *Taylor Gray as Brian Newall *Brandon T.

Stephen Lindsay is a cognitive psychologist in the field of memory, and a professor of psychology at the University of Victoria (UVic), British Columbia. He received his PhD from Princeton University in 1987. Lindsay's research is focused on human memory performance, the factors and processes that may lead to false memories, incorrect beliefs about past experiences and memory distortions, and the application of these areas to other fields, such as eyewitness memory and its effect on decisions in criminal investigation, and therapy in the context of the debate over recovered memories. Lindsay has achieved recognition in his field. He has published scores of journal articles, edited or co-edited several books and contributed chapters to many edited volumes. He was awarded the American Psychological Association Young Investigator Award in Experimental Psychology in 1995, served as Editor in Chief of the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General from 2001 to 2007, became a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science in 2005, received the University of Victoria Faculty of Social Science's Teaching Excellence award in 2006, and is currently Editor in Chief of Psychological Science. Lindsay became a faculty member at UVic in 1991, previously teaching at Williams College and completing a post-doctoral fellowship with Larry Jacoby at McMaster University. Education Lindsay graduated from Reed College in 1981 with a BA in psychology. After a brief period working as a construction labourer in Anchorage, Alaska, he began postgraduate study at Princeton in 1983; his doctoral work was supervised by well-known memory researcher Marcia Johnson. In his dissertation he initially set out to investigate the impact of imagining contrary-to-truth hiding places on children‚Äôs memory for the actual spatial location of objects. He became interested in Johnson's ongoing work on reality monitoring (the process of distinguishing between memories of external, physically experienced events versus those originating from internal sources such as imagination and thought). This led to work on the broader issues of source monitoring - how people decide where a given memory comes from, whether from own experience, a television broadcast, a story told by a friend etc. His final dissertation focused on source similarity - how alike two potential sources of a memory are - as a factor in increasing the likelihood of a source monitoring error. Research Lindsay's early research focused on source monitoring: what people do when they try to identify the origins of memories, knowledge and beliefs. With Marcia Johnson and other memory researchers, he was centrally involved in developing the source monitoring framework, a model of the processes involved in source-monitoring decisions. This body of work is cited extensively, had an impact on how memory processes are understood and paved the way for further research on false memories, memory distortion and the nature of metagcognitive judgments. He also investigated what factors could impact the accuracy and confidence of such judgments. His current research on memory performance includes work on improving recognition memory sensitivity. Lindsay became interested in memory errors partially due to the recovered memory debate, and has published work about the consequences of recovered memory therapy. and the nature and causes of recovered memory experiences. He has also studied the application of the psychology of memory to eyewitness testimony for many years, beginning with the implications of the source-monitoring framework for the accuracy of eyewitness evidence. His current work related to eyewitness testimony includes research on the influence of (often inaccurate) eyewitness evidence on investigators' decisions about the guilt of suspects.

Introduction During the Giolittian Era farmers were gathered into two distinct groups in Italy: *The SAI (Italian Society of Farmers), founded in Rome in 1895, which was engaged in lobbying activities and as a pressure group of farmers.Report on the reform of the Agricultural Society in the Italian National Institute of Agriculture, \\"Bulletin of the sessions of the Scientific-Technical Section and Section practical and propaganda of the National Institute of Agriculture\\", The (1922), fascicles. III, pp.. 113-122. *The CNA (National Confederation of Agriculture), founded in 1910 in Bologna, which was in charge of trade unionism in agriculture. To counter this situation, the government of Francesco Saverio Nitti issued the Visocchi-decree in 1919, followed by the Falcioni-decree in 1920, which allowed the granting of ill-cultivated and uncultivated land to cooperatives formed by war veterans. For the first time the State gave landless peasants the necessary legal instruments to claim the right to land, despite the ambiguities and red tape. Upon the return from the First World War, veterans returned to a promise for Latifundium, ill-cultivated land and uncultivated land to be distributed amongst them and cooperatives formed by veterans, under the Visocchi-decree in 1919 and the Falcioni-decree in 1920 under the government of Francesco Saverio Nitti. In this period there were many clashes known as the Red Biennium, in which many Italians rioted and picketed against high prices and inflation, known in Tuscancy as Bocci Bocci. (A linguistic contamination of the word Bolshevism)Roberto Bianchi: Bocci-buds. The food riots of 1919 in Tuscany, Casa Editrice Leo S. Olschki, Florence, 2001 This led to an expansion of a peasant movement with extensive and comprehensive land occupations due to a socialist hatred of veterans for the outcome of the war, who were often insulted in the street, some of which came under attack such as an Italian military officer Piero Operti who was amongst residents attacked by militant socialists.Piero Operti in Open Letter to Benedetto Croce stated in Pino Rauti Rutilio-Dale, History of Fascism, to the Government, the National Editorial Centre, Rome, p. 107: \\"Who's missing arm and unarmed, those of the leg, we were unable to oppose any reaction, we snatched the medals, the trampled, they did not do more, satisfied with the gesture or off the wrath of our liabilities, and diverged. We picked up our medals from dust and returned to the Hospital \\" During this period two unions where created during the clashes of the Red Biennium period, known as white and red alloys, the protagonists of the clashes. Large landowners sustained a campaign of Sbracciantizzazione, selecting farmers based on personal skills, and was aimed at reducing the number of workers per day (causing a reduction of 44% to 28% of rural workers who were not landowners), failed largely due to the small assignments of land.Faita PA, The agrarian policy of fascism: the relationships among the rural classes, production decisions, IRRSAE Piedmont Project history, Chivasso, 1995. The agricultural policy of Fascism A fundamental principle of the Fascist agrarian policy was to apply the principles of partnership, encouraging the different social classes to work together, as opposed to the system of continuous confrontation inherent in the visions of Marxism and Capitalism. In addition to his ideological leadership, Mussolini pursued a dictatorship of the proletariat, but favouring the peasants. The Duce aimed to create a new social class in Italy by the expropriation of large estates and the transformation of tenants into landowners and settlers.Antonio Pennacchi, Beam and hammer: Travel in the cities of the Duce, Yale University Press, 2008Pietrangelo Buttafuoco, from The Gazette dated 27 September 2008 Measures With the seizure of power by the Fascists, a new agricultural policy was undertaken, based upon concepts of independence and sovereignty of national markets, as well as fascist policies pursued in each sector towards foreign markets. Italy during this period was importing large quantities of grain, equal to one third of the national demand.In 1925 in Italy imported some 25 million tonnes of cereals, compared to 75 million tons of annual requirement. Information from Science Museum of Wheat, Nazzareno Strampelli here With Fascist aims of autarky, three main methods of intervention were pursued: *The sbracciantizzazione. *The reclamation and expropriation of large estates. *The Battle for Grain. =The Sbracciantizzazione= The Sbracciantizzazione was a policy pursued by the fascists with the aim of reducing or eliminating the \\"work day\\", and reducing the number of workers per day in favor of sharecroppers, tenants, and settlers, to develop small and medium properties, in favor of the development of employment contracts and encouragement of small holdings for the farmers and labourers.Autobiography of Fascism, Renzo de Felice (Bergamo, Minerva Italica, 1978) =Reclamation and expropriation= The basic law for land reclamation was the Lex Serpieri n. 3256 of May 8, 1924,Schmidt, 1937 aimed at land reclamation work in the Pontine marshes, with the establishment of the Land Reclamation Piscinara and reclamation consortiums (managed and funded by the state) which started channeling the waters of the river basin Astura, reclamation of swamp land, for the management of forestry and pastoral heritage.ACS, MAFF, B.203, II Parte. Report by President of Piscinara land reclamation consortium and the Pontine land commissar, November 5, 1930 In 1926 a royal decree was launched that established two consortia: the existing Piscinara Consortium, which was extended to encompass 48,762 hectares, and the Consortium of Reclamation of the Pontine region, 26,567 hectares, a relatively lower lying area, sites formed from the territories under sea level and consisted mostly of marshland, thus remediation of reclamation was more complex. Because Mussolini was unable to act alone and did not want to alienate the propertied classes, land reclamation relied heavily on state subsidies. By the end of the twenties however the situation changed and the control of the Consortium by the landowners was overcome thanks to the \\"Mussolini law\\" (elaborated by Arrigo Serpieri) of 1928, with which all the land that was unproductive or abandoned was expropriated by about two thirds, allowing for the passage of most reclaimed land to come under direct control of the State, which delegated it to the charity, Opera National Combatants and war Veterans (ONC) together with the management of all projects and land reclamation.Longobardii, Land reclamation in fascist Italy, (1936 pp. 197-243) Geography Library, Oxford University Between 1938 and 1942, the second phase of reclamation was introduced with places of interest being the Puglia and Campania, regions underwent rehabilitation work and continued during World War II , overall over a total of one million hectares of land was reclamed by the fascist state.PA Faita, agrarian policy of fascism: the relationships among the rural classes, production decisions, IRRSAE Piedmont Project history, Chivasso, 1995 In parallel with the reclamation, fascism carried out the expropriation of large land owners, and owners of thousands of acres of land largely left uncultivated and unproductive, these areas were sown with wheat or left alone to pasture resulting in revenues. The operations of expropriation brought good results in central Italy in Apulia, and less successfully towards Sicily, where the operations of the enormous extent of expropriation of large estates (500,000 hectares), occurred too close to the war to be successfully brought to completion. =The Battle for Grain= The Battle for Grain was instead a campaign (proclaimed on 20 June 1925) of autarky nationalist self-sufficieny in wheat production. It led to the establishment of the Standing Committee of the Grain, and in agreement with Mussolini, decided that the interventions of the state on agricultural production should cater mainly to the increase in the average yield of wheat per hectare, as a modest increase in the average would yield considerable results nationally. Accordingly, the Standing Committee of the Grain had to face three major problems: Seed selection, fertilizers, and the problems of technical improvements / pricing. With a series of legal measures aimed at modernizing farming techniques (natural and chemical fertilizers, mechanization of agriculture, etc.), the protection of domestic labour from outside competition and the development of state structures (such as itinerant agricultural professorships and agricultural consortia), excellent results were obtained.Osvaldo Failla and Gianpiero Smoke Agronomists in Lombardy: the itinerant teaching today, Franco Angeli. Results In 1931, only six years after the first measures of the new national agricultural policy (the launch of the Battle of the grain), Italy was able to eliminate a deficit on the balance of trade of 5 billion pounds and almost fully satisfy its need for wheat, reaching a production of 81 million tons (in the meantime it was necessary a small quantity of wheat in addition, due to population increase). In the same year in Italy there is also the record for the production of wheat per hectare production, the U.S., until then considered the first, it reached 8.9 tons of wheat per hectare, while the Italian was almost double counting 16.1 quintals per hectare. According to a 2020 study, the increase in increase in wheat productivity due to the Battle for grain had unintended effects on industrialization and growth, which persisted over the long term.

The Sino‚ÄìKorean Friendship Bridge, which opened in 1943, is only wide enough for a single rail track and a single reversible lane. Construction of the New Yalu River Bridge began in 2011, reportedly cost China $350 million USD to complete, and has multiple lanes to carry traffic in both directions.

Frederick Charles Shrady (October 22, 1907, East View, New York ‚Äî January 20, 1990, Easton, Connecticut) was an American painter and sculptor, best known for his religious sculptures. Biography The son of the sculptor Henry Merwin Shrady, he graduated from the Choate School in Connecticut, studied painting at the Art Students' League in New York City, and attended Oxford University in England. He moved to Paris, France, in 1931, studied under Yasushi Tanaka, and lived and painted there for nine years. He was awarded a medal at the 1937 Paris Exposition. He married in Europe, and returned to the United States in 1940, with his wife and young son, Henry. He joined the U.S. Army during World War II, and served as one of the Monuments Men, helping to retrieve looted art. In Bavaria, he met Maria Louise Likar-Waltersdorff (1924-2002), an Austrian translator with the U.S. Army Fine Arts and Monuments Department, who became his second wife. They had six children. He converted from Episcopalianism to Roman Catholicism in 1948, and turned to painting religious subjects. In 1950, he completed his first sculpture. Clare Boothe Luce's 19-year-old daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw, a student at Stanford University, was killed in a 1944 automobile accident. In her memory, Luce built Saint Ann's Chapel near the campus in Palo Alto, California, and commissioned works of art to adorn it. Shrady's colossal bronze sculpture on the building's facade, Saint Ann and the Virgin Mary, portrays the mother (St. Ann) teaching her young daughter (the Virgin Mary) how to read. He was commissioned by the Dominican Order in the Holy Land to model twelve bas-relief panels depicting The Life of Mary for the doors of the Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth, Israel. In 1982, Pope John Paul II commissioned him to create a statue of Our Lady of Fatima for the Vatican Gardens. He was the first American artist to receive such a papal commission. He was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French government, and was made a Knight Equestrian by the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, Israel. Maria Shrady wrote a number of religious books, including a children's book about Mother Teresa with illustrations by her husband.Maria Shrady, The Mother Teresa Story (New York: Paulist Press, 1987), illustrated by Frederick Shrady.

The Civil war and various depressions and recessions prevented its actual construction until 1871. Beginning in its early construction, it was largely financed and (later) owned by John Insley Blair, Blairstown, New Jersey (1802‚Äì1899), and Moses Taylor, New York banker (1806‚Äì1882). Taylor died in 1882 and his prot√©g√© Percy Pyne remained on various boards. The railroad was eventually known as \\"The Short Line\\". On February 7, 1884, the St. Louis, Hannibal & Keokuk went into receivership and was sold to Blair on December 8, 1885, for $370,000. At that point it became the St. Louis & Hannibal Railway Co. The Perry Branch was surveyed and graded in the 1870s but was not built until 1891-92. The first train reached Perry July 1892. This was a dual expansion in that track was extended from Oakwood into Hannibal and a brick depot was built at 501 S. Main Street in 1892. This would be the final configuration; Mainline - Hannibal to Gilmore, Missouri, and Branchline - Ralls Jct. (New London, Missouri) to Perry. In 1893 the St. Louis, Hannibal and Kansas City (Perry Branchline original name) merged into the StL&HRy.; John Blair died in 1899, at age 97, with an estimated estate of $70‚Äì90 million. His son, Dewitt Clinton Blair then assumed control. He died June 3, 1915. In 1917 the St. Louis & Hannibal went into receivership again and was sold to Robert LeRoy on behalf of Blair's grandson, C. Ledyard Blair for $30,000. It then was reorganized into the St. Louis & Hannibal Railroad. Around November 1919, the \\"Short Line\\" was sold to John Ringling (of Ringling Bros. & Barnum & Bailey Circus fame) for approximately $325,000. Between 1919 and 1930 he invested a further similar amount in rebuilding efforts. The depression was not kind to the St. Louis & Hannibal and Ringling. So, in 1932 the lower end of the mainline (below Bowling Green to Gilmore) was abandoned to save the rest of the system. John Ringling died December 2, 1936. His nephew John Ringling North assumed ownership of the railroad and circus interests. Only 5 miles of the southern mainline was saved and it became the St. Louis & Troy Railroad running from Troy to Moscow Mills, Missouri, and operated until October 1, 1960. It served local industries and was connected to the Burlington line by a siding at Moscow Mills. The St. Louis & Troy line was owned largely by local businessmen in cooperation with the Ringling family until 1944 when 25 businessmen solidified their ownership by purchasing it outright. Beginning in 1933, the StL&HRR; began operating four Mack AD model railbuses to bolster passenger service. It also ran dedicated freight trains as well. It helped for a time but eventually the owners and management abandoned the Perry Branch in 1943. The mainline was abandoned as well in 1944. The company was finally dissolved March 12, 1945. The St. Louis & Troy remained in operation but was finally abandoned February 1, 1961. This was the last remainder of the line which began life in 1857 and construction began in 1871. The railroad was largely not very profitable during its entire life as it served a remote area with small revenues. The building of hard surface roads (US Hwy 61), the ever-expanding Foster Bus Line routes, growing trucking industry and finally the personal automobile spelled its demise. Locally, the Short Line is still fondly remembered for its personal service and the kindness shown by owners, management and crews. Former Hannibal & St. Louis station in Bowling Green, MO.

Serpieri was an expert in agricultural economics, and was undersecretary of the Ministry of Agriculture during the Fascist period. He was also President of the Academy of Georgofili, Senator since 1939, and rector of the University of Florence from 1937 to 1942. Life Born in Bologna on 15 June 1877 he led his classical studies and attended the School of Agriculture of Milan where he graduated in 1900 with a dissertation on sharecropping. Since his youth Serpieri had attended the company of his uncle to S. Giorgio di Piano, which was considered advanced for its time. Initially he entered the Milanese school as a teacher of valuation, but in 1906 he moved to Perugia after winning the competition by a professor at the School of Agriculture of Perugia. He taught here for one year, returning to Milan the following year when he obtained the chair holder in his school of origin. In 1922 under the Ministry of Agriculture he began his collaboration with institutions, writing and directing the Forest Act, the following year under the Ministry of Nitti in the newborn National Forestry Institute of Florence. There he resumed teaching economics and valuation. Serpieri pushed to separate the study of forestry issues by studying the problems of mountain areas. In the First World War he served in the Army Corps of Engineers, as a lieutenant, but was soon assigned to the management of forest services and procurement, where he earned the title of captain. The Fascist Era From 1919 to 1935 Serpieri was awarded the President's Secretariat for the Mountain. In 1923 he became Secretary of State for Agriculture, where he remained for about a year. On liberal ideas, he maintained positions far from those of the vertices of fascists, although engaged in the Battle for grain, in order to increase the production. Serpieri would have preferred a liberal position if it where not for companies choosing production of wheat under a higher gain rather than at the desire of Benito Mussolini. Politically he belonged the National Fascist Party, and was close to the position of Socialist Filippo Turati. He was a supporter of small land ownership, competitiveness, and believed that the future would not be in the estate but in independent firms: Mussolini ignored the objections of Serpieri and proceeded with the methods he deemed best, leading, especially in the south, an explosion of landlordism and tenant farming, against the wishes of Serpieri. Serpieri had the merit of beginning the process of distinguishing between business economics and agricultural engineering, up to the time treated in parallel texts on agriculture in similar ways. He was to all intents and purposes a founder the agricultural economy, and was a leading proponent of the reclamation work accomplished during the twenties. He was also considered the father of the concept of land reclamation in Italy, and charged the organizing committee of the 1st National Exhibition of Reclamation that the regime organized in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the March on Rome. Amongst the works which shows the footprints of Serpieri there is the Luzzatti Law of 2 June 1910, which favored forestry freeing it from mere intervention of hydrogeological redevelopment. His contribution to Law 337 of 30 December 1923, further corrected the Forest Law, and remained until the current revision implemented in 1952, which transferred the jurisdiction of the state forest regions. Serpiere pushed the state to intervene in the financing of credit for agriculture, so as to encourage investment and the contraction of loans for business development. He tried to fight the big estates by Decree 753 of 18 May 1924, threatening to expropriate the landlords who have not turned their farms into modern companies. He reformed the organization of the Agricultural Schools, transferring skills to the Ministry of Economy (formerly divided between Economy, Education and Agriculture) and also creating agricultural technical institutes for the training of personnel with intermediate qualifications. From 119 29 to 1935 whilst Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, he launched the Consolidated Law on land reclamation (Law no. 215, Feb 13, 1933), which defined the type of state intervention in land reclamation and pushed in favour of remedial measures to mountain areas, as well as establishing various forms of financing, including grans, and defined as an integrated plan of construction work and services, required for the development of the country. The law was going to affect the interests of many wealthy landowners, influential in politics, which led to the marginalization of Serpieri within the hierarchies of government. In 1939 he was appointed Senator of the United XXX Legislature. After the war he played a political role in the secondary. He continued his studies and teaching since 1947.

The title-track and first single from Chasing Ghosts premiered on Alternative Press on 4 July 2012. Commenting on the song, frontman Joel Birch stated, \\"I wrote Chasing Ghosts as a narrative based wholly around someone that has committed suicide and has passed onto the other side. It's a story that I hope people will see for what it is; an example in song of why you should turn to someone close and talk instead of taking that last fatal step towards death prematurely. I just want to reiterate to people that once you're gone, that's it. There's no ghosts. There's no heaven, no hell, just finality and the wreckage left behind in the wake of their decision.\\" Cover art Shortly after this album was announced, the album's cover was revealed. The cover depicts a man hanging from a tree who is thought to have committed suicide. The graphic nature of this image caused much controversy among social media and fans. The situation was very ironic due to the main message behind the album being anti-suicide and urging fans who feel suicidal to turn to people close to them and seeking help rather than taking their own life. In June 2012, The Amity Affliction apologised for \\"vicious\\" statements made by the band in response to the controversy.

It is the seat of the bishop of Volterra. History The present church was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1117 that destroyed most of the town, and consecrated by Pope Calixtus II in 1120. Details of the earlier church on the site are not clear, although a church dedicated to Saint Mary is known from the 9th century. This was not the original cathedral, which was dedicated to Saint Peter and located next to the bishop's palace; it was destroyed by the Florentines during a siege in 1472, after which the bishop's seat was transferred to the present cathedral. Nicola Pisano is said to have been involved in further reconstruction in the mid 13th century. The rustic stone fa√ßade was built in Romanesque style using spolia from the Roman theater of Volterra in the portal. The intarsia over the door is attributed to Pisano.Attribution by Giorgio Vasari cited by City Hall website, entry on the cathedral In 1580, bishop Guido Serguidi, with the approval of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, commissioned the decoration of the intricately coffered ceiling of the nave and crossings, designed by Francesco Capriani, carved by Jacopo Pavolini, and gilded by Fulvo della Tuccia. The ceiling has sculpted reliefs of Saints Ugo, Giusto, Pope Linus, Clemente, Attinea, and Greciniana, round a central symbol of the Holy Spirit. The campanile of 1493 replaced an older belltower. Interior Interior in 1895 The elongated nave and interior space form a Latin cross. The nave spans 22 columns decorated with stucco simulating rose-colored granite. Much of the interior was restored in 1842-1843. The stucco capitals were completed in the 16th century by Giovanni Paolo Rossetti and Leonardo Ricciarelli. In the 19th century, the walls of the interior were painted in stripes that suggest typical Tuscan decorative church architecture. The floor has tiles of alternating dark and white marble. The pulpit has three reliefs depicting the Last Supper, the Annunciation, and the Sacrifice of Isaac, and the lions at the base of the columns are undoubtedly 12th-century works of the Guglielmo school, perhaps carved by the Pisan sculptor Bonamico. Other elements and the alabaster intarsia were added in 1584, when an earlier balustrade was dismantled and the pulpit was reconstructed. To the left of the entrance is the funeral monument of Francesco Gaetano Incontri, former archbishop of Florence, who died in 1781. The monument was erected in 1840, with a bust by Aristodemo Costoli and decoration by Mariano Falcini. Below the monument are eight marble intarsia panels, originally part of a 12th-century Tuscan balustrade. Ceiling The main altar, mainly dating from the 19th century, has a marble ciborium with flanking angels (1471) by Mino da Fiesole. The choir stalls were completed in the 14th century. In the ceiling of the crossing are depictions of God the Father and Stories of the Life of the Virgin (1585) above the choir by Niccol√≤ Circignani. Chapels In the first chapel, the Chapel of Saint Ottaviano, the relics of this saint are kept in a marble sarcophagus to the right of the altar, sculpted by Raffaello di Andrea Cioli. It was commissioned in 1522 to thank the saint for his intervention in stopping an epidemic of the plague; the candle holders depicting angels are by Andrea Ferrucci. Francesco di Valdambrino, Madonna dei Chierici To the left is the chapel commissioned by Ludovico Incontri in 1645. Its marble sarcophagus holds the remains of Saint Ugo dei Saladini, a 12th-century bishop of Volterra. The next chapel is the Chapel of the Madonna dei Chierici, referring to a wooden icon of the Madonna, donated by Jacopo di Ciglio (known as il Barbialla), and carved by Francesco di Valdambrino (early 15th century). The Chapel of Saint Paul opens off the north transept. This chapel was commissioned by the Inghirami family, built for Admiral Jacob Inghirami, and designed by Alessandro Pieroni. The admiral, in a scene including the Baptistery of Volterra, appears in conversation in the lunette of the Procession to Damascus above the altar. Giovanni Mannozzi (Giovanni di San Giovanni) painted the frescoes of the Life of Saint Paul on the ceiling. On the walls, are paintings of The Mission of St. Paul in Damascus by Matteo Rosselli and the Beheading of St. Paul (1623) by Domenichino. Above the door to the rectory hangs a canvas of The Immaculate Conception with Saints by Cosimo Daddi. Other artists that contributed to the decoration include Gherardo Silvani, Giovanni Caccini, and Francesco Curradi. Along the north side of the nave is the Chapel of St. Sebastian with a painting by Francesco Cungi of the Martydom of St Sebastian (1587). The cathedral contains the funeral monument of the humanist bishop of Cavaillon, Mario Maffei, who died in Volterra in 1537. The figure of the prelate dressed in his finery in a sleeping pose on the sarcophagus was executed by Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli, one of Michelangelo's assistants. The Oratory of the Virgin Mary (Cappella dell'Addolorata) contains a fresco of the Nativity with a Journey of the Magi by Benozzo Gozzoli on the left and an Epiphany on the right. Painted terracotta figures, almost life-size, have recently been attributed to Giovanni della Robbia. The Chapel of the Holiest Name of Jesus has an architectural 16th-century frame preserving the monogram of Christ donated to Volterra by San Bernardino of Siena encased in a precious silver 18th-century shrine. It also contains an Annunciation (1497) by Fra Bartolomeo della Porta. The Verani Chapel contains an Immaculate Conception (1586) painted by Niccol√≤ Circignani. The Chapel of the Annunciation contains an Annunciation by Albertinelli in collaboration with Fra Bartolomeo who painted the angel in the canvas in 1497. The first chapel to the right of the entrance, the Giorgi Chapel, has an altarpiece by Pieter de Witte, depicting the Offering of Volterra to Virgin and Saints (1587) commissioned by Captain Francesco del Bovino of the Giorgi family who appears in the left-hand corner of the painting. The second chapel to the right, the Collaini Chapel, has a Birth of the Virgin (1618) by Francesco Curradi, and the third chapel to the right, the Perissi Chapel, a Presentation in the Temple of the Virgin (1590) by Gianbattista Naldini. Over the door of the Chapel of San Carlo is a painting of the Crucifixion with the Virgin, Saints John, Anthony Abbot, Francis and Augustine 1611) painted by Curradi. Above the altar is a canvas of the Ecstasy of St Carlo Borromeo before the Virgin by Jacopo Chimenti, and on the side walls Saint Mary Magdalene of Scolaro by Guido Reni and an Immaculate Conception by Francesco Brini. Off the south transept is the entrance to the Serguidi Chapel (1595), previously the Chapel of the Holiest Sacrament, or Chapel of the Miracles, the design of which is attributed to Vasari. It was decorated in stucco by Leonardo Ricciarelli and painted by Giovanni Balducci. The cost of the decoration was more than ten thousand ducats. Above the altar is a wooden panel of the Resurrection of Lazarus (1592) by Santi di Tito. On the side walls are two paintings on canvas, also by Balducci: Expulsion of the Non-believers from the Temple and Parable of the Loaves and Fishes (1591). Balducci also painted the frescoes on the ceiling and to either side of the altar. Agostino Veracini painted the Patron Saints of Volterra (1741) featured on the walls. The altar has relics of Saints Attinia and Greciana. The Chapel of the Deposition has a group of five wooden polychrome figures representing the Deposition of Christ executed in 1228 by an unknown Volterran artist. Wooden sculpture of the Deposition The rectory stalls are the work of Francesco del Tonghio and Andreoccio di Bartolomeo, while the fine 15th- century intarsia on the bishop‚Äôs throne and the chaplain's benches are the work of unknown Tuscan masters.

Life cycle=Egg Females can lay 35‚Äì100 eggs. The greenish-white coloured eggs are laid singly in the stems of plants. The eggs could also be yellow coloured and can turn red by the time of hatching. They are in length and are wide. The eggs shape are cylindrical and are curved, which causes them to be mistaken for the eggs of tarnished plant bugs and pale legume bugs. However, the difference between the species eggs is that rapid plant bug's eggs have a distinct extension or spine. The incubation of the eggs takes 15‚Äì20 days of summer. Nymph The nymph have five stages of development and could appear either within 1.8, 2.4, 3.0, 3.8, or 4.8 days, with the total time of 15.4 days. When they appear, they are either brightly red or yellow coloured which depends on the stage in which they currently are. The start out as yellow coloured, transform to reddish-green by next stage, and ending up dark at the very last one. Their abdomen have a wide reddish-brown band that is located near the tip. The antennae have constantly changeable colour light and dark bands,m which usually are of either red or yellow. Both the species abdomen and thorax don't have dark spots that are usually found on the tarnished and pale legume bugs.

The hemelytra are brown other than for the lateral edges, which are narrow and yellow coloured. The antennae are black and are ringed with yellowish-white colour. The adult species also could fly, but not high, since the dispersal is not rapid. Enemies Little is known about the predators that hunt this species. In Ontario, they might get eaten by a Peristenus pallipes, a species of parasitoids. The assassin and ambush bugs are common predators too, especially in Alberta. Pest The species feed on alfalfa and sweet clover. They also enjoy feeding on vegetables such as beans, carrots, celery, and potatoes. But they don't stop there, they tend to feed on field crops such as cotton and sugarbeet and also on such weeds as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), Rumex and yarrow (Achillea).

Born in Newark, New Jersey, she was a child prodigy who received early art training from her artist-neighbor, Thomas Moran. Matilda Browne was active in Greenwich, Connecticut, New York City, and Old Lyme, Connecticut, where she was affiliated with the art colony centered at the Florence Griswold home. She was the only woman at the Old Lyme Colony who was taken seriously as a painter by her male colleagues, and she was considered an important member of the Old Lyme group.  Biography  As a child in Newark, New Jersey, Browne lived next door to the artist Thomas Moran famous for his landscapes and particularly for his large paintings of Yellowstone National Park. He allowed his 9-year old neighbor into his studio to watch him work before inviting her to experiment with paint, brushes and canvas on her own. Her natural talent was obvious. He encouraged her to take additional art lessons, and by age 12 one of her paintings of flowers was accepted into an exhibition at the National Academy of Design in New York. She soon became interested in painting farm animals and traveled with her mother to Europe in 1889 to study with animal painters in France and the Netherlands. Browne studied under a series of accomplished tutors ‚Äî Eleanor and Kate Greatorex (1854‚Äì1917, 1851‚Äì1913), Frederick Freer (1849‚Äì1908), Charles Melville Dewey (1849‚Äì1937), Julien Dupr√© (1851‚Äì1910) in Barbizon, and Henry Bisbing (1849‚Äì1933) in the Netherlands. After returning from Europe in the early 1890s, Browne returned to New York and began to exhibit in the metropolitan area. Most significantly, given her fondness for animal painting, she studied with Carleton Wiggins (1848‚Äì1932), a well known landscape and cattle painter. Browne exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. She worked in Greenwich, Connecticut, working at Cos Cob, Connecticut, in the late 1890s, and on and off throughout her career; she worked in Old Lyme, Connecticut from 1905‚Äì06 and periodically from 1911-24. Wiggins may have introduced her to the Florence Griswold boardinghouse in Old Lyme. Browne later rented a house on Lyme Street in the center of the village, believed to be shown in the background of In the Garden (1915).

In 1905, when she first visited Old Lyme at the age of 36, she had already won a number of awards and established a critical reputation. The other artists at the Griswold boardinghouse asked Matilda Browne to paint on a door and she contributed a pair of panels on the door leading to Miss Florence‚Äôs bedroom titled Bucolic Landscape, forming a scene of calves grazing beneath a tree. She was also the only woman to be included in The Fox Chase mural about the art colony that Henry Rankin Poore was painting over the dining room fireplace. These were extraordinary honors, since this all-male colony generally looked down on female artists ‚Äì as most obviously illustrated by Willard Metcalf who painted one young woman art student unsympathetically as Poor Little Bloticelli (1907). In 1918 Matilda Browne became the second wife of Frederick Van Wyck. She and her husband lived at his home on 142 E. 18th St, Manhattan, New York. In 1932 her illustrations were published in her husband‚Äôs book, Recollections of an Old New Yorker. After Frederick Van Wyck's death on February 16, 1936, Matilda Browne returned to Greenwich to live. Matilda Browne died in Greenwich, Connecticut on November 3, 1947 at the age of 78.

It was established in 1753. The academy has been a historic institution for over 250 years, and is best known for promoting, amongst scholars and landowners, the studying of agronomy, forestry, economy, geography and agriculture. History The Academy of Georgofili was established in Florence at the beginning of June 1753 as a response to an essay by the Lantern Canon and Abbot Montelatici Ubaldo, who proposed new horizons of agricultural research. It originated from the need to improve agricultural production through rational utilisation of the soil. In 1783 it merged with the Botany Society and received in concession the Giardino dei Semplici (medicinal herb garden). With the Grand Duke Peter Leopold of Lorraine, who granted it his protection, the Academia acquired notable prestige. The academy brought to attention many issues facing agriculture and agricultural economics, including the renewal of agricultural equipment, education, cattle, tenant farming, swampland draining, land reclamation, grain marketing, etc. The beginning of the Academy was not marked by activities of any special importance, the association rose to true pole of national agricultural progress in the nineteenth century, due to the studies in plow by Lambruschini Raphael and activities and research by Cosimo Ridolfi, one of the leading agronomists of the age of the Italian unification. Ridolfi proposed the reflection of greater clarity of the agronomic, geographic, economic, and social future of the land of hills that were for centuries the heart of Italian society, being marginalized by the advent of mechanized agriculture on the plains of Europe. In addition to agronomic studies of Ridolfi, the Academy was fruitfully engaged in the nineteenth century, in the production of wine and an awareness of the poor quality of a great majority of Italian wines, and the need to radically change the technology of the cellar on the forms on the pomological, and thus was born the largest catalog of varieties of fruit on the Peninsula, the Pamona of George Gallesio. On the night between 26 and 27 May 1993, an explosive device was set off in a Fiat Fiorino packed with explosives near the historic Tower of the Pulci, killing five people and wounding 48 others. The blast caused damage to the library of the academy, resulting in three years of restoration work in order to restore the building to its former state. The incident became known as the Via dei Georgofili bombing. Historical archives and library The historical archives covering the period of 1753-1911, with a total of over 12,000 manuscripts preserved, and the library is equipped with 70,000 volumes. The Torre dei Pulci, seat of the archive of the academy Name, motto, and emblem The term Georgofili comes from the Greek, and literally means \\"Earth- work-lovers\\", i.e.: \\"Devotees of agriculture.\\". The emblem of the Academy contains the symbols of agricultural activity, dedicated to the Goddess Ceres (I.e. an ear of grain, an olive branch, and a cluster of graphes) as well as those associated with economy activities and commerce dedicated to Mercury (caduceus, intertwined snakes and wings). The motto of the academy is Prosperitati publicae augendae (To increase the wealth of the state) and highlights how the activities of the Georgofili are towards public interest.

Rohan studied film theory and practice at the University of Melbourne. Whilst living in Los Angeles in 2008, Rohan assembled his first feature-length documentary T is for Teacher (2009), about the experiences of four transgender school teachers in American schools. The film screened at a number of international festivals alongside Oscar contenders later that year. It was named by two Australian reviewers as amongst the best films to screen in Australian cinemas in 2009. In late 2011, Rohan completed the feature documentary All The Way Through Evening, about music composed in the New York's East Village amidst the early years of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The film premiered in New York's East Village on 1 December 2011 (World AIDS Day). Rohan and the film's main subject (elderly concert pianist Mimi Stern-Wolfe) were invited as guests of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on World AIDS Day 2011 as part of an annual event held at Gracie Mansion. All The Way Through Evening opened theatrical to critical acclaim and four star reviews in Australia on 29 November 2012. Phillipa Hawker of The Age newspaper described the film as: \\"A graceful story of music and memory\\", rating the film four stars. Don Groves of SBS marvelled at Spong's ability to single-handedly bring the story to cinema: \\"Multi-tasking as director, producer, cinematographer and editor, Spong has crafted a handsome-looking production despite working on a frugal budget. It‚Äôs an impressive effort\\" and also gave the film four stars. Richard Watts of Artshub also gave the film four stars and named it amongst his most favourate films of the year, describing it as: \\"an important film, and a beautiful one.\\". Australian magazine FilmInk surmised the film as \\"an incredibly affecting and important piece of cinema\\". Despite only expecting to run for a week in each city, the film ran for a total of thirteen weeks at Melbourne's Cinema Nova, outlasting a number of big budget films including The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Celeste And Jesse Forever and Perks of Being a Wallflower, closing in late February 2013. All The Way Through Evening was nominated for the Australian Film Critic's Association Award for Best Documentary of 2012, but ultimately lost to the Best Documentary Oscar Winner Searching For Sugar Man. All The Way Through Evening finally opened theatrically in New York City at the Village East Cinema, on 6 December 2013. It was invited to screen at The Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. on 25 June 2014. Spong and the film's subject, Mimi Stern-Wolfe attended this screening. In 2014, Rohan announced that he was working on the follow up to All The Way Through Evening, entitled Winter At Westbeth. The film charts a year in the life of Westbeth Artists Community in New York City and profiles the lives of three ageing artists, including iconic Alvin Ailey and Martha Graham dancer Dudley Williams. It also features a brief appearance by All The Way Through Evening participant Mimi Stern-Wolfe. The film had its world premiere at the 60th Sydney Film Festival in June 2016, before screening at the 65th Melbourne International Film Festival in August. The film then screened in competition at IFC Center as part of Doc NYC, where it received a Special Jury Mention, before a screening at The Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. In November 2016.

A performance takes about 13 minutes. Composed in October 1853, it is one of Schumann's last compositions, composed three years before his death. By the time he began work on these pieces, he was suffering from mental and emotional decline. The set was composed just five months before Schumann's attempted suicide and confinement to a mental institution. The set is dedicated to \\"the high poetess\\" Bettina von Arnim. Schumann's wife, Clara Schumann, wrote in her private diary, \\"dawn-songs, very original as always but hard to understand, their tone is so very strange.\\" The Swiss composer Heinz Holliger wrote a work for orchestra, choir and tape in 1987 under the same title, ', which quoted Schumann and the German poet Friedrich H√∂lderlin.  Movements { align=\\"right\\" { ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } 2 } D major chord } The five movements are tonally organized by the three notes in the D major triad: D, F-sharp, and A. The first, second, and fifth pieces are in D major; the fourth piece is in F-sharp minor; and the third piece is in A major. 1\\\\. (In a tranquil tempo, D major) : The opening movement is like a chorale with rhythmic simplicity and a subdued, but rich texture. Many dissonant intervals permeate the transparent texture. The main melody is heard in stretto in the final two phrases. The entire movement has an almost religious sonority. 2\\\\. (Animated, not too quick, D major) : The movement is nearly entirely contrapuntal. The composer avoids showing listeners where the tonic key is. 3\\\\. (Lively, A major) : Probably the most virtuosic of the set, this movement has a constant, galloping rhythmic drive which continues throughout the piece. The octaves and large chords contribute to the heavy sonority. 4\\\\. (With motion, F‚ôØ minor) : A melody is mixed with a cascading accompaniment of 32nd notes. The music is restless and becomes agitated in the climax. 5\\\\. (First tranquil, then moved tempo, D major) : The final piece returns to a similar character and sonority as the first movement. A quicker 16th note accompaniment emerges from the thin texture. The lack of a strong final cadence brings this enigmatic piece to an ambiguous, but beautiful close.

Geographic range The subspecies C. a. helenae ranges from southern Ohio to northern Georgia in the east and from southern Illinois to eastern Louisiana in the west.Conant R (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. + Plates 1-48. (hardcover), (paperback). (Carphophis amoenus helenae, p. 175 + Map 131). Description When adult, C. a. helenae is small and wormlike, rarely growing longer than in total length (including tail). It is plain dark brown on top and light pink on its underside. The scalation on the anterior dorsal surface of the head is distinctive. Instead of having a pair of internasals and a pair of prefrontals, as are found in most snakes including other subspecies of C. amoenus, the midwestern worm snake has each internasal fused with its corresponding prefrontal. As a result, in the space between the rostral and the frontal, C. a. helenae has two large head shields, one on the left and one on the right, instead of the usual four smaller shields. Behavior, diet, and habitat The midwestern worm snake is fossorial. It spends its life burrowing in moist soil or under the leaf litter searching for soft-bodied prey, with a preference for earthworms. This secretive snake prefers mesic deciduous forest.

Edopoids are known from the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian of North America and Europe, and the Late Permian of Africa. They are among the most basal temnospondyls, and possess a number of primitive features that were lost in later members of the group. Description Life restoration of the cochleosaurid Chenoprosopus milleri Edopoids are relatively large temnospondyls, with many species estimated to have grown several meters in length. The skull of Edops is broad while those of cochleosaurids are narrower and elongated. Distinguishing features of edopoids include the presence of an intertemporal bone that is absent in all other temnospondyls, and the lack of a pineal foramen, a small hole on the skull roof of many early tetrapods (young individuals still possess this hole). Relative to other temnospondyls, edopoids also have enlarged premaxillae, maxillae, and nasal bones in the snout region, which constrict the nostrils to small holes and push them to the sides of the skull. Most edopoids lacked grooves in the skull called sensory sulci, which presumably supported a lateral line system in other temnospondyls. The lack of sensory sulci suggests that most edopoids were adapted to terrestrial lifestyles, as lateral lines are characteristic of aquatic animals. Nigerpeton is the only edopoid to possess sensory sulci, but only in its adult form. The skulls of edopoids have only one occipital condyle connecting them to the vertebrae of the neck, whereas more derived temnospondyls have two occipital condyles. Classification Life restoration of Edops craigi, the most basal edopoid Edopoidea was named as a superfamily of temnospondyls by American paleontologist Alfred Romer in the second edition of his textbook Vertebrate Paleontology, published in 1945. He recognized a close relationship between the families Edopidae (which includes only Edops) and Cochleosauridae. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the relationship between these two groups was supported by many phylogenetic analyses. One phylogenetic analysis separated Edops and cochleosaurids, finding the cochleosaurids to group with more derived temnospondyls like Archegosaurus. However, the skull characteristics used in this analysis are common to almost all temnospondyls with elongated skulls, and are not strong evidence of evolutionary relationships because long snouts could easily have appeared through evolutionary convergence. Most recent phylogenetic analyses support a sister group relationship between Edops and Cochleosauridae, meaning that they are each other's closest relatives. Edopoids are usually placed at the base of Temnospondyli along with other primitive forms like Dendrerpeton, Balanerpeton, and Capetus. Below is a cladogram showing the relationships of edopoids from Sidor et al. (2006): Paleobiology Most edopoids are known from the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian of Europe and North America, which at the time formed a larger continent called Euramerica. Procochleosaurus, the oldest edopoid, is known from Ireland, while Edops, the most basal edopoid, is known from the United States, strongly suggesting that the group originated in Euramerica. Tropical and subtropical environments were likely widespread across Euramerica during the Carboniferous and Early Permian, meaning that edopoids could easily travel between what are now North America and Europe. The edopoid Nigerpeton is known from the Late Permian of Africa, extending the time span of edopoids by about 40 million years and expanding their geographic range outside Euramerica. It lived in a mountainous tropical region near the equator that is thought to have been a refugium for temnospondyls during the end of the Permian. At this time, the equatorial region was likely bounded by deserts to the north and south, which were too arid for amphibious animals like edopoids.

Mothers who better understand their infant's signals are said to have higher maternal sensitivity. Maternal sensitivity is a mother's ability to perceive and infer the meaning behind her infant's behavioural signals, and to respond to them promptly and appropriately. Maternal sensitivity affects child development at all stages through life, from infancy, all the way to adulthood. In general, more sensitive mothers have healthier, more socially and cognitively developed children than those who are not as sensitive. Also, maternal sensitivity has been found to affect the person psychologically even as an adult. Adults who experienced high maternal sensitivity during their childhood were found to be more secure than those who experienced less sensitive mothers. Once the adult becomes a parent themselves, their own understanding of maternal sensitivity will affect their own children's development. Some research suggests that adult mothers display more maternal sensitivity than adolescent mothers who may in turn have children with a lower IQ and reading level than children of adult mothers. There are different ways of assessing maternal sensitivity, such as through the use of naturalistic observation, the Strange Situation, maternal- synchrony, and maternal mind-mindedness. There are also a number of ways of measuring maternal sensitivity in the scientific world, which include Ainsworth's Maternal Sensitivity Scale (AMSS), the Maternal Behaviour Q-sort (MBQS), and the Pederson and Moran Sensitivity Q-Sort. Description Maternal sensitivity was first defined by Mary Ainsworth as \\"a mother's ability to perceive and interpret accurately her infant's signals and communications and then respond appropriately\\". It was later revised by Karl and Broom in 1995 as \\"a mother's ability to recognize infant cues consistently and act on those cues, and the ability to monitor and accurately interpret infant cues, as evidenced by mother‚Äìchild interactions that are contingent, reciprocal and affectively positive\\". It can be generally defined as a broad concept combining a variety of behavioral care giving attributes. The research on maternal sensitivity follows earlier work in psychoanalytics and is especially rooted in attachment theory. As the focus of psychoanalytics shifted from individuals (particularly adults) to children, research studies on mother‚Äìinfant dyads, on the effects of early childhood on development, and on pregnancy became wider. A psychologist named John Bowlby eventually developed the attachment theory in 1969. Mary Ainsworth, who worked with Bowlby, along with her colleagues created the concept of maternal sensitivity in 1978 in order to describe early mother‚Äìinfant interaction observed in her empirical studies.Kemppinen, K. (2007). Early Maternal Sensitivity: Continuity and Related Risk Factors. Kuopio University Publications D. Medical Sciences 412. p. 19. There are four important aspects of maternal sensitivity: dynamic process involving maternal abilities, reciprocal give-and-take with the infant, contingency on the infant's behavior, and quality of maternal behaviors. Maternal sensitivity is dynamic, elastic and can change over time. A sensitive mother needs to be able to perceive the cues and signals her baby gives her, interpret them correctly and act appropriately. The three most positive affecting factors for the baby are a mother's social support, maternal‚Äìfetal attachment and high self-esteem. The three most negative affecting factors are maternal depression, maternal stress, and maternal anxiety. Recent studies have shown that maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can negatively impact a mother's sensitivity during stressful moments with her child that serve as traumatic reminders and that this quite likely has a neural basis in the maternal brain. Assessment=Naturalistic observation Maternal sensitivity is most commonly assessed during naturalistic observation of free play interactions between mother and child. There are several factors surrounding assessment during observation that may cause differences in results, including the setting (home vs laboratory), the context (free play vs structured task), the length of observation and the frequency of observation. While some observational studies focus strictly on the relationship between mother and child during close interaction such as feeding or free play, other studies look into how well the maternal figure divides her attention between the baby and other everyday activities. The latter was demonstrated in an experiment conducted by Atkinson et al. where mothers were given a questionnaire to act as a \\"distractor task\\", and were assessed on their ability to effectively divide their attention between the \\"distractor task\\" and their child. In regards to length of observation, some studies require no more than a one-time 10-minute assessment, while other studies used a much lengthier time. Strange Situation The Strange Situation was developed by Mary Ainsworth in the 1970s to assess attachment relationships between caregivers and children between 9 and 18 months old. Because maternal sensitivity is an indicator of attachment relationship, researchers sometimes use the Strange Situation to observe attachment so that they may use the results to predict and infer the level of maternal sensitivity. In the Strange Situation, the toddler's behavior and stress is observed during a 21-minute free-play session through a one-way glass window as the caregiver and strangers come into and leave the room. The specific sequence of events is as follows: # The mother and child are alone. Observation of the use of the mother as a secure base, who fosters exploratory behavior and independence. # A stranger enters the room, which shows the effects of stranger anxiety. # The mother leaves the child, which shows the effects of separation anxiety. The strange tries to comfort the child, which tests the effects of stranger anxiety. # The mother returns and the stranger leaves. Observation of reunion behavior. # The parent leaves and the child once more; separation anxiety is tested for. # The stranger returns and tries to comfort the infant; stranger anxiety is tested for. # The parent returns and the stranger leaves. Once more, observation of reunion behavior. The children are observed and categorized into one of the four attachment patterns ‚Äì secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, or disorganized attachment ‚Äì based on the infant's separation anxiety, willingness to explore, stranger anxiety, and reunion behavior. Mother‚Äìinfant synchrony and maternal mind-mindedness Two related qualitative concepts that are correlated with maternal sensitivity are mother‚Äìinfant synchrony and maternal mind-mindedness. In mother‚Äìinfant synchrony, the mother and infant's ability to change their own behaviour based on the other's response is taken into consideration. Infant affect (vocal and facial) and maternal stimulation (vocal and tactile) are good indicators of mother‚Äìinfant synchrony. Zentall et al. found that infants' rhythm was stronger and interactions were led better at 5 months than at 3 months. According to the study, an infant's ability to send signals and a mother's ability to perceive them increase with synchrony over time. Studies have shown that mother‚Äìinfant synchrony will result in the infant's development of self- control and other self-regulating behaviours later on in life. The related concept of maternal mind-mindedness assesses the mother's ability to understand and verbalize the infant's mind: thoughts, desires, intentions and memories. Maternal mind-mindedness has been found to be related to some developmental results, such as attachment security. A caregiver's comment is deemed an appropriate mind-related comment if the comment was deemed to match the infant's behaviour by the independent coder, if the comment associated the infant's current activity to past activities, and/or if the comment encouraged the infant to go on with his or her intentions when the conversation paused. This correlates to high maternal mind-mindedness. If the caregiver assigns the wrong internal state to the baby's behaviour, if the comment about the current activity is not insufficiently associated with a past event, if the comment deters the infant from proceeding with the current activity, and/or if the comment is unclear, it is deemed a in-appropriate mind-related comment and correlates to low mind-mindedness. Role of maternal sensitivity in development=Infancy Infants whose mothers are more sensitive are more likely to display secure attachment relationships. Because the maternal figure is generally accessible and responsive to the infant's needs, the infant is able to form expectations of the mother's behaviour. Once expectations are met and the infant feels a consistency in the mother's sensitivity, the infant is able to find security in the maternal figure. Those infants whose mothers do not respond to the signals from their children or respond inappropriately to their children's cries for attention will form insecure and anxious attachments because the infants are unable to consistently depend on the maternal figures for predictable and safe responses. In order for the infant to feel that the maternal figure is accessible and responsive, a certain amount of interaction must occur. Though the most research has been done on face-to-face interaction, studies have found that bodily interaction is also important in sensitivity and development. It is not how often the baby is held that reflects attachment, but how the baby is held and whether or not the baby desires to be held that matters in attachment development. Another factor that is important is sensitivity to the infant's feeding signals. There lies some controversy in whether infants who form insecure attachment relationships with their mothers do so because the mother is particularly insensitive to her child's needs or because of differences in their personality (i.e. their temperament) and due to life situations. Childhood Children whose mothers have higher levels of maternal sensitivity are generally happier, healthier, smarter, and better behaved. There is a crucial interplay between parenting and child characteristics such as health, temperament, development and cognition. The children with the most sensitive, consistent mothers are the ones who are generally most healthy, happy and well adapted. =Health in childhood= Maternal sensitivity even in the first few months of mother‚Äìchild relationships are an important factor to health in childhood, especially with obesity. A study using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development assessed mother‚Äìchild interactions and categorized them in one of two groups: sensitive or insensitive. Their child's growth (height and weight) was monitored throughout their childhood, from 24 months all the way to grade six, and body mass index was calculated. As the children grew, the percentage of overweight or obese grew too. From 24 months the overall overweight-obese percentage was 15.58% and by grade six, 34.34% of the children were classified as overweight or obese. More interesting is the difference between the maternal sensitive group and the maternal insensitive group. The children with the sensitive mothers started out with an overweight-obese percentage of 14.96% (24 months) and ended the research with 29.54% (grade six). The children classified with insensitive mothers had an overweight-obese percentage of 16.16% at 24 months and 39.28% at grade six. This shows a significant correlation between the mother's sensitivity and the child's risk for overweight-obesity during their elementary years. This is very important for obesity prevention programs for children. =Temperament in childhood= Current studies have shown a correlation between maternal sensitivity or insensitivity, negative discipline and childhood aggression. An experiment sampling 117 mother‚Äìchild pairs showed a unique relationship between the mother's sensitivity and the use of discipline and the child's temperament level. Observations (of the mother's sensitivity to the child's needs, the child's aggression and temperament level and the relationship between the two) were made when the children on average were 26.71 months old (range of 13.58 to 41.91 months). The data were collected again a year later. Results show a year later that negative discipline is correlated with child aggression, but only when that mother is insensitive. =Development in childhood= A study by Jay Belsky and R.M. Pasco Fearon tested the correlation between childhood development and the sensitivity of the mother. The hypotheses were: * secure attachment (observed at 15 months) and maternal sensitivity (observed at 24 months) produced the highest competencies in three-year-old children, * the least competent children would have a history of insecure attachment and maternal insensitivity, * and the children reared with mixed or inconsistency would fall in between. The children were tested in five developmental categories: problem behavior, social competence, expressive language, receptive language and school readiness. Results highly support the hypothesis (i.e. maternal sensitivity and childhood development are positively correlated.) This is an important issue as it shows how influential the early experience of a child affects their future development. =Cognition in childhood= Mothers who were found to display higher sensitivity towards their children from preschool to first grade were found to have higher achieving children than those who displayed lower maternal sensitivity. The children of maternally sensitive mothers scored higher in math and phoneme knowledge than those who had a history of lower maternal sensitivity. Maternal sensitivity has been shown to teach infants attentional skills, which are necessary later in life for emotional control, and other more complex cognitive processes. In families with more than one child (twins or triplets), it has been found that maternal sensitivity is lower, as there are more needs to be taken care of by the mother and less time to form a unique bond, which in turn results in decreased cognitive development in the infants (relative to if the child were raised alone). Furthermore, in the newborn period, women who displayed high maternal sensitivity had children who were able to regulate their emotions and who had higher symbolic and cognitive skills. In the case of the triplets, the child that received the least maternal sensitivity was the one that showed the poorest outcomes cognitively and had the most medical problems. =Socialization in childhood= Maternal sensitivity has been shown to have an effect on children's socialization skills. In particular, some research suggests that children of more sensitive caregivers have high levels of effortful (i.e. emotional and behavioural) control. Such control is proposed to have been fostered from the infancy stage when the a sensitive mother's quick and appropriate responses to the baby's distress teaches the baby to adjust his/her arousal. This speedy regulation of arousal is then adapted into childhood resulting in the ability to regulate emotion and behaviour well. Caregiver sensitivity has also been found to have a connection with empathy in children. Generally, securely attached children have been found to be more empathetic compared with insecurely attached children. The reasoning suggested for this result is that because securely attached children receive more empathy from caregivers during times that they themselves are distressed, they are more likely to show empathy in a situation where someone else is distressed. Adulthood Adults' own understanding of maternal sensitivity affects their sensitivity towards their own children. Adults who had insensitive mothers during infancy were found to not be able to remember specific childhood events or their importance. They were not able to present an accurate description of their parents by use of memories, they were found to idealize experiences and are more likely to remember situations in which they were rejected. Adults who experienced higher maternal sensitivity during both infancy and adulthood were found to be less dismissive and more secure than those who did not. Adults who are preoccupied were found to also try to please their parents as they were young, and have a sense of anger towards them. About half of the adults who were found more preoccupied than others were found to have experienced divorce between their parents earlier in life, as well as other negative life events such as death of a parent or sexual abuse. These life events cause the security of attachment between mother and child to decrease as the mother's availability, as well as responsiveness may decrease, no matter the maternal sensitivity experienced prior to these events. Male adults were found to have experienced less maternal sensitivity earlier in life than females and were more likely to be classified as dismissive than females were. Difference in maternal sensitivity in adult and teen mothers Maternal sensitivity has been found to be greater for adult mothers than for adolescent mothers. The level and quality of mind-mindedness, which refers to how prone the mother is to comment about the infant's mental activity during interaction, is higher in adult mothers, and has been related to greater maternal sensitivity. The comments made by adult mothers were found to be more positive than those made by adolescent mothers. Adolescent mothers used almost no positive comments, but instead negative comments. This causes the adolescent mother to be more insensitive to their baby's needs, possibly because of lack of need understanding, and therefore have lower maternal sensitivity and a less secure attachment to their infants. Maternal sensitivity in adolescent mothers can be predicted prenatally. Mothers who talked lively and positively about their future relationship with the child were found to display higher maternal sensitivity than those who did not (classified as autonomous mothers). Autonomous mothers were also found to have infants with a more secure attachment. Adolescent mothers who were not classified as autonomous were found to have anxiously attached infants. Furthermore, adolescent mothers were found to have children four‚Äìeight years old with lower IQs and a below-average reading level, than did adult mothers. Although adolescent mothers have been found to display lower maternal sensitivity, there is no evidence that maternal age itself has a negative effect on child development, as other factors at that age such as education and financial status may play a role in the insensitivity of the mother towards the child as well. Measurement=Ainsworth's Maternal Sensitivity Scale (AMSS) Mary Ainsworth developed Ainsworth's Maternal Sensitivity Scale (AMSS) to use as a measure in her Baltimore longitudinal study (1963). The scale is based on naturalistic observations completed by Ainsworth over a period of several hours and thus has no short procedure outline. Her method uses a nine-point scale (nine being very high and one being very low) in a number of important maternal traits. In order for this measurement to be accurate, it is essential that the researcher has developed good observations and insight into the behaviour of the caregiver. * Sensitivity vs. insensitivity to signals: This scale measures the how well the maternal figure is able to perceive and correctly interpret what the baby is giving signs of or signalling through behaviour and how appropriately the maternal figure is able to respond to them. The scale ranges from highly sensitive to highly insensitive. * Cooperation vs. interference with ongoing behavior: This scale measures how badly the maternal figure's timing of tasks interrupt the baby's own activities rather than with consideration to the baby's mood and interest. The scale ranges from conspicuously cooperative to highly interfering. * Acceptance vs. rejection of infant's needs: This scale measures the maternal figure's good and bad feelings towards her baby. The scale ranges from highly accepting to highly rejecting. * Accessibility vs ignoring: This scale measures the maternal figure's accessibility and responsiveness to the baby. The scale ranges from highly accessible to highly inaccessible, ignoring or neglecting. Maternal Behaviour Q-sort (MBQS) Maternal Behaviour Q-sort (MBQS) was developed by David Pederson, Greg Moran and Sandi Bento to measure maternal sensitivity. It has been used to measure a variety of studies including home based and video-recorded observations. The measures are defined using q-factor analyses.Moran, G. (2009). The Maternal Behavior Q-Sort (MBQS) ‚Äì Overview, Available Materials and Support. SelectedWorks of Greg Moran. The standard version of the Q-sort consists of 90 items that measure maternal sensitivity with regards to accessibility, responsiveness and promptness to the child's needs and there are many variations. In order to measure sensitivity, observers sort the items into nine piles of ten based on correspondence between the observed behaviour and the item. The maternal sensitivity score is calculated by comparing the descriptive sort and the criterion sort (prototypical sensitive mother). Pederson and Moran based their Q-sort on the Waters Attachment Q-Set, which is an assessment of the behavior of children.Pederson & Moran (1995). A categorical description of infant- mother relationships in the home and its relation to the Q-sort measures of infant-mother interaction. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 60 (2/3), 111-132. Pederson and Moran Sensitivity Q-Sort The Pederson and Moran Sensitivity Q-Sort was developed by Pederson D.R., Moran G., Sitko C., Campbell K., and Ghesquire K. in 1990. Similar to Ainsworth's Maternal Sensitivity Scales, the Pederson and Moran Sensitivity Q-Sort was designed to detect changes in maternal sensitivity with relation to infant behaviour. Related measures The Atypical Maternal Behavior Instrument for Assessment and Classification (AMBIANCE) scale was developed by Elisa Bronfman, Elizabeth Parsons and Karlen Lyons-Ruth. It was developed to measure the extent to which the parent failed to follow into the intentional or affective direction of the baby‚Äôs communications by engaging in contradictory responses to infant cues or failing to respond to infant cues altogether. AMBIANCE has the following five dimensions: * Affective Communication Errors (e.g., talks in inviting voice, but physically blocks infant‚Äôs access) * Role Confusion: (e.g., draws attention to self when infant is in need) * Disorientation: (e.g., appears confused, hesitant, or frightened with infant; incongruous affect) * Negative-Intrusive Behavior: (e.g., mocks or teases infant) * Withdrawing Behavior: (e.g., fails to initiate interaction, does not greet infant after separation) References Motherhood Perception ","title":"Maternal sensitivity"},{"id":"36076968","text":"I Love Jerome Kern is an album by pianist Kenny Drew recorded in 1957 and released on the Riverside label.Kenny Drew discography accessed June 8, 2012 The album was rereleased on CD by Lone Hill Jazz coupled with Drew's Pal Joey (Riverside, 1957) as The Complete Jerome Kern / Rodgers & Hart Songbooks in 2008.

Girona is located near the present-day Autov√≠a A-7, about halfway between the Franco-Spanish border and Barcelona, in Catalonia. Siege Spanish occupation of Girona threatened the French forces' lines of communication between Barcelona and Perpignan. An Imperial French corps led by Guillaume Philibert Duhesme attempted to capture the city of Girona and its Spanish garrison, commanded by Richard II O'Donovan, then a Colonel. The French began regular siege operations, but withdrew when another Spanish force led by the Conde de Caldagues attacked their lines from the rear. After the Spanish people rebelled against occupation by the First French Empire, Duhesme found himself badly isolated in Barcelona. The Franco-Italian corps was surrounded by swarms of Catalan miquelets (militia) supported by a few Spanish regulars. When the French general received news that a French division under Honor√© Charles Reille was coming to his assistance, he decided to capture Girona. Having failed to storm Girona in June, Duhesme mounted a formal siege operation. Duhesme's formal siege operations were interrupted by Caldagues' attack in mid-August. Though the Franco-Italian forces suffered few casualties, Duhesme and his soldiers became discouraged and they ended the siege. While Reille retreated to Figueres without much trouble, Duhesme's men were harassed during their return to Barcelona by the Spanish army and the British navy. By the time the French forces arrived in Barcelona, they were without artillery and badly demoralized. Meanwhile, Emperor Napoleon I assembled a new corps under Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr to relieve Duhesme from his predicament. The next action of the Peninsular War would be the Siege of Roses, from 7 November to 5 December 1808.

She released her debut EP, Apply, on May 26, 2009, followed by debut studio album Ring on September 24, 2010. Her second studio album, Interiors, was released on October 4, 2013. Early life Mesirow was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father is a member of the Blue Man Group in Berlin, and her mother, Casey Cameron, is one of the founders of new wave band Human Sexual Response. Following her parents' divorce, she relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area at age ten. She had some piano lessons as a child, and performed in musicals at school. Mesirow eventually studied German and literature at San Francisco State University, where she met Foreign Born singer Matt Popieluch, who helped draw out her songwriting abilities.  Career  According to Mesirow, the name \\"Glasser\\" was inspired by \\"a midnight vision of a figure hovering over water\\". In early 2009, Glasser's track \\"Apply\\" was featured on the eMusic compilation Selected + Collected and the song was later described by Pitchfork as \\"one of the disc's standouts [...] a great mix of electronic drag and skyward pop [that] showcased Mesirow's impressive vocal range.\\" In May 2009, Glasser played her first show without prerecorded parts, in support of her first EP, Apply. At that point Mesirow and Popieluch were living in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles and the act was described as \\"LA-based.\\" Mesirow was at the time working in the studio of artist Mike Kelley. Glasser's live shows featured performances by the dance troupe Body City and Mesirow wore custom outfits by local designer Ida Falck √òien. According to the LA Weekly, \\"'Apply' and its sister songs ‚Äî the swooning 'Learn,' haunted shuffler 'Glad' or the Kate Bush‚Äìmeets-Cluster 'Tremel' ‚Äî do sport the built-in intimacy common to good bedroom recordings, but they also possess hints of grandiose and mercurial qualities.\\" The Apply EP was followed over a year later by Glasser's first full-length studio album, Ring, co-produced by Swedish producer Van Rivers and the Subliminal Kid. According to Pitchfork, \\"there isn't an easy descriptor for Glasser's sound-- she incorporates bits of tropical pop, tribal percussion, and a couple of different strains of electronic music. Her songs sidestep traditionally linear arrangements for a more open, circular approach-- they kind of swoosh around without pausing at verse-chorus intersections.\\" Glasser's second album, Interiors, came out in 2013. The album was inspired, according to Mesirow, by Dutch architect and theorist Rem Koolhaas' 1978 book Delirious New York. The album's themes and sounds reflected the artist's move from Los Angeles to downtown Manhattan. \\"The interiors Glasser explores,\\" wrote Pitchfork, \\"most compellingly are, it won't surprise you at this point to learn, the ones within human beings. She applies the same ruthless precision to these ostensibly messier subjects, so that video selection \\"Design\\", an examination of physical desire that wields human breaths as percussion, is crystalline enough for a posh gallery. But the insides of people turn out to be at least as unknowable as those of buildings.\\" In 2018, Glasser resurfaced with the self-released, experimental EP Sextape, featuring spoken word descriptions of a variety of sexual experiences over danceable beats. Pitchfork commended the project for engaging \\"directly with the thorniness of queer intimacy, the complications that arise when queer people seek each other out to dance, to flirt, and to fuck each other.\\" Style Glasser has been compared to Joni Mitchell, Bj√∂rk and Cocteau Twins.

It formed on August 22 off the west coast of Africa, and for much of its duration it maintained a west-northwest track. The system intensified into a tropical storm on August 26 and into a hurricane on August 28\\\\. Passing north of the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane rapidly intensified as it approached the Turks and Caicos islands. It reached Category 5 status and its peak winds of on August 31\\\\. Subsequently, it weakened before striking northern Cuba on September 1 with winds of . In the country, the hurricane left about 100,000 people homeless and killed over 70 people. Damage was heaviest near the storm's path, and the strong winds destroyed houses and left areas without power. Damage was estimated at $11 million. After exiting from Cuba, the hurricane entered the Gulf of Mexico and restrengthened. On September 2, it re-attained winds of . Initially the hurricane posed a threat to the area around Corpus Christi, Texas, and the local United States Weather Bureau forecaster advised people to stay away from the Texas coastline during the busy Labor Day Weekend. Officials declared martial law in the city and mandated evacuations. However, the hurricane turned more to the west and struck near Brownsville early on September 5 with winds estimated at 125 mph (205 km/h). It quickly dissipated after causing heavy damage in the Rio Grande Valley. High winds caused heavy damage to the citrus crop. The hurricane left $16.9 million in damage and 40 deaths in southern Texas. Meteorological history The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical disturbance near the west coast of Africa on August 20\\\\. Two days later, the system organized enough to be classified a tropical depression just southwest of Cape Verde. For the next few days, the system moved west-northwestward with little change in intensity. It is estimated the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 26, about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. Initially, the storm was elongated, although beginning on August 28 it began to intensify more quickly. That night, the storm attained hurricane status, and many nearby ships reported gale force winds. On August 29, the hurricane passed north of the Lesser Antilles as it approached the southeastern Bahamas. It underwent rapid deepening: in a 24‚Äëhour period beginning late on August 29, the winds increased from 105 mph (165 km/h) to 150 mph (240 km/h). It also became a small storm, as Grand Turk Island reported winds of while the hurricane passed slightly to the north on August 30\\\\. At 0130 UTC the next day, a ship near Mayaguana reported a barometric pressure of and hurricane- force winds. The pressure would ordinarily suggest winds of , but because it was not reported in the eye and the storm was smaller than normal, the winds were estimated at . The hurricane's winds rank as a Category 5 on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale, one of two such storms in the 1933 season. After maintaining peak winds for about 12 hours, the hurricane began weakening as it passed through the southern Bahamas. At around 1200 UTC on September 1, the hurricane made landfall on northern Cuba near Sagua La Grande, with winds of about . The eye moved along the northern coast of Cuba, crossing over Matanzas. Shortly thereafter the storm exited into the Straits of Florida, and late on September 1 the hurricane passed about north of Havana. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane restrengthened, and a ship reported a pressure of late on September 2; this suggested winds of about . The hurricane turned more to the west on September 3, and as it approached southern Texas it weakened slightly as it decelerated. At 0400 UTC on September 5, the hurricane made its final landfall on South Padre Island in southern Texas, with winds estimated at 125 mph (205 km/h). It quickly weakened over land as it crossed into northeastern Mexico, and the storm dissipated late on September 5. Impact Rainfall totals in south Texas Throughout its path, the hurricane killed at least 179 people collectively in the Turks and Caicos Islands, Cuba, and south Texas. It first affected the Turks and Caicos, producing winds of on Grand Turk. Before the hurricane struck Cuba, officials warned of the impending storm, and military workers warned people to remain indoors. About 4,000 people evacuated the coastal town of Isabela on three trains specifically run for the residents. In Havana, business owners secured their properties in anticipation of the storm. Most of the deaths from the hurricane occurred in northern Cuba. Winds of over affected the coastline, and Havana reported maximum winds of . There, the winds downed power lines and uprooted trees. High waves flooded six blocks of the city with up to of water, entering the cellars of some homes. East of Havana in C√°rdenas, high waves destroyed the aqueduct, while high winds severely damaged the local sugar industry. A nearby coastal town east of C√°rdenas was described as being \\"virtually leveled by the storm\\" in news reports. In Cienfuegos along the southern coast, the hurricane destroyed many ships and piers. High waves washed four ships ashore, one of which damaged another ship. High winds destroyed hundreds of houses and damaged many others along the storm's path. About 100,000 people were left homeless, many of whom lacking food or medical supplies. In the interior of the country, the hurricane dropped rainfall that flooded rivers and towns. Damage was estimated at $11 million, and a report published in 2003 indicated that there were about 70 deaths in the country; however, newspaper accounts from shortly after the hurricane indicated there were around 100 deaths. After the storm, police officers were deployed to maintain order. Officers shot and killed five people caught looting in Havana, although the deaths were not included in the overall death toll. Officials deployed trucks to pick up wounded citizens. While the hurricane was over the Bahamas late on August 30, the United States Weather Bureau issued storm warnings for southern Florida. Two days later, the storm struck Cuba and passed south of the state, producing peak winds of in Key West. The winds caused little damage; however, high waves destroyed a sea wall and washed onto a coastal roadway. High waves also sank a boat, killing three people. Three days before the hurricane made its final landfall, officials at the Weather Bureau in Brownsville issued a warning to all stations along the Texas coast, declaring that it was \\"uncertain where tropical storm in Gulf will reach coast line, but all persons should be warned to remain away from inaccessible places on Texas coast over week end.\\" The early warning was to prevent travelers from being on the Texas beaches on Labor Day Weekend. As a result, an official at the Corpus Christi Weather Bureau office estimated that the warning \\"probably saved thousands of lives.\\" Early on September 4 about a day before landfall, the Weather Bureau issued a hurricane warning from Corpus Christi to Freeport and storm warnings for other locations along the Texas coast. When the storm's westward motion became more apparent, the hurricane warning was dropped north of Corpus Christi and extended southward to Brownsville. Officials in Corpus Christi declared martial law before the storm struck and ordered mandatory evacuations of low- lying areas. Shelters opened in the city, and many businesses closed. When the storm moved across the area, winds were estimated at in Brownsville, with gusts to . High tides were reported along the coast, and the storm surge reached near Brownsville. The tides flooded portions of Corpus Christi about deep, sinking boats and damaging piers. Storm-generated waves destroyed 20 buildings in one settlement. The storm destroyed the causeway from Padre Island to Flour Bluff, and there were over 40 breaches in the island, some up to a mile wide. The storm dropped heavy rainfall from southern Texas through northeastern Mexico, peaking at over at a station near Mercedes; the total was one of four 24‚Äëhour precipitation records set by the storm. The rains from the storm and two previous hurricanes led to a large increase in tropical butterfly species across the area. Throughout the Rio Grande Valley, the strong winds destroyed about 90% of the citrus crop. Overall, the hurricane left $16.9 million in damage and 40 deaths, mostly in Cameron County. However, none of the deaths were in Brownsville or Corpus Christi, which was credited to the advance warning. Damage was less than expected in Corpus Christi, and many business owners who lost revenue sent letters of outcry to the Weather Bureau Headquarters; however, the Bureau determined that the evacuations and warnings were warranted given the storm's threat.

The paper's final owner was Black Press, which also publishes the Alberni Valley Times and the Ladysmith-Chemainus Chronicle, and several other weekly newspapers on the island. History George Norris founded the paper as the semi-weekly Nanaimo Free Press in 1874. It began publishing six times a week, Monday to Saturday, 14 years later in 1888. In 1902, after George Norris died, the paper was continued on by his two sons, George E. and Wilf F. Norris, who later sold the paper to Thomas Banks Booth. in 1954, Thomson Newspapers bought the Free Press and the title eventually became Nanaimo Daily Free Press.

In the late 1990s, the newspaper became part the Southam Inc. chain, which itself was part of Hollinger Inc. This chain was, at the time, the dominant newspaper publisher in British Columbia, and also included the Alberni Valley Times, Times Colonist and several weeklies.

In 2011, Postmedia sold its Vancouver Island properties and Lower Mainland weeklies to Glacier Media for $86.5 million. In 2013, the Daily News attracted controversy and criticism for alleged racism for publishing a letter to the editor that opposed First Nations. Over 100 people, including the city's serving mayor, protested the publication. The Daily News eventually apologized for publishing the letter, then apologized again later that year for publishing a second letter which was also critical of First Nations. In 2015, Glacier Media sold all its island papers except for the Times Colonist to Black Press. In January 2016, Black Press announced the closing of the Daily News while maintaining its separate newspaper, the Nanaimo Daily Bulletin. The newspaper is proud of its stubborn insistence on referring to the citizenry of Nanaimo as \\"Nanaimoites\\" instead of \\"Nanaimoans.\\" Local literary lore posits that the early editors of the newspapers presumed that \\"Nanaimoans\\" was too difficult for a predominantly blue-collar readership to pronounce.Book Night, The Wheatsheaf Inn, Cedar, BC, July 23, 2012 Despite being advised that the people of Chicago are known as Chicagoans, not Chicagoites, and that the people of Orlando are known as Orlandoans, not Orlandoites, and further that the people of Toledo are known as Toledoans, not Toledoites, the newspaper's editors remain unmoved.

She is portrayed by Laura Allen. The character first appeared in \\"Pilot\\" and last appeared in the series finale \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\". Hannah was created and designed by series creator and executive producer Kyle Killen after he created and developed the series Lone Star for the Fox network.  Role in Awake  Hannah Britten is the mother of Rex and the wife of Michael. They live in a house in the fictional version of Los Angeles, California in the United States. In the red universe, she is currently a homemaker, while in the green, she is deceased.  Character = Creation  Kyle Killen (pictured) created Hannah after developing Lone Star for the Fox network. Kyle Killen was conceived of Hannah and the rest of the family and series in 2011 after a report that NBC had purchased the series from the creator Killen, under the original name REM. Killen had been called in to pitch a new drama for NBC, after Jennifer Salke, the president of the entertainment division of NBC, encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a new drama television series after the cancellation of Lone Star on the Fox network. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. \\"It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her,\\" recalled Korman. \\"I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work\\". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.  Casting  In March 2011, Laura Allen obtained the role of the character, alongside five other cast members.  Personality  Since Rex's death, Hannah has been very emotional, due to this. She began to renovate their home. Though she hardly showed it, she felt great pain and grievance over the death of Rex and was saddened by the thought of his empty room upstairs.  Reception = Analysis  The character of Hannah has been praised by many television commentators, who Allen felt effectively embodied the characteristics of the lead role.

The film is a road movie co-produced by Ecuador and Spain, and it stars Tania Martinez and Cecilia Vallejo as a Ecuadorian student and a Spanish tourist, respectively, that met each other in a bus and take rides together when the roads are blocked because of a strike. Hermida had the plot idea in 1997 but only started to produce the film in 2003. Filming was entirely done in Ecuador during 2005, while post-production finished in 2006. The directorial debut of Hermida, Qu√© tan lejos was meant to be an ironic reflection about identity and difference. The film satirizes folkloric-like and tourist-like images about Ecuador and Latin American in general. The journey the main characters go through reflect the director's reading of Mexican writer Octavio Paz's book El mono gram√°tico discussion about the search for a meaning. Some commentators noted the protagonist's trip is a self-discovery journey analogous to that of a Bildungsroman. The film internationally premiered at the 2006 Montreal World Film Festival, where it won a Silver Zenith award for directorial debut film. Following that, it was released nationwide in Ecuador in September 2006. The film was box office hit; it played for six months in theaters and attracted 220,000 viewers. This figure made the film the second most seen film in the history of Ecuador. Following a tour across other major film festivals in S√£o Paulo International Film Festival, Havana Film Festival, Guadalajara, and Moscow, Qu√© tan lejos was also released in Spain, France, Switzerland and Austria. Plot The plot follows an Ecuadorian Literature student, Tristeza (Vallejo) from Quito and a Spanish traveler, Esperanza (Martinez) from Barcelona as they unexpectedly travel together from Quito to Cuenca. Tristeza wants to stop Daniel, her summer love, from marrying and Esperanza just wants to travel when an Indigenous-led strike makes it impossible to travel by bus. They are then forced to improvise their way to Cuenca, taking rides from unknown people. After a first frustrated attempt, they take a ride from two journalists covering the strike. They are seemingly interested on the women but they abandon Tristeza and Esperanza after reaching the point where the road is blocked because they say they fear being attacked by Indigenous people. With no one at sight, Tristeza and Esperanza continue their way on foot. Tired and without knowing where to go, Tristeza and Esperanza meet Jes√∫s. He also needs to go to Cuenca because he needs to release the cremated ashes of his grandmother into the Tomebamba River so he accompanies the women. After stopping to eat something in Alaus√≠, they separate themselves as Tristeza gets a ride with a motobiker to Zhud. Meanwhile, Esperanza and Jes√∫s ride horses to a small village, where they meet Andr√©s, who gives them a ride. Esperanza and Jes√∫s meet Tristeza again and the three continue on their way along with Andr√©s. When they stop at a restaurant, Andr√©s tells he is going to the wedding of a friend known as \\"Pollo\\" (Chicken). Andr√©s description of the man matches Daniel's and Tristeza gets frustrated to know that Daniel is a womanizer who was already engaged when they met each other. Disillusioned, Tristeza gives up arriving before Daniel's wedding to stop it and instead the three go to a beach, as suggested by Andr√©s. They met Francisco \\"Iguana\\" and have fun at night. However, they sleep at the beach and when they wake up their belongings have almost been dragged by the sea, and Jes√∫s' grandmother ashes have gone into the sea. Jes√∫s, however, keeps carrying the pot and puts some sand on it. The three take a bus to Cuenca; they sleep on it and when the women wake up Jes√∫s is already gone, but has left the pot behind. Tristeza and Esperanza go to Daniel's wedding but they only observe from distance. Daniel sees Tristeza and does nothing so the women go away and get drunk, as Tristeza reveals her name to be Teresa. Finally, they release the content from the pot over the Tomebamba River. Cast *Cecilia Vallejo as Tristeza / Teresa *Tania Martinez as Esperanza *Pancho Aguirre as Jesus *Fausto Mi√±o as Andr√©s *Elena Torres as Shopkeeper in Alaus√≠ Production Qu√© tan lejos was the directorial debut film of Tania Hermida (pictured) The first feature film directed by Tania Hermida after working as an assistant director for Proof of Life, Maria Full of Grace and Cr√≥nicas, the idea of Qu√© tan lejos came during a stay in Madrid in 1997. The project for the film, however, only started in 2003, and had trouble to find fundraisers. The film had a budget of about 200,000 dollars and was produced by a 30-people staff. It was a co-produced by Corporaci√≥n Ecuador para Largo and Spanish company La Zanfo√±a; the Ecuadorian company was responsible for 75% of the film, while La Zanfon√£ worked in the remaining 25%. Filming took five weeks in the second half of 2005 and was entirely done in Ecuador across eight different provinces: Azuay, Ca√±ar, Chimborazo, Cotopaxi, Guayas, Manab√≠, Pichincha, and Tungurahua. Its post- production was finished by April 2006. The film's cast was composed by 20 Ecuadorian actors and one Spanish actress. It was also the first time protagonist Cecilia Vallejo acted on a feature film. Themes Hermida described the film as \\"an ironic reflection about how we construct our identities from the differences with the 'other'\\", and \\"how useless our certainties can be when confronted with the different\\". The director commented the film allowed several interpretations from the viewers, including what Hermida described as \\"how beautiful is Ecuador\\". However, ultimately, she declared that it \\"is about the impossibility of having an identity\\", and was done to show that \\"a landscape is not a country\\" and how the touristic image of the country is \\"nonsense\\". The depiction of the landscapes, customs and everything that could seem folkloric-like or tourist-like was meant to be ironic, according to the director. Ecuadorian newspaper La Hora said the film is \\"full of [...] nuances of irony about ourselves, about how we see ourselves and, through the character of the Spanish girl, about how we are seen from abroad\\". At first, Hermida did not think about the reason Tristeza would travel for. Eventually she came up with the wedding idea but did not plan to give it much importance as it was completely \\"anedoctal\\" and just a reason to talk about other things. The film's main theme was taken from a line of Octavio Paz's El mono gram√°tico that Tristeza reads in the first part of the film: \\"These words that I write are searching for their meaning, and that it is all their meaning consists of\\". As such, the film seems to end without a meaning but the meaning itself is the absence of a meaning. \\"A travel has no end\\", said Hermida; \\"it is cyclic, it ends where it started\\". Ecuadorian newspaper El Tel√©grafo seconded it, saying \\"The language through which [the film] speaks to us is an‚Äîendless‚Äîsearch for meaning.\\" The journey of search for a mening was described by some commentators to be similar to that of a Bildungsroman. Hermida also thought about her film as an \\"reflection on language and the impossibility of naming reality without transforming it\\". While an interviewer suggested Teresa's change of name exemplified it, Hermida added that the process of being a subject is an example since \\"everything is always in transformation: names, countries, identities, stories change depending on who tells them.\\" Hermida tried to depict Ecuador \\"away from Latin American stereotypes of violence and drug trafficking\\" and instead of it tried to focus on Ecuadorian everyday life. According to La Hora, \\"Hermida used the everyday to reflect a series of behaviors that identify Ecuadorians\\" and highlighted how the \\"anonymous characters\\" help on it; for example, the presence of \\"the typical\\" taxi driver who charges foreigners with an excessive fee or the \\"vividness\\" of a girl who sells candy at bus stations. Analysis El Tel√©grafo stated the film reflected a country that had gone through a recent \\"dollarization\\", that \\"survived thanks to the phenomenon of migration\\" and was politically unstable. Indeed, the film mentions a presidential deposition, which was assumed to be a reference to Lucio Guti√©rrez's removal from office. However, the script was already written and the staff was looking for locations in Alaus√≠ the day Guti√©rrez left his function. It was included by Hermida because then it was a recent fact that both Abdal√° Bucaram and Jamil Mahuad had not beeh able to finish their presidential terms. Another Ecuadorian newspaper, El Diario, also said the film \\"reflects a devastated, ungovernable country, but not from a tragic point of view, but with a touch of humor\\". Hermida commented that the humor indeed was a constant in the film, saying that what makes it different from other films is the sense of humor with which the situations the characters go through are handled. A writer for El Diario stated the character of Esperanza depicts and regular tourist \\"amazed at the third world\\", while Tristeza, described as \\"intellectual and somewhat conceited\\", \\"reneges her land to the utmost\\". Screen Anarchy Peter Martin commented how Teresa's introduction as Tristeza‚Äîwhich translates as \\"sadness\\" in English, to contrast to Esperanza's name, which means \\"hope\\"‚Äîwas a demonstration of her \\"contrary nature in general\\". This remain true all their travel; while Esperenza is \\"resolutely positive\\" and appreciate the surroundings, Tristeza thinks she is \\"dangerously naive, too much of a tourist\\" and contradicts her with social or political commentary. Jes√∫s works as the \\"wise figure\\" who provides lessons, according to El Diario, while Andr√©s embodies an upper-class stereotype. Martin commented that Jes√∫s is more like a narrative device \\"inserted to provide balance between the two women and deliver nuggets of wisdom\\". Release and reception=Accolades and public reception Qu√© tan lejos was not finished yet when it was first shown in October 2005 at the Cero Latitud Film Festival, where it won the Best Work in Progress Award. Its official public release only happened the following year during a preview screening in Cuenca on August 24, 2006. The film was set to premiere in early September but this screening was done because Qu√© tan lejos entered the Montreal World Film Festival and Hermida wanted it to premiere in her hometown. The film then was then screened in Montreal, where it won a Silver Zenith award for directorial debut film on September 4, 2006. The film has its nationwide release on September 9, 2006; it was a box office hit in the country, premiering in fourteen screening rooms and playing for six months at the movies. The 220,000 viewers made the film the nation's all-time second best local admissions total. In several theaters, it had more viewers than the American films, which dominate the Ecuadorian film market. Commenting about it, Hermida said this reflected the fact that \\"Ecuadorian people wanted to see themselves on the screen\\". El Diario labelled it \\"the Hermida phenomenon\\". In October 2006, at the S√£o Paulo International Film Festival, Qu√© tan lejos was nominated for \\"New Directors\\" category, and was among the 14 titles chosen to the Popular Jury Award. The same month it won the Best Film Award, Popular Jury Award, and Best Women's Film at the 2006 Cero Latitud Film Festival. The following month, it was shown at the AFI Fest. The film won the Second Coral Prize for directorial debut film at the Havana Film Festival in December 2006. In 2007, it also entered the Guadalajara International Film Festival competition section for Best Ibero-American Feature in March; the Moscow International Film Festival in June; and won the Jury Award at the S√£o Paulo Latin-American Film Festival in July. The film was distributed by Karma Films in Spain, where it premiered on September 21, 2007. There it was released in fourteen theaters and grossed $332,098 after eleven weeks. Karma's Paris-based Medula Films acquired the rights for the film in France, where it premiered on May 7, 2008 and grossed $94,592 during seven weeks. The film also had a limited release in Switzerland by Trigon-Film on November 20, 2008. The following month, it was shown at the Film Festival in Latin America in Geneva, where it won the Popular Jury Award; and it also premiered at the Latin American Film Festival in Malaysia at the National Visual Arts Gallery. In July 2009, after the film won the Innsbruck Nature Film Festival Popular Jury Award, it was chosen to play at selected theaters in Austria. It played for five weeks in three movie theaters for a total gross of $29,218. The Austrian, French and Spanish releases combined grossed $485,126. Critical reception El Diario praised the film for \\"avoid[ing] stereotypes and mak[ing] its plot exceed the predictable\\". The writer commended how the characters create a bond with the audience and especially lauded Fausto Mi√±o's performance as Andr√©s. While he found the story to be \\"familiar\\" and the storytelling \\"traditional\\", Peter Martin of American website Screen Anarchy said that what \\"provides substance are the very engaging performances\\" of the two main actresses and the way Hermida inserts commentary on Ecuador and its racial and national prejudice. Nuria Vidal of Spanish magazine Fotogramas compared it to Alain Tanner's Messidor and Maria Novaro's Sin dejar huella but said it is better because it avoids being tragic or dramatic. She also praised it for showing that a Latin American film can be good without exploiting misery. In a retrospective analysis in 2013, the film has been considered of \\"great quality\\" and to be part of a revival in Ecuadorian cinema by Fabricio Cevallos, writing for La Hora. Mar√≠a Bel√©n Guerrero of ChildFund recommended it as one of the ten best films of Ecuador by 2013. In 2016, El Tel√©grafo published an editorial celebrating the tenth anniversary after of the film's original release. The newspaper affirmed Qu√© tan lejos \\"told us about ourselves, it showed us our [own] places, it put us in front of our [own] people, [and] it made us feel interculturality\\".

According to the story, the calf signified that better times were soon to come and that future generations would live in prosperity.

Stark was the first Jewish umpire in modern baseball. Early life  Stark was born to a lower-class Jewish family in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Stark's father died when he was young and his mother became blind, and Stark was taken into a home for homeless children after being found sleeping on the street by a policeman. After leaving the home, Stark attempted to earn money for his family through playing baseball, and was nicknamed \\"Dolly\\" in a reference to Monroe \\"Dolly\\" Stark, an unrelated player for the Brooklyn Superbas. He was childhood friends with future Major League player Al Schacht. Stark played second base for several semipro and minor league teams, including the Newark Bears, Kitchener Beavers, Dallas Submarines and Jersey City Skeeters. He attended tryouts for the New York Yankees and Washington Senators, but failed both, in part due to his weight of only . At one point, a friend asked Stark to umpire a college baseball game in Vermont. He did such an outstanding job that he was asked to continue umpiring in college games. By 1927, Stark was umpiring in the Eastern League, but his performance was noticed and he was quickly promoted to the National League to succeed Hank O'Day.  Career  Stark's 1940 Play Ball baseball card As an umpire, Stark was known for being active and mobile, and constantly working to improve himself. He was the first to move around in order to be in position to make the right call.Burton A. Boxerman and Benita W. Boxerman, Jews and Baseball, Volume 1: Entering the American Mainstream, 1871‚Äì1948, Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, Inc., 2007, pp. 111-115. A player favorite, he was voted the most popular umpire by National League players in a 1934 poll sponsored by the Sporting News. In August 1935, league President Ford Frick presented Stark with a new automobile at \\"Dolly Stark Day\\" before a New York Giants game at the Polo Grounds. This was the first and only time a \\"Day\\" was held in honor of an umpire. Stark briefly resigned multiple times in his umpiring career. The first instance was midway through the 1928 season; Stark believed that he was not sufficiently doing his job as an umpire, but was talked out of this decision by fellow umpire Bill Klem. The second instance was after the 1929 season, due to Stark's self-described \\"torments of umpiring\\", although he returned once again in 1930. In 1936, Stark held out from umpiring, becoming the first known umpire to quit due to salary issues. (Stark was being paid $9,000 per year at the time, which is .). Stark told commissioner Ford Frick that he was not being paid adequately for his services, saying, \\"Unless the league sees fit to pay me a lot more money, I'm done. I want to do bigger work than umpiring and I want to get bigger money. I hope I can stay in baseball, either as a manager or business manager.\\" Stark ultimately spent the year as a radio broadcaster for the Philadelphia Phillies and Philadelphia Athletics.  Outside umpiring  In addition to his umpiring career, Stark coached basketball at Dartmouth College from 1923 until 1936, and was also a college umpire and basketball referee. He was coaching Dartmouth at the time that he was appointed a National League umpire. In 1936, he teamed with Bill Dyer to form the Philadelphia Phillies' first radio announcing crew on WCAU. Stark returned to umpiring in 1937, but ultimately retired in 1940 due to a knee issue. He attempted to find work as a scout, but was largely unsuccessful. (However, Stark was instrumental in getting Saul Rogovin a tryout with the New York Giants in 1944). Stark did find success as a women's clothing designer, starting a line called the \\"Dolly Stark Dress.\\" He also worked in other fields including textiles, stocks and bonds, and broadcasting. He was also the co-host of Your Sports Special, a sports news and interview show on CBS from 1948 until 1949.  Personal life  Stark's personal life included much tragedy; he was forced to spend large sums of money to support his blind mother, and his sister, who was constantly in poor health and ultimately committed suicide. His marriage to Betsy Lee in 1952 ended in divorce after 4 years, and Stark was in poor financial shape in his later life, forcing him to apply for unemployment compensation in 1968.

The Companion published articles on the history, theory, and practice of telegraphy, as well as United States Supreme Court opinions regarding Morse's patent disputes over the telegraph and Morse's own legal deposition regarding his claim to priority. In 1851, Shaffner built a telegraph line from St. Louis, Missouri to Jefferson City. Later, he organized the North Atlantic Telegraph Company, which projected building a line from Labrador to England through Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands. An advantage of Shaffner's proposal was that none of its segments extended below water for more than 800 miles. The British government took some interest in the project, but doubts about the long cable's feasibility undermined its funding, and the line was never built. Shaffner was chiefly self-taught. He studied law and was admitted to the bar but mainly pursued inventing. Shaffner invented several methods of blasting with nitroglycerine and other high explosives for which he received twelve patents. In 1864, he served Denmark in the Second Schleswig War.

The village is located at a crossing point of the Monaro Highway and Bombala River. The name is derived from a local Aboriginal word either meaning \\"Big Lookout\\" or \\"Place of Birds\\". History In 1833, notable pastoralist Joshua John Moore established a sheep grazing property named \\"Bibbenluke\\", and from this property a number of other stations in the area were also managed. The significance of Bibbenluke grew throughout the 19th Century, helped somewhat by an association with another pioneer, Scottish-born Benjamin Boyd. Boyd established the port of Boydtown near the town of Eden east of the Monaro in 1843 to support pastoral activities on his properties in the region. A school was established to serve the growing community around the station in 1871, and by 1884 significant commerce and industry had developed, with 3 carpenters, a stonemason, a blacksmith, a hotel and at least two stores operating in the town. An Anglican church operated out of a community hall on the sheep station around this time and the building was eventually relocated to the townsite in 1937. On 11 January 1915 the Men from Snowy River recruitment banner march from Delegate and Goulburn visited the town and enlisted 6 men from the local community to serve with the 1st AIF during World War I. A similar march along the same route passed through the town in April 1940 to recruit volunteers during World War II. In 1977, Bibbenluke Shire was amalgamated into the former Bombala Shire. December 1997 saw the opening of an upgraded bridge across the Bombala River, replacing the last remaining timber bridge on the Monaro Highway. Bombala was further amalgamated in 2016 to become part of the Snowy Monaro Regional Council. Present day Modern Bibbenluke is a small community that has close links with and relies on the larger town of Bombala for many public services. The school remains, although enrollments as of 2013 are now as low as 11 pupils. The community hall is the focal point of the village. Other historic buildings in town include the Anglican church and the original Bibbenluke Hotel, although this has been converted to a private residence. There is also a cemetery located in the village. The local economy is based mostly around farming and tourism, with a number of small businesses operating, including the historic Ben Boyd Guesthouse and Bibbenluke Australian Stock Horse Stud.

Adapting its name from the Greek word meaning \\"to shake\\" or \\"to contend,\\" the Enosinian Society was founded on March 6, 1822, by a group of 15 students as the debate and literary society of the new Columbian College. After the Columbian College changed its name to The George Washington University, the Enosinian Society changed its name as well, first to the George Washington University Debate Team, and then to its current name, The George Washington University Debate & Literary Society, so as to be more easily recognizable at public events and intercollegiate debate tournaments. The George Washington University Debate & Literary Society is the oldest student society at the University and its members remain dedicated to the society's founding purpose of \\"improving ourselves in knowledge, eloquence and every accomplishment by which we may be the better prepared for any station in life.\\" Currently, the \\"Enosinian\\" name is used for the society's alumni group and newsletter and GWU's Enosinian Scholars program. The George Washington University Debate & Literary Society is directed by GWU Director of Debate Paul S. Hayes. General Information The Enosinian Society was formed in 1822 during the first semester of the Columbian College. On March 6, 1822 students of the newly formed University gathering \\"for the purpose of establishing a debating society.\\" A constitution was drafted and the society adopted the name of the \\"Enosinian.\\" The original society met at Enosinian Hall, located on the fourth floor of the Columbian College's main building at College Hill, D.C. The society's first formal event was the celebration of Independence Day on July 4, 1822. In the fall of 1822, the Enosinian Society established its own library within the College's main library. The emblem of the society was adopted in 1824, and a banner was gifted to society by the ladies of Washington, which remained in the society's hall until the sale of the College Hill campus in the 1870s. Marquis de Lafayette visited Columbian College on December 13, 1824 and was greeted by the members of the Enosinian Society, who tended to Lafayette throughout his visit to the college. In return, Lafayette and his son agreed to be inducted as the first honorary members of the Enosinian Society. A bust was placed in the original Enosinian Hall in his honor and a debate tradition known as the \\"Lafayette Debates\\" was established. In 2013, the GWU Debate & Literary Society revived the Lafayette Debates tradition in partnership with the Embassy of France to the United States to create one of the most prestigious international civic debating competitions hosted in the United States. In 1827, The Columbian College suspended operations due to financial issues, and consequently the society suspended its operations. With the reopening of the college in 1829, students gathered to reorganize the society; however, regular meetings and debates did not resume until 1833. In 1838, the society established the Enosinian Bee, a weekly newspaper publishing the work of society members. The GWU Debate & Literary Society currently publishes an annual newsletter entitled, the Enosinian Bee. The society has suspended operations several times throughout its history. Operations were disbanded during the American Civil War due to low enrollment in the College after many students left to fight in the conflict. In addition to the GWU Debate & Literary Society carrying on the society's intellectual traditions, and the Enosinian Society being retained as the name of the GWU Debate & Literary Society alumni group and newsletter, the Enosinian name has been adopted by a number of student organizations that have emerged and died out since 2000 as well as the GWU Enosinian Scholars Program.
