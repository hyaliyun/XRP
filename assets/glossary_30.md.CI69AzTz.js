It refers to illegal internet-mediated activities that often take place in global electronic networks. Cybercrime is \\"international\\" or \\"transnational\\" ‚Äì there are ‚Äòno cyber-borders between countries'. International cybercrimes often challenge the effectiveness of domestic and international law and law enforcement. Because existing laws in many countries are not tailored to deal with cybercrime, criminals increasingly conduct crimes on the Internet in order to take advantages of the less severe punishments or difficulties of being traced. No matter, in developing or developed countries, governments and industries have gradually realized the colossal threats of cybercrime on economic and political security and public interests. However, complexity in types and forms of cybercrime increases the difficulty to fight back. In this sense, fighting cybercrime calls for international cooperation. Various organizations and governments have already made joint efforts in establishing global standards of legislation and law enforcement both on a regional and on an international scale. China‚ÄìUnited States cooperation is one of the most striking progress recently, because they are the top two source countries of cybercrime. Information and communication technology (ICT) plays an important role in helping ensure interoperability and security based on global standards. General countermeasures have been adopted in cracking down cybercrime, such as legal measures in perfecting legislation and technical measures in tracking down crimes over the network, Internet content control, using public or private proxy and computer forensics, encryption and plausible deniability, etc. Due to the heterogeneity of law enforcement and technical countermeasures of different countries, this article will mainly focus on legislative and regulatory initiatives of international cooperation. Typology In terms of cybercrime, we may often associate it with various forms of Internet attacks, such as hacking, Trojans, malware (keyloggers), botnet, Denial-of-Service (DoS), spoofing, phishing, and vishing. Though cybercrime encompasses a broad range of illegal activities, it can be generally divided into five categories: =Intrusive Offences = Illegal Access: ‚ÄúHacking‚Äù is one of the major forms of offences that refers to unlawful access to a computer system. Data Espionage: Offenders can intercept communications between users (such as e-mails) by targeting communication infrastructure such as fixed lines or wireless, and any Internet service (e.g., e-mail servers, chat or VoIP communications). Data Interference: Offenders can violate the integrity of data and interfere with them by deleting, suppressing, or altering data and restricting access to them. =Content-related offences= Pornographic Material (Child-Pornography): Sexually related content was among the first content to be commercially distributed over the Internet. Racism, Hate Speech, Glorification of Violence: Radical groups use mass communication systems such as the Internet to spread propaganda. Religious Offences: A growing number of websites present material that is in some countries covered by provisions related to religious offences, e.g., anti-religious written statements. Spam: Offenders send out bulk mails by unidentified source and the mail server often contains useless advertisements and pictures. =Copyright and trademark-related offences= Common copyright offences: cyber copyright infringement of software, music or films. Trademark violations: A well-known aspect of global trade. The most serious offences include phishing and domain or name-related offences, such as cybersquatting. =Computer-related offences= Fraud: online auction fraud, advance fee fraud, credit card fraud, Internet banking Forgery: manipulation of digital documents. Identity theft: It refers to stealing private information including Social Security Numbers (SSN), passport numbers, Date of birth, addresses, phone numbers, and passwords for non-financial and financial accounts. =Combination offences= Cyberterrorism: The main purposes of it are propaganda, information gathering, preparation of real-world attacks, publication of training material, communication, terrorist financing and attacks against critical infrastructure. Cyberwarfare: It describes the use of ICTs in conducting warfare using the Internet. Cyberlaundering: Conducting crime through the use of virtual currencies, online casinos etc.Understanding Cybercrime: A Guide for Developing CountriesÔºåITU Telecommunication Development SectorÔºå2009 Threats Similar to conventional crime, economic benefits, power, revenge, adventure, ideology and lust are the core driving forces of cybercrime. Major threats caused by those motivations can be categorized as following: Economic security, reputation and social trust are severely challenged by cyber fraud, counterfeiting, impersonation and concealment of identity, extortion, electronic money laundering, copyright infringement and tax evasion. Public interest and national security is threatened by dissemination of offensive material ‚Äîe.g., pornographic, defamatory or inflammatory/intrusive communication‚Äî cyber stalking/harassment, Child pornography and paedophilia, electronic vandalism/terrorism. Privacy, domestic and even diplomatic information security are harmed by unauthorized access and misuse of ICT, denial of services, and illegal interception of communication.Wipul Jayawickrama, Cyber Crime‚ÄîThreats, Trends and Challenges, Computer Security Week 2008, Info Shield, 2008 Domestic, as well as international security are threatened by cybercrime due to its transnational characteristic. No single country can really handle this big issue on their own. It is imperative for us to collaborate and defend cybercrime on a global scale. International trends As more and more criminals are aware of potentially large economic gains that can be achieved with cybercrime, they tend to switch from simple adventure and vandalism to more targeted attacks, especially platforms where valuable information highly concentrates, such as computer, mobile devices and the Cloud. There are several emerging international trends of cybercrime. *Platform switch: Cybercrime is switching its battle ground from Windows-system PCs to other platforms, including mobile phones, tablet computers, and VoIP. Because a significant threshold in vulnerabilities has been reached. PC vendors are building better security into their products by providing faster updates, patches and user alert to potential flaws. Besides, global mobile devices‚Äô penetration‚Äîfrom smart phones to tablet PCs‚Äîaccessing the Internet by 2013 will surpass 1 billion, creating more opportunities for cybercrime. The massively successful banking Trojan, Zeus is already being adapted for the mobile platform. Smishing, or SMS phishing, is another method cyber criminals are using to exploit mobile devices, which users download after falling prey to a social engineering ploy, is designed to defeat the SMS-based two-factor authentication most banks use to confirm online funds transfers by customers. VoIP systems are being used to support vishing (telephone-based phishing) schemes, which are now growing in popularity. *Social engineering scams: It refers to a non-technical kind of intrusion, in the form of e-mails or social networking chats, that relies heavily on human interaction and often involves fooling potential victims into downloading malware or leaking personal data. Social engineering is nevertheless highly effective for attacking well-protected computer systems with the exploitation of trust. Social networking becomes an increasingly important tool for cyber criminals to recruit money mules to assist their money laundering operations around the globe. Spammers are not only spoofing social networking messages to persuade targets to click on links in emails ‚Äî they are taking advantage of users‚Äô trust of their social networking connections to attract new victims. *Highly targeted: The newest twist in \\"hypertargeting\\" is malware that is meant to disrupt industrial systems ‚Äî such as the Stuxnet network worm, which exploits zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft. The first known copy of the worm was discovered in a plant in Germany. A subsequent variant led to a widespread global outbreak. *Dissemination and use of malware: malware generally takes the form of a virus, a worm, a Trojan horse, or spyware. In 2009, the majority of malware connects to host Web sites registered in the U.S.A. (51.4%), with China second (17.2%), and Spain third (15.7%). A primary means of malware dissemination is email. It is truly international in scope. *Intellectual property theft (IP theft): It is estimated that 90% of the software, DVDs, and CDs sold in some countries are counterfeit, and that the total global trade in counterfeit goods is more than $600 billion a year. In the USA alone, IP theft costs businesses an estimated $250 billion annually, and 750,000 jobs. International legislative responses and cooperation =International responses= G8 Group of Eight (G8) is made up of the heads of eight industrialized countries: the U.S., the United Kingdom, Russia, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, and Canada. In 1997, G8 released a Ministers' Communiqu√© that includes an action plan and principles to combat cybercrime and protect data and systems from unauthorized impairment. G8 also mandates that all law enforcement personnel must be trained and equipped to address cybercrime, and designates all member countries to have a point of contact on a 24 hours a day/7 days a week basis. United Nations In 1990 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution dealing with computer crime legislation. In 2000 the UN GA adopted a resolution on combating the criminal misuse of information technology. In 2002 the UN GA adopted a second resolution on the criminal misuse of information technology. ITU The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), as a specialized agency within the United Nations, plays a leading role in the standardization and development of telecommunications and cybersecurity issues. The ITU was the lead agency of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). In 2003, Geneva Declaration of Principles and the Geneva Plan of Action were released, which highlights the importance of measures in the fight against cybercrime. In 2005, the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda were adopted for the Information Society. Council of Europe Council of Europe is an international organisation focusing on the development of human rights and democracy in its 47 European member states. In 2001, the Convention on Cybercrime, the first international convention aimed at Internet criminal behaviors, was co-drafted by the Council of Europe with the addition of USA, Canada, and Japan and signed by its 46 member states. But only 25 countries ratified later. [8] It aims at providing the basis of an effective legal framework for fighting cybercrime, through harmonization of cybercriminal offences qualification, provision for laws empowering law enforcement and enabling international cooperation. =Regional responses= APEC Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is an international forum that seeks to promote promoting open trade and practical economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region. In 2002, APEC issued Cybersecurity Strategy which is included in the Shanghai Declaration. The strategy outlined six areas for co- operation among member economies including legal developments, information sharing and co-operation, security and technical guidelines, public awareness, and training and education. OECD The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international economic organisation of 34 countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. In 1990, the Information, Computer and Communications Policy (ICCP) Committee created an Expert Group to develop a set of guidelines for information security that was drafted until 1992 and then adopted by the OECD Council. In 2002, OECD announced the completion of \\"Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security\\". European Union coat of arms of the European Cybercrime Centre In 2001, the European Commission published a communication titled \\"Creating a Safer Information Society by Improving the Security of Information Infrastructures and Combating Computer-related Crime\\". In 2002, EU presented a proposal for a ‚ÄúFramework Decision on Attacks against Information Systems‚Äù. The Framework Decision takes note of Convention on Cybercrime, but concentrates on the harmonisation of substantive criminal law provisions that are designed to protect infrastructure elements. Commonwealth In 2002, the Commonwealth of Nations presented a model law on cybercrime that provides a legal framework to harmonise legislation within the Commonwealth and enable international cooperation. The model law was intentionally drafted in accordance with the Convention on Cybercrime. ECOWAS The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is a regional group of west African Countries founded in 1975 it has fifteen member states. In 2009, ECOWAS adopted the Directive on Fighting Cybercrime in ECOWAS that provides a legal framework for the member states, which includes substantive criminal law as well as procedural law. GCC In 2007, the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) recommended at a conference seeking a joint approach that takes into consideration international standards. =Voluntary industry response= During the past few years, public-private partnerships have emerged as a promising approach for tackling cybersecurity issues around the globe. Executive branch agencies (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission in US), regulatory agencies (e.g., Australian Communications and Media Authority), separate agencies (e.g., ENISA in the EU) and industry (e.g., MAAWG, ‚Ä¶) are all involved in partnership. In 2004, the London Action Plan was founded, which aims at promoting international spam enforcement cooperation and address spam related problems, such as online fraud and deception, phishing, and dissemination of viruses. Case analysis =U.S.= According to Sophos, the U.S. remains the top- spamming country and the source of about one-fifth of the world's spam. Cross- border cyber-exfiltration operations are in tension with international legal norms, so U.S. law enforcement efforts to collect foreign cyber evidence raises complex jurisdictional questions. Since fighting cybercrime involves great amount of sophisticated legal and other measures, only milestones rather than full texts are provided here. Legal and regulatory measures The first federal computer crime statute was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984 (CFAA). In 1986, Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was an amendment to the federal wiretap law. ‚ÄúNational Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996‚Äù. ‚ÄúCyberspace Electronic Security Act of 1999‚Äù. ‚ÄúPatriot Act of 2001‚Äù. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was enacted in 1998. Cyber Security Enhancement Act (CSEA) was passed in 2002. Can-spam law issued in 2003 and subsequent implementation measures were made by FCC and FTC. In 2005 the USA passed the Anti-Phishing Act which added two new crimes to the US Code. In 2009, the Obama Administration released Cybersecurity Report and policy. Cybersecurity Act of 2010, a bill seeking to increase collaboration between the public and the private sector on cybersecurity issues.Computer security A number of agencies have been set up in the U.S. to fight against cybercrime, including the FBI, National Infrastructure Protection Center, National White Collar Crime Center, Internet Fraud Complaint Center, Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice (DoJ), Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Unit of the DoJ, and Computer Emergency Readiness Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) at Carnegie-Mellon, and so on. CyberSafe is a public service project designed to educate end users of the Internet about the critical need for personal computer security. Technical measures Cloud computing: It can make infrastructures more resilient to attacks and functions as data backup as well. However, as the Cloud concentrates more and more sensitive data, it becomes increasingly attractive to cybercriminals. Better encryption methods are developed to deal with phishing, smishing and other illegal data interception activities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has set up special technical units and developed Carnivore, a computer surveillance system which can intercept all packets that are sent to and from the ISP where it is installed, to assist in the investigation of cybercrime. Industry collaboration Public-private partnership: in 2006, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) signed an agreement with the United States Department of Commerce (United States Department of Commerce) that they partnered through the Multistakeholder Model of consultation. In 2008, the second annual Cyber Storm conference was exercised, involving nine states, four foreign governments, 18 federal agencies and 40 private companies. In 2010, National Cyber Security Alliance‚Äôs public awareness campaign was launched in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Trade Commission, and others. Incentives for ISP: Though the cost of security measures increases, Internet Service Providers (ISP) are encouraged to fight against cybercrime to win consumer support, good reputation and brand image among consumer and peer ISP as well. International cooperation USA has signed and also ratified Convention on Cybercrime. United States has actively participated in G8/OECD/APEC/OAS/U.S.-China cooperation in cracking down international cyber crime. Future challenges Privacy in tracking down cybercrime is being challenged and becomes a controversial issue. Public-private partnership. As the U.S. government gets more involved in the development of IT products, many companies worry this may stifle their innovation, even undermining efforts to develop more secure technology products. New legislative proposals now being considered by the U.S. Congress could be potentially intrusive on private industry, which may prevent enterprises from responding effectively to emerging and changing threats. Cyber attacks and security breaches are increasing in frequency and sophistication, they are targeting organizations and individuals with malware and anonymization techniques that can evade current security controls. Current perimeter-intrusion detection, signature- based malware, and anti-virus solutions are providing little defense. Relatively few organizations have recognized organized cyber criminal networks, rather than hackers, as their greatest potential cyber security threat; even fewer are prepared to address this threat. =China= In January 2009, China was ranked No.3 spam-producing country in the world, according to data compiled by security vendor Sophos. Sophos now ranks China as spam producer No.20, right behind Spain. China's underground economy is booming with estimated 10 billion RMB in 2009. Hacking, malware and spam are immensely popular. With patriotic hacktivism, people hack to defend the country. Legal and regulatory measures Criminal Law ‚Äì the basic law identifies the law enforcement concerning cybercrime. In 2000, the Decision on Internet Security of the Standing Committee of the NPC was passed. In 2000, China issued a series of Internet rules that prohibit anyone to propagate pornography, virus and scams. In 2003, China signed UN General Assembly Resolution 57/239 on ‚ÄúCreation of a global culture of cybersecurity‚Äù. In 2003, China signed Geneva Declaration of Principles of the World Summit on the Information Society. In 2006, an anti-spam initiative was launched. In July 2006, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which included China, issued a statement that its members should implement cybercrime and cybersecurity laws ‚Äúin accordance with their national conditions and by referring to relevant international instruments‚Äù. In 2009, ASEAN-China framework agreement on network and information security emergency response were adopted. In 2009, agreement within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on information security was made. Technical measures Internet censorship: China has made it tougher to register new Internet domains and has put on stricter content control to help reduce spam. \\"Golden Shield Project\\" or \\"The Great Firewall of China\\": a national Internet control and censorship project. In 2009, Green Dam software: It restricts access to a secret list of sites, and monitors users‚Äôactivity. Operating system change: China is trying to get around this by using Linux, though with a lot of technical impediments to solve. Industry collaboration Internet Society of China ‚Äî the group behind China's anti- spam effort ‚Äî is working on standards and better ways of cooperating to fight cybercrime. ISPs have become better at working with customers to cut down on the spam problem. International cooperation In 2005, China signed up for the London Action Plan on spam, an international effort to curb the problem. Anti-Spam ‚ÄúBeijing Declaration‚Äù2006 International Anti-Spam Summit was held. The APEC Working Group on Telecommunications agreed an action plan for 2010‚Äì2015 that included ‚Äúfostering a safe and trusted ICT environment‚Äù. In January 2011, the United States and China committed for the first time at head of state level to work together on a bilateral basis on issues of cybersecurity. \\"Fighting Spam to Build Trust\\" will be the first effort to help overcome the trust deficit between China and the United States on cybersecurity. Cyber Security China Summit 2011 will be held in Shanghai. Achievement and future challenges Successfully cracking down spam volume in 2009. However, insufficient criminal laws and regulations are great impediments in fighting cybercrime. A lack of electronic evidence laws or regulations, low rank of existing internet control regulations and technological impediments altogether limit the efficiency of Chinese governments' law enforcement.

In the episode, Leslie is disappointed when Ben rejects her romantic advances, and is surprised when she is matched with Tom in an online dating service. Meanwhile, Ron and Chris have a cook-off to determine which is better: red or lean meat. The episode was written by Alan Yang and directed by Ken Whittingham. After it aired, NBC launched a website for HoosierMate.com, the fictional online dating site featured in \\"Soulmates\\". The episode featured a guest appearance by stand-up comedian Kirk Fox as sewage department employee Joe, who previously appeared in the second season. Josh Pence, who appeared with Parks co-star Rashida Jones in the 2010 film The Social Network, also appeared in \\"Soulmates\\" as a man wearing cowboy clothes who dates Ann. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 4.89 million household viewers, a slight decrease from the previous original episode, \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\". It received generally positive reviews, with several commentators particularly praising the performance of Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford. Plot Chris (Rob Lowe) enacts a government-wide health initiative in Pawnee, starting by banning red meat from the city hall commissary, much to the displeasure of Ron (Nick Offerman). He challenges Chris to a burger cook-off to prove red meat is superior to Chris' preferred lean meat, with red meat staying on the menu if Ron wins. Meanwhile, Leslie (Amy Poehler) invites Ben (Adam Scott) out to dinner, but he turns her down, leaving Leslie confused because she was sure Ben was attracted to her. Ann (Rashida Jones), who is now dating multiple men after taking Donna's (Retta) advice to be more adventurous, tells Leslie to join an online dating website called HoosierMate.com and helps set up her profile (after Leslie's original description of herself was \\"yellow haired female; likes waffles and news\\"). Leslie finds a match that is 98 percent compatible with her - a \\"soulmate\\" rating - but is horrified to discover that it is Tom (Aziz Ansari). Additionally, the crude sewage department employee Joe (Kirk Fox) makes a romantic advance toward Leslie, prompting her to launch a \\"douche-vestigation\\" to find out why she attracts the wrong type of man. Meanwhile, Chris takes Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza), and Ron to a health food market called Grain 'n Simple, where he gathers numerous ingredients for the perfect turkey burger, but Ron is unfazed, simply buying a pound of red meat from his favorite food market, Food and Stuff. In her investigation, Leslie quickly learns Joe merely hits on any woman as long as she is not elderly. She takes Tom out to lunch to learn more about him. He responds to all of Leslie's questions with his usual chauvinistic answers, annoying her to the point that she admits she took him out because they matched on HoosierMate. A delighted Tom teases Leslie the rest of the day by pretending they are a couple, but she finally silences him by kissing him. Chris notices the kiss and warns Leslie that he has a strict policy against workplace dating. At the cook-off, Chris prepares his meticulous turkey burgers for the judges: Tom, Donna, Jerry (Jim O'Heir), and Kyle (Andy Forrest). They all love it, but give much higher praise to Ron's simple hamburger on a bun. Initially surprised, even Chris comes to admit the burger is superior after trying it, so he agrees to reinstate red meat on the commissary menu. Chris later tells Leslie his dating policy has affected others, explaining that he earlier warned Ben not to ask out a co-worker. Leslie realizes that is why Ben rejected her and is glad when Ben asks her to eat in front of her favorite city hall mural. Leslie deletes her profile on HoosierMate, and is relieved to learn that Tom has 26 different profiles on the site to match himself with any type of woman, although the one Leslie matched with was his \\"nerd\\" profile. Production Stand-up comedian Kirk Fox made a guest appearance in \\"Soulmates\\". \\"Soulmates\\" was written by Alan Yang and directed by Ken Whittingham. The idea of Chris' no-dating policy stemmed from real life policies in small town governments. Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur said although romantic obstacles between two characters are difficult to make effective and genuine, he believed the policy was realistic and fitting with the type of show. Schur said: \\"The 'no dating' thing is a very big deal in government ‚Äì these people are handling taxpayer money, so relationships are even more frowned upon than they are in the private sector.\\" The episode features a fictional online dating service called HoosierMate.com, inspired by the nickname Hoosier for residents of Indiana, where Parks and Recreation is set. After the episode aired, NBC started a fake website on an actual HoosierMate.com domain, which included fake accounts for Leslie and Tom similar to those featured in \\"Soulmates\\". Stand-up comedian Kirk Fox made a guest appearance in \\"Soulmates\\" as Pawnee sewer department employee Joe, who he previously played in the second season episodes \\"The Camel\\" and \\"Telethon\\". Josh Pence, who appeared with Parks co- star Rashida Jones in the 2010 film The Social Network, also appeared in \\"Soulmates\\" as a man wearing cowboy clothes who dates Ann. During one scene in \\"Soulmates\\", Ron misunderstood a turkey burger to be \\"a fried turkey leg inside a grilled hamburger\\". After the episode aired, the cooking website Eater.com created and posted a recipe for that exact food. Cultural references When Leslie asks Tom what he would ask for if given three wishes, one of them is to star in a remake of the 1991 action film Point Break playing the roles of both main characters, who are played by Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze. During one scene, while on hold during a telephone call, Tom sings badly out of tune to the hold music of \\"Forever Young\\", by the German synthpop group Alphaville. At one point, Tom describes the nicknames he has for various foods, and describes sandwiches as \\"sammies, sandoozles or Adam Sandlers\\", the latter of which refers to the comedian and actor Adam Sandler. Andy tells Chris his favorite food is Skittles sandwiched between two Starburst, which he calls \\"Andy's Mouth Surprise\\". When Leslie describes her ideal date as a dark and mysterious man who can play the organ, Ann says she believes Leslie is describing the title character from The Phantom of the Opera, a story about a deformed man who haunts an opera hall. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Soulmates\\" was seen by an estimated 4.89 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, with a 2.9 rating/5 share among all viewers and a 2.4 rating/6 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. The \\"Soulmates\\" rating constituted a slight decrease from the previous episode, \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\", which was seen by 5.16 million households. In its 9:30 p.m. timeslot, \\"Soulmates\\" was outperformed by the Fox crime drama series Bones, which was seen by 10.96 million household viewers, and the CBS forensic crime series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which was seen by 8.47 million households. It outperformed a repeat of the ABC medical drama series Grey's Anatomy, which was seen by 3.86 million household viewers, and an original episode of the CW Television Network drama series Nikita, which was seen by 2.013 million households. =Reviews= \\"Soulmates\\" received generally positive reviews, with several commentators particularly praising the performance of Aziz Ansari. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said Ansari \\"has somehow found a way to make Tom petulant, sexist, and materialistic without ever being unlikable\\". Meslow also complimented the \\"slight but charming\\" subplot about the burger cook-off, and said Rob Lowe stood his own against the show's reliable comedic stars Nick Offerman and Chris Pratt. Zap2it writer Rick Porter called \\"Soulmates\\" one of the \\"out-and-out funniest episodes of the season\\" and provided Ansari with the \\"best sustained bit of comedy he's had in a long time\\". Porter also said he appreciated how the script \\"wisely didn't make much\\" over Ann's dating many men, claiming the subtlety of the joke was effective. Andy Daglas of ChicagoNow also said Ansari \\"stole the show\\" and that \\"Soulmates\\" was an excellent showcase for his character, who had largely remained on the sidelines throughout the season. Daglas said the scenes with Tom mocking Leslie were effective not only due to Ansari's performance, but also because of the genuine loyalty and admiration that had been built between the two characters. The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler called \\"Soulmates\\" one of the best Parks and Recreation episodes, and praised it for advancing its character relationships and finding \\"tons of natural, free-flowing comedy in something incredibly mundane\\", such as a conflict over burgers. Matt Fowler of IGN said he enjoyed seeing Offerman and Lowe pitted against each other, which he described as an \\"epic\\" pairing. Fowler also said he enjoyed that the script introduced \\"mini-mysteries\\" that took some time to reveal, like why Ben seemed uncomfortable around Leslie, and why Leslie and Tom were a match on the dating website. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic said he is enjoying the slow and deliberate pace at which the Leslie and Ben relationship is progressing. He also said Ansari \\"delivered just the right amount to creep out Leslie (and) keep me in fits of laughter\\", and said Tom's slang nicknames for food were \\"some of the funniest Tom-isms he's doled out yet\\". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell said the episode demonstrates how, even several months after the addition of Lowe and Adam Scott to the cast, their presence allows for excellent new story opportunities, like the Ron and Chris cook-off and Ben's infatuation with Leslie. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said \\"Soulmates\\" demonstrates how Parks and Recreation is superior to other comedy shows because it \\"invests in its characters and really allows the audience time to get to know them\\" rather than depending solely on gags. Alan Sepinwall said he \\"laughed louder and more frequently at it than any episode so far this season\\" except for \\"Flu Season\\" and called the Ron and Chris subplot as \\"predictable as hell but perfectly-executed\\". Sepinwall objected to the introduction of a no-dating policy simply to slow the budding romance between Leslie and Ben, and said \\"so much of this season has been so perfect that the rare imperfections stand out even more than they would on a weaker overall comedy\\". Joel Keller of TV Squad said the no-dating policy felt like a plot contrivance meant strictly to keep Ben and Leslie apart, which he felt was not good for the story. However, he complimented Leslie and Tom's scenes together, and said the subplot was even funnier, which he called a \\"Ron Swanson classic\\". Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said the episode was \\"a little too disjointed for me\\", particularly because the two plots were barely associated with each other. However, she said the show included funny individual jokes, and enjoyed the moment when Leslie kissed Tom.

It is the latest entry in the Stoked Rider snowboard game series and is in association with Absinthe Films. In 2009 an updated version, Stoked: Big Air Edition, was released for Xbox 360, and a Microsoft Windows version was released only for the PAL region in 2011. It is the first game in the series to feature multiple mountains and real life sponsors, and also the first to be released on a console. It also has a real weather experience; for example, when it snows, powder builds up on the mountain. When it does not snow, rocks are exposed. Gameplay Stoked features an adaptive system where the game recognizes \\"stylish\\" riding versus \\"hucker\\" riding; this affects the player's score if they are known for riding in one way. The original game features five different open mountains including Almirante Nieto, Mount Fuji, Diablerets, Mount Shuksan, and Alaska. Originally the mountains are only ventured through set waypoints of a helicopter, but upon achieving a score of 50,000 points on every run of a mountain, the player will gain the helicopter license for that particular mountain, allowing them to designate their own drop points. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot noted \\"occasional unpredictable physics\\" but that Stoked was a \\"blast, and considering that this wealth of content is going for a bargain price, it's an easy choice for boarders looking for a virtual outlet for their shredding fantasies.\\" IGN said that \\"touches like snazzy weather effects, cool challenges online and (eventually) in single-player [would] please the diehard boarders out there.\\" It was asserted that \\"After Shaun White Snowboarding was released to a lukewarm critical reception late last year, it looked like fans of the genre were in line for a disappointing winter\\" however, although \\"Stoked wasn't a game that was on a whole lot of people's radars...the finished product garnered quite a bit of critical acclaim for shirking the unnecessary glitz of \\"extreme\\" sports games and focusing on the basics of snowboarding.\\" In Japan, where the game was ported for release and published by Russel on January 28, 2010, Famitsu gave it a score of one six, two sevens, and one six for a total of 26 out of 40. Big Air Edition After the success of the original Stoked and the release of the game in European markets, Bongfish released an expanded version of the title called Stoked: Big Air Edition. Big Air Edition adds two new mountains, Laax and K2, to the original roster of five as well as including an upgraded frame rate and enhanced snow particles. The game also includes marked paths down the mountain and brand new racing events that will pit riders against each other, in addition to groomed terrain park area. It was also announced that brand new 2010 gear and clothing would be included from major brands. The PAL version and Microsoft Windows release also include bonus video features from Absinthe Films. =Reception= The Xbox 360 version received \\"average\\" reviews, albeit a bit more positive than the original Stoked, according to Metacritic. In Japan, where the same console version was also ported for release and published by Russel on January 13, 2011, Famitsu also gave it a score of 26 out of 40.

They are the only foam- nesting tree frogs in the Old World Tree frog family, Rhacophoridae. Genus Taruga was previously assigned to the genus Polypedates. As presently understood, Taruga comprises three named species: T. fastigo, T. eques and T. longinasus. Hence two genera of foam-nesting rhacophorid tree frogs are present in Sri Lanka: (1) Polypedates, with many species in India and Asia but just two in Sri Lanka (P. maculatus‚Äî widely distributed in South Asia; and P. cruciger‚Äî endemic to Sri Lanka, albeit widely distributed); and (2) Taruga, the Sri Lankan endemic forms, whose three constituent species (T. eques, T. fastigo and T. longinasus) each have restricted distributions mostly in the forested highlands. The best character to distinguish the adults of Taruga from Polypedates are a set of prominent cone-like projections around the vent. Furthermore, the supratympanic fold of Taruga is straighter than those in Polypedates. The snout of Taruga is very much acute than that of Polypedates. Considering tadpoles, the vent of Polypedates forms a tube between left leg and tail, and in Taruga, there is no such tube, only an opening between leg and tail. There are also several more features of the mouth cavity, such as the number of projections on the tongue, shape of the tongue etc. that helps to distinguish Taruga from Polypedates. Taruga in Sanskrit (and early-Sinhala) means \\"tree climber\\". This name is very appropriate as the adults of these are tree inhabiting frogs, and rarely come to the ground. They often even lay their eggs on vegetation overhanging water. All three frogs need shade in the form of a canopy to survive, and shallow and slow flowing streams or puddles to breed. The female of the species builds a foamy nest overhanging water where eggs develop for a few days, after which tadpoles fall into water where they undergo further development until metamorphosis occurs. The juvenile frogs that emerge from water return to an arboreal life, on trees. Sri Lanka is now known to contain clade level endemicity despite many land-bridge connections with India. Taruga is yet another such deeply divergent clade.

Cholesterol dependent cytolysins are a family of Œ≤-barrel pore-forming exotoxins that are secreted by gram-positive bacteria. CDCs are secreted as water-soluble monomers of 50-70 kDa, that when bound to the target cell, form a circular homo-oligomeric complex containing as many as 40 (or more) monomers. Through multiple conformational changes, the Œ≤-barrel transmembrane structure (~250 √Ö in diameter depending on the toxin) is formed and inserted into the target cell membrane. The presence of cholesterol in the target membrane is required for pore formation, though the presence of cholesterol is not required by all CDCs for binding. For example, Intermedilysin (ILY; TC# 1.C.12.1.5) secreted by Streptococcus intermedius will bind only to target membranes containing a specific protein receptor, independent of the presence of cholesterol, but cholesterol is required by intermedilysin (ILY; TC# 1.C.12.1.5) for pore formation. While the lipid environment of cholesterol in the membrane can affect toxin binding, the exact molecular mechanism that cholesterol regulates the cytolytic activity of the CDC is not fully understood. Cyto-lethal effects Once the pore is formed within the target cell membrane, the regulation of the intracellular environment and what enters and leaves the cell is lost. The pore being ~250 √Ö in diameter is large enough to allow the loss of amino acids, nucleotides, small and large proteins, as well as ions (Ca2+,Na+, K+, etc.). The loss of calcium in particular, which is involved in multiple molecular pathways, will have a large impact on cell survival. The pore will also lead to an influx of water, which may lead to blebbing and cell death. =Purpose= Bacteria invest energy into creating these toxins because they act as virulence factors. By targeting immune cells such as macrophages the bacteria will be protected against phagocytosis and destruction by respiratory burst.  Structure  At the level of the primary structure, cholesterol dependent cytolysins (CDCs) display a high degree of sequence similarity ranging from 40% to 80%. This is mainly reflected in the conserved core of about 471 amino acids shared by all CDCs, which essentially corresponds to the sequence of pneumolysin, the shortest member of the family. CDCs with longer sequences usually display variations in the N-terminus, the functions of which are unknown for many members but for some are believed to serve various functions unrelated to secretion. For instance, Listeriolysin O (LLO; TC# 1.C.12.1.7) from Listeria monocytogenes exhibits a proline rich sequence at its amino terminus that plays a role in the stability of LLO. The extreme case is lectinolysin (LLY; UniProt: B3UZR3) from some strains of Streptococcus mitis and S. pseudopneumoniae contain a functional fucose-binding lectin at the amino terminus. Furthermore, all CDCs contain a highly conserved undecapeptide, which is thought to be critical for cholesterol-mediated membrane recognition. The CDC monomer consist of 4 structural domains, with domain 4 (D4) being involved with membrane binding. Multiple CDC monomers will oligomerize once bound to the target cell membrane forming a Œ≤-barrel structure which will be inserted into the target cell membrane. The core section of amino acids, which are required for pore formation, are more conserved between CDCs, which is illustrated by similar three-dimensional structures and pore-forming mechanisms. The structurally conserved domain 4 of CDC contains four conserve loops L1-L3 and an undecapeptide region, which is believed to be involved in cholesterol dependent recognition. Single amino acid modifications in these loops prevented Perfingolysin O (PFO; TC# 1.C.12.1.1), which is a CDC secreted by Clostridium perfringens from binding to cholesterol rich liposomes. More recently, Farrand et al. has shown that two amino acids, a threonine-leucine pair in loop L1, comprise the cholesterol binding motif and is conserved in all known CDCs. Some CDC protein crystal structures available in RCSB include: Domain 4 of Perfringolysin O with labeled loops L1, L2, L3, and Undecapeptide region. Prepore and pore assembly The mechanism of pore formation of perfingolysin O (PFO; TC# 1.C.12.1.1), which is secreted by Clostridium perfringens, begins with encountering and binding to cholesterol on the target membrane. The C-terminus of PFO domain 4 (D4) encounters the membrane first. The binding of D4 triggers a structural rearrangement in which the PFO monomers oligomerize forming the pre-pore complex.EM reconstruction of Perfringolysin O pre-pore(A) and pore(B) structure. The binding of CDC to the target membrane is required for oligmerization. The oligomerization of the CDC requires the conversion of alpha-helical regions to amphipathic beta-strands that is initiated by protein-lipid interactions or protein-protein interactions. The water-soluble form of the toxins is prevented from oligomerizing by having the access of one edge of a core Œ≤-sheet in the monomer blocked. To be specific, Œ≤5, a short polypeptide loop, hydrogen-bonds to Œ≤4, preventing Œ≤4 interaction with Œ≤1 on the adjacent monomer. The binding of D4 to the membrane surface triggers a conformational change in domain 3, which rotates Œ≤5 away from Œ≤4, exposing Œ≤4 allowing it to interact with the Œ≤1 strand of another PFO molecule, initiating oligomerization. Water-soluble monomeric form of perfingolysin O (PFO) domain 3 showing Œ≤5 loop bound to Œ≤4 preventing premature oligomerization. Unlike most of the exposed surface residues of CDC that are not conserved the residues at the surface of the D4 tip, which are involved in membrane interactions, are highly conserved. Pore formation begins once two amphipathic transmembrane Œ≤-hairpins from ~35 PFO monomers are inserted in a concerted fashion, which then create a large Œ≤-barrel that perforates the membrane. The toxin gets around the energy barrier, of inserting the CDC into the membrane, by the formation of the Œ≤-barrel, which will lower the energy requirements compared to what would be required for the insertion of single Œ≤-hairpins. In the water-soluble monomeric form of CDC, the transmembrane Œ≤-hairpins that are located on both sides of the central Œ≤-sheet on domain 3 are each folded as three short Œ±-helices to minimize the exposure of hydrophobic residues. The Œ±-helices are inserted into the target cell membrane bilayer and a conformational change takes place into amphipathic Œ≤-hairpins. A concerted mechanism of insertion is required so that the hydrophilic surfaces of the Œ≤-hairpins remain exposed to the aqueous medium, and not the hydrophobic membrane core.

Six short Œ±-helices in D3 unfold to form two transmembrane Œ≤-hairpin (TMH), TMH1 (red) and TMH2 (green). Ribbon structure of monomeric Perfringolysin O (PFO) domain 3, representing the transition of TMH1 (red) and TMH2 (green) from Œ±-helices to Œ≤-sheet. Specificity The binding of CDC to its target membrane requires the recognition of cholesterol or in the case of intermedilysin (ILY; TC# 1.C.12.1.5), the recognition of CD59 membrane-anchored protein. The recognition of cholesterol provides specificity for eukaryotic cells and the specificity for the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein CD59 provides specificity for human cells. Even though cholesterol is not required for intermedilysin (ILY) to bind to a target cell, the presence of cholesterol is required for pore formation by all CDC. CDC are sensitive to both oxygen and cholesterol. Toxins isolated-form culture supernatants were inactivated once exposed to oxygen after being pre-incubated with cholesterol. CDC are also pH-sensitive. A change of pH in a medium from 7.4 to 6.0 caused a conformational change in perfringolysin O, leading to an alteration in the minimum cholesterol threshold required for binding. Another CDC, listeriolysin O (LLO), which functions at an acidic pH, will lose its function at a neutral pH at temperatures above 30 ¬∞C, which trigger the irreversible loss of activity by the unfolding of domain 3 in the soluble monomer. Role of cholesterol The presence of cholesterol in the membrane of the target cell is required for CDC pore formation. The arrangement of cholesterol molecules in the bilayer may also be important for successful binding. The non-polar hydrocarbon tail of cholesterol orients itself toward the polar center of the membrane lipid bilayer, while the 3-Œ≤-OH group is oriented closer to the ester bonds formed by the fatty acid chains, and glycerol backbones closer to the membrane surface. Even with the 3-Œ≤-OH group near the membrane surface, it is not very exposed compared to the phospholipid head groups. The availability of cholesterol at the membrane surface is dependent upon its interaction with other membrane components such as phospholipids and proteins; and the more cholesterol interacts with these components the less available it is to interact with extramembranous molecules. Some factors that affect cholesterols availability are size of the polar head groups and the ability of the phospholipid to hydrogen bond with the 3-Œ≤-OH group of cholesterol. Cholesterol associates with phospholipids, forming a stoichiometric complex and contributes to membrane fluidity. If cholesterol concentration exceeds a certain point, free cholesterol will begin to precipitate out of the membrane. The binding and pore formation of CDC will occur when the concentration of cholesterol exceeds the association capacity of the phospholipids, allowing the excess cholesterol to associate with the toxin. The presence of cholesterol aggregates in an aqueous solution were sufficient to initiate a conformation change and oligomerization of perfringolysin O (PFO), while no changes were seen by perfingolysin O with epicholesterol aggregates in solution. Epicholesterol is a sterol that differs from cholesterol by the orientation of the 3-Œ≤-OH group, which is axial in epicholesterol and equatorial in cholesterol. Since the orientation of the hydroxyl group has such an effect on the bind/pore-formation of CDC, the equatorial conformation may be required for docking of the sterol to the binding pocket in domain 4, or to be properly exposed at the surface of lipid structures. The conserved undecapeptide (Tryptophan-rich motif) of the CDCs The conserved undecapeptide motif (ECTGLAWEWWR) in domain 4 of the CDCs si the signature motif of the CDCs and was originally thought to be the cholesterol binding motif, but that was shown to be incorrect in a number of studies and now, as described above, Farrand et al. showed that the cholesterol binding motif is a threonine-leucine pair in loop 1 at the base of domain 4. It has since been shown that the conserved undecapeptide is a key element in the allosteric pathway that couples membrane binding to the initiation of structural changes in domain 3 of the CDC monomer that allows it to begin the process of oligomerization into the prepore complex. Effects of other membrane lipids The phospholipid composition of a cell membrane affects the arrangement of cholesterol within the membrane and the ability for CDC to bind and initiate pore-formation. For example, perfringolysin O will preferentially bind to cholesterol-rich membranes composed mainly of phospholipids containing 18-carbon acyl chains. Lipids having a conical molecular shape alter the energetic state of membrane cholesterol, augmenting the interaction of the sterol with the cholesterol-specific cytolysin. Since high cholesterol concentrations are required for CDC binding/pore-formation, it was thought that CDC would associate with lipid rafts. A later study showed that sphingomyelin, a necessary component of lipid raft formation, inhibited rather than promoted the binding of perfringolysin O to the target membrane. Possible Coordination With Other Toxins It is possible that the exposure of cholesterol at the membrane surface might be facilitated by other membrane- damaging toxins secreted such as phospholipase C, which cleave the head groups of phospholipids increasing the exposure of cholesterol. Two organisms, Clostridium perfringens that produces perfringolysin O (CDC) and Œ±-toxin during clostridial myonecrosis and Listeria monocytogenes which releases listeriolysin O (CDC) and phospholipases C leading to the virulence of these bacteria. However, although the C. perfringens Œ±-toxin treatment of liposome membranes increase the activity of PFO on those membranes this affect does not appear to aways be the case \\"in vivo\\". During C. perfringens gas gangrene (myonecrosis) the main site of action of the C. perfringens Œ±-toxin is the muscle tissue, where the cleavage of the phospholipid head groups does not seem to increase the activity of perfringolysin O on this tissue, as knockouts of PFO do not appear to significantly alter the course of the myonecrosis. Therefore, cleavage of the headgroups in the muscle tissue by Œ±-toxin does not appear to result in a significant increase in PFO activity on this tissue.

In July 2010, around 200 hectares of the area were damaged or destroyed in a wildfire that took over a week to put out.Trouw.nl:Verwoestende brand Strabrechtse Heide Location and surroundings In the northwest, the Strabrechtse Heide passes into the Braakhuizense Heide, which is owned by the foundation Brabants Landschap. Near Heeze, the healthlands and fields pass into the Herbertusbossen (also owned by Brabants Landschap) and the grounds of Heeze Castle. The area partially falls under the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive of the European Union. In 2006, the Strabrechtse Heide, along with a part of the valley of the Kleine Dommel stream, was assigned as Natura 2000 area under the Natura 2000 area name \\"Strabrechtse Heide & Beuven\\".BirdLife International (2012), Important Bird Areas factsheet: Strabrechtse Heide and Beuven . Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 03/07/2012 The eastern part of the area that lies in the municipality of Someren was originally called Lieropsche Heide, after the village of Lierop. In the nineteenth century, both it and the Strabrechtse Heide proper were part of a larger heathland area between the valleys of the Kleine Dommel and the Aa rivers. Towards the north, the heath extended to Nuenen (there called Molenheide, Collsche Heide and Refelingse Heide). To the south of the road between Heeze and Someren, the Somerensche Heide extended to the Weerterbosch and Groote Peel areas. Around the beginning of the twentieth century, most of the heaths to the north of the Strabrechtse Heide were converted into forest or agricultural land. The construction of the A67 motorway separated the Strabrechtse Heide from the forest area between Geldrop and Mierlo. Plans to construct the A2 motorway to the east of Eindhoven, which would separate the heath from the valley of the Kleine Dommel, were not carried out. Common Heather and Common Juniper are found in the dry areas, and the more marshy wetlands are home to Erica, Purple Moor Grass, Bog Myrtle and Marsh Gentian. The spread of grass across the area is countered by allowing a flock of sheep to graze, by mowing and sod cutting. The heath area is surrounded by forests. The transition area towards the valley of the Kleine Dommel has several unusual forms of plant life and is also important for many animal species. Fire The July 2010 fire On 2 July 2010, a wildfire started in the northern part of the Strabrechtse Heide, after several weeks of hot and dry summer weather. The fire was initially fought by hundreds of firefighters, assisted by 100 more from the Dutch Military. Because of the fire, the A67 motorway had to be closed off for a short period. The roadway was at one point completely covered in smoke and the flames were even able to reach across to the median and then to other side of the road, igniting the dry grass there too in a few places. The fire took several days to master, and over a week to put out completely, and destroyed about 200 hectares of forest and heathland, over ten percent of the total area.

The fighting turned Wazzin into something of a ghost town, valuable only as a strategic location. Background In the early days of the war, towns in the Nafusa Mountains quickly joined the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, but soon came under heavy attack by loyalist forces. Wazzin was initially taken by rebels, but soon fell under the control of loyalists, cutting off this supply line to the rebel-held mountain towns. To relieve the military and humanitarian pressure on their besieged towns, the rebels fought to retake the crossing. Battle On 21 April, rebel forces assaulted Wazzin but were met with fierce resistance by loyalist soldiers. Their advances were initially slow but eventually they overwhelmed Gaddafi's men, taking the town of Wazzin before swiftly capturing the crossing itself, causing Gaddafi's men to be trapped in between the Tunisian border and the advancing rebels. In the end, 105 loyalist soldiers retreated into Tunisia where they surrendered to Tunisian officials. All of Gaddafi's men returned to Libya without charge, however 13 men captured by the rebels remained in their hands. With the border post in rebel hands, they began bringing supplies from Tunisia into the besieged towns of the Nafusa Mountains. On 24 April, loyalist forces began shelling the border post in an attempt to recapture it, though no casualties were reported. On 28 April, loyalist forces re-captured the Wazzin border crossing with Tunisia after a swift advance in which they pushed the rebels back over the border into Tunisia where the fighting continued on the edge of the Tunisian border town of Dehiba.Libya Live Blog - April 28 State TV stated that several rebels were killed and others captured in the attack on the border post. Later during the day, the rebels attempted a counter-attack. Initially, they claimed having re- taken the post. However, Reuters denied it later by confirming that the loyalists were still in full control. During the confusion, when it was thought that the rebels had won, scores of civilian vehicles attempted to re- enter Libya from Tunisia. But, they quickly turned back when they found Gaddafi's forces were still at the border crossing. Heavy fighting continued into the night, with rebels apparently massing for a renewed attack against the better-armed loyalistsAJE Libya Live Blog ‚ÄìApril 28, 11:14PM and during the evening the rebels once again claimed to had re-taken the crossing after they received reinforcements from Zintan. Still, this claim was also later found to be untrue.Rebels Register Small Gains in Western Libya The next morning, loyalist troops advanced from the crossing post of Wazzin in pursuit of the rebels, who had retreated onto Tunisian soil after a night of fighting, over the border and engaged them in the center of the town of Dehiba. Soon after that clashes between Gaddafi and Tunisian troops were reported. The Tunisian military soon seized loyalist troops and led them back over the border. At the same time, the rebels again claimed to have re-taken the border post. However, Al Jazeera confirmed that the Gaddafi green flag of Libya was still flying over the border post thus proving that government troops were still in control.Libya Live Blog - April 29 12:20PM Control of the post shifted back and forth in the following days. =Libyan Army enters Tunisia= By 29 April, the situation on the border with Tunisia began deteriorating rapidly. Rebel forces were frequently using the border region as a way to evade capture by Gaddafi forces, as well as a principal resupply route. In response, the loyalist forces launched an artillery barrage on the Tunisian town of Dehiba, and advanced across the border. Elements of the Tunisian Army and border police, who had only recently returned to their posts following the border violation on 28 April responded with deadly force to the incursion. By mid-afternoon, press reports came in stating that the Tunisian military was engaged in combat with the Libyan Army in central Dehiba. Later in the day fights between pro-Gaddafi forces and Tunisian army had ceased. The Tunisian military had captured and disarmed pro-Gaddafi soldiers and then sent them back to Libya. As of 1 May, Gaddafi's forces were still shelling Tunisian territory, although no further casualties were reported. On 7 May, renewed fighting in Wazzin lead to more shells falling in Tunisian territory, sparking mass evacuations in the border town of Dehiba. Roughly 100 shells fell in Tunisian territory causing one house to be damaged yet nobody was killed. The Tunisian authorities stated that the situation was 'very dangerous' and that they would do everything they had to in order to protect their country. Nine days later, on 16 May, Tunisian troops stopped 200 loyalist soldiers in 4√ó4s crossing into Tunisia to try to outflank the rebels. The soldiers cooperated and there was no confrontation. On July 9, there were sketchy reports that Gaddafi's men were still attacking Wazzin and of a large loyalist army amassing nearby, possibly with the intention of retaking the crossing. On 29 July, rebels attacked loyalists in nearby Ayn Ghazaya. Heavy fighting ensued, and rebels shut down the crossing until it was more secure.

In graph algorithms, the widest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two designated vertices in a weighted graph, maximizing the weight of the minimum-weight edge in the path. The widest path problem is also known as the bottleneck shortest path problem or the maximum capacity path problem. It is possible to adapt most shortest path algorithms to compute widest paths, by modifying them to use the bottleneck distance instead of path length. However, in many cases even faster algorithms are possible. For instance, in a graph that represents connections between routers in the Internet, where the weight of an edge represents the bandwidth of a connection between two routers, the widest path problem is the problem of finding an end-to-end path between two Internet nodes that has the maximum possible bandwidth.; The smallest edge weight on this path is known as the capacity or bandwidth of the path. As well as its applications in network routing, the widest path problem is also an important component of the Schulze method for deciding the winner of a multiway election, and has been applied to digital compositing, metabolic pathway analysis, and the computation of maximum flows. A closely related problem, the minimax path problem, asks for the path that minimizes the maximum weight of any of its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation. Undirected graphs In an undirected graph, a widest path may be found as the path between the two vertices in the maximum spanning tree of the graph, and a minimax path may be found as the path between the two vertices in the minimum spanning tree. In any graph, directed or undirected, there is a straightforward algorithm for finding a widest path once the weight of its minimum-weight edge is known: simply delete all smaller edges and search for any path among the remaining edges using breadth first search or depth first search. Based on this test, there also exists a linear time algorithm for finding a widest path in an undirected graph, that does not use the maximum spanning tree. The main idea of the algorithm is to apply the linear-time path-finding algorithm to the median edge weight in the graph, and then either to delete all smaller edges or contract all larger edges according to whether a path does or does not exist, and recurse in the resulting smaller graph. use undirected bottleneck shortest paths in order to form composite aerial photographs that combine multiple images of overlapping areas. In the subproblem to which the widest path problem applies, two images have already been transformed into a common coordinate system; the remaining task is to select a seam, a curve that passes through the region of overlap and divides one of the two images from the other. Pixels on one side of the seam will be copied from one of the images, and pixels on the other side of the seam will be copied from the other image. Unlike other compositing methods that average pixels from both images, this produces a valid photographic image of every part of the region being photographed. They weight the edges of a grid graph by a numeric estimate of how visually apparent a seam across that edge would be, and find a bottleneck shortest path for these weights. Using this path as the seam, rather than a more conventional shortest path, causes their system to find a seam that is difficult to discern at all of its points, rather than allowing it to trade off greater visibility in one part of the image for lesser visibility elsewhere. A solution to the minimax path problem between the two opposite corners of a grid graph can be used to find the weak Fr√©chet distance between two polygonal chains. Here, each grid graph vertex represents a pair of line segments, one from each chain, and the weight of an edge represents the Fr√©chet distance needed to pass from one pair of segments to another.. If all edge weights of an undirected graph are positive, then the minimax distances between pairs of points (the maximum edge weights of minimax paths) form an ultrametric; conversely every finite ultrametric space comes from minimax distances in this way. A data structure constructed from the minimum spanning tree allows the minimax distance between any pair of vertices to be queried in constant time per query, using lowest common ancestor queries in a Cartesian tree. The root of the Cartesian tree represents the heaviest minimum spanning tree edge, and the children of the root are Cartesian trees recursively constructed from the subtrees of the minimum spanning tree formed by removing the heaviest edge. The leaves of the Cartesian tree represent the vertices of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two vertices equals the weight of the Cartesian tree node that is their lowest common ancestor. Once the minimum spanning tree edges have been sorted, this Cartesian tree can be constructed in linear time. Directed graphs In directed graphs, the maximum spanning tree solution cannot be used. Instead, several different algorithms are known; the choice of which algorithm to use depends on whether a start or destination vertex for the path is fixed, or whether paths for many start or destination vertices must be found simultaneously. =All pairs= The all-pairs widest path problem has applications in the Schulze method for choosing a winner in multiway elections in which voters rank the candidates in preference order. The Schulze method constructs a complete directed graph in which the vertices represent the candidates and every two vertices are connected by an edge. Each edge is directed from the winner to the loser of a pairwise contest between the two candidates it connects, and is labeled with the margin of victory of that contest. Then the method computes widest paths between all pairs of vertices, and the winner is the candidate whose vertex has wider paths to each opponent than vice versa. The results of an election using this method are consistent with the Condorcet method ‚Äì a candidate who wins all pairwise contests automatically wins the whole election ‚Äì but it generally allows a winner to be selected, even in situations where the Concorcet method itself fails.More specifically, the only kind of tie that the Schulze method fails to break is between two candidates who have equally wide paths to each other. The Schulze method has been used by several organizations including the Wikimedia Foundation.See Jesse Plamondon-Willard, Board election to use preference voting, May 2008; Mark Ryan, 2008 Wikimedia Board Election results, June 2008; 2008 Board Elections, June 2008; and 2009 Board Elections, August 2009. To compute the widest path widths for all pairs of nodes in a dense directed graph, such as the ones that arise in the voting application, the asymptotically fastest known approach takes time where œâ is the exponent for fast matrix multiplication. Using the best known algorithms for matrix multiplication, this time bound becomes .. For an earlier algorithm that also used fast matrix multiplication to speed up all pairs widest paths, see and Chapter 5 of Instead, the reference implementation for the Schulze method uses a modified version of the simpler Floyd‚ÄìWarshall algorithm, which takes time. For sparse graphs, it may be more efficient to repeatedly apply a single-source widest path algorithm. =Single source= If the edges are sorted by their weights, then a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm can compute the bottlenecks between a designated start vertex and every other vertex in the graph, in linear time. The key idea behind the speedup over a conventional version of Dijkstra's algorithm is that the sequence of bottleneck distances to each vertex, in the order that the vertices are considered by this algorithm, is a monotonic subsequence of the sorted sequence of edge weights; therefore, the priority queue of Dijkstra's algorithm can be implemented as a bucket queue: an array indexed by the numbers from 1 to (the number of edges in the graph), where array cell contains the vertices whose bottleneck distance is the weight of the edge with position in the sorted order. This method allows the widest path problem to be solved as quickly as sorting; for instance, if the edge weights are represented as integers, then the time bounds for integer sorting a list of integers would apply also to this problem. =Single source and single destination= suggest that service vehicles and emergency vehicles should use minimax paths when returning from a service call to their base. In this application, the time to return is less important than the response time if another service call occurs while the vehicle is in the process of returning. By using a minimax path, where the weight of an edge is the maximum travel time from a point on the edge to the farthest possible service call, one can plan a route that minimizes the maximum possible delay between receipt of a service call and arrival of a responding vehicle. use maximin paths to model the dominant reaction chains in metabolic networks; in their model, the weight of an edge is the free energy of the metabolic reaction represented by the edge. Another application of widest paths arises in the Ford‚ÄìFulkerson algorithm for the maximum flow problem. Repeatedly augmenting a flow along a maximum capacity path in the residual network of the flow leads to a small bound, , on the number of augmentations needed to find a maximum flow; here, the edge capacities are assumed to be integers that are at most . However, this analysis does not depend on finding a path that has the exact maximum of capacity; any path whose capacity is within a constant factor of the maximum suffices. Combining this approximation idea with the shortest path augmentation method of the Edmonds‚ÄìKarp algorithm leads to a maximum flow algorithm with running time . It is possible to find maximum-capacity paths and minimax paths with a single source and single destination very efficiently even in models of computation that allow only comparisons of the input graph's edge weights and not arithmetic on them. The algorithm maintains a set of edges that are known to contain the bottleneck edge of the optimal path; initially, is just the set of all edges of the graph. At each iteration of the algorithm, it splits into an ordered sequence of subsets of approximately equal size; the number of subsets in this partition is chosen in such a way that all of the split points between subsets can be found by repeated median- finding in time . The algorithm then reweights each edge of the graph by the index of the subset containing the edge, and uses the modified Dijkstra algorithm on the reweighted graph; based on the results of this computation, it can determine in linear time which of the subsets contains the bottleneck edge weight. It then replaces by the subset that it has determined to contain the bottleneck weight, and starts the next iteration with this new set . The number of subsets into which can be split increases exponentially with each step, so the number of iterations is proportional to the iterated logarithm function, , and the total time is . In a model of computation where each edge weight is a machine integer, the use of repeated bisection in this algorithm can be replaced by a list-splitting technique of , allowing to be split into smaller sets in a single step and leading to a linear overall time bound.. Euclidean point sets Gaussian prime numbers whose minimax path length is 2 or more. A variant of the minimax path problem has also been considered for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in the tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners. In number theory, the unsolved Gaussian moat problem asks whether or not minimax paths in the Gaussian prime numbers have bounded or unbounded minimax length. That is, does there exist a constant such that, for every pair of points and in the infinite Euclidean point set defined by the Gaussian primes, the minimax path in the Gaussian primes between and has minimax edge length at most ?.

It is known for the Milkymist system-on-chip (SoC) which is a commercialized system-on-chip designs with free HDL source code. M-Labs technologies have been reused in diverse applications. For example, NASA's Communication Navigation and Networking Reconfigurable Testbed (CoNNeCT) experiment uses the memory controller that was originally developed for the Milkymist One and published under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). The project was presented at several open source and hacker conferences such as the Chaos Communication Congress, FOSDEM, Libre Software Meeting, and Libre Graphics Meeting 2011.

Milkymist SoC  The Milkymist system-on-chip uses the LatticeMico32 (LM32) core as a general purpose processor. It is a RISC 32-bit big endian CPU with a memory management unit (MMU) developed later by M-Labs contributors. It is supported by the GCC compiler and can run RTEMS and ŒºClinux. There is also an experimental back-end for LLVM targeting this microprocessor. The LM32 microprocessor is assisted by a texture mapping unit and a programmable floating point VLIW coprocessor which are used by the Flickernoise video synthesis software. It is also surrounded by various peripheral cores to support every I/O device of the Milkymist One. The system-on-chip interconnect uses three bridged buses and mixes the Wishbone protocol with two custom protocols used for configuration registers and high performance DMA with the SDRAM. The architecture of the Milkymist system-on-chip is largely documented in the project founder's Master thesis report. Most components of the system- on-chip, except the LatticeMico32 core, were custom developed and placed under the GNU GPL license. The QEMU emulator can be used to run and debug Milkymist SoC binaries on another computer.  Milkymist One and Flickernoise  The Milkymist One video synthesizer and reconfigurable computer is the main product released by the project. It was manufactured by Qi Hardware, a start- up founded by former Openmoko employees.

Barnard. George Gardner Barnard (c. 1829 Poughkeepsie, Dutchess County, New York ‚Äì April 27, 1879 New York CityYale Obituary Record) was an American lawyer and politician from New York. He was one of only four people ever tried by the New York Court for the Trial of Impeachments. Life He was the son of Frederic Barnard and Margaret (Allen) Barnard. He graduated from Yale College in 1847. Then he studied law with his brother Joseph F. Barnard, who was later Presiding Justice of the 2nd District of the New York Supreme Court. George was admitted to the bar, and began practice in Poughkeepsie, but soon went to California and practiced law there. In 1856, he returned to the East, and practiced law in New York City in partnership with Joseph J. Chambers. In November 1857, Barnard was elected on the Tammany Hall ticket Recorder of New York City, and remained in office from 1858 until the end of 1860. He presided at the trial of \\"Dab\\" Cunningham for the murder of \\"Paudeen\\" McLaughlin. On June 29, 1859, Barnard married Frances Anderson, and they had six children. =Impeachment= In November 1860, Barnard was elected to an 8-year term on the Supreme Court (1st District), and re-elected in 1868. Barnard became involved in a series of railroad litigations, beginning with the Erie War, when in February 1868 ‚Äî on the petition of Att. Gen. Marshall B. Champlain ‚Äî he removed Daniel Drew as Director and Treasurer of the railroad, and appointed Cornelius Vanderbilt's son-in-law George A. Osgood as Receiver for $10,000,000 of new Erie Railroad stock. In November 1868, Barnard appointed Jay Gould as Receiver of the Erie Railroad, but a week later Judge Josiah Sutherland vacated Barnard's order, and appointed Judge Henry E. Davis as Receiver instead. In August 1869, during the struggle for the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad, Judge Rufus W. Peckham appointed Robert H. Pruyn as Receiver, but Barnard vacated Peckham's order, and appointed James Fisk instead. Eight suits and cross-suits followed, and an armed attempt by Fisk and Gould ‚Äî involving more than 1,000 men on both sides ‚Äî tried to seize the railroad by force, but Pruyn was confirmed as Receiver anyway. Barnard continued to favor Fisk and Gould in the railroad litigations, culminating in his seizing 16 suits from the New York City Superior Court and the New York City Court of Common Pleas, so he could try them himself in the Supreme Court. This was reversed later by the General Term (now called the Appellate Division), affirming that a case must be tried in the court where it was brought. In March 1872, Barnard was impeached by the New York State Assembly. The Impeachment Court (consisting of the Judges of the New York Court of Appeals and the New York State Senators) convened at Saratoga in July, Lt. Gov. Allen C. Beach presided. On August 19, 1872, Barnard was convicted unanimously, and was removed from office. The court also barred Barnard from ever holding public office in the State thereafter, with only two contrary votes (cast by Senators William Johnson and Jarvis Lord). Barnard died in 1879 from Bright's disease at his residence, 23 West Twenty-Third Street, in New York City, and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery.

Further researchers - Johnson and Heinz (1978) and Navon & Gopher (1979) - went further with Kahneman's study.Kellogg, Ronald T. (2016). pp. 79-83.' Shalom Fisch used Kahneman's capacity theory, just as others did for their research, to published a paper on children's understanding of educational content on television. It is a communication theory based on model which is used to explain and predict how children learn from educational television programming. It is formed by combining cognitive psychology and limited capacity of working memory. Working memory is explained as having limited resources available for processing external information and when demands exceed capabilities, then the material will not be attended to. The model attempts to explain how cognitive resources are allocated when individuals, particularly children, comprehend both the educational and the narrative content of an educational program. Capacity theory suggests that when educational content is tangential to the narrative content the two information sources compete with one another for limited resources in working memory. However, when the distance between educational content and narrative content is small, the process complement one another rather than compete for resources, therefore an individual is likely comprehend more.  Three basic components of the capacity model  The capacity model consists of three basic components. # Processing of narrative content # Processing of education content # Distance between narrative and educational content = Processing of narrative content = Capacity model implies that television viewers will construct their understanding of the narrative content by accessing prior knowledge and draw inferences on the new material based on previous exposure. Theory and empirical research has supported the notion that people are using working memory to process information needed to follow the story line or plot. Due to the audio/visual nature of television, individual program factors will influence how much demand is used. For example, a fast paced action sequence will require more working memory to follow the action than perhaps a slow dialogue between two characters. This is best understood by breaking it down to two types of characteristics, viewer characteristics and program characteristics.  Viewer characteristics  * Viewer's prior knowledge ‚Äì if an individual is familiar with the narrative content, such as knowing the characters or storyline, then cognitive demand will be low and more working memory will be made available. * Story schema ‚Äì ability to understand the basic components of a story and the hierarchy of events will help influence the amount of cognitive demand required. * Cognitive abilities ‚Äì individuals with higher intelligence and higher cognitive abilities will make more efficient use of cognitive resources when encoding the narrative. * Interest in the story - the viewer's interest in the story will affect how much attention is paid to the narrative and therefore will influence how resources are allocated.  Program characteristics  Developmental research in text comprehension has found that young children can use schemata to process stories only when they are structured simply and clearly state causal linkages cf. Meadowcroft & Reeves, 1989 * Complexity of the narrative - the number of events in the story and the connections among them will influence how much working memory is required. Studies have shown that children process stories only when they are simple in their construction and clearly show casual linkage. Long narratives with many complex chains will increase demands required for processing. * Structure of the Story - stories that are constructed in easily recognizable patterns, such as a beginning, middle, and end are easier to follow, thus reducing demand. * Explicit vs inferred information - whether or not the information is clearly presented or if it is less clear, thus requiring making inference about the narrative, will affect the amount of cognitive processing required. = Processing educational content = The processing of educational content has not received as much attention as processing of narrative content. Many of the guiding principles in this section were developed out of speculation and then verified through current studies. As with the narrative content, there are viewer and program characteristics that effect comprehension.  Viewer characteristics  * Prior knowledge of content - similar to the processing of narrative content, previous exposure to educational information can reduce the amount of working memory required to process the information in children. This has been shown to be true in adults. * Interest in content - viewers will be able to dedicate a greater pool of resources to information in they are interested in the content. This was suggested by testing children's comprehension of mathematical word problems. The study showed that comprehension was enhanced if the child was interested in the narrative context which the problem occurred in.  Program characteristics  * Clarity of presentation - the degree to which the information is clearly presented will decrease required resources for processing information. * Explicitness of content - whether or not the content is clearly identifiable as educational material or if it hidden beneath the narrative will affect amount of cognition. = Distance = Distance is the final component of this model. The idea of distance separates this model from other cognitive processing models such as Limited Capacity. Distance referrers to the degree to which the educational content is integrated into the narrative. This concept has been dubbed \\"content on the plotline\\" by the Children's Television Workshop. This is best described as the role the content has in the story of events. Distance is not binary, but is best described in length as small or large. * Small distance suggests that the narrative and educational content are related to one another and that the educational content is causally embedded into the plot. * Large distance suggests that educational content is not involved in the story line and does not assist in moving the story forward. It may only be featured at low levels in the story hierarchy. Understanding the effect distance has on processing will explain how certain content competes for attention. Large distances will require more resources due to the increase in competition, however resources are limited. The process used to encode, store, and retrieve narrative content is the same as educational content. When the narrative and educational content are intertwined, then it is said to be a small distance, thus reducing the amount of competition for limited resources. The parallel process responsible for comprehending narrative and educational content complement one another, thus increasing information retention.  This model predicts that educational content will be better attended to when the distance from the narrative is small and has been shown in previous studies.  Factors which influence processing of narrative and educational content  There are several factors that will influence the processing of narrative and educational content. * Cognitive maturity of the child - studies have shown that cognitive capabilities develop in children at different ages. * Prior exposure to the material - if the child has been exposed to the educational material before, cognitive demand will be lessened. * Complexity of formal features - as mentioned previously, television has the opportunity to provide several audio and video features. Studies have shown that features such as fast program pacing may decrease processing capabilities.  Governing principles  This theory is governed by several broad principles detailing the allocation of resources among the two content types. =Narrative dominance= This principle suggests that priority is given to comprehension of the narrative content over the educational content assuming all things are equal. This primarily occurs when the distance between the educational content and narrative content is large. Working memory will be devoted to narrative before educational content. This is largely due to the fact that people typically select television content for its entertainment value before its educational value. Secondly, narrative content is featured as the primary or ‚Äúsurface‚Äù contents, whereas educational content is secondary or ‚Äúdeep‚Äù content. = Relative availability of resources = Each individual will have various levels of resource ability. As with any type of content the individual is exposed to, there will always be a competition for resources. Several factors can increase or decrease the demands required for processing, such as pacing, graphics, audio, and other production features. When high demands are required for processing the narrative content of educational programming, then less resources will be available for educational content. This demand to process both sources can be reduced if the educational content and narrative content are closely related. = Voluntary allocation = Individuals will select media to achieve certain goals or objectives. As a result, an individual may choose to watch an educational program and consciously attempt to allocate more resources to the educational content rather than the narrative content. Studies have consistently shown that a viewer‚Äôs reason for watching can affect at which level the narrative is recalled and understood. Further research using this model has revealed that the same has been shown to occur with educational content. It should be understood that this model does not assume that the attention paid to the educational content will cause the viewer to abandon resources to the narrative.  Notes  Kellogg, R.

During the boom years the online poker player pool at least doubled in size every year. Causes The seeds of the boom began in 1998, with the release of the film Rounders and the introduction of online poker at Planet Poker. These events built on the occasional telecasts of the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Events that were recorded each summer and broadcast later in the year. Two specific 2003 triggers completed the launch of the poker boom. In the spring of 2003, the World Poker Tour's inaugural season debuted on the Travel Channel on American cable television. The impact of the boom was escalated in May 2003, when amateur Chris Moneymaker won the 2003 WSOP Main Event. Moneymaker won his seat via a $86 satellite tournament on the PokerStars online poker room. Moneymaker was one of 839 entrants in the 2003 event, an increase of roughly 200 players from 2002 and almost doubling the 393 competitors that played in 1999. By the next year, the field in the 2004 Main Event more than tripled to 2576 players. By the 2006 Main Event, there were 8773 competitors, some 14 times as many as had entered the last 2002 pre-boom Main Event. It is also believed that the NHL lockout of 2004-05, and the subsequent filling of ESPN air time with poker programming influenced the poker boom. Another view holds that the poker boom was a classic speculative bubble. Decline The end of the boom is generally considered to be October 2006, when the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) became law in the United States, and several online poker sites, including the industry leader at the time, Party Poker, left the United States. In the first WSOP following the passage of UIGEA, attendance in the WSOP Main Event dropped nearly 28%, from 8773 in 2006 to 6358 at the 2007 Main Event. The game today remains much more popular than the pre-boom period, with WSOP Main Event attendance having stabilized near the 2007 level, in part due to higher growth levels internationally. Based on the 6685 entries to the July 2011 launch of the 2011 Main Event, it appears that the \\"Black Friday\\" indictments, on April 15, 2011, have not reduced the recent level of poker activity. Three of the biggest online poker sites serving players in the United States had their web domains seized and shut down by U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which alleged they were in violation of federal bank fraud and money laundering laws. Nevertheless, two of them continue to serve the international player pool, and numerous smaller sites continue to allow U.S. players.

It was established by Ratan Patodi in early 1962. The magazine's main goal is to preserve the literature of Indian Wrestling. Wrestling has been in existence in India since ancient times. This ancient tradition has a significant place in Hindu mythology as Lord Hanuman and Lord Krishna loved to wrestle (‡§ï‡•Å‡§∂‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä). Patodi has made extreme efforts to compile every possible piece on wrestling in the magazine. This magazine offers information today of classic wrestlers and their achievements such as The Great Gama.  History  While working at Naiduniya, Dada Ratan Patodi became the compositor. He once encountered an opportunity to work as a screenwriter. Abhay Chajjlani, owner of Naiduniya Corp., asked Patodi to write an article on Indian wrestling. He was very fond of wrestling and so stepped up to write on the subject. This article eventually led to the formation of Bhartiya Kushti Patrika. When the magazine started, the managing committee of the Naiduniya newspaper got angry and Patodi had to resign. As of 2012, the magazine had reached its 51st year of continuous publication, now as a monthly. In 2009, American Fehl M. Cannon having searched a lot about the Indian wrestling or Pehlwani on the Internet, learned of Bhartiya Kushti Patrika and contacted them through their Indian representative, Ms. Jyotika Bhambri. He preserved the archive through various modern techniques. At 81, Patodi is still publishing. He intends to continue at least until reaching 100.

Plot  Upon release from prison, Bill (Robert Hill) and his son Karl (Robin Hill) arrive home at Down Terrace in Brighton. With the help of his wife Maggie (Julia Deakin), Bill decides to find the rat in his criminal organization and a tale of recrimination, betrayal and murder ensues. Meanwhile, Karl grows increasingly edgy and uncomfortable with his dysfunctional family. When Karl's girlfriend Valda shows up visibly pregnant, he hosts a dinner for her to meet his parents that does not end well. Karl announces that they plan to get married, but his parents disapprove and demand that he get a paternity test. Bill's employee Garvey tells Karl that Valda dated Garvey's brother for a while recently, which enrages Karl; Karl murders Garvey and enlists his uncle Eric's help in secretly burying the body. Worried about Garvey's unexplained disappearance and that a hitman, Pringle, might talk about a previous attempt on Garvey's life, Bill orders Eric to murder Pringle and his mother, leaving his three- year-old son fatherless. The carnage attracts Jony, a London gangster, who tells Bill that the lack of subtlety and stability has put Karl and his family at risk; Maggie promises to rein in Bill. Eric himself is poisoned by his sister Maggie because she doubts his loyalty to the family's criminal organization. Karl, who suspects that his parents have murdered Eric, accuses them of making deals with the police after he hears a death-bed confession from Berman, their lawyer. Eventually, Valda talks Karl into murdering his parents: Karl shoots his father to death, and Valda lures his mother to an isolated farm and stabs her to death.

The band has a Horror punk inspired look and writes songs about Bigfoot. They have released three studio albums so far. History Formed in early 2005, the band was formed by singer Jeff Sisson, drummer Chris Wilson, and guitarist Jack Riedel. Soon after the creation of the band they were joined by bassist Gary Wray, who formerly played for The Feds and Fire Theory. After Gary Wray's departure from the band in early 2006, bassist Ben Von Schiefelbusch soon joined the band. Troglodyte released their demo CD 'Anthropoid Effigy Demos' in 2008. Soon they were joined by a second guitar player Jeremy Bruen, who was in the band for about 6 months. During the next few years Troglodyte played numerous shows with national acts such as Testament, Iced Earth, Obituary, Origin, among others. The band was featured in the No. 111 issue of Rue Morgue Magazine. In early 2010 they recorded their debut album \\"Welcome to Boggy Creek\\". Welcome to Boggy Creek was released in May 2011. In October 2012, they released their second album \\"Don't Go In The Woods\\". January 2016 saw the release of the band's third album \\"Anthropological Curiosities and Unearthed Archaeological Relics\\". Controversy During a show at the Granada Theater in October 2016, the band had a character come on stage holding a \\"Bigfoot Lives Matter\\" sign (a parody of the Black Lives Matter movement). After a local media group complained about the sign, the Granada issued a statement about the matter stating the band had apologized and did not mean for the sign to mock the movement. Musical style, Image and Influences Troglodyte in 2016. Troglodyte's music is extreme death metal featuring melodic breakdowns. They write songs primarily about Sasquatch, Bigfoot. They have also written songs about Ric Flair and Harry and the Hendersons. Musically, the band is inspired by Carcass, Obituary, Origin and 70's horror films including The Legend of Boggy Creek, The Pit, and Night of the Demon. the Pitch described the band as having \\"unrelenting ferocity\\" and stating they \\"pummel listeners with speed before unleashing an onslaught of teeth-gnashing slow grooves.\\" The band's style has been described as 'relentless' and 'melodic'. Sisson is quoted about the style of the band as saying \\"We're an extreme metal band. I mean, we sing in masks about Bigfoot. It's kind of alienating, but people really get behind it.\\" During shows, a stage hand sprays the crowd with fake blood (usually red and blue Kool-Aid). The band wears masks created by lead singer Jeff Sisson, who is also a movie special effects artist.

Slouch socks also tend to have a foot that is made of very thin fabric, to encourage layering of the socks. A popular 1980s fashion trend involved wearing multiple pairs of slouch socks to create a very thick, heavy slouching affect around the wearer's ankles. Slouch socks Slouch socks come in two primary varieties. \\"Flat-knit\\" slouch socks have no elastic and have a \\"two by two\\" knitting pattern. A popular example of this style of sock is the Wigwam 622 Slouch Sock, which for many years was one of the best- selling varieties of slouch socks in America.[Wigwam 622 Slouch Sock. http://www.sockcompany.com/622.html] The \\"flat-knit\\" term comes from the fact that the ribbing of the socks has a relatively squared-off appearance. \\"Rib- knit\\" slouch socks are so-named because of their rounded ribbing. This is the style of slouch socks typically worn by waitresses at popular restaurants such as Hooters and Wing House. Slouch socks were a popular fashion item from roughly 1984 to 1996-97 for both men, women, college age, teens and kids. Many women and girls wore black leggings or lime green leggings with white slouch socks, athletic sneakers and oversized T-shirts or sweatshirts as casual wear or exercise wear. Also the slouch socks worn over leggings can be smart casual when worn with a nice tunic or v neck sweater with a turtleneck or other layering shirt underneath or a nice longer or oversized tunic. Cheerleaders wore slouch socks along with Keds as part of their uniform until the early to mid 1990s when other styles of cheerleading shoes began being worn with the slouch socks until the late 90's when slouch socks brgan to be replaced by crew or ankle socks. Also many girls, teens, college girls, and women wore the slouch socks usually over leggings or sometimes sweatpants usually with Keds and oversized tee shirts, sweatshirts sometimes with a turtleneck under the sweatshirt, or sweaters. A v-neck sweater with a turtleneck under it was popular. Or they wore the slouch socks with babydoll or skater dresses or dress shorts all worn with white Wigwam slouch socks worn over black opaque tights with Keds. Or sometimes with flat ankle boots. Also the socks were worn with jeans or pants rolled or cuffed to show the socks or worn over skinny legged jeans. They also wore slouch socks in warmer weather with capri leggings, bike shorts, casual or dress shorts, shortalls or bike shorts in many colors usually black or white and sometimes trimmed with lace under babydoll dresses, or skater dresses usually with Keds or sometimes with flat ankle boots or athletic sneakers. Boat shoes and cross training sport sneakers were also worn with slouch socks. Many women, college age, teens, and tweens wore slouch socks as part of aerobic exercise wear or over sports leggings in colder weather for running, cross country and other sports. Also popular during the 1980s was for women to wear slouch socks with pantyhose and a mini- skirt when going out to dance clubs. Boys, teens, college age and men wore slouch socks with boat shoes and cross training and other athletic sneakers with jeans or pants rolled or cuffed to show the socks and with casual or dress shorts, sweatpants or over sports leggings in colder weather for running, cross country and other sports. Slouch socks seem to be gaining in popularity again, partly as a result of the popularity of Manga and Cosplay culture. Japanese style \\"loose socks\\", an exaggerated form of slouch sock with heavily ribbed uppers ranging from 24\\" to 48\\" in length, and \\"super loose socks\\" with uppers that can range from 48\\" to 72\\" in length are available from various web retailers. One look that's growing in popularity is to wear a pair of loose socks with leggings and a pair of calf length boots, with the socks slouched down over the top of the boots. The winter sock selections in 2012 show a distinct trend towards longer, thicker and slouchier socks, with both men's and women's styles featuring loose-fitting knit fabrics and heavily ribbed uppers. For men slouch socks was a part of body building fashion often worn with mutli-colored and patterned sweatpants tucked in. Layering the socks was not uncommon for men either, both with different colors or several white pairs over each other as an example. To a less degree in boxing were tube socks was more common. The socks was not uncommon on basketball courts either, normally layered white slouch socks and sometimes slouch socks over tube socks. Basketball high tops and buffalo shoes were normally worn together with the slouch socks and basketball shorts with oversized T-shirts and/ or basketball tops as well. Both types describe above was used by men as well. Men was often less tidy about the slouching than woman and the slouching was often more random. Often the outer sock more or less covered the inner one so the effect was more of one pair of thick pair of socks than two or three pairs clearly visible.

He then joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology for his master's degree and went on to take a doctoral degree for experimental work on boundary layers. After completion the Sc.D., Launder returned to Imperial College in 1964 to join the faculty as lecturer and later became the Reader in Fluid Mechanics. After serving at Imperial College for 12 years, Launder went to the University of California, Davis in 1976 where he served as Professor of Mechanical Engineering for four years. In 1980, he returned to the UK and joined University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology as the head of the Thermo-Fluids Division. a position he discharged for 16 years as well as two terms as Head of Department Work and recognition Launder's main focus of research is the turbulence modelling for computational fluid dynamics. The k-epsilon model introduced by W. P. Jones and Launder is considered to be the most popular k-epsilon model in the turbulence modelling community. They introduced this model in the 1972 paper titled \\"The prediction of laminarization with a two-equation model of turbulence\\" and is often referred to as the Standard k-epsilon model. Launder also developed, along with his co-workers Gordon J. Reece and Wolfgang Rodi, a second order closure model, known as Launder‚ÄìReece‚ÄìRodi model (1975), which became one of the most thoroughly tested turbulence models.This Week's Citation Classic In recognition of his contribution to turbulence modelling, Launder has been admitted as a Fellow of the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering.

Near the village are the sources of the Beleshnica river, one of the largest tributaries of the Treska river, which in turn flows into Lake Kozjak several kilometers downstream from their confluence. In the surrounding mountains three cave systems can be found: those of Momichak, Laparnica and Gulubarnica. Name Concerning the name Belica, there exist two theories: One states that the name is derived from the clear white water of the Beleshnica river which springs near the village center. According to another theory, the village name is linked to the tragic legend of a local young girl, called Belaica, who trew herself from the rocks into the river after being forced to become the wife of a Turkish ruler.

Early life Nuruzzaman was born on 24 March 1925. He received his education from the exclusive St. Xavier's College, Calcutta majoring in chemistry.  Career  He joined the British Indian Navy in 1943 but due to Jawaharlal Nehru's persuasion, he transferred to the army in 1946 and completed his training from Royal School of Artillery in UK. After partition of India in 1947 he joined Pakistan army & was promoted to Major in 1954. Before retiring from the armed forces he served at East Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation. Since he was a Bengali in the Pakistan Army, he was subject to racial discrimination. He did not sacrifice his dignity, and one such example was his comment against Ayub Khan. In October 1958 after General Ayub Khan declared Martial Law in Pakistan, he & Major Salauddin Amin were the only two officers who refused to sign a document of allegiance pledging loyalty to then President of Pakistan, General Ayub Khan. Bangladesh Liberation War In 1971, he joined the Liberation War. He was senior to all the sector commanders & was given staff position by C-in-C Osmani. During the war, Bangladesh was divided into eleven sectors and each of those sectors had a Sector Commander who would direct the guerrilla warfare. He succeeded Major Najmul Haque as Commander of Sector 7 who died in a road crash on Nov 26, 1971 in India. He played a key role in Bangladesh's achieving independence from Pakistan during the 1971 war. Post war he was tasked with gathering injured freedom fighters from Kolkata.  Award  He was awarded the Bir Uttom award, which is the second-highest award for individual gallantry in Bangladesh. As thousands of Mukti Bahini volunteers, mostly farmers, were killed and did not receive any recognition, he chose not to accept any gallantry award. He rejected the Bir Uttom award.

Education  Howells was born in Cardiff (Wales) in 1947, but grew up in Warwick and attended Leamington College from 1959 to 1966. He took his first degree (BA) at the University of Kent at Canterbury, graduating in 1966. Howells then studied (part-time) for his PhD at the London School of Economics from 1970 to 1976 working at the boundaries of economics, history and philosophy. The title of his thesis was 'Economic Theory in Historical Explanation'.  Learning / teaching interests  Howells began his teaching career in 1969 at the North East London Polytechnic and stayed until 2003, by which time the institution had evolved into the University of East London. His initial interests were in 20th Century Economic History, but force of circumstance, and an interest in the work of Keynes, persuaded him to take up macro economics and then monetary economics. In his final years at UEL, Howells held the post of Professor of Economics and was teaching U/G Macroeconomics and U/G and P/G courses in Monetary Economics. His approach to monetary economics was colored by the belief that monetary developments (particularly in the policy area) are difficult to understand without an appreciation of how financial markets work. This theme has recurred throughout a number of his textbooks and other publications. In 2003 Howells moved to the University of the West of England, firstly as Reader in Economics and then as Professor of Monetary Economics. At UWE he taught: U/G level 2: Macroeconomics; Economics of Money and Banking P/G: Principles and Practice of Banking; Monetary Economics; Financial Economics; and was a founding member of the University's Centre for Global Finance. While at UEL and UWE, Howells supervised more than a dozen PhDs to completion. After several earlier attempts, he finally retired from teaching in 2013, but retains contacts at UWE as Professor Emeritus in Monetary Economics.  Research / consultancy interests  Howells' earliest publications were inspired by the debate over the role of monetary aggregates, where he supported the Post-Keynesian view that the money supply was endogenously created by the demand for credit. However, he disagreed with the more extreme position espoused by Basil Moore and others who said that because the demand for credit was determined by nominal output (‚Äòthe state of trade‚Äô) the money supply was an entirely passive variable whose trajectory had little causal relevance to output and/or the price level. The problem for Howells was that the demand for credit depended on many factors other than the state of trade since borrowing was undertaken to finance all kinds of expenditures, many of them well remote from production. (The demand for mortgages to finance an increasingly speculative housing market in the UK was a good example). Furthermore, since we can show that total transactions are a large and unstable multiple of GDP, we must expect large fluctuations in monetary growth, independent of the path of GDP. The distinction between GDP and total transactions, generally overlooked in modern macroeconomics, has its roots in Irving FisherI Fisher (1911), The Purchasing Power of Money (New York: Macmillan) and J M Keynes.J M Keynes (1930) The Treatise on Money (London: Macmillan) (Volume V in the RES/Macmillan, Collected Writings of JM Keynes, 1971). More recently publications have focused on aspects of monetary policy design, expressing rather sceptical views about the importance of central bank independence and the transparency of policy-making. Howellshas held external examiner positions at a number of UK universities and was a Consultant at the Open University 2009‚Äì12 advising on the development of courses in personal finance and macroeconomics.

Members of the Wisconsin Legislature: 1848 ‚Äì 1999. State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau Informational Bulletin 99-1, September 1999  Background  Coleman was born July 6, 1878 on a farm at Sioux City, Iowa, where his parents (father from Theresa in Dodge County; mother from Byron in Fond du Lac County) had settled in 1877. During the year his parents returned to Wisconsin, due to a grasshopper plague and Indian disturbances, settling on a farm in Fond du Lac County, where he was educated in the public schools. He moved to Milwaukee in 1899, and became a house painter by trade, and an active member of the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paperhangers Union of America. He worked as a union organizer for the Painters' Union, the Milwaukee Federated Trades Council and the Wisconsin State Federation of Labor, and rose to be a member of the executive boards of the Council and the Federation.  Politics  In 1908, Coleman came within nine votes of unseating incumbent Republican State Representative Herman Georgi. In 1920, Coleman was the Socialist candidate for governor, coming in third in a four-way race and receiving 71,104 votes, the highest vote ever cast for a Socialist candidate for that office to that date. When elected to the Assembly in 1924, he had already been an Alderman-at-Large on the Milwaukee Common Council, and was serving as state secretary and organizer of the Socialist Party of Wisconsin. In 1924, he succeeded fellow Socialist Albert F. Woller in the Twentieth Milwaukee County Assembly district (the 20th ward of the City of Milwaukee), defeating former State Representative Republican Charles Meising (whom Woller had unseated in 1922), 4,232 to 3,492. He was assigned to the standing committee on labor. In 1926, Coleman was re-elected with 3327 votes to 2679 for Meising and 2763 for Democrat Gustin Schwarn. Coleman did not run for re-election in 1928, and was succeeded by Republican Norman R. Klug.

It was the 63rd political party to be founded in the country. In February 2013, the party merged with the Action Congress of Nigeria, the All Nigeria Peoples Party, and a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance to form the All Progressives Congress. Foundation The Congress for Progressive Change originated in The Buhari Organization (TBO) formed in 2006 by General Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler of Nigeria, and his associates. The first National Chairman was Kano Central senator Rufai Hanga. After the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) nominated Buhari as its 2007 presidential candidate, TBO worked with the ANPP in the election campaign, but there was friction between the two groups. Following the April 2007 elections, in which President Umaru Yar'adua was elected, Buhari instituted a court appeal against the result. The ANPP decided to join Yar'Adua in his government of national unity, and attempted to persuade Buhari to withdraw the suit, indicating lack of full support for Buhari in the ANPP. Buhari decided that he needed a new platform to support his political ambitions. The Congress for Progressive Change filed an application to register with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on 26 March 2009, and received official approval and registration on 28 December 2009. The majority of its initial members were formerly members of the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP). Buhari formally left the ANPP and joined the CPC in March 2010. He said that he had supported foundation of the CPC \\"as a solution to the debilitating, ethical and ideological conflicts in my former party the ANPP\\". In January 2011, a former Information Minister, Prince Tony Momoh, became the National Chairman of the party. The National Secretary of the party was Engineer Buba Galadima, a founding member. Rufai Hanga, the former chairman and now an aspirant for governor of Kano State, was present at the meeting where Momoh was selected. Ideology The agenda of the CPC supports individual liberty, rights and social welfare for the less privileged. The party advocates political liberalism, as originated by the American philosopher, John Rawls. The party's manifesto insists on the amendment of the Nigerian constitution with the view of devolving powers, duties and responsibilities to states and local governments in order to entrench federalism and the federal spirit. The party constitution is silent on the issue of zoning, a common practice in Nigeria under which key positions are allocated in rotation to representatives from each region of the country. April 2011 elections There were various problems with ballot papers in the April 2011 elections. The CPC found that just before the elections, its logo was missing from ballot papers in some constituencies of Ogun, Jigawa, Gombe, Anambra, Imo and Rivers states. Prince Tony Momoh protested in a strong letter to Professor Attahiru Jega, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). He described the omission as \\"a premeditated attempt to prevent our numerous supporters from voting for those they believe can bring the change they demand to their lives\\". Although the CPC had rapidly gained support in the North of Nigeria, fielding many candidates in the National elections in April 2011, it did not have the same financial resources as the incumbent People's Democratic Party (PDP). Elections were held for most seats in the National Assembly Senate and House of Representatives on 9 April 2011, although some had to be delayed due to problems with ballot papers. In the first round of elections held on 9 April, the CPC came third in both Senate and House seats gained. In the Senate, the PDP won 53 seats, followed by the ACN (Action Congress of Nigeria) with 13 seats, CPC 6 seats, ANPP 4 seats and other parties took 4 seats. In the House, the PDP gained 123 seats, ACN 45, CPC 21, ANPP 11 and other parties 18 seats. Mohammadu Buhari ran as the CPC candidate in the presidential election held on 16 April 2011. He won 12,214,853 votes, coming second to the incumbent president Goodluck Jonathan of the PDP, who polled 22,495,187 votes and was declared the winner. The election, considered to have been conducted much more fairly than past contests, revealed extreme polarization between North and South. Buhari won in all the northern states, while Jonathan won in all middle-belt and south states apart from Osun State, where Nuhu Ribadu gained the most votes. Turnout was considerably higher in the south than in the north, although the north has more voters. Following the election, the CPC said it was considering going to court to challenge the result, which it said was marred by widespread irregularities, particularly in the South East and South South zones. Subsequent events In an interview in November 2011, former Senator Rufai Hanga stated that he had not resigned as chairman to contest the Kano State governorship election. He said he was still chairman of the party, and had gone to court to get this recognized. In February 2012, Chief Dennis Aghanya, a leading member of the Hanga faction, said the CPC must resolve internal disputes. He also criticized the Momoh faction for constantly making confrontational statements after each political development in the country, saying \\"Society looks at us as a bunch of rascals\\". In February 2012, Rufai Hanga served notice through the Federal High Court, Abuja on the CPC national secretariat to vacate their premises which they were renting from him. In March 2012, he said he was not proceeding with the action. The CPC merged with several other parties into the All Progressives Congress in 2013.

The band was founded by Dorian Deveraux as a solo outlet after his departure from Jesus on Extasy in 2010 and later joined by Pee Wee Vignold (formerly with The Eternal Afflict, Pzychobitch). The band is following a strict DIY approach, operating outside the traditional music industry structures. Instead, they are giving away their music for free on their website as well as on various other music platforms across the web. In a statement on their website, they explained how they felt the album format has become \\"useless\\" to \\"bands that are new to the scene\\" and announced to release singles only. History On February 2, 2011 the band debuted with their first single King Of My World which was released under a Creative Commons license and can be downloaded from their website for free in 320 kbit/s MP3, 16-bit WAV and 24-bit WAV format. The song was produced with Tim Schuldt at 4CN-Studios. Also released was a remix / mashup kit containing 25 single Stems from the track that still remains available. Subsequently, the song was remixed by Killing The DJ, Our Banshee, Aesthetic Violence, Graveyard Child Escape and MC1R. All remixes have been released for free on the FTANNG! official website. On April 1, 2011 the band announced having signed to Universal Music for a three-album deal. The supposed debut album King Of My World ‚Äì The very, very best of FTANNG! was announced to be produced by Butch Vig and Linda Perry and to contain the debut single of the same name in various versions including a version featuring Ke$ha plus a cover version of Star Trekkin' by The Firm. This turned out to be an April Fools Joke to announce to release of their second single Waves which debuted on April 16, 2011 as a roughly cut full-length preview. Upon their debut the band has received international recognition by the alternative music press as well as radio airplay. To gain further independence from external media outlets the band has invited their fans to a Q&A; via their tumblelog on April 17, 2011. After the release of Waves, the band went on an unannounced two-year hiatus. During the time, the musicians have worked with an independent theater ensemble and provided sound design to a production of the stage play Astoria by Austrian playwright Jura Soyfer, produced music for an unreleased short film and admittedly got creatively stuck over producing a cover version of Once in a Lifetime by Talking Heads. Additionally, Deveraux has worked as an extra on the sets of Lars von Trier's Nymphomaniac as well as of an episode of Schimanski, a spin-off of the long-running German/Austrian/Swiss crime television series Tatort. In September 2013, FTANNG! returned with the free online release of their third single Meaning in various formats via their website as well as multiple online platforms such as the iTunes Store, AmazonMP3 or Google Play Music. Once again produced at 4CN-Studios by Tim Schuldt it was released in two different versions: a regular version, mastered to achieve maximum loudness on earphone-based mobile devices such as smart phones; plus an audiophile version, mastered for playback on home or car hi-fi systems, which attempts to capture the full dynamic range of the song as experienced in the studio.

It controls the development process in the tasks of compilation and packaging to testing, deployment, and publishing. The methodology of Gradle builds on the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven, and introduces a Groovy-based domain- specific language, rather than using the XML form used by Maven for declaring the project configuration. Gradle uses a directed acyclic graph to determine the order in which tasks can be run, through providing dependency management. Gradle was designed for multi-project builds, which can grow to be large. It operates based on a series of build tasks that can run serially or in parallel. Incremental builds are supported by determining the parts of the build tree that are already up to date; any task dependent only on those parts does not need to be re-executed. It also supports caching of build components, potentially across a shared network. It produces web-based build visualization. The software is extensible for new features and programming languages with a plugin subsystem. Gradle is distributed as open-source software under the Apache License 2.0, and was first released in 2007. History As of 2016 the initial plugins were primarily focused on Java, Groovy and Scala development and deployment. Example Java project In this example, the Maven directory structure is used for Java sources and resources. These directories are src/main/java, src/main/resources, src/test/java, and src/test/resources. =File build.gradle= apply plugin: 'java' Running the build task (gradle build) results in the console log: > gradle build :compileJava :processResources :classes :jar :assemble :compileTestJava :processTestResources :testClasses :test :check :build BUILD SUCCESSFUL The Java plugin emulates many of the expected Maven lifecycles as tasks in the directed acyclic graph of dependencies for the inputs and outputs of each task. For this simple case, the build task depends upon the outputs of the check and assemble tasks. Likewise, check depends upon test, and assemble depends upon jar. For projects that do not follow the Maven conventions, Gradle allows the directory structure to be configured. The following example would support a project that contains source files in src/java rather than the src/main/java convention enforced by Maven. =File build.gradle= apply plugin: 'java' sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs = ['src/java'] Example Ant migration Gradle is tightly integrated with Ant, and even treats Ant build files as scripts that could be directly imported while building. This example shows a simplistic Ant target being incorporated as a Gradle task. =File build.xml= =File build.gradle= ant.importBuild 'build.xml' Running the command gradle ant.target results in > gradle ant.target :ant.target [ant:echo] Running ant.target!

The weather vane on the summit, in the shape of a tin monk, is visible from afar and acts as a navigation aid. The M√∂nchsloch, a shelter for the guard post on the rock castle In the Middle Ages the rock was used as a lookout for Neurathen Castle due to its prominent location. From that time stems the M√∂nchsloch (\\"Monk's Hole\\") hewn out of the rock just below the summit, a shelter about 1.75 metres high and 1.35 metres deep that was used by the guard post of the castle. The rock castle was destroyed in 1469 and fell into ruins. With it disappeared the medieval staircase that enabled the M√∂nch to be climbed, although traces of the timber beams remain today. Since that time the summit may only be reached by climbing. The rocks were occasionally climbed thereafter; tradition recording ascents in the years 1632, 1777 and 1803. After gymnasts from Bad Schandau had made the first recreational ascent of the Falkenstein in 1864, the first ascent of the M√∂nch for similar reasons followed 10 years later, in 1874, made by O. Ufer and H. Frick. This was the first ascent of a climbing rock in Saxon Switzerland without artificial aids; whereas hitherto ladders or artificially hewn steps and the like had been used. Climbing without artificial aids is still an important point in the Saxon climbing rules valid today. The Southeast Way (S√ºdostweg) used by Ufer and Frick (Saxon climbing grade III) is still a popular climbing route today. Since the first recreational ascent of the M√∂nch, a multitude of other climbing routes have been opened. Even well-known climbers like Oscar Schuster, Rudolf Fehrmann, Emanuel Strubich and Bernd Arnold have made the first ascent of climbing routes on the M√∂nch. The most difficult ascents in the north face reach levels of difficulty of Saxon grade ten. The weather vane on the M√∂nch In 1887 a weather vane was erected on the M√∂nch, as was common on other peaks in the area in those times. The vane was in the shape of a monk's silhouette. Whilst most of the weather vanes and summit symbols were destroyed or dismantled again in the succeeding decades, that on the M√∂nch was one of the few that remained in Saxon Switzerland. The original figure suffered damage, in 1928 and 1930, and was replaced in 1957 by a faithful replica. The original monk of 1887 may be seen in the museum in Bad Schandau.

The album was well-received by critics, scoring 84% on six reviews in Metacritic which means \\"universal acclaim\\". Overview For the recording of Folk Art Lovano formed a new band he called Us Five, featuring rising star Esperanza Spalding on bass and pianist James Weidman, who accompanied vocalists Abbey Lincoln and Cassandra Wilson, and (like Wilson) was associated with the M-Base collective. With Francisco Mela and Otis Brown III two drummers completed the unusual quintet. It was the first album with compositions exclusively written by Lovano. With the liberated spirit of the 1960s avant-garde and the subsequent loft scene in mind, the interpretations ought to be \\"loose and joyous\\".Folk Art on Lovano's homepage. Reception John Fordham of The Guardian noted \\"It's Lovano's 21st album for Blue Note - and one of his freest, letting group relations go where they will. The melodies are full of character: the wheeling theme of the title track unfolds over a piano vamp, with an eerie, nursery rhyme-like motif as the countermelody... Lovano pulls no punches here, but his lyrical instincts are also strong; Folk Art remains as accessible as its title implies it ought to be\\". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times commented \\"‚ÄúFolk Art‚Äù might be his woolliest album. It‚Äôs a bit out of focus, perhaps intentionally. Made with his new band, Us Five, it‚Äôs sketchy, groovy and a little burdensome. The album isn‚Äôt set up as a reference to any one composer, style or period, but we‚Äôre strangely deep into the early 1970s here\\". Will Layman of PopMatters commented \\"At this stage of the game, Joe Lovano's name guarantees a certain level of quality in jazz. His boundless imagination has promised great playing, but it has also generated a somewhat restless recording career, with a different band or approach on nearly every recording. With Us Five, Lovano has found a flexible and exciting working band, a group that can play down the center or off on the side, that can swing joyously or reach for the heights of abstraction. Here's hoping that Lovano and Blue Note love this band as much as it deserves to be loved. More please\\".

It is a Category I heritage building registered with Heritage New Zealand. From 1887 to 1924 it was used by Christchurch City Council as their civic offices, providing room for meetings of the council and for housing staff, before they moved to the Civic. It was then used for many decades by the Canterbury Chamber of Commerce and served as the main tourist information. These days it is an exhibition and events centre. History The Christchurch Land Office (foreground) in 1860 =Civic offices= The Christchurch Municipal Council first met in 1862. Later that year, it became the Christchurch City Council. The council used Christchurch's first public building, the Christchurch Land Office, as their meeting venue and for housing council employees. The Land Office was built in 1851 on Oxford Terrace on the banks of the Avon River, just north of where the Worcester Street bridge crossed the river. The building had various public uses. It was built on Reserve 10, which was a section of land reserved for public buildings. In 1879, the council administration had run out of room in the Land Office, and a competition for new civic offices and a town hall (i.e. a venue for large gatherings) for what is later known as Victoria Square was announced. After all the competition entries proved too expensive, the project was abandoned. Civic offices in 1890 Another competition was called for in 1885, this time for just civic offices (i.e. for a council meeting venue and for staff), and on the same site as the Land Office. Controversy erupted when the competition was won by Samuel Hurst Seager; he was young and relatively inexperienced, and his design in Queen Anne style was an architectural type unfamiliar to New Zealand. Construction began in 1886, but the controversy continued when councillor Samuel Paull Andrews claimed the building was structurally unsound. Benjamin Mountfort and John Whitelaw, both architects, and Edward Dobson, an engineer, reviewed the design and the building and found everything to be safe. The only suggestion they made was to strengthen the roof in a different, more costly way than designed by Seager. The building was completed on 24 March 1887 and council met for the first time in their new premises on 4 April 1887. The south fa√ßade of the building has two terracotta sculptures by George Frampton that represent 'Industry' and 'Concord'. In 1919, Council concluded that their premises were once again too cramped and started looking for an alternative. A bill was put to Parliament, seeking permission to extend the building to the north of Reserve 10 on land designated for public gardens or promenades,Christchurch City Reserves Amendment Bill. 1919. NZLII: New Zealand Historical Bills. Retrieved 12 August 2018. but public opposition was too strong and the proposal was dropped. Instead, Council purchased the burned out shell of the northern half of the Agricultural and Industrial Hall in 1920. Construction started in 1922, and the new offices, now known as the Civic, opened on 1 September 1924. In 2010, council moved into their fifth civic office; to date, the Queen Anne design is the only purpose built civic offices in Christchurch. =Other uses= 'Industry' sculpture by George Frampton 'Concord' sculpture by George Frampton Parliament passed a Christchurch Municipal Offices Leasing Act in 1922, which allowed council to lease the building that was situated on Reserve 10. The Canterbury Chamber of Commerce took the lease and held it until 1987. Part of the building was subleased to the Canterbury Promotion Council, later known as Christchurch and Canterbury Marketing, and they were in the building until October 2000. Part of their function was to provide the main tourist information centre for Christchurch. The building was taken over again by the council and opened as an exhibition, event and meeting space for the community in July 2002, branded as Our City O-Tautahi. It is one of Christchurch's major tourist attractions. Our City with heavy bracing following the 2010 Canterbury earthquake in March 2011 =Earthquake damage= Our City was damaged in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and was closed, with heavy bracing installed around the building. The building is insured for NZ$5.8m, but repair options are in excess of that. One of the options has been estimated at NZ$10.5m. Heritage listing On 2 April 1985, the building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now called Heritage New Zealand) as a Category I historic place, with the registration number being 1844. It is a rare example of the Queen Anne style, and at the time was a notable departure from the prevailing Gothic architecture. It was the first major commission for Seager and started his career. The building is a feature in its part of the city.

Hellberg went so far as to suspect that Larsson is not the sole author of the series, reasoning that Larsson was simply not a good enough writer. Gabrielsson has been named as the most likely candidate, due to her chosen wording during at least one interview that seemed to imply co-authorship, although she later claimed she had been misquoted. In 2011 Gabrielsson expressed anger at such accusations and clarified \\"The actual writing, the craftsmanship, was Stieg's. But the content is a different matter. There are a lot of my thoughts, ideas and work in there.\\" As an example she said he used her unfinished book about architect Per Olof Hallman to research locations for the Millennium series and that the two of them physically checked places together and discussed where the characters would live.

History  According to language researchers, the name goes back to the German Schiefe Wand which means \\"inclined wall\\". The present Czech name is a translation of its German name, Sch√§ferwand. As early as the 19th century the Sch√§ferwand (it was then Austrian) was a popular tourist destination due to its striking appearance. As a result it was decided to build a wooden refuge hut that, in 1905, was replaced by a solid wooden building in the shape of a romantic castle, and which still stands on the Sch√§ferwand today. From the terrace of the restaurant there is a picturesque view of the Elbe valley and Dƒõƒç√≠n Castle opposite. After 1945 the zoo from Dƒõƒç√≠n was moved to the plateau.

Kibbutz Eilon in the mid-1960s. Kibbutz Eilon children arrange their clothes in the common closet. The sack of clean laundry lies in front. Communal child rearing was the method of education that prevailed in the collective communities in Israel (kibbutz; plural: kibbutzim), until about the end of the 1980s. Collective education started on the day of birth and went on until adulthood. At the time it was considered a natural outcome of the principle of equality, which was part and parcel of the kibbutz life. The education authority of the kibbutz was responsible for the rearing and well- being of all the children born on the kibbutz, taking care of their food, clothing, and medical treatment. Everybody received the same share of everything. Parents were not involved economically in the upbringing of their children. Children's lives had three focal points: the children's house, parents' house, and the whole kibbutz. They lived in the children's house, where they had communal sleeping arrangements and visited their parents for 2‚Äì3 hours a day. Non-selectivity was a fundamental principle of collective education; every child got 12 years of study, they took no tests whatsoever, and no grades were recorded. The founders of the kibbutz actually aimed at creating \\"the 'new man' of a utopian society.\\"(Gavron, D. (2000). The kibbutz : awakening from Utopia, Lanham. Rowman & Littlefield:157) Three concentric circles of life Collective education was carried out within the boundaries of three concentric circles: the children's house, the parents' house, and the kibbutz community. =Children's house= Kibbutz Afikim children with their nanny at the children's house. Mid 1960s. Kibutz Gan Shmuel 1935-40 A group of children, all about the same age, shared a children's house and had a nanny who took care of their everyday needs. Each house had a dining hall, a classroom, bedrooms (3-4 children in each room), and a bathroom. Boys and girls took showers together during elementary school up to the sixth grade, and usually shared their bedrooms even until the end of high school. This was the kibbutz children's house, where they learned, had their meals, took their showers, slept, and woke up in the morning. This was where they got their clean clothes and from there their dirty laundry was sent, all tied up in a big bundle, back to the collective laundry. Every child had a towel on a hanger in the bathroom and a smaller hand towel near the sink, with a small cup for a toothbrush. Each one also had two closet shelves, one for the morning clothing and another for the afternoon clothing. The nanny was in charge of the daily routine at the children's house. Kibbutz society and educators' role The kibbutz was a collective community, and so was its education system. The kibbutz authorities provided equally for all children born to its members and they shared everything equally. The provision of health and psychological care was according to specific needs. Kibbutz members who were considered the most educated and esteemed got the position of educators. The nanny position was always a woman's role. Teacher positions were both for women and men. =Family and relationships with the parents= The family had no financial responsibility whatsoever; the kibbutz took care of its members' economic affairs. Kibbutz people believed that a woman's work outside of her house conflicted with her duties as a mother. In their eyes the kibbutz achieved women's social and economic liberation without hindering their role as mothers. This, so they claimed, was achieved by shifting the responsibility for education from the family to society at large.(Spiro, Melford E (1966) Children of the kibbutz . New York. Schocken Books:50-67) The founders of the collective education believed that granting the children independence from their family liberated the family from the economic and social burden, which otherwise might distort the children's development. Family was neither the only nor the main focus in the children's education, since they had the educators and the whole kibbutz to support them. While the child's emotional needs were catered for by his or her family, the physical well-being, health care, and education as a whole were entrusted to the educators' expertise.(Gavron, D. (2000). The kibbutz : awakening from Utopia, Lanham. Rowman & Littlefield: 165) Fathers were supposed to bond with their children through quality time much more so than in a non-kibbutz environment, where they may be required to spend long hours at work. Kibbutz people believed that as the necessary demands and requirements that are an essential part of every education process were eliminated from family life, the relationships between parents and their children got a chance to become much more moderate and harmonious. This, so they claimed,(Tiger, L. & Shepher, J. (1976, c1975). Women in the kibbutz, NY. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: 41) is how strong emotional ties with toddlers, friendship in childhood, and comradeship in youth facilitate strong family attachment and healthy influence of parents on their children. Education organization Education organization was divided into stages: * Babies (up to 1 year old) and toddlers (up to the age of 4 years) were kept in small sets of 4-8 children, mostly sextuplets * Kindergarten (ages 4 to 7) was made up of 3 sextuplets, and this group of 14-22 children would stay together until they completed the 12th grade * Children's society ‚Äì first (in some cases only from second) grade up to sixth grade * Youth society ‚Äì seventh grade to twelfth grade =Babies (up to 1 year old) and toddlers= Toddlers in Kibbutz Merom Golan 1968-72 The newborn baby was brought from the hospital directly to the babies' house. The mother would get a six-week parental leave, after which she gradually returned to work, though not before the baby was fully weaned. Every afternoon, the parents would take their baby home for about an hour. In the early years of the kibbutz, parents were not allowed to enter the babies' house freely, as it was considered best to keep the place clean and orderly and let the nanny do her work. As years went by, the attitude became more relaxed in this matter and parents were allowed to visit their offspring during the day, in order to spend time together and establish emotional bonding. In addition to taking care of the baby, it was the nanny's responsibility to support the mothers, especially the young and inexperienced ones. The arrangement of the newborns' house, its equipment and playground, and the correct way of offering toys in the right stage, were all believed to create the proper stimuli and the environment that might best fit babies, in order to avert boredom and satisfy the toddlers' emotional needs.(Bettelheim, B. (1969). The Children of the Dream, London. Macmillan:196-7) Babies were transferred to the toddlers' house by their second year. At that point each sextuplet had its own nanny and her job was to provide each one of the babies an outstanding personal rearing. =Kindergarten (ages 4 to 7)= About three sextuplets comprised a kindergarten group, with their pre-school teacher and nanny. This was regarded as the children's home, which provided intimacy and close relations with peers. This is where they achieved their first level of socialization. Instead of rivalry, aggressiveness, and hatred, they were supposed to get an opportunity for cooperation, mutual support, and compassion. =Children's society ‚Äì first to sixth grade= Children of Kibutz Einat, 1950 The group that was formed during the kindergarten years moved next together with their nanny to the children's society, where they would get a teacher as well. The children's society was composed of the age groups of children from the first or second grade to the sixth grade. Teachers were considered \\"educators\\", some of them women and some men. Nannies were always women. Everyone, children and adults, would call each other by their first names, and relationships were intentionally very familial and informal. The children would choose a name for their group by voting; afterward, they would frequently be referred to by their first name plus the group name, omitting their family name. More often than not, the teacher and nanny would stay with the same group of children up until the end of the sixth grade. Children grew up, studied, slept, and worked together in this wide-ranging educational frame, mostly within their intimate group, and sometimes in the wider children's society. =Youth society ‚Äì 7th to 12th grade= Children in the Kibbutz Givat Haim Meuchad, 1967 As they reached their seventh grade, the group progressed to the youth society, where they stayed until the end of twelfth grade. By this stage the teacher and nanny separated from this group, and the adolescents would get a new team of educators. Many kibbutzim would send their children to a regional school away from home. The teenagers would then live in the dormitories and travel to their kibbutz to meet with their parents only about twice a week. The children in these schools would have their own dining halls. Other kibbutzim maintained a local high school and had their children stay at home, eat in the kibbutz dining hall, and work with the kibbutz members. The founding fathers of the collective education strongly believed that by this age the group held a major significance for its members. This was the place for them to clarify their personal and social concerns, and this way the group was believed to function as the best setting to educate the youngsters and mold their characters.(Tiger, L. & Shepher, J. (1976, c1975). Women in the kibbutz, NY. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: 167) The youth society acted in a manner of directed independence and the student government was guided by the team of educators. At the students' general meeting, all matters concerning campus life were discussed and decided upon, except the school curriculum, security issues, and health matters. All students were expected to work as the semi- professional curriculum was an essential part of school life. Education, teaching, and social life Although all children of the collective education had similar life conditions and even though public opinion was highly considered, educators were proud to stress the fact that individuality remained crystal clear; they were very much willing to support artistic creativity (writing, drawing, and music), journal writing, and reading of books. Social applicability of learning was considered more important than knowledge per se. Putting forth an effort, moral behavior, and social involvement were seen as equivalent to academic achievements, and so was youth movement leadership. Any distinction between formal teaching and other forms of educating was non-existent, and both were under the guidance of the education team. Although collective education was non-selective and all children were entitled to the same learning circumstances, no demand was made to have equal achievements. Children- and youth-societies were considered \\"living organisms made up of dissimilar persons, each needing its individual attention\\".(Golan, 1964:518) =Inter-disciplinary learning= Kibutz Gan Shmuel - inter-disciplinary learning - all about the Bread In order to stay true to life as they understood it, the kibbutz education adopted an inter- disciplinary method of learning. In elementary school, learning was based on children's everyday life: \\"The Bee and the Flower\\", \\"The Ant\\", \\"Mail\\", etc. One interdisciplinary subject would last for two to six weeks, according to age. The high school curriculum was divided in two: Humanistic (literature, geography, society, and economics) and realistic (physics, chemistry, and biology). In addition, the curriculum included languages: Hebrew, English, and Arabic, mathematics, gymnastics, painting, music. =Literary mock-trials= The youth society would gather once a year in order to conduct a literary mock trial. Everybody at school, including students and the education team, would read a book and then debate the dilemma it brought up, such as a controversial character. The school would create a court which had members from all the youth society groups: a defendant, judges, prosecutor, a defense, and witnesses. Judges and lawyers wore black robes and the rest of the participants were dressed up according to their characters. The mock-trial took place in front of the school general assembly. Examples for literary mock-trials were: * Lord of the Flies by William Golding * The Enemy by Pearl S. Buck * To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee =Work= Work was an essential building block of the collective education. Young children worked in their close surroundings, helped clean their home, took care of the school zoological garden, and tended their vegetable garden. High school students worked in the agricultural branches and industries the kibbutz owned. Many high school girls worked as nannies' aides at the younger children's houses. Skills such as weaving, sewing, knitting, metalwork, and carpentry were taught as an intermediary between work and study as a part of the curriculum, so it was possible for diligent students to become semi-professionals. Kibbutz movement education department The similarity of and philosophy of procedures was maintained by the departments of education of the kibbutz movement. They supervised the activities at the schools, had teachers' guidance programs, provided consultation to families of children with specific needs, published, set budgets, and determined the standards. The movement had a school for kibbutz education professional training where they also held a research center.(Near, H. (1992) The Kibbutz Movement: A History. London. Littman Lib.:306) End of collective education The kibbutzim evolved, and since the mid-1950s and much more so since the 1970s education was very much influenced by the changes. People on the kibbutzim wanted their children to live at home and not in the children's house, so communal sleeping arrangements were brought to an end.The Last Kibbutz Standardization of teaching methods and the introduction of examinations to kibbutz schools did away with multi- disciplinary learning. Many of the young generation born on the kibbutz left for the big cities so the kibbutz population shrank and aged. Many kibbutzim went through a process of privatization. Higher education became prevalent, together with a decrease in the prominence of agriculture.(Near, H. (1992) The Kibbutz Movement: A History. London. Littman Lib.: 336-7) All these and other reasons caused the collectivism to deteriorate and individualism to win over. This put an end to collective education. Ora Aviezer explains:Christakis, Nicholas A. Blueprint: The evolutionary origins of a good society. Little, Brown Spark, 2019. > Collective education can be regarded as a failure. The family as the basic > social unit has not been abolished in kibbutzim. On the contrary, familistic > trends have become stronger than ever, and kibbutz parents have reclaimed > their rights to care for their own children. Collective education has not > produced a new type of human being, and any differences found between adults > raised on and off the kibbutz have been minimal.

Made on a relatively small budget, it is known for having an atypical narrative and directorial style, which combines elements of horror, exploitation film making and Southern gothic. It has subsequently become popular in cult and B movie circles. Plot Liz Wetherly is a popular black singer in need of a break from her hectic schedule. When her car breaks down, she ends up stuck in a remote southern town that‚Äòs been left for dead ‚Äúever since they put in the interstate.‚Äù She is forced to spend the night at ‚ÄúBertha‚Äôs Oasis‚Äù, a rundown lodge that serves as the bizarre fiefdom of an overweight ex-burlesque star who lords over her much younger boyfriend, Eddie, and a cast of equally-strange townsfolk. Eddie fancies himself a singer on par with Elvis, and expects Wetherly to make him famous. But things turn ugly for Wetherly, who endures rape and abuse at the hands of her captors, before culminating in her bloody revenge on the ‚Äúrednecks‚Äù that terrorized her. Cast *Leslie Uggams as Liz Wetherly *Shelley Winters as Bertha *Michael Christian as Eddie Collins *Slim Pickens as Sheriff Orville *Dub Taylor as Justice of the Peace Floyd *Ted Cassidy as Keno Background Most of the individuals involved in the production of Poor Pretty Eddie were, at the time, nominally employed in the world of adult films, with the picture representing an opportunity to \\"go straight.\\" According to the DVD's extensive liner notes, they secured backing from Michael Thevis, a notorious Atlanta- based businessman commonly known as ‚ÄúThe King of Pornography‚Äù whose other interests included a chain of sex shops, a record company, and the manufacture of peep show booths. Further motivating Thevis was a desire to launder money he had made through dealings with various Mafia figures, which had attracted the attention of the FBI. Shortly after the film's production, Thevis was jailed on an assortment of charges and, following a prison escape in 1978, was placed on the FBI‚Äôs most-wanted list. The movie's script, loosely based on the Jean Genet play The Balcony, was the work of consummate television writer B. W. Sandefur, who also wrote for such shows as Barnaby Jones, Little House on the Prairie and Charlie's Angels. The film was shot on location in and around Athens, Georgia in 1973. The film‚Äôs biggest star, Shelley Winters, was flown in on a private plane that nearly crashed upon landing. Contemporary reviews for the film were almost unanimously negative, owing to the film's dark racial undercurrents and repeated depictions of rape. One Georgia-based film writer concluded: ‚ÄúUpon leaving the theater, I quite honestly felt nauseous.‚Äù Alternate titles and versions Over the course of its 10-year run at drive- ins and grindhouse theaters, the film was distributed under several different titles, each intended to market the film as belonging to different genres in an attempt to appeal to a variety of demographics: It was retitled \\"Black Vengeance\\" for distribution as a blaxploitation film, The Victim as a vigilante thriller in the vein of Death Wish, and Redneck County and Redneck County Rape for distribution in the American south as a \\"hicksploitation\\" film. Unusually, a wholly alternate version of the film was exhibited under the name \\"Heartbreak Motel.\\" This version‚Äîfeaturing voiceover narration by Eddie‚Äîis edited to present the movie as something resembling a filmed play: numerous action scenes are edited out in favor of lengthy dialogue pieces not present in any other versions, while the film's climactic gun battle is replaced by a sequence in which Eddie obtains a recording contract and leaves Georgia for Nashville. Although the \\"Heartbreak Motel\\" version is noticeably less violent than any other version, and omits most of the film's rape sequences, it also incorporates an anal sex scene between Eddie and Bertha missing from \\"Poor Pretty Eddie,\\" set to an unknown bluegrass group to a song that seems to be called \\"You Don't Have To Say You Love Me In The Morning\\". Home video HD Cinema Classics and Film Chest released the movie on Blu-ray and DVD on April 26, 2011. \\"Poor Pretty Eddie is another public domain feature restored for Blu-ray by HD Cinema Classics/Film Chest. Anyone who doubts any significant restoration beyond overly aggressive DNR was done on this title need only look at the restoration demo included on the disc. The 35mm print utilized for the master is literally littered with virtually nonstop vertical green scratches, most of which have been removed. Color doesn't seem to have been retimed, at least not significantly, and so things have a slightly ruddy cast some of the time. But let's face it. Though filmed in Technicolor (and mid-70s Technicolor was not the Technicolor of yore), this was never a big budget film, and that low budget indie ethos shines (if that's the right word) through virtually every frame of Poor Pretty Eddie. This was never a glossy, pretty film to begin with and it still isn't. The DNR applied means there's an overly smooth texture to this release, but it also means that we have a largely blemish free image. Color is certainly above average, if not mind blowingly robust, given the low budget confines of the original film. Contrast is on the low side, as it obviously has been from day one, and therefore detail tends to get lost in some of the darker interior scenes. The image is also very soft most of the time, but, again, that's how this film looked from day one. But overall, this is the second color film HD Cinema Classics/Film Chest has released in the last week or so (The Terror being the other), and the results, while not perfect, are not as hideously troublesome as those who want grain, and lots of it, seem to think.\\"Poor Pretty Eddie Review at Blu- ray.com See also * List of American films of 1975 References External links Poor Pretty Eddie at Turner Classic Movies *Poor Pretty Eddie Review at Blu-ray.com *Poor Pretty Eddie on Amazon 1970s exploitation films American independent films Films set in Georgia (U.S. state) Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state) 1975 films American films 1975 horror films 1975 independent films Southern Gothic films American horror films ","title":"Poor Pretty Eddie"},{"id":"31568211","text":"Luis Bacque at Searsound Studio A, New York City Luis Bacqu√© is a recording engineer, musician, and record producer based in New York City.

Biography Born in Venarey-les-Laumes as the son of a cabinetmaker, Dampt studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Dijon, then in 1874 under the leadership of Fran√ßois Jouffroy and Paul Dubois at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris . He exhibited for the first time at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais in 1876. In 1877 he took the deuxi√®me Prix de Rome for sculpture at the Ecole. He completed his military service, then organized an Exhibition of the Society of Friends of the Gold Coast to promote art in its region. Dampt's work can be described as Symbolist; at the Mus√©e d'Orsay he is classified as Art Nouveau. Some of Dampt's sculptures are exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts in Dijon. In 1919 Dampt was appointed to chair #7 of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. Dampt's students include the Americans Frederick Ruckstull, Charles Grafly, and Cyrus Edwin Dallin, and the Swiss Jean Dunand. The animalier Fran√ßois Pompon was an assistant.  Les Cinq  In 1895, Dampt was a founding member of the arts group Les Cinq, which sought to apply new mechanical methods to furniture design. The four other founding members were architect Tony Selmersheim, designer Felix Aubert, sculptor and craftsman Alexandre Charpentier, and the painter √âtienne Moreau-N√©laton. Architect Charles Plumet would join in 1896, changing the group's name first to Les Six and then to L'Art pour tous with the later association of Henri Sauvage and others.

It is a member of the family Akidnognathidae. Fossils of Olivierosuchus have been found from the Early Triassic Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone in South Africa. Unlike other akidnognathids such as Moschorhinus, it has a narrow snout and fewer postcanine teeth. As a distinguishing feature, Olivierosuchus also has a sharp ridge near the choana, an opening in the skull palate. Bumps and projections cover the pterygoid, a bone that forms part of the palate. Olivierosuchus was a top predator of the lower Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone (LAZ) and lived alongside other large therapsids like Moschorhinus. The high diversity of akidnognathids in the LAZ suggests that the group recovered quickly from the Permian-Triassic extinction event, a mass extinction in which many other therapsid groups disappeared. A burrow cast described in 2010 from the LAZ has been attributed to Olivierosuchus or a related therocephalian. The burrow is straight and wide and includes an entry ramp and living chamber. Remains of a juvenile Lystrosaurus dicynodont were found in the cast, but the individual was likely too small to dig the burrow. It is possible that the burrow was home to an Olivierosuchus that had stashed the remains of the dicynodont as its prey in the tunnel. Carnivorous tetrapods typically create straight burrows and often store food in them, providing evidence for this interpretation of the South African burrow.

Design & development Bernard Sznycer, designer of the Sznycer SG-VI, the first helicopter certified in Canada, set up the Omega Aircraft Corporation, based at New Bedford, Massachusetts in December 1953, with himself as President and Chief Designer of the company. Omega's first design was a twin- engined flying crane / utility helicopter, intended to be inexpensive to produce and relatively cheap to operate. The helicopter was of conventional layout, with a single four-bladed lift rotor and a two bladed anti-torque rotor. Its fuselage was of pod-and-boom layout, with a small enclosed crew cabin forward connected to an uncovered steel tube tail boom. Cargo, either a slung load or in a pre-loaded pod, could be carried between the crew cabin and the undercarriage mainwheels, while it was planned to also provide a pod to carry passengers. It was powered by twin piston engines mounted horizontally on either side of the main gearbox. Operational history The first example made its maiden flight on December 29, 1956. The type was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration in April 1961. Omega planned to build an initial batch of 25 BS-12-D-1s, which were priced at $77,500, with production gradually building up from one per month. Although Omega received orders for several BS-12s following certification, shortages of funds stopped production, and Omega entered into bankruptcy in July 1962.

He also used the traditional title of Lord of L√°znƒõ Kyn≈ævart and, apart from an intermezzo in 1547, he was Lord of Beƒçov nad Teplou as well.  Life  Henry IV was a member of the elder line of the House of Plauen. He was the son of Burgrave Henry III of Plauen (‚Ä† 1519) from his second marriage to Barbara of Anhalt-K√∂then (1487-1532/33).Berthold Schmidt: Count Henry IV of Meissen, Colonel Chancellor of the Crown of Bohemia and his government in the Vogtland, Gera 1888, p. 38 = Youth = After the death of his father, Henry grew up first under the care of his mother, and, after her remarriage in 1521, under the supervision of a guardian specially appointed by his mother: Zdenko Leo Rosenthal, the High Burgrave to the crown of Bohemia,Berthold Schmidt: Burgrave Henry IV of Meissen, ..., p. 45 on Harten≈°tejn Castle. According to his father's testament of 27 February 1515Berthold Schmidt: Count Henrich IV of Meissen, ..., p. 40 Harten≈°tejn wasonly for him and could not be regarded as part of the dowry of a possible remarriage of his mother. In June 1528 his mother, Barbara divorced from John the Younger of Kolovrat to Ma≈°≈•ov and called herself Burgravine of Meissen again.Berthold Schmidt: Count Henry IV of Meissen, ..., p.46 She left her estate Kr√°sn√Ω Dv≈Ør in Ma≈°≈•ov and went first to Tou≈æim and later, in August 1529, back to her Wittum ≈†tƒõdr√° Castle. Henry asked to join him in Harten≈°tejn, but she refused. = At the court in Prague = His guardian brought him in time to the court in Prague. On 5 April 1530 King Ferdinand reaffirmed the Burgraviate of Meissen as Henry's fief. He wasn't concerned about the Meissen lands: immediately after the death of the last member of the House of Meinhering, the Meissen lands had been seized by troops of Elector Frederick the Warlike of Saxony of the House of Wettin. Henry was concerned about the title and the position associated with it and the seat in the Imperial Diet he was entitled to as sovereign prince.Berthold Schmidt: Count Henry IV of Meissen, ..., p. 55 In 1530, Henry accompanied King Ferdinand as one of the four Schenks to the Diet of Augsburg. On 19 September 1530 Emperor Charles V confirmed his fief. In the summer of 1532 Henry married Margaret, Countess of Salm and Neuburg. The young couple moved in August 1532 to the Andƒõlsk√° Hora Castle. Before Henry had convinced his mother to leave her Wittum and join them. However, she died about half a year later. In 1532 Henry's territory consisted of four baronies: Tou≈æim, Harten≈°tejn, Andƒõlsk√° Hora and Prohor. In 1537 Prohor again belonged to Tou≈æim and Harten≈°tejn and Andƒõlsk√° Hora had been united: an interest an income tax register from this period calls it Andƒõlsk√°-Harten≈°tejn. In July 1537 Henry succeeded in purchasing the barony of Luditz rule. Though it was small, it nicely rounded out his territory.Berthold Schmidt: Count Henry IV of Meissen, ..., p. 60 Also in July 1537, negotiations in Torgau, chaired by the Ernestine Elector John Frederick the Magnanimous, led to a contract of inheritance was agreed with the Lords Reuss of Plauen at Greiz about who would inherit Gera in case the Lord of Gera would die childless.Berthold Schmidt: Count Henry IV of Meissen, ..., p. 59 On 7 August 1550, Henry of Gera died childless at Castle Burgk, and Henry IV inherited his fief. From that point, Henry IV, in fact owned all of the Vogtland, the fief that King Ferdinand had assigned to him. His whole life, Henry IV had to defend himself in quarrels with his half brother Henry the Bastard and after the end of the Schmalkaldic War, he had to deal with litigation by the Reuss family, who tried to regain the Lordship of Gera. On 22 January 1542, King Ferdinand appointed Henry IV to High Chancellor of the Crown of Bohemia, King's Counsel and Treasurer. = Schmalkaldic war = Henry was instrumental in the Treaty of Prague that was sealed on 14 November 1546 between King Ferdinand of Bohemia and the Albertine Duke Maurice of Saxony, implementing the imperial ban against the Ernestine electors of Saxony. As High Chancellor of Bohemia, Henry participated on the side of Ferdinand and his brother, Emperor Charles V in the Battle of M√ºhlberg on 24 April 1547 and in the Capitulation of Wittenberg on 19 May 1547 that ended the Schmalkaldic War. In the same position he was in Prague in late June 1547, where Ferdinand held the Bohemian Diet, which became known as \\"the bloody\\" in history, in which Ferdinand judged over the Bohemian estates and rebellious nobles. From confiscated lands, Henry received the castle and town Beƒçov nad Teplou, which his great-grandfather had bought in 1410 and which his father had sold in 1495 to Lord Pflugk. However, Ferdinand demanded it back shortly thereafter. In September 1547 Henry's troops occupied the castle of Greiz and drove out the princes of the Reuss. On 24 May 1548, by deed of Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Augsburg, Henry IV was made Imperial Princely Burgrave of Meissen. On 21 January 1549, King Ferdinand issued a solemn Patent to Henry of ReussBerthold Schmidt: Count Henry IV of Meissen, ..., p. 232 and Gera. This made Henry officially Lord of Greiz and Gera. The deeds for the purchase of the Lordship of Plauen, Oelsnitz and the district of Pausa followed soon after, on 10 April 1549.Berthold Schmidt: Count Henry IV of Meissen, ..., p. 170 In the summer of 1551 Henry had a time off from his job as Chancellor for the first time in many years and could dedicate himself to his traditional Bohemian dominions and the new dominions in the Vogtland. He called representatives of all Vogtland estates to a common diet in Schleiz he opened on 28 July 1551. In Plauen he established a governor as the supreme authority for all Vogtland estates. For Greiz he issued on 8 September 1551 his first regulation of the judiciary and of the police. On 11 September, these were followed by a drink tax and the Imperial penny regulation. In mid-October, he left the Vogtland, first went to Prague and then to Vienna. He never returned to his Vogtland possessions. Although a Catholic is while life, he fought all attempts at Contra-Reformation of his Vogtland barons, promoted the Protestant Church and in 1552 he adopted a burgraviate Church Constitution, designed by the Protestant superintendent of Plauen. = Peace of Passau and combat against Albert Alcibiades = siege of the castle Plass, contemporary wood engraving by Hans Glaser On 15 and 16 March 1552, Henry IV met Elector Maurice of Saxony in Leipzig and prepared him for a meeting between Maurice and Ferdinand, which took place on 18 April 1552 in Linz. They agreed on principles that formed the foundation for an agreement reached in Passau on 22 Juli 1552. King Ferdinand then asked Henry IV to convince Emperor Charles V and the latter signed the Peace of Passau on 15 August in Munich. During the subsequent Turkish military campaign, Heinrich stayed until the end of November in Gy≈ër. As High Chancellor of Bohemia, Henry IV was actively involved in establishing peace throughout the empire. On 29 June 1553 Henry and Maurice met in Nordhausen and discussed final details of their action against Margrave Albrecht II Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. Shortly thereafter, on 9 July 1553, Maurice was mortally wounded in the Battle of Sievershausen. Henry now took over the role of the leader of the allies against Albert Alcibiades. On 7 August, Henry began the siege of Hof.Kurt Stierstorfer: The Siege of Hof in 1553, Hof 2003, On 28 September the city was captured, but on 11 October it was recaptured by Albert's troops. On 27 November the allies captured Hof again. Henry IV appointed Georg Wolf of Kotzau as governor of Hof. Then the siege of the Plassenburg near Kulmbach began, during which, on the morning of 19 May 1554, Henry IV died in Stadtsteinach. On 24 May he was buried, according to his last wishes in the St John's Church in Plauen.

Eldest hand has the first right to accept or make trumps. As is typical for Schafkopf card games, which are normally point-trick games, the four jacks are known as wenzels and form permanent highest trumps. The German game Kontraspiel is a similar to Polskpas.  Rules of play  Tens are low. The Jacks or Wenzels are the highest members of the trump suit, ranking clubs, spades, hearts and diamonds in descending order. A Jack is not part of its natural suit unless this happens to be the trump suit.. Each of the four players receives 5 cards in batches of 2 and 3. The remaining 4 cards are not usually part of the game, except for the first of them, which is turned face-up to determine the preferred trump suit. Starting with eldest hand, each player gets the chance to become soloist with the preferred suit as trumps. A player who accepts takes the turn-up card and discards a different card instead. If everybody passes, there is a second round in which each player gets the chance to become soloist with a different suit (and without exchanging the turn-up card). In the second round, eldest hand is the only player who is allowed to do this with the preferred suit. If the second round fails as well, the game is not played and the next dealer deals. The standard rules of trick-play as in Whist apply. Eldest hand leads to the first trick. Suit must be followed. The player who played the highest trump, or the highest card of the suit led, wins the trick and leads to the next. To win the game one must win 3 tricks. To make sure that there is always a winner, it is also enough to be the first player to win 2 tricks, so long as the other tricks do not all fall to the same player.  Scoring  The game is played for money and uses a pot for the stakes. The dealer pays one unit into the pot before the game starts. If the soloist wins, he or she wins the contents of the pot. If the soloist loses, he or she doubles the contents of the pot. Up to the third trick, a soloist can announce vole, i.e. undertake to win all five tricks. If successful, the soloist wins the pot plus a fourth of its content in additional payments from each of the three opponents. If not (but the soloist still wins the game), the soloist receives nothing and the pot remains unchanged.  Variations  Three players can play following the same rules, provided that the Nines and one Ten are removed from the pack.  History and etymology  The game appears in a Danish game anthology in 1829, and in a Danish encyclopedia in 1924. An early literary reference to the game was in 1786. Although Polskpas is Danish for Polish passport, it appears more likely that pas refers to the game feature which allows eldest hand to pass rather than being obliged to play with the turn-up suit under all circumstances. A somewhat later German game known as Kontraspiel or Contraspiel is similar to Polskpas, but there are only two Wenzels and the bidding system is more elaborate.

It was completed in 1736 as the first of five \\"High Mass\\" compositions he wrote in the last ten years of his life (Missa Sanctissimae Trinitatis, Missa Votiva - 1740, Missa Dei Patris - 1740, Missa Dei Filii - 1741 and Missa Omnium Sanctorum - 1741). Last three were also called \\"Missae ultimae\\" (Last Masses).  Description \\"Missa Santissimae Trinitis\\" is the composition of combined sacred style - it does not divide the liturgical text only according to the conventional order of mass (Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei), but also into shorter parts which form independent musical movements. In each of them the instrumental grouping, character and style differ. Old and modern techniques are joined, therefore, not only in the sense of changing the individual movements, but they also penetrate each other within. The mass is divided into 19 individual parts. Above all, the choruses reveal the strong influence of contemporary opera and concerto, and solo arias. The solo arias (in Part II, alto, in VI and XV, soprano) are much more extensive than other Zelenka's Mass arias of the 1720s. They are introduced by virtuose ritornellos which go on to demarcate the form. Orchestral parts are independent and rich with melodiously flowing solo voices. Similarly, the concertante choruses (Parts IV, IX and XI) are represented with modern ritornellos. The orchestra parts in these movements also are independent and often dominate over the simple homophonic chorus. The influence of the concerto structure is revealed in the contrast between solo vocal and choral parts. The opposite pole of the chorus concerto are the massive choral fugues - their dialogue here not only demonstrate the composer's technical mastery, but also illustrate the intellectual depth and significance of the work.  Orchestration As with Zelenka's other High Mass compositions there are no brasses in the orchestration, which includes only organ, six violins, two viols, cello, double bass, two oboes, bassoon and archlute, expanded by two solo flutes and a chalumeau.

Western Christian High School is a member of Christian Schools International (CSI). It is one of two private high schools in Hull, along with Trinity Christian High School. History Western Academy began in 1919, with grades nine and ten. The name was selected because there was an Eastern Christian Academy in New Jersey at the time, affiliated with the Christian Reformed Church (CRC), and Western Academy was established to educate CRC members that had settled the furthest west. The school was originally located in a three-story house on Hull's Main Street. In 1934 the school went bankrupt due to the Great Depression and was sold to Calvin College. It was then reorganized and reopened as Western Christian High School. The school's first sports teams were known as the Indians. In the mid-1990s, that mascot was dropped and athletics continued without an official team name until the Wolfpack moniker was chosen in 2005. During the 2017‚Äì18 school year, Western Christian began participating in a student exchange program with . The school's 100th anniversary, which it celebrated in August 2019, was recognized on the floor of the Iowa General Assembly on March 4, 2020. Athletics The boys' basketball team has won nine state titles (1985, 1991, 19969, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2016, 2017). Former coach Jim Eekhoff is fourth among Iowa men's basketball coaches in wins, with 681. Eekhoff eight men's championships are a state record, while his eighteen state tournament appearances have tied a state record. The girls' basketball team has claimed four Class 2A state championships (2012, 2013, 2014, 2017). The volleyball team has won seventeen state titles (1989, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019) and claimed second place in 1999, 2005, and from 2011‚Äì2014. The boys' cross country program won team championships four times. The Wolfpack football team advanced to the state playoffs for the first time in 2015, losing the title game to Regina High School. In 2016, Western defeated Regina to win its first state title in football. The boys' soccer team won the state championship in 1996. The girls' track and field has won three state championships (1977, 1978, 2013). =Facilities= Western's first location was in a three-story house on Hull's Main Street, known as \\"The Mansion.\\" The school building was built in 1924 for $64,000. The first expansion of the 1924 building was completed in 1948, and included a library and science laboratories. In 1957, a gymnasium, locker rooms, a stage, and two classrooms were added for $125,000. In 1964, a space for music was built for $75,000. By 1968, an addition to the science wing was finished for $175,000. A new gymnasium was constructed in 1980 for $900,000. Renovations to the whole building took place from May 1994 to September 1995 for $2 million. A maintenance project in 2006 added a strength and conditioning room, as well as a bus barn to the school, for $1 million. In June 2014, Western Christian received grants from the Minnesota Twins Major League Baseball team and the Modern Woodmen of America for renovations to their baseball and softball fields. New classrooms were added to the building in 2015. The next year, air conditioning was installed and the student commons remolded. The football and track facilities at A. R.

The knowledge required for certification includes an understanding of styles, brewing, ingredients, history of beer and brewing, glassware, beer service, draught systems, beer tasting, and food pairings. The profession is relatively new but growing. Description The work of a beer sommelier is varied due to its infancy and the broadness of the beer and brewing industry. Typically people who qualify through one of the accreditation schemes, work in the hospitality industry and will have responsibility for choosing and purchasing beer, oversee its correct storage and service, attend customers and educate staff. In the brewing industry, beer sommeliers may take tours and tastings as well as be sales representatives. In the retail industry, they may be in charge of the buying and selection of beers available for purchase. Self-employed beer sommeliers may undertake a range of jobs including pub and restaurant consulting and staff training, beer writing, hosting tasting events and beer judging for competitions at festivals, as well as in print for beer reviews. There are a number of private organisations that offer courses and certification for individuals as a beer sommelier, not always using this term, but one of their own creation. One of the largest certifications is the \\"Cicerone\\" program, which is a registered trademark of the Craft Beer Institute. However, the term has seen usage in a generic sense as well.https://www.cicerone.org/us-en/what-is-a-cicerone Beer tasting Beer tasting is the act of assessing the flavor and quality of beer via the subjective process of sampling the beer.

She was the author When We Were Colored: A Mother‚Äôs Story and, No Crystal Stair and is the winner of the 2000 Golden Pen Award for Lifetime Achievement. Early life Born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1917, Rutland is the granddaughter of a former slave who sent all of his children through college. Rutland‚Äôs mother was a school teacher; her father a pharmacist. She attended segregated schools her entire life and graduated from Spelman College in 1937. She married Bill Rutland, a civilian with the Tuskegee Airmen. The Air Force moved Bill Rutland to Ohio, then Sacramento, California. He and Eva built a home, made new friends and raised four children.NPR.Org Author Eva Rutland published her first memoir in 1964 (The Trouble With Being Mama: A Negro Mother on the Anxieties and Joys of Bringing Up a Family). The book, updated and republished in 2007 as When We Were Colored: A Mother‚Äôs Story, chronicles the lives of an ordinary yet extraordinary \\"colored\\" family as they move from segregation to integration during the turbulent civil rights era of the 1950s and 60s. In the 1950s, Rutland realized that she was going blind. \\"When you get incapacitated, and you can't see or can't move around as you should, then you're kind of at a loss,\\" she says. \\"So you have to find something to do, and I think that's when I found my writing.\\" Rutland already sold writing to Redbook and other magazines. In 1964, she published a family memoir as a kind of antidote to the public fear about change and race ‚Äî issues she was intimately familiar with as her own children attended newly integrated schools. In the book, The Trouble With Being a Mama, she wrote, \\"Integration in theory is a fine, high-sounding utopia. In reality, I shivered as I watched my children unknowingly shed the warm cloak of segregation.\\" She had been blind from macular degeneration throughout most of her career. Her first published romance was the Inspirational title A Report of Love in 1985. As an author for Harlequin Romance, Eva Rutland has published 18 books. Including other genres, Rutland has published more than 20 books.The Romance Reader Interviews Eva Rutland No Crystal Stair, Eva Rutland's first mainstream novel, chronicles six decades of American history through the experiences of Ann Elizabeth Carter Metcalf and her family. Rutland's semiautobiographical novel takes its title from a stanza in Langston Hughes' 1922 poem \\"Mother to Son.\\" Both the poem and the novel carry messages of hope and perseverance in the face of life's disappointments. The book is a departure from Rutland's earlier works. The author, who occasionally includes African-American characters in her novels, has taken a frank, head-on look at racism. In addition, her use of language may surprise many familiar with her work.No Crystal Stair Rutland died in Sacramento, California on March 12, 2012 at the age of 95.

L'Estaque, Melting Snow is a c. 1871 oil-on-canvas painting by French Post-Impressionist artist Paul C√©zanne. It shows a view from the outskirts of L'Estaque, a small village near Marseille, with a steep hillside covered in a drift of melting snow underneath a foreboding dark grey sky.Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, 111 Filled with intense emotion, the painting has been described as similar to the work of Vincent van Gogh the following decade, and a painting more formally similar to early 20th-century than contemporaneous art.Schapiro, 54 L'Estaque, Melting Snow was painted in a single session. It is one of only two snow-laden winter subjects C√©zanne painted. C√©zanne moved to Provence in 1870 to evade military service during the Franco-Prussian War. He soon moved to L'Estaque, where he painted a number of landscapes.Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, 216 Critics differ in their interpretation of this painting, some see it as wholly personal, other as a response to the war with Prussia. Supporting the latter view, Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka saw the painting as making a statement on social and political transformation and wrote of the political context in which it was created, \\"what is our response to those red-roofed houses which are held, as if in a vice, between a leaden sky and a sliding block of snow?\\"Tymieniecka, 148 The colors are oppressively dark, while the thickly painted, quick brushwork adds to the urgent violence of the scene. With the exception of the red rooftops and the greens of the trees in the foreground, the colors and the tones are monotonous and gloomy. The whites, greys and blacks are used mostly for emotional impact. Though L'Estaque, Melting Snow evidences C√©zanne's new-found facility in depicting the deep space of a landscape, it is marked by an emotional intensity closer in spirit to the turbulence of his early figure works than to the structural complexity of the later landscape paintings.Adriani, 63 The diagonal of the hill cuts across the painting from left to right, dividing avalanche on one side and gloom on the other. The hill sweeps down until it rests just above the red roof of a barely visible house at its foot‚Äîan effect that art critic Meyer Schapiro described as giving \\"a rushing force to the image.\\" The dark brown trees on the slope's ledge have twisted trunks and rest on unsteady ground, while the trees in the mid-ground are painted in black and form a descending arch which moves inwards towards the center of the canvas before merging with the ominous overhanging clouds. Given the angle of the hill and the depth from which the houses are viewed, it is difficult to imagine where the observer is supposed to be positioned. Writer Ronald Berman drew comparison between C√©zanne's treatment of this landscape and the way Ernest Hemingway imbues the Irati River in Navarre with emotional scope in his 1926 novel on the lost generation, The Sun Also Rises. In both, the landscape is subjective and the viewpoint of the observer is paramount‚Äîthe landscape is representational and perceived differently by each character. According to Berman, \\"The foreground is the observer's space\\". In the C√©zanne, nature becomes an extension of the observer's mental landscape, and in Hemingway it is a representation of each viewer's need for inclusion within the natural order.Berman, Ronald. \\"Translating Modernism: Fitzgerald and Hemingway\\".

The collection contains five epic poems: namely, Asadi Tusi's Garshasp-nama, Ahmad Tabrizi's ≈†ƒÅhan≈°ƒÅh-nƒÅma, TƒÅri·∏µ-e ƒåangiz ·∏¥ƒÅn va JƒÅne≈°inƒÅna≈° (\\"The History of Genghis Khan and his Successors\\") the Bahman-nama, and the Kush-nama. It is likely that a prose version of the work existed during the same time. This manuscript has 10,129 couplets and contains some scribal errors. The work contains some headings, but for ease of analysis it is divided into an introduction and two parts. In Part I, the reader encounters Ku≈° with his hideous face and deceptions. The introduction (lines 1-226) begins by the customary tradition of extolling God. Subsequently, the author then references the Bahman-nama as his previous work. Then he gives the reasons behind their composition, and ends with praise of the patron. The story deals with the eventful life of Kush the Tusked (or Persian: Pil-gush, \\"The Elephant-eared\\"), the son of Kush who is the brother of the king Zahak. Kush the Tusked is said to have lived 1,500 years. The epic poem is dedicated to the Seljuk Sultan, Malek-≈†ƒÅh (r. 498‚Äî511/1105-18). The writer's name does not appear in the work. Story The work encompasses events that take place during the reigns of the mythical kings of Iran, Zahhak and Faridun. In a section at the beginning, the story deals with the heroism, triumphs, deceit and philandering of the character Kush the Tusked. The claim of Kush the Tusked being divine is also recounted in the story. The tale starts with the dragon-fiend king Zahhak who was on the verge of slaying Jamshid. Zahhak predicts that a person from Jamshid's royal line shall avenge his death. In order to circumvent this prediction, Zahhak sends his brother Kush to ƒåin (parts of China and Central Asia in Persian mythology) to get rid of Jamshid's off-springs. These off-springs have in their possession, the chronicle called the Andarz-e Jamshid (\\"Jamshid's Testament\\"), a book that foretells events in the family's future and counsels them on what to do when they do. Based on the advice of this book, Jamshid's descendants remain hidden, roaming the forests and stay away from the reach of Kush. While looking for Jamshid's descendants, Kush stumbles upon the Pilgu≈° (literally, the \\"elephant-eared\\") Tribe. He battles this tribe and takes a woman from the tribe as his bride. The woman bears him an elephant-eared and tusked son. But when Kush sees the hideous like face of his son, he flies into an angry range. He kills his wife for giving birth to such a demonic creature. Subsequently, he abandons his son in the forest that was the hiding place of the house of Jamshid. During this time, Abtin (pronounced as ƒÄbtin), the third generation of Jamshid's line (Jam≈°id > Nunak > MahƒÅru > ƒÄbtin) appears in the story. Abtin's wife provides shelter to the tusked and elephant-eared son of Kush and he is raised in Abtin's family. The child shows extraordinary examples of physical fighting and he fights for a while against his father Kush in Abtin's army. However, once Kush and his son recognize each other, they join forces against Abtin. Abin's clan who is now under attack from both Kush and his son consults the chronicle of Jamshid. The chronicle advises that whenever he finds himself in trouble, he should seek refuge with the king of MƒÅchin (inner China in Persian literature). MƒÅchin itself has two section: one which borders ƒåin and is ruled by a king named Bahak; the other is island which a month's journey and ruled by the King Teyhur. Abtin is warmly received by Teyhur and he stays in the island which is referenced as BasilƒÅ, Kuh and Jazira in the book. Abtin also marries the daughter of Teyhur who is named daughter FarƒÅrang. During his stay in the island, Abtin is inspired by a dream which tells him to go to Iran. This episode illustrates the overall recurring importance of dreams in the epic. With Teyhur's approval, Abtin and FarƒÅrang aided by an ancient mariner sail for fourteen months and reach the sea of Gilan and Amol (probably meant the Caspian Sea). In Iran, FarƒÅrang gives birth to the Iranian hero Faridun. When the child reaches the age of four, his father, inspired by a dream, entrusts Faridun to a person by the name of salkat, the commander of a fortress in Damavand which Zahak has not been able to capture. Agents of Zahak then capture Abtin and put him to death. When, Kush the Tusked comes to know about Abtin's refuge to the island of Jazira, his marriage to FarƒÅrang, and his return to Iran, he sets up plans to take over the island. Despite the fact that island ruled by Teyhur has not been conquered for 3000 years, he craftily takes it over. Afterwards, he actually destroys the whole island. At this time, news of Zahhak's capture at the hand of Faridun reaches Kush and Kush returns to ƒåin. Fereydun, shackles Zahhak's hand and foot, and puts a yoke around his neck, imprisoning him the mount Damavand. After vanquishing Zahhak, Fereydun decides to put an end to Kush the Tusked' tyranny in Chin. Fereydun sends an army to Chin to defeat Kush and capture him, but the army is rerouted. Meanwhile, Kush builds a city by the name of Kushan in the lands beyond the Oxus. Kush decrees that a statue of himself be erected in the city, and he forces the inhabitants to worship it. Fereydun, eventually sends KƒÅran/QƒÅran (c.f. with the Parthian house of Karen) to the land of Chin with a vast army. Fereydun's army is victorious and QƒÅran captures Kush in hand-to-hand combat. Kush is sent back to Iran, and he is imprisoned beside Zahhak, in Damavand. Kush is imprisoned for forty years until Armies from Abyssinia and Nubia (called Mazandaran by the author and should not be confused with the province of Mazandaran in Iran) attack north Africa and advance as Egypt. At this time, the inhabitants of the area seek the help of Fereydun. Fereydun sends his Iranian troops there, to defeat the armies from the south. But once those troops leave, the armies from south return and attack the inhabitants of North Africa and Egypt. In a meeting of Faridun with his advisors, they came to a consensus that they must send a harsh tyrant to the West. The unanimous choice is Kush, who is unshackled and brought before Faridun. Kush seeks forgiveness from Fereydun, and swears to be a loyal servant of the King of Iran. A proclamation to which the gentry bears witness is written, so that the pact may be honored. Kush is then sent as the head of the army to Egypt and North Africa. He defeats the enemy and the spoils are sent back to Faridun. Kush also founds several new cities in the region. However, Kush breaks his pledge to Faridun and openly rebels against him. He kills the Iranian members of his army, and orders each home to have an effigy of him and that it be worshipped daily. In order to subdue Kush, Faridun sends his son Salm to vanquish Kush. Salm defeats Kush's army, but Kush flees to the West. During this time, the three sons of Faridun, Tur, Iraj and Salm were openly fighting. Iraj demands tribute from his two other brothers, and they on the other hand align with Kush. Together, the brothers kill Iraj and they divide the world with Kush, and take some territory from Faridun. However, Manuchehr the son of Iraj seeks vengeance for his father and with a large army goes to battle against Tur, Salm and Kush. Manuchehr with a large army goes into battle against the two sons and Ku≈°. Tur and Salm are killed in battle, and Manuchehr wounds Kush with his bull-headed mace. The wounded Kush was able to escape to KhwƒÅvarƒÅn (the East), and gain control of the region. Kush became very powerful again and had collected a formidable army. He rules these lands for a long time. During this era of the story, the armies from Abyssinia and Nubia attack once again. Kush goes to battle against these armies but he has no success. During this era, Kaykavus now is the king of Iran. Kush convinces the Iranian ruler to go to war, however the combined forces of Kush and the Iranian armies is not enough to defeat the armies of Abyssinia and Nubia. However, the great legendary hero Rustam is sent to the area and defeats the armies of Abyssinia and Nubia. This part of the epic is very close to Ferdowsi's version of Rustam's mission to Mazandaran (Abyssinia and Nubia). Despite several setbacks, Kush remains determined on his religious aspirations and his proclamation of divinity. During a hunting expedition, he becomes separated from his crew and loses his way. On the way, he stops at a house. The wise lord of the palace, who is a pious man, invites him and asks him, what is his name. Kush replies that: \\"I am God, the Giver of Daily Bread and Guide\\"!. The owner finds the idea laughable and Kush eventually abandons his claim to divinity. In return, the owner, who was also an expert pgysician performs surgery on his so that the face of Kush is restored to human form. The owner wins Kush over to the cause of God, and Kush spents 46 years with learning a variety of disciplines. The wise lord then convinces Kush to return to his homeland. Kush returns to his homeland and encourages everyone to worship God. The story ends by the fact that the wise lord was a descendant of Jamshid, and he was giving the story of Ku≈°-e Pil-DandƒÅn to Alexander.

Location Dyfnant Forest lies to the west of the B4395 road, a road which stems north from the A458 road and is between the valleys of the Afon Twrch to the west and the Afon Efyrnwy to the east, north of the village of Llangadfan. It is described by Lonely Planet as being \\"where a well-signposted maze of forestry tracks culminates in one enormous hill before descending rather spectacularly toward Lake Vyrnwy\\" (five miles away). Dyfnant Forest has an area of located at the periphery of the Cambrian Mountains, just south of Lake Vyrnwy. Geography The original forest was planted by the Forestry Commission. It is approached from a country road from Llangadfan, which branches into a foot track. It is well served by of forest tracks. The forest tracks include the Rainbow Trails, which were established by a partnership between Forestry Commission Wales and the Dyfnant and Fyrnwy Horse Riders' & Carriage Drivers' Association; set in peaceful forest environment the trails consist of five horse-riding trails. Wildlife The forest is a large working forest, of predominately coniferous trees with pockets of native deciduous trees. The forest has rich growth of mixed plantation comprising conifers such as cypress, western red cedar, lodgepole pine, Douglas fir, Norway spruce and grand fir, as well as from deciduous trees. Within the forest, Dyfnant Meadows spread over a small area of , which is mainly an open land. This grassland continues to be used as a hill pasture for sheep and cattle. Apart from the grassland, the flora includes oxeye daisy and eye-bright, and in bog areas lady's smock, lousewort, rush and meadowsweet; wet areas have sedge and rush; wooded areas comprise sessile oak, moss, lichen and fern. Notable bird species in the forest include goshawk, crossbills and black grouse in particular. The goshawk has appeared increasingly since the 1980s. Other developments A wind farm to produce 80‚Äì120 megawatts of power has been proposed in the Dyfnant Forest provoking local controversy due to its incompatibility with the development of the trails for riding, carriage driving etc. Severn Trent Water Company has the responsibility of managing the forest, interacting with the Countryside Council for Wales and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and the task of preserving these forests along with the Vyrnwy estate, as a national nature reserve. A particular stretch of the trail in the forest is identified (by the Forestry Commission for Welsh Assembly Government) as an encouraging place (for children visiting the area to identify 10 species) to look for wildlife species such as squirrel, frog, stoat and owl amidst rich foliage of several tree species.

At every generation (a point of discrete time), a branching random walk's value is a set of elements that are located in some linear space, such as the real line. Each element of a given generation can have several descendants in the next generation. The location of any descendant is the sum of its parent's location and a random variable. Example An example of branching random walk can be constructed where the branching process generates exactly two descendants for each element, a binary branching random walk. Given the initial condition that Xœµ = 0, we suppose that X1 and X2 are the two children of Xœµ. Further, we suppose that they are independent (0, 1) random variables. Consequently, in generation 2, the random variables X1,1 and X1,2 are each the sum of X1 and a (0, 1) random variable. In the next generation, the random variables X1,2,1 and X1,2,2 are each the sum of X1,2 and a (0, 1) random variable. The same construction produces the values at successive times.

It is not to be confused with H.O.L.A., Helping Outstanding Latinos Achieve, a program winning numerous awards and grants and created in 2012 by Katelyn and Madison Singh; although both advocate for the success of Latino populations. HOLA's Directory of Talent was created in 1981 and was the first directory to feature solely Latino talent. Currently, the online HOLA Talent Directory is the internet‚Äôs only concentrated pool of Latino acting talent. The Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors (HOLA) is the United States‚Äô longest running, active arts service and advocacy organization dedicated to expanding the presence of Hispanic artists in entertainment and media through the cultivation, education and recognition of emerging Latino artists. HOLA strives for an accurate, informed and non-stereotyped portrayal of the full spectrum of Latino culture and heritage in all entertainment and media industries. Previous and current HOLA members include Fortuna Calvo-Roth, Carlos Carrasco (at one time the Executive Director), M√≠riam Col√≥n, Liza Col√≥n-Zayas, Delilah Cotto, Ra√∫l D√°vila (at one time its President), Caridad de la Luz, Robin de Jes√∫s, Idalis DeLe√≥n, Emilio Delgado, Venuz Delmar,Mois√©s Kaufman, Malcolm March,Ana Margarita Mart√≠nez- Casado, Jorge Merced, Olga Merediz, Antone Pag√°n, Ilka Tanya Pay√°n, Antonia Rey, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Jaime S√°nchez, Roselyn S√°nchez, Jimmy Smits, Miguel √Ångel Su√°rez, Judy Torres and David Zayas. History Manolo Garcia-Oliva, president of HOLA, right, with awardees Benicio del Toro, center, and Artur Balder, left, during a ceremony. HOLA was founded in 1975 by a group of Hispanic actors (including founding president Ilka Tanya Pay√°n and founding members Elizabeth Pe√±a and Ra√∫l Juli√°) concerned with the images of Latinos in the media. The organization still functions as the nation‚Äôs leading advocacy group in the entertainment industry for actors working on stage, on television and in film. In one well-documented case in the 1990s, HOLA successfully collaborated with Actors‚Äô Equity Association to shine a light on questionable casting practices being employed at the time on Broadway. The show in question then was the Ariel Dorfman play Death and the Maiden. Since that time the number of Latinos on Broadway has increased steadily over the years. HOLA was originally located in the west 40s in Manhattan. It later moved to the Lincoln Square Neighborhood Center in the West Side of Manhattan in the shadow of Lincoln Center. Since 2001, HOLA has been located in the Clemente Soto V√©lez Cultural and Educational Center in the Loisaida section of Manhattan. Activities HOLA works within the entertainment industry to ensure that the Hispanic community has equal access to jobs while also functioning as a safe haven where Hispanic performers, writers and directors can share ideas, concerns and thoughts about the industry. Today, HOLA continues to provide essential services to professional actors. While show business has changed through the years, HOLA‚Äôs mission has remained the same. By expanding job opportunities for Hispanic actors, HOLA strengthens and supports the available talent pool for industry professionals seeking Latino acting talent. HOLA Awards Early in its history, the organization instituted an excellence in artistic achievement awards program (then called the H.O.L.A. Awards) that were held in the 1970s before being suspended. The HOLA Awards were held once again in 1999 and are currently held yearly.

He represented Inverness County in the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia from 1847 to 1867 as a Reformer and then as a Conservative. He was born in Dublin and came to Nova Scotia in 1817. He was married twice: first to Mary O'Grady in 1830 and then to Ellen Keating. Smyth was a fish and cattle merchant, owned at least two stores and also dealt in land. He served as a school board commissioner, road commissioner, justice of the peace and as custos rotulorum for Inverness County. Originally a Liberal, Smyth crossed the floor in 1857 to become a Conservative. He was a member of the Legislative Council of Nova Scotia from 1867 until his death in Port Hood in 1879. A devoted Roman Catholic, Smyth donated a portion of his estate to the Diocese of Antigonish. His daughter Elizabeth married Duncan J. Campbell.The Canadian parliamentary companion, HJ Morgan (1874) DESCRIPTION OF HISTORIC PLACE The Peter Smyth House stands prominently on raised ground in the north end of Port Hood, commanding an unrestricted view of Port Hood Harbour and two off-shore islands. Its front elevation is one-and-a-half storeys with two-and-a-half storeys at the rear. Built in the mid-1850s, its front fa√ßade has a central front entrance with two windows on either side and a Scottish dormer above. It is the only house in Inverness County built of dressed stone ashlar masonry. Municipal designation covers both the building and surrounding property. HERITAGE VALUE The Peter Smyth House is valued as the finest example of a Georgian stone residence in Inverness County and is one of only three stone houses remaining in the county. Built for prominent merchant Peter Smyth, the stone is believed to have been quarried locally in the district of Port Hood. In true Georgian style, it has a raised first floor level entrance with a fanlight and sidelights with original stone stairs ascending to it. While one-and-a-half storeys at the front, at the rear there are a full two-and-a-half storeys. The lower level of the house, (partly below ground level on the front), contains a kitchen with original fireplace, pantry, storage and bedroom. It may be the only surviving house in Inverness County with servants quarters. The Peter Smyth House is also valued as the home of one of the most prominent Inverness County merchants and politicians of the nineteenth century - Peter Smyth. Born in Dublin, Ireland circa 1800, Peter Smyth came to Port Hood in 1830 and established himself as a fish and cattle merchant. He was heavily involved in the shipping trade and owned at least two stores for both retail and wholesale businesses. He also dealt extensively in land. After a period as a Justice of the Peace for Inverness County, he was elected to the Provincial House of Assembly in Halifax and served Inverness County in various sessions from 1847 to 1863. In 1867, he was appointed to the Legislative Council, a position which he held until his death in 1879. He also served as Custos Rotulorum (Chief Magistrate) and as commissioner for the school board and for roads. Peter Smyth is remembered as a strong supporter of the Roman Catholic Church in the Diocese of Arichat (later the Diocese of Antigonish, 1886). When he died in 1879, he was reputed to be the wealthiest man on Cape Breton Island. He made generous bequests towards St. Ninian's Cathedral and St. Francis Xavier College in Antigonish. In Port Hood, he made a major contribution to the construction of the present St. Peter's Catholic Church (1881) and was instrumental in the establishment of a boys and girls public school in Port Hood under the tutelage of the Sisters of Notre Dame of Montreal. His widow, Ellen (Keating) Smyth, was a gracious hostess and when the first two Sisters arrived in 1884, they resided with her in the stone house until their new convent was ready for occupancy. This house was also occupied by two more generations of the Smyth family. It was the official residence of John I. Smyth when he was elected the first mayor of the newly established town of Port Hood in 1903. From the 1920s through to the 1940s, Eleanor Smyth, a granddaughter of Peter Smyth, was a very well known female entrepreneur in Inverness County. She operated an inn at her home called Killarney Manor and an ice cream parlour (in an adjacent building on the property) catering to visiting county councillors, politicians, lawyers, judges, and educators in Port Hood, the Shire Town of Inverness County.

Reckless debuted on the NY Times Bestsellers list the week of May 23, 2010. Reckless is the third in his series with investigator Ty Hauck, hero of The Dark Tide and Don‚Äôt Look Twice. Hauck follows the threads of a brutal murder of a Connecticut family into a conspiracy that directly reflects the state of the world financial markets and the axiom of ‚Äútoo big to fail.‚Äù Setting Reckless is set in circa 2009 Greenwich, Connecticut in the post Madoff era. The story portrays the financial industry in the aftermath of Great Recession and the subprime mortgage crisis. Story Ty Hauck learns of the murder of a close personal friend April Glassman along with her husband Marc and their daughter. The murder was clearly meant to look like one of a recent string of home invasions, but very little about this murder parallels the other home invasions. The murder of Marc Glassman, a trader at a major brokerage, has an immediate and dramatic effect on world financial markets. Coincidentally, Glassman had gone out of his way to violate company policy, having dramatically over leveraged his positions. His murder brings down one of Wall Street's oldest and most respected brokerages. Hauck has started a new job with Talon, a security firm whose largest client is Reynolds Ried, ‚Äúa Wall Street icon.‚Äù Merrill Simons, the ex-wife of Reynolds Rieds' CEO, hires Hauck to check up on her suspicions about her new love interest Dani Thibault. As Hauck investigates Thibault he begins to see clues that connect Thibault to the murder of Marc Glassman and the apparent suicide of James Donovan, another over extended trader from a different firm. In Washington, Treasury agent Naomi Blum watches millions of dollars in suspicious bank transfers. Her research leads her to follow the same trail as Hauck. Hauck and Blum team up to unravel evidence that all connects back to Dani Thibault. Their search takes them to Serbia and leads back to London to find Marty al-Bashir, the chief investment officer of the Royal Saudi Partnership. As witnesses are quickly silenced in a string of murders, the trail leads all the way back to the Secretary of the Treasury in Washington and Peter Simons, the CEO of Reynold's Reid.
