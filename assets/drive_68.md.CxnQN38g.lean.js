The spines may be red, yellow, white, purplish, or bicolored, sometimes with darker tips. The flower is up to 3 centimeters long and has tepals in shades of yellowish, brownish, greenish, or occasionally red, with darker reddish midstripes. The tepals are thin at the tips. The taxonomy of the species is uncertain, with authors recognizing several varieties which are sometimes treated as separate species. One variety, var. davisii (sometimes called Echinocereus davisii), Davis' green pitaya, is federally listed as an endangered species.

The story is also referred to as ‚ÄúLugalbanda in the Wilderness‚Äù or ‚ÄúLugalbanda I‚Äù and followed by the story known as Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird, together forming the two parts of one story. The stories, from the composer‚Äôs point of view, take place in the distant past.

The story of Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave, Old-Babylonian period, from southern Iraq. Sulaymaniyah Museum, Iraqi Kurdistan Synopsis Sumerian king Enmerkar wants to conquer the land of Aratta. Rounding up his army, Enmerkar marches toward Aratta, a city on the eastern highlands. Amongst the soldiers is Lugalbanda, who falls seriously ill and is left by his brothers to live or die in a cave along with some provisions. Lugalbanda lies ill for two days; he prays to the gods Shamash, Inanna, and Nanna to be healed of his sickness and is eventually healed by them. A few days later he captures a wild bull and two wild goats before lying down to dream. He is sent a dream instructing him to sacrifice the animals he has captured and he proceeds to do so. The end of the text is very fragmented and not well understood, but sheds light on the gods who, although they hold great power, exhibit a dark side. Comments In separate Sumerian traditions, specifically in the text referred to as Sumerian King List, Lugalbanda is known as the successor of Enmerkar as the king of Uruk, but in these Lugalbanda stories there is no such indication, and Lugalbanda appears only as one of the soldiers of king Enmerkar. In other accounts Lugalbanda is also known as the father of the mythical hero Gilgamesh, who succeeds Lugalbanda to the throne of Uruk. Among Sumerian literary narratives including the four of Enmerkar-Aratta cycle and five known Gilgamesh stories, ‚ÄúLugalbanda in the Wilderness‚Äù and its continuation ‚ÄúLugalbanda and the Anzu Bird‚Äù are considered to be the most elaborate and complex texts of their period with a combined length of 1000 lines, as well as their complicated symbolism, strong mythological elements, and unpredictable plot that moves back and forth between the mundane and divine worlds.Michalowski, p.15-17. Although earlier generations of scholars have sought behind these stories a historical reality dating back to Early Dynastic Period, such attempts are mostly based on an amalgamation of data from the epic traditions of the 2nd millennium with unclear archaeological observations. Lugalbanda, Reallexikon der Assyriologie 7, p.117. It is argued that even if the earlier oral traditions may have had an influence in the origin of these stories, the texts that have reached us are the highly stylized and literary products of the scribes of the Ur III Period and later, and for such scribes ‚Äúthese texts were about the present, albeit projected into the past; indeed it is this very act of projection that marks them as fiction, not as ethnography or history.‚ÄùMichalowski, p.17 References External links *English translation of the epic, in the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature Mesopotamian myths Sumerian literature ","title":"Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave"},{"id":"31197500","text":"The Academy before 1914 The Saint Petersburg Theological Academy () is a theological seminary in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

He finds the chick of the giant Anzu (or Anzud) bird, which is described as a lion-headed eagle, and decides to feed the chick. When the Anzu bird returns, it is first startled by the chick not responding to its call, but once it finds out what happened, it is very pleased with Lugalbanda and in appreciation grants him the ability to travel at super speeds. With his newly gained super power Lugalbanda catches up with his comrades who are laying siege to the city of Aratta. But his king Enmerkar is facing problems with the siege and after a year of setbacks without success, decides to seek the advice of the goddess Inana who is back in Uruk (in the story referred to as Unug or Kulaba), pleading for her to assist him once more, as she had assisted in building a wall against the encroaching Martu in the 50th year of his reign. Finally Lugalbanda volunteers for the trip. Lugalbanda is able to travel the incredible distance over seven mountain ranges within a day's time.

Kazakhstan's thermal neutron open pool reactor WWR-K was commissioned in 1967. In order to decrease proliferation risks, Kazakhstan started the program to convert WWR-K to LEU. Kazakhstan's Institute of Nuclear Physics developed and implemented comprehensive safety programs for the reactor. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also provided recommendation on how ensure further continuous safety improvements on WWR-K. Nuclear Security Training Kazakhstan first announced to establish a nuclear security training in 2009. The construction began in December 2015 and was completed in February 2017 in Almaty. In May 2017 the authorities of Kazakhstan announced that the Nuclear Security Training would start its operation in June 2017. The center is aimed at providing training and education programs to the scientists specializing in nuclear energy. IAEA Low Enriched Uranium Bank Owned and controlled by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) Bank is a physical reserve of up to 90 metric tons of LEU hosted by Kazakhstan at the Ulba Metallurgical Plant in Oskemen. The LEU Bank is an assurance of supply mechanism of last resort for Member States in case the supply of LEU to a nuclear power plant is disrupted due to exceptional circumstances. The opening ceremony was held on August 29, 2017 in Astana, Kazakhstan. The LEU Bank became operational on October 17, 2019, when it received its shipment of low enriched uranium. 32 cylinders of LEU were delivered from France's Orano Cycle. It is an amount that is typically sufficient for one re-load of fuel for a light-water reactor.

Most of Venezuela's nuclear science activities are carried out at Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research (IVIC). Venezuela does not mine radioactive minerals, but the government estimates that 50 tonnes of unexploited uranium ore are available in the country.  Historical facilities  During the regime of president Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, the RV-1 nuclear reactor at IVIC, was commissioned under the supervision of Humberto Fern√°ndez-Mor√°n. The reactor was purchased from General Electric in 1956 and could produce up to 3 MW of power. The reactor reached criticality in 1960 and was shut down in 1994.  International treaties  Venezuela became a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency in August 1957, and signed the Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1967, under which, the states parties agree to prohibit and prevent the test and creation of nuclear weapons. Venezuela also signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1975 and negotiated IAEA Safeguards Agreements covering all its nuclear activities in March 1982. In 2017, Venezuela signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons of the United Nations. Other deals include a memorandum of understanding with Brazil on cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy of July 1979, followed by a mutual nuclear reactor research project in November 1983. In 2007, an article in newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported that uranium mining technology, developed by the Brazilian National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN) was transferred to Venezuela.  Cancelled projects  In 2010, Venezuela announced plans to build a nuclear power station, with support from Russia. Venezuela signed two pacts with Russia, one for mutual collaboration on nuclear energy and a second on for the purchase and installation of two nuclear reactors: a research reactor to be used for medical and scientific purposes and a nuclear power plant. After the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez announced a halt to plans on building a nuclear power plant. The agreement with Russia included the training of students in Russia to increase specialized personnel. Many Venezuelan students followed postgraduate studies in Russia until the termination of the training program in 2017.

Never constructed by its designer, it was instead built to a scale of 1:1, as shown in the ITN documentary Leonardo's Dream Machines, which was aired for the first time in February 2003 by Channel 4.IMDb, Leonardo's Dream Machines The original idea of Leonardo, as described in the drawings of the Atlantic Codex (1488‚Äì1489), was to build a giant crossbow in order to increase the range of the dart. It was used to fire rocks and bombs, it was mostly intimidation based. The bow was made up of thin wood, on 6 wheels, 27 yards across, and made up of 39 separate parts. The creation of the design is linked to Ludovico Sforza, an Italian prince in the Renaissance era, who wanted to expand and advance both his military and the Milan region. To do so, he wanted to update the current treatise on military engineering by Roberto Valturio. Leonardo responded by writing Sforza a letter that included a number of innovative machine designs, one of which was the crossbow. Leonardo also highlighted in the letter his expertise in engineering, most likely having known that Sforza was wanting to hire military engineers at the time. While there is no exact date for the illustration of Leonardo's crossbow, it is generally believed that it was completed between 1483 and the early 1490s. Many scholars generally agree that Leonardo completed the drawing in Milan, but there is debate as to why he came there. Some believe he came to Milan in search of work as a painter and then he got news of Sforza's military desires upon arriving; others suggest that the initial reason he came to Milan was to work for Sforza. While some believe that Leonardo designed the crossbow for his own amusement, the context around this design suggests the crossbow was intended to be a dangerous weapon that would greatly appeal to his employer: Ludovico Sforza. Inspiration for such a weapon most likely stemmed from the fact that Leonardo grew up in Italy during the 15th century, which means he was a witness to the constant warfare between the many city-states in his area. Thus, Leonardo put extensive time and effort into designs that could both protect his fellow citizens and greatly harm the enemy. The crossbow supports this theory in that the intended enormous size of the weapon was meant to invoke fear and panic in its enemies to keep them away, but it would still have the capability to cause great damage and injury had it been constructed. The crossbow had been around long before Leonardo's design, but his design made the weapon more advanced, which is why Leonardo's crossbow stands out as significant. If a crossbow is designed with a narrower shaft and a tapered bolt, which adjusts the nocking of arrows, it greatly improves the airflow of the bow and the drag on arrows; this allows the crossbow to operate much more efficiently and have a more precise aim. These ideas were present in Leonardo's design and originated with Leonardo alone. The mathematics that Leonardo utilized to construct his crossbow design were far advanced despite having some now known inaccuracies with today's current knowledge of geometrics and design. Nonetheless, Leonardo was \\"the first modern engineer to attempt to apply the geometrical mathematics of the laws of motion to the design of machines.\\" The other mathematical marvel that is noted in Leonardo's design of the crossbow is the proportional techniques that he utilized in every aspect of the design.

The band consists of vocalist and guitarist Moises Cruz, vocalist and bass guitarist Joshua Cruz, and drummer Ricky James Acosta. With original lead guitarist Alex Sayes, the band achieved moderate success after releasing their debut album From the Garage to Your Speakers. Formation (2006‚Äì2007) Moises Cruz, Joshua Cruz and Ricky James Acosta grew up together on the same street and in 2006, after each of their previous bands split, they formed their own band. Due to prior engagements, Ricky James Acosta was forced to leave the band in early 2007. Not wanting to leave the band without a drummer, he introduced to the band his friend, and fellow drummer, Rene Haro. Rene Haro appeared during rehearsals and was hired soon after. The band also hired Alex Sayes to play lead guitar. Early albums and moderate success (2008) The band recorded various demos and filmed a music video for their single \\"Cheating Bch\\". The publicity eventually allowed the band to play many different Los Angeles venues, including The Whiskey A Go Go, The Roxy Theater, The El Rey Theatre, The Troubadour and other various bars and clubs on the Sunset Strip. In early 2008, the band began writing music for their first, full-length EP, which would eventually become From The Garage to Your Speakers. During the writing process, Joshua Cruz contacted Tomas Costanza, producer, vocalist and guitarist for the band Diffuser, to discuss the possibility of working with the band on the record. After reviewing the band's demos, Tomas Costanza agreed to produce the record. TV show, record release and line-up changes (2008‚Äì2009) While producing Cold Forty Three‚Äôs first record, the band was approached by television network FUSE, to be featured in a series called Rock Bottom. The show focused on former drummer Rene Haro's habitual marijuana use and the internal band conflicts that it caused. Meanwhile the band's lead guitarist, Alex Sayes, left the band permanently due to personal issues and an arrest. While filming for the reality television show, the band signed with Chamberlain Records and finished recording their debut record, From the Garage to Your Speakers. The band released the record on October 11, 2008, the same day Fuse aired Rock Bottom, featuring Cold Forty Three. After the episode was debuted, reviews were well received by fans and critics alike. Through 2009, the remaining members of the band toured the US extensively in support of the new record. Rene Haro's substance abuse continued, as well as his desire to leave the band because of a girl he met on-line, leaving him unable to perform during shows, which forced the band to ask him to leave in July 2009. Ricky James Acosta was tapped by the band to re-join and they continued on with their tour. Continued touring, new record and Warped Tour announcement (2009‚Äì2012) Not wanting to lose the momentum gained from touring, the band decided to follow Blink-182's 2009 reunion tour, as well as, the 2010 Vans Warped Tour. Both of these decisions gained the band veneration with both camps, with the latter allowing the band to play four dates on the Kevin Says stage as well as the Ernie Ball Stage. The opportunity to play at the 2010 Vans Warped Tour, as well as the hard work that they put in behind the scenes prompted Kevin Lyman to invite the band back to play the 2011 Vans Warped Tour. The band also began writing music for their second full-length record while on the road. Recording began in October 2010 and it wrapped up in December 2010. Around that time, the band tapped long-time friend and fellow musician Matthew ‚ÄúMachete‚Äù Flores to act as their touring lead guitarist on their upcoming 2011 US tour. On March 9, 2011, Cold Forty Three was officially announced on the 2011 Vans Warped Tour website. CFT completed the 2011 Vans Warped tour and took a much needed break. In November 2011 they announced that Flores would no longer be touring with the band, and the said that they would be looking for a replacement guitarist. They were scheduled for the \\"End Of The World\\" headlining tour that will take them throughout the U.S. and a few dates in Canada, with 200 West from Los Angeles, and Last Chance Casanova, from Joplin Missouri. CFT was in the studio working on an EP they hoped would be released before the summer of 2012. CFT was officially announced to perform on the 2012 Vans Warped Tour for the entire summer on February 29, 2012. Also the band announced that Johnny Young of the band Hookah Stew would be joining them on tour in 2012. He rejoined Hookahstew after the summer. Launch Party album (2012‚Äì2013) The band stated that they would be releasing an album in December 2012, but their touring schedule did not allow them to achieve this. The band performed two new songs during the summer on the 2012 Vans Warped Tour, that most likely will be included on the Launch Party album. The songs were called \\"never thought we'd make it\\" and \\"STYX\\", with the latter being released on limited-edition download cards, that were included when fans purchased merchandise during the Warped Tour. The reception to \\"STYX\\" was a positive one, with the band displaying a much more \\"hardcore\\" edge, as Joshua Cruz screams his way through the bridge. \\"I never knew how to scream, or even tried it. I just kinda....went for it...I suppose. I have a lot to work on, to get to the level of some real screamers, like Austin Carlile, or guys like that.\\" The band is currently unsigned as their deal with Chamberlain Records expired, with the band saying that \\"we don't need a label to get our music out there. We have plenty of people listening and we have enough experience, that we can just start our own label and release things ourselves\\" Moses was quoted as saying. \\"But if the right deal comes up, then we'll entertain the idea as long as it makes sense for all parties involved\\". Currently the band is planning on using their time off on working on the album, and finding a producer who is the \\"best fit\\" for the band. Ricky James was quoted, \\"if it takes all year, we'll work on the record all year. We don't want to just put something out, if we're not gonna be happy with it. So, expect us to kinda take our time with it.\\" In August 2013, filming for \\"Hundred Dollar Bail\\" began and was expected to be released before the holidays. There were also rumors of CFT signing a new deal with another indie label.

As envisaged by Alberto, the path toward developing a Brazilian nuclear sector included the nationalization of nuclear activities and specific compensations for exporting strategic raw materials. Accordingly, Brazil attempted to negotiate trade agreements that, in exchange for Brazilian raw materials, would include provisions to grant easier access to sensitive technologies and training for Brazilian nuclear engineers.

Findley's Washington Post article argued that \\"a bilateral, on-site, nuclear verification agreement between Argentina and Brazil could help to arrest mounting suspicion over the ultimate nuclear aspirations of these two important states.\\" The congressman first advocated for the common rejection of PNEs, followed by the \\"continuing, mutual, on-site monitoring of their respective nuclear facilities.\\" Findley did not consider a bilateral arrangement as a substitute for the IAEA verification regime, but as an \\"additional element of assurance and protection between two states whose past relations have at time been quite troubled.\\" While Findley's proposal seemed to be welcomed in Argentina, it did not resonate well with the Brazilian government. At the time, Brazilian diplomat Luiz Felipe Lampreia stated that Brazil was part of multilateral safeguards structures, which he argued was the right path to enhance nuclear security. Lampreia also added that, since Findley's proposal was not endorsed by the U.S. government, there was no need for Brazil to issue a formal response.\\"Brasil n√£o far√° acordo nuclear com a Argentina\\", Folha de S.

He was born on 29 August 1941 in Workington, Cumberland where he also grew up. In 1962 he gained his BA in Geography and History at University College London (UCL), and later in 1964 an MA in Architecture and Town Planning from Liverpool University. He became a research Fellow in Tibetan at SOAS in 1965 and became Lecturer in Tibetan in 1973. Denwood describes his interest in Himalayan cultures as purely accidental. Having completed his study at Liverpool and based in England, Denwood was living next door to a friend of his from college David Snellgrove. Snellgrove had not long returned from a trip to the Himalayas and had brought five Tibetan refugees back with him around the time of the first wave of exiles post 1959. Denwood's intrigue about the situation with his friend's house guests, coupled with his interest in oriental architecture inspired him to join Snellgrove on an overland trip to India he had been planning. They drove a landrover to Nepal together, (which they later sold to a Bhutanese army officer,) and Denwood stayed there learning Tibetan while Snellgrove went ahead to South India. When Snellgrove returned to Nepal, Denwood joined him once again and they drove to Bhutan. The trip lasted a year in total and learning the Tibetan language had prompted Denwood's interest in linguistics. When he returned to England, Denwood landed the training post of Research Fellow of Tibetan at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (SOAS), where he was eventually appointed as a lecturer.http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staff30854.php During his time learning Tibetan in Nepal, Denwood had observed the lack of material available for learning the language, and found the native approach to teaching too unscientific. His budding interest in linguistics brought about his own analysis of the language, learning also from Richard Keith Sprigg who at the time was teaching in the SOAS Linguistics department. This study culminated in the writing of his own book of Tibetan grammar, titled; 'Tibetan'. Denwood's interest in Tibetan handicrafts he again describes as accidental. The SOAS library had sent him to Delhi, India on a placement for 6 months. He traveled with his wife and two young children. Having been introduced to the Tibetan community there he became familiar with the carpet trade. It was his wife who decided to learn how to weave a carpet, whilst Denwood wrote a book about the process. Denwood retired from teaching at SOAS in 2006.

To better serve the increasing commuting public on the Crame-Quiapo line, G.Liner petitioned for authority to divert eight of its twenty eight(28) units operating on the line Little-Baguio-Quiapo via P. Guevarra. On the proposed modification of route, the eight(8) autotrucks shall pass Santolan road, P Guevarra, P. Casal, P. Concepcion, Arrocerros to Quiapo. This Petition was granted March 15, 1963.

After Martial Law, The Company suffered great setbacks due to increase in fuel cost of gasoline, without commensurate increase in fare. So the company decided to dispose gasoline fueled buses. In 1978, the company started to purchase diesel-fueled brand new Mitsubishi buses until it reached 40 units in the year 1983. The number of units were increased in 1985 when it purchased second hand Mitsubishi Fuso buses, bringing its total 54 units. In the line with the company's expansion. 1988 saw 10 brand new Hino buses and 3 second hand Mitsubishi Fuso buses added to its fleet. Again in 1989, 15 brand new Nissan units were acquired through the Bus Installment Purchase Plan (BIPP 1).

Early contact The earliest Greeks came to Hawaii after Captain James Cook, including some with Captain George Vancouver‚Äôs expedition. Subsequently, in the 1830s Greeks came as whalers and traders. The Russian Orthodox Church was established in 1839 which Greek Orthodox Christians attended. Hiram Bingham I of the ABCFM held a certain degree of approval that the Greeks were at the minimum Christians, but the missionary community would learn to loathe the Greeks. In 1850 princes Alexander Liholiho and Lot KapuƒÅiwa met Greek Minister Spyridon Trikoupis in Paris who encouraged them to join him in drinking and gambling, against Gerrit Judd‚Äôs objections. Later establishment In the 1870s Greeks began to emigrate because of famine and over-population in Greece for labor on Hawaii‚Äôs sugarcane plantations. A few entrepreneurial Greeks who came to Hawaii in the 1880s formed a tight community and gave jobs to fellow countrymen at their businesses. The ABCFM missionaries had since become a group of wealthy elite and the disdain for the Greeks had increased. William Alexander described Greeks as ‚Äúcommercial, ingenious and eloquent, but deceitful, dirty and immoral.‚Äù Among the immigrants was Peter Camarinos, who joined as co-partner of Campbell, Marshall, and Company. Camarinos was sued by A. J. Campbell for $6,750. Paul Neumann defended Camarinos and had the suit dismissed. This was followed up by two countersuits. After the suit the new Greeks of the community avoided the missionaries and instead acquainted themselves with the monarchs. The Greeks came to compete against the missionaries in the export and pineapple industries. Further disapproval by the conservative missionaries was caused by the Greeks' tendency to attend and hold parties which included King David KalƒÅkaua. An additional source of disapproval was the hospitality industry, which provided drinking, music, and partying. Overthrow of the Kingdom As the missionaries turned to aggression the political situation became increasingly unfavorable to the Greeks. On June 30, 1887 the a missionary group called the Hawaiian League forced the bayonet constitution on King KalƒÅkaua. In 1891 King KalƒÅkaua died and his sister, Queen Lili ªuokalani, ascended the throne. On January 17, 1893 Queen Lili ªuokalani was overthrown by businessmen and the missionary elite. George Lycurgus was arrested and fined for disturbing the peace and distributing alcohol without a liquor license. He believed the ulterior motive for his arrest was for his support of the monarchy. His brother, John, had difficulties obtaining licenses for various industries. Under the new government hula was banned and public concerts of Hawaiian music were outlawed. But private performances of Hawaiian music were legal and George Lycurgus hired the National Band to play at his hotel, Sans Souci, to the annoyance of pro-government supporters. The Greeks took part in opposing the Provisional Government and Republic. A number joined the counter- revolutionaries plotting to restore the monarchy. Hawaii‚Äôs Schuetzen Club was taken over by German, Austrian, Greek, and British royalists and transformed into a front organization to train counter-revolutionaries. The uprising was put down swiftly and royalists were captured and arrested, including some Greeks, of which two were exiled. Killing of Peter Camarinos Significant to the small Greek community at the time was the death of Peter G. Camarinos. Camarinos had been considered the one most aggressively in favor of the counter-revolution, a major planner and sponsor of the insurgency. He stated ‚ÄúI will give half that I am worth to see the damned Missionary sons of bitches hung‚Äù. By 1896 Camarinos had allegedly become mentally ill; his friends and family supported him and had him admitted to Andrews Asylum for the Insane in California. One year later he was dead; the asylum physician concluded he had died of paresis. Camarinos‚Äô family received his body in an advanced stage of decomposition two or three days after he had died. His family accused the asylum of purposefully using the decay to conceal bruises that implied that he had been kicked and beaten to death. John R. Griffith, who had been admitted to the asylum for dementia, witnessed Camarinos complain about his breakfast, then attack an attendant named John Lynn and then attack a nurse. Two other attendants intervened and threw Camarinos to the ground and held him down as Lynn jumped onto Camarinos‚Äô stomach repeatedly until Camarinos fainted. A critic of the Republic suggested the killing was ordered by Sanford B. Dole and William O. Smith to eliminate an enemy and make an example of Camarinos for opposing the Republic.

He was a contemporary of Mularaja, the first Chaulukya ruler of Anahilapataka (now Patan). Graharipu built or repaired Durgapalli, the ancient fort in Junagadh identified as Uparkot. The growing power of the Chudasama dynasty and his acts of harassing the pilgrims to Somnath temple resulted in his conflict with Mularaja. After a major and decisive battle, Mulraja defeated Graharipu. The ruler from Kutch, Laksha had fought alongside Graharipu in the battle and was killed. After this battle, the Chudasama domain was repeatedly attacked by subsequent Chaulukya rulers. Battle with Mularaja According to Hemachandra, who was patronized by the Chaulukyas, the Chaulukya king Mularaja defeated Graharipu. No other Chaulukya-era accounts mention this victory. According to Hemachandra, one night, Mahadeva appeared in Mularaja's dream, and ordered him to vanquish Graharipu. In the morning, Mularaja consulted his ministers Jambaka and Jehula, as he was apprehensive of causing troubles to the pilgrims who visited Prabhasa in Saurashtra. Jambaka was his Mahamantri (chief minister) while Jehula, the Ranaka of Kahiralu (now Kheralu), was his Mahapradhana (prime minister), according to Abhayatilakagani. Jehula told Mularaja that Graharipu was a tyrant who tortured pilgrims and indulged in vices such as eating flesh, drinking wine and hunting deer in sacred places. Jambaka described Graharipu as a very strong king, and declared that only Mularaja was capable of defeating him. Both the ministers urged Mularaja to attack Graharipu. Mularaja launched a campaign against Graharipu on the day of Vijayadashami. Graharipu attempted a peaceful resolution through a messenger, who informed Mularaja that Graharipu had no enmity with him. However, Mularaja turned the messenger away, and continued his march. Graharipu then started his war preparations. His allies included Medas, his friend's son Laksha, and a king named Sindhuraja. After the war began, he was joined by a mlechchha chief (who according to the Hemachandra's commentator Abhayatilaka Gani, was a Turushka). Mularaja was supported by the kings Gangamaha of Gangadvara and his younger brother, Mahirata, Revatimitra, and Shailaprastha. The Paramara king of Abu and Srimala also joined him. In addition, Mularaja was supported by the Bhillas and the Kauravas. After the battle began, several others including the king of Saptakashi and a number of Gujarati soldiers, joined him. The battle took place on the river Jambumali (identified as Bhogavo river in Saurashtra on which banks a village named Jambu near Limbdi is located). The battle continued for two days indecisively. On third day, Mularaja entered battle on an elephant and Graharipu mounted on his elephant in rage. Mularaja overpowered Graharipu in a single combat and throw him down from his elephant, and had him tied up with ropes. Laksha, wearing white clothes, rushed in and abused Mularaja calling him Mula. He asked Mularaja to release Graharipu, but Mularaja refused to comply, on the grounds that the captive was a beef-eater. This led to another single combat, in which Mularaja killed Laksha with a spear. The men of Saurashtra then made a submission before Mularaja, dressed as women. Queen and children of Graharipu request Mularaja to release him which he does. The king then released the prisoners and visited Prabhasa. According to Abhayatilakagani, Mularaja prayed on the day of Shivaratri. Within five-six days, Mularaja returned capital with 108 elephants. The fight between Mularaja and Laksha has also been mentioned by the 14th century writer Merutunga in Prabandhachintamani. According to this version, Laksha (or Lakha) was the ruler of Kachchha. He was son of Phulada and Kamalata, daughter of Parmara king Kirtiraja. He had repulsed Mularaja's attacks 11 times. However, in their 12th fight, Mularaja besieged his fort Kapilkot (now Kera, Kutch), killed him, and trod him on his beard. Enraged by his insulting action, Laksha's mother cursed Mularaja's family to be afflicted with leprosy. The similar account is also given in Kumarapalacharita. According to K. K. Shastri, this account seem more trustworthy. Laksha appears to be a historical character, as he has been mentioned in several other chronicles as well. The other kings listed by Hemachandra appear to be fictional names. Historian Asoke Majumdar theorizes that Mularaja attacked Graharipu on \\"some flimsy pretext\\", as Mahadeva's-order-in-a-dream was a popular device used by Sanskrit authors to justify the otherwise inexcusable actions of their heroes. Mularaja's descendants fought against the kings of Kachchha and Saurashtra, so it appears that he managed to subjugate these territories only partially. In bardic literature According to bardic tales, he was married to sister of Uga Vala, the chief of Talaja. According to bardic literature, Graharipu was the successor of Vishwavarah and he was succeeded by Kavat. He ruled possibly from 945 CE to 982 CE.

In 1890, he left his teaching job to do research on medicine full-time. He started a farm outside Tanjore for growing medicinal plants. He named it Karanandhapuram after his teacher. It was called as Pandithar thottam (Pandithar's farm) by the locals. He also started a clinic - the Karunanidhi Medical Hall at his residence in Tanjore. In 1909, the colonial government awarded him the \\"Rao Sahib\\" title. In 1911, Gnanavadivu died and Pandithar married Bhagyammal. The publication of Silapathikaram by U. V. Swaminatha Iyer in 1892, made Pandithar interested in Tamil music and he started studying it. He learnt traditional music as he is part of the maruthuvar/pandithar Community, from Sadayandi Bhattar and western classical music from Tanjore A. G. Pichaimuthu pillai. He did extensive research on the origins and form of Tamil music. He established the Sangeetha Vidhyalaya Mahajana Sangam - a music association and organised six music conferences during 1912‚Äì1914. In 1917, he published his research into Tamil music as Karunamirdha Sagaram, a 1346-page book, that remains a seminal work in the field till today. He also published Karunamirdha Sagara Thirattu - a collection of Tamil practice songs (musicians of that period trained using Telugu songs). He also translated several Keerthanais into Tamil. He attended the All India Music Conference held at Baroda in 1916 and presented his research there.  Death  Pandithar died in 1919.  Descendants  His family continued his research - His son Varaguna Pandiyan Pandithar wrote the Tamil musical research work Paanarkaivazhi and his daughter Maragathavalli Duraipandian Pandithar completed part 2 of Karunamirdha Sagaram. His grandson D. A. Thanapandian Pandithar is also a musician and musicologist. In 2008, the Government of Tamil Nadu nationalised his works. References Further reading & Notes *Kareem, C.K (1976).

Historic objects in Canada may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the federal government, the provincial governments, or a municipal government. The Heritage Canada Foundation acts as Canada's lead advocacy organization for heritage buildings and landscapes. Federal level There are a number of heritage designations at the federal level for historic sites in Canada: * National Historic Sites of Canada are places that have been designated by the federal Minister of the Environment on the advice of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada (HSMBC), as being of national historic significance; * Heritage Railway Stations are train stations owned by federally licensed railway companies recommended for protection by the HSMBC; * Heritage Lighthouses are lighthouses deemed to be historically significant; and * Federal Heritage Buildings are buildings owned by the federal government which are determined to be of historical and/or architectural value. The federal government also operates related programs for the recognition of historic persons (National Historic Persons) and events (National Historic Events). Provinces plaque indicates that the building is protected by the Government of Alberta Each provincial government has distinct systems and approaches to heritage conservation. They may delegate the authority to preserve historic buildings to municipalities, and / or have a provincial heritage register. For example, in the province of Alberta, only sites owned by the provincial government and run as a functioning historic site or museum are known as Provincial Historic Sites or Provincial Historic Areas. Buildings and sites owned by private citizens and companies or other levels or branches of government may gain one of two levels of historic designation, \\"Registered Historic Resource\\" or \\"Provincial Historic Resource\\". Historic designation in Alberta is governed by the Historic Resources Act.Alberta Queen's Printer The province also lists buildings deemed historically significant by municipal governments on the Alberta Register of Historic Places, which is also part of the larger Canadian Register of Historic Places although this does not imply provincial or federal government status or protection.Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Alberta's Historic Places Designation Program - Municipal Historic Resource Designation To supplement this system, the province also run the Alberta Main Street Program which helps to preserve historic buildings in the downtowns of smaller communities.The Alberta Main Street Program The basis for the preservation system in Alberta is the Heritage Survey Program, which is a survey of 80,000 historic buildings in Alberta which lack a protected status but are documented for possible future protection.Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Heritage Survey Program In Quebec, the R√©pertoire du patrimoine culturel du Qu√©bec is the main heritage register, it includes both protected and unprotected properties. The Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Qu√©bec is a non-profit organization created in 1995 to promote the conservation of churches and other religious heritage buildings in the province. Municipalities Cities, towns, counties and other local government in Canada may use zoning and other bylaws to restrict the demolition of individual historic buildings or districts. They may maintain a municipal heritage register, such as Edmonton's \\"Register of Historic Resources in Edmonton\\".City of Edmonton The city of Vancouver uses a traditional heritage registerVancouver.ca and a new system called a density bank, under which developers are rewarded for preserving and restoring heritage buildings by being awarded exceptions to restrictions (usually height restrictions) on other sites they own.http://cityhallwatch.wordpress.com/special- topics/density-bank-transfers-and-more/ In Montreal, one of Canada's oldest and most historically rich cities, the Le Conseil du patrimoine de Montr√©al advises the municipal government on matters related to heritage building preservation. A pair of non-governmental groups have worked to preserve Montreal historic buildings since the 1970s: Save Montreal, co-founded by Michael Fish in 1974, and Heritage Montreal, founded by Phyllis Lambert two years later.Gravenor, Kristian (October 23, 2003). \\"The museum that is Montreal \\", Montreal Mirror 19 (19).

Government approach to policy  Two of the primary conservation tools in Canada are the Canadian Register of Historic Places and the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada. This document was the result of a major collaborative effort among federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, heritage conservation professionals, heritage developers and many individual Canadians. A pan‚ÄìCanadian collaboration, it is intended to reinforce the development of a culture of conservation in Canada, which will continue to find a unique expression in each of the jurisdictions and regions of the country. In the document, conservation approaches are broken down into three categories: Preservation, Rehabilitation, and Restoration.

The game is a Vertical Shooter similar to Xenon 2, but unlike the inspiration, the player controls a beer bottle and destroys bottles belonging to rival beer companies. History = Development = In the 1990s some students of the ETH Z√ºrich formed a game development group called \\"Alpha Helix\\" and developed \\"The last Eichhof\\" as comment against the concentration of the Swiss beer market which led to the decline of smaller and independent breweries like \\"Eichhof\\". The Last Eichhof's code and levels were created by Daniel \\"Tritone\\" Schoch, graphics and fonts were credited to \\"Tweety\\". Additional programming and music was provided by \\"Zynax\\". Much of the music in \\"The Last Eichhof\\" comes from the songs \\"Schnaps Bonus\\" and \\"Bring me Edelweiss\\" by the pop band Edelweiss. The instrumental from the Pink Floyd song, \\"Money\\" plays during this stage where you can sell beer bottles. Many sound effects were samples taken from the TV sitcom Parker Lewis Can't Lose.

Not only does the amount of brew collected boost the player's score but it also provides money needed to buy supplies from the pub. In most of the levels, waves of mugs, bottles and tankards will attack the player followed by minibosses (usually crates and rival beer logos) and occasionally big bosses. In one of the levels, the player is faced by hostile champagne bottles, Daiquiris, tequilas, martinis, Jack Daniel's, and Bourbon. Most of the enemies have an alcohol theme. In one of the levels, the enemies are items associated with hangovers: alarm clocks, coffee pots, toilets, Alka-Seltzer, Aspirin. However, there are a few enemies in the game which do not have any alcohol-related theme (Windows logo, Pac- Man, MacIntosh Apple logo, toaster screensaver). The main beer bottle must be protected and avoid enemies, otherwise a life is lost. If all lives are lost the game is over. Bottles that accompany the main beer bottle cannot ever be destroyed. Once a level has been completed, the player stops by at the pub to buy extra bottles of beer to assist the main beer bottle. Four standard bottles (Stange, Pony, Barbara Braeu and Dunkel) can be purchased from the counter and many others (Can 33CL, Chuebeli, Pokal, Xenon 2 Cannon, plus Bonus Guttere for lives and Speed) can be purchased from the Menu Card. Up to six bottles can accompany the main beer bottle. After each level, the player has the choice of selling the bottles for a small reduction of what they first cost. There are 5 levels; between each level, the player is given a chance to buy extra bottles, each with their own shooting projectiles. Note that the second to fifth level have checkpoints. So if the main beer bottle is hit, the player restarts at the last checkpoint successfully passed instead of restarting at the beginning of the level.

Early life and family Mary was the daughter of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, and his second wife, Margery Golding. Her mother was the half-sister of translator Arthur Golding. Mary's brother was Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, who married Anne Cecil, the daughter of Lord Burghley. Marriages and issue In 1577 Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, successfully courted Mary. His mother, Katherine Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk, was opposed to the match, partly because of the conduct of Mary's brother, who had accused his wife Anne of adultery in 1575; but eventually her father, Burghley, acted as a go between to obtain the permission of Queen Elizabeth I for the marriage to go ahead. Mary de Vere and Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, had seven children:Charles Mosley, editor.

They were married in 1578 and made their home at Grimsthorpe Castle, while Peregrine's parents moved to London.

Bioliquids are usually made from virgin or used vegetable and seed oils, like palm or soya oil. These oils are burned in a power station to create heat, which can then be used to warm homes or boil water to make steam. This steam can then be used to drive a turbine to generate electricity. Rudolf Diesel's first public exhibition of the internal combustion engine, that was to later bear his name, ran on peanut oil. Bioliquid production and use Bioliquids have been used for many years to provide heat for homes on a small scale but now big energy providers are looking at their use on a larger scale. A controversial plant in Bristol (UK) was recently given the go ahead despite receiving several hundred complaints.BBC News: Bristol biofuel plant given go- ahead by Eric Pickles The plant will be built and operated by W4B and provide enough power for 25,000 homes. Advantages Bioliquids have several key advantages over other sources of renewable energy: * Bioliquids have a high energy density * The technology is well established, having been used for many years * Can be used on demand, reacting quickly to changes in demand for power * Can help reduce dependency on foreign oil. * Reduces the green house gas emissions. Disadvantages Many of the same problems that affect biofuels also affect bioliquids and there are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating oil prices, the \\"food vs fuel\\" debate, poverty reduction potential, carbon emissions levels, sustainable biofuel production, deforestation and soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, impact on water resources, as well as energy balance and efficiency. Bioliquids also have several key problems compared to other sources of renewable energy:National Non-Food Crops Centre.

The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance and administered by the Croatian Health Insurance Fund. In 2012, annual compulsory healthcare related expenditures reached 21.0 billion kuna (approximately 2.8 billion euro). Expenditure Healthcare expenditures comprise 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending. In 2012, Croatia spent 6.8% of its GDP on healthcare, down from approximately 8% estimated in 2008, when 84% of healthcare spending came from public sources. Croatia ranked around the 50th in the world in life expectancy with 73 years for men and 79 years for women, and it had a low infant mortality rate of 6 per 1,000 live births. Institutions There are hundreds of healthcare institutions in Croatia, including 79 hospitals and clinics with 25,285 beds, caring for more than 760,000 patients per year. Ownership of hospitals is shared between the state and the Counties of Croatia. There are 5,792 private practice offices, and a total of 46,020 health workers in the country, including 10,363 medical doctors. There are 79 emergency medical service units that performed more than one million interventions in 2012. The Euro health consumer index placed it 16th in Europe, commenting that it did well with kidney transplants, performing more than 50 per million per year, and speculating that it might become a health tourism destination, as a state-of-the-art hip joint operation can be had for ‚Ç¨3000. Health The principal cause of death in 2011 was cardiovascular disease at 41.7% for men and 55.4% for women, followed by tumours, at 31.7% for men and 22.8% for women. In 2012 only 20 Croatians had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 6 had died from the disease. In 2008 it was estimated by the WHO that 27.4% of Croatians over age of 15 are smokers. According to 2003 WHO data, 22% of the Croatian adult population is obese. It had the second lowest rate of death from communicable diseases in Europe (12 per 100,000) in 2015.  2020 COVID-19 Presence in Croatia  On 25 February, Croatia confirmed its first case. A 26-year-old man who had stayed in Milan, Italy from 19 to 21 February tested positive and was hospitalised at the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases Dr. Fran Mihaljeviƒá in Zagreb, Croatia. On 26 February, two new cases were confirmed. The second case involved the twin brother of the individual on the first case. He was also admitted to the same hospital. The third case involved a Croatian man who worked in Parma, Italy. He was hospitalised in Rijeka. As of 29 February, there were seven confirmed cases in Croatia. As of 4:10pm, March 17th 2020, there have been 65 cases. Four patients are currently known to be cured.

According to this belief, the official elected government is subservient to the shadow government, which is the true executive power. Some of the groups proposed by these theories as constituting the shadow government include central banks, Freemasons, intelligence agencies, think tanks, organized Jewry, the Vatican, secret societies, Jesuits, moneyed interests, globalist elites, and supranational organizations who seek to manipulate policy in their own interest or in order to serve a larger agenda that is hidden from the general public. History Literature on the subject postulates the existence of a secret government which is the true power behind the apparent government. Examples of such literature include works by Dan Smoot, William Guy Carr, Jim Marrs, Carroll Quigley, Gary Allen, Alex Jones, Des Griffin, G. Edward Griffin, David Icke, and Michael A. Hoffman II. Some of these authors believe members of the secret government may represent or be agents for groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Royal Institute for International Affairs, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, CIA and MI6 in co-operation with international banks and financial institutions such as the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements.Chatham House (RIIA) and the CFR, its US sister organization, are the focus of Quigley's The Anglo-American Establishment.The CFR as a central institution of the secret government of the United States is the focus of James Perloff's book The Shadows of PowerJim Marrs cites all the institutions listed in this paragraph in his study Rule By Secrecy, published by Harper Collins. Also popularizing the idea was the hit US television show, The X-Files. Milton William Cooper claimed that the shadow government was in cooperation with extraterrestrial aliens. His 1991 book Behold A Pale Horse, influential among \\"UFO and militia circles\\", describes \\"the doings of the secret world government\\" and \\"a variety of other covert activities associated with the Illuminati's declaration of war upon the people of America\\". Cooper claimed to have seen secret documents while in the Navy describing governmental dealings with aliens. Cooper linked the Illuminati with his beliefs that extraterrestrials were secretly involved with the US government, but later retracted these claims. He accused Dwight D. Eisenhower of negotiating a treaty with extraterrestrials in 1954, then establishing an inner circle of Illuminati to manage relations with them and keep their presence a secret from the general public. Cooper believed that aliens \\"manipulated and/or ruled the human race through various secret societies, religions, magic, witchcraft, and the occult\\", and that even the Illuminati were unknowingly being manipulated by them. Cooper described the Illuminati as a secret international organization, controlled by the Bilderberg Group, that conspired with the Knights of Columbus, Masons, Skull and Bones, and other organizations. Its ultimate goal, he said, was the establishment of a New World Order. According to Cooper the Illuminati conspirators not only invented alien threats for their own gain, but actively conspired with extraterrestrials to take over the world. Cooper believed that James Forrestal's fatal fall from a window on the sixteenth floor of Bethesda Hospital was connected to the alleged secret committee Majestic-12, and that JASON advisory group scientists reported to an elite group of Trilateral Commission and Council on Foreign Relations executive committee members who were high-ranking members of the Illuminati.

D. 70‚Äì96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 191, 218 Celsus Polemaeanus was a wealthy and popular citizen and benefactor of Ephesus, and was buried in a sarcophagus beneath the famous Library of Celsus, which was built as a mausoleum in his honor by his son Tiberius Julius Aquila Polemaeanus. Biography The Library of Celsus, which was founded by Celsus who is buried in a sarcophagus beneath the library. Celsus was born about 45 to a family of Greek origin in either Ephesus or Sardis. His family were priests in Rome and were originally from Sardis in Asia Minor. They had been granted Roman citizenship, and some of them held official positions in the service of the Roman Empire. The cursus honorum of Celsus has been recorded in a Latin inscription recovered at Ephesus. = ILS 8971 According to it, his earliest recorded office was military tribune in Legio III Cyrenaica, which was part of the garrison of Roman Egypt. The next recorded event in his life was his adlection into the Senate inter aedilicios by Vespasian and his son Titus, which was a reward Vespasian is known to have made to individuals who supported him during the Year of the Four Emperors. Exactly how Celsus supported Vespasian is not known: the governor of Egypt at the time, Tiberius Julius Alexander, was the first governor to declare publicly for Vespasian (1 July 69);Gwyn Morgan, 69 A.D.: The Year of Four Emperors (Oxford: University Press, 2006), pp. 184f a vexillation of Legio III Cyrenaica participated in the Jewish War and Celsus may have come to Vespasian's notice that way. Regardless of the reason, promotion to the Senate was a significant social and political achievement for Celsus. Following this, Celsus achieved the republican magistracy of praetor of the people of Rome, requiring his presence in the capital city. Then he was appointed praetorian legate to the provincial complex of Cappadociae et Galatiae Ponti, Pisidiae Paphlagoniae, Armeniae minoris, an aggregation of territory that later became the provinces of Roman Cappadocia, Galatia, Paphlagonia, and Roman Armenia. This presents a problem: at this time (75-79) the garrison of this territory included two legions, which implies this governorship would normally be assigned to someone who had previously been consul; further, the governor of Galatia at this time is known to be Marcus Hirrius Fronto Neratius Pansa. Mireille Corbier provides a possible explanation: Celsus was acting here as an independent, yet subordinate associate to Neratius Pansa.Corbier, L'aerarium saturni et l'aerarium militare; Administration et prosopographie s√©natoriale, Publications de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, 24 (Rome: √âcole Fran√ßaise de Rome, 1974), p. 376 The next steps in his career are less problematic. Celsus was then commissioned legatus legionis or commander of Legio IV Scythica (about 81-82); with this, Bernard R√©my observes, Celsus became the first known person from Anatolia to command a Roman legion.R√©my, Les carri√®res s√©natoriales dans les provinces romaines d'Anatolie au Haut-Empire (31 av. J.-C. - 284 ap. J.-C.) (Istanbul: Institut Fran√ßais d'√âtudes Anatoliennes-Georges Dum√©zil, 1989), p. 63 n. 41 He returned to Rome where the sortition allotted him the province of Bithynia and Pontus -- then one of the public provinces -- as his to govern (84/85).Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron 13 (1983), p. 309 Celsus proceeded to Rome where the emperor Domitian appointed him one of the three prefects of the aerarium militare (85-87), then returned to the East where he was governor of Cilicia from the years 89 to 91.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 316-318 It was at this point that Celsus acceded to suffect consul. After discharging his duties as consul, Celsus was admitted to the quindecimviri sacris faciundis, one of the four most prestigious collegia of priests of ancient Rome. His stay in Rome was further prolonged by serving as curator of the aedium sacrum et operum locorumque publicorum, or overseer of maintaining the temples, public buildings and places of Rome, an important administrative duty.Corbier, L'aerarium saturni, p. 377 However, by this point Domitian had grown suspicious of Senators and other powerful individuals to the point of paranoia,For a discussion of this period, see Brian W. Jones, The Emperor Domitian (London: Routledge, 1993), pp. 180-192 and Celsus quietly returned home to Ephesus. With the reign of Trajan, Celsus returned to public life, and served a term as proconsular governor of Asia in 105/106.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", p. 341 He died some time before 117, the year Gaius Julius Severus of Ancyra erected a monument mentioning Celsus Polemaeanus.Corbier, L'aerarium saturni, p. 378  Family  From the numerous inscriptions in Ephesus that relate to him, Corbier was able to determine many details of Celsus Polemaeanus' family.Corbier, L'aerarium saturni, pp. 377f Celsus had married a Quintilla, possibly related to the provincial family known to have flourished at Alexandria Troas at this time. Together they had at least three children: * Julia Quintilla Isauria. Corbier suggests she acquired the nickname \\"Isauria\\" because she was born while Celsus was legate of Cappadocia and the related territories. She married Tiberius Claudius Julianus; their grandson Tiberius Claudius Julianus was suffect consul in 154. * Tiberius Julius Aquila Polemaeanus, suffect consul in 110. * A daughter, who married a member of the gens Scribonia; their son Scribonianus is attested as procurator Augusti. Library of Celsus The Library of Celsus in Ephesus was built to honor Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus after his death. He paid for the library from his own personal wealth, and bequeathed a large sum of money for its construction which was carried out by his son Julius Aquila Polemaeanus. The library was built to store 12,000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus, being both a crypt containing his sarcophagus and a sepulchral monument to his memory. The library collapsed after Ephesus was deserted but its fa√ßade was restored by an Austrian archaeology foundation in the 1970s.

The shear strength of a discontinuity is often considerably lower than the shear strength of the blocks of intact material in between the discontinuities, and therefore influences, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope engineering, but also the stability of natural slopes. Many slopes, natural and man-made, fail due to a low shear strength of discontinuities in the soil or rock mass in the slope. The deformation characteristics of a soil or rock mass are also influenced by the shear strength of the discontinuities. For example, the modulus of deformation is reduced, and the deformation becomes plastic (i.e. non-reversible deformation on reduction of stress) rather than elastic (i.e. reversible deformation). This may cause, for example, larger settlement of foundations, which is also permanent even if the load is only temporary. Furthermore, the shear strength of discontinuities influences the stress distribution in a soil or rock mass. Shear strength The shear strength along a discontinuity in a soil or rock mass in geotechnical engineering is governed by the persistence of the discontinuity, roughness of discontinuity surfaces, infill material in the discontinuity, presence and pressure of gasses and fluids (e.g. water, oil), and possible solution (e.g. karst) and cementation along the discontinuity. Further the shear strength is dependent on whether the discontinuity has moved before in the geological history (i.e. are the asperities on opposing walls of the discontinuity fitting or non- fitting, or have the asperities been sheared off). Determination shear strength Only for simple models of discontinuities the shear strength can be analytically calculated. For real discontinuities no analytical calculation method exists. Testing on various scales in the laboratory or in the field, or empirical calculations based on characterizing the discontinuity are used to establish the shear strength.

Medieval Britain operated under a strict feudal system. Society was rigidly structured in a pyramidal form with the King (or Queen) at the apex as the highest authority in the land, ordinary citizens at the bottom with a variety of Lords, Bishops, Judges and other noblemen and landowners ranking variously in between. Allegiance and subservience to the Crown was required by all men and women at all times and on most occasions was demonstrated by the swearing of oaths. One such occasion occurred twice a year, when the Sheriff of Northumberland met with the Crown Judges who came to Newcastle upon Tyne and sat on the Assizes to hear any legal matters which required their attention. To further emphasise the importance and solemnity of these visitations, a procession was to be held prior to the official meeting of the parties.Marshall, 1991: 127, Para 1 At an inquisition at Tynemouth in 1278, it was duly declared that the King of Scotland, the Archbishop of York, the Prior of Tynemouth, the Bishop of Durham and Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus should arrange to meet with the justices prior to their entry into Newcastle, provided that they came through the county of Yorkshire first.McKenzie, 1827, 746 at fn 1 Ye Olde Cannon circa 1850, where the procession would 'light and go' to be served wine and punch. Photograph taken from Gateshead Council public archive On the appointed day, usually a Saturday, the procession of these learned men would take place, starting in Newcastle upon Tyne before crossing the River Tyne and passing into Gateshead. After a short refreshment break,- at Sheriff Mount, the procession then made its way slowly up the old (and remarkably steep) turnpike road until all concerned parties came to the designated meeting place.Marshall, 1991: 128, Para 1 This was initially established at Chile Well,Hair, 1844 at FN1.

Available online at http://www.dmm-gallery.org.uk/books/votc-22.htm (retrieved 16 March 2011) This place was chosen because of the convenience of both the gentry of Northumberland and for the judges journeying from Durham, the sheriff having used the stables at Sheriff Mount - to change horse before the hill climb , this is a detached Victorian villa built and known as Sheriff Mount North & Sheriff Mount South - the large Mount stone bears presence to this fact , IHe rode uphill onward to the olde canon The guy who compiled this is clearly not owning the house , and knows not the entire truth EnglandDurham and it was there that wine and punch were again served to the members of the precession at the expense of the Sheriffs who would wait there until the judges made their arrival.Marshall, 1991: 129, Para 2 Once they had done so, all would return to Newcastle upon Tyne. It is not known for certain whether or not Chile Well was situated on the old turnpike road, but it is certainly possible that the two meeting points were one and the same place.Marshall, 1991: 129, Para 3 A well was for many years situated across the road from the Cannon and this certainly lends credence to the possibility that the sites were, in fact, the same.Marshall, 1991: 130, Para 2 Intriguingly, the well was inscribed: > \\"As cold waters to a thirsty soul > So is good news from a far country.\\"The inscription is copied into a book of > assorted scraps donated to Gateshead Central Library.

This procession took place for over five hundred years, even continuing after the English Civil War in the seventeenth century had effectively destroyed the feudal system as the principal means of rule in Britain. Indeed, the procession was held until 1825 when, upon the completion of the far less steep turnpike road through Low Fell, the procession was rerouted and the meeting place became The New Cannon situated at the junction between the turnpike road and the Low Fell Road (now Beaconsfield Road and Belle Vue Bank).McKenzie, 1827, 746 at fn 1 In 1832, miners at the Sheriff Hill Colliery went on strike in protest of pay and the dangerous conditions at the colliery.Manders, 1973: 311 When the Sheriff's March reached the area of Gateshead Fell, they were confronted by angry workers carrying a banner depicting a rat taking cheese from the working menManders, 1973: 312 Shortly after, a Commons bill in 1838 abolished such processions and so the tradition was halted and the travelling dignitaries had to be accommodated at the expense of their hosts.Marshall, 1991: 131, Para 1 An attempt to revive the procession in 1845 by the High Sheriff, Ralph Carr Elison, was largely abortive and no further attempt was made.Marshall, 1991: 132 It is as a direct result of the \\"Sheriff's March\\" that the area around Ye Olde Cannon and the old turnpike road became known as Sheriff Hill.Hair, 1844 at FN1.

The original building on the site was a five-story concrete and steel building with a pressed brick facade building constructed in 1913, to house the J.F. Cairns Department Store. J. F. Cairns settled in Saskatoon in 1902, opening the first mill in the city before entering the retail business. The five story building was built by G.H. Archibald and Company containing 90,255 square feet. The building was taken over the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) department store chain in 1922 making it the 11th department store location for HBC. On October 14, 1922, the Chippendale style, Imperial Restaurant opened on the fourth floor, the restaurant contained banquet facilities and was used for special events in the city. The original building was torn down and in 1960 the Hudson's Bay Company opened in a new more modern three story building on the same site. At a cost of $3 Million the building provided of retail space over three floors and had provision for the addition of two more floors. In 1967, a fourth floor was added as well as a skywalk to a six floor parkade. In 2000, HBC left the building to move into the former Eaton's location in Midtown Plaza (Saskatoon) shopping centre a few blocks away. In 2004, Wayne Lemauviel, Gary Bender and later Gene Dub purchased the building and began work on converting the building into lofts. A fifth story was added to the building, and due to the high ceiling on each floor it was possible to create each loft with an internal mezzanine. The ground floor was retained as retail space. The same year, the skybridge across Second Avenue was removed and the parkade torn- down. The interior design on the building has won an Award of Excellence. The conversion from retail to lofts is part of a larger residential revival occurring in the central business district with an influx of people moving into the area.

Blanch, n√©e Lundquist, (December 31, 1895 ‚Äì October 31, 1981), was an American painter and Guggenheim Fellow. She was noted for her murals, commissioned by the government during the Great Depression years of the 1930s to create a more uplifting environment. Early life and Education Lucile E. Blanch was born in 1895 in Hawley, Minnesota to Charles E. and May E. Lundquist. She was variously known as Lucille Blanch, Lucile Lunquist Blanch, Lucile Lundquist-Blanch, and Lucille Lundquist-Blanch. She studied at the Minneapolis School of Art with her future husband Arnold Blanch, and other notable artists like Harry Gottlieb and Adolf Dehn. From 1918, she studied on a scholarship under Boardman Robinson, as part of the Art Students League of New York. She also studied with artists like Kenneth Hayes Miller, Frank Vincent DuMond and Frederick R. Gruger. While in New York, she married her husband, Arnold Blanch, and they traveled to France to continue their art studies.  Career  Lundquist and her husband later moved to Woodstock, New York where they helped build the Woodstock Art colony. They divorced in 1935.She was friends with Eugenie Gershoy, who sculpted her at work. After her move to Woodstock, New York, Blanch began exhibiting work in local group shows as well as with the New York Society of Women Artists and the Whitney Studio Club. As Lucile and her husband Arnold were building their reputation as Woodstock artists they supported themselves by selling tapestries they wove, as well as running a small cafeteria. They eventually would become key figures in the revitalization of the Woodstock Art Colony. She received the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1933, and from that point on her art was collected and was shown in a number of important galleries, notably the Whitney Museum. From 1932 to 1943, the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art and Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Whitney Museum, and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C. had were collecting her work. After her divorce to Arnold Blanch, Lucile taught at the Ringling School of Art in Sarasota, Florida from 1935 to 1936. In 1937, she was given a solo exhibition at the Milch Galleries. Also in 1937, her work appeared in an exhibition of American oil paintings at the Whitney Museum of American Arts which showcased realistic scenes along side surrealist and abstract work. In 1939, she participated in an annual contemporary American watercolor show yet again at the Whitney Museum of American Art which included seventy artists who were invited to send two watercolor or pastel works each. Later in 1939, Blanch participated in an exhibition by the American Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Gravers - their first since 1932. The exhibition began May 16, 1939 and continued until June 10 that same year. =Murals= Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The murals were intended to boost the morale of the American people suffering from the effects of the Depression by depicting uplifting subjects the people knew and loved. Murals were commissioned through competitions open to all artists in the United States.Rediscovering the People's Art: New Deal Murals in Pennsylvania‚Äôs Post Offices \\". Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission: 2014. Almost 850 artists were commissioned to paint 1371 murals, most of which were installed in post offices.University of Central Arkansas. \\"Arkansas Post Office Murals \\". 162 of the artists were women. The murals were funded as a part of the cost of the construction of new post offices, with 1% of the cost set aside for artistic enhancements. In 1938 Lucile Blanch painted an oil on canvas WPA commissioned mural titled Osceola Holding Informal Court with His Chiefs in the United States post office in Fort Pierce, Florida. The mural is on display at Fort Pierce City Hall. In the town of Appalachia, Virginia, she painted the mural Appalachia, also oil on canvas in 1940. The tempera mural, Rural Mississippi-from Early Days to Present was completed in 1941 for the Tylertown, Mississippi post office. In addition, she painted murals in the post offices of Flemingsburg, Kentucky and Sparta, Georgia. The Flemingsburg mural was completed in 1943 as an oil on canvas, titled Crossing to the Battle of Blue Licks, while the Sparta post office project consisted of three panels. The oils on canvas depicted an antebellum plantation house, the granite quarry near Sparta and the third showed local Hancock County scenery. Blanch was one of the few artists who actually painted WPA murals in the same town for which the work was commissioned and accepted input from local residents prior to the painting process.  Death  She died in 1981 in Kingston, New York. Style Blanch began her career focusing on realist subjects, but she increasingly became an abstractionist. By 1928, Blanch's style was set apart by color and humor. Her choice of subject at this time coming primarily from circus performers and animals shown depicted in bright spot lighting.  Awards  In 1931, Blanch was awarded Medal of First Award for Graphic Arts at San Francisco Art Association's annual exhibit. In 1933, Blanch was given a fellowship by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation to enable creative work in painting abroad for one year. The average monetary value of the fellowships given that year were $2,500 each. In 1934, received a prize for her work at the Wanamaker Regional Exhibition in New York.

Persistence determines the possibilities of relative movement along a discontinuity in a soil or rock mass in geotechnical engineering. Discontinuities are usually differentiated in persistent, non-persistent, and abutting discontinuities (figure). Persistent discontinuity A persistent discontinuity is a continuous plane in a soil or rock mass. Shear displacement takes place if the shear stress along the discontinuity plane exceeds the shear strength of the discontinuity plane. Non-persistent discontinuity A non-persistent discontinuity ends in intact soil or rock. Before movement of the material on both sides of a non- persistent discontinuity is possible, the discontinuity has to extend and break through intact material. As intact material has virtually always far higher shear strength than the discontinuity, a non-persistent discontinuity will have larger shear strength than a persistent discontinuity. Abutting discontinuity An abutting discontinuity abuts against another discontinuity. Abutting discontinuities might continue at the other side of the intersecting discontinuity, however, with a displacement to give so-called ‚Äòstepped planes‚Äô. Shear displacement along the discontinuity can take place if the shear strength along the discontinuity plane is exceeded, and the blocks of material against which the discontinuity abuts can move or break.

Subduction changes direction at Taiwan. The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, which is moving to the northeast. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant. South of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting under the Sunda Plate, forming the Luzon Volcanic Arc (including Green Island and Orchid Island). The east and south of the island are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the Luzon Volcanic Arc and the Eurasian Plate, where accreted portions of the Luzon Arc and Luzon forearc form the eastern Coastal Range and parallel inland Taitung Longitudinal Valley of Taiwan respectively.Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes, p84‚Äì86 To the northeast, the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting under the Okinawa Plate, forming the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc. Taiwan seismicity, showing both magnitude and depth of earthquakes. Terranes Haian Range The Hai'an Range or Coastal Range terrane belongs to the Luzon Volcanic Arc (ÂëÇÂÆãÂ≥∂ÁÅ´Â±±Âºß), and is on the Philippine Sea Plate (Ëè≤ÂæãË≥ìÊµ∑ÊùøÂ°ä). West of this is the Longitudinal Valley or Huatung Valley, an active depositional zone in a rift valley. West of this is the Eastern Central Range terrane, part of the continental base that has been upturned. The western side of the range is the Western Central Range terrane, which is metamorphosed earlier Tertiary clastic sediments. The Lishan Fault separates the Hsuehshan Range terrane Eocene to Oligocene sandstone and shale. The Chukou Fault (Ëß∏Âè£Êñ∑Â±§) provides the boundary for the Western Foothills terrane, which is shallow marine detritus from Miocene to Pleistocene. A deformation front forms the boundary with the undeformed coastal plains alluvium, which is still depositing. The Eastern Central Range terrane can be divided into the Tailuko belt on the west with greenschist metamorphism and the Yuli belt on the east with blueschist metamorphism. The two metamorphic belts are possibly separated by a fault called Shoufeng fault, but this is unproven. Central Mountains Central Mountain Range The oldest exposed rocks are heavily metamorphosed and found in the Central Mountains. Poor quality fossil evidence suggests an origin in the Permian Period. They form a band of rock from Nan'ao in the north to inland of Jinfeng on the eastern flank of the Central Mountain Range. The band is 30 km wide in the north and narrows to the south. These earlier rocks are heavily metamorphosed. They also occur as a basement beneath the western part of the island. They make up the Danana'ao Group or Tananao Schist. This group consists of the Kainanagang Gneiss, Tailuge Marble, and Changchun Schist. The Yuli Schist is Cretaceous in age and consists of black schist and some greenschist, glaucophane schist, and spotted slate. It is the easternmost part and extends from Chian southwards to the west of the Chihpen hot springs in a belt about 150 km long. Although the dark colour of the black schist is due to carbon, carbon is less than 2% of the content. The minerals found are quartz, mica, chlorite, albite, sphene, and graphite. The Changchun Schist being mostly greenschist is found on the western side and forms thick beds. It is found along with smaller amounts of chert, and black schist. The rock is foliated dark green rock containing chlorite, epidote, quartz, calcite, biotite, albite and actinolite. They are derived from mafic volcanic rocks. These rocks can host copper sulfide ores. Siliceous schists are coloured grey, they are metamorphosed sandstone, rich in quartz. Quartzite and chert bands can be found, and they are commonly associated with the black schist. The Chiuchu Formation or Tailuge Marble forms a band from Tailuko in the north to a point between Wulu and Kuanshan in the south. The limestone is mined in quarries south of Suao for cement manufacture. Although the colour is usually a shade of grey, there are also black or white limestone, which is chopped into blocks for building purposes. dolomite is also found along with the limestone particularly at Chingchangshan, Hopingchi, and Mukuashan. The Kainangan Gneiss or Kanagan Formation occurs in several elongated bodies. The gneiss derived from sedimentary rocks contains coarse grained quartz, biotite, and albitic plagioclase. There is also orthogneiss derived from granite. This is light grey and contains sodic plagioclase, quartz, biotite, and muscovite. Within the gneiss there are pegmatite dikes containing quartz, feldspar and mica. Other igneous rocks found in the old metamorphic belt are amphibolite and dolerite dikes. Serpentinite is found 5 km west of Fengtien (Â•âÂ§©). It contains exploited deposits of nephrite, talc and asbestos. Wanjung Station (Ëê¨Ê¶Æ) is close to more outcrops of serpentenite. Tamayenshan block northwest of Juisui (ÁëûÁ©ó) and the Tsenghuanshan block 10 km west of Juisui are significant ultramafic outcrops. Green serpentinite from near Yuli makes a good quality building stone. A band of ultramafic rocks extends for 25 km north of Litao, Taitung (Èõ¢Â≥∂). The area was subjected to the Nanao Orogeny around 85 Ma which involved the granite intrusion and regional metamorphism. Rifting that opened the South China Sea around 40 Ma may be connected with some dolerite intrusions. The Penglai Orogeny started about 10 Ma and continues at the present time. Eastern stratigraphic region The most recently added part of the island is the Coastal Range on the east coast from Taitung City in the south to Hualien City in the north. The range is the continuation of the Luzon arc. The age is Neogene and the rock consist of melange and volcaniclastics. The rock units are firstly Chimei Volcanics Miocene andesite. Next is the Tuluanshan Formation, consisting of tuff, then Takangou Formation, consisting of sediments such as shale and sandstone that contain volcanic particles. The Lichi Formation consists of melange. It is made of mud containing blocks of other stone such as sandstone and ophiolite. It is found on the southern half of the west side of the Coastal range. When this erodes, badlands are formed. Because it is a mixture of stone, the Lichi Formation is hard to date, but is likely to be from Pliocene. The Pinanshan conglomerate is found on Pinanshan Hill and along the Pinantachi stream north of Taitung (Âè∞Êù±). The constituents are 5‚Äì15 cm cobbles erodes by freshwater from the Central Range. It formed somewhere from middle to late Pleistocene, and indicates the plate collision had taken place. The Milun Conglomerate is to the north of Hualien. This has also gone under the names of Beiron Conglomerate Formation and Milunpi Conglomerate. It is tilted at 30¬∞. It is undated but is likely from Pleistocene. Central Mountains strata Shibachongxi Formation is from the Eocene consisting of slate and then beds of metamorphosed sandstone. The total thickness is up to 1000 m. Dajian Formation consists of sandstone from the upper Eocene, up to 2700 meters thick. Xichun Formation slate and phyllite is from the lower Oligocene. The thickness is from 0.6 to 3 km. Siling Formation coarse sandstone in thick beds is from the Oligocene. Shuichungliu Formation form the Oligocene contains argillaceous slate and graywacke. Bilushan Formation contains slate and phyllite from the Eocene. Lushan Formation from the Miocene contains shale slate and sandstone. Aodi Formation contemporary Sule Formation slate and sandstone from the later Miocene. Western stratigraphic region The west part of the island exposes deformed and metamorphosed Cenozoic sediments, overlaid by Quaternary piedmont region in the flat plains on the west coast. Cretaceous, Paleocene and Eocene deposits are not exposed on the surface, but are buried. They have been discovered by drilling. The Yunlin Formation is from the Cretaceous and only known from boreholes. The rocks are siltstone, basalt, shale and limestone. The Paleocene Wangong Formation consisting of volcaniclastics, sandstone, shale and limestone is over 1046 meters thick. In the Eocene the Shuangji Formation formed mostly from volcanic particles in the form of tuff and tuffaceous sandstone. These beds are from 100 m to 3 km thick. In the Oligocene the Wuzhishan Formation or Wuchihshan Formation (‰∫îÊåáÂ±±ÁµÑ) formed thick beds of sandstone. The total thickness is 0.9 to 1.2 km. The Yeliu Group from the Miocene is fine grained sandstone, with some beds of shale, basaltic tuff and three seams of coal. Possibly including Wushan Formation, Piling Shale, Peiliao Formation, Talu shale, Shihti Formation, Kuanyiongshan sandstone. The Ruifang Group contains beds of sandstone, siltstone, shale and six thin coal beds. These beds are 0.8 to 1.6 km thick. The Sangxia Group starts with medium grained sandstone, but in the upper layers increases shale. Eight thin coal seams are included. The total thickness of the deepest beds exceeds 5 km. This includes the Kueichulin Formation with the Yutengping Sandstone, Shihliufen Shale, Kuantaoshan Sandstone; the Nanchuang Formation including Shangfuchi Sandstone and Tungkeng Formation. The Jinshui Formation or Chinshui Formation from the Pliocene is mostly shale interbedded with some mudstone and sandstone is between 80 and 400 m thick. The Zhuolan Formation or Cholan Formation (ÂçìËò≠Â±§) starts in the Pliocene and extends into the first stage of the Pleistocene. It consists of fine grained sandstone. This is 1.5 to 2.5 km thick. At the same time on the southern tip of the island, the Kending Formation or Kenting Formation (Â¢æ‰∏ÅÁµÑ) was formed consisting of mudstone with ophiolite melange. The ophiolite melange contains pebbles and blocks of Miocene age consisting of basic and ultrabasic rock from the ocean floor. The interpretation is that a wedge of seafloor was pushed above sea level, eroded and dropped fragments into the mud. The Toukoshan Formation (Toukeshan) (È†≠ÂµôÂ±±Â±§) commenced with fine sandstone with thin beds of conglomerate, and continued into mainly conglomerate with sandstone beds. This was formed in stage 1 and 2 of the Pleistocene. It is from 0.4 to 3 km thick. The Szekou Formation is a light bluish gray siltstone, with shale and fine grained sandstone. The Maanshan Formation is very similar. It is overlain by Hengchun Limestone and may interfinger. Western piedmont region The Hengchun Limestone was formed after the Penglai movement in the third Pleistocene stage. Also at this time laterite (Á¥ÖÂúü) and gravel on river terraces was formed. Holocene mud sand and coral form a wide belt on the west side of the island. Volcanic rocks The Tatun Volcano Group is found on the northern tip of Taiwan. Chihsingshan is the highest point of the volcanoes at 1120 meters. The volcanoes have formed the rounded shape of the northern cape of Taiwan. The volcanic rock also occur on Huaping Isle, Mienhua Isle, Pengchia Isle and Huangwei Isle just to the north of Taiwan. The rocks are aluminium rich andesite, tuff and breccia. The rocks are poor in sodium and magnesium, but rich in iron, potassium, rubidium and strontium and strong in rare earth elements. The magma was derived by melting of the underthrust sea plate behind the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc during the Pleistocene. The Caolingshan Basalt consists of olivine and pyroxene, with crystals of biotite and plagioclase. This is rich in K, Rb, Mg, Sr, Cr, and Ni, but poor in Na, Al, and Fe. Rare earth elements are strongly enriched. The magma was derived by deep mantle melting of the underthrust sea plate behind the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc during the Pleistocene. The volcanoes on Chilungshan, Penshan, Caoshan, Chilung Island (Keelung Islet) and Gueishan Island date from the Pleistocene period and later. The eruption were explosive tholeiitic andesite and dacite. The main mineral is calcium rich plagioclase. The magma source is the western extremity of the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc formed when the subducting Philippines Sea Plate was compressed below the edge of the Eurasian Plate at about 20 to 30 km deep. The magma was contaminated with continental crust material. Geochemistry of the rock shows that iron, aluminium, titanium, potassium, rubidium and strontium are enriched, but sodium, magnesium and nickel are impoverished. Alkaline volcanic rocks from north west Taiwan are found at the Shihmen Reservoir, Chiaopanshan, Taoyuan and Fuxing. The rocks are picrite, alkaline basalt and trachyandesite. The commons minerals are albite, olivine, clinopyroxene and oxides of iron and titanium. The elements enriched are sodium and titanium, and magnesium and calcium are reduced. The rock dates from the Miocene. The magma was formed under tension conditions on the continental margin from deep down in the mantle. Volcanoes on the Coastal Range and Green Island erupted tholeiite andesite, and volcanic explosive fragments. The volcanoes erupted from the Pliocene to Pleistocene period. It is part of the Luzon Volcanic Arc. Magma was formed from subducting oceanic crust under compression about 25 km deep. The andesite rock contains some visible crystals of pyroxene or amphibole. The geochemistry of the rock shows it is enriched in potassium, strontium and rubidium and light rare earth elements. Chromium and nickel are depleted. The Chimei Volcanic Complex, near the Hsiukuluanchi River, has an age from 9 to 22.2 Ma. It is associated with copper porphyry mineralisation. It covers an area of 22 km2. Pleistocene basalt and tholeiite is found in the Penghu Islands. The lava erupted from fissures in a flood. The rock is enriched in titanium and poor in aluminium, rubidium and strontium. The alkaline basalt contains olivine and analcite. The tholeiite contains plagioclase and pyroxene. The magma originated in the upper mantle under tension conditions on the continental margin. Structures *Hengchun Valley syncline under the Hengchun Valley *Hengchun Fault on east side of Hengchun Valley. It extends along the Pintung Valley as the Chaochow fault and Laonungchi fault. *Kenting Park anticline is overturned and folds Miocene rocks of the Changlo Formation, Lushan Formation to the north. Loshui Formation is on the sides of the anticline. Tectonics The Philippines Sea Plate is converging with the continent at 7 cm per year in the west north west direction. It has compressed Cenozoic sediments by around 200 km in the last 4 Ma. The piled up sediment is rising into mountains at the rate of 5 mm per year. The major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various terranes. As a result, Taiwan has numerous mud volcanoes and hot springs. These faults have produced several major quakes throughout the history of the island, including the 1951 East Rift Valley earthquakes on the East Rift Valley (Ëä±Êù±Á∏±Ë∞∑) and 1964 Baihe earthquake on the Chukou Fault. The 1946 Hsinhua earthquake ruptured the Hsinhua fault (Êñ∞ÂåñÊñ∑Â±§). The most lethal was 1935 Hsinchu-Taichung earthquake shifting on a fault at Emei Township, Hsinchu County. The second deadliest was a 7.3 quake that ruptured the Chelongpu Fault (ËªäÁ±†ÂüîÊñ∑Â±§) on 21 September 1999, known as the \\"921 earthquake\\". On 4 March 2010 at about 01:20 UTC, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake hit southern Taiwan. The seismic hazard map for Taiwan by the USGS shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating (most hazardous). Offshore The offshore features include the Kaoping Slope extending off the southwest coast of Taiwan into the South China Sea. This is emerging from the sea over time to extend the island. The Henchung Ridge extends south from the Hengchun Peninsula (ÊÅÜÊò•ÂçäÂ≥∂), and is the submarine part of the Central Range. The Southern Longitudinal Trough is the southern underwater extension of the Longitudinal Valley. The Huatang Ridge extends south off the coast from Taitung City. The Taitung Trough lies to the east behind the Luzon Arc. The Luzon Arc comes to the surface on the islands of L√ºdao and Lanyu. A submarine canyon, the Taitung Canyon, cuts through the arc between the two islands linking the Taitung Trough to the Huatung Basin. The canyon cuts across the Huatung Basin bending to the north and reaching the Ryukyu Trench. A 5.5 magnitude earthquake struck at 08:00 GMT on 20 March 2011, near the canyon breaking segments C and D of the East Asia Crossing undersea cable. The Huatung Basin lies east of Taiwan south of the city of Hualien. It extends west till the Gagua Ridge about 110 km offshore. The Taiwan Banks are a shallow part of the main continental shelf off mainland China lying to the south and south west of Penghu Islands. The Taixinan Basin (Âè∞Ë•øÂçóÁõÜÂú∞) is located between Taiwan Banks and the Central Mountains. The Okinawa Trough, the back-arc basin behind the Ryukyu Islands, shows up on the coastline as a bay between Dome Point north to Sanshokiaku (easternmost point of Taiwan) (24.6¬∞ to 25¬∞N). Geophysics Taiwan has a very strong, positive Bouguer gravity anomaly in the Coastal Range, at over +4x10‚àí4 ms‚àí2. A local low below -2x10‚àí4 ms‚àí2 is on the western side centered near Zhoulan.Geology of China page 62 The gravity low is due to a mass deficit in the Taiwan Strait which is a flexural basin. Positive magnetic variations are found in narrow strips, west-southwest oriented of the west coast, and east-northeast off the northern coast, and south-north offshore from the Coastal Range heading south. These are of the order of 200 nT.Geology of China page 66 The Crustal thickness is around 30 km, with over 2 km of thickening under the Central Range, and thinning off the east coast. Taiwan is on the edge of the continental shelf, so the thickness of the crust is constant through the Taiwan Strait to the mainland. Heat flow is greatest to west of the Longitudinal Valley at rates exceeding 240 mWm‚àí2. Hydrology Beitou hot spring valley Many of the rocks in Taiwan have low pore space and have little ground water. There are several hot springs in Taiwan, with most around the northern volcanic region. The Chingshui geothermal region is named after the Cingshuei River 13 km south west of Yilan. Rivers in Taiwan transport a large amount of sediment to the sea. The south end of the Longitudonal Valley discharges the Peinan River with 88,000,000 tons of sediment per year. East flowing rivers move 17, 15 31 and 22 megatons per year of sediment. The Cho Shiu shifts 54 MT per year. Rivers running south from the Central Range move over 100 MT of sediment per year. Study =Mapping= The first geological map of Taiwan was made in 1898 by Y. Ishii titled A Map of Geology and Mineral Resources of the Island of Taiwan. It was at a scale of 1:800,000 and showed six items in its legend. Japan needed oil and coal for the war against Russia in 1904, so study began on the coal fields in the north part of Taiwan, more detailed maps were made, and the next one was published in 1911 by Y. Deguchi and G. Hosoya at a scale of 1:300,000. A third map was produced in 1926 titled: Geological Map of Taiwan showing Mineral Distribution by Y. Ichikawa and H. Takahashi. It showed 19 rock units. A 1935 coloured map by Y. Ichikawa had a scale of 1:500,000. In 1953 the Geological Survey of Taiwan (Âè∞ÁÅ£Âú∞Ë≥™Ë™øÊü•ÊâÄ) published a map compiled by L.S. Chang at a 1:300,000 scale. A 1974 map had two scales 1:250,000 and 1:500,000. A second edition was printed in 1986 along with notes.

Vacancy The election was caused by the resignation of J. Batty Langley, due to long-term ill health.\\"Labour Candidate Returned\\", Evening Post, 6 May 1909 He had been the Liberal Party Member of Parliament for the seat since an 1894 by-election. Electoral history Batty Langley had been re-elected unopposed at the 1895 and 1900 general elections. Arnold Muir Wilson, a local Conservative Party councillor and honorary consul for Serbia had contested the seat in 1906, taking 46.8% of the vote.J. H. Stainton, The Making of Sheffield 1865-1914Slobodan G. Markovich, Perceptions of Serbia and the Balkans in the British Press, p.108 Batty Langley Background Attercliffe, a district of north east Sheffield, was a heavy industry, working class area. At the time of the election, there was extremely high unemployment in the area.\\"Labour wins a by-election\\", Feilding Star, 6 May 1909, p.3 Candidates R.C. Lambert The Liberal Party approached Arthur Neal, then a local councillor, but he declined nomination. Only one candidate then put themselves forward for nomination: Richard Cornthwaite Lambert, a London-based barrister who had narrowly failed to win Sheffield Ecclesall at the 1906 election.\\"Sheffield Election: the Liberal Candidate\\", Manchester Guardian, 19 April 1909 Muir Wilson As Muir Wilson, the Conservative candidate last time, was out of the country, the Conservatives nominated a new candidate, Sydney Charles King-Farlow. A newcomer to politics, he was a barrister based in the south east of England.The Colonial Office List (1949), p.538 Wilson objected to the decision to stand an outsider, and decided to stand as an independent candidate. He was adopted by an unofficial panel of Conservative Party members, and offered to withdraw if the party apologised to him, withdrew King-Farlow and instead adopted a candidate of his choice. This offer was not accepted.\\"Conservative candidature in Attercliffe division\\", Manchester Guardian, 8 April 1909 Joseph Pointer The Labour Party asked President of the Yorkshire Miners' Association Herbert Smith to stand, but he declined. Instead, they stood Joseph Pointer, Chair of Sheffield Trades Council and a local councillor. He was a member of the Independent Labour Party and the United Patternmakers Association, but both organisations initially refused to sponsor his candidacy, the Patternmakers finally agreeing on 20 April to finance him. Campaign The campaign was short, but hard- fought. Lambert campaigned as \\"the People's Candidate\\", opposing taxes on food. He described himself as a radical, and announced that he would not say a word of apology or in defence of the government, but that its conduct had been admirable. Muir Wilson stood on a protectionist platform, under the slogan \\"Vote for the Tory Chicken!! Kill the London Cuckoo!!\\". Surprisingly for a Conservative, he called for the redistribution of wealth and the nationalisation of railways and collieries. King-Farlow promised \\"more work for Englishmen and less work for foreigners\\". The two engaged in a widely discussed dispute, Muir Wilson writing to King-Farlow \\"I think you have found out by now how you have been fooled and betrayed, so you have better throw the sponge up and return to London\\".\\"Widening rift in Conservative camp\\", Manchester Guardian, 20 April 1909 The two held rival meetings a few feet apart in Heeley, and Muir Wilson attacked local Conservative MP Samuel Roberts for appearing on King-Farlow's platform. Roberts called Muir Wilson a \\"mountebank\\", but subsequently suggested that the party should withdraw their candidate and apologise to Muir Wilson. Other Tories advocated both candidates standing down in favour of Fred Kelley, a local brewer, but he stated that he would not stand even if asked.\\"Sheffield election: Lively scenes between rival Conservatives\\", Manchester Guardian, 28 April 1909 Ramsay MacDonald, Keir Hardie and Arthur Henderson, among others, came to campaign for Pointer. His campaign was criticised for being poorly organised, and suffered from a lack of resources, being largely based on open air speeches.\\"Sheffield election: The Labour candidate returned\\", Manchester Guardian, 5 May 1909 At the end of April, Captain Hunnable, an eccentric poet from Ilford,Geoffrey Jules Marcus, Before the Lamps Went Out, p.50 arrived in the constituency, promising to raise wages to ¬£2 a week and form a government within five years. He considered supporting Muir Wilson, but rejected the idea after a meeting, and briefly attempted to stand as a fifth candidate,\\"More scenes with Mr Muir Wilson\\", Manchester Guardian, 30 April 1909 but gave up after he divined a horoscope stating the Muir Wilson would win.\\"What Mr Muir Wilson wishes\\", Manchester Guardian, 1 May 1909 The Women's Social and Political Union intervened in the election, with Emmeline Pankhurst speaking. The organisation was broadly sympathetic to the Labour Party, but all four candidates endorsed women's suffrage. However, they were pelted with rotten eggs and vegetables during at least one open-air meeting, and appealed for police protection.\\"Attercliffe election: Women suffragists' appeal for police protection\\", Manchester Guardian, 24 April 1909 During the campaign, they collected 5,000 signatures from local voters to a petition to enfranchise women. The Manchester Guardian predicted that Lambert would win easily, taking at least 5,000 votes, with eight or nine thousand shared between the other three candidates. Result The result was announced on a large illuminated screen at Sheffield Town Hall, and a big crowd awaited the result of the contest. With the Conservative vote split, Pointer was able to take enough votes from the Liberals to achieve a narrow victory, with the Liberals dropping from first to third place. With only 27.5% of the vote, this remains the lowest ever winning share in a single-member by-election. At the time, the possibility of winning a seat with such a low share of the vote was described by the Daily Chronicle as an \\"absurdity\\", making the case for preferential voting. The Labour gain, and the dramatic fall in the Liberal vote, encouraged David Lloyd George to move the party to the left, and the next months saw a series of large Liberal victories in their safe seats.W. D. Rubinstein, Twentieth-century Britain: a political history, p.37 On 22 May, Winston Churchill spoke in favour of the introduction of proportional representation, claiming that \\"the present system has clearly broken down. The results produced are not fair to any party... all they secure is fluke representation\\".John H. Humphreys and A. B. Poland, Proportional Representation A Study In Methods Of Election, p.71 Immediately after the announcement, Muir Wilson thanked Pointer and Lambert, but accused King-Farlow of being \\"warped by the prejudice of others\\". Later in the evening, King- Farlow confronted him, calling him a \\"cad and a liar\\", and the two Conservatives had to be separated. The following week, Muir Wilson called a public meeting, at which he complained that he had spent ¬£1,100 on contesting the 1906 and 1909 elections, and \\"if that is not enough to buy the seat of Attercliffe, I don't know what is\\".\\"Mr Muir Wilson and his opponents\\", Manchester Guardian, 8 May 1909 Later in the month, he sued King-Farlow for assault on the election night, and for damage to his bowler hat.\\"Sheffield by- election litigation\\", Manchester Guardian, 18 May 1909 The case was dismissed before Muir Wilson was able to give evidence.\\"Mr. Muir Wilson\\", Manchester Guardian, 4 October 1909 Aftermath Pointer held the seat until his death in 1914. Lambert finally won a seat at Cricklade in 1910. Wilson died a few months after the by-election, without ever having returned to the UK. King- Farlow contested the seat again in January 1910, then stood in Hackney South in December, but was never elected, and instead became a judge in British East Africa.

Artist and historian Giorgio Vasari expressed his admiration for the palace, stating that it was pieno [...] di capricciose invenzioni (\\"full of capricious inventions\\"). At the time, the palace also housed a notable collection of art works and antiquities, which has been dispersed over time. According to an inventory dating back to 1615, it had paintings by Titian, Parmigianino, and Michelangelo; the inventory also mentions a book of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, which scholars identify with the Codex Atlanticus now preserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana.Casa degli Omenoni a Milano The palace has been largely restored and restructured in the 19th and 20th century; only the facade has remained almost unchanged, except for the addition of iron balconies and of the attic. After being owned by Leone Leoni and then by his son Pompeo Leoni, the house was sold by Pompeo's son-in-law Polidoro Calchi, and over time was owned by several notable Milanese families, including the Belgioioso, the Pozzi, and the Besana. It was also used as the seat of the music-publishing company Casa Ricordi, as a seat of the Fascist party, and as a theatre. The building is adjacent to the Palazzo Pozzi Besana.

Neolloydia mariposensis, Sclerocactus mariposensis) is a rare species of cactus known by the common names Lloyd's fishhook cactus, golfball cactus, silver column cactus, and Mariposa cactus. It is native to a small section of territory straddling the border between Brewster County, Texas, in the United States and the state of Coahuila in Mexico. It has been federally listed as a threatened species in the United States since 1979.USFWS. E. mariposensis Recovery Plan. April 1990. Habitat This tiny cactus grows at about 30 sites in Texas and Coahuila, many of which are located within Big Bend National Park and the Black Gap Wildlife Management Area.E. mariposensis. Center for Plant Conservation.E. mariposensis. Texas Parks and Wildlife. In Coahuila it has been observed near Cuatro Ci√©negas and Monclova. It is named for the Mariposa Mine, a mercury mine in Texas, where it was first discovered. It was described in 1945. The plant grows in Chihuahuan Desert scrub amongst other plants such as beaked yucca (Yucca rostrata), creosote (Larrea tridentata), and lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), as well as many other cacti. It grows in barren, exposed, rocky habitat with substrates of limestone; it does not occur in the adjacent parts of the habitat where the rock is gypsum, and the related Echinomastus warnockii fills its niche there.E. mariposensis. Flora of North America. This cactus may grow alongside the bunched cory cactus (Coryphantha ramillosa), another threatened cactus species. Characteristics This is a petite cactus growing up to 10 centimeters tall by 6 wide. The body is covered with areoles bearing spines. The central spines are up to 2 centimeters long and are white, gray, or yellow in color with brownish or bluish tips. Each areole also has many radial spines which are smaller and white or gray in color, sometimes with brown tips. The flowers are white, or pink fading to white over time, often with dark midstripes, and up to 3 centimeters long. The fruit is about a centimeter in length and yellow-green in color. Blooming occurs in February and March. Endangered status Threats to this rare species have included mercury mining, petroleum exploration activities, off-road vehicles, and grazing. The worst threat has been poaching by cactus collectors. The collectors employed professional diggers to go into the habitat and retrieve this and other species of cacti, which were stockpiled, shipped away for sale, and sometimes discarded or wasted. The type locality of the cactus has been scoured for specimens and few are found there anymore. Plants in Big Bend National Park occur on rugged terrain and have generally been safe from collectors. In 1983 the cactus was placed on Appendix 1 of CITES in an effort to protect it from harvesting.

On the Finnmark mountain plateau Race profile Offroad Finnmark Photo: Steinar Vik The race offers the ultimate terrain challenge, as the riders use GPS navigation to find their way across Finnmark's mountain plateau. Offroad Finnmark consists of two different races:of700 - our toughest challenge - a 700 km team competition and of300 - a 300 km team competition. From 2016 the shorter of150 is also an Offroad Finnmark - race. The 700 km long one-stage race is based on rugged outback, arctic scenery, and the midnight sun making it possible to complete a long one-stage pursuit. The Offroad Finnmark pursuit is a one-stage race as well, being a bit more accessible to teams consisting of more participants than just international winners. Though shorter than the of700, the of300 is a demanding ultra marathon offering higher speeds chase yet still retaining some of the most stunning wilderness the Arctic has to offer. Categories Due to safety reasons, of300/700 and of150-junir is a team race. Teams must contain 2-3 riders. There are: *men's teams *women's teams *mixed teams The of150 offers two races with normal age classes: of150 solo and of150 fatbike Participants Offroad Finnmark is such a challenge that all teams are subject to individual scrutiny, every applicant is deemed fit or not fit to complete the race they've applied for by offroadfinnmark's board.

It was founded by Don Monro. The Really Big Chorus gathers three times a year at the Royal Albert Hall. The flagship event is Messiah from Scratch that attracts over 3,000 singers, and there are also weekends in European cities and leisurely cruises. Any singer can take part and there are no auditions, but singers are expected to learn the music in advance. The first concert was Messiah from Scratch, performed at the Royal Albert Hall in 1974. The conductor was Gavin Park. In 1979, the fifth anniversary of Messiah from Scratch, Park's research took him on sabbatical to the USA. David Willcocks was approached and agreed to conduct. Park gracefully deferred and played cello in the orchestra until his early death from cancer. From this point Messiah from Scratch became an event organised primarily for the benefit of choral singers, and the roster of works performed at the Royal Albert Hall grew. By the end of the 1990s, Requiems by Brahms, Mozart, Faur√© and Verdi were taking their place alongside performances of Orff's Carmina Burana, Elgar's Dream of Gerontius and Vivaldi's Gloria. In 1993, following David Willcocks' advice, Don Monro decided to lift the standard of performances even further by employing a professional orchestra. The English Festival Orchestra (founded by Trevor Ford) was already known to Sir David through its work with the Leith Hill Musical Festival of which Sir David was the president. At a summer event in 1999, The Really Big Chorus gave the first performances of Sing!, a new composition by Sir David, a choral setting of his own words to Widor's Toccata, which was played on the Royal Albert Hall organ by Jane Watts, with additional material for the orchestra. The concert marked Sir David's 50th performance with TRBC. In May 2010, a Scratch Celebration Concert for Sir David Willcocks was held as he conducted his final concert for The Really Big Chorus. Guest speaker was Brian Kay and special guests were the Choir of Kings' College Cambridge, conducted by Stephen Cleobury. The Really Big Chorus first worked with Brian Kay in July 2005, in a performance of Carmina Burana. In November 2010, he conducted his first Messiah from Scratch. Kay has now been appointed principal conductor. In July 2010 TRBC singers performed the world premiere of Karl Jenkins' Gloria, a work commissioned by The Really Big Chorus. His work The Armed Man had been performed at the Royal Albert Hall by TRBC in July 2008. On 11 September 2011, Karl conducted TRBC singers in a memorial concert of The Armed Man at the Avery Fisher Hall (part of the Lincoln Center), New York. A second commission from Karl Jenkins, Gods of Olympus, inspired by the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, had its first performance at the Royal Albert Hall in July 2012. 2014 was the 40th anniversary of The Really Big Chorus, and another choral work was commissioned, this time from the composer Jonathan Willcocks (son of Sir David, mentioned above). The work, entitled In Praise of Singing (for soprano and baritone soloists, chorus and symphony orchestra) was commissioned by Don Monro and will receive its first performance on 13 July 2014. Sadly, Don Monro will not hear it, as he died on 25 May 2014 after a year-long battle with cancer.

When Cyprus became a member of the European Union in 2004, CySEC simultaneously became a part of the European MiFID regulation, giving firms registered in Cyprus access to all European markets. However, joining the EU and adopting the Euro significantly changed the financial regulatory framework that CySEC policed for what had been previously considered a tax haven.Naked Capitalism: Repeat After Me, Cyprus Is (Was) Not a Tax Haven On May 4, 2012, CySEC announced a policy change regarding the classification of binary options as financial instruments. The effect was that binary options platforms operating in Cyprus (where most of the platforms are based) had to be regulated. This established CySEC as the first financial regulator to globally recognise and regulate binary options as financial instruments. Nicosia financial district Responsibilities CySEC has the following responsibilities: # To supervise and control the operation of the Cyprus Stock Exchange and the transactions carried out in the Stock Exchange, its listed companies, brokers and brokerage firms. # To supervise and control Licensed Investment Services Companies, Collective Investment funds, investment consultants and mutual fund management companies. # To grant operation licences to investment firms, including investment consultants, brokerage firms and brokers. # To impose administrative sanctions and disciplinary penalties to brokers, brokerage firms, investment consultants as well as to in any other legal or natural person whom fall under the provisions of the Stock Market legislation. In a recent amendment to the Law governing CySEC and its responsibility it has received significant power over the entities that it regulates in that it may carry out investigations, enter premises and search as well as to share any findings with foreign regulators Structure CySEC is administrated by a five-member Board which is composed of the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman, that are employed full-time, plus three other members.

She came to prominence when she sued her employers for unfair dismissal after she lost her job following her attempts to expose sex trafficking in Bosnia. Her story was shown in the film The Whistleblower and told in the nonfiction book, The Whistleblower, with journalist Cari Lynn. Bosnia Bolkovac left the Lincoln Police Department in 1999 and signed a contract with DynCorp Aerospace, a British subsidiary of US based DynCorp International. DynCorp had a $15 million UN-related contract to hire and train police officers for duty in Bosnia. After a week at the companies training facility in Fort Worth, Texas, Bolkovac was sent to Sarajevo, Bosnia where she worked as a human rights investigator for three months. She was then moved to a Zenica, 70 kilometers north of Sarajevo to work on a specialist case aimed at fighting violence against women. In July 2001, Bolkovac filed a lawsuit in Great Britain against DynCorp for unfair dismissal after a protected disclosure (whistleblowing). They had claimed she was fired for falsifying time sheets. On August 2, 2002 the tribunal unanimously found in her favour. She reported that fellow DynCorp officers were paying for prostitutes, raping underage girls and participating in sex trafficking. While locals were prosecuted, any UN contractors involved had immunity from prosecution in Bosnia, though a number of these officers were forced to resign and leave Bosnia, under suspicion of illegal activity. Madeleine Rees, Head of Office in the region for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, testified in her support. In November 2002, an employment tribunal ordered DynCorp to pay Bolkovac ¬£110,221 in damages. She stated that the case settlement ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt really even cover expenses‚Äù. The US government continued their contract with DynCorp.  Later career and activism  In 2015 Bolkovac graduated with a degree in political science from University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln. She has continued to work against human trafficking and violence against women, and is a public speaker addressing the trafficking, ethics and anti-corruption issues. Bolkovac has stated that she doesn‚Äôt consider herself an activist but ‚Äúmore of an advocate for change‚Äú. She designed and taught a masters level course at the University for Peace. In 2020 she began working on launching a human rights curriculum for middle and high school students. In 2015 she was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.  Personal life  Bolkovac has three children from her first marriage, two daughters and a son. In 1999 she married her second husband, Jan, a police officer for the Dutch government, whom she worked with in Bosnia. She lives in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Amsterdam. Media Bolkovac's story was made into a film, The Whistleblower, released in 2010. Following a film screening of The Whistleblower, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened a panel discussion on sexual exploitation and abuse in conflict and post-conflict situations.United Nations webcast: Panel discussion: Sexual exploitation and abuse in conflict and post-conflict situations The film maker and senior UN officials addressed issues raised in the film, including human trafficking and forced prostitution as well as the organisation's effort to combat sexual exploitation of women and children.

Unlike \\"normal\\" naloxone, (+)-naloxone has no significant affinity for opioid receptors, but instead has been discovered to act as a selective antagonist of Toll-like receptor 4. This receptor is involved in immune system responses, and activation of TLR4 induces glial activation and release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-Œ± and Interleukin-1. Relation of TLR4 to opioid drugs Both \\"normal\\" and \\"unnatural\\" enantiomers of various opioid analgesic drugs including morphine, meperidine, fentanyl, methadone and buprenorphine, as well as some otherwise inactive metabolites like morphine-3-glucuronide, have been found to act as agonists of TLR4, and chronic use of these drugs consequently causes constant low-level release of TNF-Œ± and IL-1Œ≤ as well as other downstream effects. This is thought to be involved in various adverse properties of opioid analgesic drugs, such as loss of efficacy with extended use and the associated development of tolerance and dependence, as well as the development of side effects such as hyperalgesia and allodynia, which can cause long-term use of opioid analgesics to not only fail to treat neuropathic pain, but ultimately exacerbate it. Applications of (+)-naloxone and related drugs Several opioid antagonist drugs were found to act as antagonists for TLR4, including naloxone and naltrexone. However it was found that not only the \\"normal\\" (-) enantiomers, but also the \\"unnatural\\" (+) enantiomers of these drugs acted as TLR4 antagonists (though (+)-nalmefene was inactive). Since (+)-naloxone and (+)-naltrexone lack affinity for opioid receptors, they do not block the effects of opioid analgesic drugs, and so can be used to counteract the TLR4-mediated side effects of opioid agonists without affecting analgesia, though (+)-naloxone does reduce the reinforcing effects of opioid drugs. (+)-Naloxone was also found to be neuroprotective, and both (+)-naloxone and (+)-naltrexone are effective in their own right at treating symptoms of neuropathic pain in animal models. However (+)-naloxone was also found to reduce the effects of stimulant drugs, suggesting additional actions beyond TLR4 antagonism (possibly as a sigma receptor antagonist), that might potentially result in unwanted side effects or drug interactions.

The fern grows at one location, where there are 22 known specimens. It was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 1993.USFWS. Recovery Plan for Puerto Rican Endangered Ferns (7 spp.). January 1995. The fern was described in 1947 from specimens found at Monte Jayuya. This habitat was cleared for construction and the plant was extirpated. It was later located on Cerro de Punta. This fern is an epiphyte which grows on the trunks of the tree species Lyonia rubiginosa var. stahlii. There are only six trees that together host the 22 ferns. This mountain summit is coveted for its ideal location for communications facilities and construction of these facilities has led to destruction of part of the forest there.USFWS. 3 Puerto Rican Ferns: Five-year Review. January 2010. This fern produces a few fronds of two different types. The sterile frond is up to 19 centimeters long with a blade at the end measuring up to 8 centimeters long by 3.5 wide. The fertile frond is up to 18 centimeters long and has a smaller blade, up to 4 centimeters long and only about a centimeter wide. The fern grows on mossy tree trunks in the elfin forest on the highest peak on the island of Puerto Rico. This cloud forest has a short, dense canopy no more than about 7 meters tall. It is very wet, windy, and has saturated soils poor in nutrients. Because this plant is known from only one location, habitat destruction or disturbance in that area could result in the extinction of the species. The mountain peak was strongly impacted by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Many permits have been requested by entities interested in building structures in the area, an activity that has caused plant destruction in the past.

Culture The culture has been referred to as the Abu Madi Entity as it shows evidence of having retained Natufian characteristics of a temporary settlement, while being at least partly contemporary with the PPNA cultures of the Levant further to the North. It has been dated approximately 10100 to 9700 BP or from between 9660 to 9180 BC with calibrated datings ranging between c. 9750 and 7760 BC. Judging by these radiocarbon dates, Abu Madi has been suggested to be a form of late Khiamian culture. It has been suggested that the dwellings found housed small groups of nuclear families continuing in the Natufian style.

He held the posts of Minister of War in the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod cabinet (December 1919 ‚Äì March 1920), Minister of Communications and of Industry and Commerce in the Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu cabinet (January 1922 ‚Äì March 1926). Early life Mo»ôoiu was born in 1868 in the village √öjtoh√°n/Tohanul Nou, at the time in Austria-Hungary, now part of ZƒÉrne»ôti, Bra»ôov County. He went to the Andrei »òaguna High School in Bra»ôov, then studied at the Ludovica Academy in Budapest and the Theresian Military Academy in Vienna. He graduated from the latter academy on June 1, 1889 with the rank of second lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian Army, and was sent to the Sibiu garrison. Career in the Romanian Army In 1891, Mo»ôoiu moved to Romania and joined the Romanian Army ranks. He commanded companies in the 9th Regiment Romana»õi (1901‚Äì1904) and the 9th Battalion V√¢nƒÉtori in Ploie»ôti, the 1st Infantry Battalion of the 30th Regiment Muscel, the 6th Regiment Mihai Viteazul in Bucharest, and the 7th Battalion V√¢nƒÉtori in Gala»õi. He saw action in the military campaign in Bulgaria during the Second Balkan War and on October 1, 1913, he was appointed commander of the 30th Regiment V√¢nƒÉtori at C√¢mpulung, holding the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. World War I King Ferdinand saluting the Royal Guards at the Carei train station (1919) Romania was neutral for the first two years of World War I, entering on the side of the Allied powers on 27 August 1916. The start of the war found Mo»ôoiu as commanding officer of 2nd Regiment V√¢lcea and commander of the military group assigned to the Olt‚ÄìLotru sector, when he played a decisive role in the Nagyszeben Offensive. From 26‚Äì29 September his units fought tenaciously in the Olt Valley with the 1st Army Corps led by General David Praporgescu, blocking an attempted breakthrough of the 9th German Army under the command of Erich von Falkenhayn. During the Romanian Campaign of 1916 he commanded the 3rd Infantry Brigade and then the 23rd Infantry Division. In January 1917 he was promoted to brigadier general and put in command of the 12th Infantry Division. For his bravery during the Battle of Transylvania in the fall of 1916 he was awarded on 2 January 1918 the Order of Michael the Brave, 3rd Class. On 3 March 1918, after the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks signed a separate peace with the Central Powers in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Romania was alone on the Eastern Front, a situation that far surpassed its military capabilities; therefore, on 7 May 1918, Romania sued for peace. On 10 November 1918 Romania re-entered the war on the side of the Allies. King Ferdinand called for the mobilization of the Romanian army and ordered it to attack by crossing the Carpathian Mountains into Transylvania. The end of World War I that soon followed did not bring an end to fighting for the Romanian army; its mission continued into 1918 and 1919 in the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War. The Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War of 1919: Romanian advance to the Tisza Generals and Mo»ôoiu during the crossing of the Tisza Bran On 1 December 1918, the Union of Transylvania with Romania was officiated by the elected representatives of the Romanian people of Transylvania. Later that month, Romanian units reached the line of the Mure»ô River, which was the demarcation line agreed upon by the representatives of the Allied powers and Hungary. On 10 December, a unified command of the Romanian army in Transylvania was established; its headquarters were at Sibiu, with Mo»ôoiu in command. On 12 March 1919 he was appointed Military Governor of Transylvania. On 21 March B√©la Kun led a successful communist coup d'√©tat in Hungary; he formed a social democratic, communist coalition government and proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic. General Gheorghe MƒÉrdƒÉrescu was in command of the Romanian army in Transylvania, with General Mo»ôoiu in command of the Army Group North. By 18 April, the first elements of the Romanian offensive were completed and the Hungarian front was broken. Mo»ôoiu's troops took control of western Transylvania, including the cities of »òimleu Silvaniei, Beiu»ô, and Oradea by 20 April, and then Salonta, Carei, and Satu Mare, pressing on to the Tisza River. The Hungarian forces retreated to Szolnok and from there across the Tisza, establishing two concentric defense lines. Between 29 April and 1 May, the Romanian Army broke through these lines, establishing control on the entire east bank of the Tisza. On 2 May, Hungary sued for peace, with Kun prepared to recognize all of Romania's territorial demands. General Mo»ôoiu became the governor of the military district between the Romanian border and the Tisza River. After repelling attacks by the Hungarian Army in July 1919, the Romanian Army crossed the Tisza River at the end of the month and advanced towards Budapest. On 2 August, Kun fled Hungary towards the Austrian border and eventually reached the Soviet Union. On 3‚Äì4 August some 400 Romanian soldiers with two artillery guns took hold of the city. Soon after, the bulk of the Romanian troops arrived in the Budapest and a parade was held through the city center in front of their commander, General Mo»ôoiu. Romanian forces continued their advance into Hungary, stopping at Gy≈ër; they occupied all of Hungary with the exception of an area around Lake Balaton. Mo»ôoiu was named commander of the Romanian military garrison in Budapest and Military Governor of the Hungarian territory to the west of the Tisza River. After the War In December 1919 he retired from the Army, joined the National Liberal Party, and was named Minister of War in the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod cabinet, serving in this position until March 1920. Mo»ôoiu died in Bucharest on 15 August 1932. He is buried at Bellu Cemetery, in Bucharest. On the 75th anniversary of his death, a bust of Mo»ôoiu was erected in Bran, Bra»ôov County in 2007; the inaugural ceremony was attended by then-President Traian BƒÉsescu.

The group is divided into two divisions, Nokas Cash Handling and Nokas Security. This is according to the CEO Heine Wang: \\"The Group is in a European market. We established operations in Sweden in 2008 and Denmark in this year. It was therefore necessary to have a stronger name.

Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, whose sons' portraits had also appeared in the magazine, and who had knowledge of Broadley's reputation in India, took offence at his inclusion. After making enquiries at Scotland Yard, the magazine's owner Edmund Yates dismissed Broadley, and published an apology. Broadley was told to leave the country within 12 hours. The reason was not just the earlier scandal in India: Broadley was implicated as a client of the male brothel at the centre of the Cleveland Street Scandal.

Broadley was placed under police surveillance. In 1891 he was reported to be 'loafing' in Tunis with fellow Cleveland Street exile Lord Arthur Somerset. Broadley's ability to reinvent himself provoked a mockingly Wildean paragraph in a British syndicated newspaper column in 1892, which stated that in Brussels he had \\"renewed his youth\\" and was: > ...in the widest sense \\"a new man\\". He in fact insists that he is a > disconnected and different Mr Broadley altogether from the gentleman whose > adventures while in the service of the Indian Prison department finally > excited so much curiosity in London; denies that there was ever such a > person as himself, that his portrait ever appeared in Vanity Fair, or that > an exalted personage ever intervened fiercely in his affairs.

In April 1896 Broadley met the serial financial fraudster Ernest Terah Hooley,The Affairs of Mr E.T., Daily News (London, England), Wednesday, 17 August 1898 and subsequently worked to promote his investment schemes.

Hooley purchased Anmer Hall estate, adjoining Sandringham in 1896. Through an intermediary the Prince of Wales requested that he be allowed to purchase the estate from Hooley, ostensibly for his daughter Maud, to which Hooley agreed. It has been alleged that the real reason for the Prince's action was to avoid the possibility of Broadley becoming a constant visitor to the estate, and hence near-neighbour. In 1898, Hooley was made bankrupt. In the Bankruptcy Court, Broadley appeared with Earl de la Warr and two other gentlemen. They were charged with contempt of court in attempting to bribe Hooley to alter his testimony to protect the Earl. Broadley was found guilty of insubordination and perjury and ordered to pay costs.The Hooley Case,Otago Witness (New Zealand), Issue 2328, 13 October 1898, Page 55, http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d;=OW18981013.2.232 Public opinion considered the treatment of Broadley by the judge very lenient.The Spectator, 20 August 1898, p2, http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/20th-august-1898/2/on-tuesday-mr- justice-wright-heard-the-evidence-in \\"Broadley made a beautiful witness\\", one report suggested, \\"brimming over with benevolence and pathos.

The reply was that they did apply, but that he had no other information on the matter.House of Commons, The Standard (London, England), Friday, 5 August 1898; pg. 2; Issue 23121 Broadley was denounced by Robert Wright, Justice of the Court of the Queen's Bench, as the real author and organiser of Hooley's deceitful schemes, but escaped bankruptcy and fashioned himself as a country gentleman. He retreated to his home village of Bradpole, Dorset, building a picturesque towered mansion, The Knapp.  Last years  The last fifteen years of Broadley's life were devoted to writing and book collecting, Napoleon and his age being at the heart of it, but also a large collection of works on criminal jurisprudence.Childers, Hugh Romantic Trials of Three Centuries, John Lane The Bodley Head, 1912; https://archive.org/stream/romantictrialsof00chiluoft/romantictrialsof00chiluoft_djvu.txt He made significant acquisitions of manuscript material, accumulating original letters and documents, as his book Chats on Autographs related.Broadley, A.

In 1906 he even penned a work on the boyhood of his nemesis Edward VII titled The Boyhood of a Great King. It drew at least one scathing review under the headline 'Scissors and Snobbery' which stated: \\"this stitching together of stale tattle from the Royal nursery may be 'good business': it is not an undertaking which enlists our sympathy.

By the time of his death, Broadley's crimes had been largely forgotten, and his obituary in The Times and those elsewhere made no mention of them. This prompted novelist and U.S. newspaper columnist Marguerite Cunliffe-Owen to restate them with the observation: \\"Of course all this is old and forgotten, and if I recall it, it is merely in order to show how very unreliable obituaries are apt to be, and the facility with which even such men as Broadley, if possessed of sufficient cleverness, and of impudence, are able to blind their citizens to their past infamies and to die in the odor of respectability, if not of sanctity\\" Legacy In his will, Broadley left the sum of ¬£8,506, the majority bequeathed to his nephew Lieutenant R.A.L.

Though his patience must have been sometimes sorely tried by vitriolic attacks made on it, often by persons whose knowledge of it was scant, he was almost always courteous to its critics, and such was the regard in which his transparent sincerity was held, that never were attacks made personally on him.'

This remark is expanded with the comment that 'Manning always insisted, with some passion, that scientific detachment [in his academic role] did not, and must not, mean refusal to commit oneself to causes in the political area, when laboratory coat and academic gown are doffed, and Manning did commit himself to at least one such cause, that of South Africa and its regime. But scientific inquiry and political partisanship were at all times rigidly separated from each other in his mind, and only linked in so far as the political partisan, the committed voter in a democratic election or the professional politician, enact their chosen roles the better after serving their time as non-partisan students of the world in which their partisanship subsequently does its work.'F.S.

Although he had only just turned 23 when he started out at Geelong during the 1980 VFL season, Taylor was already a multiple \\"Best and Fairest\\" winner for Southport. He was suspended after his debut, for two games, having been found guilty of striking South Melbourne's Michael Wright with a clenched first.The Age, \\"Cat recruit strikes out\\", 1 April 1980. P. 47 The suspension was costly as he was out of the seniors for seven weeks but when he returned he became a regular member of the team for the rest of the season. He played just six games in 1981 but appeared in a preliminary final, his second in two years. Taylor returned to Southport during the 1983 VFL season and finished equal first in voting for the Grogan Medal, but was ineligible due to suspension. He however won the award in 1985 and would go on to captain Southport to three premierships. His 26 interstate appearance for Queensland is a record and the medal given to the best player for the state in interstate matches is now named after him. He enjoyed considerable team success over the course of his career, playing in 16 grand finals in a 16 year period from 1975 to 1990. The sequence started with four premierships at Southport, while they were in the Gold Coast league. He then played in three successive premierships with the Geelong reserves team from 1980 to 1982, contributing six goals to their 1981 grand final win. In the 1984 season, Southport didn't make the grand final, but Taylor had played in two grand finals in 1978, after getting a permit to appear for Windsor-Zillmere in the QAFL premiership decider. A grand final every year from 1985 to 1990, of which Southport lost twice, meant that he averaged a grand final a year during that period.

It is endemic to New Zealand. This species is distributed throughout the country. Taxonomy This species was described in 1901 by Edward Meyrick. George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species both in his 1928 publication The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand, and in his 1950 book Fragments of New Zealand entomology. John S. Dugdale criticised the quality of Hudson's illustrations arguing that the images were not as brown as specimens of the moth. The lectotype was collected by Meyrick at Mount Arthur below Flora Saddle in the Nelson district. This specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. Description Meyrick described the species as follows: Alfred Philpott described the proboscis of the adult of this species as being long and well developed. The female of the species is lighter in appearance than the male. The colour and markings of this species shows considerable variation. Sooty beech scale Distribution This species is endemic to New Zealand. Specimens have been collected from Kaeo in the North Island to Invercargill in the South Island and it is regarded as being generally distributed throughout the country. This species has also been recorded at Pitt Island in the Chatham Islands. Biology and behaviour Adults are on the wing from October to February. They are nocturnal and are occasionally attracted to light. The larvae form a cocoon in their feeding place and pupate there. Habitat and host species This moth prefers native forest habitat, especially beech forest and manuka scrubland. It is also known to inhabit kanuka forest. The larvae of this species is associated with sooty mould and sooty beech scale. It has been hypothesised that B. agaura larvae feed on sooty beech scale. However they may also feed on the sooty mold itself. If B. agaura are found to consume scale insects this species will be one of the few that have larvae that are predatory.

Various allegations of bias, against conservatives have arisen throughout NPR's history. The Pew survey found that the NPR audience tends Democratic (17% Republican, 37% independent, 43% Democratic) and centrist (21% conservative, 39% moderate, 36% liberal). Allegations of ideological bias =Allegations of bias for and against Israel= NPR has been criticized for perceived bias in its coverage of Israel and the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), a pro-Israel American media monitoring organization based in Boston, has been particularly critical of NPR. CAMERA director Andrea Levin has stated, \\"We consider NPR to be the most seriously biased mainstream media outlet,\\" a statement that The Boston Globe describes as having \\"clearly gotten under her target's skin.\\" NPR's then-Ombudsman, Jeffrey Dvorkin, said in a 2002 interview that CAMERA used selective citations and subjective definitions of what it considers pro-Palestinian bias in formulating its findings, and that he felt CAMERA's campaign was \\"a kind of McCarthyism, frankly, that bashes us and causes people to question our commitment to doing this story fairly. And it exacerbates the legitimate anxieties of many in the Jewish community about the survival of Israel.\\"Camille T. Taiara.

Dvorkin, \\"NPR's Middle East 'Problem,'\\", NPR: Archive of Ombudsman Columns February 22, 2002, accessed July 21, 2006. [In June 2006 Dvorkin left the position of NPR Ombudsman to become the executive director of the Committee of Concerned Journalists (CCJ), an organization founded by Bill Kovach as part of the Project for Excellence in Journalism (CEJ), effective July 1, 2006; see Dvorkin's last column as NPR Ombudsman, \\"Dear Listeners: Thanks and Farewell,\\" and CEJ/CCJ press release, June 19, 2006. CAMERA organized a boycott in 2001-2002 which cost member station WBUR-FM between $1 and $2 million. The CAMERA boycott also extended to the New York Times and Washington Post. The Jewish Anti-Defamation League and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee have both criticized specific NPR reports as unbalanced, but neither accused the news organization of a consistent underlying bias. Other observers have also accused NPR of pro-Israel bias, including Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting. NPR hired a group to do outreach with both Jewish and Arab communities. An outside expert was appointed to perform quarterly self-reviews of its Israel-Palestine coverage from 2003 to 2013, finding \\"lack of completeness but strong factual accuracy and no systematic bias\\" and citing reasons why Palestinians were heard on-air less than Israelis, but overall voices from Arab countries were heard more. The 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict brought a fresh round of complaints to the ombudsman from both sides that NPR was not assigning blame to the other side, or that a particular story focused on an event or guest favorable to one side (to which the ombudsman responded that complainants ignored other balancing stories that featured the other side). =Allegations of elitism and the status quo= A 2004 FAIR study concluded that \\"NPR‚Äôs guestlist shows the radio service relies on the same elite and influential sources that dominate mainstream commercial news, and falls short of reflecting the diversity of the American public.\\"Steve Rendall & Daniel Butterworth, Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting, June 2004. Retrieved November 11, 2007. Further studies published in 2015 by FAIR demonstrate a lack of diversity in NPR's board members. The study found those occupying board seats of NPR and its member stations disproportionately have corporate affiliations such as investment funds, banking, consulting firms and corporate law firms with 75 percent of board members falling into such categories, with other non-corporate affiliations being current or former government officials, academia and the like. 72 percent of individuals are non-Latino white males. According to NPR, it receives 35% of its funding from local member station dues and fees, 33% from corporate sponsorships, and 13% from grants from non- profits. For many member stations, funds for NPR programming dues and fees are raised from listener contributions and grants. In 2014, NPR acknowledged a lack of cultural and ethnic diversity among guests, viewpoints and topics covered as well as the composition of their newsroom and board members. Noam Chomsky has criticized NPR as being biased toward ideological power and the status quo. He alleges that the parameters of debate on a given topic are very consciously curtailed. He says that since the network maintains studios in ideological centers of opinion such as Washington, the network feels the necessity to carefully consider what kinds of dissenting opinion are acceptable. Thus, political pragmatism, perhaps induced by fear of offending public officials who control some of NPR's funding (via CPB), often determines what views are suitable for broadcast, meaning that opinions critical of the structures of national-interest-based foreign policy, capitalism, and government bureaucracies (entailed by so-called \\"radical\\" or \\"activist\\" politics) usually do not make it to air. =Study results= Consumers of information from NPR contend that NPR does its job well. A study conducted in 2003 by the polling firm Knowledge Networks and the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes (University of Maryland at College Park) showed that those who get their news and information from public broadcasting (NPR and PBS - Public Broadcasting Service) are better informed than those whose information comes from other media outlets. In one study, NPR and PBS audiences had a more accurate understanding of the events in Iraq versus all audiences for cable and broadcast TV networks and the print media. Controversies =Mumia Abu-Jamal commentaries= In 1994, NPR arranged to air commentaries by Mumia Abu-Jamal on All Things Considered, but canceled them after the Fraternal Order of Police and members of the United States Congress objected to the airing. =Andrei Codrescu comment= On the December 19, 1995, broadcast of All Things Considered, NPR commentator Andrei Codrescu reported that some Christians believe in a \\"rapture\\" and 4 million believers will ascend to Heaven immediately. He continued, \\"The evaporation of 4 million who believe this crap would leave the world an instantly better place.\\" NPR subsequently apologized for Codrescu's comment, saying, \\"Those remarks offended listeners and crossed a line of taste and tolerance that we should have defended with greater vigilance.\\" Executive Producer Ellen Weiss said the incident would not sever NPR's relationship with Codrescu. =Juan Williams termination= On October 20, 2010, NPR terminated Senior News Analyst Juan Williams's independent contract after comments about Muslims which were referred to as \\"inconsistent with our editorial standards and practices, and undermined his credibility as a news analyst with NPR\\". Williams' remarks were made on the Fox News Channel's The O'Reilly Factor where he concurred with statements suggesting that the United States was facing a \\"Muslim dilemma\\". He also said, \\"I mean, look, Bill, I'm not a bigot. You know the kind of books I've written about the civil rights movement in this country. But when I get on the plane, I got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb and I think, you know, they are identifying themselves first and foremost as Muslims, I get worried. I get nervous.\\" Furthermore, referring to comments made by a Pakistani immigrant who pleaded guilty to trying to plant a car bomb in Times Square, Williams said \\"He said the war with Muslims, America's war is just beginning, first drop of blood. I don't think there's any way to get away from these facts.\\" NPR CEO Vivian Schiller defended NPR's decision by asserting that Williams has a history of making controversial comments in violation of NPR's ethics policy, with commentary expressed on Fox News and in newspaper opinion pieces. He was previously admonished for comments he made about US First-Lady Michelle Obama, \\"she's got this Stokely Carmichael in a designer dress thing going. If she starts talking ... her instinct is to start with this blame America, you know, I'm the victim. If that stuff starts to coming out, people will go bananas and she'll go from being the new Jackie O. to being something of an albatross.\\" This was far from an isolated incident, and Williams‚Äô appearances on Fox News had caused repeated problems for NPR over the last few years. Williams had also \\"been warned several times that [Bill] O‚ÄôReilly is a professional provocateur and to be careful.\\" Williams and others have said that in firing him, NPR exhibited a double standard by not firing other NPR people like Andrei Codrescu for his comment about Christians who believe in a rapture and Nina Totenberg for her 1995 comments about Senator Jesse Helms and AIDS. After NPR announced his ouster, Alicia Shepard, NPR's ombudsman, said that the firing could have been handled better. She opined that Williams could have been given a chance to explain himself to NPR's management or been suspended pending review of his case. However, she agreed with NPR's decision, saying \\"the fact remains that NPR must uphold its journalistic standards, which, after all, provide the basis that earned public radio's reputation for quality.\\" \\"Probably the better thing for NPR to have done is to have said 'Juan the situation is not working,'\\" Shepard said, noting that Williams could have been given a choice: \\"If he wanted to stay at NPR, he would have to stop doing commentary on Fox News Channel. Or, if he preferred to continue with Fox, he and NPR could part ways.\\" Schiller told an audience at the Atlanta Press Club that Williams should have kept his feelings about Muslims between himself and \\"his psychiatrist or his publicist\\". Later, Schiller placed a post on the NPR website \\"I spoke hastily and I apologize to Juan and others for my thoughtless remark‚Äù. Although a number of prominent conservatives, including Jim DeMint, Sarah Palin, and Newt Gingrich have renewed long-standing calls that NPR lose federal funding that it currently receives, donations from NPR listener-members during NPR's October fundraising drive remained unaffected in the first 3 days. FOX News granted Williams a new $2 million, three-year contract with an expanded role at their network. FOX has been heavily promoting the incident \\"with hourly reports about the controversy on both its news and opinion programs.\\" Bill O'Reilly has accused NPR of bias in firing Williams. It was determined after an external review by legal counsel that Williams was properly terminated according to the terms of his contract, which gave both parties the right to terminate on 30 days' notice for any reason, and the termination was not the result of special- interest group or donor pressure. The board of directors also adopted recommendations and remedial measures designed to address issues that surfaced with the review, including new internal procedures concerning personnel and on-air talent decisions, and disciplinary action with respect to certain management employees involved in the termination. These measures included Ellen Weiss, the Senior Vice President who fired Juan Williams, stepping down on January 6, 2011, under what is believed to be substantial pressure from more senior management, and CEO Vivian Schiller not being awarded her 2010 bonus.NPR Executive Who Fired Juan Williams Steps Down; The Hollywood Reporter; January 6, 2011 =Ronald Schiller= In March 2011 conservative political provocateur James O'Keefe sent partners Simon Templar (a nom de plume not to be confused with the fictional character) and Shaughn Adeleye to secretly record their discussion with Ronald Schiller, NPR's then-senior vice president for fundraising, and his associate, the senior director of institutional giving at NPR, Betsy Liley. The NPR executives were misled that they would be meeting with representatives of a self-described Muslim group, Muslim Education Action Center (MEAC), that wished to donate money to NPR, \\"partly out of concern for the defunding process the Republicans are trying to engage in.\\" On the recording, Schiller indicates that he is sharing his personal point of view, not NPR‚Äôs, saying he'll \\"talk personally, as opposed to wearing my NPR hat\\"; then he contrasted the fiscally conservative Republican party of old that didn't get involved in people's personal and family lives with \\"the current Republican Party, particularly the Tea Party, that is fanatically involved in people's personal lives and very fundamental Christian‚ÄîI wouldn't even call it Christian. It's this weird evangelical kind of move.\\" Schiller said some highly placed Republicans believed the Republican Party had been hijacked by this radical group, and characterized them as \\"Islamophobic\\" and \\"seriously racist, racist people\\". Later in the recording, Schiller said he believes NPR \\"would be better off in the long run without federal funding, and the challenge right now is that we'd have a lot of stations go dark\\", explaining that removal of federal funding would allow NPR more independence, and remove the widely held misconception that NPR is significantly funded by the public. Subsequent analysis of the raw videos showed that the clips were heavily edited to present only one point of view, and that much of the context of the conversation was changed.Does Raw Video of NPR Expose Reveal Questionable Editing Tactics?; The Blaze; March 10, 2011 According to NPR, Schiller's comments are in direct conflict with NPR's official position and they called his comments appalling. They also stated that, \\"The fraudulent organization represented in this video repeatedly pressed us to accept a $5 million check with no strings attached, which we repeatedly refused to accept.\\" A second recording released a couple of days later by O'Keefe showed that after phone and e-mail communications, Betsy Liley checked with senior management and said that although MEAC had been cleared to legally make donations anonymously, additional background information was required before a donation could be accepted, including an IRS Form 990. Schiller had submitted his resignation on January 24, before the recorded meeting, and announced a week before the video was released that he was leaving NPR for a position at the Aspen Institute, but he was immediately put on \\"administrative leave\\" by NPR.Video of Ronald Schiller Veritas Project; March 8, 2011 The next day NPR's CEO Vivian Schiller (who is not related) announced she was resigning her position, effective immediately. Ronald Schiller made his resignation from NPR effective immediately on the evening of the video's release and the next day decided also to cede his new position at the Aspen Institute. =Vivian Schiller= NPR announced that CEO Vivian Schiller has resigned after controversial comments made by NPR's former top fundraising executive, Ron Schiller (no relation to Vivian), came to light in a secret video. A statement released in March 2011 by NPR's board of directors said the resignation by Vivian Schiller, who also faced criticism last fall for the dismissal of commentator Juan Williams, was accepted. But NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik tells Morning Edition host Renee Montagne that his sources were telling him that the CEO was forced out. Dave Edwards, chairman of NPR's board, said directors came to the conclusion that the controversies under Schiller's watch had become such a distraction that she could no longer effectively lead the organization. She had told the directors that they should take the action they felt was appropriate, and Edwards said the board decided it would be best for her to depart.Vivian Schiller, CEO Of NPR, Steps Down> According to a CEO succession plan adopted by the board in 2009, Joyce Slocum, SVP of legal affairs and general counsel, has been appointed to the position of interim CEO. The board will immediately establish an executive transition committee that will develop a time frame and process for the recruitment and selection of new leadership. =Michael Oreskes sexual harassment allegations= In October 2017, two journalists accused Michael Oreskes of sexual harassment while working as the Washington, DC bureau chief for The New York Times during the 1990s. Oreskes became NPR's senior vice president of news and editorial director in 2015. After a report on the accusations was published in The Washington Post, NPR put Oreskes on administrative leave. Rebecca Hersher, an NPR journalist, went on the record about attending a career counseling session in October 2015 in which she says Oreskes discussed having sex with his girlfriend. At the time, Hersher filed a complaint against Oreskes, and NPR reprimanded him for his behavior. His resignation was requested by NPR's chief executive Jarl Mohn and Oreskes left NPR on November 1, 2017. Oreskes issued a statement saying he was \\"deeply sorry to the people I hurt. My behavior was wrong and inexcusable, and I accept full responsibility.\\" He reimbursed NPR $1,800 in improper expense account charges. The Washington Post later reported that multiple sexual abuse allegations against Oreskes were ignored by NPR management during his two years there, and that NPR's handling of Oreskes had prompted a \\"virtual rebellion\\" among staffers. Staffers told CNN's Brian Stelter that Oreskes created an oppressive atmosphere by abusing his position to meet young women. A law firm was retained to probe NPR's handling of Oreskes, and Mohn conceded he did not act fast enough, The law firm's report, issued in February 2018, found that questions were raised about Oreskes' treatment of women even before he was hired, and that reports of misconduct were relayed to management right up to his firing. It found that repeated warnings to top management about his behavior toward women and expense account, which he used to pay for meetings with women, were ineffective, and that there was a high level of mistrust toward management. =Anti-Hindu statement from producer= In 2019, an NPR producer based in Delhi was forced to resign from her job following a backlash over a tweet in which she called Hindus as \\"piss drinking and dung worshipping\\" and that they should \\"give up Hinduism\\". =Mike Pompeo and Mary Louise Kelly= During the middle of the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, on January 24, 2020, Mary Louise Kelly an NPR reporter (All Things Considered) interviewed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. After asking several questions about Iran‚ÄìUnited States relations, Kelly asked why Pompeo had not supported Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch during the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal. Pompeo replied that he has always supported every State Department employee, although he was unable or unwilling to cite a single example of support for Yovanovitch. Kelly says that Pompeo ended the interview and took her to a private room where he yelled at her, using several expletives. He asked her if she could find Ukraine on a map; she says she pointed to Ukraine, while he claims she pointed to Bangladesh. In a move the State Department Correspondents' Association described as \\"retaliation,\\" the State Department then denied NPR correspondent Michele Kelemen a seat on Pompeo's flight to Europe and Central Asia. President Donald Trump praised Pompeo for the interview, while suggesting he would cut funding for NPR.

Summary of main works With the advent of Existential-Integrative Psychotherapy,Schneider, K.J. (2008). Existential-integrative psychotherapy: Guideposts to the core of practice. New York: Routledge. Schneider expanded the traditional focus of existential therapy on depth exploration to include other, more mainstream treatment modalities. By the same token, he broadened mainstream treatment modalities with the ever-present availability of depth exploration.Hoffman, L., Yang, M., & Kaklauskas, F.J. (2009). \\"Existential psychology east-west.\\" Colorado Springs: University of the Rockies Press. Existential-Integrative therapy is a \\"deeply relational approach which uses a range of therapeutic concepts and strategies to help clients engage more fully with their experiencing\\".Cooper, M. (2009). Person-Centered and Experiential Psychotherapies, Vol. 8, p. 165. Schneider discussed freedom at the level of psychosexuality and how it entails the integration of one's sexual-aggressive past. According to Schneider, liberation at this level strengthens one's ego. Another form of freedom he discussed is that at the level of interpersonal relations and how it acknowledges and transcends freedom at the level of psychosexual relations. He says that at the interpersonal level, freedom balances individual striving and uniqueness with interpersonal dependence and connectedness. He coined the term 'experiential freedom' saying that it \\"embraces not only physiology, environmental conditioning, cognition, psychosexuality, and interpersonal relations, but also cosmic or intersituational relations\\". Schneider begins by defining and describing ‚Äúawe,‚Äù a most important attitude and state of being, which has become much less central to our lives in these times. Awe is a fluid attitude, which incorporates wonder, dread, mystery, veneration, and the embracing of paradox. Cultivating awe as central in our consciousness requires that we move away from many of the values with which we are continually confronted: consumerism, conventionality, competitiveness, and mindless entertainment. An awe inspired life also counters all sorts of dogmatic beliefs and convictions, be they fundamentally religious or rigidly atheistic.John L. Levy The Humanistic Psychologist (April 2007), 35 (2), pg. 219-222 With Rediscovery of AweSchneider, K.J. (2004). Rediscovery of awe: Splendor, mystery, and the fluid center of life. St. Paul, MN: Paragon House. and Awakening to Awe,Schneider, K.J. (2009). Awakening to Awe: Personal stories of profound transformation. Lanham, MD: Jason Aronson. Schneider drew upon the rich heritage of existential-spiritual philosophy as elaborated by such thinkers as Paul Tillich, Martin Buber, Abraham Heschel, S√∏ren Kierkegaard, and William James as well as his own clinical and personal observations to cultivate an \\"awe-based\\" approach to psychology and life. By \\"awe-based,\\" Schneider means the sense of humility and wonder or adventure one experiences simply by living. While the sense of awe may be inherent to living it also must be cultivated periodically, lest it be crushed by our \\"quick fix,\\" efficiency oriented culture; or by political or religious dogma. In Rediscovery of Awe, Schneider set forth the principles of an awe-based psychology as well as applications of those principles to concrete spheres of life, such as the educational setting, the work setting, and the ethical-spiritual setting. In \\"Awakening to Awe,\\" Schneider focused specifically on how the sense of awe radically transformed seven lives. Among the people he investigated were a former gang member who became a gang mediator, an ex drug addict who became a case worker and Yoga instructor, and a survivor of stage-three cancer. Finally, in Existential-Integrative Psychotherapy, Schneider showed how the humility and wonder cultivated in good therapy can inspire the humility and wonder, or, in short awe, that can be nurtured outside of good therapy. In his most recent book, \\"The polarized mind: Why it's killing us and what we can do about it,\\" (2013), Schneider shows how the sense of awe and encounter with life's mystery can be an antidote to destructive and totalitarian cultures as well as individuals. In his works he took the approach of humanistic psychologists. In this field of psychology, Schneider credits Abe Maslow for being an influential figure in his early years in the field of psychology. He acknowledges that his humanistic perceptions were awakened by Maslow's works. He believed that Maslow implied that our healing comes from our \\"restoration of awe, the attunement to a larger picture of life\\". He was a proponent for spiritual healing and trying to attain fulfillment. He uses the theory of awe as a therapeutic method in enlivening lives.  Publications  =Books= *Schneider, K.J.

Two reactors located at the Koeberg nuclear power station accounts for around 5% of South Africa's electricity production. Spent fuel is disposed of at Vaalputs Radioactive Waste Disposal Facility in the Northern Cape. The SAFARI-1 tank in pool research reactor is located at the Pelindaba nuclear research centre in Gauteng. New build The 2010 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) envisages building 9,600 MWe of new nuclear power capacity by building between six and eight new nuclear reactors by 2030, which would cost about R1 trillion. Five countries, South Korea, France, Russia, US, and China have bid to supply the reactors. As of 2015, Russia's Rosatom and Chinese companies are the front runners to supply new nuclear plants due to their commitments to finance the builds. In 2008 Max Lee, CEO of Eskom, announced Eskom plans to build 20 GW of nuclear power by 2025, the first station of which could be completed by 2017. However, the investment decision to go ahead with this was not made. Until 2010, South Africa had an expansion policy based upon the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) but government financing was withdrawn because of missed deadlines and lack of customers. Several groups, including Earthlife Africa and Koeberg Alert, had opposed these plans. In 2016, an updated draft IRP was published which set a much lower and slower nuclear target, due to lower demand projections and increased capital cost. This updated IRP envisaged that the first new nuclear power plant would only need to be online by 2041. Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson said that nuclear is non-negotiable for SA because the country lacks adequate water to support coal-fired power generation. However, some energy experts believe that South Africa does not need the extra energy that a new nuclear power plant would generate but can and should make use of on renewables such as solar and wind, of which South Africa is well positioned to take advantage. In January 2018 Eskom's acting Chief Financial Officer stated that the company cannot afford a new build, following a 34% drop in interim profits due to declining sales and increasing financing costs. The government stated it will proceed with the plan but more slowly. The draft 2018 IRP does not call for new nuclear power, partly due to declining electricity demand, forecast 30% lower than in the previous IRP. = Criticism = There has been much concern about the cost of the endeavour, as well as the possibility for corruption, due to the lack of transparency in the procurement processes and the disregard of civic society. President Jacob Zuma nevertheless pushed ahead with plans to secure nuclear power.  Legality  Following the Public Protector's \\"State of Capture\\" report, which implicated him and Jacob Zuma in the peddling of state patronage, Brian Molefe resigned from his position as executive chief of Eskom on 1 January 2017. However, analysts noted that corruption at Eskom was deep-rooted and that Molefe's resignation would not resolve the nuclear question. In April, 2017, Eskom requested that the Treasury department waive procurement regulations for the new nuclear plants, claiming that Eskom \\"had done a lot of the work prior\\" and that these efforts were adequate. The Democratic Alliance objected on the grounds that this would embark the state on its \\"single biggest public procurement without fully assessing associated risks and consequences for SA‚Äôs economy\\". On 26 April 2017, following a legal application by Earthlife Africa and the Southern African Faith Communities Environment Institute, the Western Cape High Court declared that the South African government's new nuclear procurement processes had been unlawful because they had not followed due processes. The court noted that the National Energy Regulator, Parliament, and the Energy Minister must all be involved in the process. All of the subsequent existing contracts with Russia, the US, and South Korea were therefore found to be void.  Costs  The R1 trillion cost of the new nuclear project has played a part in ratings downgrades by international credit ratings agencies. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, who opposed new nuclear installations on the grounds of its steep cost, was replaced by Malusi Gigaba in March, 2017. Gigaba is responsible for filling the vacancy of chief procurement officer at Treasury, which would make decisions about procurement processes regarding the new nuclear project.  Life Extension of Koeberg  South Africa's 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP )plans a 20 year life- extension for Koeberg to 2044, and a delayed nuclear new build programme due to the \\"marginal cost of [nuclear] generation, in comparison to other options\\" with a scenario that may build new capacity after 2030. Small modular reactors may become an attractive option, dependent on earlier demonstration elsewhere in the world.. = Nuclear expertise in South Africa = AREVA built the twin units of the Koeberg nuclear power plant. In 2001, AREVA NP ( renamed Framatome in 2018 ) bought a 45% stake in LESEDI Nuclear Services, followed by a further 6% stake in 2006. Today Framatome is a majority shareholder in Lesedi Nuclear Services. In 2016, the IAEA Concluded a Long Term Operational Safety Review at South Africa‚Äôs Koeberg Nuclear Power Plant. The Pre-SALTO (Safety Aspects of Long Term Operation) review mission was requested by the Government of South Africa‚Äôs Department of Energy. \\"A SALTO peer review is a comprehensive safety review addressing strategy and key elements for the safe Long Term Operation of nuclear power plants\\".

Its antennulae resemble anomalocaridid great appendages.  Morphology  The body of K. soperi consisted of a simple head shield, 16 trunk segments (tergites) and a tail plate. The species reached a length of and was in outward appearance almost elliptical, about twice as long as wide, with the widest point in the front third of the body at the 3rd to 5th tergite. The head plate was simple, convex in shape, wider than long, and represented about 20% of the total body length. The tergites were short, about five times as wide as long, and the rear edge of each tergite to overshadow the following by about a fifth of its length. The tergites 1‚Äì5 all had about the same width, the following tergites have been coming back ever narrower. In the middle of an axis was clearly seen, which constituted about half the width of a tergite and gave him a three-lobed shape. At the lateral ends of each tergite existed rearwardly longer and longer spines. The tiny tail was semi- circular, about half as long as wide; and the front half had to two-thirds of the tail shield also has a three-lobed shape. The first segment bore a ventral pair of large limbs, known as the antennule, which are about half to two- thirds as long as the body. They consisted of a cylindrical stem and about 15 segments. The segments had a flat outer side and two widely spaced spines. The other limbs ‚Äì three pairs in the head region shield and 16 on the body segments ‚Äì composed of two branches. The basipod was long, trapezoid-shaped and had two rows with different numbers of spines. The exopods were paddle- like lobes, which were fringed with bristles. The length was little more than two thirds of the length of the endopodite. Its gut is occasionally preserved in three dimensions, perhaps in phosophate. Ecology It is believed that Kiisortoqia was a predatory swimmer. The large paddle-like exopods were probably suitable for swimming. With its robust antennule, K. soperi could capture prey, probably using its prickly basipods to bring them to its mouth.  Etymology  The name of the genus is derived from the Greenlandic word ', meaning \\"predator\\" or \\"hunter\\". The specific epithet is in honor of Norman John (Jack) Soper who, together with A. K. Higgins, discovered the Sirius Passet fauna and collected the first fossils from the locality.  Distribution  More than 170 specimens of the species were recovered in the course of several expeditions between 1985 and 2006 from the Lower Cambrian Sirius Passet Konservat-Lagerst√§tte, in Peary Land, northern Greenland. The specimens are usually more or less completely preserved: disarticulated fossils were not discovered. Systematic position Kiisortoqia soperi possesses three crown-arthropod homologies: a head shield with three pairs of limbs, plus the antennula; postantennular biramous limbs; and flap-like exopods fringed with setae. An exact position within the arthropods, however, cannot be determined, due to the possible lack of eyes and the ambiguous shape of the tail plate. A possible synapomorphy of the antennules with the chelicerates is purely speculative. A later cladistic analysis resolved Kiisortoqia as sister to the rest of crown-group arthropods studied.

From the first expansion beyond Germany in 1966 through its entry into the U.S. market in the early 1970s and accelerated growth worldwide throughout the past two decades, much of the growth of Brenntag has been enabled by selective acquisitions in key growth areas around the world. Brenntag Headquarter \\"House of Elements\\" in Essen. In the 1980s, the company continued to expand in the USA through acquisitions of several distribution companies. In the following decade Brenntag expanded within Europe through acquisitions and joint ventures. By acquiring Holland Chemical International, then the fifth largest chemical distributor worldwide, in 2000 Brenntag gained market shares in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and the USA and became a market leader in Latin America. In the following ten years the company acquired companies worldwide and therewith expanded its network and market shares. At the same time new chemical distribution centers were built at strategic locations. The most recent milestone acquisition was the purchase in late 2008 of the distribution business of Rhodia, giving Brenntag the first distribution presence in the Asia Pacific region. In 2010 and 2011 Brenntag further expanded its market presence in the region significantly by acquiring EAC Industrial Ingredients Ltd. A/S and Zhong Yung (International) Chemical Ltd. Since 29 March 2010, Brenntag AG (WKN A1DAHH) is listed at the German Stock Exchange in the Prime Standard Segment, since 21 June 2010 as a member of the MDAX index.

The improvisational freedom of this music is reflected in his works.  The chemigram  In 1952 he made an important acquaintance: Georges Brassens, the poet and singer, who was unknown at the time. He recorded and photographed him. Brassens left a deep influence on Cordier and encouraged him to continue exploring the \\"unfrequented steep road\\"Brassens (Georges), January 1979, \\"Pr√©face √† l‚Äôoccasion de l‚Äôexposition Pierre Cordier √† la Biblioth√®que Nationale\\", in: Pierre Cordier, Paris, Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, 5. that he had chosen. After studying political science at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, Cordier completed his military service in Germany in 1956. It was there that a new pathway opened up for him: the chemigram. On November 10, 1956, writing a dedication with nail polish on photographic paper to a young German woman named Erika, Pierre Cordier discovered what he later called the chemigram. This technique, which \\"combines the physics of painting (varnish, oil, wax) and the chemistry of photography (photosensitive emulsion, developer, and fixer), without the use of a camera or enlarger, and in full light\\",Cordier (Pierre), 2007. le chimigramme ‚Äì the chemigram, Brussels, Editions Racine, 237. became for him a source of experiments and a plastic language. It opened up a new visual space at the boundaries of painting, photography, and writing, allowing him \\"to create entrancing images impossible to realize by any other means. Working like a painter, he replaces the canvas with photographic paper.\\"Barnes (Martin), 2010. Introduction to the exhibition \\"Shadow Catchers\\", 2010, 10‚Äì11. Martin Barnes is one of the curators of the Victoria & Albert Museum, London. Alongside his visual research, he continued in his career as a professional photographer, finally abandoning it in 1967. Several important figures in the arts became interested in these new visual possibilities, among them Otto Steinert (1915‚Äì1978), professor and founder of the Subjektive Fotografie movement. Thanks to his encouragement, Cordier produced many chemigrams as well as photographic self-portraits. These works were exhibited in 1958 during the Subjektive Fotografie 3 exhibition in Cologne.  The years 1970, 1980 and 2000  From the 1960s until the mid-1970s Cordier continued his experiments: chromatic research (1961), the photo-chemigram (1963), and magical varnish (1972). He also produced some experimental films and became a lecturer at the √âcole nationale des arts visuels in Brussels from 1965 to 1998. At a time when artistic photography was not really accepted in Europe, the exhibition he had (with Denis Brihat and Jean-Pierre Sudre) at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1967 was a major event. The next year he was one of the founders, with Gottfried J√§ger, of the Generative Fotografie movement in Germany. His meeting with Aaron Siskind in 1977 was crucial: this great American photographer became his spiritual father and introduced him to many important figures in the New Bauhaus circle of Chicago. The end of the seventies was an especially fruitful period of exhibits and contacts, and also marked his technical mastery of the chemigram technique. The year 1988 was emblematic of this maturity, with a retrospective of the artist's work at the Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels, the creation of a monumental piece for the Brussels subway, and his induction into the Acad√©mie royale de Belgique. He resided in the south of France from 1992 to 2007, gathering material for the publication of a monograph which synthesizes fifty years of research. Since its publication in 2007, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Victoria & Albert Museum in London have each acquired five chemigrams for their collections. Those at the Victoria and Albert Museum were on view from October 2010 until February 2011. Arising from hybrid techniques, the work of Pierre Cordier has always been difficult to classify, and raises the question of affiliation from an art- historical point of view. Yet an authentic personal mythology emerges, whose indecipherable language would be key to providing the answer.

Included in the park are the highest summits (Aitxuri, 1,551 m) in the Cantabrian-Mediterranean watershed, which together form a massif that is a centre for Basque mountaineering. Declared a natural park in 2006, the area contains limestone ridge-and-valley and siliceous intrusion biomes.\\"Aizkorri- Aratz Natural Park\\", in the website of the Government of the Basque Autonomous Community. 76/2006 Decree of the Government of the Basque Autonomous Community, declaring Aizkorri-Aratz a Natural Park, 4 April 2006. A sheep barn in Aratz Location This natural park is situated in the Basque Country, Spain. It was declared a natural park in 2006. It is located in the provinces of Gipuzkoa (80 per cent) and Alava (20 per cent). Four towns in the province of Alava are within the park ‚Äì Asparrena, Zalduondo, San Mill√°n/Donemiliaga, and Barrundia ‚Äì and seven of Gipuzkoa: Leintz-Gatzaga, Eskoriatza, Aretxabaleta, O√±ati, Legazpi, Zerain, and Zegama. The park includes all the lands of the \\"Gipuzkoa eta Arabako Partzuergo Orokorra / Parzoner√≠a General de Gipuzkoa y √Ålava\\". Weather The park has a humid climate, with no drought in the summer, because of the altitude. The northern slope is wetter than the southern. The climate varies from area to area due to differences in the terrain. The temperature is mild, but the winters are cold. Landscape Although the mountains are the most noticeable characteristic of the park, the area has vegetation, fauna, and phenomena not present in other mountainous areas. Aizkorri-Aratz; view from Legunbe =Mountains= The park is in a mountain area near the Aralar Range, which is one of the corridors linking the Pyrenees to the Cantabrian Mountains. Highlights include the rock wall that extends between the mountains of Alo√±a and Aratz. The highest altitudes of the Basque Autonomous Community are the peaks of Aitxuri (1,551 metres) and Aizkorri (1,544 metres). =Substrates, vegetation and phenomena= The substrate of the area consists of urgonian limestone, which create karstic phenomena such as ridges, sinkholes, torques, and ravines. Notable formations include the basin of La Lece, the tunnel of San Adri√°n, Urbia's depression, and Arantzazu's ravine. In Elguea-Urkilla the substrate changes; sandstones and clays are present. In the natural park some magnificent large autochthonous forests are conserved, which contain beech and white oak (Quercus petraea). Rare vegetation is present at higher altitudes, such as mountain meadows and heather, and fruits, which are the food of the menhaden sheep. =Fauna= European Pine Marten Iberian Frog The fauna associated with the forest are the black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), eagles, owls, the vultures, and more than 20 species that are protected under European legislation. Amphibians present in the ponds include the triton and the Iberian Frog. Mammals include the bobcat and the marten. Pine marten This animal is a mustelid, and is native to Northern Europe. Its body is up to , and its bushy tail can be . Males are slightly larger than females; on average a marten weighs around . Their fur is usually light to dark brown and grows longer and silkier during the winter months. They have a cream to yellow coloured \\"bib\\" marking on their throats. Nocturnal and somewhat arboreal in habit, it eats small mammals, small birds, insects, and frogs. They also eat fruits and eggs of birds. Martens are occasional prey of eagles, owls, and foxes. In captivity they live up to 18 years, in the wild eight to ten years. They reach sexual maturity at two to three years. Their young, with a birth- weight of approximately 30 grams, are usually born in March or April after a seven-month-long gestation period, in litters of one to five. Iberian frog The Iberian frog or Rana Patilarga, Rana iberica, is a species of frog in the family Ranidae. It is native and limited to Portugal and Spain. Its natural habitats are rivers, intermittent rivers, and swamps. Archaeological traces Aizkorri's Roman road Because of the karstic properties of the rock, there are many caves in the park. Most of them, including Arrikrutz and Aizkirri, have prehistoric deposits, including the remains of lions and bears. The cave at Otzaurte links Alava and Gipuzkoa. A small furnace to smelt iron from the Bronze Age has been found in the area. In some parts of the park, it is still possible to view the Roman road to Vitoria-Gasteiz, and it is one of the trails of the Camino de Santiago. There are also roads extant from the Middle Ages, such as San Adrian's road. Amenities for tourists The nearest airport is Foronda (Vitoria Airport). The airport at Loiu, Vizcaya, is also nearby. The road to the park is clearly marked, and tourist accommodations are available. Restaurants and cafes are on site.

The siege failed and the army had to retreat, while the international community condemned the attacks. In 2001, the ICTY charged Jokiƒá, Pavle Strugar, Milan Zec and Vladimir Kovaƒçeviƒá on several counts.

History The first Belarusian film festival ‚ÄúListapad‚Äù began in 1994 at a time when Belarus had just gained independence and had fallen out of the world and post-soviet film industry. Serhey Artimovich,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2695357/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 the director of ‚ÄúTele-ARS‚Äù studio, came up with the idea for the festival. ‚ÄúListapad‚Äù was created in order to unite the best films of post-soviet states and bring them back on the screen in Minsk. The participating films had already passed through the more radical film festivals of ‚ÄúKinotavr‚Äù and ‚ÄúKinoshock‚Äù.http://www.kinoshock.ru/eng/main/ During the first year of existence, the festival was called ‚ÄúPost-soviet Film festival ‚ÄúListapad‚Äù. Russian directors made the majority of films, presented there. Later works of Ukrainian, Kazakh and Azerbaijani directors joined the program of the festival. Rating system was established since the first year. Viewers give their rate to the film in special forms, which are spread before the screening. The top prize of the Festival is called ‚ÄúGolden ‚ÄúListapad‚Äù. Other two are ‚ÄúSilver Listapad‚Äù and ‚ÄúListapad Bronze Audience Award‚Äù. International Jury and International Film Critics Jury award them to the competing works. Rostislav Yankovsky became the Chairman of the Festival in 1994 (currently holding a position of Honorary Chairman of the Festival). Between 1996 and 2008 Valentina Stepanova was directing the Festival. During this period, representatives of 45 countries have joined the Festival as directors, producers, jury and press. New nominations were introduced and special prizes from media and guilds were established as well as prizes for Best Actress and Best Actor. The Children and Youth Films Competition ‚ÄúListapadzik‚Äù became the main novelty of the festival in 2008. In 2003, the Festival was officially recognized as an International. Films from Poland, Russia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, USA, Iran, China and Japan were screened at the Festival during this year. 2007 was also special for the festival. Valentina Stepanova and film critic and editor Irina Demyanova have organized the first Documentary Films Competition. Since then Irina Demyanovahttp://www.listapad.com/en/komanda holds the position of Documentary Film program director of the Festival. In 2010, Anzhela Krashevskayahttp://www.listapad.com/en/komanda became the director of the Festival. Igor Sukmanovhttp://www.listapad.com/en/komanda has been Feature Film program director since this year. 2010 was also a year for renovation of the Festival.

This species is endemic to New Zealandwhere it is known from the southern part of the South Island. The female of the species is flightless and pale brown, grey or yellowish-brown in colour where as the male is brightly coloured and flies during the day. Taxonomy This species was first described by George Hudson in 1889 using specimens obtained from William Walter Smith and named Arctia strategica. Smith took the holotype specimen in February near the summit of the Richardson Range in South Canterbury by beating Carmichaelia australis. George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species in his 1898 publication New Zealand moths and butterflies (Macro-lepidoptera), and again in his 1928 book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. In both those publications he used the name Metacrias strategica, following the assignment of the species to that genus by Edward Meyrick in 1890. In 1914 Charles Rothschild proposed the subspecies Metacrias strategica hudsoni, however this was synonymised by John S. Dugdale in 1988. The holotype specimen is held at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Description Adults males are brightly coloured and diurnal, while females are pale brown, grey or yellowish-brown in colour. Metacrias strategica - life stages. A. Male. B. Larva C. Cocoon with pupa D. Female Hudson described the species as follows: Distribution M. strategica is endemic to New Zealand. It is known from the southern part of the South Island. It has been recorded in Otatara and at Waituna where it inhabits coastal silver tussock patches at the back of the shingle beach. Other sites in Southland include Brydone, Cannibal Bay, Waipapa Point and Sandy Point. Biology and behaviour Bulbinella hookeri - a host plant The larvae are polyphagous on grasses and herbs. They are hairy and are variable in colour, ranging from straw yellow to deep brown. The larvae appear to overwinter in the larval and pupal stages, the adults having only a very brief life span of approximately 21 days confined to the summer months. Early instars feed during warm periods. The last larval instar lives in the cold winter months of June to August and is inactive and overwinters until warmer spring weather occurs. Because of individual variations in the duration of the larval instars, pupae too may overwinter. Cocoons are attached to wood and will only rarely be under stones if there is no other ground cover. Although the females are flightless and tend to stay in their cocoon to bred and lay eggs, some females, after they pupate, have been show to leave and move a short distance from their nest. However main population disbursal is as a result of larvae movement. Habitat and host species This species is found in coastal and forest-edge sites up to the montane zone. The larvae have been observed feeding on European grasses, clover, species in the genera Acaena and Crepis, dandelion, plantain, and the endemic species Bulbinella hookeri. Other species consumed by the larvae include Gentiana bellidifolia, Senecio bellidioides, and Muehlenbeckia complexia.

It differs from the GNU C Library (glibc) in being designed for devices with less memory and processor power than a typical Linux system. It is also released under a BSD license, rather than the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) used for glibc. This difference was important in the early days of Android, when static linking was common, and is still helpful in introducing Android to software companies used to proprietary operating systems, who can be wary of the LGPL, and unclear about the differences between it and the full GNU General Public License (GPL). Bionic is a C library for use with the Linux kernel, and provides libc, libdl, libm, and libpthread. This differs from the BSD C libraries which require a BSD kernel.  Original goals  The original publicly stated goals for Bionic were the following: * BSD-licensed: Google wanted to isolate Android applications from the effect of copyleft licenses to create a proprietary user-space and application ecosystem, but:  Android is based on the Linux kernel, which is subject to the copyleft GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.  The most widespread standard C library for the Linux kernel is the GNU C Library (glibc), which is subject to the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), also a copyleft license. In contrast to the GPL, the LGPL explicitly allows for dynamic linking but it does not allow static linking of proprietary software without providing source code or linkable object files.  The permissive BSD license is a non-copyleft license that is compatible in both directions. A BSD-licensed glibc substitute could act as an isolation layer between the copyleft core (kernel) and the non-copyleft applications, and was therefore chosen by Google for its Bionic as a glibc substitute. * Small size: Bionic was much smaller than the GNU C Library; more importantly its memory requirements were (and remain) much lower. * Speed: Bionic was designed for CPUs at relatively low clock frequencies.  Supported architectures  Bionic only supports Linux kernels, but currently supports the arm, arm64, x86, and x86-64 architectures. The platform itself required armv7 with Neon since Marshmallow, though the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) continued to support armv5 (which it called armeabi) up until NDK r16. The NDK still supports armv7 both with and without Neon. Historically there was partial SH-4 support in the platform, but no devices ever shipped and support has since been removed. The NDK never supported SH-4, and MIPS and MIPS64 support were removed from the NDK in r17.  Components  Some parts of the libc source, such as stdio, are from the BSDs (mainly OpenBSD), whereas others, such as the pthread implementation, were written from scratch. The dynamic memory allocator implementation has changed over time. Before Lollipop there was a single native memory allocator, Doug Lea's dlmalloc. For Lollipop and Marshmallow there were two implementations: dlmalloc and jemalloc. jemalloc gives much higher performance than dlmalloc, but at the cost of extra memory required for bookkeeping. Most devices used jemalloc but low-memory devices still used dlmalloc. For Nougat and later releases, all devices uses jemalloc. Low-memory devices use a \\"svelte\\" configuration of jemalloc that disables the tcache to nearly match the lower memory overhead of dlmalloc while keeping most of the speed of jemalloc. Some 64-bit devices, like the Nexus 9, are effectively low-memory devices because of the extra space requirements of 64-bit pointers and hosting of two zygotes. (Zygote is an Android system service that is the parent of all Android application processes.) The libm source is largely FreeBSD's, but with optimized assembler contributed by the various SoC vendors. The dynamic linker (and libdl) were written from scratch. Bionic doesn't include libthread_db (used by gdbserver), but the NDK does. The Android platform includes a statically-linked gdbserver, so that developers can use the latest gdb even on old devices. There is no separate libpthread, libresolv, or librt on Android the functionality is all in libc. For libpthread, there's no attempt to optimize for the single- threaded case because apps are in a multi-threaded environment even before the first instruction of third-party code is ever run. The Android platform uses libc++ for the C++ standard library (releases up to and including Lollipop used stlport). The NDK historically offered stlport and GNU libstdc++, but those were removed as of NDK r18.https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/revision_history Note that if any native code in an Android app uses C++, all the C++ must use the same STL. The STL is not provided by the Android OS, and must be bundled with each app.  Differences from POSIX  Although Bionic aims to implement all of C11 and POSIX, there are still (as of Oreo) about 70 POSIX functions missing from libc. There are also POSIX functions such as the endpwent/getpwent/setpwent family that are inapplicable to Android because it lacks a passwd database. As of Oreo, libm is complete. Some functions deliberately do not conform to the POSIX or C standards for security reasons, such as printf which does not support the \`%n\` format string. Many of the most-used GNU extensions are implemented in Bionic, as are various BSD extensions.  Relationship to the NDK  Platform code uses Bionic directly, but third-party developers use the Android Native Development Kit (NDK). Many third-party developers still target older OS releases, which contributes to a widespread belief that bionic lacks many features. Gingerbread exported 803 functions from libc but Oreo exports 1278 (a 1.6x increase). Historically the NDK and the platform diverged, but NDK r11 and later have replaced NDK forks with their current platform equivalents. This work initially focused on the GCC and Clang compilers. Prior to NDK r14, when \\"unified\\" headers were first offered on an opt-in basis, the NDK had forked copies of the platform headers for different API levels. This meant that header-only fixes (fixes to constant or structure definitions, for example) weren't available to most NDK users because they'd be targeting an older API level, but platform fixes were only going in to the current platform headers. In the Oreo development period the platform headers were annotated with API level information so that the same set of headers can be used for all API levels, with only those functions available at the developer's targeted API level being visible. These are the so-called \\"unified\\" headers, and have been the default since NDK r15. Prior to NDK r16, the NDK linked a library called libandroid_support.a to code using libc++. This provided functions required by libc++ that weren't in old OS releases. This wasn't the same code used by the platform and introduced numerous bugs (such as breaking positional arguments to the printf family in any code that used libc++). In NDK r16 libandroid_support.a still exists, but is now built directly from platform source (current at the time the NDK is built).  Fortify source  As of Android Jelly Bean MR1 (4.2), Bionic supports similar functionality to glibc's \`_FORTIFY_SOURCE\`, which is a feature where unsafe string and memory functions (such as \`strcpy()\`, \`strcat()\`, and \`memcpy()\`) include checks for buffer overruns. These checks are performed at compile time if the buffer sizes can be determined at compile time, or run-time otherwise. Because fortify relies on runtime support from libc, its portability to older Android releases is limited. The platform itself is built with \`_FORTIFY_SOURCE\` enabled. Historically, one of the shortcomings of fortify has been that it's closely tied with GCC, which makes it very difficult to support well in other compilers, like Clang. This meant that when Android swapped to Clang as its default compiler, Bionic's fortify implementation became substantially less useful. In Android Oreo (8.0), Bionic's fortify was overhauled with Clang in mind, resulting in fortify on Clang providing an experience on par with fortify on GCC. Since this overhaul, some checks were added above and beyond glibc's to catch code that ‚Äî while not necessarily causing undefined behavior ‚Äî is obviously incorrect. Because this new implementation requires no more libc support than the prior one, the Clang-specific enhancements are available to applications targeting versions of Android before Oreo.  Controversies  For the creation of Bionic, Google used GPLv2-licensed Linux kernel header files. To get rid of the GPL, Google claimed that it cleaned the header files from any copyright-able work, reducing them to non-copyrightable \\"facts\\".Google android and the linux headers on theregister.com (2011)Android: Sued by Microsoft, not by Linux \\"Microsoft launches new Android suit, Linus Torvalds' take on Linux kernel headers and Android\\" on ITworld (March 21, 2011) Linux creator Linus Torvalds considered Google's behaviour to be acceptable, but Google's interpretation of the GPL has been challenged, for instance by Raymond Nimmer, a law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.Infringement and disclosure risk in development on copyleft platforms on ipinfoblog.com by Raymond Nimmer (2011)  See also  * Hybris (also known as libhybris) * musl * Toybox References External links Developer home page for Android * Android Native Development Kit (NDK) home page * Bionic sources (official repository) * Bionic notes on eLinux.org Android (operating system) C standard library Interfaces of the Linux kernel Software using the BSD license ","title":"Bionic (software)"},{"id":"31200946","text":"The cambroernids are an unranked clade of deuterosome animals. They include a number of early Paleozoic genera whose affinities with other animals, living or extinct, have been uncertain ('bizarre\\" or \\"orphan\\" taxa). This includes Herpetogaster (the type genus) and Phlogites, as well as the eldoniids (including the Cambrian Eldonia ludwigi from the Burgess Shale of Canada, Stellostomites eumorphus, Rotadiscus grandis, and Pararotadiscus guizhouensis from southwest China, and Seputus pomeroii from the Ordovician of Ireland). Cambroernids are defined by a set of common features including at least one pair of bifurcated or divided oral tentacles, and a large stomach and narrower intestine enclosed together in a coiled sac. The proposed evolutionary transformation is from more mobile forms living in the water column to less mobile forms living on the sea floor. Herpetogaster shows a clockwise-curved body attached to the substrate with a narrow mobile stolon, the caylx of Phlogites would be such a body fused into a complete circle, permanently attached to the substrate by a thick stalk, and eldoniids are a flattened form in which the stolon has been lost, resulting in a disc-shaped external form with a large curved stomach on one side. These translations of form are parallel to those seen in echinoderms (such as crinoids, sea urchins, sand dollars). Relationships to tentaculate lophotrochozoans are considered and rejected, with the balance of evidence currently supporting the clade as either stem echinoderms, stem hemichordates, or stem ambulacrarians (echinoderms+hemichordates).

It was designed by Giuseppe Sommaruga in the Liberty style and built between 1901 and 1903. The rusticated blocks of the basement imitate a natural rocky shape, while the rest of the decorations are inspired by 18th century stuccos. The building is now used as the seat of the Unione Commercianti di Milano (Traders' Union of Milan). History The palace was built for entrepreneur Ermengildo Castiglioni, who chose architect Giuseppe Sommaruga because of his anticonventional solutions. Castiglioni wanted the palace to reflect his wealth and grandeur; the choice of the Liberty style, a new and \\"trendy\\" style, for a building that would be located in the historic centre of Milan, was intended by Castiglioni and Sommaruga as a sort of challenge to the Milanese conservative √©lite. The most provocative element of the original design turned out to be a couple of nude female statues, by Ernesto Bazzaro, decorating the facade; these raised such turmoil that the local newspaper Guerin Meschino published a series of satyrical illustrations on them, and the Milanese population renamed the palace \\"C√† di ciapp\\" (in Milanese, \\"house of buttocks\\"). The statues, that were intended to represent \\"Peace\\" and \\"Industry\\", were eventually removed and are now used as decorations of another Milanese palace also by Sommaruga, Villa Faccanoni. The furniture was destroyed by the US army that occupied it in 1945-46 and used it as wood for heating. Only decorations, facades, iron work and lamps were saved. The building was put under the protection of the Beaux Arts on March 5, 1957. In 1967 the Castiglioni family sold the building to the Union of Commerce because of high costs of maintenance and a tax to finance the construction of the subway. Arch. Eugenio Gerli e Ing. Giorgio Keffer signed the project to transform it in an office building. They kept the entrance, the staircase, some large rooms on the first floor, the facades and the house on via Marina. The remaining part was emptied, an auditorium wss built under the garden, a new building was built next to the house on via Marina. The Art Nuoveau expert Rossana Bossaglia opposed the project and asked to use the building as Art Nouveau Museum. The superintendent approved the project because the Trader's Union of menaced to let the building deteriorate.The documentation is in the archive of Soprintendenza Belle Arti e Paesaggio di Milano DD/13358 - Corso Venezia 47 and in the book by F.

Motivations Like Freytag and Paul Heyse, Friedrich Spielhagen was chiefly concerned, in his novels, with defining the warring elements of German character and the opposing springs of German action in the period before and after the revolution of 1848. Like Freytag and Heyse, Spielhagen saw clearly the dangers that threatened the country, politically, religiously and morally from a reactionary aristocracy; like Heyse and unlike Freytag he saw the hope of the nation in the spread of an enlightened democracy rather than in a spiritual renaissance of the ruling classes. Description The hero of Problematische Naturen, Oswald Stein, is the mouthpiece for Spielhagen's revolutionary social theories. He is modeled after those characters of whom Goethe wrote ‚ÄúThere are problematical natures that do not fit into any situation and who remain always unsatisfied. For them there arises a terrible conflict that consumes life without enjoyment.‚Äù For Spielhagen, the conflict itself, even though it ends in defeat, is victory; the mere struggle against the domination of dead ideas is progress. For such a philosophy, there could be no better historical background than the Germany of 1848 and after, and Problematische Naturen with its sequel Durch Nacht zum Licht (1862), ‚Äî although it squanders material for half a dozen novels, idealizes Teutonic morbidity, and forsakes art for tendency, ‚Äî tells with remarkable vividness the story of the men and women who lived and thought and fought for freedom in Germany's day of hope.

It is considered the quintessential cabaret item number by Helen. The song was sung by Asha Bhosle and R.D. Burman. It was composed by R.D. Burman with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri. Music scholar Nilanjana Bhattacharjya identified \\"Piya Tu Ab To Aja\\" as one of the culturally important Hindi film songs. The song has also been called \\"the catalyst\\" that made \\"Asha [Bhosle] the queen of cabaret numbers\\". Music video The song was performed by Helen, who is known for doing item numbers in Bollywood films of the 1960s and 1970s. It is a highly suggestive song with Asha Bhosle breathing quickly at intervals, giving it an orgasmic sound. In the film, Helen performs the provocative dance in front of a large audience, including Sunita (played by actress Asha Parekh) who has just discovered that Monica (Helen) and her husband are having an affair. The picturisation is typical of the item numbers of the era portraying a \\"vamp\\" character who dances seductively for a nightclub audience. Remakes The song was later released as part of the video Raat Ki Rani (1987), a compilation of Helen's different cabaret numbers. Asha Bhosle recorded a new version in 2003 for the Kronos Quartet album You've Stolen My Heart: Songs from R.D. Burman's Bollywood. It also appears on the compilation album The Very Best of Asha Bhosle, The Queen of Bollywood. Composer Lesle Lewis released a remix of the song on his 2003 album Special Appointment Club Hits while R.P. Patnaik produced a Telugu version for the 2008 film Swagatam.

It is endemic to New Zealand. This species can be found in the lower half of the North Island and western alpine areas of the South Island. The female of the species is flightless and buff coloured whereas the male is brightly coloured and a rapid flier. Taxonomy Metacria erichrysa illustration by alt= M. erichrysa was originally described by Edward Meyrick in 1886 from specimens collected on Mount Arthur as well as from subsequently reared larvae. George Hudson discussed and illustrated the species in his 1898 publication New Zealand moths and butterflies (Macro-lepidoptera) as well as in his 1928 book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. Description Adults males are brightly coloured and diurnal, while females are buff coloured and extremely short- winged. Meyrick in his 1886 paper described the species as follows: Distribution This species is endemic to New Zealand, where it is known from the western alpine areas of the South Island and mountains of the lower half of the North Island. Biology and behaviour The females remain within their cocoon for mating and egg-laying. Once hatched the larvae first feed on her corpse. They then disperse widely. Larvae are present from mid summer until winter, when they commence larval diapause. The pupa is enclosed in a slight cocoon. Some larvae construct a 'nest' inside which they spin their cocoon. Cocoons are attached to any covering rock rather than to the ground or rocks below. It has been hypothesised that these behaviours are likely to protect the cocoon against melting snow. The male adults of this species are on the wing in mid November to early January. They fly rapidly and are difficult to catch. Males are attracted to females by pheromones. Males of this species can be attracted to the scent of females of different species within their genus. Researchers have used females as lures to take advantage of this behaviour to detect males in new localities. Habitat and host- plants Brachyglottis bellidioides The adult moths prefer open herb and tussock fields in mountainous terrain at altitudes of between 900 and 1200 m. The larvae feed on Brachyglottis bellidioides as well as other grasses and herbs. Endemic plants that M. erichrysa larvae feed on include Festuca novae-zealandiae and indigenous species from the genera Acaena, Muehlenbeckia, Wahlenbergia and Raoulia.

This species is endemic to New Zealand where it is known from the eastern areas of the South Island. The female of the species is flightless and buff coloured where as the male is brightly coloured and flies during the day. Taxonomy This species was described by Arthur Gardiner Butler in 1879 using two specimens collected in Queenstown by Frederick Hutton and named Phaos huttonii. In 1886 Edward Meyrick assigned this species to the genus Metacrias. George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species in his 1898 publication New Zealand moths and butterflies (Macro-lepidoptera), and again in his 1928 book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. In the latter publication Hudson used the name Metacrias huttoni to describe the species following George Hampson's use of that spelling in his Catalogue of Lepidoptera Phalaenae in the British Museum. This spelling has since been in common use as evidenced in the New Zealand Arthropod Collection as well as the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. Description The larvae of this species are approximately long, black and very hairy. The hairs on the terminal segments are the longest and the shortest hairs are reddish-ochreous-brown. There is are blue dots around each segment except the second. Adults males are brightly coloured and diurnal, while females are buff coloured and extremely short winged. Butler described the species as follows: Distribution This species is endemic to New Zealand. It is known from the eastern areas of the South Island. Biology and behaviour The female of the species is semiapterious and remains within her cocoon for mating and egg laying. As a result of this, the population disbursal of the species is limited to the wanderings of the larvae. The male of the species is diurnal and is on the wing from December to March. Males are attracted to females by pheromones. Males of this species can be attracted to the scent of females of different species within their genus. Researchers have used females as lures to take advantage of this behaviour to detect males in new localities. The larvae hibernates during winter. Pupae cocoons are normally found beneath stones. Habitat and host species Habitat of Metacrias huttoni on Coronet Peak This species prefers montane to low-alpine habitats. The larvae of M. huttoni feed on various mountain grasses. These include introduced species such as Trifolium repens, Arenaria serpyllifolia, Rumex acetosella, Cerastium fontanum and Taraxacum officinale as well as endemic species such as Festuca novae-zealandiae and indigenous species from the genera Acaena, Muehlenbeckia, Wahlenbergia and Raoulia. Threats It has been shown that sheep grazing within the habitat of this species is detrimental to its populations.

The church, consecrated in 1198, became world-famous both for its remarkable state of exterior preservation and for the best preserved set of pre-Mongol wall paintings in the Russian Empire. During the World War II it was selected as a target for artillery fire and was reduced to rubble. The post-war reconstruction of the Nereditsa Church is on the World Heritage list as a part of object 604 Historic Monuments of Novgorod and Surroundings. The building has been designated an architectural monument of federal significance (#5310113002). It is located in Novgorodsky District of Novgorod Oblast, Russia, south of Veliky Novgorod in the village of Spas-Nereditsy on the right bank of the Maly Volkhovets River on a small Nereditsa Hill next to the Rurik hillfort. History The church was built in 1198 by Prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich and painted with frescoes in 1199. The church was located outside the city of Novgorod but close to the residence of the prince. It was probably regarded by the prince as the place for his future tomb. In 1903-1904 it was measured and restored by Pyotr Pokryshkin. During World War II the church was located on the front line between 1941 and 1943 and was destroyed. It was subsequently restored, however, most of the frescoes could not be saved, and are currently known because the pre-war photos exist. Architecture The interior was frescoed in 1199 The small stone church is built as a cube and has one dome. It is based on four pillars and has three apses at the eastern side. The type of a small church was developed in Novgorod in the end of the 12th century, and there are several churches of this type, in Novgorod and in Staraya Ladoga. Frescoes The frescoes were created by eight to ten artists. They covered all the interior of the church, including the pillars, the walls, the ceiling, and the dome. There is no apparent system in creating the frescoes. It's possible that the painters did not know each other and had different styles. In particular, normally a fresco of Christ the Saviour should be painted in the dome. However, for the Saviour Church on Nereditsa, the dome was occupied by the Ascencion. Christ was painted in the dome in Byzantine Empire already in the 9th century, and painting other frescoes in the dome was at the time the sign that the church belongs to a highly peripheral region. The most impressive fresco in the church was considered to be the Last Judgment, painted over the whole western wall. Only fragments of this fresco survived. In 1246, a portrait of Prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich was added to the southern wall.

He was also chief justice of Jamaica for a time. Life He was the son of Theophilus Lynch Esq of Rixton Hall in Lancashire (born 1603), fourth son of William Lynch Esq of Cranbrook in Kent, and of his wife Judith, eldest daughter of Royal chaplain and Bishop of London John Aylmer. He served under Robert Venables in the army which went out to Jamaica in 1655. In January 1661, after a period back in England he was appointed provost-marshal of the island for life. In December 1662 Lynch was lieutenant- colonel of the 5th regiment of militia; in April 1663 was sworn in as a member of council, and in April 1664 elected president of the council in the absence of Sir Charles Lyttelton. In June 1664 Sir Thomas Modyford became governor, and Lynch was again sworn of the council. Shortly Modyford wrote to his brother, Sir James Modyford, then in England, asking him to get the Duke of Albemarle to appoint a sheriff, instead of a provost-marshal; but on 12 February 1665 Lynch wrote to Lord Arlington complaining that the governor had discharged him from the council and the office of chief justice without giving any public reason. Lynch was then obliged to return to England. At the end of 1670 he was ordered to go out again to Jamaica, as lieutenant-governor, with authority to command in the absence of Modyford. The commission was repeated in January 1671, when Modyford was recalled, and at the same time he received a commission from James, Duke of York to be commander-in-chief of his majesty's ships in and about Jamaica. He was knighted at Whitehall Palace on 3 December 1670. Lynch was criticized by his superiors in England for his conduct during the trial of pirate Peter Johnson; when the pirate was acquitted, Lynch ordered him re-tried and personally directed the trial, convicting and executing Johnson. Jamaica's buccaneers had been encouraged by Modyford. Under Lynch they acted under the governor's commission, including Henry Morgan; and the king claimed his share of the Spanish plunder. Diplomatic complaints from the Spanish government, however, compelled the English government to give way. Lynch was recalled, apparently in 1676, and Lord Vaughan was sent out with orders to suppress the pirates and put an end to piracy. In 1682 Lynch was again sent out to Jamaica as governor and captain-general, with similar instructions regarding piracy, and these he carried out severely. Among his targets was French pirate Jean Hamlin, who was repeatedly protected by St. Thomas' Governor Adolph Esmit. Under Lynch and Morgan, the colonial authorities tried in vain to defeat the Jamaican Maroons of Juan de Serras, but the Maroons just withdrew further into the Blue Mountains, out of the reach of the colonial militias.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 32-3. Lynch died, apparently in 1684, some time before the death of Charles II was known in the colony. Already ill, Lunch was incensed at captured pirate Joseph Bannister having evaded conviction on legal technicalities and passed away immediately after the infuriating and unsuccessful trial. He was buried in the cathedral of Jamaica, beneath a black marble slab. Family Lynch married firstly, Vere, daughter of Sir George Herbert, by whom he had a daughter Philadelphia, wife of Sir Thomas Cotton of the Cotton baronets of Combermere. He married secondly, Mary, daughter of Thomas Temple of Frankton in Warwickshire, but does not seem to have left any children. His widow afterwards married his successor, Colonel Hender Molesworth.

This practice of uploading fake torrents is sometimes carried out by anti-infringement organisations as an attempt to prevent the peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing of copyrighted content, and to gather the IP addresses of downloaders.Cuevas, R. et al. (2010) Is Content Publishing in BitTorrent Altruistic or Profit- Driven?. Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (ACM CoNEXT 2010). Philadelphia, USA. 30 November - 3 December 2010. Methods of attack =Decoy insertion= Decoy insertion (or content pollution) is a method by which corrupted versions of a particular file are inserted into the network. This deters users from finding an uncorrupted version and also increases distribution of the corrupted file.Luo et al (2009). An Effective Early Warning Scheme against Pollution Dissemination for Bittorrent. In: Global Telecommunications Conference, 2009. Honolulu, 30 November ‚Äì 4 December. New Jersey: IEEE. pp. 1 -7. A malicious user pollutes the file by converting it into another format that is indistinguishable from uncorrupted files (e.g. it may have similar or same metadata). In order to entice users to download the decoys, malicious users may make the corrupted file available via high bandwidth connections.Kong, J. et al (2010). A Study of Pollution on Bittorrent. In: The 2nd International Conference on Computer and Automation Engineering. Singapore, 26‚Äì28 February 2010. New Jersey: IEEE. pp. 118-122. This method consumes a large amount of computing resources since the malicious server must respond to a large quantity of requests.Kong, J. et al (2010) The Evaluation of Index Poisoning in BitTorrent. In: D. Wen. et al (eds). Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Communication Software and Networks. Singapore. 26‚Äì28 February 2010. New Jersey: IEEE. pp. 382-386. As a result, queries return principally corrupted copies such as a blank file or executable files infected with a virus.Santos et al (2010). Choking Polluters in Bittorrent File Sharing Communities. Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS) 2010. Osaka, 19‚Äì23 April 2010. New Jersey: IEEE. pp. 559-566.. There were known cases when a company had created a special version of a game and published it on file sharing services advertising it as cracked, having undocumented hidden functionality, making it impossible to win this variant of the game. =Index poisoning= This method targets the index found in P2P file sharing systems. The index allows users to locate the IP addresses of desired content. Thus, this method of attack makes searching difficult for network users. The attacker inserts a large amount of invalid information into the index to prevent users from finding the correct resource. Invalid information could include random content identifiers or fake IP addresses and port numbers. When a user attempts to download the corrupted content, the server will fail to establish a connection due to the large volume of invalid information. Users will then waste time trying to establish a connection with bogus users thus increasing the average time it takes to download the file. The index poisoning attack requires less bandwidth and server resources than decoy insertion. Furthermore, the attacker does not have to transfer files nor respond to requests. For this reason, index poisoning requires less effort than other methods of attack. =Spoofing= Some companies that disrupt P2P file sharing on behalf of content providers create their own software in order to launch attacks. MediaDefender has written their own program which directs users to non-existent locations via bogus search results. As users typically select one of the top five search results only, this method requires users to persevere beyond their initial failed attempts to locate the desired file. The idea is that many users will simply give up their search through frustration. =Interdiction= This method of attack prevents distributors from serving users and thus slows P2P file sharing. The attacker‚Äôs servers constantly connect to the desired file, which floods the provider‚Äôs upstream bandwidth and prevents other users from downloading the file. =Selective content poisoning= Selective content poisoning (also known as proactive or discriminatory content poisoning) attempts to detect copyright violators while allowing legitimate users to continue to enjoy the service provided by an open P2P network. The protocol identifies a peer with its endpoint address while the file index format is changed to incorporate a digital signature. A peer authentication protocol can then establish the legitimacy of a peer when she downloads and uploads files. Using identity based signatures, the system enables each peer to identify infringing users without the need for communication with a central authority. The protocol then sends poisoned chunks to these detected users requesting a copyright protected file only. If all legitimate users simply deny download requests from known infringers, the latter can usually accumulate clean chunks from colluders (paid peers who share content with others without authorization). However, this method of content poisoning forces illegitimate users to discard even clean chunks, prolonging their download time. Voluntary Collective Licensing and the Open Music Model are theoretical systems where users pay a subscription fee for access to a file-sharing network, and are able to legally download and distribute copyright content.von Lohmann, F. (2008) A Better Way Forward: Voluntary Collective Licensing of Music File Sharing. Electronic Frontier Foundation. Retrieved 2011-04-22. Selective content poisoning could potentially be used here to limit access to legitimate and subscribed users, by providing poisoned content to non-subscribed users who attempt to illegitimately use the network.Lou, X., Hwang, K. and Zhou, R. (2007) Integrated Copyright Protection in Peer-to-Peer Networks. In: 27th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW'07). Toronto, Canada. 22‚Äì29 June 2007. p. 28 =Eclipse attack= The eclipse attack (also known as routing-table poisoning), instead of poisoning the network, targets requesting peers directly. In this attack, the attacker takes over the peer‚Äôs routing table so that they are unable to communicate with any other peer except the attacker. As the attacker replicates the whole network for the targeted peer, they can manipulate them in a number of ways. For example, the attacker can specify which search results are returned. The attacker can also modify file comments. The peer‚Äôs requests can also be directed back into the network by the attacker and can also be modified. It also checks data randomly for any errors found in that.Locher, T. et al. (2010) Poisoning the Kad Network. In: Kant, K. et al (eds). Distributed Computing and Networking. Heidelberg: Springer. pp. 195-206. =Uncooperative- peer attack= In this attack, the attacker joins the targeted swarm and establishes connections with many peers. However, the attacker never provides any chunks (authentic or otherwise) to the peers. A common version of this attack is the \\"chatty peer\\" attack. The attacker establishes connection with targeted peers via the required handshake message, followed by a message advertising that they have a number of available chunks. Not only does the attacker never provide any chunks, they also repeatedly resend the handshake and message. These attacks prevent downloads as, essentially, the peer wastes time dealing with the attacker, instead of downloading chunks from others.Dhungel, P. et al.

Berkeley: USENIX. p.7. Barriers to torrent poisoning There are several reasons why content providers and copyright holders may not choose torrent poisoning as a method for guarding their content. First, before injecting decoys, content providers have to normally monitor the BitTorrent network for signs that their content is being illegally shared (this includes watching for variations of files and files in compressed formats). This process can be expensive and time-consuming. As a result, most poisoning is only continued for the first few months following a leak or release.Anderson, N. (2007). Peer-to-peer poisoners: A tour of MediaDefender. Ars Technica. Retrieved 2011-03-30. Second, it is also unlikely that torrent poisoning can be successful in disrupting every illegal download. Instead, the aim of content providers is to make illegal downloads statistically less likely to be clean and complete, in the hope that users will be discouraged from illegally downloading copyright material. Content providers and copyright holders may decide that the financial outlay is not worth the end result of their efforts. = Countermeasures = The methods of attack described above are not particularly effective on their own, as for each measure effective countermeasures have evolved. These measures must be combined in order to have a significant impact on illegal peer-to-peer filesharing using BitTorrent protocols and Torrent files. * BitTorrent is highly resistant to content poisoning (as opposed to index poisoning), as it is able to verify individual file chunks.Lou, X. & Hwang, K. (2006). Adaptive Content Poisoning To Prevent Illegal File Distribution in P2P Networks Retrieved 2011-03-21. Overall, BitTorrent is one of the most resistant P2P filesharing methods to poisoning.Lou, X. and Hwang, K. (2009) Collusive Piracy Prevention in P2P Content Delivery Networks. IEEE Transactions on Computers. 58 (7) pp. 970-983. * On private tracker websites, where all posted torrents can be traced to a particular member, poisoned torrents can be quickly labeled and deleted and the poster can be banned, preventing further introduction of poisoned torrents by that user. * Public torrent tracker sites have enabled the ability to report if a torrent has been poisoned (or is fake or malicious in any way). Thus torrent files shared by public trackers can have similar levels of quality assurance as Private Tracker websites. * Tracker technology (as well as BitTorrent client programs) has improved over time, and many kinds of spoofing that were possible in the past are no longer possible. * BitTorrent was once an exclusively TCP-IP protocol, but this is no longer true. Use of UDP, with the uTP protocol has made TCP Man in the Middle attacks more difficult to nearly impossible. * Public or Private tracker websites have selectively switched over to using HTTPS for the distribution of their web text and image content. By using HTTPS for the website content (versus tracker communications) many poisoning techniques are rendered impossible. =Legal issues= In September 2004, Altnet sued the Recording Industry Association of America, Overpeer, Loudeye, MediaSentry and others, claiming that their spoofing services violated Altnet's patent for a file identification method called TrueNames.Cowley, S.

In the USA in 2002, Representative Howard Berman proposed the Peer To Peer Piracy Prevention Act, which would have granted immunity to copyright holders for taking steps to prevent the illegal distribution of their content (i.e. poisoning activities) on P2P networks, as long as they did not go as far as to harm the files stored on a P2P user's computer.Berman, H.L.

Founded in 1965 by Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong. History Established in 1965 as Sanpokong Catholic College, the school is a government subsidized grammar school for boys, under the sponsorship of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong. Before moving into the new premises, with consent of the school authority of Choi Hung Estate Catholic Secondary School (CHESS), CHECSS was partially used by Ng Wah School in its first year of operation, with a total of 480 junior form students (S1 to S3) in 12 classes. On 30 March 1966, the present site in San Po Kong were completed and were inaugurated by the then Governor of Hong Kong, Sir David Trench on 14 April 1966. After a donation by Mr. Ng Ping Kin, an architect and Urban Councillor, the school was renamed Ng Wah College in commemoration of his father, Mr. Ng Wah (Chinese: ‰ºçËèØ). In the late 1970s, the rooftop of the secondary school building was modified and became the 6th floor to accommodate the then expanding student population. In 1986, three standard classrooms were also in place in the covered playground. Under the School Improvement Project scheme, a new six-storey annex was built connected the primary school building near Choi Hung Rd. in 2000. In the same year, the three classrooms in the covered playground were converted into a bigger multi- purpose Student Activity Room. Starting from September 2002, the school was renamed as Ng Wah Catholic Secondary School in accordance with the naming system of schools under the sponsorship of the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese. Admission 75% of Ng Wah Catholic Secondary School's total Form 1 intake is from its feeder school, Ng Wah Catholic Primary School, with 25% from other primary schools Motto The School Motto is Latin phrase \\"IN CONSILIO SAPIENTIA\\", which means \\"To think conscientiously and to discern with intelligence\\" in English.

The Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission was established after independence in 2015. The country currently operates a TRIGA research reactor at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Savar.http://www.aere.org.bd/ More recently, in 2001 Bangladesh adopted a national Nuclear Power Action Plan. On 24 June 2007, Bangladesh's government announced plans to build a nuclear power plant to meet electricity shortages. In May 2010, Bangladesh entered into a civilian nuclear agreement with the Russian Federation. It also has framework agreements for peaceful nuclear energy applications with the US, France and China. In February 2011, Bangladesh reached an agreement with Russia to build the 2,000 megawatt (MW) Ruppur Nuclear Power Plant with two reactors, each of which will generate 1,200 MW of power. The nuclear power plant will be built at Ruppur, on the banks of the Padma River, in the Ishwardi subdistrict of Pabna, in the northwest of the country. The RNPP is estimated to cost up to US$2 billion, and start operating by 2021. The inter-governmental agreement (IGA) was officially signed on 2 November 2011. Adjusted cost for construction and commissioning of the Ruppur plant is $12.65 billion. On 29 May 2013 Bangladesh's Prime Minister declared that a second nuclear power plant will be constructed on an inland river island in southern region of the country.  Background  For Bangladesh, which is a historically agrarian country, the agricultural sector has shrunk from over 30% in the 1980s to under 20% a decade into the millennium. On the other hand, industry is growing from under 20% in the 1980s to over 30% currently. With highly industry national economy, the generation of electricity will be linearly related to the national GDP. With lesser agriculture and more industry, not only more emissions will be given off to the atmosphere but lack of trees and plants will hinder any chance of carbon sequestration. The underdeveloped and mismanaged energy infrastructure of Bangladesh has inhibited economic growth (See: Electricity sector in Bangladesh). With a derated capacity of around 5500 Megawatt (MW) on an installed rating of over 6000 MW, only around 4000 is actually available. With a maximum generation of 4500 MW in mid-2010 to 4700 MW in late 2010, the peak is anywhere from 5700 MW to 6000 MW and only about 40% to 48% of the total population have access to electricity. The per capita consumption of 218-230 kWh and the availability is the lower among any developing country in the world.  Current energy sources  The main source of national energy is in its natural gas reserves 55% of it goes to the power generation sector while 27% goes to factories and industry, 10% to household purposes and 5% in the automotive sector. Furthermore, the government has a targeted six, 5-year plans from 2010 to 2021 where it would try to produce 8,500 MW in 2013, 11,500 MW in 2015 and 20,000 MW by 2021. It is a part of the ‚ÄòDigital Bangladesh‚Äô scheme's Vision 21 where the government would seek universal electrification around the nation. The plan also targets an increase in domestic and important coal based power plants, and more on-shore or off-shore gas exploration. Ruppur Nuclear Power Plant Implementation Project (RNNP) is also one such scheme to reach an addition capacity of 9000 MW. Currently, around 88% of energy used for power generation is from natural gas sources and 4% from coal, 6% from oil and just 2% from Hydro-based power plants in Chittagong. Renewable Energy sources are totally excluded from any contributions. By 2021, the target plans to reduce gas imports to 30%, while raising coal contributions to 53%. This will have disastrous effects. Finally by 2030, renewable energy contributions would by increased to a mere 6%, while nuclear power was increased to around 30%. Waste disposal There are arguments in favor of nuclear energy when compared to the use of coal. For example, a single 1000 MW coal-fired plant produces over 300,000 tons of ash, 44,000 tons of sulphur dioxide, 22,000 tons of Nitrous Oxide and 6 million tons of carbon. In contrast, a 1000 MW of nuclear power plant produces 3 cubic meters of waste after reprocessing the spent fuel, 300 tons of radioactive waste and 0.20 tons of plutonium. However, a unit ton of nuclear waste is far more dangerous than the same amount of coal-fired plant waste, if not managed properly. At the same time, dealing with nuclear wastes is more expensive. Nuclear waste disposal will be managed by Radioactive Waste Management Company, to be formed according to Bangladesh government‚Äôs National Policy on Radioactive Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel Management-2019. Bangladesh plans to store nuclear waste for a given period, after which the waste will be brought to Russia. Spent fuel may be reprocessed in Russia for fast breeder reactors. = Costs = There are also different transport requirements for both nuclear fuel and fossil fuels in the context of Bangladesh. Transportation costs are higher for coal and oil systems at 20,000 train cars or 10 supertankers, in relation to a nuclear plant at just 3‚Äì4 trucks. Around the world, there is projected to be around 860 nuclear power plants generating over 800,000 MW. As of 2018, the estimated cost for waste management, disposal, and decommissioning has not been released. = Disaster management = According to the 4th IPCC, climate change in the region of the project area could cause exacerbate significant river erosion, deposition and flooding which would be of concern. River erosion is a significant hazard along all of Bangladesh's rivers which destroys land and critical infrastructure continually, rendering thousands homeless and displaced every year. The site area immediately downstream from the Indian border is in addition vulnerable to unilateral bank protection construction.

It is the result of an ambitious plan of restoration and reclamation on the outskirts of the city that seeks to recover the ecological and social value of this space through the creation of a nature tour around the city articulated by various enclaves of high ecological value and landscape. It is the result of a project which began in the early 1990s and was selected by the UN among the 100 best global performances of the III International Competition \\"Best Practices for improving the living conditions of the cities\\", held in Dubai in the year 2000.

History  Casa de la Dehesa, seat of the Environmental Studies Center The idea of the Green Belt came in the early 1990s in order to provide a comprehensive solution to the problems of the urban periphery of Vitoria-Gasteiz and the general state of disrepair that the area presented. When the project began, on the outskirts of the city coexisted with high ecological value areas such as forests or Zabalgana Armentia that, although affected by problems of erosion, fire ... had managed to survive the urban and industrial expansion of the city, with gravel pits, dumps and other degraded sites that threatened the fragile survival of relict existing natural enclaves. The area offered a precarious and insecure to stay and ride, having become a physical and social barrier between the urban and rural adjacent. To address existing problems and convert and / or enhance the value, if any, the suburbs, and residual clearly undervalued, Environmental Studies Center of the City of Vitoria-Gasteiz decided to undertake a large-scale project that encompasses all the periphery of the city and provide a solution to both areas operated as natural enclaves. It was basically to create a network of suburban green spaces, an idea also found support and rationale within the management framework established by the General Urban Plan of 1986 that it proposed extending the system of urban green areas to areas peripherals.  Parks  = Alegria = Situated between the river Zadorra and wetlands of Salburua, the river Alegr√≠a and its banks represent today an important ecological corridor between these two valuable ecosystems, allowing the movement of such representative species as the European mink. It is a space for leisure activities, which connects the periurban Salburua park with the future fluvial park of the river Zadorra, in the Gamarra area. = Armentia = Picnic site in the Armentia Forest This is a large natural oak forest, located between the city and the Mountains of Vitoria, the main mountain range and one of the most valuable natural areas in the municipality of Vitoria-Gasteiz.Sitio web del Ayuntamiento de Vitoria- Gasteiz - Anillo Verde de Vitoria-Gasteiz - Parque de Armentia Precisely its location makes the Forest of Armentia a real biological corridor between the forest areas, green areas and peri-urban ecosystem, and in this paper lies the main value Armentia Park. =Ol√°rizu= Olarizu mountain, Casa de la Dehesa and Olarizu meadows Olarizu Meadows Deer in the Green Ring The fields open stands of Ol√°rizu, an iconic mountain and the many trails that run through there and connects the city with the nearby towns, make this park a popular spot that is ideal for walking or just stay (in authorized areas).Sitio web del Ayuntamiento de Vitoria-Gasteiz - Anillo Verde de Vitoria-Gasteiz - Parque de Olarizu Unlike the other parks in the Green Belt, Olarizu Park has a \\"less natural\\" and closer to the typically urban park concept, as it is with this character as originally conceived.

The park can be visited through various routes that surround and connect major gaps. Facilities include the 'Interpretation Centre ATARIA' and two bird observatories. =Zabalgana= This park is the result of an intensive restoration process, which has become an area of old gravel pits, very degraded, in an area of natural interest suitable for leisure and recreation of the population.Sitio web del Ayuntamiento de Vitoria-Gasteiz - Anillo Verde de Vitoria-Gasteiz - Parque de Zabalgana In the park of Zabalgana there are alternating meadows, scattered woodlots, ponds, small hills and ridges, sitting areas, trails and natural forest gall; it is a forest-island surrounded by a sea of crops. =Zadorra= The Zadorra river runs along the north part of the city acting as a limit to the city's expansion.Sitio web del Ayuntamiento de Vitoria-Gasteiz - Anillo Verde de Vitoria-Gasteiz - Parque del Zadorra Holder of important natural values that have motivated his statement as space SCI (Site of Community Interest) within the European Natura 2000 Network of Protected Natural Spaces, the Zadorra and its surroundings are an ideal space for walks. In the near future it will be possible to have an extensive river park 13 km long and a surface of 213 ha, which will act as a key link in the Green Ring, including wetlands and Salburua and Zabalgana.  Future expansions =Errekaleor= The future park is bounded on the south Olarizu Park and north to wetlands Salburua, being included within the new residential expansion Salburua.Sitio web del Ayuntamiento de Vitoria-Gasteiz - Anillo Verde de Vitoria-Gasteiz - Parque de Errekaleor Its location makes this place an important connecting element between the Green Belt parks located south and east of the city. The river Errekaleor ensure ecological connectivity while the Cerro de Las Neveras, noteworthy from the standpoint of landscape, will be included in the Green Belt as a promenade a must for great views. The design of this environment, which is provided as part of the redevelopment project of Salburua, will involve the expansion of the area of the Green Ring in 28 hectares.  Objectives  * Promote the conservation of natural sites and ecological restoration per other recoverable peripheral areas, creating a natural continuum around the city. * Integrate suburban parks in the urban fabric, while connecting with the natural environment, thus improving the accessibility and environmental security among urban green areas and natural areas of the municipality. * Put up the suburbs to promote the public use them, helping to meet the public demand for more outdoor recreation while lessening the pressure on other fragile natural areas. * Take advantage of the recovery and conditioning of new spaces to promote awareness and environmental education with the last attempt to involve citizens in conservation.  Maintenance  Green Belt trail marking There is a permanent maintenance service in the Green Belt that monitors the state of conservation of the plants in the Parks including the mowing of grass and treed meadows, irrigation, digging, fertilising, hoeing, pruning, replacing dead plants, sowing and planting, as well as other related tasks. There is also a service responsible for maintaining the equipment and signposting in the Green Belt. Its work includes ensuring that these are kept in the best possible state of conservation, as well as the repair, refitting and replacement of damaged equipment due to normal wear and tear or due to accidents or vandalism. The overall maintenance of the Belt includes a general cleaning service that comprises the clearing of riverbanks after periods of flooding, the removal of rubbish and graffiti from signposts and equipment and other tasks.

Durand, Director of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, received incomplete reports that a French engineer named Auguste Rateau was attempting to develop engines for high altitudes using a turbo-driven air compressor. Durand remembered Moss as a graduate student who worked on gas driven turbo engines twenty years earlier at Cornell before starting a career at the gas turbine division of General Electric. Durand wrote to the president of GE, Edwin W. Rice, requesting Moss' services: ::\\"Dear Mr. Rice: ::At the present time in connection with the development of the airplane and the Liberty engine for driving same, there is no problem which is perhaps more seriously before the Government officials than that of maintaining at high altitudes the power of the engine. In this connection we are especially desirous of developing the possibilities of a pre-compression of the air before going to the engine carburetor, thus maintaining, as nearly as may be, constant conditions regarding pressure at all altitudes. ::In this connection we believe that your Dr. Sanford A. Moss could be of very great service in advising with us regarding the possibilities of pre-compression as applied to this problem, and I have written informally to Dr. Moss inviting his attention to the problem as outlined. ::I desire, therefore, to ask your approval of the request, and that, if possible, you will authorize Dr. Moss to give such attention to this problem as may be necessary in order to give us the results of his experience in the study of such matters. ::Thanking you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter, I remain, -\\" After this turbochargers became Moss' life work. Moss built a high-RPM supercharger, driven by engine exhaust flow, and tested it in 1918 at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. As a result of this test, the government awarded its first supercharger contract to GE. Later in 1918 Moss attached his turbo-supercharger to a Liberty V-12 aero engine and tested it near Pikes Peak. The test engine was able to maintain far higher air intake-charge densities at high altitude than an unassisted Liberty Engine. Moss installed s 356 hp turbocharged engine on a LePere LUSAC biplane, which set international performance records, including in 1921 an altitude mark in excess of 40,000 feet; more than double LePere's operational ceiling. After his retirement from GE in 1938, Moss was awarded the Collier Trophy, presented by the National Aeronautic Association in 1940 for his work on the turbocharger. Moss was an aviation consultant to the Army and, in 1942, worked with Washington and GE as the company secretly created the 1-A, the first workable jet aircraft engine, using the turbine principles that Moss had first researched. He died on November 10, 1946 in Lynn, Massachusetts at 74 years of age. References 1872 births 1946 deaths National Aviation Hall of Fame inductees Howard N.

Before that, capital punishment was last used in the 19th century. Under the principle of independence of legal system in Macau Basic Law, Macau continues its repudiation of capital punishment after the handover to The People's Republic of China in 1999 despite the fact that capital punishment is practised in The People's Republic of China. Macau was a Portuguese colony prior to returning to Chinese rule. Macau abided by the laws of their colonisers prior to their transfer. After the transfer of sovereignty, Macau developed their own laws. These laws were based largely upon the Portuguese laws. The final death sentence was handed some time during the 19th century. Although capital punishment is prohibited in Macau, the process of extradition to The People's Republic of China and other countries is still permitted. The Hong Kong protests of 2019 have caused questions around the extradition of criminals from The People's Republic of China‚Äôs special administrative regions including Macau. This has caused responses from activists in Macau, who have joined the protests in Hong Kong. The Criminal Code of Macau dictates the penalties and rules regarding offences within the country. None of the articles present in the criminal code allow for the capital punishment as penalty for an offence. The Portuguese government did not permit the revoking of freedom via punishment. The government believed that every individual deserved freedom, thus abolishing capital punishment and life imprisonment. These sentiments were included in the law of Macau whilst colonised. The law regarding capital punishment was allowed to be retained when the country was transferred under the one country, two systems law. The longest sentence in the Macau legal system is 30 years. Background Macau served as a colony of Portugal for a total of 442 years before returning to The People's Republic of China. Macau is currently a special administrative region that resides under the control of The People's Republic of China. Languages spoken in Macau include both Portuguese and Chinese. The legal systems present within modern day Macau are structured in a similar manner to the legal systems of Portugal. As a special administrative region, the government of Macau is able to dictate their own legal system. The level of autonomy of Macau does not include military action or diplomacy. These affairs are handled by the government of The People's Republic of China. Whilst under Portuguese rule, capital punishment was abolished in Macau. After the turnover of Macau to The People's Republic of China, Macau opted to maintain their policy on capital punishment. Although both Macau and Hong Kong exist as special administrative regions of The People's Republic of China, their state of independence is recognized differently. This differs in their policies on capital punishment. The independence of Macau is recognised through their basic law. The basic law of Macau was created and established in 1993. The basic law of Macau is legally allowed to act independently of the constitutional law of The People's Republic of China. Although Macau is a special administrative region of The People's Republic of China, permanent residency within the country is controlled by Chinese law as a means to protect the independent state. Corruption and crime are prevalent within Macau, especially in policing and casino businesses. Organised crime is extremely prevalent in the region. The casino business of Macau accounts for a large proportion of the GDP of the country. The government of Macau promotes responsible gambling to its citizens and to tourists to keep the revenue flow consistently high. The rate of crime in Macau is relatively low in comparison to cities of similar size in The United States of America. Criminal Law The basic law of Macau was established upon returning to The People‚Äôs Republic of China and allows Macau to function autonomously as a region of China. This allows Macao to independently enforce their jurisdiction under the one country, two systems policy of The People‚Äôs Republic of China. Within the basic law of Macau, articles dealing with crime exist. * Article 85 of the basic law of Macau states that the Portuguese system of prosecution and arrest will continue to be used within Macau. * Article 80 states that the Chief Executive of the country has the authority to excuse offences. * Article 32 states that authorities may forego freedom of privacy when investigating crime within Macao. * Article 29 details the right to court trial upon being charged with an offence and that offenders found to be guilty will be punished according to the law. * The Criminal code of Macau outlines the penalties handed to individuals for breaking the law. The Criminal code covers disobedience, false statements, false testimonials, penalties, bribery to falsely testify and offering bribes. * Criminal Law in Macau prohibits capital punishment and life imprisonment in the country. Imprisonment within Macau depends of the severity of the crime, with imprisonment being capped at a maximum of 30 years. Shorter sentences may be increased in the case of an offender committing similar offences upon being released. Extradition Laws Extradition in Macau is governed by criminal law and constitutes the transfer of criminals between Macau and other countries of the world. The law of extradition in Macau is known as the Surrender of Fugitive Offenders. Extradition can occur through the signing of a treaty or through negotiations without a treaty. Extradition from Macau requires there to be a state of ‚Äòdual criminality‚Äô, whereby the offender has committed a crime that both Macao and the requesting country recognise as a crime. Evidence must be provided when negotiating extradition to prove the criminality of the offender. Macau‚Äôs chief executive has the power to accept extradition without evidence in the event that he sees reason in doing so. Reasons exist for the declining of extradition request. In the event that Macau is currently investigating the offender when an extradition request arrives, Macau is liable to decline the request. Similarly, Macau may deny the request if it plans to launch an investigation on the matter but has not yet done so. As capital punishment is prohibited within Macau, the country has reason to reject extradition requests in the event that the country said offender is being extradited plans to impose capital punishment on the offender. Other policies are set that control and organise the procedures that need to be undertaken in order for extradition to occur from Macau. The People‚Äôs Republic of China has undertaken forced rendition of citizens who have escaped to Macau and subjected some to the death penalty. Criminal Activity in Macau Casino Lisboa Pictured at NightCrime in Macau increased during the handover period between Portugal and The People's Republic of China, particularly in terms of organised crime. The People's Republic of China attempted to settle the problems within Macau through different measures of intervention. The police system of Macao underwent an overhaul upon the transfer of the country from Portugal to The People's Republic of China. This overhaul proved effective in combatting crime within the country and maintaining peace. This overhaul served to increase the public trust in the police through more transparent communication. Social activists in Macau and protesting suggests that a further development to the policing system will be required before transparency and accountability for actions may be reached. As of 2011, crime rates in Macao have remained at a stable low. The overhaul of the policing system has incorporated both situational and social crime prevention methods into the Macau policing operation. The Casino businesses of Macau are one of its greatest economical assets. These casinos are rampant with criminal activity, particularly activity relating to organised crime. The Department of the Investigation of Gaming-Related and Economic Crimes is a division of the Macao police force that presides criminal activity relating to casinos. The penal code of Macau is the document that dictates the laws and policies regarding criminal activities and the punishment these activities bring. Max sentences are very rarely dealt upon criminals and are reserved for heinous crimes. The penal code states specific laws and punishments regarding major crimes such as terrorism, human trafficking, money laundering, and drug distribution or drug related criminal activity. Cross border criminal activity was prevalent prior to the handover of Macau to The People‚Äôs Republic of China, but was heavily regulated by the Chinese government after 1999. Close to 11,000 criminal incidents occurred within Macau in the year 2009, all of which were reported to and dealt with by the judiciary police, a sub-division of the Macau police force. According to statistics gathered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Macau‚Äôs crime rates against citizens per 100,000 citizens was 462 and rates of homicide per 100,000 citizens sat close to a value of 1. Casino Lisboa pictured during the day =Organised Crime in Macau= The Casino business was heavily regulated and organised crime groups were prosecuted during the handover of Macau to The People's Republic of China. Triad based organised crime was prevalent in Macau prior to the year 2000, particularly in casinos within the country. Conflicts between triad groups over territory threatened the country of Macau and its people in the 1990s. Conflicts involved various triad groups vying for control of the Macau casinos to increase the funds of the crime groups through business. Violence was commonly used as a threat towards opposing organised crime groups during this period. The government of Macau has organised a tactical unit division of the police force that aims to target and deal with serious crime and violence within the country. Actions to attain money and offer protections by organised crime groups included triad leaders running VIP lounges, where high money bets were able to be made under the protection of the crime group. Other crimes included money laundering, scamming and blackmail. If convicted of crimes relating to these subjects, a maximum 3-year jail sentence may be delivered. Organised crime group VIP rooms are beneficial to casino revenue in Macau. Organised crime groups offer loans to individuals who lose money on gambling, putting them in debt to the crime group. This keeps individuals gambling in the casino for longer, increasing the revenue of the business. Some VIP rooms are still being run by triad leaders, even after the overhaul of the policing system. The number of gambling related crimes increased threefold between 2002 and 2009, with a little over 1600 cases of these crimes occurring throughout 2009. Social crime present in casinos threatened public order in Macau, resulting in heavier regulatory efforts by the government. These crimes do not carry incredibly heavy sentences but make up a large portion of crimes in Macao. Issues with Capital Punishment Laws Issues relating to the capital punishment laws between Macau and The People‚Äôs Republic of China have previously arisen, resulting in negotiations occurring relating to jurisdiction. The government of The People‚Äôs Republic of China has decided that the country of Macau‚Äôs stance towards capital punishment may remain for as long as Macau deems it is necessary. =Public Opinion= Patriotism towards The People‚Äôs Republic of China is prevalent in Macao. It is possible that the laws regarding capital punishment in Macau could be overhauled when The People‚Äôs Republic of China regains control of Macau as a result of this patriotism. Protests and backlash would likely arise if an overhaul is to take place. Public opinion towards the government of Macau is divided. Some individuals are unhappy with the election of leaders being done through committee voting rather than a vote by the populace. The public has recommended that polls be conducted to investigate citizen opinion on policies being constructed and put forth. Policies that take into consideration the opinion of the public will lead to increased trust towards the governing body. The policies referred to include crime, housing, business laws and others. As of 2001, 54.9% of individuals in Macao that were surveyed indicated that they disapprove of the governments idea to punish serious crimes prior to a trial occurring. A majority of the public seeks to see a fair criminal system that functions without the need for capital punishment as a sentence. Still, a large proportion of surveyed civilians indicated that they were afraid of chaos resulting in Macau as a result of serious crime occurrence. These surveyed civilians indicated that they would prefer that there was intervention prior to trial occurrence in order to prevent the disruption of regular social life in Macau. Perceptions towards this varied by age group, with 72% of university students disagreeing with the previously mentioned issue.

The facility is the first nuclear reactor in the country. It will provide radioactive isotopes for medical usage in Jordan, and will provide training for students at the University to produce a skilled workforce for the country's planned commercial nuclear reactors. In 2018, the Commission announced that Jordan was in talks with multiple companies to build the country's first commercial nuclear plant, a Helium-cooled reactor that is scheduled for completion by 2025. Jordan has signed memorandums of understanding with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Japan, China, Russia, Spain, South Korea, Argentina, Romania, and Turkey, for assisting Jordan with nuclear power and uranium mining. Nuclear power plans In 2007, Jordan's Committee for Nuclear Strategy was formed in order to start the development of nuclear programs in Jordan. Its ultimate goal is for nuclear power to provide 30% of Jordan's electricity by 2030, and to provide electricity for export. From this program, the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission and the Jordan Nuclear Regulatory Commission were developed. Also in 2007, Jordan announced a plan which would help develop a civic nuclear program. This nuclear program would assist in diversifying Jordan's energy portfolio, which would help reduce Jordan's dependence on energy imports, which currently consumes one fifth of GDP. During the era of Saddam Hussein, Jordan was forced to rely on receiving oil at a reduced price from Iraq. The invasion by the United States in 2003 interrupted the deals and forced Jordan to look elsewhere for oil, so Jordan turned to Egypt for oil and gas. The Arab Spring and the 2011 ousting of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak interrupted this supply of oil, setting Jordan back further in their energy crisis. Jordan has since become dependent on gas imports from Israel, which are highly unpopular in Jordan. In April 2012 the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission shortened the list from seven to two possible reactor vendors. The two vendors have been narrowed down to Areva-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Russia's AtomStroyExport. The reactor technology has yet to be decided upon, however, the tentative deadline for this decision is set in the middle of May 2014. The research reactor will become a focal point for a Nuclear Technology Centre, which will train upcoming generations of nuclear engineers and scientists in the Kingdom in addition to provide irradiation services for the industrial, agricultural and medical sectors. In March 2013, Jordan received approval to begin construction on the Jordan Research and Training Reactor at the Jordan University of Science and Technology. The approximate cost of the reactor is $130 million, with at least $70 million being loaned by the South Korean government. In 2018, the Commission announced that Jordan was in talks with multiple companies to build the country's first commercial nuclear plant, a Helium-cooled reactor that is scheduled for completion by 2025. Jordan has also granted Areva exclusive mining rights for uranium in central Jordan. International relations Jordan has relied on international cooperation to access nuclear technology. In order to become a nuclear nation, Jordan has had to sign numerous agreements and create new relations with countries throughout the world. Jordan has signed memorandums of understanding with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Japan, China, Russia, Spain, South Korea, Argentina, Romania, and Turkey. In December 2009, Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) in cooperation with a consortium headed by the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute signed an agreement with Daewoo Heavy Industries to build its first research reactor by 2014 at the Jordan University of Science and Technology. Jordan is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which promotes peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Jordan takes its commitment to this treaty seriously and thus aims to pursue an internationally approved path to obtaining nuclear energy. In October 2013 the Russian VVER-1000 design was selected in a competitive tender for Jordan's first twin reactor nuclear power station. As recently as April, 2014, King Abdullah II met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a possible Jordanian-Russian nuclear cooperation. Environmental concerns =Anti- nuclear campaigns= As the Jordanian government moves closer to the development of nuclear power plants, the local anti-nuclear movement has picked up steam. The movement is led by Basel Burgan, an environmentalist and activist who heads the National Campaign, an anti-nuclear energy non-profit. The National Campaign stresses the idea that the nuclear power plants would contaminate Jordan's scarce water supply. Greenpeace Jordan is also influential in Jordan's anti-nuclear movement. Greenpeace Jordan has encouraged the government to entertain the idea of creating an energy policy based on renewable resources. In 2013, Greenpeace Jordan published the \\"Future of Energy of Jordan\\" report to raise concerns about nuclear energy‚Äîespecially water and seismic issues‚Äîand advocate for increased use of renewable energy sources. Greenpeace Jordan believes that Jordan will be able to meet 100% of its energy needs with renewables by 2050. Opponents of nuclear energy are particularly concerned about nuclear power plants' impacts on Jordan's water supply. Jordan is the fourth water-poorest country in the world, and has less than 15% of the UN water poverty line. One possible site for a reactor would be above the Azraq Aquifer, which supplies most of Amman's freshwater. Environmentalists caution that a minor accident at the plant could poison up to 1/3 of the water in the country. Jordan is already facing rapid depletion of water resources, questioning if the country can afford to take the risk of building these power plants. Jordan's Federation for Environmental Societies has used Jordan's lack of water resources as a platform for their anti-nuclear views. The lack of water has also raised concerns about the cooling of the reactors, which would consume approximately 500 million cubic meters of water annually.

Stapleford is located between Waterford and Watton-at-Stone in the Beane valley; the little river was forded at this point, giving rise to the village. Stapleford's parish church is St Mary's Church.A Church Near You St Mary's Stapleford Beane is a hamlet of Stapleford. History The placename occurs as Stapelford in an Exchequer document of 1210, lending weight to Walter William Skeat's suggestion that the ford site was marked by an upright stake, in Anglo-Saxon stapel.Skeat, The Place-names of Hertfordshire, 1904:27f. In the early 1970s, John Marius Wilson described Stapleford as: > \\"a parish in the district and county of Hertford; 2¬æ miles N of Hertford r. > station. It has a post-office under Hertford.

The church was repaired and enlarged in 1852. There is a national > school. In 1831, majority of males were labourers and servants whilst the remaining were employers and professionals or into middling sorts or other occupations, this shows the social status of males in Stapleford during those times. Stapleford's population is 567 according to 2011 census which includes 286 males and 281 females. Statistics In the 1880s majority of the men's occupation was within agriculture, whereas women were more into the domestic service. The professional occupation had the fewest people working within that sector for both genders. According to the Office of National Statistics, 67% of Stapleford's population are Christian.The following 26% classify themselves as nonreligious, 5% did not state their religious preference and the rest are the other religions. The village has many churches to accommodate to the Christians.The Office of National Statistics show that the people of Stapleford generally have very good health with 299 out of 567 classified as having very good health and the next big group having good health. As a whole the health rate is high, despite the 18 individuals who either have bad health or very bad health. The health rate in this area suggests that the village has very good health care sector. Lastly, information published by the 2011 Census stated that the largest ethnic group is White British, as 537 out of 567 people are of this ethnicity showing that the village is not multicultural. left =Occupation= From the Occupational Structure of Males Pie Chart, it is seen that during 1881, 57% of the men's occupation was within agriculture showing that the area was rural. There were other occupations during that time but not as major as the agricultural sector. Within the Occupational structure for Females, 51% are in an Unknown Occupation this is most likely classified as being a Housewife which would be common during these times, as majority of other work was very physical, thus the demanding jobs would be for men. The next sector with the highest percentage of females was within Domestic Service. Occupational Structure of Males reported by the census reports from Vision of Britain centre =Population= Census reports from 1880s to 2011 have illustrated within the \\"Total Population of Stapleford\\" graph that during 1880 to 1920 population growth was reasonably stable within 200 people. Thereafter, population growth increased by more than a half to 500 people by 1960 and then by 2011 increased by less than 100 people to reach the 2011 population of 567 people. The population demographic in Stapleford has seen in the past the: > mortality decline in the late 19th century was mainly due to the reduction > of very high infant mortality rates: the presence or absence of large number > of infants dying before their first birthday had little effect on overall > age structures. During the twentieth century, declining fertility and > improved life expectancy in later life significantly changed age structures. thumb Transport For transportation, the village has to rely on cars or vans, however, in the past Stapleford, had a railway station for 15 years which made transportation easier, but had to close down due to accidents and incidents occurring. 2011 census data shows that only 19 out of 229 households do not have a car or van. On the other hand, the remaining households do have 1 or more cars, with 105 households having 2 cars or vans.

On 26 August 1958, then Israeli Finance Minister Levi Eshkol announced the government's intention to build a nuclear power plant.

In January 2007, Israeli Infrastructure Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said his country should consider producing nuclear power for civilian purposes. As a result of the nuclear power emergencies at Japan's Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on March 17, 2011, \\"I don't think we're going to pursue civil nuclear energy in the coming years.\\"Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu: Japan situation has \\"caused me to reconsider\\" nuclear power Piers Morgan on CNN, published 2011-03-17, accessed 2011-03-17Israeli PM cancels plan to build nuclear plant, Xinhuanet, published 2011-03-18, accessed 2011-03-17Netanyahu: We'll reconsider nuclear power plans Ynetnews, published 2011-03-18, accessed 2011-03-17 , the Ministry of National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Resources is considering nuclear power in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2030.Energy Ministry mulls nuclear power plant for Israel Globes, published 2015-11-26, accessed 2015-11-26 =Factors affecting nuclear power in Israel= Several factors have contributed to the fact that no nuclear power plants have been built in Israel over the years. One is the fact that the Israel is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which makes it more difficult for the country to engage with international suppliers of nuclear technology. Another reason is that very large deposits of natural gas have been found offshore the Israeli coastline beginning in the 2010s. The exploitation of these deposits allow for generating electricity at very cost-effective rates as compared to generating electricity using nuclear power. =Potential site= Since the 1980s, a site near Shivta in the Negev desert has been designated as the future location of a nuclear power plant. Previously, a site near Nitzanim on the Mediterranean coast was considered but was rejected in the 1970s due to strong opposition from nearby residents.

Fossils found in Scotland were initially described as Cooksonia caledonica. A later review, which included new and more complete fossils from Brazil, showed that the specimens did not fit the circumscription of the genus Cooksonia; accordingly a new genus Aberlemnia was proposed. Description Fossils from which the genus was first described were found in the Aberlemno quarry, Scotland. Other fossils now assigned to Aberlemnia caledonica have been found in Wales, Brazil and possibly Bolivia. Plants consisted of smooth leafless stems (axes) up to 1.4 mm wide, decreasing in width at each branching. Specimens branched up to five times, at angles between 25 and 55¬∞, mainly dichotomously, although those from Brazil had some trichotomies. Spore- forming organs or sporangia were borne at the ends of the stems. Individual sporangia varied in shape. Smaller ones were more or less circular in outline, larger ones were kidney-shaped (reniform), up to 2 mm high and 3 mm wide. The difference in shape is interpreted as being due to growth and maturation. To release their spores, the sporangia split into two valves along the border opposite to the stem on which they were attached (i.e. distally). Taxonomy Specimens were first attributed to Cooksonia caledonica by Edwards in 1970. According to a review of the genus Cooksonia by Gonez and Gerrienne, the sporangium of the type species (C. pertoni) is formed by a widening of the end of a stem. At maturity the sporangium is topped by a flattish disk (an operculum) and releases its spores when this breaks up. The sporangia of C. caledonica are quite different. No existing genus was considered to cover the precise morphology of this plant, so that a new genus Aberlemnia was put forward. The name is based on the location where the first fossils were found, Aberlemno in Scotland. In 2013, Hao and Xue classified Aberlemnia as a rhyniopsid, in the subgroup they called \\"renalioids\\", along with Renalia and Hsua. Phylogeny Gonez and Gerrienne consider that Cooksonia is the most basal of the stem group of the lycophytes, whereas their genus Aberlemnia diverged later and is more derived. Consistent with this position, the genus has a combination of inherited features or plesiomorphies, such as dichotomous branching and terminal sporangia, with more advanced features, such as bivalved sporangia, which are characteristic of the lycophytes. A cladistic study in which they included the two best-characterized species of Cooksonia, C. paranensis and C. pertonii, together with Aberlemnia caledonica (then still called C. caledonica) produced the following cladogram: See also *Devonian *List of Early Devonian land plants References Early Devonian plants Fossil taxa described in 2010 Prehistoric plant genera ","title":"Aberlemnia"},{"id":"31201488","text":"List of bids for the Olympic Games include: * List of bids for the Summer Olympics * List of bids for the Winter Olympics * List of bids for the Youth Olympics ","title":"Lists of bids for the Olympic Games"},{"id":"31201493","text":"Sir Edmund Bowyer (12 May 1552 ‚Äì 18 February 1627) was an English lawyer, landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1593 and 1624.

He was a FIFA Executive Committee member from 1996 to 2013, the CONCACAF General Secretary from 1990 until 2011, and Executive Vice President of the U.S. Soccer Federation. In 2013, Blazer admitted to conspiring with other FIFA Executive Committee members to accept bribes in conjunction with the failed bid of Morocco and the successful bid of South Africa to become World Cup hosts in 1998 and 2010, respectively. His admissions came during testimony given at a sealed sentencing proceeding in a New York federal court. Early life Blazer grew up in a middle-class Jewish family in the New York borough of Queens, where his father ran a stationery and newspaper shop. He attended Forest Hills High School and then took an accountancy degree at New York University. After graduating, he enrolled at NYU's Stern School of Business but did not complete his MBA.Papenfuss, Mary & Thompson, Teri, \\"American Huckster How Chuck Blazer got Rich From‚ÄîAnd Sold Out‚ÄîThe Most Powerful Cabal in World Sports,\\" Harper Collins, 2016, pp 12-15 He then spent a number of years selling promotional and marketing items; a first success was supplying buttons for the Smiley craze in the 1970s. When his son started playing youth soccer in Westchester County, New York, in 1976, Blazer started coaching the team even though he had never played the game. He is remembered as a skillful and active administrator, more interested in organizing than coaching. He advanced in youth soccer administration up to the Eastern New York State Soccer Association. Career In 1984, persuading Pel√© to campaign for him, he was elected to the United States Soccer Federation as executive vice president in charge of international competition. In the next two years the US men's soccer team played 19 matches, having played only two in the two years before Blazer's election. While with U.S. soccer, Blazer played a central role in the decision to make the successful bid for the 1994 World Cup. Also during this time, the U.S. women's soccer team was formed. Blazer's position gave him a seat on the board of CONCACAF, where he met Jack Warner. In 1986, after failing to win re-election, he co-founded the American Soccer League, running it from his home. It lasted only two years, with Blazer being forced out by the owners who felt they had been kept in the dark about finances. He became president of the Miami Sharks, taking control of the finances, only to leave precipitously after five months in May 1989. In 1989, Blazer convinced Jack Warner to run for CONCACAF president. Blazer managed Warner's successful campaign and was then appointed General Secretary. He was the General Secretary of CONCACAF from 1990 until 2011. He was a member of the FIFA Executive Committee from 1996 to April 2013, when Sunil Gulati was elected to replace him. Corruption allegations and conviction In May 2011, in response to allegations of bribery made by national representatives attending a May 10 meeting of the Caribbean Football Union (CFU), Blazer initiated an investigation of AFC President Mohammed bin Hammam and FIFA Vice President Jack Warner. The investigation was conducted by John P. Collins, former United States federal prosecutor and FIFA Legal Committee member. Its submission led to FIFA's May 29, 2011, suspension of Warner and Bin Hammam from all soccer activities, pending the outcome of FIFA's own investigation and procedures.Bahamian Whistle Blower Applauded, Repeating Islands, repeatingislands.com, May 31, 2011 Acting CONCACAF president Lisle Austin attempted to fire Blazer five days later, but the action was blocked by the CONCACAF executive committee.Associated Press, \\"CONCACAF stymies attempt to fire Blazer\\", Japan Times, June 2, 2011, p. 18. On June 15, 2011, Blazer was questioned by the FIFA Ethics Committee. On August 14, 2011, journalist Andrew Jennings noted in the British newspaper The Independent that the FBI was examining documentary evidence revealing confidential soccer payments to offshore accounts operated by Blazer. He began working undercover for the FBI in December 2011. On April 19, 2013, Blazer and Jack Warner were accused of massive fraud during their years as CONCACAF executives. A forensic audit by the organization's Integrity Committee determined that both men had functioned without a written contract from 1998 until their respective departures, and that Blazer had received US$15 million in commissions for his services during that time frame. An anonymous government source expected that an ongoing FBI investigation into Blazer's finances would be expanded significantly and joined by the IRS. In May 2013, Blazer was suspended for 90 days. On November 1, 2014, it was reported (by the New York Daily News \\"Soccer Rat! The inside story of how Chuck Blazer, ex-U.S. soccer executive and FIFA bigwig, became a confidential informant for the FBI,\\" Teri Thompson, Mary Papenfuss, Christian Red, Nathaniel Vinton, NY Daily News 1 Nov 2014) that Blazer had been a confidential informant for the FBI and the IRS, and recorded key meetings between executives for FIFA and for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Blazer was compelled to inform for the FBI and IRS after they uncovered more than a decade of unpaid taxes on hidden, multimillion-dollar incomes.\\"Chuck Blazer, a Soccer Bon Vivant Laid Low\\", nytimes.com, May 27, 2015. On May 27, 2015, several FIFA officials were arrested in Zurich, with Blazer having been a key cooperating witness in the investigation that led to the arrests. In exchange for his cooperation, Blazer agreed to plead guilty to charges that include racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and money laundering. Blazer died before being sentenced. The delay in sentencing was caused by the decisions of his co-defendants to go to trial. On June 3, 2015, the transcript of a closed sentencing proceeding (which occurred in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on November 25, 2013) was unsealed and made public. In his 2013 testimony, Blazer admitted to conspiring with other FIFA Executive Committee members to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of 1998 and 2010 World Cup hosts. On July 9, 2015, Blazer received a lifetime ban from FIFA from all soccer-related activity. Death Blazer died on July 12, 2017, of colorectal cancer at a New Jersey hospital at the age of 72. At the time of his death, he also suffered from coronary artery disease and diabetes.

He was member of a Hamas cell run by a relative, Ibrahim Ghanimat, who was finally captured in 2005. The cell, sometimes called the \\"Surif squad\\", is also responsible for several other attacks against Israeli targets. It was believed at least at some point during the investigations that the perpetrator had no intention to die as a suicide bomber, but that the timing device misfired.  Aftermath  The memorial built at the site of the event in memory of the victims of the attack Following the attack, the Israeli Military Intelligence Directorate found for the first time clear evidence which proved that the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was encouraging and initiating militant attacks on Israeli civilians within Israel in order to advance the negotiations with Israel. A monument has been placed near the site of the attack which was created by the artist Eliezer Weishoff. The monument depicts three roses which were cut off. The attack is remembered among the Israeli public, in part, due to the picture taken of a six-month-old infant girl in a clown costume who survived the attack because she was saved by her mother, who protected her with her body from the force of the blast. In January 2015, the child from the photograph, since identified as Shani Winter, joined the Israeli Defense Forces, accompanied by the same traffic policewoman who carried her in the photo.

He was the Kentucky state geologist from 1880 to 1893, and president of the United States Civil Service Commission from 1893 to 1903. Biography His mother died when he was very young, and he was brought up by an aunt. When he showed an inclination to enlist in the Confederate Army, his aunt sent him to the University of Pennsylvania to prevent this. He spent freshman year in a science program there, and then left and enlisted as a Confederate in 1863. He served until the end of the war. At the close of the war, he returned to his home farm in Kentucky, where he remained until 1873. In 1873 he met Kentucky state geologist Nathaniel Shaler, also a Harvard professor. Procter became assistant in the Kentucky Geological Survey, and also studied geology during 1875 at Harvard. In 1880 he succeeded Shaler as state geologist. As state geologist, he was brought into contact with the spoils system, to which his opposition was so uncompromising ‚Äî he refused, even at the request of members of the state legislature, to remove competent assistants for political reasons ‚Äî that he finally lost his position in 1893 when the Governor of Kentucky finally refused the support Procter which had received from that office in the past. Allegedly the Governor wanted to make some appointments for political and personal reasons. Procter had resisted these appointments advising that the geological survey office be closed rather than make it a machine to be used to advance political interests by letting out the offices for partisan ends. His struggle with the spoils system brought him to national attention, and in the same year, at the recommendation of Theodore Roosevelt, Procter was appointed by President Grover Cleveland as president of the Civil Service Commission, a post which he held till his death. Procter's criticism of the spoils system was based not only on its evil moral and social effects, but also on its absurdity as a method of conducting business. He presented this view constantly and effectively. His work as president of the Commission was the means of increasing the effectiveness of the civil service, and of gaining for it recognition in political life. During Procter's service on the Commission, the number of positions subject to the merit system increased from 43,000 to 120,000. In 1896, Procter secured the release of the positions of chief clerks and chiefs of divisions from the spoils system and had them filled by promotions or transfers from within the classified service. Procter served as a member of the Jury of Awards at the Chicago World's Fair, and was a frequent contributor to magazines and journals on geologic, economic, international and political subjects. He was a member of the Century Club of New York City. He died of angina pectoris while at the Cosmos Club in Washington, D. C., where he was attending the annual meeting of the National Civil Service Reform League.

She was renamed Ibrahim-El-Awal later in 1951. In 1956, Ibrahim el Awal took part in the naval operations during the Suez crisis, and on 30 October 1956, she was dispatched to Haifa with the aim of shelling that city‚Äôs coastal oil installations. On 31 October she reached Haifa and began bombarding the city with her four 102 mm (4 inch) guns.

The thorax of the adults is covered by dense orange-brown hair, while each abdominal segment has an apical orangey hair-band. This species is very similar to the closely related heather colletes (Colletes succinctus) and even more to the sea aster mining bee (Colletes halophilus).Michael Kuhlmann, George R.Else, Anna Dawson, Donald L.J.Quicke Molecular, biogeographical and phenological evidence for the existence of three western European sibling species in the Colletes succinctus group (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Organisms Diversity & Evolution - Volume 7, Issue 2, 2 August 2007, Pages 155-165 Biology The adults emerge late in the year (the males from late August and the females a little later in early September) and remain on the wing until early November. The principal pollen forage plant is ivy (Hedera helix) (hence the specific epithet hederae), but both sexes will also nectar at ivy flowers too. When ivy is scarce, other species of plants are also visited. The females supply the larval brood cells almost exclusively with nectar and pollen of ivy flowers. When ivy flowering is delayed, females may also collect pollen at various members of the Daisy family (Asteraceae). These are solitary bees and do not live in colonies and do not overwinter as adults. They nest in clay-sandy soils, especially in loess hills and soft-rock cliffs. Like many other solitary bees, they can often be found nesting in dense aggregations, sometimes numbering many tens of thousands of nests. In parts of the west European range of the species, Colletes hederae are frequently parasitized by the larvae of the meloid beetle Stenoria analis, which feed on the supply of nectar and pollen prepared by females bees in their nests.

The Marxist theories of socialism, communism, class struggle, ideology and political economy influenced early Soviet-era filmmakers such as Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein. Eisenstein's theory of montage owed its \\"intellectual basis to Marxist dialectics\\". However, in addition to his philosophical influence on 20th century cinema and film-makers, Marx's life and times and his principal works have all been represented in film as subjects in their own right. Eisenstein's project, dating from 1927, to film Marx's book Das Kapital was never realised, although in more recent years the German film director and author Alexander Kluge completed a lengthy homage to Eisenstein's unrealised film entitled News from Ideological Antiquity: Marx ‚Äì Eisenstein ‚Äì Das Kapital. In the 1960s French new wave directors, notably Jean-Luc Godard, used Marxist themes in their work, including in the films Week End, La Chinoise and Tout va bien. In the 1970s the Serbian director Du≈°an Makavejev made films which were critical and/or satirical of Marx and Marxist ideology. The Young Karl Marx by the Haitian director Raoul Peck released in 2017 traces events in the life of young Marx in the 1840s until the writing of Communist Manifesto and has been positively reviewed by Peter Bradshaw who thought the film absorbing. The 2011 documentary film Marx Reloaded combines a Marxian analysis of economic crisis with satirical animation sequences involving Marx and Leon Trotsky. Year as Long as Life Year as Long as Life (Russian: –ì–æ–¥ –∫–∞–∫ –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å) is a USSR widescreen biopic completed in 1966 about the lives of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The film was directed by Azerbayzhana Mambetova and Grigori Roshal. The film covers one year of the lives of Karl Marx (Igor Kvasha) and Friedrich Engels (Andrei Mironov). The script is also based on a novel by Galina Serebryakova. The film tells about the complex and interesting period in the life of Marx and Engels following the Revolution of 1848. It begins with the narrative of the publication of The Communist Manifesto. After the French Revolution, Marx is expelled from Belgium, and after the start of the revolution in Germany, he moves to Cologne and tries to support the comrades' publication of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Then Marx, persecuted by the authorities for their views, must flee with his family to London. Marx und Engels - Stationen ihres Lebens In 1978 an 11 part documentary series was produced in the GDR with the name Marx und Engels - Stationen ihres Lebens (Marx and Engels - stations of their lives), featuring many acted scenes of Marx and Engels life. Week End Jean-Luc Godard's Week End is a story of a bourgeois Parisian husband and wife who decide to escape to the countryside for the weekend only to be confronted there by the social contradictions of their consumer lifestyle. The film makes frequent references to Marx and revolution, reflecting the wider social issues in France at the time of its production.See David Sterritt, The Films of Jean-Luc Godard: Seeing the Invisible (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 83. Sweet Movie In Sweet Movie, directed by Du≈°an Makavejev, a boat with a giant Karl Marx figurehead sailing along a river is a consistent narrative motif. The film includes several characters, such as 'Mr. Kapital' (played by John Vernon), who refer to Marx and Marxist themes. News from Ideological Antiquity Helge Schneider as Karl Marx Alexander Kluge's News from Ideological Antiquity: Marx ‚Äì Eisenstein ‚Äì Das Kapital, is an experimental film which explores ‚Äúthe Marxian attention to the production, distribution and consumption at work behind the phenomenological surface of everyday life and experience.‚Äù The film is composed of what the Marxist critic Frederic Jameson calls \\"fragments\\", akin to \\"Freudian free association\\", rather than a conventional and linear narrative. Instead of representing Marx's book Capital, the film is therefore a study of the difficulty facing Eisenstein, or any other director, in trying to represent such a work and the ideas contained in it. Apart from the more conceptual passages in the film ‚Äì whose overall running time is a lengthy 570 minutes ‚Äì comedian Helge Schneider impersonates Marx in several scenes. Marx Reloaded Marx Reloaded, written and directed by the British theorist Jason Barker, is a partly animated documentary film which investigates the contemporary relevance of Marx's ideas in the context of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. The film asks whether \\"(we) should ... accept the crisis as an unfortunate side-effect of the free market\\" or whether there is \\"another explanation as to why it happened and its likely effects on our society, our economy and our whole way of life.\\" The film interviews several leading Marx-inspired philosophers and critics including Michael Hardt, Antonio Negri, Nina Power, Jacques Ranci√®re, Peter Sloterdijk, Alberto Toscano and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. In addition to its Marxian analysis the film follows \\"The Matrix-themed cartoon adventures of Karl Marx, lost in an Alice-style commodity-induced nightmare with only one way out.\\" Monty Python's Flying Circus At least two episodes of the BBC TV comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus include sketches depicting Marx in modern-day settings, and which lampoon the presumed gravity of his thinking.

He controlled the National Liberation Army and the Free Libyan Air Force from March to May 2011. He served on the council Executive Board before being replaced by Jalal al- Digheily, and he headed Military Affairs in the unicameral National Transitional Council legislature. El-Hariri was involved in the initial 1969 coup against the monarchy that began Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule of Libya. He organised a plot to overthrow Gaddafi in 1975. When the coup was uncovered, 300 men were arrested, four of whom died during interrogation. Of the remainder, 21 were sentenced to death, including El-Hariri. He was imprisoned for 15 years from 1975 to 1990 under a death sentence, with four and a half years in solitary confinement. Gaddafi commuted the sentence in 1990 and El- Hariri was subsequently placed under house arrest until the Libyan civil war broke out in 2011. After breaking free of his detention, El-Hariri eventually became the political head of the National Transitional Council's armed forces. In an interview with The Globe and Mail, El-Hariri said of Libya's future, \\"They will elect a new president and he will serve for a limited time. He could be removed if he does not serve the people.

This plan enables eligible citizens to purchase homes by way of \\"rent-and- buy\\". The Plan aims to provide assistance to potential sandwich class home buyers who are able to repay mortgages in the long term but currently do not have enough savings for the down payment. This plan is introduced by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong in the Policy address of Hong Kong 2010.Hong Kong Policy Address 2010-11 The implementation of plan, that is the first 5000 flats under the plan is expected to be ready for sell in 2014.News from Hong Kong's Information Service Department on 9 March 2011 Under this Plan, the Hong Kong Housing Society will lease the flats to eligible applicants at prevailing market rates.Hong Kong Housing Society The tenancy period will be up to five years, within which the rent will stay put. After an occupation period of two years, tenants may purchase the flat they rent or another flat under the Plan at prevailing market price, or a flat on the private market. They will receive a subsidy equivalent to half of the net rental they have paid during the tenancy period, and use it for part of the down payment. Upon maturity of the five-year period, tenants will have to move out but still consider purchasing a flat within a period of two years. My Home Purchase Plan has reserved five sites (i.e. Tsing Yi, Diamond Hill, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Tuen Mun in building 5000 subsidized housing.)Economy News 13 October 2010 Housings under this plan, is only exclusively for family applicants that have a household income of less than $39,000 a month and assets of no more than $600,000. The major target of the Plan are the \\"White Form\\" applicants while \\"Green Form\\" and singleton applicants will also be allocated certain quota.White Form Eligibility, Hong Kong Housing Authority Green Form Definition, Hong Kong Housing Authority The first pilot project of My Home Purchase Plan is at Tsing Luk Street in Tsing Yi, and is estimated to have provide 1000 flats.  Background  The private residential property prices has increased by 19% from September 2009 to September 2010, this phenomenon is attributable to the progressive economic recovery, low interest rate environment and the relatively tight supply of private residential flats in the past few years. The mortgage-to-income ratio in the second quarter was 41%, though it was lower than the average ratio of 53% over the past 20 years. This figure reveals the concern of the public on the recent increase on property prices. As the price of housing property in Hong Kong is skyrocketing, the amount of available mass market flats at affordable prices and overall supply of land for flat production in the long term is worrying. The Transport and Housing Bureau (THB) conducted a series of public consultations.The Transport and Housing Bureau Opinions on whether to subsidize home ownership were collected from May to 17 September 2010. Stakeholders and members of the public engage through different channels to look at matters related to the subject, in order to identify a way that can reassure concerns of the public. The outcome of the public consultation showed that a lot of people are concerned about the rise in property prices and the difficulties in purchasing their first flat.www.thb.gov.hk The Hong Kong Government recognizes the importance of home ownership to the public. It is the common will of the people to secure a stable home and to improve their quality of life. The Legislative Council of Hong Kong is of the view that the Government should introduce measures to help the sandwich class purchase their own flats, regarding the high property price. It is asserted that providing relief measures to sandwich class home buyers to give them time to save up is suitable. As a result, the Government, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), will introduce My Home Purchase Plan.  The Government's Housing Policy Objectives  The Government's housing policy objectives are as follows ‚Äì = (A) To provide subsidised rental housing for families in need = The Government‚Äôs housing policy remains as \\"delivering the overarching objective of providing subsidised rental housing for families in need must continue to sit at the very heart of the Government‚Äôs housing strategy.\\" This was announced in the \\"Statement on Housing Policy\\" by the then Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands in November 2002. Hence, the government‚Äôs commitment to the provision of public rental housing (PRH) has not been changed. = (B) To uphold minimal market intervention = Taking into account the government‚Äôs policy of minimal market intervention, other than PRH, the Government will continue to withdraw as far as possible from housing assistance programmes. Under the minimal intervention approach, the government is firmly committed to provide a fair and stable operating environment for the sake of the healthy development of the private property market. Moreover, efforts are made to enhance the transparency of sales information and fairness of transactions of first-hand private residential properties in order to protect consumers‚Äô rights; = (C) To maintain the steady development of property market = It must be stressed that the Government place utmost importance in the home ownership needs of the Hong Kong citizens. This can be achieved by the government continuing to ensure a steady supply of land so that the residential property market can develop in a steady and healthy manner with low pressure of rising price. = (D) To nurture the \\"can-do\\" spirit of Hong Kong people = It is recognized that home ownership is a matter of personal choice which is greatly related to individual circumstances and affordability. The Government is wary that any type of assistance provided should not erode the key to Hong Kong‚Äôs success and the core of Hong Kong‚Äôs values, the \\"can-do\\" spirit of Hong Kong people. Thus, the Government will facilitate the provision of different housing options for different sectors of the community, rather than going back to the property market. Relevant policies includes working with the HKHS to implement a new form of assisted home ownership premised on the concept of \\"rent-and- buy\\". The new scheme of \\"My Home Purchase Plan\\", together with measures introduced to improve the transparency and fairness of first-hand sales in the private sector, and the revitalisation measures for the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) Secondary Market Scheme (SMS), will increase choice to meet the different housing needs of the community in a sustainable manner.HOS, The Hong Kong Housing AuthorityJointGoal Surveyors  Content  In this plan, Hong Kong government is going to give land to the Hong Kong Housing Society so as to construe flats of small and medium size for lease to qualified applicants at the current market rent. Without raising the rent within the period, the tenants can live in the flat at most for five years. During the period in which two years are passed after the first admission of the tenants, they have two choices: to purchase the flat they are living or alternatively another flat provided by My Home Purchase Plan at current market price, or else flats of private housing estate. Purchase Subsidy which is equal to half of the net rent will be provided. On the contrary, Purchase Subsidy will not be provided for the tenants who have not bought any flat under My Home Purchase Plan or in the private housing market within certain period of time.  Merits  =(A) Flexibility = (i) Sandwich class people without enough savings for down payment can rent a flat, and then buy their own house later under MHPP. (ii) Rental flats for a maximum five years will be provided so they can have enough time to ponder over their plan of buying houses and do not have to make careless decisions on purchase of flat. Therefore, they will bear lower risks. = (B) Helps accumulate savings = As the rent will remain unchanged within the rental period, the tenants can take time to save up their money for down payment, which is the most difficult to be saved up. = (C) Greater upward mobility in the property market = The majority of the quota will be allocated to White Form applicants, and the remaining quota will be allocated to PRH tenants. It will help the PRH turnover. = (D) Complements market inadequacy = (i) HKHS is a non-profit-making, which provides flats with high efficiency. (ii) MHPP flats help fill the shortage of \\"no-frills\\" in the primary private market.  Eligibility Criteria  GF applicants and WF applicants are eligible to apply for MHPP if they meet the eligibility criteria. There will not be any restrictions on income and asset of the tenants of PRH estates and GF applicants, but if their application under MHPP succeeds, after they have moved into the flats under MHPP, they will be ordered to give the PRH units to the Housing Authority or HKHS. However, WF applicants would have to meet the laid-down asset and income limits. Preliminary proposal on the income and asset limits is ‚Äì (a) Household applicants‚Äô upper income limit is about $39,000 per month, and the upper asset limit is about $600,000; and (b) Singleton applicants‚Äô upper income limit is about $23,000 per month, and the upper asset limit is about $300,000. In the future, HKHS will investigate and with regard the then market situation, set the income and asset limits, before it accepts applications for pre-letting of the Tsing Luk Street project. First-time homebuyers are the targets of the scheme. Meanwhile, there will be strict criteria.

It is famous because of the archaeological remains, like a Roman temple converted in a Byzantine fortress. History The Neolithic settlements represented at Labweh have been found dating to at least the 7th millennium BC. It has been suggested that it was known to the Egyptians as Lab'u, to the Assyrians as Laba'u and as Lebo-hamath to the Hebrews. This has been associated with the \\"entrance of Hamath\\" mentioned in the Books of Kings and the Book of Ezekiel, noted as the Northern border of King Solomon's territory, but subsequently lost to the Syrians. Jeroboam II, king of Israel, is said to have \\"restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah (the Dead Sea)\\".: NKJV translation; cf. NIV translation, which refers to the Dead Sea Labweh in the original Syriac tongue means \\"heart\\" or \\"center\\", it also has been suggested to come from the Arabic for \\"lion\\" or \\"lioness\\". The village has several archaeological sites of interest including three old caves with Roman-Byzantine sarcophagi and the remains of a temple. There are also remains of a Byzantine bastion and a Roman dam suggested to date to the reign of Queen Zenobia. Legend suggests that channels were carved through the rock to send water to her lands in Palmyra, Syria.Ba'albeck - Al-Hermal, Bekaa - Tourist Brochure In 1838, Eli Smith noted Lebweh as a Metawileh village in the Baalbek District.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 145 Labweh Springs and Labweh River The village is located on a hill northeast of Baalbek, which gives its name to the Labweh Springs and Labweh River, one of the sources of the Orontes. The Labweh river flows for approximately through rocky desert. It then cascades into a lake and wider stream at another village called Er-Ras, considered to be the source of the Orontes. This flows onwards northeast, fed by numerous other streams from Lebanon's mountains.Sir. William Smith, LLD, Ed. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) Archaeological sites Soundings and analysis of archaeological sites in Labweh were made by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe in 1966 with later excavations by Diana Kirkbride in 1969. Tell Labweh, Tell Labweh South or Labweh I sits to the south of the village with another site to the north. The surface of Tell Labweh had been damaged by modern agriculture and it had been cut in half by road construction. Several burials were discovered inside the remains of rectangular buildings with white and red plaster floors. The remains of stone walls were found at lower levels and it is thought that the buildings may have used mud bricks at higher levels. Early neolithic finds included a large number of fragments of limestone White Ware or \\"Vaisselle Blanche\\", along with later pottery called dark faced burnished ware or DFBW. Only one vessel was reconstructed from the initial excavations; a bowl with combed finishing. Other shards included jars and bowls of a black, brown or red colour, one showed a straw wiped finish normally found in sites further South in the Jordan Valley. Others showed decorations such as chevrons, incised patterns and corded impressions. Flints were similar to those found at Tell Ramad and included Byblos points, hooks, scrapers, borers and burins. Burials were found within two houses, which were excavated and found to be similar to those in earlier PPNB and PPNA sites. A range of sickle blades were found in the basal deposits and higher levels showing the evolution of denticulated and segmented cutting edges with similarities to those found at the oldest neolithic Byblos. Three initial samples were Radiocarbon dated suggesting a range of dates between 6780 and 6910 BC; a date range covering only c. 130 years.University of Cologne - Radiocarbon Context Database The range of finds at the site has however helped to reveal some aspects of the transition through neolithic stages. Tell Labweh North is another large archaeological site, a few hundred metres north on the other side of the village and springs. Finely denticulated sickle blades, arrowheads and trapezoidal, flaked axes and fragments of white ware along with burnished pottery with patterns and a fragment of obsidian were collected from the surface of the site. Most of the finds indicated settlement around the time of Tell Labweh (South) and Byblos. Fauna would have included forest animals and numerous domesticated cattle, sheep and goats. Roman temple There are the ruins of a Roman temple in the village that are included in a group of Temples of the Beqaa Valley. Remains of a Roman temple, later converted in a Byzantine fortress It was a prostyle type but only one block of the western wall remained visible. Modern construction built a house inside the temple. There are around twenty temples located between Labweh and Ain el- Baid. George F. Taylor divided up the Temples of Lebanon into three groups, one covering the Beqaa valley north of the road from Beirut to Damascus. Secondly a group to the south, including the Wadi al-Taym known as Temples of Mount Hermon. Thirdly a group in the area west of a line drawn along the ridge of Mount Lebanon. The Temples of the Beqaa Valley in Taylor's first group included Labweh, Yammoune, Qasr Banat, Iaat, Nahle, Baalbek, Hadet, Kasr Neba, Temnin el-Foka, Nebi Ham, Saraain El Faouqa, Niha, Hosn Niha, Fourzol and Kafr Zebad.George Taylor (1971). \\"The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide\\".

Description The height of the shell attains 23 mm, its diameter 26 mm. The imperforate, solid, thick shell is subglobose. The short spire is conoid. The shell contains 4 to 5 whorls. The penultimate and last whorl are quite convex, the last descending, more or less concave just below the linear suture. The young shells are obsoletely spirally lirate, their sculpture disappearing with age. The coloration consists of numerous narrow red or orange zones alternating with bands of light green articulated with black. The oblique aperture is round-ovate. The outer lip is finely plicate within. The basal lip is thickened and plicate. The short columella terminates in an acute tooth. The middle of the columellar area contains a longitudinal semilunar groove, frequently irregularly curved. The basal notch or canal is oblique, squarish, wider than deep, and not denticulate in the middle. There is great variation in color in this species. In some specimens red predominates, in others green. And often the general effect is an olive shade. There is usually a subsutural series of light and dark dashes.

Illustration of Jasminum didymum by Harriet Anne Thiselton-Dyer for Curtis's Botanical Magazine, 1878. Drawing of the twigs, foliage, and flowers of Dendrosicyos socotranus. The two lower left elements were copied from another source (Schweinfurth), but all the others were drawn by Harriet Anne Thiselton-Dyer from dried specimens. Life and career Harriet Anne Hooker was born in 1854 to the botanist and explorer Joseph Dalton Hooker and Frances Harriet Henslow, who was the daughter of botanist and Cambridge University professor John Stevens Henslow. In 1877 she married the botanist William Turner Thiselton-Dyer (later knighted), with whom she had a son and a daughter. Thiselton-Dyer belonged to a generation of English women who transformed their interest in botany into professional careers. She studied with the noted botanical illustrator Walter Hood Fitch, who was the lead artist for Curtis's Botanical Magazine. After Fitch resigned from the magazine in 1877 following a dispute with her father‚Äîfor whom Fitch had been preparing illustrations for several books‚ÄîThiselton-Dyer stepped in. She rendered almost 100 illustrations for publication during the period 1878‚Äì1880, helping to keep the magazine viable until Matilda Smith took over as lead illustrator. In 1894‚Äì95, Thiselton-Dyer painted some 550 copies of Brazilian botanist Jo√£o Barbosa Rodrigues's orchid paintings, which had been lent to her by the botanist Alfred Cogniaux, who was using some of them to illustrate a work on Brazilian flora. Unfortunately, the original drawings disappeared in Brazil sometime after Rodrigues's death and are now lost, making Thiselton-Dyer's copies‚Äîhoused at Kew Gardens‚Äîa uniquely valuable resource on Rodrigues's work. In 1996, some of these copies were published to accompany an article on Rodrigues that appeared, fittingly enough, in Curtis's Botanical Magazine. Thiselton-Dyer was also known as an accomplished gardener. In 1905 the Thiselton-Dyers moved to the Cotswolds. When her husband died in 1928, Harriet moved to Devonshire, where she died in 1945. In 2013, Thiselton-Dyer's work was included in the exhibition \\"The Feminine Perspective: Women Artists and Illustrators\\" at the Chicago Botanic Garden, alongside work by Henriette Vincent, Ellen Robbins, and others.

Its founder, John Howell Senior (ca.1825‚àí1893) engineered churches and other public buildings in the area to the designs of innovative architects, including Holy Trinity Church in 1860 to the design of Samuel Sanders Teulon, and St Johns Church, Hollington in 1865‚àí1868 for Edward Alexander Wyon. John Howell Junior (1851‚àí1903) constructed the old Gothic Revival Hastings Grammar School building to the design of Jeffery and Skiller in 1883. Howell Senior was a campaigner on behalf of the Liberal Party and held a prominent political position in the town from the 1860s to the 1880s. He came to Hastings as a fatherless boy, but was the Mayor of Hastings by 1878. John Howell Senior =Personal history= His mother was Sophia Howell of Birmingham, born around 1792. John Howell was born around 1825 in Birmingham, He married Ann Osborne (b. Winchelsea ca.1827; d.

Howell died aged 69 at Hastings on 1 December 1893.Death; John Howell; Dec 1893; Hastings; Vol.2b; p.28. He was born in poverty and was fatherless when he came to Hastings as a child; his life and work were based in Hastings. In boyhood he worked as an apprentice carpenter. In 1841, at age seventeen, he was a carpenter living at White Rock Place, Hastings, with his mother Sophia, a lodging-house keeper, and his sister Sophia (b.ca.1823).Census, 1841. HO 107/1107/10 p.3. He became a journeyman carpenter. In 1851, at the age of twenty-six, he was a carpenter employing nineteen men and living with his wife Ann, aged twenty-four, at 21 White Rock, Hastings.Census1851: HO 107/1635, p.14. He began his independent work by constructing stables for the Local Board in Waterworks Road, Hastings. By 1857 at the age of 33 he was becoming successful: he took on a brickfield at Silverhill and could accept major contracts as one of the town's biggest employers during the expansion of Hastings. In 1861 he was living at 12 Cambridge Gardens with his wife and three children as well as his widowed father-in-law Richard Osborne, two of Osborne's children and a servant, Caroline Phipps, brought from Winchelsea.Census 1861: RG9/560/138, p.42. In 1871 he was forty-six; a timber merchant and contractor employing 120 men. He was living with his wife and children at 50 Havelock Road.Census 1871: RG10/1031/79; p.29. In 1881 he was describing himself as a timber merchant and living with his wife, three unmarried children and three female servants at Priory Mount, Cambridge Gardens.Census 1891: RG11/1026/71; p.59. The Census of 1891 saw him as a widower and retired contractor, staying at the Palace Hotel at Fairfield, Derbyshire with his daughter Ann who was still single at age thirty-eight, and his granddaughter Margery Carless, aged four years.Census 1891: RG12/2778/33; p.7. In spite of his achievements, he was not the major nineteenth-century building contractor in Hastings; that was Peter Jenkins (1869‚àí1899). =Company= The Hastings News said that he was \\"one of the most prominent members of the Victorian building trade (in Hastings)\\", that \\"all he touched seemed to turn to gold,\\" and that \\"he was popular with his workforce for being firm but fair\\". The company's office was in a large sawmill between Station Road and the top of the east side of Middle Street. In October 1864 the Council had to ask Howell to relieve the local nuisance caused by smoke from the sawmill, and in January 1865 the mill suffered from severe subsidence. The Hastings News said that Howell \\"had the building shored with nearly forty timber beams, jacks and hydraulic presses. The building was forced back ten to eleven inches over a period of three days\\". The company organised an annual excursion for the employees: for example on 24 July 1869 seventy men were taken on six wagonettes to the Bell Inn at Northiam,This may be the Hayes Inn at Northiam. leaving early in the morning and returning at midnight. Howell Senior retired in 1882, and the original company was dissolved, although his son continued in business under the same name. =Political life= John Howell Senior became a Liberal Party activist in the campaign against the Corn Laws around 1843 when he was a nineteen-year-old apprentice. He was a lifelong campaigner on behalf of the Liberal Party, and was said to have had an effect in Hastings constituency on the 1859 general election. The Tories alleged corruption by Howell but lost their case. Howell's local influence was believed to have assisted two Liberals, Frederick North and Harry Vane, to win the election instead of one Liberal and one Tory as had been expected. After the 1882 council elections: > \\"The Liberals had issued writs in the High Court of Justice charging Cllrs > Edwin Smith (All Saints ward), George Edmed (St Clements ward) and George > Archibald Thorpe (Holy Trinity ward) with bribery, undue influence, giving > ‚Äòtreats‚Äô and hiring vehicles to convey voters to the polls\\". The Liberals lost their case, but were still supported by the Hastings News, a Liberal newspaper. In response the Tories issued a writ accusing Howell of perjury, citing the method of payment by Howell to Mr Kendal, a private investigator hired to discover evidence of corruption by the Tories in the 1882 election. The Tories were supported by the Hastings Observer, which \\"took great delight in the failure of the Liberal case, highlighting the poor quality evidence\\". The same newspaper \\"also revived the 1869 case, arguing forcefully that the two Liberals had been elected wrongly\\". The Tories lost their case against Howell. Howell was a town councillor in the 1860s and 1870s, although he had to resign as councillor on 11 September 1866 when his tender of ¬£25,640 for the main drainage works was accepted by the Council. He was elected to the first School Board for the borough of Hastings in 1871, and was the first chairman of the Hastings Liberal Association when it was formed in November 1872. He was elected alderman in May 1873, and Mayor of Hastings in 1878. He was elected president of the Liberal Association on 25 January 1883 after he retired from the building business, and was elected councillor representing Holy Trinity Ward on 22 November 1883. This occurred after a husting on 13 September of that year on the cricket ground involving thousands of local people, some bandstands, a fairground, food and an illuminated address to Howell as president of the Hastings Liberal Association. =Works= S.S. Teulon and engineered by Howell Senior, 1860 His first major work was the west side of Warrior Square, completed in 1855. In the same year, Roman coins were found on this site by Howell's workmen. The Music Hall or Central Assembly Room between Robertson Street and Havelock Road, renamed as the Public Hall in 1883, was begun in July 1858 and built speedily; the opening on 12 January 1859 featured Handel's Messiah. It was an Italianate building with its main entrance in Robertson Street. The main hall on the first floor measured 75 feet by 45 feet and 30 feet high, and its staircases gave access to Havelock Road and Robertson Street. The ground floor had a large room for the Hastings Mechanics' Institution at the west end, and shops at the east end, with a shopping arcade running north-south in the centre. There was an arched cellar in the basement. From the 1920s to the 1970s it was a cinema; today it faces Cambridge Road and the ground floor is occupied by public houses, with music in the cellar. Howell built Holy Trinity Church, Robertson Street, in 1860 for architect Samuel Sanders Teulon; the site cost ¬£2,300. The nave was opened on 29 September 1858 and the chancel on 10 August 1862, but it was consecrated as late as 13 April 1882 due to debt. In July of that year there was strike action by the masons when their employer Howell Senior refused to dismiss a non-union man. Holy Trinity is now a listed building. He engineered the basement of the Queens Hotel in 1862; it exists today in the town conservation area without its cupolas and forecourt, and has been converted into flats. E.A. Wyon and engineered by Howell senior in 1865‚àí1868 He also constructed the town‚Äôs main drainage works between 1866 and the summer of 1868, for a fee of ¬£25,640. Work started on 12 October 1866. The system ran \\"from St Leonards Archway via the Priory (near the Memorial) to a large arched tank at Rock-a-Nore holding one and a half million gallons, then to the mouth of an iron outlet pipe off Ecclesbourne Glen\\". People could now experience \\"clean bathing in a pure sea\\": this may explain the necessity for the new drainage system. The work involved embedding planks up to four feet deep into rock. He was the builder of St Johns Church, Hollington, from 1865 to 1868, for architect Edward Alexander Wyon (1842‚Äì1872). St John's Church is not listed. Howell was the engineer for the new Council building to the design of Mr Smith; this could be George Smith who lived at Copthorne. The building was opened in 1868 and stood on the corner of Bank Buildings and Middle Street; now the corner of Middle Street and Station Road. St Andrews Church, Queens Road, was begun in November 1869 and completed to the design of Matthew Edward Habershon; Howell's fee was ¬£3,235. It held a congregation of 2,000 and survived until 1970 when it was declared unsafe and demolished. London and County Bank (now Nat West Bank) He bid unsuccessfully for the job of constructing Hastings Pier in 1869 to 1872. However he did win a major contract for the large-scale development of the Cornwallis Estate in 1873. That job included Cambridge Gardens, Cornwallis Gardens and Holmesdale Gardens; March 1873 saw him already laying out Cambridge Gardens on the site of Priory farmyard, and demonstrating his local influence regarding the positioning of adjacent developments. Howell Senior eventually took up residence on the estate at number seven Holmesdale Gardens and called it Priory Mount. It is now the Westwood Centre. Emmanuel Church, Priory Road (now Vicarage Road), was built to the design of Jeffrey & Skiller in 1873. His fee for this job was paid by a local benefactor, Mrs Mendham, who also laid a memorial stone there. In 1875, he engineered a roller skating rink, later called the Cambridge Hall, on the east side of Cambridge Gardens; the site now contains the ESK Warehouse. It was a \\"large, iron-framed shed with wood panels\\", 120 ft by 60 ft by 27 ft high, and was opened on 1 February 1875. It was built to the design of \\"Mr Plumpton of New York\\" (possibly James Leonard Plimpton) who had designed the skates which would be hired and sold there. His undated buildings include the London and County Bank which is now the National Westminster Bank. He built the St Mary Magdalen Schools; these are as yet unidentified, but one of them may be the listed Training College, Former Convent of the Holy Child Jesus, Hastings, which was designed by William Wardell. They may alternatively be schools built with funds from the Magdalen charity, including Hastings Grammar School. He built the Memorial Chapel which was in Bank Buildings and is now on the west side of Station Road, and numerous domestic buildings. He is credited with the undated construction of The Hastings and East Sussex Liberal Club building at 4 Pelham Street, Hastings; this is now part of Lloyds Bank in Wellington Place.See image of Lloyds Bank, Hastings, here. It was owned by a company, and the Liberals occupied it until it was sold to a judge for ¬£1,700 in 1894. Buildings by both partners Robertson Street Congregational Church, built by both partners, 1884-1885 John Howell Senior's last work built in cooperation with his son was Robertson Street Congregational Church, Hastings, to the design of Henry Ward (1854‚àí1927). It was built mainly in 1884 to 1885 but completed in the 1890s. It is now a United Reformed Church. John Howell Junior =Personal history= John Howell Junior (born Hastings 1851; died Hastings 1903)Death: John Howell Jnr; Hastings; Dec 1903; Vol.2b; p.20. was the son and business partner of John Howell Senior; he also practised as a solicitor. He and his wife Lilla had six children, all born at St Leonards: Cecil John (born around 1884); Gladys Lilian (b.ca.1886); Reginald Edward (b.ca.1887); Mabel E.O. (b.ca.1889; Herbert Edgar (b.ca.1890); Wilfred Douglas. (b.ca.1896). By the time he was nineteen years old in 1871 he was living with his parents in Havelock Road and articled to an attorney. He became a partner in the firm sometime after 1873. By 1881 at age twenty-nine he was describing himself as a timber merchant like his father, and living with his parents at Priory Mount in Cambridge Gardens, Hastings. He continued under the same company name after his father retired in 1882 and the original firm was dissolved. He married Mrs Lilla Harford (b. Barnstaple ca.1856; d. Wandsworth 1930)Death: Lilla Howell; Wandsworth; Sept 1930; Vol.1d; p.462. of Cambridge Gardens, Hastings on 7 June 1882,Marriage; June 1882; St Giles; Vol.1b; p.899. when his employees received a half-day holiday, an afternoon of entertainment at Field's Farm, Ore and an evening dinner at the Grand Hotel in Queens Road, Hastings. Around a hundred of the men took advantage of this. By 1991 the family was living at Rothesay, Clive Road, Hastings, with five of their children: Cecil, Gladys, Reginald, Mabel and Herbert. They had seven servants living in: a housekeeper, parlourmaid, cook, housemaid, under-nurse, coachman and gardener.Census1891: RG12/765/53; p.51. The 1901 Census finds John Howell Junior as a solicitor still living with his wife, his stepson Hugh Cardinal Harford (b. Middlesex ca.1877) and five of their children at Rothesay.Census 1901: RG13/870/66; p.23. His eldest son Cecil was at that time a commercial clerk living at a boarding house in Rochester, Kent.Census 1901: RG13/725; p.22. John Howell Junior died aged 52 years on 13 December 1903 in his home at 20 Holmesdale Gardens which he had built with his father soon after joining the firm. He left ¬£53,352 in his will. The 1911 Census saw Lilla Howell as a widow, living at Preston House, Dulwich Road, Herne Hill, with five of her seven children. Hugh was an insurance inspector; Gladys was a costumier, Reginald was a Lloyds shipping agent, Herbert was a flour merchant and Wilfred was a college student.Census 1911: Schedule 383. Cecil John spent some time in India as a merchant, and 1925 saw him returning home on the SS Warwickshire with his five-year-old son Peter John Howell; they were then living at 27 Pinfold Road, Streatham Hill, London. There is therefore no evidence yet found that John Howell & Son continued as a building or engineering firm after the death of John Howell Junior in 1903. =Works= St Peter's Church, designed by James Brooks and built by John Howell Jnr, 1883‚àí1885 John Howell Junior was the engineer of the previous Gothic Revival building for Hastings Grammar School (pictured above), designed by Jeffery and Skiller of Havelock Road, Hastings. The foundation stone was laid on 15 September 1882, and the first section was opened on 4 July 1883. It was built on a slope using Kentish ragstone and Bath Stone dressings, and shortage of funds meant that it had to be built in stages. In the first stage the building contained a large schoolroom with \\"a raised platform at one end and a gallery at the other; four adjoining classrooms; above, space not yet used as part of the second section; below, a covered playground\\". The second stage, which was never built, was to include accommodation for thirty boarders and a master. The planned capacity was for up to 140 boys, and cost around ¬£10,000. The school ultimately had an eighty-foot tower. Hastings Grammar School moved to a new building on another.much larger, site in 1964 and is now the William Parker Sports College. The 1883 building was demolished in 1973 and the site is now occupied by housing, the road names all being connected to the school. He built St Peter's Church, Lower Park Road, to the design of James Brooks (1825‚Äì1901). The foundation stone was laid in 1883, and it was completed in 1885.

History Listaller was started in December 2007 by freedesktop.org developer Matthias Klumpp as an experimental project to explore the possibility of writing a universal user interface to manage all kinds of Linux software, no matter how it was installed. Therefore, Listaller had backends to manage Autopackage, LOKI, Mojo and native distribution packages. The original project provided one user interface to manage all kinds of installed software. Interaction with the native distribution package management was done via an own abstraction layer, which was later replaced by PackageKit.Launchpad.net announcement: Listaller switches to PackageKit Listaller also provided a cross-distribution software installation format which should have made it easier to create packages which run on multiple distributions. The installer part of Listaller was also able to assist in installing Autopackage packages. The very first versions were written in Object Pascal. Although the project started as an experiment, it soon evolved to a competitor for Autopackage and Mojo. Until 2011, Listaller never made any stable release. With the announcement of AppStream a lot of the original Listaller goals would be achieved, so the author decided to change Listaller away from a full software manager to a software installer only and joined forces with the AppStream project. Because Pascal was not considered as ideal language to collaborate with other projects and the project already had spent much time in developing Pascal bindings to third-party libraries, Listaller was rewritten in Vala with a subset of the original features and the main goal to provide seamless integration with AppStream and PackageKit. Therefore the universal software manager part was removed and the project now focuses on creating a cross-distro format for distribution of binary Linux software. As of Nov 10, 2014 Matthias announced the Limba project.Introducing Limba ‚Äì a software installer experiment LimbaLimba Project is supposed to be Listaller's next version. Methodology Listaller is intended to be used for installing binary, or pre-compiled, versions of non-core applications such as word processors, web browsers, and personal computer games, rather than core libraries and applications such as operating system shells. Listaller is not intended to provide support for installing system libraries for security reasons. Listaller is using an own package format, so-called IPK packages (short for Installation package), which are LZMA-compressed signed tarballs. IPK packages contain only small configuration files to modify the setup process. They do not provide their own logic or scripts which are run during install time. All parts of a setup process are handled by Listaller's built-in routines, which make it possible for distributors to modify the setup process of 3rd-party applications to comply to their own policy, if necessary. The key value of Listaller is integration into desktop environments, existing package management tools and distributions. Therefore, the project provides several integration components by default, which make it possible to manage Listaller- installed 3rd-party applications from any software manager which supports PackageKit and/or AppStream. At time it is discussed to run all installed 3rd- party tools in a Sandbox by default.Developer blog: Listaller - The next steps Programs that use Listaller must also be relocatable, meaning they must be installable to varying directories with a single binary. This makes it possible for Listaller to install software for non-root users into their home directory, although this method has to be enabled explicitly and its use is not encouraged. The Listaller Developer Tools provide tools and documentation for application developers to make their software relocatable. Listaller and Autopackage In August 2010 both projects announced they will merge.Launchpad.net announcement: Listaller and Autopackage will merge As consequence of the merge, Autopackage abandoned its own package binary package format and all user interfaces to install Autopackage packages. Autopackage tools like BinReloc to create relocatable applications or APBuild are now developed as part of the Listaller project. Reason for merging Autopackage into Listaller was mainly a great lack of developers in both projects so they decided to join forces. Integration KDE provides support for Listaller through Apper, although distributors need to explicitly enable it using a compile-time switch. Support for GNOME is currently being developed as part of the GNOME-PackageKit suite. In theory, any distribution which can run PackageKit >= 0.8.6 should be able to provide Listaller support too. Ubuntu announced that they will not use Listaller as 3rd-party installer for their Ubuntu Phone, but develop an own, Ubuntu-specific solution instead.Ubuntu dev proposes new package format for mobile apps See also * AppStream References External links * Archive formats Free package management systems Free software programmed in Vala ","title":"Listaller"},{"id":"31202259","text":"In mathematics, and especially differential geometry, an affine sphere is a hypersurface for which the affine normals all intersect in a single point.

Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 Design and development T. Claude Ryan had a long and illustrious career as an aerospace engineer, starting many storied companies, including Ryan Aeronautical Corporation and the Ryan Aeronautical Company. Late in his career, in 1969 he sold Ryan Aeronautical to Teledyne and it became Teledyne-Ryan, with Ryan remaining as chairman emeritus. He started yet another company Ryson Aviation with his son, Jerome Ryan and designed a new aircraft designated the ST-100 and named the Cloudster in honour of the Douglas Cloudster that he had purchased in 1925 and renamed the Ryan Cloudster at that time. Ladislao Pazmany is credited with contributions to the aircraft's design, as well. The ST-100 was intended to be first and foremost a motor glider and second a light aircraft to be flown cross country under power. The aircraft is made with all- metal construction and features a wingspan. The wing has flaps with a range of -12 to +60¬∞ and a flap-aileron interconnect. The landing gear is conventional and features wheel pants. Power is supplied by a Continental O-200-A mounted in tractor configuration. The ST-100 has two batteries to ensure that the engine can be restarted in flight. The prototype, registered N2RY, serial number 001, was completed in 1976. The type was certified on 29 July 1983 under separate type certificates for both FAR Part 23 and Part 26 as a light aircraft and also as a powered glider, for day visual flight rules flight only.

It is the first original release from the developer previously known for support work on games such as Rock Band, BioShock, Mass Effect and more. Shoot Many Robots was released in March 2012 for XBLA and PSN, and a month later for Steam. The Xbox 360 version received mixed reviews‚Äìa Metacritic score of 67‚Äìwhile other versions received too little attention to result in a meaningful rating. An Android port was released in 2013 on the Play Store. An iOS version was announced in 2013, but as of 2019 has not shipped. Gameplay Shoot Many Robots is an action platformer game. Players start in the character's RV, where they may equip their character with five items: one weapon that has unlimited ammunition in the game, a special weapon with limited ammo, and hats, pants, and backpacks that can boost performance statistics such as damage given/health or impart special abilities such as slide attacks or a jetpack. They then select a stage to complete, generally following stages in a linear order, but players can return to a previously completed stage. There are two types of stages. The most common requires the players to make their way through a level from start to finish, often ending on a final boss or a large rush of robots. Checkpoints are laid out through the course, so that if all players die, they will respawn at the last checkpoint passed. The other type of stage is a survival one, where players attempt to withstand several rounds of increasingly difficult enemies; as long as the player makes it through the first wave, they will have succeeded, but gain better rewards for lasting through bonus stages. Players fight off robots by using their weapons, a melee attack, or any special attacks granted by their load-out. The robots have various offensive and defensive mechanisms that the players must work around. Some will fire special slow-moving but powerful bullets that can only be stopped by melee attacking them back to the robot that fired them. Other robots are nearly impervious to attacks from one side, but are vulnerable to attacks from the opposite side. The player has a health meter that will drain when they are hit. If they take too much damage they will collapse; in multiplayer games, another player can revive them, otherwise they will start back at the last checkpoint. The player begins a level with a number of bottles of beer that can be taken to restore health. Robots will drop nuts after dying; this is the game's currency which can be used to buy new equipment. Sometimes robots or special boxes will drop crates that contain tickets with which to purchase new equipment, or a large quantity of nuts. These rewards are tied to a player and can only be picked up by that player. Additionally, power-ups may be dropped by the robots, some giving temporary boosts like extra speed or attack damage, while others restore beer or special ammo. Killing each robot also boosts the player's experience level, which affects what equipment the player will have access to. After completing a level, the players are rated on a star-based scoring system based on the number of nuts collected. To boost their score, players can chain robot kills together to increase a scoring multiplier up to 5x, though players must continue to kill robots to maintain this. The total cumulative stars that a player has earned will influence which levels the player has access too. Players are rewarded with additional nuts based on their relative performance. Once back in the RV, the players can then proceed to use the nuts to purchase equipment that they have obtained a ticket for and within their experience level. The game supports co-operative play between two and four players. Individual player characters are identified by unique colors to distinguish them from others.

The repeated Wahhabi incursions from Najd into southern parts of his territory were the most serious threat to emir Abdullah's position in Transjordan.Salibi, Kamal S. The modern history of Jordan. p. 104 The emir was powerless to repel those raids by himself, thus the British maintained a military base, with a small air force, at Marka, close to Amman. The British military force was the primary obstacle against the Ikhwan, helping emir Abdullah to secure his rule over Transjordan. Background With the defeat of the Hashemites in the Nejd-Hejaz War of 1919, and a failure to establish a Hashemite domain over greater Syria, the British hoped to secure Transjordan and Iraq as Hashemite Kingdoms, and did put a significant effort to secure them from external and internal threats. The military assistance of the British to emir Abdullah of Transjordan was used to help with the suppression of local rebellions at Kura and later by Sultan Adwan, in 1921 and 1923 respectively. They also played a crucial role in the major invasions by the Wahhabi tribesmen of Nejd (the Ikhwan). While Transjordan experienced internal stability during 1922-1923, a new external threat emerged from the south east of the country. The Wahhabi Ikhwan movement, King Ibn Saud's tool of territorial expansion, advanced northwards and westwards, and arrived at the undemarcated borders of Transjordan in summer 1922. The Ikhwan were a cross- tribal striking force, whose religious fervour combined with the support of the King was too strong a military challenge for the Arabian tribes. The Wahabi threat brought forward a merger of interests between the nomadic tribes within Transjordan and the Transjordanian government, and for the first time since its establishment the latter was in a more balanced position vis-√†-vis these tribes. First major raid The Ikhwan initiated their first attack on Transjordan by massacring two villages 12 miles south of Amman belonging to the tribe of Bani Sakhr. In a two-day battle, the tribesmen of Bani Sakhr assisted by the Hadid tribe managed to defeat the raiders. The raiders were intercepted by British armored cars and planes only after they had begun to withdraw.Peter W. Wilson, Douglas Graham. Saudi Arabia: the coming storm . M.E.Sharpe, 1994: p.143 Second major raid In August 1924, a larger Ikhwan militia force, numbering some 4,500 raiders,Noel Joseph Guckian. British Relations with Trans-Jordan, 1920‚Äì1930.

The Ikhwan army suffered heavy casualties, with death toll reaching 500. The raided villages suffered 130 dead. Aftermath Other raids of Ikhwan occurred during the 1927‚Äì1930 Ikhwan Revolt against the authority of Ibn Saud. The Ikhwanis raided on southern Iraq in November 1927, and on Kuwait in January 1928, in which they looted camels and sheep. On both occasions, though they raided brutally, they suffered heavy retaliations from RAF and Kuwaitis.Peter W. Wilson, Douglas Graham. Saudi Arabia: the coming storm .

Some may have gained liberty when the English attacked Jamaica and took it in 1655, and subsequently. Cudjoe was the leader of a community of runaway slaves known as Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town). For nearly a century, until the 1739 and 1740 peace treaties with the British rulers of the island, the Maroons victoriously resisted conquest. Origins of Cudjoe Western slaves ran away into the Cockpit Country and established the first community of Leeward Maroons in the mountainous interior of the island. The runaway slaves were called Maroons, after the Spanish word cimarron.Sivapragasam, After the Treaties (2018), p. 3. The Leeward Maroons most likely emerged in 1690 when there was a Coromantee rebellion on Sutton's estate in western Jamaica, and most of these slaves ran away to form the Leeward Maroons.Edward Long papers, British Library, Add MS 12431, folio 71. Cudjoe is probably the son of one of the leaders of this revolt.Hart, Richard, Slaves who Abolished Slavery (Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press, 2002), p. 43. Milton McFarlane explains that his family's Accompong Town Maroon oral history states that Cudjoe was the freeborn son of Naquan, who was the leader of the rebels who fled from Sutton's estate.Milton McFarlane, Cudjoe the Maroon (London: Allison & Busby, 1977), p. 24. According to contemporary white planters, Cudjoe challenged a Madagascan escaped slave for the leadership of the Leeward Maroons in 1720, and when he defeated and killed his challenger, Cudjoe became the undisputed leader of these western Maroons.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 45‚Äì46. The two main Maroon groups in the 18th century were the Leeward and the Windward Maroons, the former led by Cudjoe in Trelawny Town and the latter led by Queen Nanny and Quao.Bev Carey, The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490‚Äì1880 (Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, 1997) Description R. C. Dallas, who wrote his account half a century after Cudjoe lived, claimed the Maroon leader was described short and stout, with a \\"wildness in his manners\\". He also described Cudjoe as having \\"a very large lump of flesh upon his back, which was partly covered by the tattered remains of an old blue coat, of which the skirts and the sleeves below the elbow were wanting.\\"Dallas, Robert Charles, The History of the Maroons, From Their Origin To The Establishment Of Their Chief Tribe at Sierra Leone (London: A.

Treaty with the British During the First Maroon War of the 1730s, the English colonial forces failed to secure any significant victories against Cudjoe's Leeward Maroons. In 1739, Cudjoe reached an agreement with the British that recognized the Leeward Maroons as an independent nation. The Maroons also received a large tract of land and would not have to pay any taxes on it. However, Cudjoe, in return for this recognition of autonomy, promised to return runaway slaves and help put down future slave rebellions. In the 1740s, some Leeward Maroons who opposed the 1739 treaty rose in revolt, but Cudjoe crushed those rebellions.Orlando Patterson, ‚ÄòSlavery and Slave Revolts: A Sociohistorical Analysis of the First Maroon War, 1665-1740‚Äô, Maroon Societies: Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas, ed. by Richard Price (London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996), p. 273. According to one story, Cudjoe died at Nanny Town in the Blue Mountains five years after peace was concluded.\\"Origins of the Jamaican Maroons\\". The National Library of Jamaica. However, white Jamaican writers Edward Long and Thomas Thistlewood wrote of personal encounters with Cudjoe in the 1750s and 1760s. In the last written reference, Long described how Cudjoe led his Leeward Maroons in a martial performance at Montego Bay for Governor Sir William Lyttleton in 1764. That same year, Thistlewood reported receiving news that \\"Colonel Cudjoe is dead some time ago\\". Legacy The treaty of 1739 named Accompong as Cudjoe's successor, and Accompong tried to take control of Trelawny Town when Cudjoe died in 1764. However, the governor, Roger Hope Elletson, asserted his new authority over the Leeward Maroons. Elletson instructed Superintendent John James to take the Trelawny Town badge of authority away from Accompong, and to give it to a Trelawny Town Maroon officer named Lewis. James instructed Accompong that he was to only have authority over Accompong Town.Sivapragasam, After the Treaties (2018), pp. 62‚Äì3.

This includes botany, zoology and geology as well as natural history collections, exploration, art and bibliography. Everyone with an interest in these subjects ‚Äì professional or amateur ‚Äì is welcome to join. The Society's Patron is Sir David Attenborough OM CH FRS. Originally named the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History, SHNH was founded in 1936 by a small group of distinguished scientists, librarians and bibliographers whose appreciation and love of books inspired the formation of the Society in London. The Society's first President was Charles Davies Sherborn (1861‚Äì1942), who compiled the Index Animalium single-handedly over 43 years (1758‚Äì1850). This 11 volume, 9,000 page work became the basis for zoological nomenclature. The Society's main publication is Archives of Natural History which is published for the Society by Edinburgh University Press. Archives of Natural History provides an avenue for the publication of papers on the history and bibliography of natural history in its broadest sense, and in all periods and all cultures. This includes botany, geology, palaeontology and zoology, the lives of naturalists, their publications, correspondence and collections, and the institutions and societies to which they belong. Bibliographical papers concerned with the study of rare books, manuscripts and illustrative material, and analytical and enumerative bibliographies are also published. From time to time, the Society also publishes other works of interest, the most recent being Darwin in the Archives. An informal Newsletter is also produced. The Society holds a regular series of meetings on all aspects of the history of natural history. These range from short evening meetings to international conferences taking place over several days with associated visits. It holds an annual \\"Spring Meeting\\" incorporating the Annual General Meeting at which Officers of the Society are elected, accounts presented, and medals and awards are announced. Every alternate year this becomes an international conference usually in the form of a one- or two-day symposium on a selected theme. Its meetings are seen as an important contribution to forging links between all those working in the history of natural history, leading to lasting collaborations and friendships across national and international boundaries. The Society is a registered charity under English law. Medals and prizes The Society seeks to promote the objectives for which it was founded by making awards for excellence in areas of its fields of activity. The following medals and prizes are awarded by the Society for the History of Natural History: * The Founders' Medal is awarded to persons who have made a substantial contribution to the study of the history or bibliography of natural history. More than one medal can be awarded in any given year. * The John Thackray Medal was instituted in 2000 to commemorate the life and work of John Thackray, Past President of the Society. This medal is awarded for a significant achievement in the preceding three years in the history of those areas of interest to the Society, that is the biological and earth sciences in the broadest sense. Recognition may be for a piece of work completed (e.g. the cataloguing of an archive collection), a publication (book or journal article), exhibition etc. Recipients may be individuals, teams or institutions. * The Patron's Prize was instituted in 2011, whereby an outstanding young scholar, nominated by Council, is invited by the Society‚Äôs Patron to write a review that advances the Society's objects, namely ‚Äúthe historical and bibliographical study of the growth of all branches of natural history in all periods and cultures‚Äù. The current patron of SHNH is Sir David Attenborough OM CH FRS. * The William T. Stearn Student Essay Prize was instituted in 2007 to commemorate the work of late William T. Stearn, a scholar whose work contributed much to the field of botany and to the Society. The prize is awarded to the best original, unpublished essay in the history of natural history. The competition is open to undergraduate and postgraduate students in full- or part-time education. Presidents * Arthur MacGregor 2015‚Äìpresent * Hugh Torrens 2012‚Äì2015 * P.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The house was individually listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1993.  Henry Lischer The home is associated with Henry Lischer, the owner and publisher of one of Davenport's German-language newspapers, Der Demokrat. The paper was founded by Theodor G√ºlich in November 1851. Lischer and his partner, Theodor Olshausen, bought the paper in 1856. Both were German immigrants who became newspapermen in St. Louis, Missouri.Svendsen, 8-1 At its inception the paper was aligned with the political philosophy, and financial support, of the Democratic Party. However, it was a ‚Äúfree paper‚Äù that was not beholden to party doctrines and supported the right of freedom and human rights. It began to support the positions of the Republican Party. It was opposed to slavery and printed a supportive obituary to abolitionist John Brown. Lischer and Olshausen left Davenport in 1860 to return to St. Louis where they took over the Westliche Post. The new owners of Der Demokrat experienced financial problems as a result of their radical views and the economic downturn as a result of the American Civil War. Lischer, who still had a financial interest in the paper, returned to Davenport and became its sole owner for the next 40 years. After the Civil War, editorials in the paper fought the prohibition of alcohol, which was supported by the Republican Party. Even after the state of Iowa successfully passed prohibition laws in 1882, Scott County remained defiant with the support of the paper. Lischer's sons continued their father's work after his death. House The Italian Villa style house was designed by Davenport architect W.L. Carroll. Contracts for construction were let in 1868 to Frank Kurk as the contractor and Frank Noe for the brickwork. It sits high on a bluff above the street. In 1874 Lischer and his son-in-law and next door neighbor Frederick G. Clausen built the stone wall and the staircases that led from the sidewalk to their respective residences.

Their names mean respectively Me and You in the Irish language. Six months into her journey, Tusa was found to be suffering from anaemia and had to be put down. Marianne considered admitting defeat; however despite numerous other hardships she persevered and completed the journey, joining in the St Patrick‚Äôs Day parade through the streets of New York in 2004.

Based on the 1948 novel Conspirator by Humphrey Slater, the film is about a beautiful 18-year-old American woman who meets and falls in love with one of a British Guards, an officer who turns out to be a spy for the Soviet Union. After they are married, she discovers his true identity and forces him to choose between his marriage and his ideology. When his Soviet handlers order him to murder his young American wife, he is faced with the ultimate choice. The film was made for distribution by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film created some controversy over the age difference between Robert Taylor, who was in his late 30s, and Elizabeth Taylor, who was only 16 at the time of production. The producers were careful to cut mentions in the film of the British traitors during the Second World War, such as John Amery and Norman Baillie-Stewart, out of fear of litigation by their families.Walker 1991, p.78‚Äì79. An indirect mention of Baillie-Stewart remained in the film, however, with him being referred to not by name but simply as \\"that fellow in the Tower\\". The plot of the film also bore some similarities to the later case of the Cambridge Spies, including Donald MacLean.

Allgov.com, retrieved March 16, 2011 i.e. its principal executive officer and official spokesperson. The chairman is responsible for long-range planning as well as budgetary and certain personnel functions of the NRC. ‚ÄúHe also has authority for all NRC functions pertaining to a potential emergency involving an NRC licensee‚Äù.  Policy positions  Jaczko has asserted that the greatest possible openness furthers the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's work on the protection of the environment and of public health and safety. He encourages ‚Äúlicensees, vendors, state and local governments, interest groups, and the general public‚Äù to participate in the commission's policy-making efforts. Efforts by Jaczko to strengthen security regulations for nuclear power plants have included requiring new such plants to be able to withstand an aircraft crash. On February 9, 2012, Jaczko cast the lone dissenting vote on plans to build the first new nuclear power plant in more than 30 years when the NRC voted 4‚Äì1 to allow Atlanta-based Southern Co to build and operate two new nuclear power reactors at its existing Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia. He cited safety concerns stemming from Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, saying \\"I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened\\".  Management style and resignation  A report by Nuclear Regulatory Commission Inspector General Hubert T. Bell accused Jaczko of \\"strategically\\" withholding information from his colleagues in an effort to keep plans for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository from advancing. In October 2011, all the other four NRC commissioners‚Äîtwo Democrats and two Republicans‚Äîsent a letter to the White House expressing \\"grave concern\\" about Jaczko's actions at the NRC. On December 14, 2011, Commissioner William Ostendorff, a Republican, told a House oversight committee that Jaczko's \\"bullying and intimidation... should not and cannot be tolerated.\\" At a House Government Reform and Oversight Committee hearing on December 14, 2011, NRC Commissioner William Magwood, a fellow Democrat, testified about what he called Jaczko's abusive behavior towards employees, especially female subordinates. ‚ÄúOne woman told me that she felt the chairman was actually irritated with someone else, but took it out on her,‚Äù Magwood said. ‚ÄúAnother said she was angry at herself for being brought to tears in front of male colleagues. A third described how she couldn‚Äôt stop shaking after her experience. She sat, talking with her supervisor until she could calm down sufficiently to drive home.‚Äù A report by the majority Republicans on the Government Reform and Oversight Committee detailed incidents indicating what House Republicans called Jaczko's \\"propensity for angry outbursts and aggressive behavior.\\" A 2012 NRC Office of Inspector General report cleared him of such allegations. Top House Republicans called on President Obama to dismiss Jaczko. Jaczko said problems at the agency were not his fault but instead stem from \\"lack of understanding\\" on the part of others. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid defended Jaczko, saying his critics are attacking him because \\"they‚Äôre concerned about the nuclear industry. He‚Äôs concerned about the American people.\\"\\"NRC Chief‚Äôs Temper Undermining Agency, House Republicans Say\\", Bloomberg, 14 December 2011 Peter A. Bradford, who was a commission member from 1977 to 1982, has also defended Jaczko. Bradford said it was not unusual for the commissioners to disagree strongly, and added that he did not believe that \\"the chairman is somehow raging around the agency and intimidating the staff\\". He also argued that, although the letter about Jaczko was written by two Republicans and two Democrats, it was necessarily bi- partisan in the context of nuclear politics. He claimed that \\"In Washington, you‚Äôve got a situation where the ‚Äònuclear party‚Äô transcends the Republican and Democratic party,\\" adding that \\"You‚Äôve got four members of the nuclear party writing a letter about the chairman, who‚Äôs never been a member of the nuclear party.\\" Jaczko resigned in May 2012.\\"Chairman of N.R.C. to Resign Under Fire\\", New York Times, 22 May 2012 He was succeeded by Allison Macfarlane.

Wheeler was active in Republican Party politics. Biography Wheeler was born in Oakland, California, on December 12, 1863. His parents were Charles C. Wheeler from Norridgewock, Maine, and the former Angelina (or Angeline) Stetson from Kingston, Massachusetts. The parents were married in the gold rush town of Columbia, California, on April 17, 1859. As reprinted in The Mayflower Descendant in January 1987, volume 37, number 1. Wheeler was raised in Oakland and attended public schools. In 1879 while he was in high school, his sister Gertrude Wheeler was born; she later married John W. Beckman and became a singing teacher, phonologist and inventor. Wheeler was raised alongside a brother who never sought higher education. In 1884, Wheeler graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of California, and began working in Oakland in the law office of John Henry Boalt. Concurrently, he studied advanced law at Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco and graduated in 1886, the same year he advanced to the bar. As an attorney, Wheeler took up residence in San Francisco and continued with the law firm Garber, Boalt and Bishop. In 1892, Wheeler was made partner. After the deaths of Boalt and Judge John R. Garber, the firm was reconstituted as Bishop, Wheeler and Hoefler. In 1904, Wheeler headed his own firm, with no partners. In 1912 he took on a partner: attorney John F. Bowie, some fifteen years younger. By 1918, Wheeler worked occasionally with his son, Charles S. Wheeler Jr, as co-counsel. Wheeler's clients included the First National Bank, the Bank of British North America, the Barron Estate Co., and the First Federal Trust Co. of San Francisco. He specialized in probate law, mining claims, corporate law and real estate law; the office was on 14 Montgomery Street. From 1920 to 1923, Wheeler partnered with his son. Wheeler was attorney to Phoebe Apperson Hearst, and to Elizabeth Boalt after the death of her husband, Wheeler's mentor John H. Boalt. Wheeler advised the two women in their gifts to the University of California School of Law, instituting the Hearst architectural plan including Hearst Memorial Mining Building and Boalt Hall of Law. When the plans were celebrated in early 1906, Wheeler announced a gift of $250,000 that he would use to endow a law professorship. When Wheeler died on April 27, 1923, a number of memorial motions were made in various courts. These motions were combined into the 1924 book Memorial motions in court upon the death of Charles Stetson Wheeler. One of them was as follows: \\"Mr. Wheeler was a man, in every sense of the word. A stranger coming within our gates meeting him on the street and observing him, his wonderful physique, his wonderful bearing, at once would exclaim, 'What man is this? Society and politics In college, Wheeler joined the fraternity Beta Theta Pi and was later given honorary membership in Phi Delta Phi. He joined the San Francisco Art Association, the Bohemian Club, the Pacific-Union Club, the Olympic Club, and the Commonwealth Club, among others. Wheeler served as a Regent of the University of California from 1892 to 1896, from 1902 to 1907, and again from 1911 to 1923. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Wheeler served on the Committee of Fifty, a group of prominent citizens who quickly took control of reconstruction when it became clear the San Francisco Board of Supervisors was unable. Wheeler held the position of secretary of the Relief Committee. In December 1908, he reported that the Relief Committee, because of its success in carrying out its mission, would be dissolved at the first of the year. He noted that $9.5 million had been distributed to those in need, and that the committee's administration costs had been 2% of that. The relief work had provided approximately 8,000 homes for 30,000 people. Prior to the 1912 United States presidential election, Wheeler publicly debated the former California governor James N. Gillett on the question of which Republican nominee deserved the backing of his party, to be decided at the primary elections. Wheeler spoke for Theodore Roosevelt while Gillett argued for incumbent William Howard Taft. Wheeler said Taft was \\"blind to the signs of the times\\", the candidate of \\"men satisfied with the old political methods.\\" In the event, Taft won the primary but Roosevelt ran anyway as a third party candidate, splitting the Republican vote to allow Woodrow Wilson to gain the presidency. In 1920, Wheeler traveled to Chicago to serve as alternate delegate for California at the Republican National Convention. The California delegation put Wheeler on the podium to give a rousing speech for the nomination of California-born candidate Hiram Johnson who had been Roosevelt's running mate in 1912. Personal life Wheeler married fine artist Lillian Marsh, a few months his senior. She studied art with William Keith in San Francisco in the 1890s. She lived in that city all her life. After her husband's death, she took up residence at the Fairmont Hotel. She died in 1952. Wheeler's offspring include son Charles Stetson Wheeler Jr., and daughters Elizabeth, Jean, Lilias and Olive B.; all spending summers together with their parents in remote Northern California as reported in 1910. A grandson, outdoorsman Charles (\\"Charley\\") Stetson Wheeler III, married Kathryn (\\"Katie\\") Anita Lillard (1920-2003) of the Irvine family of Southern California. Charley headed cattle operations for the Irvine Company from 1953 to 1977, then became the company's corporate secretary until his death in 1993. Katie joined the board of the James Irvine Foundation in 1950, guiding its decisions in making grants for the next half century until her death in 2003. A branch of the Orange County Public Libraries system in Irvine was built to memorialize her: The Katie Wheeler Branch Library. =Wheeler Ranch= The Bend, 1899, designed by Willis Polk In 1899 from innkeeper Lydia Sisson, the widow of landowner and outdoorsman Justin Sisson, Wheeler bought extensive land called \\"The Bend\\" in Siskiyou County, in the Cascade Range south by southeast of Mount Shasta on the McCloud River. He called this holding the Wheeler Ranch, and he built a hunting lodge on the river at Horseshoe Bend‚Äîits cornerstone laid in 1899. The lodge was designed by San Francisco architect Willis Polk, and included an 800-book library with room for hundreds of Native American baskets. Wheeler directed Polk to give the lodge a \\"fish tower\\"‚Äîa high study with a view, and two windows which were aquariums containing local trout. A Latin inscription over the entrance indicated this room was a temple to fishing: piscatoribus sacrum. The Wheeler family stayed at the ranch many a summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst asked if she could purchase the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark who called it Wyntoon. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to her new lease and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story house to be built, one designed by Bernard Maybeck in the Gothic style of a Rhine River castle. Wheeler was \\"privately furious\\" with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. She built other structures including a cottage for overflow guests, another \\"honeymoon cottage\\", and a separate building housing the kitchen facilities. The castle was finished in 1904. Wheeler retained the part of Wheeler Ranch that was not leased to Hearst, including the hunting lodge.

In November 1987, along with other Turkish organizations of western Thrace, the Turkish Union of Xanthi was banned because according to the court the word \\"Turkish\\" in their titles as a description for members of the Muslim minority of Greece endangered public order and it should be used only to refer to Turkish citizens.

Based on a forelimb, it was described in 2011 by Oct√°vio Mateus and colleagues. The only species is Angolatitan adamastor. Angolatitan was a relict form of its time, being a basal titanosauriform sauropod in the Late Cretaceous, when more derived titanosaurs were far more common. Discovery and naming After the Angolan Civil War ended in 2002, the PaleoAngola project planned the first Angolan palaeontological expeditions since the 1960s. The first of these expeditions started in 2005 to explore Angola's fossil rich upper Cretaceous rocks, leading to the discovery of Angolatitan. The discovery was made by Oct√°vio Mateus on May the 25 near Iembe in the province of Bengo, and excavations were conducted during may and August 2006. Angolatitan adamastor was described by Oct√°vio Mateus and colleagues in 2011. The generic name means \\"Angolan giant\\". Adamastor is a mythological sea monster that represented the dangers Portuguese sailors faced in the southern Atlantic. Until 1975, Angola was a Portuguese colony. Description The only specimen is a partial right forelimb, including shoulder blade, upper arm bone, the two bones of the lower arm (ulna and radius), and three metacarpals. These fossils (Field number MGUAN-PA-003) are stored in the Museu de Geologia of the Universidade Agostinho Neto in Luanda. The upper arm bone measures , the ulna in length. In general, the forelimb was less robust than in most of the more derived titanosaurs. The metacarpals were slender and equal in length; those of titanosaurs were more robust with varying lengths. Unlike titanosaurs, the olecranon was absent, and the first metacarpal was not bowed. Classification Angolatitan was a basal titanosauriform, more derived than Brachiosaurus but less derived than Euhelopus and Titanosauria, which is notable given its relatively late appearance in the sauropod fossil record. Recent phylogenetic tests run by Gorsack and O'Conner (2017) recover Angolatitan as a non-titanosaurian titanosauriform. Palaeoecology The specimen was found in a 50 m thick subsection of the Itombe Formation, called the Tadi Beds. Itombe formation was considered Turonian in age, but new data suggests to be Coniacian. These rocks were deposited under marginary marine conditions; fossils include ammonites, echinoderms, and fishes (including sharks). Tetrapods include the turtle Angolachelys mbaxi, the Mosasaurs Angolasaurus bocagei and Tylosaurus iembeensis as well as several plesiosaur fossils. Angolatitans habitat would have been desert-like. Presumably, this sauropod would have been well adapted to very dry conditions as it is the case with today's desert elephants.

Plot Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) (iCarly) is dating a boy named Steven Carson (Cameron Deane Stewart), who divides his time between his divorced parents in Seattle and Los Angeles. Every other month, Steven goes off to Los Angeles, where he is also dating Tori Vega (Victoria Justice) (Victorious), who attends Hollywood Arts, a high school for the performing arts. Robbie Shapiro (Matt Bennett), a socially awkward friend of Tori's, posts a picture of Steven and Tori online, which Carly and her friend Sam Puckett (Jennette McCurdy) stumble upon. Carly denies that Steven is cheating on her, but Sam seeks to prove otherwise. Carly, her brother Spencer (Jerry Trainor), Sam, and their friends Freddie Benson (Nathan Kress) and Gibby Gibson (Noah Munck) travel to Los Angeles. They visit Spencer's ex- girlfriend, Monie (Jen Lilley), who happens to be a skilled make-up artist, and receive disguise makeovers to avoid being noticed from iCarly by others. They then head off to Kenan Thompson's house, where Andre Harris (Leon Thomas III), another friend of Tori's, is hosting a party that they suspect Steven and Tori are attending; Rex, Robbie's ventriloquist dummy, has tweeted about the party, resulting in hundreds of people attending, much to the dismay of Andre, who had only wanted a small party. The iCarly gang enter Kenan's house during the party and split up to search for Steven. Spencer discovers that the house includes a jacuzzi and relaxes in it, leading to him meeting Tori's teacher Sikowitz (Eric Lange) and her friends Beck Oliver (Avan Jogia) and Jade West (Elizabeth Gillies). Sinjin Van Cleef (Michael Eric Reid), another student at Hollywood Arts, falls into the jacuzzi when a surfing machine malfunctions. Meanwhile, Carly catches Steven and watches him kiss Tori, after which she admits that Sam was correct about Steven cheating on her. The iCarly members remove their disguises, and Tori walks in and immediately recognizes them from iCarly. Carly and her friends explain the situation to Tori, and together they come up with a plan to humiliate Steven. They lure Steven into a closet where he thinks he will make out with Tori. Instead, when Steven enters the closet, he finds himself on an iCarly webcast with Carly, Sam, Kenan, and Tori, who reveal to iCarlys one million audience members that Steven has been dating Carly and Tori at the same time. Steven becomes embarrassed and leaves. Some time later, Sam defeats Rex in a rap battle. The iCarly gang then join Tori and her friends in karaoke, where they sing \\"Leave It All to Shine\\", a mash-up of the iCarly and Victorious theme songs.

Reception \\"iParty with Victorious\\" received mainly positive reviews from critics. Verne Gay of Newsday gave a positive review, suggesting \\"iParty with Victorious\\" may be the biggest event of the Summer 2011 and noting the scene depicting a guy in a panda costume chasing Kenan Thompson was hilarious. Carl Cortez of Assignment X praised the episode but also gave a slightly more critical review. He believes \\"the mechanism for verifying Carly‚Äôs boyfriend is cheating is a bit of a stretch\\". He reacted positively to how the times spent with the characters of iCarly and Victorious are evenly distributed. Overall, he finds the episode to be \\"enjoyable nonetheless\\" and gives it a grade of B‚àí. This crossover aired during the 2011 NBA Finals and 2011 Stanley Cup.

Its only known fossils were found in 1999 on Cajual Island in the rocks of the Alc√¢ntara Formation, which is known for its abundance of fragmentary, isolated fossil specimens. The remains of Oxalaia were described in 2011 by Brazilian palaeontologist Alexander Kellner and colleagues, who assigned the specimens to a new genus containing one species, Oxalaia quilombensis. The species name refers to the Brazilian quilombo settlements. Oxalaia quilombensis is the eighth officially named theropod species from Brazil and the largest carnivorous dinosaur discovered there. It is closely related to the African genus Spinosaurus, and/or may be a junior synonym of this taxon. Although Oxalaia is known only from two partial skull bones, Kellner and colleagues found that its teeth and had a few distinct features not seen in other spinosaurids or theropods, including two replacement teeth in each socket and a very sculptured secondary palate. Oxalaia habitat was tropical, heavily forested, and surrounded by an arid landscape. This environment had a large variety of lifeforms also present in Middle-Cretaceous North Africa, due to the connection of South America and Africa as parts of the supercontinent Gondwana. As a spinosaurid, the traits of Oxalaia skull and dentition indicate a partly piscivorous (fish-eating) lifestyle similar to that of modern crocodilians. Fossil evidence suggests spinosaurids also preyed on other animals such as small dinosaurs and pterosaurs.  Discovery and naming  Map showing the Northeast Region of Brazil, with the discovery sites of three spinosaurine fossil specimens in the Araripe and S√£o Lu√≠s-Graja√∫ Basins marked. From top to bottom: Oxalaia, Irritator, and Angaturama. Oxalaia stems from the Alc√¢ntara Formation, a succession of sedimentary rocks that is part of the Itapecuru Group of the S√£o Lu√≠s-Graja√∫ Basin, in northeastern Brazil. These rocks have been dated by scientists to the Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, 100.5 to 93.9 million years ago. Outcropping at the northern coast of the formation, the Laje do Coringa locality is made up mostly of sandstones and mudstones, along with conglomerate rock layers containing fossil plant and vertebrate fragments. These sediments were deposited under marine and fluvial conditions similar to those of the Bahariya Formation in Egypt, where Spinosaurus remains have been found. In 1999, fossils of Oxalaia were recovered from the Laje do Coringa. Palaeontologist Elaine Machado, of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, was surprised to find such a well-preserved fossil at the site and stated in a press release that \\"this is how most scientific discoveries happen, it was by accident\\". The finding was a rare occurrence due to the erosive nature of the tides at the deposit, which are responsible for the fragmented state of most fossils in the bone bed; remains not found on site are often removed from the formation by wave action. Generally, the majority of fossil remains found at the Alc√¢ntara Formation consist of teeth and isolated skeletal elements, of which the Laje do Coringa site has yielded hundreds. Diagram illustrating known jaw material in place Oxalaia is one of three spinosaurid dinosaurs discovered in Brazil, the other two being Irritator and its possible synonym Angaturama, both of which were also initially known from partial skulls. They were discovered in the Romualdo Formation of the Santana Group, part of the Araripe Basin. Microfossils date this formation to the Albian, around nine to six million years before Oxalaia. The fossil record of spinosaurids is poor compared to those of other theropod groups; very few body fossils are known and most genera have been erected from isolated elements such as vertebra or teeth. The holotype specimen of Oxalaia quilombensis, designated MN 6117-V, was found in situ (at its original place of deposition) with part of the left side embedded in the rock matrix; it consists of the fused premaxillae (frontmost snout bones) from a large individual. An isolated and incomplete left (main upper jaw bone) fragment (MN 6119-V) was referred to Oxalaia because it showed the same general traits occurring in spinosaurids, the maxilla was discovered on the rock surface, having possibly moved from its original location after erosion. Both bone fragments were found on Cajual Island, Maranh√£o, in the Northeast Region of Brazil, and were housed at the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. In 2018, a fire engulfed the palace housing the museum, possibly destroying Oxalaias specimens, along with various other fossils found in Brazil. Besides the partial skull bones, numerous spinosaurid teeth had earlier been reported from the Laje do Coringa site. Two partial caudal (tail) vertebrae from the formation have been referred to the spinosaurid species Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis'. American palaeontologist Mickey Mortimer informally noted that these may instead belong to Oxalaia. The discoveries of Oxalaia and of the Late Cretaceous reptiles Pepesuchus and Brasiliguana were announced in a presentation by the Brazilian Academy of Sciences in March 2011. Machado described Oxalaia as \\"the dominant reptile of [what is now] Cajual Island\\". She stated that there is interest in spinosaurids in Brazil and abroad because of their debut in the Jurassic Park franchise and their distinctiveness among other carnivorous dinosaurs. The species description of Oxalaia was written by Brazilian palaeontologists Alexander Kellner, Elaine Machado, Sergio Azevedo, Deise Henriques, and Luciana Carvalho. This paper, among many others, were composed into a volume of 20 works on prehistoric biodiversity that was published by the Academy in March 2011. The type species Oxalaia quilombensis is the eighth officially named species of theropod from Brazil. The generic name Oxalaia is derived from the name of the African deity Oxal√°, which was introduced into Brazil during the slavery period. The specific name quilombensis refers to the quilombo settlements like those on Cajual Island, which were founded by escaped slaves. Description Tentative size estimate, with the animal in a swimming position The holotype praemaxillae are together approximately long, with a preserved width of (maximal estimated original width is ), and a height of . Based on skeletal material from related spinosaurids, the skull of Oxalaia would have been an estimated long; this is smaller than Spinosaurus skull, which was approximated at long by Italian palaeontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso and colleagues in 2005. Kellner and his team compared the Dal Sasso specimen (MSNM V4047) to Oxalaia original snout in 2011; from this they estimated Oxalaia at in length and in weight, making it the largest known theropod from Brazil, the second largest being Pycnonemosaurus, which was estimated at by one study. The tip of the rostrum (snout) is enlarged and the rear-end constricted, forming the terminal rosette shape that distinguishes spinosaurids; this form would have interlocked with the also-expanded front of the (tooth-bearing bone of the ). The rostrum of Oxalaia features broad, deep (holes) that are possibly nutrient canals for blood vessels and nerves; it is also rounder in side view than that of Spinosaurus, whose upper jaw ends in a more acute downward angle as shown by specimens MSNM V4047 and MNHN SAM 124. The maxillae show a pair of elongated and thin processes extending forwards along the midline of the roof of the mouth; they are encased between the praemaxillae and border an elaborate, triangle-shaped pit at their front end. Similar processes are present in Suchomimus, Cristatusaurus, and MNHN SAM 124, although not as exposed. These structures compose the animal's secondary palate. The undersides of the praemaxillae are greatly ornamented in Oxalaia, in contrast to the smoother condition it has in other spinosaurids. restoration based on relatives The praemaxillae have seven (tooth sockets) on each side, the same number found in Angaturama, Cristatusaurus, Suchomimus, and MNHN SAM 124 (referred to Spinosaurus); MSNM V4047, another upper jaw specimen from Spinosaurus, had only six. It cannot be confirmed whether this lower number of teeth is due to ontogeny; for that, a larger sample size is necessary. A large diastema (gap in tooth row) separates the third tooth socket from the fourth; this is observed in all other spinosaurids, being smaller in Suchomimus. Another diastema of nearly equal length is found between the fifth and sixth alveolus; this diastema is seen in MNHN SAM 124 and is much longer in MSNM V4047 but is absent from Suchomimus and Cristatusaurus. The maxilla fragment referred to Oxalaia (MN 6119-V) has two alveoli and a broken third one that includes a partial tooth. Like the praemaxilla, it had preserved nutrient canals. It also features a shallow dent in the middle, suggesting it was located near the (bony nostrils). Small fragments inside some of the remaining alveoli show that unlike its Early Cretaceous relatives Suchomimus and Cristatusaurus, Oxalaia lacked on its teeth. Apart from the single, functional tooth in each socket, there were two replacement teeth, which according to Kellner are \\"a common feature in sharks or in some reptiles, but not in theropods\\". A cross- section of the teeth showed the typical oval shape exhibited by spinosaurs rather than the lateral compression of other theropod teeth. The spinosaurid teeth reported from Laje do Coringa were classified into two primary morphotypes by Brazilian palaeontologist Manuel Medeiros in 2006. Both show typical spinosaurine dentition, though morphotype II has smoother tooth enamel than the first. Oxalaia teeth display a closer morphology to morphotype I while the second grouping of teeth represent either worn down morphotype I teeth or an undescribed spinosaurine from the Alc√¢ntara Formation.  Classification  Size of various spinosaurids (Oxalaia in green, third from left) compared with a human The type elements of Oxalaia closely resemble those of specimens MSNM V4047 and MNHN SAM 124, both referred to Spinosaurus aegyptiacus. Kellner and colleagues differentiated Oxalaia from it and other spinosaurids by its autapomorphic (distinguishing) craniodental features, like its sculptured palatal part of the premaxillae, and the possession of two replacement teeth in each position. More fragmentary spinosaurids such as Siamosaurus and \\"Sinopliosaurus\\" fusuiensis are based only on teeth, making them difficult to separate from other taxa. The habit of naming theropods from isolated teeth or tooth fragments has resulted in many invalid and synonymous genera; it has also occurred with spinosaurids and is compounded by the common lack of overlapping skeletal remains‚Äîa precondition of validly distinguishing taxa. Labeled skull diagram of the related Spinosaurus In 2017, a phylogenetic analysis by the Brazilian palaeontologists Marcos Sales and Cesar Schultz concluded that Oxalaia was more closely related to African spinosaurines than to Brazilian spinosaurines like Angaturama, as indicated by a wider snout and the lack of a dorsal sagittal crest on the praemaxillae. The Brazilian genera Oxalaia and Angaturama were recovered as the two closest relatives of Spinosaurus, Oxalaia forming its sister taxon. Though fragmentary, the Brazilian material indicates that spinosaurines were more diverse than previously recognized. Spinosaurus differs from Oxalaia by its significantly more widely spaced tooth sockets, the presence of a slight narrowing between its third and fourth sockets, and the sharper slope of its snout. Oxalaia is currently assigned to the subfamily Spinosaurinae due to the morphology of its upper jaw and the absence of fine serrations on its teeth that typify baryonychines. Below is a cladogram by Sales and Schultz, in which Oxalaia is grouped in the Spinosaurinae, as a closer relative to Spinosaurus than Angaturama. In 2020, a paper by Robert Smyth and colleagues assessing spinosaurines from the Kem Kem Group did not find the autapomorphies of Oxalaia quilombensis sufficient enough to warrant a separate taxon, but instead considered them a result of individual variation. The authors thus considered the species a junior synonym of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus. If supported by future studies, this would imply Spinosaurus aegyptiacus had a wider distribution and support a faunal exchange scenario between South America and Africa during the Cenomanian. Palaeoecology Generalised locations of spinosaurid fossil discoveries from the Albian-Cenomanian, 113 to 93.9 million years ago, marked on a map of that time span. The Late Cretaceous deposits of the Alc√¢ntara Formation have been interpreted as a humid habitat of tropical forests dominated by conifers, ferns, and horsetails. These forests were surrounded by an arid-to-semi-arid landscape that was probably subjected to brief periods of heavy rainfall followed by lengthy dry periods. A great abundance and variety of animal taxa, such as dinosaurs, pterosaurs, snakes, molluscs, crocodilians, notosuchids, and fish have been discovered in the formation. Aquatic taxa known from the deposits include the large coelacanth Mawsonia gigas; the ray Myliobatis sp. (of uncertain species); two sclerorhynchid sawfishes; as well as several bony fish, ray-finned fish, and lungfish species. Dinosaur fossil remains suggest the presence of diplodocoids like Itapeuasaurus cajapioensis, basal titanosaurs, the giant theropod Carcharodontosaurus sp., a noasaurid closely related to Masiakasaurus, and a dromaeosaurid. Also, characteristic teeth and a vertebral centra were referred to Spinosaurus sp. Most of the flora and fauna discovered in the Alc√¢ntara Formation was also present in North Africa in the Kem Kem Beds of Morocco during the Cenomanian; with a few exceptions including Oxalaia quilombensis, Atlanticopristis equatorialis, Equinoxiodus alcantariensis, and Coringasuchus anisodontis. According to Medeiros and colleagues, the Laje do Coringa assemblage may also be linked to the contemporaneous Bahariya Formation in Egypt, which holds a distinct combination of key taxa constituting Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, Carcharodontosaurus saharicus, and Onchopristis numidus. This extreme similarity between the Cretaceous biota of Brazil with that of Africa is a result of their connection as parts of the supercontinent Gondwana (which comprised most landmasses of the modern southern hemisphere). This connection was broken by rifting and sea-floor spreading 130‚Äì110 million years ago. Afterwards, the transoceanic assemblages would have continued to evolve separately, contributing to small differences between taxa. Machado stated that Cajual Island was still attached to the African continent during the Cenomanian. Similarly, Medeiros and colleagues noted that the presence of an island chain or other lasting land connection during that time could explain the faunal similarities. An Indian gharial, displaying the same interlocking rosette shape seen in spinosaurid snout tips As a spinosaur, Oxalaia would have had large, robust forelimbs; relatively short hindlimbs; elongated (upwards projections of the vertebrae) forming a ridge or on its back; and tall neural spines on its caudal vertebrae which‚Äîsimilar to the tails of modern crocodilians‚Äîmay have aided in swimming. Spinosaurids likely spent most of their time near or in water and fed mostly on aquatic animals, avoiding direct competition with other large predators but being able to sustain themselves on terrestrial animals if necessary. Such behavior is observed in cases such as juvenile Iguanodontid bones found in the stomach cavity of a Baryonyx fossil and an Irritator tooth embedded in pterosaur remains. The conical, transversely oval-shaped teeth of Oxalaia and its nasal openings, that were retracted further back on the skull than in most theropods (likely to avoid water entering its nostrils while fishing) are characteristic of spinosaurids. Both features are useful adaptations for catching and feeding on fish. The expanded, interlocking front jaws and piercing teeth of spinosaurs worked as an efficient fish trap, a trait also exhibited by the Indian gharial‚Äîthe most piscivorous extant crocodilian. Kellner compared the general appearance of spinosaurid skulls to those of alligators.

It is based on the pickling dry-rub mix used in preparing Montreal smoked meat. The smoked meat seasoning is derived from pickling mixes used in Romanian Jewish cuisine. The primary constituents of Montreal steak seasoning include garlic, coriander, black pepper, cayenne pepper flakes, dill seed, and salt. The spice mix recipe varies slightly among restaurants and manufacturers. History The Montreal deli Schwartz's is credited with the creation of Montreal steak seasoning. It is rumoured that during the 1940s and 1950s, a Schwartz's broilerman by the name of Morris \\"The Shadow\\" Sherman began adding the deli's smoked meat pickling spices to his own rib and liver steaks. Soon the customers began asking for the same. Due to its popularity, it eventually became a norm in Montreal delis and steakhouses, such as the nearby Moishes Steakhouse and the Main Deli Steak House, to season their steaks similarly.

Sixteen people were killed in the attack and 178 were injured. The attack On Wednesday, 30 July 1997 at 1:15 pm, two Palestinian suicide bombers who carried bags laden with explosives and nails detonated their explosive devices 45 meters (150 feet) apart almost simultaneously in a central alley in the popular outdoor market, killing 16 civilians, among them an Arab resident of Eilabun, and injuring 178 people, many of them teenagers and tourists. Thirteen Israelis were killed immediately and three others died later from their injuries. The Mahane Yehuda attack was followed by a triple suicide bombing on the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall in downtown Jerusalem on 4 September, which killed five Israelis and wounded over 190.

It is notable for producing a number of international players and for its role in the Rugby Football Union fight against professionalism. History Lennox was founded in 1883, and as a sporting club played both rugby and cricket. The origins of its name are open to speculation, with Lennox being an area in central Scotland, and also a surname. The club played at Clapham Common and changed at the Clapham Dining Rooms. Within two years the club had a first class fixture list and had moved from Clapham to a ground next to the Greyhound pub in Dulwich Village. At this time they changed their strip from the original dark blue with a badge to black, white and red hooped jerseys. They stayed in Dulwich throughout the rest of the 1880s and early 1890s, although in 1888 they had moved from Dulwich Village to Turney Road where they used the Crown Hotel to change. During their time in Turney Road their cricketing arm, Lennox CC, merged with Aeolian CC, also based on Turney Road, to form Dulwich Cricket Club, which still exists into the twenty-first century. From the 1890s, the home ground of the club was that of the London Athletic Club, situated in the Fulham Road, Chelsea.Philip Christian William Trevor, Rugby union football, p175, Chapman and Hall, 1903 The original grounds were closed after the last athletics meeting on 24 September 1904, \\"and a new and larger track was made, partly on the same site, with a banked track for cycling and seating accommodation for 10,000 people. The new area of seventeen acres was still known as Stamford Bridge, and the L.A.C. opened with a meeting on 10 May 1905. During the winter months the ground is used by the Chelsea Football Club.\\"'Sport, ancient and modern: Athletics', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 2: General; Ashford, East Bedfont with Hatton, Feltham, Hampton with Hampton Wick, Hanworth, Laleham, Littleton (1911), pp. 301‚Äì302.

However, in 1893 they gained more renown through the actions of H.E. Steed. On 20 September 1893, J. A. Miller of the Yorkshire county proposed at a meeting of the Rugby Football Union that players be allowed compensation for bona fide loss of time. This was seconded by his fellow Yorkshireman M. Newsome. The honorary secretary of the RFU, George Rowland Hill, opposed this and he was supported by R Whalley of Lancashire. A vote was cast and won by 282 to 136 votes in favour of declining to sanction the proposal for compensation for bona fide loss of time. Present at the meeting were an enormous amount of representatives from the north of England who had travelled to support the vote for compensation, having used two special trains for the purpose. However, H.E. Steed, of Lennox, described as a remarkable organiser, had already gained the proxies of 120 clubsFrancis Marshall, Leonard R. Tosswill, Football: the Rugby union game, p59, 1925 (Cassell and Co., ltd.,) against what was termed \\"professionalism\\". The club maintained a first class fixture list into the early twentieth century but after their move from Stamford Bridge, they began to decline in favour and they became an almost nomadic side. =Disbandment= Dick Tyson, in London's Oldest Rugby Clubs suggests the club were wound up shortly after the 1910‚Äì11 season.

He is the founder, president and chief scientific officer at Genome International Corporation, a biotechnology, bioinformatics, and information technology firm based in Madison, Wisconsin, which develops computational genomics applications of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) and clinical decision support systems for analyzing patient genome data that aids in diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Dr. Senapathy is known for his contributions in genetics, genomics and clinical genomics, especially in the biology of RNA splicing and the split structure of eukaryotic genes. He developed the Shapiro & Senapathy algorithm (S&S;) for predicting the splice sites, exons and genes of eukaryotes, which has become the primary methodology for discovering disease-causing mutations in splice junctions. The S&S; has been implemented in many gene-finding and mutation detection tools that are used extensively in major clinical and research institutions around the world for uncovering mutations in thousands of patients with numerous diseases, including cancers and inherited disorders. It is increasingly used in the Next Generation Sequencing era, as it is widely realized that >50% of all diseases and adverse drug reactions in humans and other animals possibly occur within the splicing regions of genes. The S&S; algorithm has been cited in ~4,000 publications on finding splicing mutations in thousands of cancer and inherited disorders. Dr. Senapathy offered a new hypothesis on the origin of introns, split genes and splice junctions in eukaryotic genes. As the split structure of genes is central to eukaryotic biology, their origin has been a major question in biology. Dr. Senapathy proposed the \\"split gene theory,\\" which states that the split structure arose due to the origin of split genes from random DNA sequences, and provided tangible evidence from genome sequences of several organisms. He also showed that the splice junctions of eukaryotic genes could have originated from the stop codon ends of the Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in random DNA sequences based on analysis of eukaryotic genomic DNA sequences. Dr. Marshall Nirenberg, the Nobel Laureate who had deciphered codons, communicated the papers to the PNAS. Senapathy has published his other scientific findings in journals including Science', Nucleic Acids Research, PNAS, Journal of Biological Chemistry, and Journal of Molecular Biology, and is the author of several patents in the genomics field.  Biography  Senapathy has a Ph.D. in molecular biology from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. He spent twelve years in genome research for the National Institutes of Health's Laboratory of Molecular and Cell Biology (NIADDK) and the Laboratory of Statistical and Mathematical Methodology in the Division of Computer Research and Technology (DCRT) in Bethesda, Maryland (1980‚Äì87), and the Biotechnology Center and the Department of Genetics of the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1987‚Äì91). Dr. Senapathy founded Genome International in 1992 for developing computational biology research, products and services He was married to Sathyaraj's sister  Notable research contributions  Dr. Senapathy has provided major contributions in RNA splicing biology, impacting the understanding of the structure, function, and origin of the eukaryotic exons, introns, splice junctions, and split genes, and the applications of these findings in human medicine that has positively affected thousands of patients with hundreds of diseases including cancers and inherited disorders. His research is an example of the application of basic molecular biology research findings to human medicine with profound impact, and a variety of basic science and other practical applications in animals and plants. = Origin of split genes from random DNA sequences = The split gene theory answers major questions of why and how the split genes of eukaryotes originated. It states that if coding sequences for biological proteins originated from random primordial genetic sequences, the random occurrence of the 3 stop codons out of 64 codons would limit the open reading frames (ORFs) to a very short length of ~60 bases. Thus, coding sequences for biological proteins with average lengths of ~1,200 bases, and long coding sequences of 6,000 bases, can practically never occur in random sequences. Thus, genes had to occur in pieces in a split form, with short coding sequences (ORFs) that became exons, interrupted by very long random sequences that became introns. When the eukaryotic DNA was tested for ORF length distribution, it exactly matched that from random DNA, with very short ORFs that matched the lengths of exons, and very long introns as predicted, supporting the split gene theory. Thus, introns are relics left over from their random sequence origin, and thus are earmarked to be removed at the primary RNA stage, although incidentally they may have few genetic elements useful to the cell. The Nobel Laureate Dr. Marshall Nirenberg, who deciphered the codons, communicated the paper to the PNAS. New Scientist covered this publication titled \\"A long explanation for introns\\". Noted molecular biologist and biophysicist Dr. Colin Blake from the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics and Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences, University of Oxford, commented on Dr. Senapathy's theory that: \\"Recent work by Dr. Senapathy, when applied to RNA, comprehensively explains the origin of the segregated form of RNA into coding and non-coding regions. It also suggests why a splicing mechanism was developed at the start of primordial evolution. The presence of random sequence was therefore sufficient to create in the primordial ancestor the segregated form of RNA observed in the eukaryotic gene structure.\\" = Origin of RNA splice junction signals from stop codons of ORFs = Dr. Senapathy's research also elucidates the origin of the splice junctions of eukaryotic genes, again the major questions of why and how the splice junction signals originated. Dr. Senapathy predicted that, if the split gene theory was true, the ends of these ORFs that had a stop codon would have become the ends of exons that would occur within introns, and that would define the splice junctions. Senapathy found that almost all splice junctions in eukaryotic genes contained stop codons exactly at the ends of introns, bordering the exons as predicted. In fact, these stop codons were found to form the \\"canonical\\" AG:GT splicing sequence, with the three stop codons occurring as part of the strong consensus signals. Senapathy had observed that mutations in these stop codon bases within splice junctions were the cause of the majority of diseases caused by splicing mutations, emphasizing the importance of stop codons in the splice junctions. Thus, the basic split gene theory led to the hypothesis that the splice junctions originated from the stop codons. Dr. Marshall Nirenberg supported the publication of this paper in the PNAS. New Scientist covered this publication titled \\"Exons, Introns and Evolution\\". = Why exons are short and introns are long = Research based on the split gene theory sheds lights on other basic questions of exons and introns. The exons of eukaryotes are generally short (human exons average ~120 bases, and can be as short as 10 bases) and introns are usually very long (average of ~3,000 bases, and can be several hundred thousands bases long), for example genes RBFOX1, CNTNAP2, PTPRD and DLG2. Dr. Senapathy has provided a plausible answer to these questions, which has remained the only explanation so far. Based on the split gene theory, exons of eukaryotic genes, if they originated from random DNA sequences, have to match the lengths of ORFs from random sequence, and possibly should be around 100 bases (close to the median length of ORFs in random sequence). The genome sequences of living organisms, for example the human, exhibits exactly the same average lengths of 120 bases for exons, and the longest exons of 600 bases (with few exceptions), which is the same length as that of the longest random ORFs. In addition, the introns can be very long, based on the split gene theory, which is found to be true in eukaryotic organisms. = Why genomes are large = This work also explains why the genomes are very large, for example, the human genome with three billion bases, and why only a very small fraction of the human genome (~2%) codes for the proteins and other regulatory elements. If split genes originated from random primordial DNA sequences, it would contain a significant amount of DNA that would be represented by introns. Furthermore, a genome assembled from random DNA containing split genes would also include intergenic random DNA. Thus, the nascent genomes that originated from random DNA sequences had to be large, regardless of the complexity of the organism. The observation that the genomes of several organisms such as that of the onion (~16 billion bases ) and salamander (~32 billion bases ) are much larger than that of the human (~3 billion bases ) but the organisms are no more complex than human provides credence to this split gene theory. Furthermore, the findings that the genomes of several organisms are smaller, although they contain essentially the same number of genes as that of the human, such as those of the C. elegans (genome size ~100 million bases, ~19,000 genes) and Arabidopsis (genome size ~125 million bases, ~25,000 genes), adds support to this theory. The split gene theory predicts that the introns in the split genes in these genomes could be the \\"reduced\\" (or deleted) form compared to the larger genes with long introns, thus leading to reduced genomes. In fact, researchers have recently proposed that these smaller genomes are actually reduced genomes, which adds support to the split gene theory. = Origin of the spliceosomal machinery and the eukaryotic cell nucleus = Dr. Senapathy's research also addresses the origin of the spliceosomal machinery that edits out the introns from the RNA transcripts of genes. If the split genes had originated from random DNA, then the introns would have become an unnecessary but integral part of the eukaryotic genes along with the splice junctions at their ends. The spliceosomal machinery would be required to remove them and to enable the short exons to be linearly spliced together as a contiguously coding mRNA that can be translated into a complete protein. Thus, the split gene theory shows that the whole spliceosomal machinery originated due to the origin of split genes from random DNA sequences, and to remove the unnecessary introns. Dr. Senapathy had also proposed a plausible mechanistic and functional rationale why the eukaryotic nucleus originated, a major unanswered question in biology. If the transcripts of the split genes and the spliced mRNAs were present in a cell without a nucleus, the ribosomes would try to bind to both the un-spliced primary RNA transcript and the spliced mRNA, which would result in a molecular chaos. If a boundary had originated to separate the RNA splicing process from the mRNA translation, it can avoid this problem of molecular chaos. This is exactly what is found in eukaryotic cells, where the splicing of the primary RNA transcript occurs within the nucleus, and the spliced mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes translate them into proteins. The nuclear boundary provides a clear separation of the primary RNA splicing and the mRNA translation. = Origin of the eukaryotic cell = These investigations thus led to the possibility that primordial DNA with essentially random sequence gave rise to the complex structure of the split genes with exons, introns and splice junctions. They also predict that the cells that harbored these split genes had to be complex with a nuclear cytoplasmic boundary, and must have had a spliceosomal machinery. Thus, it was possible that the earliest cell was complex and eukaryotic. Surprisingly, findings from extensive comparative genomics research from several organisms over the past 15 years are showing overwhelmingly that the earliest organisms could have been highly complex and eukaryotic, and could have contained complex proteins, exactly as predicted by Senapathy's theory. The spliceosome is a highly complex machinery within the eukaryotic cell, containing ~200 proteins and several SnRNPs. In their paper \\"Complex spliceosomal organization ancestral to extant eukaryotes,\\" molecular biologists Dr. Lesley Collins and Dr. David Penny state \\"We begin with the hypothesis that ... the spliceosome has increased in complexity throughout eukaryotic evolution. However, examination of the distribution of spliceosomal components indicates that not only was a spliceosome present in the eukaryotic ancestor but it also contained most of the key components found in today's eukaryotes. ... the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes appears to show much of the molecular complexity seen today.\\" This suggests that the earliest eukaryotic organisms were highly complex and contained sophisticated genes and proteins, as the split gene theory predicts. = The Shapiro-Senapathy algorithm = The split gene theory culminated in the Shapiro-Senapathy algorithm, which aids in the identification of splicing mutations that cause numerous diseases and adverse drug reactions. This algorithm is increasingly used in clinical practice and research not only to find mutations in known disease-causing genes in patients, but also to discover novel genes that are causal of different diseases. In addition, it is employed in finding the mechanism of aberrant splicing in individual patients as well as cohorts of patients with a particular disease. Furthermore, it is used in defining the cryptic splice sites and deducing the mechanisms by which mutations in them can affect normal splicing and lead to different diseases. It is also employed in addressing various questions in basic research in humans, animals and plants. These contributions have impacted major questions in eukaryotic biology and their applications to human medicine. These applications may expand as the fields of clinical genomics and pharmacogenomics magnify their research with mega sequencing projects such as the All of Us project that will sequence a million individuals, and with the sequencing of millions of patients in clinical practice and research in the future.

A right-arm fast bowler, he took 366 wickets during his 13-year career, at an average of 27.21. Shipman was a lower-order batsman and scored a total of 2,474 runs, with an average score of 14.30. Shipman played 110 of his 111 matches for Leicestershire between 1908 and 1914, but returned to make a single appearance for the county in the summer of 1921. Biography Shipman was born in the village of Ratby, Leicestershire on 1 March 1886. He was one of three brothers who played cricket for Leicestershire; Alan Shipman played almost 400 matches for the county, while Albert Shipman appeared in seven matches for the second XI during the 1914 season. He died in Ratby on 26 August 1943, at the age of 57. Cricket career Shipman began his Leicestershire career in the summer of 1908 and took four wickets on his County Championship debut in the drawn match against Essex in July of that year. Throughout the next five seasons, he was an almost ever-present for the county. Shipman attained personal-best figures of 9‚Äì83 against Surrey in September 1910, and went on to bowl three ten-wicket hauls in his career. His form for Leicestershire earned him appearances in two Test trial matches in the 1911 season; one for The Rest against the England Test side, and one for Gilbert Jessop's XI against a team selected by Plum Warner. In August 1911, Shipman scored 69 runs, his highest ever in a first-class match, in the County Championship defeat to Warwickshire. He scored half-centuries on six occasions during his career. For the 1915 season, Shipman was the club professional for Nelson Cricket Club in the Lancashire League. He scored 417 runs and took 77 wickets during his time at Seedhill. In July 1921, after a seven-year absence from the Leicestershire team, Shipman returned to play his final first-class game for the county, taking six wickets in the win against Northamptonshire at Aylestone Road.

A standard-setting organisation, it promotes best practice and support childcare professionals to deliver high standards of care and learning. History PACEY was founded, as the National Childminding Association (NCMA), in 1977 by a small group of registered childminders, local authority staff and parents. Originally the Association covered the UK, but the Scottish Childminding Association (SCMA) and the Northern Ireland Childminding Association (NICMA) now support childminding in Scotland and Northern Ireland. NCMA changed its name to Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years in March 2013, to reflect the broadening of its membership to include nursery workers as well as childminders and nannies and the growing recognition of its members' professionalism. Organisation PACEY's President, since March 2013, is childcare expert and author Penny Tassoni. The Chair, since November 2014, is Jane Comeau, a full-time registered childminder. Liz Bayram has been the Chief Executive since December 2005. From 2009 until July 2013 she job-shared in this role with Catherine Farrell, who has now left PACEY. PACEY's head office is in Bromley, Kent. It also has an office in Cardiff, Wales. Registered childminders and nannies Registered childminders care for one or more children under the age of eight for more than a total of two hours a day, usually in the childminder's home, for payment. They are usually self-employed and are inspected by Ofsted in England or the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW), to ensure they are providing a safe and stimulating environment for these children. Unlike registered childminders, nannies are employed by parents and work in the family home. They are not required to register with Ofsted in England or with CSSIW in Wales. However, to reassure parents that they have had an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check, first-aid and basic childcare training, nannies can join the voluntary Ofsted register or CSSIW's Voluntary Approval Scheme. Research At its 2005 annual conference, the organisation's then-President, British childcare expert Dr Penelope Leach, outlined details of the findings of the longest and most detailed studies of UK childcare, which concluded that young children who are looked after by their mothers do significantly better in developmental tests than those cared for in nurseries, by childminders or relatives. It found babies and toddlers fared worst when they were given group nursery care. Those cared for by friends or grandparents or other relatives did a little better while those looked after by nannies or childminders were rated second only to those cared for by mothers. The study, by researchers led by Leach and colleagues Kathy Sylva and Alan Stein, began in 1998 and involved 1,200 children and their families from north London and Oxfordshire. Mothers were interviewed when their babies were three months old and again when they were 10, 18, 36 and 51 months. In March 2013 PACEY's report Childcare ‚Äì not just a job, a vocation, based on research carried out in association with Nursery World magazine and NannyTax, found that low pay and poor status are concerns across the childcare profession ‚Äì among childminders, nursery workers and nannies. In spite of this, the study found that for every ¬£1 childcare workers are paid, they generate between ¬£7 and ¬£9.50 worth of benefits to society. In September 2013 a survey by PACEY of more than 2,000 UK childcare workers, parents and teachers found that social skills and independence were rated more highly than key academic skills as indicators of young children's readiness to start school. Campaigns In 2001 the Association campaigned for a reversal of new government regulations which allowed childminders to smack babies and toddlers and to smoke in the presence of children with parents' consent. In April 2012 it launched a campaign, Individual Inspection Matters, calling on the Government to retain individual registration and inspection of childminders in England. The campaign was launched in response to concerns that the Government is planning to take childminding out of the current inspection and regulation system and that this could lead to deregulation or regulation with a \\"lighter touch\\". It expressed concern that stepping away from individual Ofsted inspection threatened childminders' professional status. In March 2013 Catherine Farrell, PACEY's then joint chief executive, criticised government plans to increase the number of children that childcare providers can look after in England and to introduce childminder agencies as being \\"likely to reduce quality for children\\".

He is remembered for the derision that greeted his Latin translations of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, which came to epitomise bad verse. He translated the original Greek into Latin hexameters. The satirist Persius poured scorn on Labeo. Later his name was used by English poets of the Elizabethan era to attack each other's verse. Work His writings have not survived, but a single line of his translation has been preserved in scholia: \\"crudum manduces Priamum Priamique pisinnos\\", which was Labeo's translation of the words - ·Ω†Œº√≤ŒΩ √üŒµ√üœÅœéŒòŒøŒπœÇ Œ†œÅŒØŒ±ŒºŒøŒΩ Œ†œÅŒπŒ¨ŒºŒøŒπ√≥ œÑŒµ œÄŒ±√ÆŒ¥Œ±œÇ (Iliad, iv, 35).Kirk Freudenburg, Satires of Rome: Threatening Poses from Lucilius to Juvenal, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2001, p.154. On the basis of this surviving line, it has been suggested that the translation was considered to be vulgar, since the words 'manduces' and 'pisinnos' would have \\"undoubtedly struck Romans as exotically 'low'\\".Kirk Freudenburg, The Cambridge companion to Roman satire, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p.137. In English the line means, roughly, \\"Raw, you'd chew both Priam and Priam's kids.\\" Persius Persius, a contemporary of the translator, refers to Labeo in his Satires as the epitome of a bad poet, mentioning him in his discussion of his reasons for taking up his pen: O curas hominum! o quantum est in rebus inane! \\"Quis leget haec?\\" min tu istud ais? Nemo hercule. \\"Nemo?\\" Vel duo, vel nemo. \\"Turpe et miserabile.\\" Quare? Ne mihi Polydamas et Tro√Øades Labeonem Praetulerint? Nugae! RGM Nesbitt translates these lines as: \\"The toils of men! The emptiness of life! 'Who's going to read that?' Are you talking to me? Nobody, of course. 'Nobody?' Well, two at the most. 'That's a poor show.' Why? Because Polydamas and the Trojan Women may prefer Labeo to me? Bosh.\\"RGM Nesbitt, \\"Persius\\" in J. P. Sullivan (ed), Critical Essays on Roman Literature: Satire, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1963, p.42. Polydamas was a Trojan leader in the Iliad characterised by his timidity. He and the women of Troy tried to stop Hector making a bold attack on the Greeks. Persius also says that Labeo must have made the translation while \\"drunk with hellebore\\" (ebria ueratro).J. Wight Duff, A Literary History of Rome in the Silver Age: From Tiberius to Hadrian, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1927, p.342. English satire Following Persius' use of the name, Elizabethan English satirists used the name \\"Labeo\\" as a code for a bad poet. \\"Labeo\\" appears in Joseph Hall's Satires, in which he is accused of writing bad pastoral, erotic and heroic verse, evidently a reference to poetry of the time. The identity of Hall's \\"Labeo\\" is disputed. It has been suggested that Michael Drayton may be the target.Bernard H. Newdigate, Michael Drayton and His Circle, Blackwell, Oxford, 1941 p.100 Samuel Daniel has also been suggested.Scott McCrea, The Case for Shakespeare, Praeger, Westport, 2005, p.138. However, it has been argued that Hall's \\"Labeo\\" is a composite figure, standing for the vulgarity of modern poetry, as Hall saw it. In the view of Oscar James Campbell, \\"The English Labeo is best regarded as a type figure representing each and every one of the assiduous and tasteless Elizabethan translators.\\"Oscar James Campbell, Comicall Satyre and Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida, C.F. Braun, 1965, p.47. Likewise, John Marston mentions \\"Labeo\\" in Pygmalion's Image, which includes the words, \\"So Labeo did complain his love was stone,/Obdurate, flinty, so relentless none.\\" It may be that this use of the \\"Labeo\\" persona is an attack on Shakespeare, since the lines resemble a passage in Venus and Adonis.Arnold Davenport (ed), The Poems of John Marston, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, 1961, p.216. John Milton in an early essay quotes Persius on Labeo, referring to academic rivalries, :So provocative of animosity, even in the home of learning, is the rivalry of those who pursue different studies or whose opinions differ concerning the studies they pursue in common. However, I care not if \\"Polydamas and the women of Troy prefer Labeo to me;--a trifle this\\".Phyllis B. Tillyard, E. M. W.

Agbogbloshie is a nickname of a commercial district on the Korle Lagoon of the Odaw River, near the center of Accra, Ghana's capital city. Near the slum called \\"Old Fadama\\", the Agbogbloshie site became known as a destination for externally generated automobile and electronic scrap collected from mostly the western world. It was alleged to be at the center of a legal and illegal exportation network for the environmental dumping of electronic waste (e-waste) from industrialized nations. The Basel Action Network, a small NGO based in Seattle, has referred to Agbogbloshie as a \\"digital dumping ground\\", where they allege millions of tons of e-waste are processed each year.\\"Africa‚Äôs Agbogbloshie Market Is a Computer Graveyard\\" NewsBreakingOnline.com. Web. 20 Feb. 2011. However, repeated international studies have failed to confirm the allegations, which have been labelled an \\"e-waste hoax\\" by international reuse advocate WR3A. The most exhaustive study of the trade in used electronics in Nigeria, funded by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Basel Convention, revealed that from 540 000 tonnes of informally processed waste electronics, 52% of the material was recovered. According to statistics from the World Bank, in large cities like Accra and Lagos, the majority of households have owned televisions and computers for decades. The UN Report \\"Where are WEEE in Africa\\" (2012) disclosed that the majority of used electronics found in African dumps had not in fact been recently imported as scrap, but originated from these African cities. Agbogbloshie is situated on the banks of the Korle Lagoon, northwest of Accra's Central Business District. Roughly 40,000 Ghanaians inhabit the area, most of whom are migrants from rural areas.\\"Time up for Sodom and Gomorrah.\\" Peace FM Online  Ghanaian News. 4 Sept. 2009. Web. 15 Mar. 2011. Due to its harsh living conditions and rampant crime, the area is nicknamed \\"Sodom and Gomorrah\\". The Basel Convention prevents the transfrontier shipment of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries. However, the Convention specifically allows export for reuse and repair under Annex Ix, B1110. While numerous international press reports have made reference to allegations that the majority of exports to Ghana are dumped, research by the US International Trade Commission found little evidence of unprocessed e-waste being shipped to Africa from the United States, a finding corroborated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Memorial University, Arizona State University, UNEP, and other research. In 2013, the original source of the allegation blaming foreign dumping for the material found in Agbogbloshie recanted, or rather stated it had never made the claim that 80% of US e-waste is exported. Whether domestically generated by residents of Ghana or imported, concern remains over methods of waste processing - especially burning - which emit toxic chemicals into the air, land and water. Exposure is especially hazardous to children, as these toxins are known to inhibit the development of the reproductive system, the nervous system, and especially the brain. Concerns about human health and the environment of Agbogbloshie continue to be raised as the area remains heavily polluted.\\"Poisoning the Poor ‚Äì Electronic Waste in Ghana  Greenpeace International.\\" Inspiring Action for a Green and Peaceful Future  Greenpeace USA. 5 Aug. 2008.

In the 2000s, the Ghanaian government, with new funding and loans, implemented the Korle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project (KLERP), an environmental remediation and restoration project that will address the pollution problem by dredging the lagoon and Odaw canal to improve drainage and flooding into the ocean. Background Korle Lagoon, in Ghana's capital city Accra. In the 1960s, the slum area of Agbogbloshie was a wetland. As the city of Accra urbanized, a ghetto grew, referred to as Old Fadama or Ayaalolo. During the 1980s, the ghetto was a place of shelter for refugees from the Konkomba-Nanumba war. In the late 1990s, newly available electricity from the Akosombo Dam led to increased local demand for electric and electronic appliance consumption. Critics claim that this caused an imbalanced shift. The electricity from the Akosombo dam increased demand for functional second-hand televisions and computers, these were imported from the West by Africa's Tech Sector to help ‚Äòbridge the digital divide‚Äô. Ghanaians welcomed these donations, because these computers cost one-tenth the price of a new one. The Basel Action Network circulated a claim in 2008 that as much as 75 percent of these second-hand electronics sent to Africa could not be reused and ended up in landfills.Darko, Richmond. \\"Electronic Waste Dumping on Ghana Still Continues.\\" GhanaWeb. 25 Aug. 2010. Web. 15 Mar. 2011. The BAN allegation was slightly different from its 2002 claim of 80% waste (Exporting Harm, 2002) which became one of the most cited references in academic journals, though no documentation or peer reviewed source documentation has been made available.\\"Mapping E-waste as a Controversy: From Statements to Debates II.\\" In 2013 BAN denied ever making the claim, or ever stating any statistic for African imports. Economy The local economy of Agbogbloshie is based on an onion market serving immigrants to Accra from the greater Tamale Region (Dagbani) in the north. Unemployed immigrants turned to scrap metal collection, including auto scrap, to supplement incomes. Electronic scrap processing is a fairly small activity at the market. The claim that \\"hundreds of millions of tons of electronic waste are imported to the area each year\\", as reported by several news sources, is considered by most experts to be utterly ridiculous and preposterous. The United States is definitely not the leading exporter of e-waste to Ghana, although imports arrive from other countries such as France, Germany, Korea, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Multinational brands such as Philips, Canon, Dell, Microsoft, Nokia, Siemens and Sony are commonly found throughout the waste. According to the E-Waste Assessment Studies, \\"Refurbishing of EEE and the sales of used EEE is an important economic sector (e.g. Alaba market in Lagos). It is a well-organized and a dynamic sector that holds the potential for further industrial development. Indirectly, the sector has another important economic role, as it supplies low and middle income households with affordable ICT equipment and other EEE. In the view of the sector‚Äôs positive socio-economic performance, all policy measures aiming to improve e-waste management in Nigeria should refrain from undifferentiated banning of second-hand imports and refurbishing activities and strive for a co-operative approach by including the market and sector associations.\\" Young men burning electrical wires to recover copper at Agbogbloshie, September 2019.

Web. 15 Mar. 2011. They claim, based on the 75%-80% orphaned waste statistic, that exporters must have found numerous loopholes to avoid legislation forbidding e-waste shipping, such as labeling broken electronics as ‚Äòend-of-life‚Äô or ‚Äòsecond-hand-goods‚Äô, falsely identifying them as in working order. If it were true that between 50% and 75% of the electronics imported are unable to be salvaged and remain on the land, the import would be illegal. However, the UN Studies have failed to find evidence of the allegation, and the only source of the dumping statistic has denied it. Young men burning wires from auto harnesses and electronics have been the subject of several photojournal essays. The workers, mostly young men, disassemble cars, appliances, and scrap electronics gathered in wheeled push carts from Accra neighborhoods. Revenue from the recovery of metals such as copper, aluminum and iron, produce very low wages. Several British news outlets have made the recycling workers a cause celebre.Monbiot, George. \\"From Toxic Waste to Toxic Assets, the Same People Always Get Dumped on.\\" Guardian.co.uk. 21 Sept. 2009. Web. 15 Mar. 2011. Photographs of workers burning old wire on top of tires and plastic in order to melt the plastic, or dismantling the waste with their bare hands and stones, have been popularized by the press. Magnets from electronics are shown used to gather the smallest of ferrous metal scraps. The remaining materials are further burned or dumped nearby. The workers, children and adults alike, sell the metal scraps to earn a living. A half a sack of copper or aluminum will sell for about 700 Ghana Cedis, amounting to about eight to ten Ghana cedis per day (4 to 6 USD).Nuvor, Francisca. \\"Ghana: E-waste Becoming Business.\\" AfricaNews.com. 28 Jan. 2011. Web. 15 Mar. 2011. Living conditions The population of Agbogbloshie consists of economic migrants from northern and rural parts of Ghana, where living standards are growing worse, causing people to move to urban settings, such as Agbogbloshie. Conditions may not be significantly better, but making a living is easier. Inhabitants of Agbogbloshie live, eat, work and relieve themselves on the land and amongst the waste. Children who are able to attend school often spend every evening and weekend processing waste searching for metals.Claiborne, Ron. \\"E-Waste in Africa, U.S. Trash Is Ghana's Problem.\\" ABC News. 2 Aug. 2009. Web. 20 Feb. 2011. Dwellings are wooden shacks that lack water and sanitation. The area is also home to armed robbers, prostitutes, drug dealers and others involved in underground markets. Crime and disease run rampant throughout Agbogbloshie, creating an almost uninhabitable environment for humans. Outsiders have nicknamed the area ‚ÄúSodom and Gomorrah,‚Äù after two condemned Biblical cities, due to the harsh living conditions in Agbogbloshie. Pollution A young man burning electrical wires to recover copper at Agbogbloshie, September 2019. The processing and dumping of electronic waste in Agbogbloshie is polluting the area and creating serious environmental concern. Photographs from the Agbogbloshie e-waste landfill show scrap workers burning wires from auto harnesses and plastic-encased electronics to recover copper. E-waste contains toxic chemicals that are emitted into the ground, water and atmosphere when the electronics are broken down, burned and processed. Poisons such as lead, mercury, arsenic, dioxins, furans, and brominated flame retardants seep into the surrounding soil and water, thereby seriously polluting the landscape. Greenpeace lab tests have shown the water and soil from areas in Agbogbloshie revealed the area contained concentrations of chemicals at levels a hundred times more than the allowable amount. Agbogbloshie e-waste workers completing a burn for copper recovery.Several studies have confirmed high levels of lead in soil with particular risks to workers and children. Environmental lead contamination is predominantly due to burning off the plastic covering from copper wires. PVC insulation contains approximately 3000 mg/kg lead as a stiffener, and this lead is released during the burning. The Guardian in April 2019 reported that a study for IPEN and the Basel Action Network found dangerous levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBS) in chicken eggs at Agbogbloshie. Lead containing glass used in computer monitors (CRT tubes) also contributes to elevated soil lead levels. The Korle Lagoon, on which Agbogbloshie is situated, has extremely low levels of dissolved oxygen, a result of the large and uncontrolled quantities of domestic and industrial waste being emitted into the water. Studies indicate that the entrance to the lagoon is severely polluted and not suitable for primary or secondary contact, due to the large amounts of bacteria present.Karikari, A. Y., K. A. Asante, and C. A. Biney. \\"Water Quality Characteristics at the Estuary of Korle Lagoon in Ghana.\\" 2009. Web. 15 Mar. 2011. Human health risks Processing electronic waste presents a serious health threat to workers at Agbogbloshie. The fumes released from the burning of the plastics and metals used in electronics are composed of highly toxic chemicals and carcinogens. Workers often inhale lead, cadmium, dioxins, furans, phthalates and brominated flame retardants. Pollution from the e-waste industry at Agbogbloshie is extensive.Exposure to these fumes is especially hazardous to children, as these toxins are known to inhibit the development of the reproductive system, nervous system, and the brain in particular. In similar e-waste processing areas, with conditions and demographics like those of Agbogbloshie, 80% of the children have dangerous levels of lead in their blood. Inhabitants often suffer from chronic nausea, headaches, chest and respiratory problems. High levels of toxins have also been discovered in soil and food samples, as these chemicals stay in the food chain. Information security E-waste presents a potential security threat to individuals and exporting countries. Hard drives that are not properly erased before the computer is disposed of can be reopened, exposing sensitive information. Credit card numbers, private financial data, account information and records of online transactions can be accessed by most willing individuals. Organized criminals in Ghana commonly search the drives for information to use in local scams. Government contracts have been discovered on hard drives found in Agbogbloshie. Multimillion-dollar agreements from United States security institutions such as the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Transportation Security Administration and Homeland Security have all resurfaced in Agbogbloshie.Doctorow, Cory. \\"Illegal E-waste Dumped in Ghana Includes Unencrypted Hard Drives Full of US Security Secrets.\\" Boing Boing. 25 June 2009. Web. 15 Mar. 2011. Restoration efforts The Ghanaian government has made an effort to restore the area through the ‚ÄúKorle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project‚Äù (KLERP). In 2003, the OPEC Fund for International Development, the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development provided a loan for this project with the expectation that the Ghanaian government dredge the lagoon and restore its surroundings. Other goals of the project include a reduction in flooding, an increase in marine life, an improvement of water quality and an improvement in general sanitary conditions.\\"Korle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project.\\" ADK Consortium. Web. 15 Mar. 2011. Due to the invasive nature of the project, these restoration efforts have been disputed by the inhabitants of Agbogbloshie. The KLERP requires the people to leave the area, which is the only home for a majority of squatters. The Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) has continually tried to evict the people, but have only been met with much resistance. The matter is still in dispute. In 2014, the NGO Pure Earth (formally Blacksmith Institute) funded the creation of a Copper Wire Recycling Center within Agbogbloshie and helped to install several automated machines to simplify the removal of plastic coating and reduce the burning. Efforts appear to be moderately successful; however, the burning continues. Since 2017, the German government supports Ghana in introducing sustainable e-waste management in the country.https://www.dw.com/en/germany-supports-e-waste-disposal-in- ghana/a-38015011 The E-waste programme is implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr internationale Zusammenarbeit in partnership with Ghanaian Ministry of Environment Science Technology and Innovation (MESTI).http://mesti.gov.gh/ghanas-biggest-e-waste-yard-receives-face-lift/ In March 2019 a training facility, a Ghana Health service clinic and a football pitch were completed and commissioned.https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/A-glimmer-of- hope-comes-to-Agbogbloshie-734022 References in popular culture * The official video of the Placebo cover of Talk Talk's song \\"Life's What You Make It\\" starts with \\"This film is dedicated to the workers of Agbogbloshie\\", and ends with \\"When you get rid of your cellphone, computer and home appliances, your cast-offs often go on a voyage across the oceans to Agbogbloshie.

P. falcaorum is solely known from early Miocene Burdigalian stage Dominican amber deposits on the island of Hispaniola. History and classification The species is known solely from the holotype specimen, a complete male fly. The specimen is currently residing in the phlebotomine sandfly collection in the Centro de Pesquisas Ren√© Rachou. The centro is part of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Minas Gerais Brazil. The specimen was collected from an unidentified amber mine in the Cordillera Septentrional north of Santiago de los Caballeros. The specimen was first studied by sandfly researchers Reginaldo Pe√ßanha Brazil and Jos√© Dilermando Andrade Filho. Brazil and Andrade Filho published their 2002 type description in the journal Mem√≥rias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz. The specific epithet \\"falcaorum\\" was coined by the author in honor of Alda and Alberto Falc√£o, to recognize their contributions to Phlebotominae understanding. Description A number of features in the specimen indicate its placement in the moth fly subfamily Phlebotominae and the tribe Lutzomyiina. The specimen displays pre-apical bristles, and four spines on the style, these features combined with the AIII flagellomere being over half the length of the head. This combination of features indicates a placement in the genus Pintomyia. Within the genus, it is placed in the subgenus Pifanomyia, based on the posterior femurs lack of spines, but the species does not resemble the known modern species-group series. The light coloration of the abdomen on P. falcaorum is unlike the P. monticola series, while the P. pacae series have papillpae on the AXIII segment. Papillae on the AV segment of the P. verrucarum, P. serrana and P. townsendi mark them as different from P. falcaorum. Like Pintomyia falcaorum the Dominican amber fly species Pintomyia paleotownsendi has a Sc vein that is free while the Sc meets the costa vein in P. paleotrichia. In contrast P. brazilorum, P. killickorum, Lutzomyia filipalpis, L. miocena, L. paleopestis, L. schleei, and L. succini all possess an Sc which meets the R1 vein. The presence of a forked Sc vein in the wings, found in some Lutzomyia species including L. adiketis, is unique among the described species of sandflies from Dominican amber. Living members of the Phlebotominae suck blood from vertebrates, and P. falcaorum is presumed to have done so as well. However, the host(s) of this species has not been identified at this time.

WPCU is federally insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which insures accounts in federal and most state- chartered credit unions in the United States. Deposits with Wright-Patt Credit Union are insured to $250,000. History The organization that is now Wright-Patt Credit Union was founded in 1932. It was during the national economic depression of the early 1930s (the Great Depression) that federal employees at Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) recognized the need for an ‚Äúevery person‚Äù financial institution. Since that time, WPCU has become Ohio's largest member-owned credit union and one of the largest in the United States. Today, WPCU serves thousands of members from numerous employer and community groups and associations. WPCU has been known by the following names since its inception: * In 1932 ‚Äì F.E.U. Local 148 Credit Union, * In 1948 ‚Äì Wright Field Credit Union, * In 1951 ‚Äì Dayton Federal Employees Credit Union, * In 1962 ‚Äì Wright-Patt Credit Union. Membership As with all credit unions, membership in Wright-Patt Credit Union is limited to individuals sharing the common bond defined in its credit union charter. WPCU primarily serves the Greater Dayton Area in the Miami Valley Region of Ohio, but other select areas are also eligible to join. Membership in WPCU is limited to the following: * Individuals who live, work, worship or attend school in Butler, Champaign, Clark, Clermont, Clinton, Darke, Delaware, Fairfield, Franklin, Greene, Hamilton, Licking, Madison, Miami, Montgomery, Pickaway, Preble, Union, or Warren Counties in Ohio. * Military and civilian employees of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB). * Military personnel residing in a 14-county area adjacent to the Fairborn area who do not have a credit union available. * Retired United States Government military and civilian personnel. * Government employees residing near WPAFB who do not have credit union facilities at their places of employment. * Wright State University students, faculty, staff, and Alumni Association members. * Select groups made up of people associated through employment, geographic location, or other organizational affiliation. * Spouses, children, and certain other relatives of those eligible for WPCU membership. Organization Wright-Patt Credit Union corporate office building in Beavercreek, Ohio Wright-Patt Credit Union is a state-chartered credit union in Ohio, federally insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Like all credit unions, WPCU is governed by a board of volunteers, elected by and from its membership. WPCU also owns a separate subsidiary, myCUmortgage, LLC, which operates as a Credit Union Service Organization (CUSO). CUSOs were established by NCUA as a way for credit unions to offer products and services that would normally be outside of the credit union's scope. Services Wright-Patt Credit Union offers a full selection of products and services typically found at most financial institutions, including savings accounts, checking accounts, consumer loans and certificates of deposit. Credit unions are financial cooperatives so their savings accounts are referred to and recorded as ‚Äúshares‚Äù because they represent members‚Äô ownership of the credit union. Anyone eligible for membership can become an owner of the credit union by opening an account and depositing $5.00 into a ‚Äúshare‚Äù savings account. Additionally, WPCU offers its members small business loans, auto loans, mortgage loans, student loans, credit cards, lines of credit, health savings accounts, IRA accounts, direct deposit (through ACH), telephone banking, online banking, mobile banking, and remote deposit as well as many other services. Member Center & ATM locations , Wright-Patt Credit Union operates 31 member centers (commonly called branches) around the Greater Dayton area, Cincinnati and Columbus in Ohio. They also partner with other ATM providers giving members lower-to-no- fee access to any Alliance One, CO-OP Network, or STAR ATM. WPCU has also partnered with other credit unions in the United States through the Shared Service Center network (CU Service Centers), which allows WPCU members to conduct most of their financial business at other credit union locations as if they were at their own local WPCU member center.

Under Zeltner's leadership, Switzerland developed in 1991 a pioneering illicit drug policy, which has received global attention. It is based on a 4-pillar strategy (prevention, harm reduction, therapy, and law enforcement), which is enshrined in the Swiss law on narcotic drugs. The harm reduction policy of Switzerland ‚Äì which includes large-scale syringe exchange programs (also in prisons) and the medical prescription of heroin for chronic heroin addicts ‚Äì was introduced against the strong opposition of the UN drug control authorities, but endorsed by a majority of the Swiss population in several popular referenda.

The Swiss model guarantees access to affordable insurance to all, even if they have pre-existing medical problems. All residents are required to buy insurance even if they are currently healthy, so that the risk pool remains reasonably favorable. Finally subsidies are given to low income families to pay for their premiums. Even though the Swiss pay 12.18% of the GDP for health (data 2018), a majority of 78% considers that the system works well or very well. The Swiss health care model is gaining increased international interest, particularly in the U.S. Zeltner was a member and Vice-President of the Executive Board of the World Health Organization (WHO) (1999-2002).

It was shot at Islington Studios,Wood p.78 with sets designed by the art director Alex Vetchinsky. Plot On the eve of his society wedding, Dudley Leake and his best man James Skippett get drunk at his bachelor party. While in his cups Dudley confides to his friend about a brief fling he had with a woman just before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. The following morning they oversleep and are late for their wedding. While they are dressing themselves Joe Piper, a young man with a strong Northern accent, appears at the flat and claims to be Dudley's illegitimate son from his pre-war tryst. The two men reject his claim, and leave him in the care of Allister the butler and hurry off to the wedding only to discover they have arrived too late. The ceremony has been postponed as the bride's family have gone. They hurry round to the Bogle household to try and justify their behaviour to Mary Bogle and her stern father. Rather than explain about being drunk, they claim they were called to an urgent business meeting and spend the rest of the day trying to produce a famous author \\"John Tempest\\" who they claim will provide them with an alibi about their late arrival. Allister the butler, meanwhile, has been unable to prevent Joe Piper discovering about the wedding and he also heads to the Bogle household and begins demanding large sums of money from Dudley in exchange for keeping quiet about their relationship. Skippett then persuade Joe Piper to pretend to be Tempest unaware that in real life she is actually a woman, and one of the bride's guests at the wedding. They slowly dig themselves deeper and deeper into a hole, and the Bogles prepare to leave for a holiday in the South of France. Eventually, after both Piper and Skippett have dressed up as women and pretended to be Tempest, the Bogles agree that Dudley can marry her daughter only for Piper to reveal to them that he was Dudley's \\"love child\\" when he is not paid the blackmail money he demands. The wedding is saved, however, when a police inspector arrives and reveals that Piper's real father is not Dudley but rather Mr Bogle who had also had a fling with his mother in 1914.

It is owned and operated by the S√ºdwestdeutsche Verkehrs- Aktiengesellschaft (SWEG), which in turn is owned by the state of Baden- W√ºrttemberg. The Kaiserstuhlbahn consists of two joined sections, from Gottenheim via Riegel Ort to Endingen am Kaiserstuhl, and Riegel DB station via Endingen am Kaiserstuhl to Breisach. Together these lines circumnavigate the Kaiserstuhl mountain range on its east, north and west sides. At both Gottenheim and Breisach junctions are made with the Freiburg to Breisach Railway, which completes the circumnavigation to the south. At Riegel DB station, a further junction is made to the Freiburg im Breisgau to Offenburg section of the mainline Rhine Valley Railway. The Kaiserstuhl Railway is the last, fully preserved and fully operational standard gauge line of the former South German Railway Company (SEG). The line is worked by passenger and goods trains as well as heritage line specials (the so-called Rebenbummler). The routes are also plied by buses. The railway's operations centre is the station of Endingen, in which the management, the depot and train sheds are located. Today Endingen, as the transport headquarters for Breisgau‚ÄìKaiserstuhl, runs the entire local passenger and goods services on all non-electrified railway lines in the Freiburg region.  History The Gottenheim‚ÄìRiegel am Kaiserstuhl Ort and Riegel-Malterdingen‚ÄìEndingen sections were opened on 15 December 1894 and the remaining Endingen‚ÄìBreisach section followed on 7 September 1895. It was built by the Baden railway consortium under the railway entrepreneur Herrmann Bachstein, who merged the railway into the South German Railway Company (S√ºddeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, SEG) on 8 December 1897 together with the Breg Valley Railway (Bregtalbahn) and the Zell im Wiesental‚ÄìTodtnau railway (Zell-Todtnauer-Eisenbahn) with effect from 1 April 1897. After the SEG decided not to extend the concession at the end of 1952 due to the high deficits of all of its branch lines, the Kaiserstuhl Railway was taken over by the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg with effect from 1 January 1953 and incorporated into Mittelbadische Eisenbahnen (Central Baden Railway). Under the MEG, the line began to be rationalised and modernised with the complete changeover to diesel operation, the introduction of train order operations and one-man operation for multiple units. From the mid-1950s, bus traffic became the second major component of passenger transport and had high growth rates. On 1 October 1971, the MEG merged with the S√ºdwestdeutsche Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (Southwest German Transport Company, SWEG) based in Lahr, which was renamed S√ºdwestdeutsche Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (Southwest German Transport Company) in 1984. As a result of the merger, the workshop of the Bad Krozingen‚ÄìM√ºnstertal railway (M√ºnstertalbahn) in Sulzburg was abandoned and the maintenance of the vehicles moved to Endingen. Regular operations of the museum steam train, the Rebenbummler, started in 1978.  S-Bahn operations  Together with other companies, the SWEG founded the Regio-Verkehrsverbund Freiburg (Freiburg regional transport union, RVF) on 1 January 1994. The concept of the Breisgau-S-Bahn envisaged integrated regular- interval services with modern lightweight railcars for the Freiburg‚ÄìBreisach line and the Kaiserstuhl Railway to better connect the Kaiserstuhl region to Freiburg. Every hour Regio-Shuttle RS1 are operated as line S5 from Breisach to Riegel-Malterdingen. An Alstom Coradia Continental (ET 1440) runs from Endingen a. K. to Gottenheim every 30 minutes as line S12. In 1995, SWEG and Freiburger Verkehrs AG, each with a 50 % share, founded a subsidiary, the Breisgau-S-Bahn (BSB), which took over operation on the Freiburg‚ÄìColmar railway in 1997. All traffic around the Kaiserstuhl was now in the hands of SWEG. The BSB took over the Elz Valley Railway (Elztalbahn) in 2002. A total of 21 Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 diesel railcars were procured for the lines of the Kaiserstuhl Railway, the Freiburg‚ÄìBreisach railway, Elz Valley Railway and the Bad Krozingen‚ÄìM√ºnstertal railway, all of which are stationed in Endingen. A cooperation agreement between RVG and Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Baden- W√ºrttemberg (\\"Baden-W√ºrttemberg Local Transport Company\\", NVBW) signed on 11 March 2009 included a commitment to electrify the S-Bahn network in the Freiburg region by 2018. The Breisach‚ÄìRiegel am Kaiserstuhl and Riegel am Kaiserstuhl Ort‚ÄìGottenheim lines were also to be electrified. The ground- breaking ceremony was held in April 2017. The overhead line was energised on 8 July 2019 at 19:00. Until January 2019, a mechanical interlocking of the Einheit class was operated in Gottenheim and until December 2019 in Breisach. Both stations are now remotely controlled from the \\"Breisach\\" work station at the electronic control centre in Freiburg-Wiehre. In the 2020 timetable, services were planned to be coupled or split every half hour in Gottenheim and hourly in Titisee. Due to problems in Gottenheim the point of separation was changed to Endingen a. K. In addition, there is only an hourly train between Titisee and Seebrugg on Sundays. However, trains kept failing, which was not well communicated. Therefore, a modified, less complicated timetable concept has applied to line S1 since 17 February 2020 under which the shuttle service between Gottenheim and Endingen a. K. remains; the coupling or splitting of trains is therefore no longer required in Gottenheim. This is intended to stabilise the timetable and ensure reliable operation. Those responsible want to return to the old timetable concept in June.  Rolling stock and operations  Fuchs 1928, ex Karlsruhe 545101P) The Kaiserstuhl Railway received five tank locomotives No. 333‚Äì337 of the Prussian T 3 class, 15 two- axle passenger cars with open platforms and skylight roofs, 9 freight wagons and three track maintenance wagons as initial equipment. Most of the freight wagons were later used by the state railway. All vehicles had Heberlein brakes until the introduction of the air brake in the 1930s. An important customer, the Riegel brewery in Riegel am Kaiserstuhl owned a large number of refrigerated wagons for transporting beer, all of which were hired as private freight wagons by the State Railways. The only remaining Riegel refrigerated beer wagon has been preserved as part of the museum steam train. In 1927, SEG introduced railcar traffic on the Kaiserstuhl Railway with internal combustion railcars, making SEG one of the first railways in Germany to use internal combustion railcars. In 1925, SEG procured a series of six railcars, No. T1 to T6, from Van der Zypen & Charlier, almost all of which also ran at least at times on the Kaiserstuhl Railway and of which the T24 (T4) was preserved as a museum item. The MAN T6 railcar was delivered in 1935 as a replacement for the fire-damaged T22. In 1927, the Kaiserstuhl Railway received the brand-new four-coupled steam locomotives no. 384 and 385 from Henschel, which correspond to the Henschel catalog class \\"Essen\\". Locomotive 384 has served since 1978 as a locomotive for the museum steam train, Rebenbummler, which consists entirely of former SEG vehicles from the Kaiserstuhl Railway and other SEG lines. In 1948, three used steam locomotives of the W√ºrttemberg T 6 class were purchased from Deutsche Bundesbahn, which were operated as no. 391, 393 and 394 at least until the middle of the decade. Locomotive 394 has been transferred to Europa- Park in Rust and is preserved. After the incorporation in MEG in 1953, the old fleet of original equipment from 1894/95 was largely scrapped and replaced with more modern or modernised wagons from other former SEG railways in Rhenish Hesse. All steam locomotives of the T3 class were scrapped during the 1950s. This was followed in 1956 by the purchase of a Krauss-Maffei ML 440 C. After purchasing several brand new MAN railbuses, VT23, VT25 and VT27, the old T22 and T24 railcars were only required as a reserve. From 1974 to 1985 the converted standard gauge former DB narrow gauge locomotive 252 902 (ex V 52 902), ex Mosbach‚ÄìMudau railway, was operated as V 46.01 on the Kaiserstuhl Railway. Today's Kaiserstuhl Railway fleet includes five Regio-Shuttles, several railcars and control cars of the NE 81 class, the MAN VT28 railbus and two diesel locomotives V102 and 103 (D 75 B'B') from Kaelble-Gmeinder, which were procured for the Kaiserstuhl Railway in 1985. It also has 15 buses. In 2014, SWEG invested in the renovation of the rail network.

Original in collection of RIBA, London Richmond House is a government building in Whitehall, City of Westminster, London. Its name comes from an historic townhouse of the Duke of Richmond that once stood on the site. History =Stewart Dukes of Richmond= Richmond House was first built as his London townhouse by Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox (1639-1672) of Cobham Hall in Kent, an English nobleman of Franco-Scottish ancestry and a 4th cousin of King Charles II of England. It was built shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy of 1660 when King Charles II returned to Great Britain from his exile in France during the Civil War and Commonwealth. It was built on the former bowling green of the royal Palace of Whitehall, at the southern end of the Privy Gardens.Walford, Old and New London, vol.3, 1873, p.377 Its west side looked onto Whitehall, but the main front looked northward towards the Banqueting House and Charing Cross. The 3rd Duke of Richmond died without issue in 1672 but his widow remained in occupation until her death in 1702. =Reversion to crown= After 1702 the house reverted to the crown and was occupied firstly by the Secretary of State and then by the Comptrollers of Army Accounts. =Lennox Dukes of Richmond= In 1710, during the reign of Queen Anne, the house was granted to Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, 1st Duke of Lennox (1672-1723), of Goodwood House in Sussex, the youngest of the seven illegitimate sons of King Charles II (by his mistress Louise de K√©rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth). Charles Lennox had in many ways been placed by the king into the persona of the deceased 3rd Duke of Richmond, whose family was much beloved by the Stuart monarchs. In 1733-4 His son Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, 2nd Duke of Lennox (1701-1750) built a new house adjacent to the first house, to the design of Lord Burlington (1694-1753), the pioneer of Palladian architecture in England. After 1738 he demolished the first house to improve his view. In 1747 he commissioned Canaletto to paint a pair of views from Richmond House, today in the collection of his descendant the 11th Duke of Richmond at Goodwood House. The 2nd Duke also enlarged his country seat at Goodwood House, to the designs of Matthew Brettingham. In 1758 his son Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 3rd Duke of Lennox (1735-1806) converted part of the house to a school for the study of painting and sculptureWalford, p.378 and in 1782 remodelled a part of it, to the designs of James Wyatt. =\\"House of the Earls of Loudoun and Mar\\"= thumb1807 engraving of the \\"House of the Earls of Loudoun and Mar\\".

In the background is Westminster Hall To the immediate west of Richmond House and adjoining Whitehall stood the \\"House of the Earls of Loudoun and Mar\\" (joint Secretaries of State of the Kingdom of Scotland 1705-1708/9), built 1687-93 by John Drummond, 1st Earl of Melfort (1650-1715), Secretary of State of the Kingdom of Scotland 1684-9, for use by holders of that office (abolished 1707) and demolished after 1820 to make way for Richmond Terrace built in 1822 and surviving today. It was divided into two separate dwellings, the leases of which were held personally after 1707 by the descendants of Loudon and Mar. Richmond House built by the 2nd Duke and burned down in 1791, stood to its east, closer to the river. The Loudoun and Mar house was acquired between 1766-90 by the 3rd Duke of Richmond, after which it also appears to have become known as \\"Richmond House\\". Destroyed by fire Richmond House was destroyed by a fire on 21 December 1791, and was not rebuilt by the 3rd Duke or his descendants. The library and art collection were rescued from the fire and were removed to Goodwood House, where the surviving two wings were built (to the designs of James Wyatt) to re-house them. The fire started in the bedroom of Henrietta Anne le Clerc, called \\"a proteg√©e of the Duchess\\" and \\"a long acknowledged daughter of His Grace\\", believed to have been the Duke's illegitimate daughter, to whom he referred in his will as \\"Miss Henrietta Anne le Clerc, who resides with me and though Christened by the name of Anne only is called Henrietta and whom I have [educated?] from her childhood\\" and to whom he bequeathed an annual income of ¬£2,000 (also leaving ¬£10,000 to each of his three illegitimate daughters by his housekeeper Mrs Bennet). The events are recorded as follows in The Annual Register of 1791: . Replaced by Richmond Terrace Richmond Terrace, built in 1822 on the site of Richmond House, destroyed by fire in 1791, with same orientation. Viewed from Whitehall, which leads at right southward to the Palace of Westminster. The Government building completed in 1987 known as \\"Richmond House\\" or \\"79 Whitehall\\" is immediately behind Richmond Terrace, with an entrance from Whitehall, formerly the entrance to Richmond House Mews The lease of the site passed to other ownership and in 1822 was built the surviving structure of eight large terraced houses known as \\"Richmond Terrace\\", occupying approximately the same footprint and orientation. These became fashionable private residences, until the 1920s when the leases expired and they returned to use as government offices until the redevelopment of 1982. 1980s redevelopment In 1987 Richmond Terrace Mews, behind the building, was built over and joined to the rear of Richmond Terrace to form a modern government office block to house the headquarters of the Department for Health and Social Security, the main entrance to which was number 79 WhitehallPostal address 79 Whitehall, London, SW1A 2NS (formerly the entrance to the mews). The ministerial team and key National Health Service officials were based there until November 2017. The new building was designed by Sir William Whitfield, and was completed in 1987. Site for temporary Parliament In January 2018, the House of Commons voted to move to Richmond House in 2025, for an estimated six years, to allow a full renovation of the Palace of Westminster, which accommodates the Houses of Commons and Lords. Plans revealed in October 2018 indicated that most of the 1980s structure would be demolished in preparation for this move, with only the facade retained in front of a new building designed by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, containing a permanent chamber and offices.

Most of the rooms are empty, but it contains a limited display of traditional objects from different regions of Guinea, as well as objects and statues from the colonial era. Various craft items are for sale. Location The Sandervalia National Museum is located near the Ignace Deen Hospital on the 7th boulevard in Kaloum, in the Sandervalia quarter of Conakry. The museum is located in a park in the Sandervalia district that had large trees, all but one of which has been cut down. One wing has been restored with the support of the Embassy of Japan. A masonry box built in 1896 by Aim√© Olivier de Sanderval is found to the right of the entrance. It is a curious concrete arch that is sometimes used informally by artists to exhibit their paintings. History Between 1959 and 1984 Guinea was controlled by a totalitarian state that established Islam as the state religion and confiscated almost all religious art. In parallel, a policy to encourage traditional folklore led to foundation of the museum, Les Ballets Africains and Radio T√©l√©vision Guin√©enne. The museum was founded in 1960 to house examples of traditional arts. After the military coup of 1984 the restrictions on indigenous religion were lifted. The museum, with much of its collection now lost, became a center for the small artistic community in Conakry. In the early 1990s it sponsored various conferences for citizens interested in culture. As of 2007 the oldest pieces had long disappeared and the museum was described as more of a shop than a museum. The museum was used as a meeting place in 2014 for the steering committee organizing the festivities in Mamou for the 56th anniversary of independence. In 2016 the painter Papus had his workshop in the museum. The museum was open from 9:00 to 15:00 and from 16:00 to 18:00 on Sundays, and from 16:00 to 18:00 on public holidays. It is also used for art exhibitions and other cultural events. Collection The museum has a collection of antique objects from around the country that represent different cultures and ethnicities, as well as objects from the colonial era. The collection included masks and a sacred forest. As of 2016 the building was empty apart from one room, which had a number of masks and musical instruments from different parts of Guinea. There is a model at the end of the permanent exhibition representing the houses of different regions of the country. Beside this room there is an artisan gallery where various items were exhibited for sale such as fabrics, traditional costumes, wooden statues and embossed Tuareg leather. Statues from the colonial era are collected in the courtyard of the museum. They represent historical figures of Guinea and included Almamy Samori Ture. There are statues of Sanderval, of the Governor No√´l Ballay by the sculptor H. Allourd, of Doctor Victor Le Moal (1876‚Äì1908), and of Monseigneur Raymond Ren√© L√©rouge (1876‚Äì1949) surrounded by musicians and a fisherman with his wife and children. The courtyard contains a buffet restaurant. Its railings are curiously decorated with colonial helmets. The cafeteria is in a hut wearing a giant colonial helmet, apparently an empty tribute to the French colonialists.

Perpetuating the Vermont Light Artillery Batteries of the American Civil War and subsequent Vermont artillery units, the regiment was organized following World War II as the 206th Field Artillery Battalion in the Vermont National Guard. The 206th saw active service in Germany with the 43rd Infantry Division during the Korean War, and became the 124th Artillery, a Combat Arms Regimental System parent regiment, in 1959. Represented by the 1st Howitzer Battalion, 124th Artillery, the regiment was renumbered as the 86th Artillery in 1964 when the 1st Battalion became the brigade artillery battalion of the 86th Armored Brigade. The 1st Battalion served in that role with the brigade for much of the rest of its existence. History = Origins = The 86th Field Artillery traced its lineage back to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Vermont Light Artillery Batteries of the American Civil War. Artillery returned to the Vermont Volunteer Militia on 22 November 1867 when a three-section light artillery battery headquartered at Springfield was organized. The volunteer militia battery was reduced to a section at Northfield known as the Norwich Cadets, composed of Norwich University students, on 27 November 1872. The Vermont Light Battery was reorganized on 11 April 1877 at Brattleboro, including the Norwich Cadets. The volunteer militia became the Vermont National Guard in 1894 and on 10 August 1899 the battery was disbanded. The Norwich Cadets continued as a battery and on 19 November 1907 expanded into Battery A, Light Artillery, and Company A, Signal Corps. Both units were converted into the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry on 1 January 1911. The squadron was mustered into Federal service on 24 June 1916 at Fort Ethan Allen when the National Guard was mobilized for duty on the Mexican border to replace Federal troops sent on the Pancho Villa Expedition. The squadron did not leave for the border as it was disbanded at Fort Ethan Allen less than a month later on 19 July. In the same year, the Norwich Cadets ceased being part of the National Guard and became a Reserve Officers' Training Corps unit. = 206th Field Artillery Battalion = The lineage of the Vermont Light Battery continued when it was reconstituted in the Vermont National Guard on 3 July 1946 as the 206th Field Artillery Battalion, part of the 43rd Infantry Division. The 206th, the first Vermont National Guard artillery unit since 1911, and the 172nd Infantry Regiment made up the bulk of the Vermont Army National Guard and were its only combat units in the early postwar period. The 206th received the heraldry of the 251st Field Artillery Battalion, which had served in the Pacific during World War II, although it did not perpetuate the lineage of the 251st. The headquarters and headquarters battery of the 206th at Burlington was organized and Federally recognized on 3 April 1947. In the following months, the rest of the battalion was organized and Federally recognized: Service Battery at Winooski on 16 April, Battery B at Essex Junction on 21 July, Battery A and the Medical Detachment at Waterbury on 13 November, and Battery C at Rutland on 14 November. In early June the 206th saw their first state call-up to maintain order after Rutland was struck by a flood, and in early August headquarters and headquarters and service batteries attended their first two-week annual training at Camp Johnson. Like much of the Vermont Army National Guard, the 206th was significantly understrength and by mid-1950 totalled 297 officers and men. The unit participated in annual training with the other Vermont units of the 43rd Division during August at Camp Edwards, Massachusetts in 1948 and 1949. It was ordered into active Federal service on 5 September 1950 during the Korean War with the rest of the 43rd. The 206th went to Germany with the division and when the active service term of its Guardsmen ended they returned to Vermont, forming the 206th Field Artillery Battalion in the replacement National Guard of the United States (NGUS). The NGUS unit was organized and Federally recognized on 30 December 1952, headquartered at Fort Ethan Allen. The 43rd units in Germany were reflagged as units of the 5th Infantry Division after the last of the Guardsmen returned to the United States, with the 206th becoming the 50th Field Artillery Battalion on 15 June 1954. The 206th continued as part of the Vermont National Guard and on 1 January 1955 its headquarters location was changed to Winooski. = 1st Battalion, 86th Field Artillery = When the Combat Arms Regimental System was introduced, the 206th was reorganized and redesignated as the 124th Artillery on 1 March 1959. It thus became a parent regiment represented by the 1st Howitzer Battalion, 124th Artillery, which continued as part of the 43rd. When the division was inactivated during a reorganization of the National Guard, the regiment was renumbered as the 86th Artillery on 1 February 1964 with the 1st Howitzer Battalion becoming the 1st Battalion, 86th Artillery. The latter was part of the 86th Armored Brigade, formed from the Vermont units of the 43rd. By 1966, Headquarters Battery was located at Williston, Battery A at Waterbury, Battery B at Vergennes, and Battery C at Northfield. The brigade joined the 50th Armored Division on 1 February 1968 during another National Guard reorganization, but on 1 June 1975 the battalion became a nondivisional unit. The battalion rejoined the 86th Brigade on 1 May 1980. It formed part of the 86th Brigade of the 50th Armored together with the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 172nd Armor during this period. The battalion transferred with the brigade to the 26th Infantry Division on 1 June 1988. The regiment continued in existence as a parent regiment when the United States Army Regimental System was introduced for the National Guard on 1 May 1989. When the 26th was inactivated on 1 September 1993, the 1st Battalion remained as the artillery battalion of the brigade. Roughly half of the 1st Battalion, 86th Field Artillery, 193 personnel, were mobilized for active duty in January 2004 as Task Force Redleg. With their M109A5 155 mm self-propelled howitzers redundant for counterinsurgency warfare, the detachment of the battalion received six weeks of military police training at Fort Dix and arrived in Iraq in March. They served on convoy escort duty in southern Iraq under the control of the 16th Military Police Brigade. On 25 May two soldiers of the detachment were killed in a mortar attack on Forward Operating Base Kalsu. The 1st Battalion detachment lost three killed in action, one died of natural causes, and 22 wounded during the nearly yearlong deployment. The 16th Military Police Brigade and its attached units were awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation in recognition of their actions. After the detachment returned to Vermont in February 2005, the battalion reequipped with 105 mm towed howitzers after the 2006 annual training. The 1st Battalion was inactivated in 2010.

Location Beja Airport, located northwest of Beja, is away from Lisbon, from Faro and less than from Spain. Beja is a city in the Beja Municipality in the Alentejo Region, Portugal, with a total area of and a total population of 34,970 inhabitants. The city proper has a population of 21,658. History An airbase was established on 21 October 1964, originally built to serve as a training facility for the West German Air Force, due to airspace limitations within West Germany. Until 1993, it was used particularly for weapons training, and in 1987 the Portuguese Air Force's 103 Squadron and its Lockheed T-33 and Northrop T-38 aircraft was relocated from Montijo. After their arrival, the base started to host a mixed array of fixed and rotary-wing trainers, as well as maritime patrol aircraft. Along with the airports in Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Funchal (Madeira), Porto Santo, Flores, Santa Maria, Ponta Delgada and Horta, the airport's concessions to provide support to civil aviation was conceded to ANA Aeroportos de Portugal on 18 December 1998, under provisions of decree 404/98. With this concession, ANA was also provided to the planning, development and construction of future infrastructures. In 2011, a new civilian terminal was built and Beja became a dual-use military-civilian airport, aiming to attract low-cost carriers. The inaugural flight to Praia, Cape Verde, took place on 13 April 2011.Aeroporto de Beja: voo inaugural √© hoje Governo Civil de Beja, April 2011. Retrieved June 2012 There were also charter flights to the United Kingdom. In spite of being the only Portuguese airport in Alentejo--the biggest Portuguese region, with an area comparable to the size of Belgium--the airport failed to attract the attention of low-cost carriers and has never had any scheduled regular flights. As of September 2012, plans to reconvert it into cargo use are under discussion. It may possibly be a logistics platform between the goods that are shipped to the nearby Port of Sines and the whole of Europe. In September 2013, it was announced that Aigle Azur would start seasonal flights from Paris to Beja but the airline filed for bankruptcy and was placed in receivership on 2 September 2019. As of September 2012, the future of the airport remains uncertain. The authorities are studying the possibility of reconverting the airport to cargo use. While the airport has no scheduled passenger flights, it is used by Hi Fly and its Maltese subsidiary for parking aircraft. A related sister company is also building a new hangar at the airport for the maintenance of both Hi Fly planes and third-party Airbus aircraft, supplementing its operations at Humberto Delgado Airport.

Pattanaik has written several books on myths and rituals already, but The Pregnant King is his first work of fiction, a retelling of the Yuvanashva tale to examine gender roles, the blurring of lines between parental duties and the malleability of Dharma to fit a given situation. The conflict between desire and social obligation/destiny is a major theme in the book. It also speaks about questions around the idea of gender.  Synopsis  The chronology of events as recorded in the Mahabharata has been manipulated and the story of Yuvanashva, replete with characters churned out of the author's imagination, has been woven in. The protagonist, King Yuvanashva is the well liked ruler of Vallabhi, an obedient son, a devoted husband who aspires to be just towards all and uphold Dharma in his kingdom. From the onset of the story, the epic battle of Kurukshetra is imminent but the king's mother, Shilavati, refuses to give her consent since he's yet to sire an heir. Despite having three wives and several years of futile rituals the king has reached a point of desperation. So he seeks the help of the two Siddhis, Yaja and Upayaja, who after an elaborate ritual create a potion meant for his queens but drinks it ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô and ends up pregnant himself. The incident is hidden from everyone including the child except the wives, Shilavati and Asanga, the healer. After given birth to son, Mandhata, he successfully impregnates his second wife, Pulomi. The king who has lived his whole life by the code of Dharma now finds himself in a dilemma. ‚ÄúI am not sure that I am a man‚Ä¶I have created life outside me as men do. But I have also created life inside me, as women do. What does that make me? Will a body such as mine fetter or free me?‚Äù The irony of the whole story is that the king who is supposed to be the epitome of manhood and upholder of Dharma longs till his last breath to be called ‚Äòmother‚Äô just once by Mandhata. \\"What sounds sweetest, being called Mother or being called Father\\"? The novel also delves into the stories of other characters like Shilavati, the ambitious and sharp princess who cannot be king because she's a woman. Widowed at a young age she becomes the regent but this disturbs the Brahmin elders because ‚Äúthey were not used to a leader who nursed a child while discussing matters of dharma‚Äù. (It's notable that the unconventionality of Shilavati's own life doesn't make her any more tolerant of her son's situation later on, which underlines the point that non-conformity/anti-tradition can take many forms, and these aren‚Äôt always kindred spirits.) It also tells the story of Somvat and Sumedha, two childhood friends who decide to get married despite being men. Sthunakarna, a yaksha, who forsakes his manhood to make Shikhandi a husband and then reclaims it to make Somvat a wife. Arjuna, the great warrior with many wives forced to masquerade as a eunuch after being castrated by a nymph. Adi-natha, the teacher of teachers, worshipped as a hermit by Yaja and an enchantress by Upayaja. It's also the story of the patron god of Vallabhi, Ileshwar Mahadev, who becomes God on full moon days and Goddess on new moon nights. = Critique = Throughout the book, the author highlights the paradoxes and ambiguities of gender and thus, life. He also uses the shift in chronology to use episodes in the epic of Mahabharata as parallels or counterpoints for the Yuvanashva story. The characters in this book make chatty references to the lives of their more famous contemporaries in Hastinapur as mentioned in the Mahabharata. The question of whether the 'impotent' Pandu and the 'blind' Dhritrashtra were fit to become kings is set against similar dilemmas involving characters in Vallabhi. There's some healthy irreverence on view: when a messenger arrives with the momentous news that the war is over, no one in the kingdom is particularly interested, being more concerned about internal matters. When the hero Arjuna makes what amounts to a guest appearance and is asked about a story Bhishma narrated to the Pandavas before he died, his reply is a curt, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but I remember no such story. He said so many things‚Äù ‚Äì a neat dismissal of the ponderous Shanti Parva, Bhishma's long deathbed discourse about a king's duties. The story largely seems obsessed with the definition of gender, man? or women? does the flesh matter? What about the soul? It also talks about marriage and child birth. There are multiple references to bulls, fields, soil and seeds as euphemisms for sex and conception, and to illuminate the vexing question of ‚Äúownership‚Äù that arises when a woman is made pregnant by someone other than her husband. And then there are those troublesome dead ancestors, the ‚Äúpitrs‚Äù, waiting for the arrival of a child so they can be reborn in the land of the living. Taking the form of crows, they perch outside bedchambers, waiting for quick results, flapping their wings impatiently when foreplay goes on for too long. (‚ÄúDoes it not bother you that your son‚Äôs seed is weak?‚Äù one of them indelicately asks Shilavati.) The Pregnant King isn't a consistently satisfying work ‚Äì It keeps the reader interested for the larger part but at places it's punctuated with staccato sentences (‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they were. Vehicles of an idea. Two ideas. No. One idea, two expressions. Two halves of the same idea. Mutually interdependent‚Äù) that have a broader philosophy. The occasional forced attempt at informality, and some philosophical statements towards the end (‚ÄúWithin you is your soul, Adi-natha as Shiva, silent, observant, still. Around you is matter, Adi-natha as Shakti, ever-changing, enchanting, enlightening, enriching, empowering‚Äù). But in a sense, this book is meant for just such readers as the author hopes to make us realise that in the rush to deem situations Black or White, the vast expanse of grey needs to be acknowledged and dealt with as well. ‚ÄúThe imperfection of the human condition and our stubborn refusal to make room for all those in between‚Äù is a cautionary tale for our own times. The book tells a striking story which meanders in various directions.  Adaptations  The book was adapted into a play, Flesh, in 2015, by director and script writer Kaushik Bose. The play revolves around the question of gender and motherhood. The play was produced by Theatreworms Productions. References External links * Official Site contains more information.

An ethno-national group, Haitians generally comprise the modern descendants of self-liberated Africans in the Caribbean territory historically referred to as Saint- Domingue. This includes the mulatto minority who denote corresponding European ancestry, notably from French settlers. By virtue of historical distinction, the vast majority of Haitians share and identify with this common African lineage, though a small number are descendants of contemporary immigrants from the Levant who sought refuge in the island nation during World War I and World War II. Definitions According to the Constitution of Haiti, a Haitian citizen is: * Anyone, regardless of where they are born, is considered Haitian if either their mother or father is a native-born citizen of Haiti. A person born in Haiti could automatically receive citizenship. * A foreigner living in Haiti who has had a continuous period of Haitian residence for five years can apply for citizenship and will have the right to vote, but is not eligible to hold public office until five years after their date of naturalization, excluding those offices reserved for native-born Haitians by Constitutional law. =Dual citizenship= The Haitian Constitution of 2012 re-legalizes dual citizenship, allowing for Haitians living abroad to own land and run for Haitian political office (except for offices of president, prime minister, senator or member of the lower house of Parliament). Ethnic groups Schoolchildren from Hinche (Centre) Haiti's population is mostly of African descent (5% are of mixed African and other ancestry), though people of many different ethnic and national backgrounds have settled and impacted the country, such as Poles (Polish legion), Jews, Arabs (from the Arab diaspora), Chinese, Indians, Spanish, Germans (18th century and World War I), Italians, and French, most marrying into the majority black populace and in turn yielding mixed race children (many of whom are prominent in Haitian society). Languages The official languages of Haiti are French and Haitian Creole. Traditionally, the two languages served different functions, with Haitian Creole the informal everyday language of all the people, regardless of social class, and French the language of formal situations: schools, newspapers, the law and the courts, and official documents and decrees. However, because the vast majority of Haitians speak only Creole, there have been efforts in recent years to expand its use. In 1979, a law was passed that permitted Creole to be the language of instruction, and the Constitution of 1983 gave Creole the status of a national language. However, it was only in 1987 that the Constitution granted official status to Creole. Culture =Art= Haitian art, known for its vibrant color work and expressive design, is a complex tradition, reflecting strong African roots with Indigenous American and European aesthetic and religious influences. It is a very important representation of Haitian culture and history. Haitian art is distinctive, particularly in painting and sculpture where brilliant colors, naive perspective and sly humor characterize it. Frequent subjects in Haitian art include big, delectable foods, lush landscapes, market activities, jungle animals, rituals, dances, and gods. Artists frequently paint in fables. =Music and dance= The music of Haiti combines a wide range of influences drawn from the many people who have settled on this Caribbean island. It reflects French, African rhythms, Spanish elements and others who have inhabited the island of Hispaniola and minor native Taino influences. Youth attend parties at nightclubs called discos, (pronounced \\"deece-ko\\"), and attend Bal. This term is the French word for ball, as in a formal dance. Styles of music unique to the nation of Haiti include music derived from Vodou ceremonial traditions and M√©ringue, Rara parading music, Twoubadou ballads, Mini-jazz rock bands, Rasin movement, Hip hop Krey√≤l, and Compas. Compas, short for compas direct, is a complex, ever-changing music that arose from African rhythms and European ballroom dancing, mixed with Haiti's bourgeois culture. It is a refined music, with m√©ringue as its basic rhythm. In Creole, it is spelled as konpa dir√®k or simply konpa, however it is commonly spelled as it is pronounced as kompa. Until 1937, Haiti had no recorded music, until Jazz Guignard was recorded non-commercially. One of the most celebrated Haitian artists today is Wyclef Jean. Wyclef Jean, however, left the country before his teenage years and began the Fugees with Lauryn Hill and Pras, who together went on to become the biggest selling hip hop group of all time with The Score released in 1996. =Cuisine= A table set with Haitian cuisine Haitian cuisine originates from several culinary styles from the various historical ethnic groups that populated the western portion of the island of Hispaniola. Haitian cuisine is similar to the rest of the Latin-Caribbean. Staple Haitian dishes include legim (or legume, typically made with eggplant, chocho, cabbage, carrot, onions, beef, conch, and/or crab), griyo (friend pork), and diri djon djon (aka black rice, a rice dish that gets its black coloring from soaked dried mushroom). =Religion= Haiti is similar to the rest of Latin America, in that it is a predominantly Christian country, with 80% Roman Catholic and approximately 16% professing Protestantism. A small population of Muslims and Hindus exist in the country, principally in the capital of Port-au-Prince. Vodou, encompassing several different traditions, consists of a mix of Central and Western African, European, and Native American (Ta√≠no) religions, is also widely practiced, despite the negative stigma that it carries both in and out of the country. The exact number of Vodou practitioners is unknown; however, it is believed that a small proportion of the population practice it, often alongside their Christian faith. Some secular Christians also have been known to participate in some rituals, although indirectly.  Migration  In 1998, a World Bank estimation claimed that approximately 800,000 Haitian citizens were residents of Dominican Republic. By 2001, approximately 15,000 Haitians had migrated to Dominican Republic to work in sugar mills. Haitians workers also migrated to other countries such as the United States, France, Canada, the Bahamas and other Caribbean Islands. In 2006, Approximately 800,000 Haitians resided in the United States (especially in the Miami and New York City areas), 60,000 Haitians were living in France (especially Paris) 40,000 in Canada (especially Montreal) while 80,000 were dispersed between the Bahamas and other Caribbean Islands.The Haitian migration has greatly hindered the development of Haiti in comparison to other countries. Some of the country's most skilled individuals have migrated elsewhere; an estimated 70 percent of Haiti‚Äôs skilled human resources have left Haiti. In the 2010 U.S. Census, 907,790 citizens identified as Haitian immigrants or with their primary ancestry being Haitian. An increase of just over 100,000 Haitians from 2006. The confiscation of property, massacres, and prosecution caused the upper and middle class of Haiti to migrate to more developed countries in Europe and the United States.

Summary Half Broke Horses is the story of Lily Casey Smith's life. Author Jeannette Walls, the granddaughter of Lily Casey Smith, wrote the book from Lily's perspective. Walls portrays her grandmother, Lily, as a strong, spirited, and resourceful woman, who overcomes poverty and tragedy with the positive attitude that ‚ÄúWhen God closes a window, he opens a door. But it‚Äôs up to you to find it.‚Äù As a child growing up on the frontier in Texas, Lily learns how to break horses. At the age of fifteen, she rode five hundred miles, alone, to get to her job as a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse. Later in her life, Lily runs a vast cattle ranch in Arizona, along with her second husband and their two children. A woman of many talents, Lily earns extra money at various points in her life by playing poker, selling bootleg liquor, and riding in horse races. Lily also tries to fight injustice and prejudice wherever she finds it, which occasionally lands her in trouble. Half Broke Horses depicts the freedom of rural life, its joys and struggles, and celebrates the courage and spirit of its protagonist, Lily Casey Smith. Walls says the book is ‚Äúin the vein of an oral history, a retelling of stories handed down by my family through the years, and undertaken with the storyteller‚Äôs traditional liberties.‚ÄùWalls, Jeannette. Half Broke Horses. Scribner, 2009. Reception In The New York Times Book Review, critic Liesl Schillinger wrote, \\"Through the adventures of Lily Casey ‚Äî mustang breaker, schoolteacher, ranch wife, bootlegger, poker player, racehorse rider, bush pilot and mother of two ‚Äî Walls revisits the adrenaline-charged frontier background that gave her own mother a lifelong taste for vicissitude.

A clone of the attraction opened at SeaWorld San Diego until January 10th 2020 when the ride closed for good. The attraction is combined with an animal exhibit featuring beluga whales, walruses, and harbor seals. This attraction replaced Mission: Bermuda Triangle at both locations. Guests have the option to ride on a non motion gyrostabilized helicopter, completely bypassing the motion simulation. The same video that is played in the motion ride is played in the non motion theater, but watching is optional as guests can walk through the room at any time. The ride was manufactured by Reflectone. It uses the same motion technology as multi-million dollar commercial and military flight simulation training devices. In 2019, Seaworld announced on it‚Äôs Instagram page that the San Diego location would close on January 10, 2020. Attraction summary =Entrance= Guests queue outside the \\"Franklin Exploration Center\\", where it is presumed that they are waiting to board a helicopter which will take them to \\"Base Station: Wild Arctic\\". The queue outside the attraction includes numerous murals of the Arctic animals and scenery as well as various HD TV monitors that show various clips about the Arctic and its animals running on a loop. Guests then enter the show building. =Gate boarding rooms= Once inside the building, guests are divided into either traveling by helicopter (the ride portion) or traveling by foot / walking (in which they view the ride film without the motion). Guests who require stationary seating are taken directly to a Gate Boarding Room B where they view the ride film and then the interactive animal exhibit. Guests experiencing the actual ride are taken into a room with an information board showing the flight departure schedule, as well as a large projection screen in front of them which shows another random clip about facts of the Arctic. From here, guests enter the pre-flight boarding station where they line up into multiple rows to prepare for their helicopter flight. Soon, a video comes on the screen in which the Operations Coordinator for the Franklin Exploration Center explains that the center is a support facility for Base Station Wild Arctic, and that both facilities were founded by Thomas Purcell in 1937, who strived to have man survive in the Arctic climate to research the area. The Coordinator further explains that guests will be traveling to Base Station Wild Arctic in the White Thunder helicopter. A brief restriction spiel is played before she then turns the show over to Co-Pilot Norm \\"Snowman\\" Miller. Miller begins to explain that the White Thunder is being piloted by Captain Emerson, but is interrupted by White Thunder's computer, which warns of a severe arctic storm in their path. Miller then explains the safety rules to guests, and ends the video. The doors to White Thunder then open, and guests board the ride vehicle via a drawbridge- style ramp. This pre-show has been removed as of 2018 in San Diego and has been updated with a new pre-show explaining animals in the attraction then turning to a crew member for safety information. The ride itself was not altered and stayed the same. The Orlando version has not changed since the ride opened. =Ride= Wild Arctic Flight Simulator Motion Ride Once guest have been seated and secured seat belts, the doors close, and Captain Emerson begins departing White Thunder from the Franklin Exploration Center, explaining to guests that he expects a short, comfortable flight to Base Station \\"Wild Arctic\\". Soon, Emerson begins flying the helicopter down to observe a polar bear family and then pilots White Thunder to switch to a water mode to dive into the Arctic waters to observe some Narwhals. Soon after the helicopter is piloted above water again, where Emerson warns that the Arctic storm is picking up and he has a warning indicator on his computer. Emerson lands the helicopter on a glacier to check the problem, which soon begins breaking apart due to the weight of the jet. Emerson struggles to get the engine to start, and the helicopter is soon caught in a rock slide before it begins flying again. The computer then dies out, and Emerson decides to use a shortcut to Base Station Wild Arctic to avoid the storm. Soon, White Thunder is caught in an avalanche and ice flow until Emerson narrowly escapes the storm by piloting through a narrow cavern, and to safety. The jet then arrives at Base Station Wild Arctic, and Emerson thanks guests and bids them farewell as they explore the research station. The doors then open, and guests exit the ride into Base Station Wild Arctic. =Post-show & exhibit= File:Sea World- Wild Arctic.jpgPolar bear File:Wild Arctic - SeaWorld San Diego.jpgPolar bear File:Wild Arctic - SeaWorld San Diego (2).jpgPolar bears File:Sea World- Wild Arctic (2).jpgBeluga whales File:Wild Arctic - SeaWorld San Diego (3).jpgBeluga whales under water Following the ride, guests enter Base Station Wild Arctic, which consists of a re-created Arctic Research Station built around two sailing ships which are trapped in the ice. The story surrounding the ships are taken from the 1845 expedition of Captain John Franklin and his ships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. It has been one of the enduring mysteries of Arctic exploration: What happened to the two ships commanded by Captain John Franklin of Britain's Royal Navy after he set off in 1845 to find a route to Asia through the Northwest Passage? On September 7 the mystery was partially solved when an expedition led by the Canadian government found one of the ships, still relatively intact, resting on the bottom of Queen Maud Gulf in Canada‚Äôs Arctic. Numerous animals can be seen on exhibit at the base, including beluga whales, polar bears, walruses, and harbor seals. There are currently no polar bears at SeaWorld. There are also multiple interactive cameras and activities scattered throughout the station. At the end of the attraction, guests exit through a long series of ramps. =Gift shop= Following this area is a gift shop for the attraction where arctic- themed and SeaWorld-themed merchandise can be purchased.

It is sometimes incorrectly cited in sources as Re: Hydrodam. Facts There were two corporate directors of a parent company of Hydrodan (Corby) Ltd, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Landsaver MCP Ltd, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Midland City Partnerships Ltd, which was, finally, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eagle Trust plc, a TV conglomerate chaired by David James, Baron James of Blackheath. The liquidator alleged that the two directors of Eagle Trust, Leslie Thomas and Dr Hardwick, were liable for wrongful trading, and contended they were liable as shadow directors under the Companies Act 2006 section 251. Judgment Millett J held the directors of the parent were not shadow directors of the subsidiary, just by being members of the parent company‚Äôs board. It would need to be shown that they personally instructed and directed the subsidiary‚Äôs board. The first step is to identify the de jure and de facto directors, then to say that they had been directed, then that the real directors acted in accordance with the directions, and then that they were accustomed to do so. For instance there must be a pattern ‚Äòin which the board did not exercise any discretion or judgment of its own but acted in accordance with the directions of others‚Äô. De facto directors are those who ‚Äòundertook functions in relation to the company which could properly be discharged only by a director.

Early life Auffenberg was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1928. After graduating high school, he relocated to DeLand, Florida to work on two small citrus groves owned by his parents. Shortly after, he enlisted in the US Navy and trained as a Hospital Corpsman in Corpus Christi, Texas. Upon his discharge he returned to Florida and attended Stetson University in DeLand, receiving his Bachelor of Science in Zoology in 1951. He moved to Gainesville, Florida to obtain his advanced degrees at the University of Florida. Academic life Auffenberg received his M.Sc. from the University of Florida in 1953 with his thesis A Study of Geographic Morphological Variation in the Blacksnake. He held a temporary position as Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at The Charleston Museum in 1954 and a Special Student in Paleontology at Harvard University in 1955‚Äì56; obtaining his doctoral degree at the University of Florida in 1956. He wrote his dissertation on the fossil snakes of Florida. In 1959 he and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado to assist his former adviser, Arnold Grobman to start up the innovative and popular high school science program Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS). Missing time in the field, Auffenberg returned to Gainesville, Florida, the University of Florida in 1963 to assume the role of Chairman of the Natural Sciences Department and Curator of Herpetology at the Florida Museum of Natural History (then the Florida State Museum). He remained as chairman until 1971 when he stepped down to concentrate on research. Auffenberg retired as Curator of Herpetology in 1991 and was named Emeritus Distinguished Service Professor/Curator. In 1969, Auffenberg and his family moved to Komodo Island for 11 months where Auffenberg could study the Komodo dragon in its natural habitat. During their stay, Auffenberg, his family and his assistant Putra Sastrawan captured and tagged more than 50 Komodo dragons. The research from the Auffenberg expedition would prove to be influential in the future propagation of Komodo dragons in captivity. Auffenberg authored over 130 books and papers during his lifetime, including his work on the herpetology of Pakistan, which produced one of the world's largest collections of reptiles and amphibians from Pakistan. He is most famous for The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor in 1981, for which he received the Best Wildlife Book Award from The Wildlife Society. Several living and fossil species, including the peacock monitor (Varanus auffenbergi) were named for him.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

Ebert had his basic training in chemistry, physics, and analytical chemistry and natural sciences and served as geologist at the Geological Survey of Prussia. He was obtained his PhD at the University of Leipzig, where he became an associate professor in 1934. He worked on petrography at the Geological Survey of Saxony and developed methods to recognize stratigraphic sequences by petrographic and structural analysis. From 1939 to 1946, World War II interrupted his geological activity. After the war he returned to geology and opened an office for applied geology (groundwater, drilling, economic geology, geology for dams, etc.) He moved to Recife in 1950 and was influential in creating the CAGE (Campaign for Training Geologists). From 1950 to 1956, he was a \\"specialized geologist\\" at the Division of Geology and Mineralogy, which evolved from the old Geological Survey of Brazil, and mapped the regions of S√£o Jo√£o del Rei, Juiz de Fora, and Barbacena, a whole complex metasedimentary southern region of Minas Gerais. He was director of Sudene, training technicians in areas of groundwater in crystalline rocks. In 1962 he moved to Rio Claro, S√£o Paulo, to teach various subjects in the field of geosciences at the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters of the Universidade Estadual Paulista J√∫lio de Mesquita Filho, assisting in the creation of the geology course. He continued his studies with attention to the south and southwest of the state of Minas Gerais. He made several trips abroad, bringing to Brazil contributions of his observations and contacts. He had many students, many of them becoming professors and continuing his work, especially in teaching mineralogy, petrology, structural geology, and the creation and maintenance of the Museum of Minerals and Rocks \\"Heinz Ebert\\".http://www.rc.unesp.br/museudpm/ebert.html (pt) about Dr. Heinz Ebert This museum has a vast collection that Ebert donated, including many didactic collections. Ebert formed in Recife more graduate students. He published around 60 works on geosciences, especially of Brazil. Between 1977 and 1980 he also collaborated with the course of geology at the Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso. In 1974, Ebert won the Jose Bonifacio Gold Medal of the Sociedade Brasileira de Geologia,Heinz Ebert - Jos√© Bonif√°cio Gold Medal, 1974 the highest prize in Brazilian geology.

History  LIVS was first located in Levittown, NY and was previously called ‚ÄúIsland Veterinary Referral.‚Äù Dr. Meyer Kaplan, veterinary surgeon and owner of Levittown Animal Hospital, and Dr. John Sapienza, veterinary ophthalmologist, formed Island Veterinary Referral in 1993. Dr. Dominic J. Marino, veterinary surgeon, and Dr. Rada Panich, veterinary dermatologist, joined Island Veterinary Referral the same year. In June 1998, Island Veterinary Referral changed their name to Long Island Veterinary Specialists. At the time, LIVS was Long Island's first veterinary specialist center with a CT scanner and a fully equipped emergency and critical care center. The Center at LIVS contains an active Neurology/Neurosurgery department and one of the only ‚Äúelectronic brachytherapy‚Äù treatment facility for pet cancer. Among the noteworthy accomplishments of Long Island Veterinary Specialists is their work with canine Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia. The clinicians at Long Island Veterinary Specialists have made advances in the diagnosis and medical management of pets with CM as well as other abnormalities of the craniocervical junction. Some of these advances are made possible using MR imaging to evaluate and the development of a thermal camera-based screening test. Before the introduction of MRI, CM and SM were commonly confused with allergic skin disorders, degenerative disc disease, ear infections and epilepsy. After CM was reported in human patients, the initial research was provided for the diagnosis of animals. On July 13, 2012, Dr. Dominic J. Marino, Chief of Staff at Long Island Veterinary Specialists was featured in a New York Times feature story for hosting and conducting a two-day combat training course for the Air Force Pararescuers from the USAF (United States Air Force)/NYANG (New York Air National Guard), and their service canines. The training session, spanning two days at the LIVS facility consisted of lectures, demonstration labs, and tactical drills to teach pararescuers how to treat canines in crisis situations.

This technique is a synthesis of two metalworking processes; stamping (metalworking) and hydroforming. It is especially suited for the cold forming of tubular structural parts in automotive, railroad and aerospace industries. The process is based on a patent by Stanley Ash from the Greenville Tool & Die Company in Greenville, Michigan. General setup of the liquid impact forming process[1]. Upon closing of the die sections 42 and 44, the liquid inside the tube 30 resists compression and forces the tube walls to conform to the die cavity shape. Process Liquid impact forming uses the principles of hydroforming process with conventional stamping equipment. Even though hydroforming offers great advantages over conventional tube stamping through the reduction of manufacturing steps and the reduction of variation in workpieces, it still requires expensive mechanical equipment such as dies to withstand extreme pressures and pressurizing equipment such as pumps and intensifiers. As an alternative to this, the liquid impact forming utilizes the increase in the internal pressure of the liquid inside of a tube during the stamping process, eliminating the need for the use of above mentioned equipment. The process includes the following stages: 1. A metal tube is filled with a liquid, preferably water and placed between lower and upper die sections of stamping dies. 2. The ends of the liquid-filled tube are sealed to confine the liquid within the tube at approximately atmospheric pressure. 3. The liquid-filled sealed tube is stamped in a conventional die to form the tube into a desired configuration, such as a box-shaped structural member. The compressive forces produced as the die closes to form stamped tube also compress the liquid within the interior of the sealed tube as it changes shape. Thus, the pressure of the liquid increases as the die closes. As the liquid resists compression, it forces the tube walls outwardly toward the interior surface of the die cavity. Once die sections are fully closed around the sealed tube, the tube walls take the shape of the die cavity. 4. The remaining liquid is drained from the formed tube. Applications and Variations The liquid impact forming process is especially advantageous for the cold forming of tubular structural parts in automotive, railroad and aerospace industries. It may be used in the cold forming of cylindrical or non-cylindrical parts. It is limited for the applications requiring extensive metal flow or bulging because of the absence of external pressure utilization as in hydroforming. One further variation of the liquid impact forming comprises the use of a change-of-state material in liquid state in order to prevent the tube wall from buckling or wrinkling during piercing. The change- of-state material can be water or a metallic lead-bismuth alloy. The liquid can be frozen before the stamping phase. After stamping, the liquid can be melted and drained from the shaped tube. Other applications of the process would be the piercing or bulging of tubes, which could also include the use of the change-of-state material.

It was originally serialized in seven parts in the magazine Argosy beginning in November 1933. It was first published in book form in 1961 in hardcover by Avalon Books in 1961; the first paperback edition was issued by Ace Books in the same year. Later trade paperback editions were published by Pulpville Press in November 2007 and Paizo Publishing in May 2009. The novel is a semi- sequel to Kline's earlier Swordsman of Mars, as the setting is the same and the two books have some characters in common. Plot Jerry Morgan, a man with no future on Earth, is offered a new life on Mars. He starts out on the wrong foot, meeting a princess and killing the fearsome-looking Martian beast he takes to be menacing her, which actually turns out to be her pet. From there Morgan becomes entangled in the politics of the Byzantine Martian royal court, spurns the advances of a would-be lover, escapes his hosts and role as an expendable political pawn. Various adventures follow, with dazzling swordplay, feats of strength, and other trials, tribulations and treacheries. Kline's Mars has multiple parallel canals, surrounded by walls and terraces, and the construction of the canals by Martian machines is described.

Pratt to join them.Keith Richardson, \\"\\"New provinces: poems of several authors (1936)\\", Encyclopedia of Literature. JRank.org. Web, March 15, 2011. Scott and Smith disagreed over also inviting Toronto poet Dorothy Livesay. \\"Smith twice explicitly suggested to Scott that Livesay‚Äôs poetry be included in the volume. On both occasions Scott refused, saying that Livesay‚Äôs work would be appropriate for a second, 'more political' edition of New Provinces at a later date.\\" (Scott was a founder of the social democratic Co- operative Commonwealth Federation, while Livesay was a member of the Communist Party of Canada.) Much later, though, Livesay told an interviewer that Scott had wanted to include her work, and that it was Pratt who had vetoed it.Peggy Kelly, \\"Politics, Gender, and New Provinces\\": Dorothy Livesay and F.R. Scott, Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews, No. 53, Fall/Winter, 2003. There were other disagreements between Scott and Smith. \\"Smith wanted the volume to offer an up-to-the minute statement on the contributors' work, while Scott wanted it to offer a more historical statement on the development of the contributors' poetry, in hopes of calling forth other, unknown modernist poets-in-the-making.\\" In line with the anthology he envisioned, Smith penned a Preface in 1934 that was a manifesto of modernism and a rejection of all that had gone before. In Canadian poetry, he mocked, \\"The most popular experience is to be pained, hurt, stabbed or seared by beauty‚Äîpreferably by the yellow flame of a crocus in the spring or the red flame of a maple leaf in the autumn.\\" Leon Edel, \\"A.J.M. Smith Biography\\", Encyclopedia of Literature, JRank.org. Web, March 17, 2011. \\"The fundamental criticism that must be brought against Canadian poetry as a whole,\\" he added, \\"is that it ignores the intelligence. And as a result it is dead.\\" Scott had trouble reconciling that tone with the anthology he planned. \\"You will have to be careful not to make claims for a greater radicalism than this volume will show,‚Äù he warned Smith.W.J. Keith, \\"How New was New Provinces?\\", Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews, No. 4 (Fall/Winter, 1979). Web, March 16, 2011. For his part, Smith objected to the inclusion of the Toronto poets, describing Finch's imagery as \\"trite and undistinguished\\" and some of his lines as \\"distressingly Emily Dickensian,\\" and calling Pratt \\"the weakest member of the group‚Äîjudging of course by his inclusions only.\\" However, Scott held firm on keeping both Pratt and Finch. The final selection was: twelve poems by Smith, eleven by Finch, ten by Kennedy, ten by Scott, eight by Pratt, and two longer poems (\\"Out of the Pulver and the Polished Lens\\" and \\"Soir√©e of Velvel Kleinburger\\" Zailig Pollock, \\"A.

Of the Montreal poets, only Kennedy had previously published a single volume of verse; in contrast, Pratt had been releasing books of poetry for over a decade. \\"Macmillan Canada had published Pratt‚Äôs poetry in the past, and Pratt approached Macmillan‚Äôs literary editor Hugh Eayrs on behalf of the New Provinces group\\" in 1934. One casualty of Pratt's involvement was Smith's Preface. Pratt, who was editor of the Canadian Poetry Magazine, \\"objected to the Preface because its radical pronouncements could alienate half his magazine‚Äôs readers, and Scott wrote to Finch, 'We would not willingly compromise him'.\\" Finch seconded Pratt's objections, prompting Smith to write to Scott: \\"Who the hell are Finch and Pratt to object to the preface? If I am willing to let my poems come out in the same book with Pratt's insipid stuff, he can take the preface.\\" However, Smith's Preface was also \\"rejected by the publisher as being too impatient with traditional Canadian poetry\\", and it was dropped, with Scott writing a more \\"modest\\" Preface instead. When Macmillan also demanded \\"that the poets pay $200 toward the production of 650 to 675 copies of New Provinces, Scott looked elsewhere, and submitted the manuscript to the Dent publishing company. At this point, Pratt threatened to leave the project if Macmillan did not publish it.... In the end, Scott paid the bulk of the cost, $120, while Finch and Pratt each contributed $40. Smith, who could easily afford the fee, refused to contribute because of the argument over his Preface.\\" New Provinces finally was printed in a limited run of 500 copies, of which only 250 were bound for sale, on May 9‚Äì11, 1936.Description, New Provinces: Poems of Several Authors, AbeBooks.com. Web, March 16, 2011. All told, it \\"took 4 years of negotiation and pleading on the part of Scott before it was finally published by the Macmillan Co. of Canada.\\" While the book sold poorly, it had an effect on those who read it. \\"The poems in New Provinces had an impact on Canadian verse far beyond any prefatorial pronouncements: in its implicit call for new findings and new attitudes in Canadian writing, it might be likened to the effect of the Wordsworth- Coleridge Lyrical ballads in 1798 on the Romantics....

Smith's unused Preface (which had been published in 1964 as the \\"Rejected Preface\\") was incorporated into the new work as an \\"important feature.\\" As well, a new introduction was written by editor Michael Gnarowski. =Appraisal= The flyleaf of the 1976 edition called New Provinces \\"a monument in Canadian literature,\\" and in his introduction, Gnarowski described it as \\"a singular event in a literary process which stemmed from the origins of Canadian modernism.\\" Others have made similar claims about its significance: \\"In the Literary History of Canada, Munro Beattie calls New Provinces 'a literary milestone,' and 'a literary signpost' (753,754). More recently, Brian Trehearne describes New Provinces as 'the landmark publication that signalled the demise of the old school of Canadian poetry' (Aestheticism 115).\\" In The Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada, literary critic and anthologist W.H.

New, \\"McGill Movement\\", Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada(Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002), 729. Google Books, Web, Mar. 25, 2011. Later opinions were less praising. The 1997 Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature called the book \\"commercially unsuccessful but critically important,\\" while in 2003 Canadian Poetry published an essay \\"designed to question a literary history which has canonized an unsuccessful volume of poetry published by a small group of Canadian modernists who excluded female poets.\\" Despite poor sales and charges of sexism, though, New Province's place in the modern Canadian canon looks assured. Besides its historical status as the first anthology of modern Canadian poetry, it is also notable for its contributors. Every contributor except for Kennedy (who never published another book) went on to win the Governor General's Award, Canada's top literary honor, for poetry. As only 350 copies of the first edition were ever bound, it is extremely rare. A copy was being offered for sale in 2011 for $750.

He is a critic of the current Syrian government under Bashar al-Assad and has been imprisoned by the Syrian government because he was calling for constitutional reforms. Maleh became an important opposition figure in the Syrian Civil War.  Background  Born in Sarouja, Damascus, Haitham al-Maleh earned a degree in law and a diploma in international law from the Damascus University. He was first arrested in 1951 at the age of twenty when he called for an independent judiciary; he was imprisoned for three weeks. He became a judge in 1958. The first Baathist government dismissed him from the judicial bench because of his public criticism of the 1963 Emergency Law, which suspended constitutional rights and codified martial law. He returned to the practice of law after his dismissal. While originally an advocate for democratic reforms, by the early 1970s, Maleh became an outspoken critic of the situation in Syria. The Syrian government ordered Maleh's arrest and detention numerous times because of his political activities. In 1978. Maleh was jailed as a political prisoner between 1980 and 1986 because he publicly criticized the Syrian government's lack of commitment to repeal the Emergency Law and suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, culminating in the quelling of the group in 1982. He went on hunger strikes at least twice during his detention. Maleh, human rights activists found common ground and started the Human Rights Association in Syria in July 2001, and he was elected president of the organization, a position he held until 2006. He has been active in Amnesty International since 1989. Maleh wrote several times to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad criticizing the human rights violation in the country. Writing as the president of the Syrian Human Rights Association, he demanded the lifting of the Emergency Law. In 2003, he spoke before the German Parliament on the issue of Syrian human rights, describing al-Assad's rule as \\"a fascist dictatorship\\". When he returned, the Syrian government banned him from leaving the country for the next seven years. He has received awards for his defence of human rights in Syria, including the Dutch Human Rights Prize awarded to him in 2006. The Syrian Government refused to allow him to leave the country to receive the award in the Netherlands. After weeks of uncertainty he learned of the final refusal to grant him an exit visa only the day before the ceremony. In 2004 Maleh received the French National Consultative Commission of Human Rights \\"Human Rights Honor Award\\" for his research on torture in Syria, and the annual award for the dignity of the Geneva Human Rights Defenders in 2010, in addition to other awards and honors. 2009 arrest Maleh's most recent arrest was on 14 October 2009, a day after giving an interview on 'Panorama', a political analysis show on Barada TV, a London-based satellite channel associated with the Syrian opposition and allegedly funded by the U.S. government. He was referred to the Damascus military court and tried on charges of spreading false and misleading information that would \\"affect the morale of the nation\\", and sentenced to three years prison. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience, \\"detained solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression\\", and called for his immediate release. He was released on 8 March 2011 after a presidential amnesty on the anniversary of the arrival of the Baath party ascension to power, which was extended only to prisoners over 70 years old. Maleh requested Syrian authorities to cease political detention permanently, release all political prisoners, and affirm the right of every Syrian citizen to express his opinion. He noted that political prisoners are those who voice their opinions, and are not advocates of violence.

The change is always expressed relative to the dimensions before the exposure of washing or relaxing. Shrinkage is also called residual shrinkage and measured in percentage. The major cause of shrinkages is the release of stresses and strains introduced in manufacturing processes. Textile manufacturing is based on the conversion of fiber into yarn, yarn into fabric, includes spinning, weaving, or knitting, etc. The fabric pass through many inevitable changes and mechanical forces during this journey. When the products are immersed in water, the water acts as a relaxing medium, and all stresses and strains get relaxed and try to come back to its original state. The dimensional stability of textile materials is an important quality parameter. Failing and unstable materials can cause deforming of the garments or products. Shrinkage is tested at various stages, but most importantly before cutting the fabric into further sewn products and after cutting and sewing prior to supplying the products to buyers and consumers. It is a required parameter of quality control to ensure the sizes of the products to avoid any complaints regarding deformation or change in dimensions after domestic Laundry. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249785038_Contribution_of_Fabric_Characteristics_and_Laundering_to_Shrinkage_of_Weft_Knitted_FabricsThe tests are conducted with provided specifications of buyers imitating the same conditions like washing cycle time, temperature and water ratio and fabric load and sometimes top loading and front loading washing machines are chosen to authenticate the test and assurance of the results. This procedure provides standard and alternate home laundering conditions using an automatic washing machine. While the procedure includes several options, it is not possible to include every existing combination of laundering parameters. The test is applicable to all fabrics and end products suitable for home laundering.  Types of shrinkage  Shrinkage is a change in dimensions across the length and width of the fabric after washing, usage, and when exposed to the relaxing of fabrics. Mainly shrinkage is of two types one is minus shrinkage and the other is plus shrinkage. Skew (twisting of the vertical grains) is also observed along with shrinkage. Abnormal twisting is also considered as a non- conformity. # Contraction: Any noticeable decrease in dimensions is known as Contraction(minus) shrinkage. # Expansion: Any noticeable increase or expansion in dimension is known as Expansion (plus) shrinkage. Causes * Composition and properties Composition and content determine the type and percentage of fibres. Natural fibres shrink more than synthetic fibres. Synthetic fibres are more stable due to their crystalline and thermoplastic nature. They do not shrink, whereas natural fibres are more prone to shrink because of more amorphous regions in their fibre structure which allows more absorption of water, swelling of fibres and increased lubricity increase the shrinking tendency. Blended fabrics normally synthetic and natural are also considered more stable. * Structure of the fabric/ knit or weave, loose and tight structure The textile products which are loosely woven or knitted are prone to shrink more and tightly knitted and woven products are more stable. In knitted fabrics the structure is competitively loose and flexible. Knitting structures are constructed by interlocking the loops. Whereas in weaving yarns are interlaced at right angles to form a stable fabric. * Finishing applications and procedures Fibers to fabric conversion lead to many mechanical tensions and forces during manufacturing, which includes following steps for fibre to yarn conversion with spinning then fabric with weaving, and knitting. When the products are immersed in water, the water acts as a relaxing medium and all stresses and strains get relaxed and try to come back to its original relaxed state. Even after finishing with sophisticated finishing machines, some residual shrinkage remains, which is carried forward to the garment stage. This residual shrinkage may cause deformity or de- shaping of the products after domestic laundry. There are certain acceptance limits of shrinkage levels for every product. Abnormal shrinkage levels are considered a non-conformity to quality standards.https://www.cottoninc.com/wp- content/uploads/2017/12/ISP-1009-Guide-to-Improved-Shrinkage-Performance-of- Cotton-Fabrics.pdf  Test methods  The different test methods are used as per the final destination of the product (Europe, U.S.A., etc) and the expected washing or laundry methods in practice. Mainly I.S.O. and AATCC standards are used for shrinkage testing. There are few brands which are customizing the test method as per their quality norms. Test Method(s): Shrinkage measuring template, scale and marker * AATCC Test Method 135 * AATCC Test Method 150 * ISO 6330 * CAN/CGSB 58 AATCC Test Method 135, dimensional change of fabrics after home laundering Scope: determines the dimensional changes of garments when subjected to home laundering procedures used by consumers. The method is for fabric not yet made into a garment. A sample is marked with benchmarks before home laundering. Then it is laundered 3 times total, then the benchmarks are measured again. Before and after laundering benchmarks are compared. AATCC Test Method 150, Dimensional Change of Fabrics After Home Laundering Scope: Determines the dimensional changes of garments when subjected to home laundering procedures used by consumers.  Importance  Shrinkage has great significance because any expansion or shrinkage can cause deformation of the product, which could be a severe concern for the end- user, and the brand can lose its reputation. Secondly, in the garment-making industry, consumption of the fabric is calculated in yards, so any variance than permissible limits is unacceptable. Preshrunk fabrics and garments are also available. Shrinkage controlling methods There are various physical and chemical methods to minimize the residual shrinkage of the fabrics. * It starts with the right selection of yarn count or denier to achieve particular g.s.m(Grams per square meters) * Appropriate loop or weaves density/tightness factor of loops (which is called loop length. Chemical treatments like mercerizing of cotton, * Resinationhttps://thebusinesstactics.com/519691/global-urea-formaldehyde- resin-market-2025-company-and-financial-overview-product-portfolio-business- strategies-and-recent-developments/ of cotton in case of woven materials. * Heat setting, Pre-heat-setting and post-heat setting of synthetic and blended fabrics Heat setting is a thermal process taking place mostly in either a steam atmosphere or a dry heat environment. The effect of the process gives fibers, yarns or fabric dimensional stability). * Finishing on machines like sanphorizing Mechanical shrinking (sometimes referred to as sanforizing), whereby the fabric is forced to shrink width and/or lengthwise, creates a fabric in which any residual tendency to shrink after subsequent laundering is minimal compacting machines. * For wool garments, shrinkage is due to scales on the fibers which heat, water, and agitation cause to stick together. Other fabrics are stretched by mechanical forces during production and can shrink slightly when heated (though to a lesser degree than wool). * Some clothes are shrunk in the factory to avoid this problem. * Wash care label is like a manual of the garment, customers should refer the wash care instructions before putting their clothes in washing. The wash care label infers about handling the garment such as washing, drying (tumble or line dry), and ironing. Sometimes expensive and sensitive clothes may require dry clean to avoid shrinkage and any kind of distortions.https://web.archive.org/web/20130528201142/http://www.sartex.ch/en/textilkennzeichnung/pflegekennzeichnung/pflegesymbole/textilpflege/ See also * List of laundry topics * https://sciencetrends.com/science- behind-clothes-shrink-polyester-viscose-cotton References Laundry Fibers ","title":"Dimensional stability (fabric)"},{"id":"31205399","text":"Dead Fish is a 2008 English-language German action comedy film starring Robert Carlyle, Gary Oldman, Andrew-Lee Potts and Elena Anaya.

It is the successor to NCAA Football 11 in the NCAA Football series. It was released on July 12, 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Gameplay A new momentum-based tackling system has been introduced, including double-hit tackles and an overall increase in the number of tackle animations. A coach mode has also been added, where players can call plays, and make pre-play adjustments as well as watch them unfold, through a broadcast-style camera. Field grass is now rendered in 3-D for instant replays. In addition, various aspects of the game have added sponsorship picked up from SPARQ, Allstate, Coca-Cola Zero, Nissan, and Lowe's. For Dynasty Mode, changes include a new coaching carousel where players can start as offensive or defensive coordinators and change jobs or get promoted after each season; at the same time, AI coaches will also switch positions or get fired. Crowds will be louder or quieter based on the player's team's success, and how big the stadium is. The ability to create custom conferences has been added; previous versions only allowed one-to-one swaps of teams between conferences; conference membership can also be changed from year to year. Bowl tie-ins can be changed, although there is still no end-of-season playoff option due to licensing with the BCS. Road to Glory, a game mode in which a player takes control of a prospective collegiate athlete and must practice, study, and play at the level needed to win the Heisman Trophy, has been expanded to include an entire high school senior season (past versions of the game only included high school playoffs) and a points and rewards system to increase ratings. You can use teambuilder teams as your high school opponents. Support has been added for two-way players. Once in college, student-athletes can only advance on their team's depth chart (or call their own plays or audibles if a quarterback) when they have earned enough \\"trust points\\" from their coach. However, major drawbacks of Road to Glory includes: * While an offensive RTG player (QB, TE, WR, etc.) can break away from his assignments and run his own routes, a defensive RTG player is always restricted to his assignments and even controller inputs cannot make him break away from his assignments until contact with opposite O-Line. * It is now impossible for a defensive RTG player to win the Heisman Trophy under any circumstances. The demo, released on June 28 on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, features two matchups representing four conferences. One has the reigning Pac-10 champion Oregon Ducks visiting the Texas Longhorns of the Big 12. The second has the ACC's Atlantic Champion Florida State Seminoles hosting the Alabama Crimson Tide of the Southeastern Conference. Additionally, players can share the demo through Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network to unlock the alternate Pro Combat uniforms of five squads for use in the full game. Cover On April 19, 2011, it was announced that former Alabama running back and 2009 Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram Jr. would be the cover athlete for the game. Ingram won a fan vote organized by EA Sports to determine who the cover athlete would be in a campaign using the slogan \\"U Want Me\\". Ingram beat out Auburn's Nick Fairley, Oklahoma's DeMarco Murray, and Washington's Jake Locker. Votes were taken through the game's Facebook page. Alternate covers (Nick Fairley, DeMarco Murray, Jake Locker) were made available for download on the NCAA Football 12 website. Commentary The announcers remain the same from NCAA Football 11 with Kirk Herbstreit and Brad Nessler in the announcer booth along with Erin Andrews on the sideline. For the first time, Lee Corso was not involved in the game as only Herbstreit predicts the winner of the matchup. However, not all Corso commentary was deleted in the PS3 version. Reception The game was rated 8.5/10 and called \\"great\\" by IGN. Another reviewer called the game \\"practically perfect\\". Reception from players who purchased the game was not quite so favorable, with some gamers criticizing the lack of innovation from previous installments, as well as linebackers who jump unrealistically high.

Starting in 1935 he worked with the Cyrulik Warszawski and Ma≈Çe Qui pro Quo theaters. Some of his hits included: * Um√≥wi≈Çem siƒô z niƒÖ na dziewiƒÖtƒÖ (I Have a Date with Her at Nine), music by Henryk Wars, * Sex-appeal, music by Henryk Wars, * Nie ja‚Äînie ty!

He was known for his anti-Nazi satires. However, after the Germans occupied Lw√≥w in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa, Schlechter was sent to the Lviv ghetto. He was then transferred to the Janowska concentration camp where he was part of its artistic life, participating in literary evenings. Schlechter most likely died in Janowska in 1942, along with his wife and young son, although it is possible that he managed to survive until 1943.

His wife died in 1910 and they do not appear to have had any children. Career Following his university degree, Purchase took further law examinations and in 1913 he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple.The Times House of Commons, 1919; Politico‚Äôs Publishing, 2004 p20 He then joined the Northern Circuit, localised at Liverpool and later acquired the degree of Doctor of Law from London University. During the Great War Purchase performed various public tasks. In 1915, he was sent on a special mission to France for the purpose of organising a British and American hospital at Neuilly. In 1917 he took a post in the enforcement branch of the Ministry of Food in London and was shortly afterwards made an assistant director of the Ministry. Politics = 1918 = Sir Stephen Collins, the Liberal MP for Kennington in Lambeth since 1906 decided not to contest the seat at the 1918 general election, perhaps because at the age of 71 he felt it was time to stand down. This left a vacancy and Purchase was selected to fight the seat for the Liberals. Purchase stood as a supporter of the Coalition government of David Lloyd George. Purchase had the advantage of the Coalition couponhttps://doi.org/10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.013.112246 over the Unionist, Colonel Francis Alfred Lucas, the former MP for Lowestoft who had fought the seat in the general elections of January and December 1910. However Lucas died before polling day, invalidating the pollThe Times, 12 December 1918 p6 and the election in Kennington had to be run as a separate event about a fortnight after all other polling on 20 December 1918.The Times, 13 December 1918 p10 Purchase faced two opponents, for the Unionists, Alice Theresa Lucas who as hospital chairperson and the widow of Col. Lucas was chosen thus giving the Conservative Party its first woman candidate in a Parliamentary election.Pamela Brookes, Women at Westminster; Peter Davies, London, 1967 p12 Mr William Glennie fought the seat for the Labour Party.The Times, 17 December 1918 p10 Purchase had the ‚Äòcoupon‚Äô and he had a telegram of support from Lloyd George.The Times, 18 December 1918 p5 Despite the novelty of Mrs Lucas‚Äô candidacy, the election seems to have been a lacklustre affair. The Times newspaper reported on polling day that ‚Äò....very little interest is being taken in the contest and a visitor to the constituency would have difficulty in knowing that an election is in progress.‚Äô Purchase held the seat for the Liberals and the Coalition with a majority of 1,132 votes and 42% of the poll, Mrs Lucas polled 32% and Glennie came third with 25%.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p34 Although this was a good majority compared with the 55 votes by which Sir Stephen Collins had defeated Colonel Lucas in December 1910, it was perhaps closer than some commentators anticipated, given the landslide for the Coalition which had taken place overall. One historian has written of Mrs Lucas‚Äô result that she was ‚Äòprobably the first woman to discover that there is nothing like bereavement, injury or childbirth to commend a candidate to the British electorate.‚ÄôPamela Brookes, Women at Westminster; Peter Davies, London, 1967 p14 = Government office = Following his attachment as Assistant Director to the Ministry of Food in 1918,Times House of Commons 1929, Politico‚Äôs Publishing 2003, p46 in its Enforcement Branch, Purchase was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chairman of the National Insurance Joint Committee in 1919. He also served as Hon.

In a reversal of fortune from 1918, Purchase found himself at the bottom of the poll with just 16.6% of the votes cast. The seat was won for the Tories by Francis Capel Harrison with a majority of 2,411 votes. Purchase made regular attempts to get back into the House of Commons.

In November 1899, the former Liberal prime minister, Lord Rosebery was the leading speaker at a commemorative meeting which raised money for the Prince of Wales's Hospital Fund.The Times, 27 November 1899 p11 The following year Purchase became an Assistant Secretary of the New Reform Club, a club founded in 1900 as a social rallying point for what was then called ‚Äòadvanced Liberal organisations‚Äô (that is those supporting radical policies such as those embodied in the Newcastle Programme), although it harked back to more traditional Liberal approaches in its desire to bring about ‚Äòpeace, retrenchment and reform‚Äô in the footsteps of the plans for the original Reform Club. Robert Reid MP was the Club's first president.The Times, 22 March 1900 p6 Purchase operated as Secretary from the Club's premises in St Ermine's Mansions in Westminster.

They formed in late 2004 and released their official debut album Modern Bodies on 1 November 2010 through Brew Records.  History  =Early years (2004‚Äì2010)= The band played a part in the Leeds underground DIY metal and hardcore scene, amongst the local squats and dives. Some small CD splits and self-released CD-r's appeared during this time, all recorded with Ross Halden in his home basement studio Ghost Town Studios. Following years of house shows, small releases and self- organised tours, Brew Records picked up on the band and included them on their first release in 2007, a compilation entitled Volume 1 featuring other local bands part of the same DIY scene. This was to become a much stronger relationship as time passed. The band next decided to make an album of all the material they had to date and recorded it in sessions between Chris Fielding at Foel Studio in Wales and Jason Sanderson in Barnsley. Nottingham based label Sound Devastation released the self-titled debut on a limited run in 2008 and soon after Reid joined the band to complete the line-up and continue touring. The album and compilation both received great praise from the press. In mid-2008, the band decided to film their first music video for the track 'NASA Vs ESA' (taken from the self-titled debut) and shortly after its release local Leeds label Brew Records, offered to add Hawk Eyes to their growing roster (I Concur, Kong, These Monsters, Castrovalva). They saw the year out with further touring and writing. In March 2009, they returned to Jason Sanderson's studio to record their first material with latest member Reid. An EP entitled A. Or Not? (named after a close friend/promoter), and in support of the EP's release, they produced their second video for the track \\"I Hate This, Do You Like It?\\" in collaboration with the NME/SPIN magazine photographer Danny North. The EP was released in the late summer of 2009 following Hawk Eyes' first festival appearance on the BBC Introducing stage at the Leeds and Reading festivals and a UK tour with label mates Kong. At this point another Leeds independent label Dance To The Radio, asked the band to contribute a track towards their '4 X 12' series'. The track used was called Scorpieau - recorded by old friend Ross Halden at his newly located penthouse Ghost Town Studios mark II. Both the EP and the 12\\" split received positive national recognition. They closed the year off with their largest tour to date supporting US outfit The Fall of Troy across the UK. Hawk Eyes started the year 2010 touring with The Computers and Outcry Collective, and were invited by Mike Davies to record at BBC's Maida Vale Studio in London for the Radio 1 punk rock show during the tour. The band played over 10 festivals across the country including Leeds & Reading, Hevy Festival and Sonisphere. Brew then released Modern Bodies, a selection of songs taken from previous limited releases, collected together on one new album. Remixed By Kevin Vanbergen, remastered and featuring brand new artwork by Reid and North. The album received critical acclaim worldwide. A UK tour supporting We Are The Ocean and a UK/European tour supporting Alexisonfire followed with positive reviews. =2011‚Äìpresent= Between January and October the band recorded the follow up releases, Mindhammers and Ideas. During November Hawk Eyes toured the UK with Turbowolf and The JCQ. In December, Hawk Eyes toured as main support for Ginger Wildheart. On 12 December, Hawk Eyes released Mindhammers, a 5 track EP available by download and on limited 10\\" vinyl. Hawk Eyes released Ideas on 21 March 2012 through Vinyl Junkie in Japan and 26 March 2012 on Fierce Panda in the UK. It was revealed that their drummer Matt Reid had left the band and that Steve Wilson, the former drummer of Japanese Voyeurs and Dinosaur Pile- Up, had joined the band. During 2012 Hawk Eyes toured extensively throughout the UK, Europe and Japan. Ideas received high praise from the rock press including 5Ks in Kerrang, being nominated for Best Newcomer at 2012's Kerrang awards. Whilst still touring, Hawk Eyes released a new EP in 2013 titled That's What This Is via Pledgemusic. The band also commenced writing & recording a new album. In 2014, the band continued to record their third album with producer Andy Hawkins. The new album 'Everything is Fine' will be released in February 2015, pre sale being announced in October 2014.

Avalon was an important science fiction imprint in the 1950s and 60s; later its specialty was mystery and romance books. The imprint was owned by Thomas Bouregy & Co., Inc.. It remained a family firm, with Thomas's daughter Ellen Bouregy Mickelsen taking over as publisher in 1995. On June 4, 2012 it was announced that Amazon.com had purchased the imprint and its back-list of about 3,000 titles. Amazon said it would publish the books through the various imprints of Amazon Publishing. Science fiction era In the 1950s and 60s Avalon specialized in science fiction.AvalonBooks at ISFDB It issued much of the hardcover material in the genre during the period, particularly in the earlier portion. Avalon issued new titles, reissued out of print titles originally from other publishers, and first editions of material that had previously only seen magazine publication. Frederik Pohl jibed in 1959 that the publisher \\"seems to be pursuing a policy of printing the worst books by the best writers in science fiction\\".\\"In the Balance\\", If, July 1959, p.99 Its books featured cover art by Ric Binkley, Ed Emshwiller (also known as Emsh), Gray Morrow, and Michael M.

Benavides earned himself the sobriquet of the Paul Revere of Texas for his 1836 journey from San Patricio to Goliad to Victoria, warning residents of the approaching Mexican army. He was twice elected alcalde of Victoria, Texas. He married into the powerful De Le√≥n family, and with his wife Agustina became the father of three daughters. Benavides fought against the dictatorship of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, but did not feel Texas should be separated from Mexico. He led a unit of Tejano fighters at the Battle of Goliad ,and then he proceeded with his company to San Antonio, where they fought against Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos in the Siege of Bexar. On February 11, 1836, Benavides sent a warning to James Bowie inside the Alamo that Santa Anna was approaching. Benavides escaped the Battle of Agua Dulce and was able to warn James Fannin headquartered in Goliad of the enemy army's approach, as he had warned all towns between Agua Dulce and Goliad. When the Texas Declaration of Independence was signed on March 2, 1836, James Fannin discharged Benavides from the army and sent him home. On his route back to Victoria, Benavides spread the alarm about the march of the Mexican army. In 1836, Benavides and his family were among the Mexicans evacuated out of Victoria by Brigadier General Thomas Jefferson Rusk. His family exiled to Louisiana, where he died of an unknown cause the next year. Texas Historical Marker number 6563 placed in 1936 at the SW Corner of S. Main and Juan Linn in Victoria, marks the site of the Benavides Round Top house. Early life Pl√°cido Benavides was born in 1810, in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico.Hardin, del la Teja (2010) p.58 Details of his youth are unknown, except that he was taken under the wing of his godfather Captain Henrique Villareal. In 1828, Benavides moved to Victoria, Texas with his brothers Ysidro, Nicol√°s and Eugenio.Hardin, del la Teja (2010) p.57 He became secretary to Fernando De Le√≥n, the eldest son of the influential De Le√≥n family in Victoria County. There, Benavides was put in the position of overseeing land titles and general business transactions. He married into the De Leon family in 1831. The Mexican government authorized Benavides to continue recruiting colonists to De Leon's Colony after the 1833 death of empresario Mart√≠n De Le√≥n. In 1832 and 1834, Benavides was elected second alcalde of Victoria. Mart√≠n De Le√≥n had held the position as the first alcalde, and Silvestre De Le√≥n served as the third alcalde. Benavides built a house fortress with first-floor gun slits and reinforced door, that became known alternately as \\"Pl√°cido's Round House\\" and the \\"Round Top House\\". Benavides and his brother-in-law Silvestre De Le√≥n, led several attacks against the Tonkawa and Karankawa Indian tribes.Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.59 After the death of Benavides, many lives were saved in 1840 by hiding in the round house during a raid by 600 Comanches.Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.59, 70, 71 Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 6563 placed in 1936 at the SW Corner of S. Main and Juan Linn in Victoria, marks the site of the Benavides Round Top house. At war with Santa Anna When Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna became President of Mexico on April 1, 1833, he revoked the 1824 Constitution of Mexico and replaced its Federalist form of government with a Centralist regime to further his military dictatorship. He appointed his brother-in-law Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos as commandant-general northeast of Saltillo. Some in the De Leon extended family felt loyal to the Federalist government of the constitution.Chance (2006) p.28 =Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal= On April 28, 1835, federal legislation in Mexico invalidated the Four Hundred League Law that had been passed by the Coahuila y Texas legislature.Chance (2006) p.32 Benavides' brother-in-law Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal was an elected representative from Bexar to that legislature.Chance (2006) p.30 General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos sent troops to shut down the legislature, and ordered the arrest of all who voted for the Four Hundred League Law. Colonel Domingo Ugartechea, as principal commandant of Coahuila y Texas, ordered Cabajal arrested, but soldiers searching for him in Victoria were unsuccessful in their attempts at doing so. Alcalde BenavidesChance (2006) p.35 had refused to surrender Carbajal, and ordered his local militia to block the soldiers from entry into Victoria.Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.57, 58 =La Bahia= After Gonzales, Texas repelled the Mexican attempted seizure of their cannon on October 2, 1835, Benavides teamed up with John Joseph Linn to capture General Cos. In Victoria, they joined with George M. Collinsworth and Benjamin Milam who were training men for the same purpose. During the Battle of Goliad, Benavides was put in charge of thirty Tejano volunteers, who were part of the October 1835 storming of Presidio La Bah√≠a.Hardin, del la Teja (2010) p.61 Goliad was captured by Collinsworth and Milam on October 9, 1835. =James Bowie= Following the capture of Goliad, Benavides and his men were ordered to join Stephen F. Austin in the two-month Siege of B√©xar campaign to drive out General Cos. As part of the campaign, Benavides and his men joined with the James Bowie group in October 1835. In the process of searching for enemy horses, Benavides suggested to Bowie that they torture a simple Mexican herder into admitting he was hiding horses for the Mexican soldiers. The particular torture method used by Benavides and Bowie was to hang the herder by the neck until he almost choked to death, then let him down and threaten him with guns. After executing this method of torture three successive times on the man, the herder confessed and surrendered his herd to Bowie.Hardin, del la Teja (2010) p.62 =Matamoros jail break= Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal, his brother-in-law Fernando De Le√≥n, and Peter Kerr, responded to an arms plea from Stephen F. Austin and began to run horses and mules to New Orleans in a trade for munitions. The trio were captured by Mexicans and taken prisoner.Chance (2006) p.38 Kerr was set free, and Fernando De Le√≥n bribed his way out. Carbajal was transferred to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, with an intended transfer for imprisonment at San Juan de Ulloa. In February 1836, Pl√°cido Benavides was serving at San Patricio under Major Robert C. Morris. When word arrived of Carbajal's imprisonment, Benavides took a small group of men to break Carbajal out of incarceration. He bribed the guards at Matamoros. Although Mexicans gave pursuit, the escape back to Victoria was a success.Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.63, 64 =Goliad= The alcalde of Matamoros had leaked to Benavides that Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna planned to draw the Texas forces below the Rio Grande. Benavides reported the information to Major Morris, who in turn passed it along to James Fannin. Upon receipt of the information, Fannin decided against his planned invasion of Matamoros and instead moved his men to Goliad.Hardin, del la Teja (2010) p.64 =Alamo= Inside the Alamo Mission in San Antonio, at 1 a.m. on February 11, 1836, messenger Blas Mar√≠a Herrera delivered to James Bowie a letter from Benavides, that stated Santa Anna was moving towards San Antonio with a large deployment of troops. =Texas Paul Revere= On February 27, 1836, while Benavides and James Grant were out with a detachment hunting wild mustangs, General Jos√© de Urrea captured San Patricio. On March 2, 1836, Benavides and Grant stumbled into a trap set by Urrera at Agua Dulce Creek, south of San Patricio. Benavides tried to rejoin the men but was ordered by Grant to save himself and warn Fannin of Urrea's approach. Upon reaching Fannin with the warning, and learning that the Texas Declaration of Independence had just been signed at Washington-on-the-Brazos, Benavides informed Fannin that he did not wish to help Texas to be torn from Mexico. Fannin discharged Benavides from the army and sent him home to Victoria.Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.64, 65, 66 From San Patricio to his final destination of Victoria, Benavides warned every person and town along the way of Urrea's approach. Benavides became known as the Paul Revere of Texas.MacDonald (2009) p.187 =Isaac D. Hamilton= On March 27, 1836, following the Battle of Coleto, Mexican soldiers under General Jos√© de Urrea gunned down 342 unarmed Texans. Isaac D. Hamilton, who had served with Benavides at Goliad, escaped and found refuge on a ranch owned by Benavides. Upon finding the wounded Hamilton, Benavides attempted to take Hamilton to safety. Encountering a Mexican unit, Benavides saved himself by claiming Hamilton was his prisoner. Hamilton was tortured and taken to Victoria to face a firing squad. He was rescued by \\"The Angel of Goliad\\", Francisca Alvarez. With the help of Alvarez, Hamilton escaped back to his hometown of Courtland, Alabama. Hamilton returned to Texas, and in 1858 the Texas legislature awarded him a bounty certificate for league of land, as part of the state's bounty grants for participants in the battle of the Alamo, the siege of Bexar, the Goliad campaigns. Hamilton died in 1859 before he was able to take possession of the land.Hardin, del la Teja (2010) pp.66, 67 Exile to Louisiana During the Texas War of Independence many Mexicans were opposed to Santa Anna's regime, but felt loyal to Mexico and its 1824 constitution.Chance (2006) p.42 Brigadier General Thomas Jefferson Rusk ordered the evacuation of Mexican families \\"...who were likely to afford information to the enemy.\\" The Carbajal, Benavides and De Leon families evacuated to New Orleans, leaving behind their wealth and everything they owned.Chance (2006) p.43 Personal life and death In 1831 Benavides married Agustina De Le√≥n, daughter of empresario Mart√≠n De Le√≥n and his wife Patricia de la Garza De Le√≥n. The couple had three daughters, Pilar, Librada and Matiana. Benavides died in Opelousas, Louisiana in 1837, cause unknown.

History  The current club was the result of the merger of several smaller Italian sports clubs in San Francisco. The first club formed in 1917 and was called Circolo Ricreativo Italiano Virtus. In 1919 a second club emerged called Unione Sportiva Italiana. Shortly thereafter Sporting Club Italia began in 1920. The following year SC Italia joined with Virtus becoming Italia Virtus Club. In 1926 they merged with Unione to become the largest Italian sports club in the country as Unione Sportiva Italiana Virtus. By 1936 the current building of the club had been completed at which point they became known as Italian Athletic Club. Negative sentiment during the World War II period led to the club dropping 'Italian' from their name and continued as simply San Francisco Athletic Club until 1979 when 'Italian' was once again part of their name.  Athletics  The club has participated in numerous sporting activities including baseball, basketball cycling, fencing, gymnastics, running, and soccer. Their Statuto Race is among the oldest annual foot races in the country having started back in 1919 to commemorate Italy's first constitution as a cohesive nation. One of the club's highest achievements was accomplished by their soccer team when they won the 1976 National Challenge Cup Steve Negoesco, of USF fame, was the coach of the champion soccer team. Other notable people from the SFIAC club are Ray Piva (runner), Steve Landi (power lifter), Gino Cimoli (baseball), and Steve Mariucci (football). In 2016, SFIAC's Men's Soccer Team was promoted to the SFSFL Premier Division, which returns the team to the top local semi- professional level within the San Francisco Bay Area. SFIAC's soccer team still competes in the SFSFL Premier Division to this day.  Sources  *Pierucci, Gianrico Claudio. The Heart of North Beach.

Assistive Media: Expanding the world of reading. Assistive Media was founded in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1996 by David Erdody as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. According to Erdody, it was inspired by his father's diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, an avid reader of The New Yorker magazine and audiobooks. He considers Duvall Hecht's Books on Tape (company) and the narration style of Grover Gardner to have had a major influence on his admiration for the audiobook format . Utilizing volunteer readers and work-study students from the University of Michigan, Assistive Media began producing and distributing spoken-word recordings of otherwise inaccessible materials on audio cassette to The Washtenaw County, Michigan Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled, a participating library of the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped of the Library of Congress. In 1998, with the advent of online digital audio formats such as RealAudio, direct distribution of recordings shifted to the Assistive Media website and has received praise from the at- large online disabled community and also from David McCullough, Mark Cuban, and John Perry Barlow. In 1999, Assistive Media was awarded RealNetworks, Inc.'s Progressive Streamers Award as the best nonprofit streaming web site of the year over Peter Gabriel's Witness (organization). Assistive Media has produced spoken-word recordings of works of nonfiction literature and long- form journalism from The Atlantic, Granta, Harper's Magazine, The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, Scientific American, and Wired. It is considered one of the longest continuously running Internet-based nonprofit services. In 2011, Assistive Media began recording unabridged full-length books of biographical, historical, and contemporary nonfiction for online delivery to libraries that specialize in books for the blind .

Before she became a full-time writer she used to work as a conflict advisor for EU and UNO, mostly in Africa. Literature Janne Teller's literature, consisting of mainly novels and essays, but also short stories ‚Äì as well as various works for young adults ‚Äì always focuses on larger existential perspectives of life and human civilization and often sparks controversial and heated debates. She has received many literary awards, and her work is translated over 25 languages. Janne Teller's novels cover a wide variety of contemporary and philosophical issues. They include the highly praised modern Nordic saga Odin's Island (1999), dealing with religious and political fanaticism; Europa (2004), about European identity and the binds of history in love and war; and Come (2008), about ethics in art and modern life. Her essays cover existential and ethical perspectives of modern life, and include 'Between the Lines' (Lettre International, 2012), \\"Europe, who do you want to be?\\" (Die Welt, 2012) and 'Little Brother is watching you' (Cicero, 2010). She's furthermore thought to have revolutionized the young adult novel with her existential Nothing (Danish Intet), first published in Denmark in 2000, earned critical acclaim and caused widespread controversy in Scandinavia. It was initially banned, but has since risen as an international bestseller and is today considered a neo-classic by numerous critics worldwide. The novel's main character, the boy Pierre Anthon, proclaims to his classmates that life is meaningless, sitting in a plum tree. They feel an urge to show Pierre Anthon some proof that there is meaning in life, which ultimately leads to violence amongst the children. A German as well as an English translation of Intet were published in 2010. The novel received several awards, among them a Michael L. Printz Honor Book for the English edition in 2011 and the Danish Ministry of Culture's children book prize (Denmark) (Kulturministeriets B√∏rnebogspris) in 2001 for the Danish edition. Her fictional essay War (2004), published in the shape of a passport on life as a refugee, has also generated widespread debate, particularly in Europe. Janne Teller published her first short story in the Danish Daily, Berlingske Tidende, at the age of 14. Petition against mass surveillance In December 2013, Teller helped organise a petition of 560 world-renowned contemporary authors, protesting against mass surveillance in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations. Several Nobel laureates were signatories to the open appeal to governments, corporations and the United Nations Background Originally educated as a macro economist, Janne Teller worked for the United Nations and the European Union in conflict resolution and humanitarian issues around the World, particularly in Africa. She devoted herself full-time to fiction writing in 1995. For several years, she was a member of the Board of the Danish Fiction Writers‚Äô Association and of Danish PEN, as well as of the Editorial Board of the Danish version of the intellectual magazine, Lettre International. She has lived in a wide variety of places from Brussels, Paris, Milan, to Dar es Salaam and Maputo. Presently, she resides in New York City.
