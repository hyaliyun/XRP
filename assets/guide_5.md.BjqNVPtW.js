The mountain's rock is granodiorite that was formed during the Callovian. The second oldest rock is a mixture of Late Jurassic chert and limestone known as the Tateishi Formation. The Tateishi Formation can be seen along the peninsula's east coast. These two formations make up the basement rock of the peninsula. The next layers of rock seen on the peninsula formed during the Miocene. These layers include andesite, tuff breccia, and a system of sills and dikes left over from an extinct volcano that was centered at Mount Sasamori, a foothill of Mount Mizugasawa.

Under the provisions of the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1890, the West Virginia Legislature established the West Virginia Colored Institute for the education of African Americans in 1891. The institute opened at Piney Grove in 1892, and the town's name was changed to Institute. In 1949 the West Virginia Conservation Commission, Division of State Parks, opened Booker T. Washington State Park, which was named for African American educator and West Virginia native Booker T. Washington. Following the park's integration in 1954, it remained open as a day-use picnic area until the late 1950s. By 1959 Booker T. Washington State Park was no longer listed in that year's West Virginia Blue Book listing of state parks.  Geography and setting  Booker T. Washington State Park was just outside the unincorporated community of Institute, Kanawha County, West Virginia, approximately east of the West Virginia State College (now University) campus. The Shawnee Reservation Mound, a Late Adena Native American mound within present-day Shawnee Regional Park in Institute, is located southwest of the former park site. The park was situated on at an elevation of on the northern edge of the Kanawha River valley. It was bound by forested hills to its west and east, the confluence of Finney Branch and an unnamed stream in a hollow to its north, and the northern end of Pinewood Drive to its south. Finney Branch is a tributary stream of the Kanawha River, which flows southwest of the park's location. Dutch Hollow, formed by a Finney Branch tributary, is approximately east of the park's location and is the site of the Dutch Hollow Wine Cellars, presently located within Dunbar's Wine Cellar Park. The former park land is covered in secondary forest consisting of tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), several species of oak (Quercus), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), several species of pine (Pinus), and other deciduous species.  Background  = Area history = The section of the Kanawha River valley between present-day Charleston and St. Albans was once the site of a dense concentration of Late Adena Native American mounds and earthworks, including Institute's Shawnee Reservation Mound. The Shawnee Reservation Mound is one of only three mounds that remain from this original complex of mounds and earthworks. This region of the Kanawha River valley was granted to George Washington, recently returned from fighting in the French and Indian War, following Virginia Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie's Proclamation of 1754. The Proclamation of 1754 encouraged enlistment for the Monongahela expedition in exchange for a reward of land from a reservation in western Virginia. Between 1772 and 1774, Washington claimed four large land tracts in the Kanawha River valley totaling . Washington leased the four tracts to James Welch in 1797, and following Welch's death the tracts reverted to Washington's estate. These tracts were divided and sold into the 19th century by Washington's heirs. Wine Cellar Park in Dutch Hollow In Dutch Hollow, to the east of the Cabell property and the state park land, a vineyard and the Dutch Hollow Wine Cellars were established by Tom Friend around 1860 and operated for about three years. The area's wine industry shuttered following the American Civil War possibly due to high labor costs, unreliable grape crops, and competition from out-of-state wineries. In 1853 Samuel I. Cabell purchased encompassing the Kanawha River valley bottomlands between Sattes and the western area of present-day Dunbar. Cabell, his wife Mary Barnes Cabell (a freedwoman), their family, and their slaves relocated to this property where Cabell operated a plantation. In 1870 the Kanawha County Commissioners divided the former Cabell plantation land tract among his widow and his children, providing each with a strip of land extending between the hills to the north (where the park would later be located) and the Kanawha River bank to the south. The present-day community of Institute is situated on land that was once part of Cabell's plantation. Cabell's descendants and his former slaves remained in the vicinity of his plantation and settled a community known variously as Cabell Farm and Piney Grove. A post office opened at Piney Grove in 1876, and Cabell's daughter Marina Cabell Hurt served as its postmaster. Hurt is thought to have been the first African American female postmaster in the United States. Piney Grove was renamed Cabell, then renamed Institute after the West Virginia Colored Institute. Under the provisions of the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1890, the West Virginia Legislature established the West Virginia Colored Institute for the education of African Americans in 1891. The state purchased a tract of land from Elijah and Marina Cabell Hurt, and commenced construction of the institute's campus. The state gradually acquired adjacent lots until the campus consisted of approximately . The co- educational West Virginia Colored Institute opened in 1892 and added a military education program in 1899. African American educator Booker T. Washington, a former Kanawha River valley resident from nearby Malden, frequently visited the institute's campus as a guest lecturer. The institute's first president, Byrd Prillerman, was a friend of Washington, who had recommended Prillerman for the position in 1909. The West Virginia Colored Institute gradually became the center of African American intellectual and academic life in West Virginia, and in 1915 it became known as the West Virginia Collegiate Institute to reflect its authority to grant college degrees as a post-secondary educational institution. In 1929 the institution's name was changed to West Virginia State College. = Development of state recreational facilities for African Americans = In response to the tremendous damage to West Virginia's natural environment from mineral and lumber exploitation, the state began the development of its state park system in the 1920s. The state recognized the need to designate and protect lands worthy of conservation, and in 1925 the Legislature established the West Virginia State Forest, Park and Conservation Commission to assess the state's opportunities and needs for forests, parks, game preserves, and recreational areas. The Legislature established the West Virginia Conservation Commission, Division of State Parks, in 1933 to manage the state's growing park system, and to leverage the resources and expertise of the New Deal-era programs for park development. The park system continued to expand and consisted of approximately by the mid-1930s. Great Chestnut Lodge, Camp Washington-Carver Complex Despite West Virginia's growth in state parks, in both acreage and in number of locations, its state park system was not accessible by African Americans. During the 1930s, West Virginia's historically black colleges (Bluefield State Teachers College, Storer College, and, primarily, West Virginia State College and its extension service) became the center of a movement to provide educational outdoor and recreational activities for West Virginia's African American youth. The movement succeeded in taking advantage of available West Virginia Board of Control funding from the Works Progress Administration (WPA) when the Legislature established Camp Washington-Carver in 1937 near Clifftop in Fayette County. The African American 4-H camp was constructed by the WPA between 1939 and 1942 and was transferred from the West Virginia Board of Control to the West Virginia State College extension service, which offered instruction to African American children and adolescents in the subjects of agricultural education, soil conservation, home economics, and 4-H values. West Virginia State named the 4-H camp complex after African American educators Booker T. Washington (a Kanawha River valley native) and George Washington Carver. Its Great Chestnut Lodge is notable as being the largest log structure in West Virginia built entirely of chestnut. Camp Washington-Carver was formally dedicated on July 26, 1942.  Park establishment and operation  The West Virginia Conservation Commission, Division of State Parks, had expanded to 13 state parks by 1945; however, West Virginia still restricted the access of African Americans to its state parks. In 1940 the NAACP contacted the Division of State Parks and inquired about the accessibility of African Americans to West Virginia state parks. The Division of State Parks responded by stating: \\"Negro citizens would feel ill at ease\\" at visiting state parks alongside white residents, and that the division was deliberating the construction of a state park for African Americans. Booker T. Washington By 1949 private citizens had donated of deciduous forest land outside the largely African American community of Institute to the Division of State Parks for the construction of an African American recreational area. On August 5, 1949, West Virginia Conservation Commission Director C.F. McClintic formally announced that a public day-use recreational area for African Americans was being developed in Institute, and would be named for Booker T. Washington. At the time of the announcement, a water well was being drilled and picnic and sanitary facilities were being installed. Present-day Pinewood Drive had already been constructed from West Virginia Route 25 to provide access to the park location, and a parking area for 15 cars had already been completed. According to McClintic, the park's name was selected by the West Virginia Conservation Commission following consultation with West Virginia State College President Dr.John Warren Davis. Booker T. Washington State Park opened in 1949 as the only state park accessible to African Americans. Following the park's completion, its limited facilities included the water well, ten picnic tables, fireplaces, toilets, and the parking area. According to National Park Service (NPS) surveys of state parks in 1950 and 1955, Booker T. Washington State Park lacked swimming facilities, cabins, campsites, and refreshment stands. Unlike other West Virginia state parks, Booker T. Washington also lacked scenic views and hiking trails. Also unlike other state parks, the Division of State Parks did not keep statistics on its visitors. By 1954, West Virginia's state park system consisted of , with only the Booker T. Washington State Park explicitly open to African Americans. Following the Brown v. Board of Education decision by the United States Supreme Court in May 1954, West Virginia Conservation Commission Director Carl J. Johnson announced the integration of Booker T. Washington State Park, thus allowing whites to utilize the park's facilities. Johnson also stated that Booker T. Washington was the only state park operated on the basis of segregation and that no further changes would be made to state park policies following the Brown v. Board of Education ruling. Booker T. Washington remained a day-use state park with picnic facilities; however, by 1957 it was without a supervisor. The park was no longer in operation by 1959 when it was omitted from the listing of state parks in the West Virginia Blue Book and the park was also omitted when the NPS released its 1960 survey of U.S. state parks. The 1958 West Virginia Blue Book did not include a listing of West Virginia state parks.  Significance and legacy  Booker T. Washington State Park was the only state park ever to operate in Kanawha County. When the West Virginia State Park History Committee and former Division of State Parks chief Kermit McKeever published their book Where People and Nature Meet: A History of the West Virginia State Parks in 1988, there was no mention of Booker T. Washington State Park.

Majority of these, however, were indeed ethnic Turks. In the Ottoman Empire, the Islamic faith was the official religion, with Muslims holding different rights than non-Muslims. Non-Muslim (dhimmi) ethno-religious legal groups were identified by different millets (\\"nations\\"). Turk was also notably used to denote all groups in the region who had been Islamized during the Ottoman rule, especially Muslim Albanians and Slavic Muslims (mostly Bosniaks). For the Balkan Christians, converting to Islam was synonymous with Turkification, succumbing to \\"Ottoman rule and embracing the Ottoman way of life,\\" hence \\"to become a Turk\\". In South Slavic languages, there are also derivative terms that are more-so seen as offensive towards Bosniaks, such as poturiti, poturƒçiti and poturica (all essentially meaning \\"Turk\\" or \\"to turkify\\"). Slavic Muslims follow the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, the most dominant school in the Ottoman Empire. According to the religious ideology of Christoslavism, coined by Michael Sells, religion played a key role in maintaining alliances and ethnic identification during tumultuous ethnic conflicts in Southeastern Europe for centuries, from the High Middle Ages onward. Sells postulates that there existed a \\"belief that Slavs are Christian by nature and that any conversion from Christianity is a betrayal of the Slavic race\\" as seen in Croatian Roman Catholic and Serbian Eastern Orthodox ethnic and nationalist movements. Slavic Muslims were, therefore, not regarded part of their ethnic kinship, as by conversion to Islam, \\"they have become Turks\\". In Greece and in the Greek language, the same belief was held about Greek Muslims, that they had essentially \\"become Turks\\", while tourkalvanoi (\\"Turco-Albanians\\") became a common term for Muslim Albanians who had been a significant minority in the country. All of these terms are now considered pejorative ethnic slurs in their respective languages as well as by those groups that they refer to. Following the end of World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, all Ottoman Muslims were made part of the modern citizenry or the Turkish nation.

Some scholars expand this definition to encompass a broader range of actions, such as the process of making art, and the power of organizations and institutions to orient activity around themselves. The concept of materiality is used across many disciplines within the social sciences to focus attention on the impact of material or physical factors. Scholars working in science and technology studies, anthropology, organization studies, or communication studies may incorporate materiality as a dimension of their investigations. Central figures in the social scientific study of materiality are Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan.  Communication studies  Communication studies investigated by scholars include the particular impacts of media as it emerged and spread. In particular, the growth of newspapers, radio, television, personal computing and the Internet have been examined. Collectively, these are termed ‚Äúmedia effects‚Äù studies. Some communication scholars make use of the concept of affordance: the idea that the features of a particular technology may encourage certain behaviours from the technology's users. Other scholars explore how technologies and the communities that use them may be mutually determining (the way users respond to technology tends to drive both features and cultural norms among users of that technology) or they may behave as co-creators (the abilities and limitations of a technology may make it a part of the works created using that technology).  Science and technology studies  Although science and technology studies (STS) are typically associated with a social constructivist viewpoint, some STS scholars (e.g. Langdon Winner) incorporate materiality into their studies of technology and explore how the affordances of technology may shape or even control their use. Actor-network theory, or ANT, is an example of an STS theory which incorporates both social and material interactions.  Toronto School  The Toronto School view of materiality, also known as the ‚Äòmedium‚Äô view, includes the intellectual legacies of Innis and McLuhan, who focused attention on the consequences of the medium, on what authors communicate and on what audiences experience. Innis explored the broad historical consequences of time-bound media (e.g. transportable but fragile media such as papyrus) and space-bound media (e.g. hard-to-transport but longer-lasting media such as stone tablets). Different cultures have used various media to store information and its availability and transportability through time impacts its use. In an extension of Innis' ideas, McLuhan wrote, ‚ÄúThe medium is the message‚Äù, that is, the way people transmit ideas is consequential in and of itself. The influence of the medium can be invisible and difficult to characterize.

It is native to eastern North America, where it is found primarily in the southern Blue Ridge. It is a perennial that produces white flowers in the spring. Its natural habitat is moist cove forests and bottomlands, along streambanks and in seepage areas. Unlike the similar-looking Cardamine clematis which grows in high elevations, C. flagellifera is typically found in low to moderate elevations. This species is considered to be vulnerable due to its limited distribution, and its habitat requirement of forests with an undistributed herbaceous layer. Taxonomy Two varieties are sometimes recognized. These are: *C. flagellifera var. flagellifera - Large-flowered Blue Ridge bittercress; widespread in the southern Appalachian Mountains. *C. flagellifera var. hugeri - Small-flowered Blue Ridge bittercress; has a more restricted range.

Written and directed by Jon McKellan, the game was released on 27 February 2017 for macOS and Microsoft Windows, and on the Nintendo Switch in January 2020. It is a mix of adventure game genres, including text-based adventure, first-person exploration, and puzzle solving, and is themed after technology from the 1980s. The game consists of four episodes, each of them an adventure and horror game. The first, notably, is a remastered version of The House Abandon, a shorter adventure game released as free-to-play in August 2016.  Gameplay and plot  The story takes place in England, 1986. The first three episodes are ostensibly standalone games. In the first episode, the player has no name or even specified gender, in the second, he's referred to as \\"Mr. Aition\\", and in the third, \\"James\\". It's revealed in the concluding fourth episode that the games are actually all connected in a single story revolving around one player character, James Aition. Most of the game is spent with interacting with fictional computers, either in a single viewpoint, or with the ability to switch between two viewpoints; the third and fourth episodes also involve small segments of first person exploration. = The House Abandon = The unknown player-character plays the eponymous text-based adventure game, The House Abandon. In-game, the protagonist drives up to his family's holiday home, which he recalls fondly. A note in the glove compartment from his father helps him start the power. The player enters and explores the building, finding his old (and fictional) \\"Futuro 128k +2\\" computer, with the same copy of The House Abandon. When the protagonist starts the game, a power outage occurs. When The House Abandon restarts, the environment is different; The eyes are scratched out in photos on the desk, and the digital clock is reset. This time, the house described in the game is in a terrible state with broken windows, stains, a carcass, and a terrible stench, surfacing undesirable memories and feelings in the protagonist. The note keeps changing every time the protagonist reads it, with progressively more horrifying messages as well as becoming physically uncomfortable. Once the player inside the game opens the door of the house, it becomes apparent that actions inside the text adventure are mirrored in \\"real-life\\", as sounds of the player in the game can be heard around the house, and events in the room occur and respond to the environment described in the computer game; the game eventually struggles to distinguish the player sitting and playing, and the player walking around the house. The protagonist becomes aware of another person in the house. They come upstairs, full of anger, disturbed thoughts, and suggestions of vague but horrible past events. They open the bedroom door and eventually enter, standing behind the player-character: the protagonist himself. The episode ends when the computer game forces the seated player-character to repeatedly admit, \\"It was all my fault\\". It then slowly responds: \\"finally\\". = The Lab Conduct = The player-character, Mr. Aition, is seated in a laboratory room. Dr. Daniel Alexander is remotely directing a series of experiments on \\"artifact 23\\", recovered at a crash site and now sitting in a chamber among the laboratory machines. Mr. Aition conducts experiments at his request using the machinery and using another computer to consulting a manual for help. The artifact appears to be an animal heart, which Aition exposes to lasers to restart its beating, before causing it to explode through sound waves. Alexander directs Aition to drill into it, which blows out the lights, drill and monitor. During these experiments, the player can hear Alexander and his assistant talking about him. Despite severe warnings, Alexander directs Aition to open the chamber to \\"make contact\\" with it; A small metallic sphere floating gently out, casting light into Aition's eyes. The sphere seemingly connects with the player, knocking him over, drawing blood, and perhaps doing something the player Aition couldn't see. Alexander states that the player is now a \\"proxy\\", with a connection to the entity's inner core. The sphere communicates its memories through another text adventure game to help Alexander discover what happened to it. The game details the character wakes up after having crashed onto a planet. Escaping the hazardous capsule, an \\"army\\" of people are standing, visible only as silhouettes. One silhouette approaches the player. The story then jumps to the character lying on a bed with wires attached to his chest, after being tortured. They pull out the wires, setting off an alarm in-game mirroring the environment: the laboratory. A \\"specimen\\" leaves its room, where Dr. Alexander realizes the game is actually happening now and begs Aition to stop. He continues, moving the character to the adjacent room, where the character broadcasts something across the network. Alexander implores Aition not to rebel, but Aition continues by playing a minigame with unknown symbols replacing the game. The game ends when the sphere breaks contact, and other similar spheres appear. Alexander declares, \\"They're all free. They're converging. It's over.\\" He asks Aition not to do anything he'll regret. However, the game ends when Alexander says that someday, his experience will haunt him. = The Station Process = James, the player-character, is seated at a desk in an arctic \\"monitoring station\\" in Greenland. On the desk are a two-way radio, a computer, and a microfiche reader (referred in-game as \\"microfilm\\"). There are several other nearby stations, who communicate to James and each other, but he can only complete his tasks as the microphone is broken. The game is a series of puzzles, using the radio and microfilm reader to determine codes for various radio frequencies. Meanwhile, the communication towers warn James to not to go outside for any reason. Something falls onto the roof of James' station, but it is unknown. Another station is ripped out of the ground by an unseen attacker. One of the other stations sees \\"it\\" above their station, as well as James himself, stating, \\"They're here.\\" James is then ordered to realign the transmitter outside, moved by the wind, at which point James is knocked over and dragged outside. He gets up, walks a distance and fixes the transmitter. While he is walking back, miscellaneous objects appear in the environment, as the other stations command James to \\"wake up\\", and \\"tell them what happened\\". The station itself also seems to be connected to a vine, stretching into the sky. The interior is the computer desk from The House Abandon. = The Last Session = This episode begins with the game's opening sequence, thereafter paused as the camera pulls back to reveal it is playing on a television. Dr. Alexander takes the player, James Aition, to an empty room for a session that's being recorded on a cassette recorder: he is recovering from a 2-week coma following an accident, according to Alexander, and the session is aimed at recovering his memories of the events surrounding the accident. In the previous three sessions, James had merged his memories with fantasy, all terminated early due to panic. The sphere from The Lab Conduct appears and transports him to the arctic station. The microfilm now displays the police report: James was in a car crash with his sister, Jennifer, trapped and critically injured. The other driver, Charles Hennings, a retired police officer, was killed, smelling of alcohol with an empty bottle found in the passenger seat. After completing a puzzle, a friend of Hennings, through a message, claims he never talked about alcohol and accuses Aition of irresponsibility. The game switches then to the laboratory, where the interactions with the machine mirror a life-saving operation on himself in the emergency room, where he arrived with no pulse. Following the ER doctor's orders, he restarts his heart, relieving a hemorrhage by drilling into his head. He wakes at the computer desk to play The House Abandon, now detailing the events prior to and during the crash. At the house, full of people due to a New Years' party, James, who is set to leave on a long trip, finds a gift bottle of whiskey from his father, and gets drunk on it. He is then asked by an unsuspecting Jennifer to drive her home. James has a premonition of her covered in blood with the Futuro projecting her bloodied face in a body bag, before having another premonition showing his mother at the hospital being told that Jennifer is dead, but that James is alive, but her mother saying she doesn't want to see him. On the road, Jennifer realizes that James is drunk, but can't convince him to pull over, and they crash into oncoming traffic. Afraid of going to jail and ruining his reputation, he pours some of the whiskey he received from his father onto Hennings and places the bottle in Hennings' car. Police officers arrive, as he approaches the silhouette of one. The sphere then transports him back to the hospital, with the voice of Jen berating him on his behavior and actions, saying that he has to admit his guilt. Walking back into the room, James pushes \\"stop\\" on the tape recorder, per Alexander's orders. Alexander says he'll pass on the information to the police, and James then returns to watching Stories Untold on television.  Production  Stories Untold was originally started as the single first episode The House Abandon in 2016, as an entry to Ludum Dare 36; writer- director and artist Jon McKellan drew on his experience creating Alien: Isolation when creating the game's aesthetic. The game's poster and logo was created by Stranger Things artist Kyle Lambert. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released on 16 January 2020 in the west and on 23 January 2020 in Japan.  Reception  The game received generally positive reviews, holding a score of 81 on review aggregator Metacritic. Eurogamer ranked the game 48th on their list of the \\"Top 50 Games of 2017\\".

Potts set up one of the country's first pediatric surgery programs at Children's Memorial Hospital (later renamed Lurie Children's Hospital) in Chicago. A graduate of the University of Chicago and Rush Medical College, Potts was known for introducing a surgery to address the heart defects that resulted in blue baby syndrome; the procedure became known as the Potts shunt. In addition, Potts performed the first successful repair of a cardiovascular abnormality known as a pulmonary artery sling. He also invented several surgical instruments, with a particular emphasis on devices used in surgery on major blood vessels. Potts remained a surgeon at Children's Memorial Hospital and a faculty member at the Northwestern University Medical School well into the 1960s. He retired to Sarasota, Florida, where he died of a heart attack at the age of 73. Early life Born in 1895 in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Potts moved with his family to a farm in nearby Cedar Grove when he was four years old. After his father died, Potts and an older brother ran the farm. Once he earned enough money, he enrolled in a private school in Cedar Grove and then studied at Hope College in Michigan. Potts, who had learned Dutch from his grandparents, studied Latin, Greek and German at Hope. During his senior year there, he joined the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service and fought overseas in World War I. After the war, Potts resumed his studies in Chicago in 1919. He graduated from the University of Chicago with a Bachelor of Science. (Upon his graduation, Hope College awarded him a Bachelor of Arts.) Potts applied to medical school at the University of Chicago, which at that time involved two years at the University of Chicago and two years at Rush Medical College. He was one chemistry credit short of the requirements for admission to medical school, but chemistry department head Julius Stieglitz allowed him to complete the credit if he could submit the required work in the 18 days that were left the university's academic term. Medical career =Beginnings= Having completed the chemistry course, Potts was able to enroll in medical school. He held a job at a restaurant so that he could afford school. After graduating from medical school, he undertook general surgery training at Presbyterian Hospital in Chicago and at Rush Medical College. In 1925, Potts opened a general practice as a physician and surgeon in Oak Park, Illinois. He did not make much money at first, but by 1930 he had sufficient funds to go to Frankfurt for further surgical training. After spending 1930 and 1931 in Frankfurt, Potts returned to Chicago and practiced general surgery there for several years. In 1942, he went to the Pacific to serve in World War II, setting up the 25th Evacuation Hospital. When he was discharged three years later as a colonel. =Return to Chicago= Returning to Chicago after World War II, Potts decided to focus on problems in pediatric surgery. He worked briefly as Chief of Surgery at West Suburban Hospital. In late 1946, he was appointed Surgeon-in-Chief at Children's Memorial Hospital (CMH). His position came with a faculty appointment at the Northwestern University Medical School. At the time of Potts' appointment at CMH, only a few childhood illnesses could be addressed surgically; appendicitis and pyloric stenosis were two of the most common pediatric surgical problems. Potts recruited experts in several surgical specialties and asked them to commit themselves to developing surgical solutions for pediatric problems. As he was setting up the pediatric surgery program, Potts went to Boston Children's Hospital for three months to observe the workings of that pediatric surgery program. =The Potts shunt= Potts spent considerable time thinking about the surgical correction of heart defects. Working with CMH pediatric cardiologist Stanley Gibson and with pathologist Joseph Boggs, Potts helped create a collection of more than 200 anatomic specimens of various heart defects. The collection was later used extensively by cardiovascular pathologist Maurice Lev. Potts, Gibson, and research fellow Sidney Smith became interested in treating blue baby syndrome, the group of heart defects that result in insufficient blood flow to the lungs. They became intrigued by the idea of somehow connecting the aorta (the body's largest artery, which sends blood to all of the body's tissues) to the nearby pulmonary artery (which sends blood to the lungs). In 1946, Potts and Smith devised an operation for blue baby syndrome. The surgery involved making a tiny incision in the aorta and a tiny incision in the pulmonary artery and then sewing the two openings together. They performed the procedure successfully on 30 dogs before Gibson sent them a 19-month-old patient named Diane Schnell. Schnell was turning blue and fainting frequently. The team felt that she would not live much longer without surgery, so they decided to make her the first patient to receive a Potts shunt. She did well after the surgery and was known to be alive and well in the late 1960s. Potts, Smith and Gibson published an article in JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association in November 1946 in which they described saving three children's lives. They wrote that the new Potts shunt was safer than the standard treatment at the time, the Blalock-Taussig shunt, which sometimes resulted in paralysis or death. =Other contributions, awards and recognition= In 1953, Potts was the first surgeon to successfully repair a pulmonary artery sling, an abnormality in which the lung blood vessels wrap around and compress the patient's windpipe. The patient who underwent this first repair was a five- month-old girl. She was still alive at nearly 25 years of age; like many of the patients who underwent Potts' version of this repair, she had decreased blood flow to the left lung, but she was doing well. Potts and his team also advanced the treatment of a heart defect known as transposition of the great arteries. Potts' work with heart surgery included the invention of at least three surgical devices. His neighbor, Bruno Richter, worked for a medical instrument manufacturer and assisted him with these innovations. The Potts- Smith aortic exclusion clamp closed off only a portion of the aorta so that the Potts shunt could be completed while maintaining blood flow to the spinal cord. He also developed the Potts vascular clamp, which allowed vessels to be clamped without being crushed; this moved vascular surgery forward significantly. A third device, the pulmonary valvulotome, helped surgeons to minimize bleeding when they entered the right ventricle to repair a child's pulmonary valve. Non-cardiac surgical problems in children also interested Potts. Imperforate anus was one of his special clinical interests. Potts made technical improvements to the surgery that was used for infant girls who had imperforate anus with a low rectovaginal fistula. In 1959, he attempted the separation of a set of conjoined twins who shared a heart. Both twins were weakening, but Potts hoped to save the stronger of the two; the child died within four hours of the procedure. He consulted on another case of conjoined twins the next year, but he declined to operate because he felt that the surgery had no chance of success. In 1955, Potts wrote an editorial in JAMA in which he criticized the overall quality of pediatric surgical care in the United States. Potts pointed out that despite the proliferation of U.S. children's hospitals, only eight hospitals had pediatric surgery programs run by full-time pediatric surgeons. He noted that there were only 33 members of the surgical section of the American Academy of Pediatrics and that 12 of those members had practices that were not fully focused on children. While he acknowledged that increasing levels of specialization created new challenges in medical education, he said that parents would soon demand the same quality of care for their children as they did for themselves. Potts served as the president of several medical organizations, including the Institute of Medicine of Chicago, the Chicago Surgical Society and the Chicago Heart Association. He won several awards, including an American Medical Association Gold Medal and the William E. Ladd Medal from the American Academy of Pediatrics. In 1964, Hope College awarded an honorary Doctor of Science to Potts. Personal life A Unitarian, Potts was deeply religious. Colleague Thomas Baffes wrote that Potts was \\"comfortable enough in his relationship with his God and secure enough in his technical excellence and genius not to feel threatened by the ambitious young people he attracted about him.\\" A 1965 newspaper article called him \\"probably the world's only hymn-singing surgeon\\", noting that he might sing \\"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\\" during a difficult surgery versus \\"Jesus Loves Me\\" during an easy case. Potts married Henrietta Neeken in 1922, and they had three children. In 1948, Potts' son, a married 21-year-old father of two, disappeared from the University of Rochester for about two months before he was located in Texas. Later life Potts wrote two books, The Surgeon and the Child (1959) and Your Wonderful Baby (1966). In 1960, he gave up his administrative duties at CMH to devote his time to patient care, but he said that he looked to his younger colleagues to complete the difficult surgeries. Open heart surgery had become common by this time, and Potts said that it should be performed \\"by young men whose fingers are nimble, whose minds are agile, and whose coronaries are pliable.\\" In June 1965, a retirement celebration was held for Potts at the Sheraton Blackstone Hotel; some of Potts' former \\"blue babies\\" were among the 300 people who honored Potts that night. When Potts retired, he moved to Sarasota, Florida. Potts' congenital heart surgery research center was renamed in his honor. In a 1966 interview with the Associated Press, Potts warned about the risks of antibiotic misuse in treating colds and similar illnesses. He died of a heart attack in 1968; influenza had also contributed to his death. He was predeceased by two brothers and a sister, and he was survived by a sister, his wife, three children and 14 grandchildren. Legacy Potts made early and important advances in pediatric surgery, though the surgical shunt bearing his name has been mostly replaced by other surgical techniques. Over time, surgeons found it difficult to judge the appropriate size for a Potts shunt; they were often made either too small (resulting in insufficient blood flow to the lungs and continued hypoxia) or too large (resulting in too much blood flow to the lungs and congestive heart failure). Some babies with a Potts shunt experienced aneurysm formation in the left pulmonary artery and others had severe bleeding when surgeons attempted to \\"take down\\" the shunt. Since the early 21st century, the Potts shunt has occasionally been brought back into use as a palliative treatment for children with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

In 1975, she graduated from Seoul National University in historical education. Afterwards, she became a teacher at Yeouido Middle School. In 1979, she transferred to Daebang Girls‚Äô Middle School before stopping teaching in 1980. She began writing in 1987, when she took a fiction writing class at the Culture and Arts Foundation. In 1990, when she was thirty eight, her short story ‚ÄúSaengtaegwanchal‚Äù (ÏÉùÌÉúÍ¥ÄÏ∞∞ Ecology observation) was published in Modern Fiction and won the Modern Literature New Writer‚Äôs Prize.

Key aims were to reduce programme lengths and costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the trade gap. The policy saw the establishment of the Construction Leadership Council to drive change in the industry.  Background  The report was issued by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in July 2013 during the 2010-15 Coalition Government. The foreword was written jointly by the Secretary of State Vince Cable, Minister of State Michael Fallon and the then Chief Executive of Network Rail David Higgins. The report promised to \\"radically transform the industry\\". It sought to build on the changes implemented as a result of the 1994 Latham Report, the 1998 Egan Report and the 2009 Wolstenholme Report.  Aims  The four principle aims of the policy were: *Reduce whole-life greenhouse gas emissions in the built environment by 50% *Reduce construction time (measured from conception to completion) by 50% *Reduce whole-life costs for built assets by 33% *Reduce the trade gap on construction products by 50% The government also sought to change the public perception of the industry and its work environment, with a particular view of attracting more young people into the sector. The industry was marred by a perception that it tends towards cost overruns, late delivery, contractual disputes and slow to adapt to the technological change. The government seeks a more diverse workforce, improved safety controls and a more desirable workplace. Other targets were to improve investment in research and innovation and to confirm the government's commitment to building information modelling (BIM).  Impacts  One of the key measures was the founding of the Construction Leadership Council, comprising some of the most prominent leaders in the field from industry and government to spearhead change in the industry. This body has introduced the Fair Payment Charter, a non-compulsory agreement between major companies to implement standard 30 day payment terms by 2018, in a bid to reduce the occurrence of late payment in the industry. Another measure has been the move towards recognition of the Construction Skills Certification Scheme as the only acceptable proof of health and safety competence on site. This would be alongside a recognition that a National Vocational Qualification level 2 should be the minimum standard for all workers in the industry. In 2016 the British government mandated that all centrally procured projects should reach BIM level 2. The strategy has been supplemented by the Government Construction Strategy: 2016 - 2020, published in March 2016 by David Cameron's conservative government. The new strategy aims to complement Construction 2025 and implemented a new set of Common minimum standards for construction.

Wolstenholme analysed the British construction industry's performance against the objectives set out in the 1998 Egan Report. His assessment was pessimistic, noting a failure to meet targets in almost all areas bar profitability. Wolstenholme outlined several problems prevalent in the industry and measures that might be taken to resolve them, calling on the industry to use the Great Recession as an opportunity to change its performance.  Background  Constructing Excellence, a UK construction industry organisation, commissioned Wolstenholme to assess the progress made against the recommendations of the 1998 Egan Report. There was a perception that the industry was continuing to underperform - in 2009 there was only a 50% chance of a project being completed on time or on budget. The Wolstenholme Report was published on 30 November 2009 with a foreword written by Michael Latham (who wrote the Latham Report), Sir John Egan and Nick Raynsford (a former construction minister).  Findings  Wolstenholme stated that some progress had been made against Egan's targets, but that the industry's performance fell considerably short in several categories and that compliance with some of Egan's targets was only accomplished in a superficial manner. Egan targeted a 10% year-on-year reduction in capital cost and construction time; a 20% reduction in accidents and defects; a 10% improvement in productivity, turnover and profits and a 20% improvement in predictability. Some improvement was achieved in safety and productivity but only the profitability target was wholly achieved. The improvement was markedly better in the sub-set of demonstration projects selected as case studies by Constructing Excellence than in the industry as a whole. Wolstenholme stated that it was not possible to determine whether improvements in profitability had derived from measures implemented as a result of the Egan Report or through the effects of the continuous economic growth experienced in the years following the Early 1990s recession. Wolstenholme found that the greatest benefit from the Egan Report, as perceived by those within the industry, was a greater focus on collaboration and partnering with some reporting benefits in quality control, whole life costing and safety. Wolstenholme concluded that many of the apparent changes in the industry following Egan were merely paying \\"lip service\\" to the 1998 report. He was largely favourable to Egan's objectives but said it may have been na√Øve to expect a direct relationship between the best practice expected by Egan and the actual steps taken by the industry.  Proposals  In addition to his review of the progress made against the objectives of the Egan Report Wolstenholme made several recommendations of his own. He proposed that the construction sector take the opportunity presented by the Great Recession to rebuild itself as a sustainable, low carbon industry. Wolstenholme proposed a shift of focus to consider whole-life cost rather than the relatively small and upfront design and construction costs. Wolstenholme was generally pessimistic about the future performance of the industry and its capacity for change. He highlighted the lack of \\"joined-up thinking\\" with regards to sustainability and the proliferation of industry bodies which fragmented the industry. He stated that the traditional separation of construction managers along professional and disciplinary boundaries led to compartmentalization and a failure to attract ethnic minorities and women. Wolstenholme decried the trend for clients to focus on short-term economic issues rather than considering the built environment as a long term asset. He noted that clients were tending to move away from collaborative partnering contracts to traditional method to allow them to exploit the increased competition in the market following the recession. Wolstenholme considered that incentives needed to drive companies to invest in innovation instead of being happy to accept moderate returns. He called for change to be driven by contractors and sub-contractors rather than, as traditionally, by clients. Wolstenholme was also critical of government policy, pointing out that there had been nine different construction ministers and nine housing ministers in the nine years preceding his report and that responsibility for training and skills was fragmented across several government departments. He called for the government to reduce waste in its procurement streams and to provide means of improving the training of construction workers.

It allows families to arrange and manage home care for elderly relatives and uses a digital platform to match people seeking in-home assistance with carers. History Cera Care was formally launched in 2016. In November 2016, the company raised ¬£1.3 million from investors including David Buttress, the former CEO of JustEat, and Peter Sands, the former CEO of Standard Chartered. At the time it was the largest seed-round funding in European healthcare history. In April 2017, Cera Care raised a further ¬£1.4 million in financial backing. To date, the company raised ¬£20 million over the past three years. In March 2017, Cera Care partnered with the Barts Health NHS Trust to provide carers for elderly patients in their own homes and accelerating patients' discharge from the five Barts Health hospitals, in order to prevent bed blocking. The partnership also allowed NHS doctors to refer patients to carers through the Cera platform. As the agreement with the NHS was finalised, Cera contracted Uber to transport both patients and carers. Following the launch of its partnership with Uber, Cera Care commenced a partnership with taxi service Gett to deliver items from London chemists to patients at home. Cera Care introduced a chatbot, Martha, in May 2017. Created with Bloomsbury AI, Martha is a virtual assistant able to review patients' digital records and answer questions for both patients and carers, basing the answers on data points gathered by care workers and digitized care records. Cera Care later developed a patient care dashboard to provide patients with on-demand access to care, medications, transportation, food, and doctor's services via tablet computer. It also claims to have developed a platform that predicts patient deteriorations by computing the risk of events such as hospitalisations based on carer input. In 2018, Cera Care expanded to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, in addition to acquiring care businesses in Huddersfield and Nottingham. As part of their growth plans, they invested ¬£10 million to expand to 14 cities across the UK and roll out new technologies, as well as launch a major recruitment drive for the social care sector through social media. At the beginning of 2019, Cera Care partnered with IBM to test sensors used in self-driving cars to help with monitoring of elderly people. The aim of this new product was to use the data collected by sensors and alert caregivers of any change in patterns that could signify a deterioration in patients‚Äô health, allowing them to respond faster and consequentially reduce avoidable hospital stays. Also in 2019, Cera care launched its Smart Care app, which uses machine learning and data from 68,000 care records, reviewed by professionals, to predict and alert carers to possible health deteriorations with 82% accuracy. It acquired the domiciliary care division of Mears Group in February 2020.  Corporate affairs  = Management structure = The founders of Cera Care are Mahiben Maruthappu, doctor, and health policy specialist, and engineers and entrepreneurs Marek Sacha, and Martin Ocenas. Former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg was Chairman of Cera Care‚Äôs Advisory Board in 2018, a position later taken on by Sir David Behan, former CEO of the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Among the members of the Advisory Board are Dame Carol Black, former President of the Royal College of Physicians and Thomas Zeltner, former Vice- Chair of the World Health Organisation. = Operations = Cera Care provides different kinds of elderly care: palliative care, live-in care, post-discharge care, respite care and dementia care. According to the Health Service Journal, the firm failed to register with the Information Commissioner's Office until February 2018, and was allegedly operating without the proper regulation. In May 2018, the company was accused of misrepresenting some partnerships with the National Health Service and clinical commissioning groups and placing and placing fake reviews of its services were placed on Trustpilot and Facebook. Following the allegations, CeraCare removed mentions of the partnerships that were not up to date from its website and investigated reviews on Facebook and Trustpilot. Regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the company achieved a rating of Good in December 2019, following an inspection undertaken in October 2019. The company started its operations in London and has since expanded to the rest of England.  Performance  As of 2017, Cera Care claimed to have 20 partnerships with NHS organisations, councils, and public organisations, including Dementia Action Alliance. It won the Health Startup of the Year award at the British Startup Awards; the Award for Dementia Care and Rising Star at the LaingBuisson Awards; and the Digital Health Innovation of the Year award at the Global Awards. Cera Care was also included at the European Innovation Summit as one of the EU's Top 50 Startups. In October of 2018 the UK Government and Secretary of State for Health launched their Vision for the Future of Healthcare in the country. Cera Care was used as a case study for what the future of British care could look like.

They are from the film‚Äôs most seminal moments, and they hold all the suspense.

After the trailer's release on YouTube, it received more dislikes than likes. However, it was also the #1 trending in Nepal. This led to speculations that someone paid to get the dislikes.

Its construction is unusual in that it is built around a timber frame, unlike the more common stone construction of houses of this date and location. It is a Grade II* listed building. The associated gate piers and garden walls, and the separate barn have their own Grade II listings. History The hall is dated 1619 and the builder was John Powell of Llangattock Lingoed, from whom the name \\"Pool\\" derives. The mansion was extended in the mid-17th century and the \\"impressive new staircase\\" was added at this time. Few subsequent alterations to the house have taken place. The hall remains a private residence. Architecture and description The timber frame construction is described by the architectural historian John Newman as \\"remarkable\\". Cadw records the construction as \\"more reminiscent of the tall jettied town houses of Hereford or Gloucester than the typical stone house normally found in Monmouthshire\\". The building stone used to case the timber frame is shale. The house is built to an L-plan, of three storeys, with \\"three great chimney-breasts\\". The roof is of slate. The interior contains a dog-leg stair in oak, which Newman describes as a \\"splendid object\\" but does not consider to be original to the house. The hall is a Grade II* listed building.

Sinking of MV Wilhelm Gustloff  was a German cruise liner laid down on 4 August 1936. Intended to be christened Adolf Hitler, she was eventually named after Wilhelm Gustloff, the assassinated leader of Nazi Party Foreign Organisation in Switzerland. She was launched into the Elbe on 5 May 1937. The liner was constructed by Blohm & Voss, Hamburg as part of the Kraft durch Freude (Strength through Joy) program to endorse low-cost voyages for the German working class, with the belief that happy workers work harder. Up to 30 luxury liners had been planned, but only two were ever built. Wilhelm Gustloff was the flagship, and was her sister ship. At the outbreak of the war in 1939, the ship's original purpose came to an end.

After that, she became a floating barracks (accommodation ship) for around 1,000 men of the 2nd U-boat Training Division in the port of Gotenhafen (now Gdynia). Wilhelm Gustloff was moored there for more than four years until 1945 before she was put back into service as part of Operation Hannibal. Commenced on 23 January 1945, Operation Hannibal was a German naval action under the initiative of Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz to evacuate German civilians and military personnel from the Baltic (Courland, East Prussia, and Polish Corridor) as the Soviet Red Army advanced. Doenitz asserted that the operation was to evacuate as many lives as possible away from the already-begun Soviet reprisals. Ships of all kinds took part in this massive rescue operation, which ceased in May 1945 as the war ended. At 1230 hours on 30 January 1945, Wilhelm Gustloff left Gotenhafen for Kiel. By 1500 hours she had reached the open sea. It was snowing, with a temperature of and strong wind of . According to the ship's official records, 6,000 to 7,000 people were registered. In fact, more than 10,500 people were on board, exceeding her designed capacity by about 8,650. The ship was 'Noah's Ark' for those escaping the advancing Soviet Red Army. At 2108 hours, only about after her departure, she was torpedoed by the Soviet submarine , commanded by Captain Aleksandr Marinesko. Before sinking Wilhelm Gustloff, Marinesko was facing a court martial for drunkenness. Four torpedoes were prepared and each had one nickname: 'For Motherland', 'For Leningrad', 'For the Soviet People', and 'For Stalin'. The first three were launched successfully and struck the port side of the ship. After being struck, the ship listed rapidly to port. Within an hour, she sank beneath the Baltic Sea. 9,343 lives were lost, up to half of them children. This remains the worst single ship sinking in history and is dubbed \\"the German Titanic.\\" The number of casualties is six times greater than that of Titanic. 1,215 were picked up by eight German ships that came to the rescue. S-13 launched two torpedoes at one of them without scoring any hits. On 10 February 1945, S-13 sank another evacuation ship SS Steuben that was carrying about 5,000 people where only 650 survived. In the end, only about 10 percent of the passengers survived, because many of the lifeboats were unusable, and the crew essential for lowering them were either trapped or dead by the first torpedo impact. Additionally, overcrowding that led to chaos trapped many passengers below decks, and the frigid waters of the Baltic Sea diminished the chance of survival for the floating survivors. Wilhelm Gustloff was a legitimate target, and her sinking was not regarded as a war crime, because she was no longer a cruise liner nor a hospital ship, but had been converted as a floating barrack or accommodation ship for 1,000 members the 2nd U-boat Training Division. Additionally, she was armed with anti-aircraft guns and was transporting over 1,000 military personnel.

Both countries are separated by the Baltic Sea and have had a very long historical contact, and it also survived several conflicts between the two countries as well.Relations between Poland and Sweden over the centuries At the beginning of 20th century, Poland and Sweden did enjoy a close relationship only to be interrupted by Soviet and German invasions to Poland. After World War II, both re-established relations and Sweden has become the largest economic contributor for Poland among the Nordic countries. Both Poland and Sweden are EU members. There are over 90.000 Poles in Sweden and residents from both countries visit the other frequently. History The Jagiellonian dynasty which ruled Poland from 1386 to 1596 was thought to have some Swedish ancestry and played a significant role in developing Poland into a major European power in the medieval days of Europe. One of Poland's most significant rulers, Sigismund III Vasa, was also partly Swedish through his father King John III of Sweden. Sigismund's mother was Polish Princess Catherine Jagiellon. At the same time, both Poland, as part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, and Imperial Sweden had ambitious plans to expand territorial gains and consolidate power, which led to many major conflicts between the two nations, challenging the power of each. At peak, the Swedes invaded Poland once, known as the Swedish Deluge, which later had razed much of Poland after serious destructions by the Swedish invaders. The weakening of Poland had been contributed by the brutal Swedish invasion. In the 18th century, the partitions of Poland awoke Swedish fear of suffering a similar fate at the hands of Russia, but after the Russo‚ÄìSwedish war ended in 1790, successful Swedish diplomatic missions prevented such an outcome. Sweden was the main destination for many immigrants from partitioned Poland. =Two World Wars= During both World War I and World War II, the Polish community in Sweden were very supportive of independent Poland without being controlled by both the Germans and the Russians. Especially during World War II, several members of Home Army used Sweden, a neutral country, to facilitated and funded for the Polish resistance. Several Swedish citizens had also helped and supported Polish resistance and gave them shelters, also protect Poles from being hunted by the Nazis.

His father was Francesco Giacomelli, of Bolognese origin, first astronomer at the R. Osservatorio del Campidoglio, and his mother was Maria n√©e Marucchi, from a family of scholars. Raffaele Giacomelli's paternal great-grandfather, Raffaele, jurist, had been rector of the University of Bologna, and his uncle, Orazio Marucchi, was a famous archaeologist. After secondary school at liceo Nazareno Roma, he enrolled at the Sapienza University of Rome, where he obtained his degrees in mathematics and natural sciences. After some years of secondary school teaching, he served from 1913 to 1918, with the rank of captain of military engineering, in the aeronautical service at the Italian Air Force base at Vigna di Valle (about 40 kilometers northwest of Rome). From 1920 to 1930 he worked for the central aeronautical institute at the Ministry of Aeronautics as editor-in-chief of technical publications; he was a lecturer, and was later responsible for the library, at the experimental aeronautical institute of Rome. From 1930 to 1940, he was the director of research and development in aeronautics. Giacomelli became in 1928 a libero docente teaching the history of mechanics at the School of Engineering of the Sapienza University of Rome from 1928 to 1948. From 1920 to 1924 he directed and edited the annual publication of the Atti dell'Associazione italiana di aeronautica, which was transformed in 1925 into the journal Aerotecnica, of which he was editor-in- chief from 1925 to 1948.

The report was written by Ragnar L√∂fstedt and recommended the revocation of regulations that were of no benefit, updating of approved codes of practice and the abolition of the \\"strict liability\\" to mitigate all risks. The report resulted in a review of all Approved Codes of Practice by the Health and Safety Executive and the revocation of two regulations that were perceived to be of no benefit.  Background  The report was commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions in March 2011 to look at the existing level of health and safety legislation and the burden it placed on businesses. Professor Ragnar L√∂fstedt, director of the King's Centre for Risk Management (King's College London), was appointed to lead the study and he published the report on 28 November 2011. Recommendations L√∂fstedt reviewed approximately 200 regulations and 53 approved codes of practice (ACoP) that came within the remit of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). He noted that whilst the overall volume of legislation was in fact less than that of 35 years ago there would be benefits from consolidating the existing regulations into sector-specific packages, as had been done recently with explosives legislation, which had previously been spread across numerous regulations. L√∂fstedt made 26 recommendations, all of which were accepted by the government in their response to the report. L√∂fstedt recommended that the HSE revise all ACoPs as some were out of date or overly complex. He recommended the revocation of the Notification of Conventional Tower Cranes Regulations 2010 for which he could see no benefit and the Construction (Head Protection) Regulations 1989 which were duplicated by the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992. One major proposal was that those self-employed persons whose work had no potential to harm others be exempted from health and safety law, as was the case in several European countries. He also wanted to see the use of \\"as far as reasonably practicable\\" (meaning that health and safety measures should not be disproportionate to the risk) extended to all health and safety legislation to abolish the \\"strict liability\\" to mitigate all risks that was relied upon by many compensation claims. L√∂fstedt also proposed that the HSE assume responsibility for directing all investigations and enforcement actions, some of which came under the purview of local authorities instead.  Response  The official government response to the report acknowledged that there was a fear of prosecution for minor offences amongst the self-employed and directed the HSE to draw up proposals to remove aspects of health and safety law for low-risk occupations, which was believed to apply to around one million people. They stated that there was a very low likelihood of any such persons being prosecuted for minor offences before the change. The government agreed to increase training for local authority inspectors to try to ensure a more consistent standard of inspection. The Notification of Conventional Tower Cranes Regulations and Construction (Head Protection) Regulations were revoked, as recommended by L√∂fstedt, in April 2013. But it refused to give the HSE responsibility for directing all inspection and enforcement, leaving many duties with local authorities. The Institution of Construction Safety raised concerns that there was insufficient time and capability for the HSE to review all approved codes of practice by April 2012, as L√∂fstedt had recommended, though the review itself was welcomed. Other bodies stated that clarity was needed on which self-employed persons would be exempt and whether a sufficient level of health and safety would be maintained by these persons. There was also a wish to ensure enforcement proceedings were carried out in a timely manner, within three years of the breach of regulations. L√∂fstedt's report was broadly welcomed, and seen as a way to reduce the regulatory burden on small and medium enterprises by emphasising the need for risk-based rather than hazard-based regulation (i.e. focusing on the likelihood of an event rather than its severity). He produced a follow-up review of recommendations in 2012, but declined to revisit the report when asked to do so in 2013.

Mangemange is an endemic species and is unique compared to other ferns in the area due to the vine‚Äìlike curtain it creates in the canopy. Although the majority of the plant is found in the canopy of the surrounding forest, the roots and stem of mangemange form on the ground, meaning it cannot be classified as an epiphyte. Description Lygodium articulatum roots extend laterally from the stem (rhizome) of plant. Rhizomes on mangemange are hairy and long-creeping, forming widely spaced fronds. Fronds grow alternately from the stem and form dichotomous costae that twist and climb until they find nearby branches or trees. Once the plant has the support of neighboring branch, stipes and pinnae form. Mangemange will form sterile pinnae (10 cm) or fertile pinnae (1 cm). Sterile pinnae are flat and smooth while fertile pinnae are wrinkled and fan shaped and end in spore structures that release a yellow dust when ripe. Lygodium articulatum will often grow rapidly high in the tree, where they can become walls or curtains of leaves and twiggy vines. It is often difficult to navigate through due to the strength of the rhizomes. Distribution and habitat Mangemange is mainly found on the North Island of New Zealand, specifically in the Northland, Auckland, Volcanic Plateau, Gisborne and Taranaki regions. It grows from sea level to in elevation. Since it is a climbing fern that uses neighboring structures to grow, its habitat is mainly based on the distribution of other species such as the mƒÅnuka and kƒÅnuka scrub, and in kauri, podocarp and broadleaved forest. Native use The term \\"Bushman's mattress\\" comes from the springiness of the vines and stems of L. articulatum. The MƒÅori would make beds by coiling the springy vines and putting them in sacks, then stuff the sacks with available soft flora. Natives also used the tough wiry stems for things like fishhooks, rope, thatching, and eel traps. The leaves and fronds were infused with water and drunk to cure stomach aches and pains. When dried out, the leaves give off a pleasant aroma and were at times even used as a type of diaper.

Possibly, the name alludes to the Libyan religious brotherhood of the Senussi, which fought against the Italians who occupied Libya during World War I. The brand was discontinued in 2002. History A classical Senoussi pack Senoussi was created in 1921 and was launched in 1926 by Reemtsma, which manufactured and commercialise the brand until 2002. Germany was the main sales market. There was, for a short period in the 1950s, only a filterless variant. The name and the look (a group of Arabs in a Burnous) put the type of oriental cigarette in the focus. When EU regulations came into force in 2002, further limiting the levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide, the brand, along with countless other orient cigarettes, disappeared off the shelves in Europe, along with many other oriental cigarette brands. Senoussi cigarettes contained 1.3 milligrams of nicotine and 22 milligrams of tar, years before the strength was reduced to 1.0 mg nicotine and 12 mg tar in the 1990s, a value held up to 2002 when the new EU regulations came into force. A special feature was the length that was roughly equal to those of cigarettes, while most other filterless cigarettes were much shorter.

Despite many differences in organisms‚Äô migratory cues and behaviors, ‚Äúconsiderable similarities appear to exist in the cues involved in the different phases of migration.‚Äù Migratory organisms use environmental cues like photoperiod and weather conditions as well as internal cues like hormone levels to determine when it is time to begin a migration. Migratory species use senses such as magnetoreception or olfaction to orient themselves or navigate their route, respectively. The factors that determine migration methods are variable due to the inconsistency of major seasonal changes and events. When an organism migrates from one location to another, its energy use and rate of migration are directly related to each other and to the safety of the organism. If an ecological barrier presents itself along a migrant‚Äôs route, the migrant can either choose to use its energy to cross the barrier directly or use it to move around the barrier. If an organism is migrating to a place where there is high competition for food or habitat, its rate of migration should be higher. This indirectly helps determine an organism‚Äôs fitness by increasing the likelihood of its survival and reproductive success. Types of migration include: * Animal migration, the physical movement by animals from one area to another  Bird migration, the regular seasonal journey undertaken by many species of birds * Reverse migration, a phenomenon in bird migration  Fish migration, the regular journey of fish  Insect migration, the seasonal movement of insects * Lepidoptera migration, the movement of butterflies and moths * Diel vertical migration, a daily migration undertaken by some ocean organisms  Effects of migration  A species migrating to a new community can affect the outcome of local competitive interactions. A species that migrates to a new community can cause a top-down effect within the community. If the migratory species is abundant in the new community, it can become a main prey for a resident predator, leaving other resident species as only an alternate prey. This new source of food (migrants) can increase the predatory species‚Äô population size, impacting population sizes of its other prey when the migratory species return to their original location. If a resident species experiences a scarcity of food due to seasonal variation, the species can decrease in population, creating an opportunity for a new species to migrate to that location as the decrease in the population of the resident species leaves an abundance of food. Migratory species can also transport diseases long-distance from their original habitat. See also * Animal navigation, abilities used by animals to navigate * Great American Interchange, an event in which fauna migrated between North America and South America one the continents were bridged by the Isthmus of Panama * Human migration, physical movement by humans from one area to another * Plant migration, or seed dispersal, the movement or transport of seeds away from the parent plant  Forest migration, the movement or transport of large seed plant dominated communities in geographical space over time References Ecology Broad-concept articles ","title":"Migration (ecology)"},{"id":"55990646","text":"Wally Henschel (9 September 1893 ‚Äì 13 December 1988) was a German chess master who also lived in the United States.

Biography Gertrude Harvey was the eighth of the ten children born to Ann Crews Bodinnar, n√©e Curnow, and her husband John Matthews Bodinnar, a cooper. Her maternal grandfather, William Curnow, was a market gardener and a notable botanist. Harvey acted as a model for students at the Forbes School of Painting in Newlyn and through the social scene associated with the School met Harold Harvey for whom she also modelled. The couple married in, or around, 1911 and set up home at Maen Cottage in Newlyn. Through modeling, Gertrude Harvey became fascinated by art and by the working methods of the artists based in Newlyn. Among those she modelled for were Laura Knight, Harold Knight and Ruth Simpson. Largely self-taught she became an accomplished artist in her own right, mainly painting still-lifes, flowers and landscapes. Initially, Harvey exhibited and sold her oil paintings and other works through the local Newlyn Art Gallery but throughout the 1920s and 1930s exhibited in various London galleries. One of her London exhibitions, with a catalogue introduction by George Bernard Shaw, was a sell-out with every painting being purchased. As well as taking part in joint exhibitions with her husband, notably at the Leicester Galleries in 1918 and 1920, Harvey also exhibited works at the Royal Academy. Between 1930 and 1949, Harvey had twenty works selected for Royal Academy exhibitions. From 1945 to 1949 she was regular exhibitor with the St Ives Society of Artists. After Harold Harvey died in 1941, Gertrude Harvey continued living at Maen Cottage until 1960, when she moved into a nursing home in St Just.

Takeshi also develops an unhealthy crush on Yuka, having some of his creations targeted her specifically. After Naoto saved him from Kahn, Takeshi developed Grid Hyper Beam, which was used to decimate both Kahn and his home's computer. 22 years later in the event anime Denkou Choujin Gridman: boys invent great heroes, Takeshi bonds with Gridman Sigma, transforming with the Acceptor to fight against real life monsters.

Luckily, Gridman manages to destroy Gilarus with his Grid Beam. : Gilarus's data was upgraded and redesigned by Takeshi with body armor and steel claws, and was used to tamper with time all around the world and the internal clocks of every human; Yuka and Naoto were in the basement at the time and therefore were unaffected. The upgraded monster was destroyed by Thunder Gridman's Thunder Grid Beam. *: An orange dinosaur-like monster with six long spike-like appendages created to track down the owner of the Axepter. Rampaging in an information center's mainframe, sealing Gridman off, Bamora creates a satellite tower that could tear a hole into reality. But Gridman manages to keep Bamora from leaving the Computer World once the portal opened and deletes it with his Grid Beam. : Bamora's data is later upgraded with armor and a mace on both its left hand and tail, used by Takeshi to get revenge on the police by disabling police communications and jail cells. Though it overpowered Gridman, Bamora is destroyed by Thunder Gridman. *: A turtle-like quadrapedic virus with two volcano holes built into its shell that launch powerful fireballs. Volcadon was created to disrupt cell phone frequencies to give its Takeshi's mother a good reason to see him. Volcadon is destroyed by Gridman. *: A blue Pterodactylus-like virus that can turn invisible. Kahn Digifer sent Stealgan into Soichiro's boss's computerized automobile. Though Stealgan overwhelmed Gridman, Yuka sends him a paint program to disable Stealgan's cloaking so he can blast the virus's wings off and finally destroyed it with the Grid Beam. : Stealgan's data was upgraded by Takeshi to get even with a CG art company and stealing color from the city. It was destroyed by Gridman after the Dina Fighter and the King Jet disable its cloaking. *: An aardvark/dinosaur monster with a long-horned nose and blades on each of its arms. In the beginning of the episode, Takeshi was humiliated when a delivery man with fruit crashed into him. As revenge, Takeshi created Bagira to shut down and lock up all the food plants in the city. The sudden food shortage was causing mayhem among housewives and Ippei's hunger was getting troublesome. Unlike previous monsters, Bagira had a major advantage with its blades and was able to deflect Gridman's fireballs and even the Grid Beam. Ippei quickly constructed the Barrier Shield to even the battle; the Barrier Shield's shape and design was inspired by a special hotdog Ippei had been craving. Using his new sword, Gridman severed Bagira's arms, but Takeshi withdrew Bagira from battle. : Bagira was given new arms and was sent into a digital piano in a music shop, but was quickly destroyed by Anoshiras's beam. : Takeshi upgraded Bagira's data, transforming it into Mecha Bagira and used it to reanimate an ancient cadaver that was discovered by a research facility. The corpse went on a rampage throughout the facility and went after Yuka, Daichi, and Kanna, who were visiting at the time. Mecha Bagira's new arsenal included a boomerang on its tail and a robotic eye that allowed Mecha Bagira to target and aim its weapon with accuracy. To win the battle, Gridman used the flamethrower attack from Ippei's new Dragonic Cannon followed by the Grid Beam. *: A hunchbacked reptilian creature with a neck frill and two long spikes on its shoulders that was dwelling inside a digital piano. After Anoshiras destroyed Bagira, Takeshi brainwashed it into Kahn's servant before Yuka reversed its effect to restore the benevolent monster to its actual form. : With Anoshiras under Kahn Digifer's power, ear-piercing sound waves were emitting from the keyboard and slowly spreading throughout the city. Gridman was ready to destroy Anoshiras with the Barrier Shield, but a female humanoid living in the computer world pleaded Gridman to cease. She attempted to free Anoshiras by playing a melody, but Takeshi's music was too strong. Yuka attached her own keyboard to Junk and played a melody powerful to break the spell, restoring Anoshiras. : Takeshi created his own Anoshiras, but in the appearance of its corrupted form. Imit Anoshiras was given the ability to encase Gridman in circuit chips. Starting at his feet, Gridman's speed and mobility were greatly diminished. By the time the chips covered his lower half, all Gridman could do was helplessly swing his sword. Unfortunately, God Zenon did not fair any better as the clone blasted both God Zenon's arms off, forcing the robot to withdraw from the battle. Yuka uploaded a program that freed Gridman from the chips, and Imit Anoshiras was destroyed by Gridman's Grid Beam as the monster was tossed in midair. *: A red dinosaur- like fire virus. Flamelar was sent into Yuka's microwave to overheat its generator, turning it into a timebomb. With only three minutes left on the microwave's timer, Gridman made haste to stop Flamelar before Yuka can be killed in the explosion. Using the Plasma Sword, Gridman severed Flamelar's tail and head, but Khan Digifer recalled the monster before it could be destroyed. With the Fixer Beam, Gridman cooled the microwave's generator. Flamerlar returned and this time was sent into Yuka's air conditioner, heating her home at an unbearable temperature. The monster teamed up with Blizzalar to battle Gridman. But it was by turning the two monsters against with each other that Gridman defeated them with his Gridman Sword. : An upgraded version of Flamelar. After getting busted by a policewoman for seeing another policewoman's miniskirt buttocks, Takeshi sent Mecha Flamelar into the salon blowdryer that was being used on the police woman. Mecha Flamelar's fire breath was stronger and its armor could emit jets of hot steam. Instead of bad hair days, Mecha Flamelar was overheating the salon's equipment that would eventually kill the customers. Ippei modified the Dragonic Cannon into the DinaFighter and blasted missiles at Mecha Flamelar's mouth, destroying its flame power. The monster was destroyed by Gridman's Grid Beam. *: A blue dinosaur-like ice virus with ice breath and able to shoot ice missile from its fingers. Blizzalar first went into Ippei's air conditioner, creating a subzero temperature. After freezing Ippei's house, it went to do the same with Naoto's. During the battle by Khan Digifer's orders, Flamelar joined its icy counterpart. Blizzalar was then destroyed by Gridman's Gridman Sword. *: A ninja virus with ability to speak; in his first appearance, Shinobilar can shoot sparks, carry two katanas, and create multiple illusion clones of himself. His mission was to brainwash the students and faculty at Takeshi's cram school. Some of the students were classmates with Naoto and the gang, when Ippei and Yuka noticed their aggressive behavior, they went to the cram school only to chased away by the enslaved students. Shinobilar had Gridman at his mercy with his clone technique; but Gridman was able to claim victory by hurling the Thunder Axe the real Shinobilar. He is voiced by . : Shinobilar's data was reformed, given the ability to initiate and and wields a kusarigama. This time, Takeshi was playing a virtual shooting game, but was taking too long that the arcade staff forced him off. Angered, Takeshi used Shinobilar to infect the game. The headset took over the player's mind and turned the virtual gun into a real lasergun. Yuka was the unfortunate player; under Shinobilar's control, she went around town shooting everything in sight. The battle seem too easy for Gridman at first, but Shinobilar revealed his ability to make himself incorporeal; all Gridman's attacks passed right through the ninja. After Twin Drill broke Shinobilar's weapon, Thunder Gridman was formed and performed the Thunder Grid Beam. He is voiced by . : An upgraded version of Shinobilar, armed with a nunchaku that can transform into a b≈ç. Its additional abilities are and . He fell to Gridman's King Grid Beam. He is voiced by Hisao Egawa. *: A Hercules beetle/dinosaur-like beast that walked on four legs and sprayed white acidic gas from its mouth. Angered by water pollution, Takeshi had Terragaia go into a city water plant to turn the water supply into hydrochloric acid. With its gas, Terragaia could melt circuit panels and burrow underground in the computer world. While Yuka was analyizing a sample of the tainted water, Gridman alerted the gang about Terragaia. However, Gridman walked into a trap when he entered the plant's computers. His ankles were shackled and was being asphixiated by Terragaia's gas. Luckily, Ippei had finished designing Thunder Jet and Twin Driller; using the new mecha, Twin Driller broke the shackles and Thunder Jet used the Thunder Ring to muzzle Terragaia. Unable to spray its gas, Terragaia was destroyed by Gridman's Grid Beam. *: A metal virus with a bladed left arm and a pincer right arm. On its chest was a red jewel that unleashed a barrier when attacked by beam weapons. After being sent into the city's cash registers, Metallus gave anyone with a credit card 100,000 yen. With their newfound wealth, everyone went on major shopping sprees, especially Daichi. However, little did the populace know, they were actually playing Takeshi's . Whenever a credit card reached zero yen, the register that scanned it would detonate. In battle, Gridman was severely damaged when Metallus reflected his own beam fire back at him. Using the new God Tank, God Tank's cannons blasted the red jewel on Metallus, disabling its barrier. Without the protection of the barrier, Metallus was destroyed by Gridman's Grid Beam. Daichi left his parents with 100,000 yen bills to pay. : An upgraded version of Metallus with a blue jewel on its chest and able fire from its mouth to stun Gridman. Neo Metallus took control of a computer operated backhoe at a dinosaur excavation site and caused the machine to run out of control. Drawing inspiration from dinosaurs, Ippei converted the Dragon Fortress in the Dina Dragon to help the losing Gridman. Neo Metallus was destroyed by the Grid Beam just before the backhoe could destroy the dinosaur bones. *: A quadrupedal reptilian-like monster covered with magnetic plates with two tails. From its shoulders were two appendeges that fired flashes of blinding light. A thief called Kaitou Mati was on the loose and he broke into houses by cracking security systems. He robbed the Babas and proceeded to Taksehi's house, but fled after an encounter with Kahn Digifer. Conveniently, a security expert showed up and offered his new revolutionary home security system called Cat Eye Security. Takeshi learned of the break-in and soon discovered that Kaitou Mati and the expert were the same person! To punish the swindler, Takeshi created Magnegauss to infect the Cat Eye System. Anyone with this system installed would become trapped in their homes. Gridman could not defeat the monster alone; Magnegauss used its magnetic powers to deflect many of Gridman's attacks and drain his power as well. Ippei modified the vehicles to combine into God Zenon giving Gridman the chance to use the Grid Beam to destroy Magnesgauss. *: A spikey dinosaur-like monster that can shake and tremble itself wildly, creating tremors within the computer world. Generadon was sent into a local gym, causing the computerized gym equipment to run wild. Takeshi's intended target was a muscled athlete, but instead put Soichiro, Hideyo, and Hiroshi through a deadly workout. In battle, Gridman could not keep his balance due to Generadon's trembling; like recent monsters, Generadon could also syphon Gridman's energy. With Ippei's quick thinking, God Zenon was modified to form Thunder Gridman and destroyed the monster with the Drill Break. : An upgraded version of Generadon. It was given power sucking armor but could no longer tremble. Mecha Generadon was put into the city's power plant to cut off the electricity. Prior to the battle, Naoto had injured his arm while testing Ippei's electricity generating bicycle. The injury affected Gridman's performance and Mecha Generadon kept biting and attacking Gridman's injured arm. Meanwhile, Ippei had to keep the basement sustained with power by pedaling his bike while Yuka assisted Gridman with Dina Dragon. Mecha Generadon was destroyed by the Grid Beam. *: A silver stag beetle/dinosaur- like monster with jagged fangs and two long powerful tentacles for arms. The monster could also emit disorienting waves from its mouth. Takeshi had awoken from a nightmare about Gridman; he then saw an advert for a new electronic pillow and implanted Dazzlba into the device so others would suffer from nightmares too. Coincidentally, the gang's families all purchased these pillows and were thrust into a dream world. In the dream world, they were greeted by clowns handling out flyers announcing the execution of Gridman! Meanwhile, the real Gridman was able to awaken the trio from their dream state and combat Dazzlba. With help of Dragon Fortress, Dazzlba was destroyed by Gridman's Grid Beam. *: A pinkish-colored plant/dinosaur monster with leaf veins patterned throughout its body. Plandon was sent into a greenhouse that was conducting experiments on flowers. The flowers were altered and began spraying deadly pollen that was spreading throughout the city. With Dina Dragon holding the monster at bay, Gridman destroyed Plandon with Grid Light Saber, slicing the beast into four pieces. *: A monster with spikes on its back, porcupine spines on its belly, and four channels at the base of its neck that sprayed white smoke. Angered by air pollution, Takeshi used Venora to take control of a factory to pollute the city with smog. To add insult to injury, the battle was brodacasted in the sky for the world to see. Even with Dina Dragon's help on the battlefield, Gridman was overtaken by Venora's smoke and passed out, ending the episode in a cliffhanger. Venora was destroyed in the following episode by King Gridman's King Grid Beam. *: A robotic dinosaur- like monster. Destroyed by King Gridman's King Grid Beam. *: A rehashed version of Magnegauss with a chestplate and a camera head. Eyeganger was placed in Takeshi's camcorder which he used to kidnap Yuka. Using video editing software, he subjected her to his perverse fantasies. To cover Yuka's disappearance, Takeshi forged a videotape of Yuka bidding farewell to her friends and family. But Naoto and Ippei had their suspicions and quickly analyzed the tape and learned it was a fake. In battle with Eyegangar, the monster had the ability to increase its bodyheat, making it difficult for Gridman to attack. Ippei analyzed Eyegangar and learned its weak point was its camera head and used God Zenon to destroy it. Eyeganger was destroyed by Gridman's Grid Light Saber. *: A dragon-like monster placed inside a fortune telling machine that altered people's personalities, and even turned Naoto into an insecure coward. Destroyed by Gridman's Neo Superconductivity Kick. *: Created by someone else instead of Takeshi, Teleboze is nothing more than a peach-colored, timid creature with a childish innocent. When Gridman stops it, the monster apologized for the rampage. However, Takeshi rewrites the Kaijuu's data, resulting with Teleboze becoming a mindless monster and had to deleted by King Gridman's King Grid Beam. *: A dinosaur-like monster with a large mouth that has coils in it. He was placed in a robot vacuum cleaner to target people who littered in retaliation for stepping on a discarded gum. Gyurunba would control the vacuum cleaner into shrinking people and sucking them up. Destroyed by Thunder Gridman's Thunder Grid Beam. *: A Ceratopsian-headed dinosaur-type skeleton monster. Destroyed by Thunder Gridman's Thunder Grid Fire. *: An armored cycloptic virus. Destroyed by King Gridman's King Grid Fire. *: A musical delinquent-themed dinosaur-like monster who can make anyone act like a punk. Next to Shinobilar, Goromaking is one of a few monsters to have dialogue and speak to Gridman.

Her research focuses on people's perception of world and how their motivations, goals, and emotions influence it, especially with regards to visual perception.  Biography  Balcetis received a B.A. in psychology and a B.F.A. in music performance from the University of Nebraska at Kearney in 2001. She subsequently attended Cornell University and obtained her Ph.D. in Social Psychology in 2006. Balcetis joined the faculty of New York University in 2006 and was recipient of the NYU College of Arts and Sciences Golden Dozen Teaching Award in 2014. Balcetis is co-editor of the volume, Social Psychology of Visual Perception, with G. Daniel Lassiter. Balcetis was a recipient of the SAGE Young Scholars Award from the Foundation for Personality and Social Psychology in 2011. In 2016, she received the International Society for Self and Identity Outstanding Early Career Award and the Early Career Impact Award from the Federation of Associations in Behavioral & Brain Sciences (FABBS). Her co-authored paper with David Dunning titled Considering the Situation: Why People are Better Social Psychologists than Self-Psychologists was named Best Paper by the International Society of Self and Identity in 2011.  Research  Building on ideas first proposed by Jerome Bruner and Cecile Goodman in 1947, Balcetis has explored how mental and motivational states influence how visual stimuli are perceived and responded to. Her research article with David Dunning Cognitive Dissonance and the Perception of Natural Environments examined the way in which \\"motivation to resolve cognitive dissonance affects the visual perception of physical environments.\\" Cognitive dissonance occurs when an individual finds themselves in a situation that is contradictory to their beliefs, logic, behavior, and attitudes. To resolve the conflict and resume harmony the individual must change themselves or their views. In Balcetis and Dunning's study, participants were given the choice of performing a task that induced cognitive dissonance, such as pushing themselves up a hill while kneeling on a skateboard. After choosing to complete this task (but prior to completing it), participants perceived the slope of the hill to be less steep than a control group who were never given the choice of completing the skateboard task. The results of this study suggest that visual perception may be altered by the process of decision making.

She is Professor of Psychology and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. She is known for contributions to the psychology of science ‚Äì the scientific study of scientific thought and behavior. Her research program has focused on the development of scientific reasoning skills, critical thinking, metacognition, informal reasoning, and constructivist teaching methods, such as problem-based learning and collaborative learning. Kuhn is the author of The Skills of Argument ‚Äì a book examining the development of informal reasoning, which often takes the form of argument or debate. Kuhn's emphasis on argumentation skills as the foundation for critical thinking and analysis is further developed in her book Argue with Me: Argument as a Path to Developing Students' Thinking and Writing, co-authored with Laura Hemberger and Valerie Khait. Other books authored by Kuhn include The Development of Scientific Thinking Skills, Education for Thinking, and Building Our Best Future: Thinking Critically About Ourselves and Our World. Kuhn is a member of the National Academy of Education and a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and the American Psychological Association. She has served as Editor of the journal Cognitive Development and as Editor of the journal Human Development.  Biography  Kuhn completed a Bachelors of Science degree at the University of Illinois. Her first journal article titled Effects of Exposure to an Aggressive Model and \\"Frustration\\" on Children's Aggressive Behavior, co- authored with Charles Madsen and Wesley Becker, was based on Kuhn's undergraduate research. Kuhn continued her education at the University of California, Berkeley where she completed a PhD in Developmental Psychology in 1969 (dissertation title: Patterns of Imitative Behavior in Children from 3 to 8: A Study of Imitation from a Cognitive-Developmental Perspective). Prior to her current position at Teachers College, Columbia university, Kuhn was on the faculty of the Graduate School of Education, Harvard University. Her research has been funded by grants from the Institute of Education Sciences and other agencies.  Research  Deanna Kuhn is an Educational Psychologist interested in the development of scientific reasoning, argumentation, and critical thinking skills. Much of her research has focused on middle childhood (8-13 year olds) and the importance of teaching argumentative reasoning and debate as means of developing the critical thinking and informal reasoning skills necessary for lifelong learning. Kuhn's Education for Thinking project aims \\"to teach children how to use their minds ‚Äì how to think and learn ‚Äì so that as adults they will be able and disposed to acquire whatever new knowledge and skills they may need.\\" Under this view teachers should act as facilitators who encourage students to be responsible for their own learning. Education for Thinking emphasizes the importance of teaching children skills of inquiry that enable them to seek answers to questions they find worth asking and skills of argument that enable them to support their claims with what they know and evaluate the claims of others. In The Skills of Argument, Kuhn discusses argumentation as a form of problem-based learning. She describes the use of open-ended questions such as, \\"What causes prisoners to return to crime after they are released?\\" \\"What causes unemployment?\\" or \\"What causes children to fail in school?\\" as a means of developing students' informal reasoning skills through debate. People have a tendency to exhibit confirmation bias: they readily identify evidence in support of their views, but fail to consider evidence that might falsify their views. Providing opportunities for students to debate ideas with peers may foster the development of critical thinking skills by encouraging them to consider multiple points of view. Kuhn's co- authored monograph Strategies of Knowledge Acquisition explains knowledge acquisition as a process of coordinating new evidence with existing theories. In this study, the authors used a microgenetic method to examine strategies used by college students and preadolescent children in acquiring knowledge in physical and social domains. Participants used a variety of strategies to solve problems and did not always rely on the most effective strategies within their individual repertories. Kuhn and her colleagues discuss the importance of metacognitive abilities to reflect on one's knowledge and manage the choice of problem solving strategies in cognitive development.

Youth and education  After graduating from the Lutheran High School of Sopron.Dr. Elem√©r Hantos Prize, Hantos studied Law and Political Sciences at the University of BudapestM√ºller, 2010: 89. After study visits in Vienna, Leipzig, Paris, Cambridge and OxfordN√©meth, 2005: 71, Hantos obtained a doctorate at the University of BudapestN√©meth, 2005: 71. Shortly after his studies, Elem√©r Hantos became a financial expert in BudapestM√ºller, 2010: 89.  Political and academic career  Elem√©r Hantos embarked on a political career in 1910 and became a member of the Hungarian Parliament for the National Party of WorkN√©meth, 2005: 71. During World War I, Hantos published several books on the Austro-Hungarian wartime public financesN√©meth, 2005: 71. His financial expertise propelled him Secretary of State at the Hungarian Ministry of Trade in 1917M√ºller, 2010: 89. As a representative of the Hungarian government, Hantos participated in negotiations between Germany and Austria-Hungary on a customs unionM√ºller, 2010: 89. In 1918, Hantos was appointed president of the Postal Savings Bank, which served for a brief period as the Hungarian central bank after the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian monarchyDr. Elem√©r Hantos Prize. In parallel to his political career, Hantos started to teach Finance at the University of Budapest in 1917N√©meth, 2005: 71. After the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, Elem√©r Hantos abandoned his political career in Hungary and dedicated himself to the promotion of Central European integration. In 1924, Hantos became an expert at the Economic Committee of the League of NationsDr. Elem√©r Hantos Prize, where he addressed the economic problems in Central Europe. During the interwar period, Hantos promoted Central European integration by publishing several books and by conducting conferences on the economic situation in Central Europe.  Mitteleuropa  During the interwar period, the new borders created by the Peace Treaties of Trianon and Saint-Germain-en-Laye were hindering economic trade in Central Europe. To remedy the situation, Elem√©r Hantos wanted to recreate the economic area of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, extended to the new borders of the successor states, however without restoring the pre-war political orderGodeffroy, 2016: 67. To promote his idea of Central European economic integration, Elem√©r Hantos organised the first Central European Economic Conference with Julius Meinl in Vienna in 1925M√ºller, 2010: 94. Within the Central European Economic Conferences, two visions of Mitteleuropa were confrontedM√ºller, 2010: 94‚Äì96: while Elem√©r Hantos and his followers promoted the economic rapprochement of the successor states of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the German and some Austrian representatives were opposed to the exclusion of Germany from the Central European economic areaGodeffroy, 2016: 69‚Äì70. Because the German vision was more and more dominant within the Central European Economic Conference at the end of the 1920s, Elem√©r Hantos decided to create the Central European Institutes in Vienna (January 1929), Brno (September 1929) and Budapest (Mai 1930), and the Central European Study Centre in Geneva, as an alternative to the Central European Economic ConferenceM√ºller, 2010: 96‚Äì100.

The church is one of the fortified churches of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. History Kamai church in the 19th century. The church in Kamai was founded in 1603 by Jan Rudomin Dusicki and Jan Hajecki. The name of the architect is unknown. Construction took three years so in 1606 the church was opened and was active since then. In 1643 a hospital was founded by the church for the dwellers of the village and nearby area. During the war against Russia the church was burnt down by the Russian army, but rebuilt soon afterwards. In the Great Northern War the church got under cannon fire from the Sweden army and was damaged again. During the reconstruction of the building cannonballs were planted inside the walls as a tribute to the tragic war events. In 1778 a chapel and a crypt were built by the southern side of the church. The church was active even in Soviet times, which is a rare case as communists persecuted religion and closed or even ruined many churches around the country. In 2010-2011 the church underwent a planned repair. Architecture The church is a beautiful example of the defensive Gothic architecture once popular in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Only a limited number of fortified churches survived until now so it has a great historical and architectural value. Later Renaissance elements were added. The church was initially built in a symmetrical way with three naves supported by four columns. After the church was damaged for the first time, the columns were removed and the church became a single-nave. Dimensionally it is close to the square and has an apse and a sacristy. The facade is flanked by two cylindrical towers with rounded embrasures. Both towers are sixteen meters tall and five meters in diameter with the walls over two meters in thickness. The outer side of the church is almost free from the decorative elements except for four niches on the upper frontside. There is an old cross near the church. It was installed about 15th-16th century. The cross is two and a half meters high and was carved of a single granite stone.

Generally, this is divided into two domains: cultural representations of the environment in media and environmental impact of media forms. The first domain, the environment in media, is very broad and can potentially include any form of media that deals with an environmental issue. The second domain, environmental impacts and concerns of media, focuses on the environmental impacts at every level production of media projects and seeks to make media as sustainable as possible  History  The field of ecomedia is still developing and remains mainly an academic discourse. It can be considered a subgroup of media studies, and it crosses the bounds of traditionally ‚Äúsingle media‚Äù disciplines like literature, art history, and music. The website EcomediaStudies.org was created in 2009 by Steve Rust and Salma Monani as a forum to generate conversation about ecomedia and to make a space for people writing about ecomedia to publish their work. The website‚Äôs creators sketch the history of their field as developing out of ‚Äúthe 2009 Association for the Study of Literature and Environment (ASLE) conference in Victoria, British Columbia‚Äù which featured a special session and several panels on Ecological Media. Although the website has since been shut down, due to the creators wanting to focus on promoting the study of ecomedia, the website is still up and holds a significant amount of information about ecomedia and its development. In 2015 Rust and Monani, along with Sean Cubitt, edited and published Ecomedia: Key Issues (Key Issues in Environment and Sustainability), a book that outlines the important factors at stake in ecomedia studies by looking from various theoretical perspectives at the interactions of environmental issues and media. The text covers multiple types of media with chapters on photography, cinema, newspaper strips, radio, television, mapping systems, advertising, and video games  Environment Through Media  Ecomedia can be a tool for understanding how environmental issues appear and evolve in culture through the study of both traditional and new media. Cultural ideas about the environment can manifest in film, television, music, visual arts, and video games. Ecomedia often aims to promote a dialogue surrounding themes of environmental topics. = Film and Television = Digital media offers numerous outlets to share different perspectives on the environment. Within the realm of film and television, there are numerous approaches that exist. The subcategory of television is made up of news broadcasting, entertainment and educational television shows, advertisements, short films, and more. Each has different motives behind their approach of the topic, which also varies between cultures, environments, societies and political structures. There are channels dedicated to providing educational knowledge about the environment and human interactions with the environment, such as National Geographic. There are also television shows that are meant to provide education knowledge about the environment to children in a cartoon format. All of these forms of television are useful for answering the question of how environmental topics are portraying through media sources and what their intentions are. There have been numerous studies that look at whether or not this is a successful and educational way to promote environmental awareness. The category of environmental films has similar opportunities for creative approaches to address the topic of the environment. Aside from the published media, celebrity status can led a voice to the environmental movement. The well-known actor and environmentalist, Leonardo Dicaprio, has both been featured in and been the director of environmental focused films. The idea that celebrity status can give attention to both good and bad aspects of the environment and its conservation is a growing trend for environmentalism as well as other global topics. The argument that individuals, such as celebrities are becoming a part of the spectacle of conservation, driven by the consumerist aspect of media. The overarching media forms of film and television can address the environment through undertones and hidden messages, using it to create plot, or coverage of an existing or past environmental concern. = Music = Similarly, musicians have participated in the call to action of the environmental movement. Artists have utilized their fame to publicize issues of environmental crisis through their lyrics. Iconic examples such as Joni Mitchell‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Yellow Taxi‚Äù and Marvin Gaye‚Äôs ‚ÄúMercy Mercy Me‚Äù have narrated reactions to the rising environmental movement. Lyrical representations of environmental crises serve to bring them to mainstream attention. For examples see: List of songs about the environment = Visual Arts = Artistic representations of environmental crises have increasingly been represented in contemporary art. Environmentally focused visual art has acted as both a reaction and stimulus to action regarding environmental crises. Environmental art is a recent development, only developing in the late 1960s. The pieces can serve as both visual pleasure and also political statements. Often, artists are starting to use recycled materials to convey their message while aiming to share their ideas in practice by using trash materials and making them into pieces of beauty. For examples see: Environmental Art = Video Games = Another approach to raising environmental consciousness in media aims to target a younger generation of consumers through video games. Video game publishers are releasing games that offer lessons about human impact on the environment, eco systems, and solutions to climate change through building sustainable communities. Some research suggests that video games could be an effective tool for teaching environmental ethics.  Media as Environment  This approach to ecomedia focuses on examining the physical impact that our media practices have on the environment, concerning our use of natural resources in creating and distributing different forms of media. Ecomedia acts as a form of environmental critique through extended engagement with ‚Äúthe production, distribution, consumption, and cultural afterlife of particular media genres and works‚Äù. It seeks to reform the way in which we use natural resources to promote safer and more environmentally-friendly practices. =Examples= E-Waste E-waste can be broadly defined as business and consumer electronic equipment that is at or nearing the end of its functioning life. It can include cellular devices, computers, televisions, printers, microwaves, copiers, stereos, and other common electronic items. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, only 12.5% of electronic waste is recycled in the US. Additionally, the volume of global e-waste is projected to grow to 65 million tons by the end of 2017, an increase of 33% of its current volume. Many components of e-waste can be recycled or reused in some way, prompting the creation of a number of ecomedia measures to address this issue. Wastefulness of Storing Electronic Media There are around 12 million servers driving approximately 3 million data centers. Energy waste is a major problem regarding the media stored in these data centers. According to a study by NRDC, most electricity waste is from smaller-size data centers. Currently, the electricity usage is around 91 billion kilowatt-hours which equals the power generation of 34 coal-fired power plants. Additionally, the rising electronic media demands will increase electricity consumption to around 140 billion kilowatt hours a year. Worsening this situation is that most of the 12 million servers within the United States are idle. This means that they are consuming electricity without performing useful work. E-Cycling Electronics recycling, or e-cycling, is the practice of finding other means to dispose of electronics besides regular trash services. =Reasons to E-Cycle= E-cycling provides a means to remedy the physical waste problems surrounding much of ecomedia. Ecomedia waste requires intensive mining and manufacturing practices, which has a substantial impact on the natural land area around those sites. Practicing eco-cycling can prevent increased mining for ecomedia resources, as many recycling programs do actually reuse the materials from older products. Additionally, many of the products contain hazardous materials. Batteries, television components and even smartphones can cause damage to the natural environment if they are allowed to sit in a landfill. E-cycling facilities are able to handle this waste appropriately. =E-Cycling Options= =Public= Many local government agencies enforce restrictions on what ecomedia waste is allowed to be disposed of in the general trash, because of its hazardous nature. Products such as computer components, laptops and tablets, televisions and DVD players are restricted from regular trash. Additionally, many municipalities will offer special collection dates and times for electronic waste or require residents to schedule a special pickup for those items. =Private= Private companies also offer programs to recycle and reuse discarded electronics. Similar to the public option, many private companies will accept on-location drop-offs of computer parts or cell phones. Not every company will accept every type of electronic waste product, and some may charge a small fee. =Apple= Apple has implemented a complementary reuse and recycle service that allows users to exchange computers, iPads, and iPhones for store credit if the device qualifies for reuse. If the device does not meet the criteria for reuse, Apple will recycle it at no cost to the consumer. The company partners with Li Tong Group, a Hong Kong electronics recycler which breaks down every component of the old phone and captures 100% of the chemicals and gas emissions that are created during the process.

He was of working class origin, and became involved in trade union activity while young. He was a supporter of the revolutionary socialist Louis Auguste Blanqui. He was imprisoned for his role in a strike of coal miners in 1886. He was elected to the national legislature in 1889, holding office until 1906, and was reelected from 1910‚Äì14. He always supported workers and people who were suppressed for their views or political activities. Later he moved towards antisemitism and a more nationalistic form of socialism. Early years Ernest Jean Roche was born on 19 October 1850 in Bordeaux. His father was a worker. Ernest Roche began work as an engraver in Bordeaux while very young, and soon became involved in trade union affairs. Socialist leader Roche was a committed supporter of Louis Auguste Blanqui. He was a member of the Blanquist Revolutionary Socialist Committee of Bordeaux. In 1879 Roche led this committee in the campaign for Blanqui to be elected to the Chamber of Deputies. They organized a coalition of radical, socialist and revolutionary groups in support of Blanqui against the moderate republican incumbent, and Blanqui was elected in April 1879. The election was annulled, and Blanqui's reelection in August 1879 was also annulled. However, the campaign contributed to obtaining a pardon for Blanqui and helped the Communards' amnesty proposal to pass in the Chamber of Deputies. Roche was made secretary of the Chambre Syndicale des M√©caniciens. He was a delegate of the workers' unions at the Third Socialist Workers' Congress in Marseilles in October 1879. At this congress Roche was among the Collectivist orators who called for intellectual, economic and political war between the classes. The violent demands at this congress led to an amnesty being granted to the socialist leaders who had been prescribed in 1871 after the fall of the Paris Commune. Roche began building a revolutionary party in Bordeaux after the Blanqui campaign, but before the job was done decided to move to Paris. He arrived in Paris in 1881. Roche was not able to find a job as an engraver in Paris, but Henri Rochefort gave him a position on his journal L'Intransigeant despite his apparent lack of qualifications. He was in charge of the workers' section of L'Intransigeant until 1906. Industrial action A strike began on 26 January 1886 in Decazeville, Aveyron department. among the workers of the Soci√©t√© des Houll√®res et Fonderies de l'Aveyron. It lasted 108 days and drew national attention. The engineer Watrin was thrown out of a window and died. Duc-Quercy went to Decazeville to support the strike and to draw national attention to the social issues in his Cri de peuple. Ernest Roche also went, as did the socialist politicians Z√©phyrin Cam√©linat, Clovis Hugues and Antide Boyer. Duc-Quercy and Ernest Roche were charged by the police. The North American Review printed Henri Rochefort's account of the events, Duc-quercy and Ernest Roche R√©int√©gr√©... au nom de la radicanaillerie. From La Cravache illustr√©e, 10 May 1886 A different viewpoint was given in The Living Age, Roche was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment for participating in the organization of miner's strikes in Anzin, and particularly Decazeville. Henri Rochefort resigned from his seat as a deputy, triggering a by-election in which the socialists combined to nominate Roche as their candidate. Clemenceau decided not to support Roche, and instead sponsored Alfred Gaulier as the Radical candidate. Roche received over 100,000 votes, but Gaulier won the election. After the election Roche was returned to prison. He was pardoned after 6 months. Deputy for the Seine Boulangist deputies for the Seine Le Charivari, 1889. Roche is in the bottom right corner. Roche made several unsuccessful attempts in municipal and national elections before being chosen on 4 October 1889 as Deputy for the Seine for the 2nd constituency of the 17th arrondissement of Paris. In this election the Blanquists and Boulangists cooperated, dividing the electoral districts of Paris between the two parties. Roche won in the first round with 8,953 votes against 7,758 for the Republican candidate Edmond Lepelletier. In the chamber Roche supported the program of General Georges Ernest Boulanger and campaigned for revision of the constitution, abolition of the Senate, and the referendum. As a Blanquist revolutionary socialist he continued to fight for the amnesty and for abolition of the special courts. In his speeches he always supported the oppressed including the workers or those who suffered for their opinions or political actions. He was strongly opposed to the draft law restricting the freedom of the press. Roche contributed articles to the left-wing journals Le ralliement of Lyon from 1890 and Le r√©veil du peuple of Paris from 1892 to 1894. Roche was reelected on 20 August 1893 and 8 May 1898. In the last years of the 19th century several of the Blanquists moved to the Right, while retaining Jacobin ideals. Many of the supporters of Ernest Granger followed him into national socialism and the Ligue des Patriotes, a movement that Rochefort also supported. Roche was the effective leader of this faction of the Blanquists. He continued to call for worker's solidarity, but became increasingly nationalistic in his views. At the 1899 celebration of the anniversary of the Paris Commune, which Henri Rochefort and L'Intransigeant hosted, the speeches took an anti-Dreyfus theme in which Dreyfus was presented as a capitalist and a clerical. Roche made a speech in which he said, Ernest Roche in 1900 Roche said that Rochefort's leadership had prevented French socialism from being \\"domesticated and completely dishonored!\\" He ended with a toast to Blanqui in which he repeated the Jacobin slogan, \\"Neither God nor Master\\". Roche was again elected on 27 April 1902 on the Nationalist Republican platform, holding office until 31 May 1906. From 1903 he was a strong supporter of the law on separation of the church and the state. He founded the first \\"soup kitchen\\", created in the 17th arrondissement and from then subsidized by the Paris municipal council. In the 1906 elections he was defeated in the second round. He was elected Deputy for the Seine on 8 May 1910, holding office until 31 May 1914. In the elections of 26 April 1914 he was decisively beaten in the first round. Ernest Roche died in Paris on 27 December 1917. He is buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in the 85th division.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History Captain Aaron G. Peer was born in Dundas, Ontario, in 1812, and moved to Algonac, Michigan, in 1821. In 1833. Peer and his brother built a schooner and went in to the lake transport business, locating at the tip of Michigan's thumb. Peer also began a grindstone quarry at this site, and by 1850 was selling $3000 of grindstones a year. A second quarry was opened in the area, and eventually two large companies, the Lake Huron Stone Company and the Cleveland Stone Company, took over all operations in the area. By 1888, Grindstone City had a population of about 1500, and the two companies employed 200 men. Both companies rented houses to workmen and operated a company store. The grindstones were produces in a range of sizes, ranging from whetstones to three-ton stones. The companies operated until the Great Depression, which brought an end to operations. By the earl 1970s, only two buildings remained from the original operation, along with the remains of the quarries. Description The Grindstone City Historic District consists of about 250 acres of land, including quarry sites and two original buildings. At the time of nomination, there were no other buildings on the site, although subsequently a portion has been turned into a subdivision. Most of the quarry pits have been filled with rubble, and trees cover the operations. Two jetties extend out into Lake Huron. The two original buildings remaining are both stone structures. One is a two-story building measuring 28 feet by 50 feet, with a tablet on the facade reading \\"Built by Capt. A.G. Peer, 1884.\\" The other is a three-story former grain mill, with \\"Wallace Mills, 1887\\" along the roofline.

In 1605 her lease of the Seckford land was sub-let to a tailor cum innkeeper named Aaron Holland and to an actor named Martin Slater.

The event was a part of the 1996 Year End Sensation tour, which concluded with the Year End Spectacular event. The event marked the in- ring return of Atsushi Onita since his retirement at the 6th Anniversary Show and the retirement of Mr. Pogo as both men teamed up with Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda against the Funk Masters of Wrestling team of Terry Funk, Hisakatsu Oya and The Headhunters in a Texas Tornado Street Fight Deathmatch. Other predominant matches on the event were an interpromotional match between Hayabusa and The Great Sasuke, which Hayabusa won and a title unification match between The Gladiator and W*ING Kanemura for Gladiator's FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and Kanemura's FMW Independent Heavyweight Championship, which Gladiator won to unify both titles and both titles became collectively known as the FMW Double Championship. Background Mr. Pogo wrestled his retirement match at the Year End Spectacular event. At Summer Spectacular, Terry Funk defeated Mr. Pogo via knockout in a no rope barbed wire landmine match. Pogo had injured his neck when he fell into the exploding barbedwire after Funk blew fire on him. However, Pogo continued to wrestle and feud with the Puerto Rican Army. The Puerto Rican Army continued to grow in strength. On September 15, Lethal Weapon members Hisakatsu Oya and Horace Boulder turned on Ricky Fuji to join the Puerto Rican Army, forcing Lethal Weapon to end. Later in the main event, Hayabusa, Koji Nakagawa, Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda defeated Puerto Rican Army's Hisakatsu Oya, Super Leather and The Headhunters in a 20 million yen on a pole match to regain the yens which FMW had lost to the Puerto Rican Army at the 7th Anniversary Show. On September 24, Terry Funk and The Gladiator defeated Hayabusa and Tanaka and then Funk replaced the Puerto Rican Army to form his new group Funk Masters of Wrestling, seeking revenge on Atsushi Onita for beating him at the 4th Anniversary Show. On October 28, Pogo announced that he would retire at Year End Spectacular and begged his longtime rival Atsushi Onita to come out of retirement for only one match and team with him against the Funk Masters of Wrestling, but Onita refused.

Nakamura turned fan favorite and left Mad Dog Military and then changed her ring name to RIE in a match against Kudo on August 21. RIE began teaming with FMW's women's team to feud with her former Mad Dog Military teammates, heading to a match between the teams at Year End Spectacular. On November 16, Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling's (LLPW) Michiko Omukai lost to Mad Dog Military members Crusher Maedomari and Shark Tsuchiya in a handicap match. Later in the show, Megumi Kudo defeated RIE and then LLPW's Shinobu Kandori debuted in FMW and confronted Kudo as she was irate at Omukai's defeat and Omukai separated the two from brawling with each other. The confrontation set up a match between the two ladies at Year End Spectacular. Event =Preliminary matches= In the first match, Funk Masters of Wrestling members Super Leather and Crypt Keeper took on W*ING Alliance's Hideki Hosaka and Dragon Winger. Leather kicked the referee in the groin as the match began to use foreign objects. Near the end of the match, Leather performed a missile dropkick on Winger and performed a kneeling reverse piledriver to gain a near-fall. Leather followed with a brainbuster to win the match. RIE brought in Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling's (LLPW) Chikaro Shiratori as her tag team partner against Mad Dog Military (Shark Tsuchiya and Crusher Maedomari). Tsuchiya performed a Tsuchi Bomb on RIE to win the match. The Gladiator, the defending Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion defeated the Independent Heavyweight Champion W*ING Kanemura at the event to unify both titles. The FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and the FMW Independent Heavyweight Championship were put on the line in a title unification match to unify for both titles as the Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion The Gladiator took on the Independent Heavyweight Champion W*ING Kanemura. Mid-way through the match, Kanemura performed a diving splash on Gladiator through a wooden table taking the W*ING flag down with him. Near the end of the match, Gladiator performed an Awesome Bomb to get a near-fall. Gladiator attempted another but Kanemura slid out of it but Gladiator maintained his dominance by performing a short-arm lariat and then hit a wooden board on Kanemura's head and followed with an Awesome Bomb to win the match and unify the Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and the Independent Heavyweight Championship, making them the unified FMW Double Championship. Megumi Kudo took on LLPW's Shinobu Kandori. Kandori disrespected Kudo by pulling her hand out for Kudo to shake and then pulled it back and Kudo attacked her. Kandori performed an armbar on Kudo and worked on Kudo's arm during the earlier part of the match. After a back and forth match, Kudo attempted to perform a Kudo Driver on Kandori but Kandori overpowered her and then attempted to perform a Powerbomb but Kudo slipped out of it and charged at Kandori but Kandori choked her and Kudo was knocked out, with Kandori being awarded the match via referee stoppage. After the match, Kandori poured a bottle of water on Kudo's face as an insult. Atsushi Onita competed in his first FMW match at Year End Spectacular since his retirement at the FMW 6th Anniversary Show in 1995. Hayabusa took on Michinoku Pro Wrestling's (MPW) The Great Sasuke. Both men traded momentum with each other and Sasuke infuriated Hayabusa by kicking out of a pinfall attempt after a Firebird Splash. Sasuke made comeback into the match with a Sasuke Special 2 and a springboard moonsault. Near the end of the match, Sasuke attempted a missile dropkick on Hayabusa but Hayabusa dropkicked him in mid-air, knocking both men down to the mat. Sasuke attempted a Frankensteiner on Hayabusa from the top rope but Hayabusa countered it with a Falcon Arrow to win the match. =Main event match= Atsushi Onita came out of retirement to compete in his first FMW match in over a year by teaming with the retiring Mr. Pogo, Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda to represent FMW against Funk Masters of Wrestling's Terry Funk, Hisakatsu Oya, Headhunter A and Headhunter B in a Texas Tornado Street Fight Deathmatch. Both teams competed in the deathmatch wrestling style throughout the match. Near the end of the match, the FMW team gained momentum as Pogo grabbed a barbed wire baseball bat and began attacking the opposing team with it. Headhunter A attempted a moonsault on Tanaka but he countered it and hit a Rolling Elbow twice. Onita nailed a chair on the Headhunter and Tanaka performed a backdrop suplex to win the match. After the match, Hayabusa joined the winning FMW team in the ring and they celebrated and paid tribute to the retiring Pogo. Reception Stuart of Puroresu Central praised the event and the three main event matches were considered to be \\"really good matches\\" and each match having \\"its own style and focus.\\", with \\"The unification match had a great wrestling/garbage blend and was really choice. The third was a crazy spotfest with lots of \\"how did he...?\\" spots. The main event was just a total, whacked out insane brawl, FMW style. Lots of blood shed on the canvas and a great atmosphere. This is a good introduction to old school FMW, although the 5/5/96 show is probably better, since it had more matches. Good wrestling, good brawling.\\" Aftermath Megumi Kudo continued her feud with Shinobu Kandori after losing to her at Year End Spectacular. On January 5, 1997, Kandori defeated Kudo in a street fight at a LLPW show. The two competed again in a no ropes barbed wire deathmatch at a FMW show on March 14, which Kudo won. After the match, Kudo and Kandori shook hands to end the feud. Kudo lost her Women's Championship to Shark Tsuchiya on March 21, only to regain it in her retirement match at 8th Anniversary Show. Kudo's retirement also marked the first time that a women's match headlined the Anniversary Show event. Just like Atsushi Onita, Mr. Pogo broke his retirement vow as well. He joined FMW's rival deathmatch wrestling promotion Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW) on July 23, 1997 by defeating The Great Kojika. Pogo returned to FMW in 1998 as \\"The Great Pogo\\" to feud with Onita and their rivalry culminated in a match between the two on November 20, which Onita won to end their feud in FMW once and for all. This was the last match for both Onita and Pogo in FMW. The Gladiator continued his dominant reign as the FMW Double Champion after unifying the titles at Year End Spectacular. He successfully defended the title against Masato Tanaka on February 18, 1997, before Tanaka defeated Gladiator for the title at Fall Spectacular. As a result, Gladiator would become the longest reigning Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion and the longest reigning Independent Heavyweight Champion in FMW history.

In E. coli cells, CsgD is tasked with aiding the transition from planktonic cell motility to the stationary phase of biofilm formation, in response to environmental growth factors. A transcription analysis assay (happening in vitro) illustrated a heightened decrease in CsgD's DNA-binding capacity when phosphorylated at A.A. D59 of the protein's primary sequence. Therefore, in the protein's active form (unphosphorylated), CsgD is capable of carrying out its normal functions of regulating curli proteins (fimbria) and producing ECM polysaccharides (cellulose). Following a promoter-lacZ fusion assay of CsgD binding to specific target sites on E. coli's genome, two classes of binding targets were identified: group I genes and group II genes. The group I genes, akin to fliE and yhbT, exhibit repressed transcription following their interaction with CsgD, whilst group II genes, including yccT and adrA, illustrated active functionality. Other group I operons that illustrate repressed transcription include fliE and fliEFGH, for motile flagellum formation. Other group II genes, imperative to the transition towards stationary biofilm development, include csgBA, encoding for curli fimbriae, and adrA, encoding for the synthesis of cyclic diguanylate. In this context, c-di-GMP functions as a bacterial secondary messenger, enhancing the production of extracellular cellulose and impeding flagellum production and rotation.

Especially he used this method in the dedication in the Commentary on Romans. Calvin presented his own distinctive method of the hermeneutics of Scripture in his Commentary on the Epistle of Paul, the Apostle, to the Romans. It is called the ideal of brevitas et facilitas. Calvin was not satisfied with both Malanchthon's loci method and Bucer's prolixity commentary. He took a via media approach. Calvin's method was influenced by the rhetoric of Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian and Chrysostom. Calvin, however, confirmed that his own principle came from Scripture itself. Calvin showed that the clarity of Scripture was related to the ideal of brevitas et facilitas. According to John Bolt this means the brevitas et dilucidatio of Thomas Aquinas.The Outline of Bavinck's Reformed Dogmatics Method as Brevitas et Facilitas According to Michael Mewborn, Calvin did have a basic approach to Scripture which is often described as brevitas et facilitas (i.e. in derivative form-brevitas-to be brief and relevant and facilitas-to be simple or easily understood), brevitas for short. Brevitas is an assent to clear and concise interpretation. Even though the Latin terminology may paint Calvin's approach as irrelevant or archaic, the heart of this method is the basis of evangelical interpretation today. Richard Gamble writes of brevitas, ‚Äú[it] may be understood as an attempt to communicate the message of the biblical author in as concise, clear, and accurate a manner as possible‚Ä¶.‚Äù That brevitas et facilitas is a good summary of Calvin's exegetical methodology is hardly disputed; Battles, Kraus, Higman, Steinmetz, Girardin, Ganoczy/Scheld, and Parker among others have written recently about it.‚Äù Brevitas describes Calvin‚Äôs prevailing disposition toward interpretation. Calvin used this Method in his Commentaries. Richard Muller rightly notes that brevitas tended to describe more Calvin‚Äôs commentaries than his sermons. This point is well taken and suggests even more convincingly that brevitas characterizes Calvin‚Äôs approach to exegesis as he discerns biblical meaning in his study, apart from oratorical influence. Calvin was more apt to say less when writing than when speaking. Muller writes, ‚Äú...whereas the commentaries held to the model of brevitas, the sermons tended toward a more amplificatory model of oratory, often reaching three or four times the length of the comment on the same text. But less we assume that Calvin victimized the text or at least his interpretations by verbalizing in excess of textual warrant or study, Muller notes that during oratory he was, ‚Äúdrawing on more collateral texts for the sake of broader hortatory, topical, and polemical development.\\" It is a lesson to the exegete that the Holy Spirit does not dispense textual understanding only in our study rooms, but that he gives us textual understanding, even when we are without material aid. Source and Mention of Brevitas et Facilitas For Calvin Scripture was not complicated, but simple. Scripture was simply the eloquent speech of the Holy Spirit for his simple people. Therefore, to vitiate the simplicity of Scripture was to destroy the whole of 273 THE IDEAL OF Scripture. For Calvin the simplicity of Scripture was immediately connected with his hermeneutical method. This supplied Calvin with the foundation for the principles of brevitas et Jacilitas as his hermeneutical ideal. Calvin believed that Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel employed a simple and easy style in order for ordinary people to understand God's Word more easily. This made him believe that the style of Scripture had its orientation in brevitas et facilitas. Consequently, Calvin, influenced by rhetoricians like Cicero and Quintilian in his ideal of brevitas et facilitas, confirmed that the authors of Scripture demonstrated this ideal. Calvin made this ideal a part of his own hermeneutical method.https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/20883/Ahn_Ideal%281999%29.pdf?sequence=1 Myung 1un Ahn , \\"The Ideal of Brevitas et Facilitas: The Theological Hermeneutics of John Calvin \\", ISSN 0257-8891 = SKRIF EN KERK Jrg 20(2) 1999, 273-274 In the dedication in the Commentary on Romans published in 1540 to Simon Grynaeus his friend and Hebrew teacher, John Calvin says \\"we both thought that the chief excellency of an expounder consists in lucid brevity. And, indeed, since it is almost his only work to lay open the mind of the writer whom he undertakes to explain, the degree in which he leads away his readers from it, in that degree he goes astray from his purpose, and in a manner wanders from his own boundaries. Hence we expressed a hope, that from the number of those who strive at this day to advance the interest of theology by this kind of labour, some one would be found, who would study plainness, and endeavour to avoid the evil of tiring his readers with prolixity. I know at the same time that this view is not taken by all, and that those who judge otherwise have their reasons; but still I cannot be drawn away from the love of what is compendious. But as there is such a variety, found in the minds of men, that different things please different persons, let every one in this case follow his own judgment, provided that no one attempts to force others to adopt his own rules. Thus it will be, that we who approve of brevity, will not reject nor despise the labours of those who are more copious and diffused in their explanations of Scripture, and that they also in their turn will bear with us, though they may think us too compressed and concise.John Calvin, \\"THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY JOHN CALVIN TO SIMON GRYN√ÜUS,\\" Commentary on Romans, Christian Classics Ethereal Library \\"Sentiebat enim uterque nostrum praecipuam interpretis virtutem in perspicua brevitate esse positam.

A former assistant to Helen Frankenthaler, Kenneth Noland, and Larry Poons, Saito's work infuses richly saturated colorscapes with delicately drawn lines. Saito was the creator of sui generis theatre and dance events, collaborating with innovative directors and choreographers Robert Wilson, Peter Brook, Jerome Robbins, and dancer and choreographer Eva Maier, to whom he was married for several decades. His productions combined wordless drama in the poetic frameworks of light, costumes, music, and dance, most of which he devised and directed himself. Early life and education Kikuo Saito was born in Tokyo in 1939. He began painting when he was 17 years old, and worked for 3 years as a proctor and studio technician at the workshop of Sensei Itoh, an established Japanese painter. During this time, Saito gained an understanding of both the traditional arts of Japan as well as contemporary movements such as the Gutai Group. He also had an interest in the burgeoning New York City art world and movements such as Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, Color Field, and Pop Art. Saito moved to New York in 1966 at the age of 27. The journey across the United States to New York provided him a chance meeting with Ellen Stewart, founder of La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, whom he would later describe as his American mother. Once in New York, Saito worked with Stewart at La MaMa and was instrumental in bringing Japanese avant-garde dramatist Shuji Terayama to La MaMa in 1980. In his early years in New York, Saito balanced painting with theatre, supporting himself with carpentry and working on loft build-outs in Soho. Career =Painting= Island and Piano, oil on canvas The composition of many of Saito's paintings was significantly influenced by and in dialogue with the geography of his theatre productions. Saito's dualistic nature took material form in the interplay between the collaborative theatre and the private realm of the painting studio. Art critic Karen Wilkin wrote that \\"if we are attentive, we discover that characters from his stage pieces have been reincarnated as abstract configurations within his paintings, reborn as the records of animated gestures that retain the individuality of their sources.\\" A commonality in the entire body of Saito's work, both on stage or on canvas, focuses on written signs. Repeated investigations of alphabet in Saito's work, both real and made-up, legible and obscured, speak to moments in his personal history. As a young immigrant in a country whose language he did not speak, Saito wrote space for himself in the already-established Color Field tradition by constructing his own painterly lexicon. Opposing motifs of free gestural brushtrokes and elegant, ordered lettering allude again to his double practice as painter and architect of poetic performance. Abstraction in Saito's work points to a meditation on the instabilities and impermanence of language and the mutability of meaning. A space opens once departing from structuralist systems of transmuting signs, and Saito fills that space with vibrant color. =Theatre= Indian Gray, 2006 Saito worked with actors and dancers, devising, directing, and creating the decor and costumes for stage performances, sometimes collaborating with Wilson, Brook, and Maier. He drew inspiration from Japanese theatrical traditions of Kabuki and Noh plays, and was an innovator with water and other nontraditional materials onstage. He designed sets for numerous productions at La MaMa and for the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. He collaborated with Wilson on projects in Shiraz, Iran, and in Paris created the set for Brook's Conference of the Birds. In 1966 he was the artist-in-residence at Duke University, where in collaboration with Maier he created the conceptual, wordless performance Toy Garden, which would later be performed at La MaMa. Saito said Toy Garden was about what he imagined in the missing half of Vittore Carpaccio's painting \\"Two Venetian Ladies,\\" a work with a famously-missing left side. Exhibitions Dime Lake, 2015 Saito had his first solo exhibition at Deitcher O'Reilly Gallery on 67th Street in 1976. He would go on to exhibit both solo and group shows in the United States, Europe, and Japan. He is represented in collections in the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, and numerous private collections. An exhibition called \\"The Final Years\\", featuring work made in the year leading up to Saito's death, opened at the Leslie Feely Fine Art Gallery on East 68th Street in New York City from September 15 - October 14, 2016. In 2014, Saito and his partner Mikiko Ino purchased the former St. Patrick's School property in Verplanck, New York and recommissioned it as KinoSaito, a multidisciplinary nonprofit museum and art space projected to open to the public in 2020 Selected museum collections *Modern and Contemporary Art  The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston *The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut *Nasher Museum of Art, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina *Art Gallery of Alberta, Alberta, Canada *Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery, Ontario, Canada *The Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York *Museum of Art, Fort Lauderdale, Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, Florida *Queens University, Ontario, Canada *John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida *Peter Stuyvesant Foundation, Netherlands *Ulster Museum, Northern Ireland *University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada Theatrical productions *1965 setting for modern dance, an early collaborations with Toshiro Ogawa Lighting Designer at Waseda University, Tokyo *1966 setting for modern dance with LD Toshiro Ogawa, Iino Hall, Tokyo *1967 set designed for Tom Eyen's Sara B.

The shooter, 21-year- old William Atchison, a former student at the school, killed two students in a hallway, then went inside a classroom where students had barricaded themselves in a small office area and fired several rounds before continuing on down the hall where he finally committed suicide as police approached his location.  Shooting  William Atchison walked into Aztec High School disguised as a student and armed with a handgun. He opened fire in the upper level hallway of the 800-900 building. The school custodian, Thomas \\"Emery\\" Hill, chased after the gunman shouting \\"active shooter,\\" \\"lock down!\\" Katie Potter, a 74-year-old substitute teacher, heard the gunshots and the following loudspeaker announcement calling for a lock-down. As a substitute teacher Ms. Potter did not have keys to the classroom, so she ushered her 17 students into the classroom office and barricaded the door with a couch. Atchison fired multiple rounds through the office wall and then shot himself. San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christensen credited her swift action with saving many lives. Two students were confirmed dead, along with the shooter. State authorities confirmed that there were no other injuries reported. Officials said that Aztec police received a call about the shooting about 8:00 a.m. Students were in class at the time, and heard what they thought was someone punching the lockers. As the noise became louder, they realized it was gunfire. Teachers and students hid in locked classrooms until they were told by officials to walk out of the room toward the back of the building and the parking lot; they were later picked up by their parents at McGee Park.  Victims  Casey Jordan Marquez, a senior, and Francisco \\"Paco\\" Fernandez, a junior, were identified as the victims. Both were student-athletes at Aztec High School. Marquez was a cheerleader and Fernandez, a recent transfer to the school, played football.  Perpetrator  William Edward Atchison (March 18, 1996 ‚Äì December 7, 2017) lived in Aztec, New Mexico with his father, and was a former student at Aztec High School. He dropped out of high school before graduation and worked at a local gas station. When Atchison entered Aztec High School on December 7, 2017 at approximately 8:04 a.m., he was \\"disguised as a student\\" and carrying a backpack with a 9mm Glock 19 Gen4 semi-automatic pistol inside. Atchison had no criminal record; however, he was investigated by the FBI in March 2016 due to posts he had made online indicating that he was interested in purchasing weapons to carry out a mass shooting. He came to the attention of the FBI when he asked on an internet forum \\"where to find cheap assault rifles for a mass shooting.\\" Atchison told FBI investigators that he was simply trolling, and the investigation was closed when it was determined that he did not own a gun. Atchison subsequently purchased the pistol used in the attack in November, 2017. Atchison's online activity included posting pro-Hitler forums and websites, under such usernames as \\"Future Mass Shooter\\" and \\"Adam Lanza,\\" and joking about school shootings, in particular the Columbine High School massacre. Via a Steam chat group he was in contact with the perpetrator of the 2016 Munich shooting. He also posted about his frustration with life in rural New Mexico and bleak career prospects. Atchison called his father a \\"fat lazy idiot who watches Fox News all day\\" and his mother \\"a psycho hillbilly drunk from Florida who's really mentally ill.\\" A schedule for the killings was found at Atchison's home, with the last entry being \\"8[a.m.] Die.\\" A thumb drive discovered on his person contained the same schedule.

Mating in midshipman fish depends on auditory communication, the production and reception of sound signals. Males produce several different vocalizations, while females only make grunts in non-breeding situations. Calling Typical Type I male calls are divided into short grunts that last for milliseconds or are produced in a series of grunts called a \\"grunt train\\", mid-duration growls, and long duration advertisement hums that can last up to an hour. These calls can be recorded naturally. They can also be produced in a laboratory, a procedure known as \\"fictive calling\\". In nature, two muscles contracting on the swim bladder produce these sounds. In the laboratory, sounds are produced by a stimulating electrode placed on the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and a recording electrode placed on the occipital nerve that leads to the sonic muscles of the fish. Steroid mediation The vocalizations of male midshipman fish are androgen and estradiol steroid mediated. There are high blood levels of these hormones during the transition from non-calling to calling before midshipman breeding season, suggesting that higher hormone levels are needed for making advertisement calls. Feeding 11-ketotestosterone coated scallops to toadfish increases their calling behavior, which identifies 11-ketotestosterone, an androgen hormone, as a mediator of midshipman fish vocalization. There are also high levels of aromatase, an estrogen-generating enzyme, in the hindbrain vocal motor region. Estradiol steroids and their receptors are present in the same areas already concluded to be involved in male midshipman calling. There are three genders of midshipman fish: females, type I males, and type II males. Type I and type II males have different reproductive strategies, and can be distinguished from each other based on physical characteristics. Type I males are eight times larger in body mass, and have much larger vocal organs. Type II males‚Äô reproductive organs are seven times larger in size than those of type I males. Female and type II male midshipman fish can be distinguished from each other by the female's slightly larger size, and the type II male midshipman's large reproductive organs. The three genders of midshipman fish have different steroid-mediated reproductive behaviors. Type I territorial males use vocalizations via paired muscles in the swimming bladder to attract females, while type II males invest in larger reproductive organs. Type II males then ‚Äúsneak‚Äù into nests because they look much like females and fertilize laid eggs. This behavior is referred to as cuckoldry or satellite-spawning. Type II males and females are incapable of long duration calls. 11-Ketotestosterone is the major steroid present in Type I males‚Äô vocalization systems, while Type 2 males‚Äô and females‚Äô vocalizations are primarily mediated by testosterone. The specific mechanisms by which these steroids act are still unknown. The sounds produced by male midshipman fish cause reproductive females to develop a hormone-mediated selective sensitivity to this sound, and they respond by laying eggs in the rock nest of a singing male. This selective sensitivity to higher frequency correlates to increased levels of testosterone and estradiol. Neuron connectivity The neuronal pathway for midshipman vocalization starts at the ventral medullary nucleus and continues to a hindbrain vocal pattern generator, which contains both pre- pacemaker and pacemaker nuclei. For each action potential fired in their vocal pattern generator, there is exactly one sonic motor neuron that fires, and there is exactly one sound pulse. The two motor nuclei fire in phase in toadfish, leading to the paired contraction of the sonic muscles. The duration of calls is controlled by the pre-pacemaker neurons in the hindbrain. The duration is encoded by a long depolarization of these pre-pacemaker neurons. Exposing pacemaker neurons to different levels of the anesthetic lidocaine alters the duration of the calls, but not the frequency Pacemaker neurons code for the frequency of signals using \\"ultrafast\\" rhythmic oscillations in membrane potential. As midbrain stimulus increased, the oscillations increased in amplitude. Implications for humans Although midshipman fish have been known to wake houseboat owners, research surrounding their vocalizations could be beneficial to humans. Midshipman fish are model organisms for studying both human speech and hearing. Recently, it was found that midshipman fish can decrease their own hearing sensitivity by stiffening their inner ear hair cells while they are vibrating their calling muscles. This behavior is also found in bats, and may lead to an understanding a similar mechanism humans use to turn down their ear sensitivity to retain their hearing longer. There are conserved patterns of vocal, auditory, and neuroendocrine mechanisms between teleosts and tetrapods, which include midshipman fish and humans, respectively. This model organisms‚Äô simple system could lead to a deeper understanding of human speech and auditory pathways,. This evolutionary connection could be important in modern medicine because these fish have homologous brain structures to humans. An example is for patients with lesions in the brain that become mute after having a stroke. On August 9, 1974, composer Charlie Morrow performed a concert for fish using what he understood to be decoded toadfish language, similar to his decoded field peeper language. Morrow observed that choruses of multiple toadfish shift leadership based on call and response by strong individuals. He notated the patterns for human performance, in one version numbering each individual for identification and spatial location. The night before, Richard Nixon resigned as U.S. president. Major media covered the concert. New York Times music critic, John Rockwell, wrote a review with the headline, \\"Fish Silent\\".  Brain-behavior relationship  Midshipman fish have two forms of males: the nest-building Type I and \\"sneaker male\\" or \\"satellite male\\" Type II. Type I males attract females to their nests with their humming, coax them to lay eggs, and guard them. In contrast, Type II males do not build nests or attract females on their own. Instead, they sneak up to the Type I's nests and deposit their eggs. These behavioral differences can be seen in the differences in the structure and function of the nervous system. = Morph-specific vocal behavior =  Neurons and Muscles  Type I males and Type II males and females grow along different growth paths when it comes to neurons and muscles that determine morph-specific vocal behavior. For Type I males, for example, sexual maturation is preceded by growth of the mate-calling circuit and sonic muscle. Specifically, before the transformation from juvenile to type I male, the size of the motoneurons and volume of the sonic motor nucleus increases twofold and the number of sonic muscle fibers increases fourfold. At the start of sexual maturation, the motoneurons increase in size again, although not as much as before. The pacemaker neurons also increase in size at this time but not as much as the motoneurons in general. The sonic muscle also increases fivefold in the size of muscle fibers. In contrast, there is little dramatic change seen before the transformation from juvenile to type II male or adult female. In fact, the vocal neurons and muscles change little or not at all.  Hormones  Differences between the reproductive strategies of Type I and Type II are also reflected in hormonal differences during sexual maturation. The three different morphs ‚Äì Type I, Type II, and females ‚Äì also produce different levels of various hormones. Type II males produce the highest levels of testosterone, followed by females and then Type I males. Females only have estrogen in the form of 17Œ≤-estradiol but at much lower levels than testosterone. Type I males also have five times more 11-ketotestoterone, which is a form of testosterone common to teleosts, than type II males and females. 11-ketotestosterone is likely to be more potent than testosterone in supporting courtship behaviors such as humming.

It formed within the Tengger Desert during the Pleistocene and in reduced form during the Holocene as well. It is not certain when it existed.  Hydrology  Lake Tengger was a moderately deep () lake. At an water level elevation of it would have been about four times larger than China's present-day largest inland lake, Lake Qinghai, covering a surface of . Overall, during the late Pleistocene lake levels alternated between above sea level. Beach deposits and cliffs developed at its margins, the former of which in part show up as dark bars in Landsat imagery. Waters ranged from fresh to mesohaline and were resupplied by precipitation and from neighbouring mountains, with the Shiyang He being a principal river flowing into the lake. The formation of this lake was directed by a climate very different from the one that can be observed today.  Geography  Lake Tengger formed in northwestern China, northwest of Lanzhou, in Inner Mongolia and the Gansu Province. It is located in the Tengger Desert, which is the fourth largest desert in China and covers a surface of , containing sand dunes. Presently, average temperatures amount to and rainfall to ; vegetation exists mainly in places where groundwater is not deep beneath the surface and consists of grasses and shrubs. The precipitation is mainly brought by the East Asian Monsoon in summer. Geologically, the area is covered by sediments of Quaternary age and sedimentary rocks of Mesozoic- Tertiary age, with outcrops of Precambrian-Paleozoic age in mountains. The Shiyang River after a steep descent over tectonically tilted terrain flows into the Tengger Desert and enters into lake Baijian Hu. The average runoff of the Shiyang River is ; water is withdrawn for irrigation purposes and this has reduced river discharge in the Tengger Desert, causing lakes to dry up.  Biology  A number of ostracods inhabited Lake Tengger or its margins, such as Candona candida, Candona compressa, Cyprideis torosa, Darwinula stevensoni, Eucypris, Heterocypris salina, Iiyocypris gibba and Limnocythere inopinata. Animals found within fluvial fans and terraces at the edge of Lake Tengger are Corbicula fluminea, Cubicula largillerti and Gyraulus sinensis. Furthermore, archeological relics have been found on the shores of the Holocene lakes, including ceramics and arrowhead microliths. Vegetation around the lake included Cupressaceae, Larix, Picea, Populus and Quercus. Such vegetation occurred in particular on Yabulai Mountain in the western portion of the Tengger Desert; today no vegetation occurs there and only desert species at lower elevations.  History  The chronology of the lake has seen different dating proposals, owing to uncertainties in dating methods. According to earlier reports, the lake first appeared between 40,000 - 42,000 years before present and reached maximum size between 35,000 and 22,000 years before present, all in C14 dates. According to this theory, Lake Tengger formed together with other lakes in the Badanjilin Desert and the Qilian Mountains between 35,000 - 22,000 years before present. At that time Lake Tengger would have reached its highest stand, the eastern part of the Tengger Desert was covered with smaller lakes. At the same time as Lake Tengger reached maximum levels, lake levels rose also in Tibet and northern Xinjiang. The formation of these lakes in the lowlands has been explained with the glacial climate, which reduced evaporation without decisively lowering temperatures and increased meridional temperature gradients which resulted in stronger baroclinic storms. Later, it is possible that a weakening of the East Asian Monsoon caused the lakes to dry up during full glacial conditions. Later obtained optically stimulated luminescence dates have however shown that maximum lake levels occurred between 100,000 - 70,000 years before present. Radiocarbon dates implying younger ages may be due to contamination with younger carbon and/or the fact that the dates obtained are fairly borderline for radiocarbon dating precision. Lake Tengger shrank or disappeared somewhere before the last glacial maximum, seeing as no lakes existed during that time in the desert. After 12,000 years before present lakes developed anew in the Tengger Desert. Lakes also formed during the Holocene, but they covered smaller surface areas and their positions were variable. There are again uncertainties in the dates, also because different areas in the whole East Asia domain appear to have wet periods at separate times; it is possible that different meteorological mechanisms controlled precipitation in different regions. Changes in summer insolation over the course of the Holocene mediated a weakening of the monsoon and drying of the Tengger Desert after about 5,000 years before present. The present-day Baijian Hu lake is a salt swamp, and other playas and salt lakes are found in the region.

Created in 1987 as an affiliate of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and headquartered in Chicago, NEF is one of the largest non-profit LIHTC syndicators in the United States of America. History National Equity Fund, Inc. was founded by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation to be one of the first LIHTC syndicators, following the creation of LIHTC in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. LIHTC provides investors in affordable housing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in federal taxes in exchange for equity in new or refurbished affordable housing projects. Because tax credits are typically awarded to developers, rather than investors, syndicators like National Equity Fund were created to package tax credits in large pools for investors. In 2004, LISC created the New Markets Support Company to replicate NEF‚Äôs success using the newly created New Markets Tax Credit Program (NMTC), which supports business development in low-income areas. Impact Since 1987, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit has become the most important resource for creating affordable housing in the United States, responsible for more than three million units of affordable housing. NEF has invested over $16.75 billion in 2,494 housing developments, creating 158,907 affordable homes since its founding in 1987. In 2019 alone, NEF invested $1.45B in 108 housing projects. A 2017 study from the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University found that LIHTC-supported housing units like those created by NEF revitalize low-income neighborhoods, reduce crime and afford their residents access to better schools than other forms of housing assistance. Notable projects =Veterans Housing= In 2012, LISC and NEF joined national efforts to end Veteran homelessness by launching the Bring Them Homes campaign. The campaign has created more than 4,000 residences in 15 states that provide permanent supportive housing for formerly homeless Veterans. Bring Them Homes developments include The Six, a LEED-platinum certified support housing project with 18 units set aside for veterans living in Los Angeles‚Äô Skid Row. =Native American Supportive Housing= NEF supported the Cedar Crossing affordable housing project developed by Native American Connections in Phoenix, Arizona. Cedar Crossing pioneered transit-accessible affordable housing in Phoenix with a special emphasis on meeting the needs of the Native American Community. =LGBTQ+= As affordable housing developers began creating projects focused on the needs of LGBTQ and LGBTQ seniors, NEF became an early supporter of projects including Town Hall Apartments in Chicago and Evergreen Lofts in Buffalo.

Although born in Eastbourne, Bruford was an active participant in several of the artist groups based in Cornwall throughout her adult life. Biography Bruford was born in Eastbourne and attended Badminton School in the Clifton area of Bristol. There she became friends with Mornie Birch, one of the daughters of the Cornwall artist Lamorna Birch. This connection led Bruford to taking art classes at Forbes School of Painting in Newlyn during the 1920s. Later, Bruford took art lessons from other artists based in Newlyn including Ernest Procter and Harold Harvey and also studied under Lamorna Birch in the 1930s. For a time Bruford lived at Treveneth near Paul before spending time studying in Paris and later lived in a cottage between Paul and Mousehole. Bruford mainly painted portraits and landscapes and was the subject of several portraits by Dod Proctor. Bruford and the Cornish artist Richard Weatherby (1881‚Äì1953) lived together at Mullion Cove in the late 1920s but although at one point they were engaged they never married. During her artistic career Bruford exhibited at the Newlyn Art Gallery during the 1920s, at the Goupil Gallery in London, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, with the New English Art Club and the Society of Women Artists. Bruford was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy, in total having some thirty-two works accepted for display there between 1924 and 1955.

It was an amateur-built, low- powered, single seat parasol wing machine. Only one was completed. Design and development Brothers Pawel and Jan Gabriel became interested in aviation in their youth and by 1913 had built and tried to fly four gliders. During the later part of World War I they worked in the Rumpler factory, initially in the repair department. Later Pawel later joined the design team and Jan learned to fly. At the end of the war they returned to Poland and in 1920 began the design of their first powered aircraft, the P 5, which consciously followed the layout of the Fokker D.VIII. Their father owned a furniture factory in Bydgoszcz and provided them with space and tools. The P 5 had an approximately rectangular plan wing apart from blunted tips and was built in one piece around twin spars with plywood covering. The ailerons were fabric covered. Originally there was a flap in the central trailing edge to ease access to the cockpit. The wing was braced to the fuselage on each side with a parallel pair of steel tube struts from the lower longeron to each spar. From the top of the forward member of the pair one shorter strut reached back to the upper longeron below the trailing edge and another went forward to the engine mounting at mid-fuselage height. The P 5 was powered by a air-cooled flat twin Haacke HFM-2 driving a propeller designed by the brothers and mounted within a metal cowling with its cylinder heads exposed for cooling. Behind the engine and its fuel tank the fuselage structure was rectangular in section and was ply covered, flat-sided apart from rounded decking. The open, single cockpit was under the access flap in the trailing edge. The P 5's tailplane, with balanced elevators, was mounted on top of the fuselage and braced from below with a V-strut on each side. The fin was small and semi-circular in profile with a larger balanced rudder which reached down to the keel. The rudder and elevators were originally fabric covered. Its fixed landing gear had large mainwheels on a single axle, supported via rubber cord shock absorbers by steel V-struts at either end. There was a tall, sprung tailskid at the rear. The P 5 was completed in June 1921 and moved to the local flying school's airfield where Jan Gabriel took it on its first flight early in September. This was the first flight of an aircraft nationally designed and built in independent Poland. Further flying proved acceptable handling and decent performance. The winter break was used to make some modifications. The rear control surfaces were re-covered with plywood instead of the original fabric to prevent flutter. Access to the cockpit was improved by replacing the trailing edge flap with a semi-circular cut-out which reduced the wing area by . Alterations were also made to make it easier to transport the P 5 by road with its wing demounted and re-attached above the fuselage. This required a new, detachable transverse steel tube between the forward spar struts and a pair of outward-leaning struts to support the wingtip ahead of the fin. In flight these components were stored in a new luggage locker behind the pilot. After the modifications the aircraft was referred to as the P 5a. The P 5a was flown regularly in 1922 and 1923 at Bydgoszcz, both by the Gabriels and by military pilots from the flying school there, logging up about 180 hours. The brothers tried to interest the Department of Aerial Navigation in its serial production but had no success. By 1923 the sole P 5 was in need of an overhaul but was instead scrapped.

The first tunnel was built in 1835 and has now become a pedestrian route through to the North York Moors Railway (NYMR) engine sheds on the south side of the hill. The original tunnel was superseded by a new bore in the 1840s that was sited immediately west of the old tunnel. The 1830s tunnel is now the only original structure built by the Whitby & Pickering Railway (W&P;) that is under the care of the NYMR. History The first tunnel was started in 1834 and completed in 1835. It was located on the initial stretch of the horse operated W&P; which had reached a point that was known as just 'Tunnel', which became known as Grosmont by 1894.The village name was taken from the Grandmontine priory that was located near to the village that was known as Growmond. The monks who founded the priory who had come from Grandimont in Normandy. Initially, services only ran between Whitby and Grosmont (Tunnel) as the tunnel was still being constructed when the horse tramway opened. The Tunnel Inn was built in the village to accommodate passengers (though the grade II listed building is now known by the name of The Station Tavern and is one of the first permanent surviving structures built by the Whitby & Pickering Railway). Not many of the structures from the original Whitby & Pickering Railway exist, and the Horse Tunnel is the only one which is maintained by the NYMR. The first tunnel, which is long, is sometimes referred to as Grosmont Old Tunnel or as the Horse Tunnel as the initial railway was a horse operated tramway. Both bores tunnel under Lease Rigg, a hill just south of Grosmont which when the first tunnel was excavated, was found to contain iron ore. Various kilns sprung up in the area to exploit the mineral commercially. The Horse Tunnel is castellated at its northern portal but plainer at the southern end. In his book, The North Yorkshire Moors Railway, Michael Vanns states that in the early days of railway building, such castellations were significant of the railway company's individuality and also to assure passengers of the safety of the structure they were about to enter. The Horse Tunnel is believed to have been designed and built by George Stephenson, who was the overall engineer for the whole route from Whitby to Pickering. Because of its early construction date, it is reputed to be the oldest castellated tunnel in England and also one of the oldest passenger railway tunnels in England. When the railway was upgraded to steam locomotion in the 1840s by the York and North Midland Railway (Y&NMR;), the Horse Tunnel was not big enough to accommodate trains, so a longer tunnel, long, was constructed to the west and was double track throughout. The original tunnel was retained to allow access to the workman's cottages on the south side of the tunnel. It was designed by John Cass Birkenshaw (the then architect for the Y&NMR;), was grade II listed in 1989 and is still used by trains on the NYMR. When the railway was re-opened as a heritage concern in 1973, the Horse Tunnel was used as an access point to the NYMR engine sheds which are located at the southern portal of both tunnels. The Horse Tunnel is now grade II* listed and is still in use as a thoroughfare to allow visitors to the NYMR access to viewing areas around the engine sheds. In the 2016 autumn gala on the NYMR, temporary track was laid through the tunnel to a gauge, thereby allowing steams trains to work through the Horse Tunnel for the first time in its 180-year history.

These ceremonies had theatrical elements, but whether or not these traditions are early forms of modern-day theatre or are independent cultural practices is not clear. According to Henry Schafer, ‚ÄúA variety of rituals and ceremonies could be considered early forms of theatre‚Ä¶. Others see this interpretation as a devaluation of sacred rituals as simply a pre-form of secular theatre.‚Äù One of the first practitioners of Native Theatre was a Mohawk poet named Emily Pauline Johnson, who performed dramatic readings of her poems in the late nineteenth century. Other early contributors to the Native Canadian Theatre scene included a non-native named Anthony Walsh who directed the ‚ÄúCan-Oos-Sez Skay-loo Drama Group,‚Äù from 1934 to 1942, and Emily General (Cayuga), who established a series of annual plays to be performed at the Great Pine Forest Theatre on the Six Nations Reserve in 1949. In 1950, two non-Natives, Frank Morrison and Cecil West wrote and directed the opera Tzinquaw: The Thunderbird and the Killer Whale, which premiered in Duncan, BC, performed by purely Native people. In Canada, playwrights James Reaney, John Herbert, and George Ryga made their contribution to Native theatre with The Ecstasy of Rita Joe (1970). Margo Kane (Saulteaux/Cree/Blackfoot) joined the production of The Ecstasy of Rita Joe in 1978 and became the first Native American actor to play the part of Rita Joe in 1981. According to Henry Schafer, 1985-1995 was the ‚ÄúGolden Age‚Äù of Native Theatre. Many Native Theatre companies and playwrights emerged during this period. Tomson Highway (Cree) joined the Native Earth Performing Arts (NEPA), starting as a musical director and performer. In 1985, Ondinnok Mythological Theatre was founded in Montreal by French-speaking Native playwright Yves Sioui Durand. Other Native Theatre companies that emerged during this period were: Tunooniq Theater, Awasikan Theatre, Urban Shaman and Native Youth Theatre R-Street Vision. In 1987, on the Hobbema Reserve, Four Winds Theatre Group was founded by Darrel and Lori Wildcat (Cree), along with cofounders Rosa and Melvin John. After the Four Winds Theatre Group closed in 1991, the Johns went on to form Kehewin Native Performance Resource Network (KNPRN). ‚ÄúKNPRN concentrates on traditional theatre, storytelling, and dance and works with young people, touring all over Canada and internationally.‚Äù (1) In 1992, Margo Kane founded Full Circle: First Nations Performance in British Columbia. Two of the most recent Native Theatre companies to emerge are Saskatchewan Native Theatre Company (1999) and Red Sky Performance in Toronto (2000). From 1995 to present day Native Theatre has struggled to maintain its size and popularity. One major issue the Native Theatre scene faced was lack of funding. Although some of the theatre companies closed and some still struggle to survive, the Native Theatre scene is continuing to develop and mature. ‚ÄúEven though Native theatre is a relatively recent phenomenon in Canada, it is by now an integral part of the Canadian cultural landscape. It takes on many forms and draws from various traditions like storytelling, European theatre, traditional dance, and multimedia. It resists any clear-cut definition and is constantly exploring new forms of expression.‚Äù The stories that inspire Native American Theatre have been around for hundreds of years, but did not gain formal recognition by colonial America. This lack of recognition lasted until the 1930s when Lynn Riggs, a playwright of Cherokee descent, brought Native Theatre into the spotlight through the Six Nations Reserve Forest Theatre in Ontario. Through these events, Native Theatre has been introduced to mainstream society and contemporary Native American Theater was born. Canadian playwright Drew Hayden Taylor explains how Native American theatre has been around for centuries, but has only recently been highlighted in North American mainstream media: ‚ÄúNative Theatre is much older than the scant few years. It is as old as this country, as old as the people who have been here for thousands of years, as old as the stories that are still told today. It is merely the presentation that has changed.‚Äù Since the creation of contemporary Native American Theater, there have been plays available for publishing: ‚ÄúThere are currently over 250 published and far over 600 unpublished plays by some 250 Native American and First Nations playwrights and theatre groups on the North American market.‚Äù These numbers do not include the plays inside the North American Indian Drama collection as of 2006. Even though there is a large amount of plays available for production or analysis, the Native American drama genre is often overlooked by not only the general public, but also by universities. Shari Huhndorf states ‚Äúdrama remains the most overlooked genre in Native American literature.‚Äù There needs to be more research and appreciation for Native American drama and its background. The lack of connection between plays from reservations and urban areas needs to improve in order for there to be more information from different angles and perspectives presented through dramatic literature. This can provide increased appreciation for Native American Theatre. Contemporary Native American theater began in the 20th century and developed from oral culture and literature. These stories were used to ‚Äúeducate, entertain, and preserve‚Äù the new generations of the Native Americans. ‚ÄúHowever, indigenous theater was absent in Native writing during this period and the multiple reasons given for this nonexistence usually reflect a long history of silencing, discrimination, oppression, and displacement exercised in the genre.‚Äù These stories were usually told orally in a way accompanied by dancing, music, and other performances while the storyteller gets close to the audience to give them an immersive encounter of the story and the storyteller. These stories were usually exaggerated to give more drama for the audience. ‚ÄúThis existence of this vibrant oral literature contrasts with the traditional Western conception that Native American cultures did not have history.‚Äù A non-Western historical record gave the misconception of Native Americans having no history before the arrival of European immigrants. Many Native American traditions and customs were suppressed due to colonization which prevented many from being able to tell their stories while they were oppressed. ‚ÄúThe rise of the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s and the 1970s also contributed to this reawakening of Native cultures since it appeared as a movement in which minorities demanded an end to discrimination and the right to speak for themselves.‚Äù This gave pride and encouraged many to seek inspiration from history and ancestral roots. Today there are many theater productions performing Native American works.  Characteristics  According to Rolland Meinholtz, who is an ‚Äúinstructor and artistic director of drama and dance at the Institute of American Indian Arts,‚Äù youth must understand the struggles of Native American culture through contemporary plays. ‚ÄúThey needed to know it, understand it, deal with it, struggle with it, hopefully integrate it, and lastly, build upon it.‚Äù In order to produce a play to convey a Native American themed message, you need dance, verse, drums, masks, facial painting. Even when the play consisted of non-Native Americans, Native American drama is all about the story and presentation, not about those who play the roles. ‚ÄúNevertheless, there could be absolutely no question whose theatre we were witnessing. The spare setting, the drumming, the chanting and singing, the dancing, its episodic nature, and its wry point of view all proudly proclaimed this was Indian Theatre.‚Äù Coyote is a metaphor to describe the character of Native American theater. Native American Theater production that does not fit into western conventions cannot easily be categorized as comedy or tragedy. Thus, the coyote trickster represents the shape shifting nature of Native Theater itself. ‚ÄúFor Indian theatre, there is no clear division of comedy and tragedy as found, for example, in ancient Greek drama. Comedy and tragedy are one: one extreme transforming into the other. Everything humans perceive as fixed is actually transitory and subject to transformation.‚Äù According to Meinholtz Japanese Noh drama is a guide to achieving the spiritual goals he intended for Native American drama. Meinholtz is inspired by ancient Native American architecture to create contemporary theater spaces. ‚ÄúThe Great Kivas were not the only examples of theatrical structures among Native Americans. The Zuni people build specifically designed rooms onto their houses in which to house the annual Shalako Ceremony.‚Äù  Challenging Stereotypes  Geraldine Keams (Navajo Nation TV and film actress) disrupts Native American stereotypes in her work. Keams has challenges stereotypes through writing and creating plays that include Native American history, such as Flight of The Army Worm, first performed in 1976 at Navajo Community College. Flight of the Army Worm is one of the first contemporary published plays that was done by a Native American Woman. Through Flight of The Army Worm Keams was able to educate others about the Navajo Nation. ‚ÄúThe character of the announcer gives the audience factual information about historical events, while through song, the Guitar Player urges revolution. This combination of modes of presentation aims to sharpen spectator‚Äôs analysis of the historical events they see and hear about. Keams combines Western and Indigenous pedagogies by moving the story from the intellectual account by the announcer to the personal account of Grandmother.‚Äù The Native Theater Movement was built from several theaters, like the American Indian theatre Ensemble, Thunderbird Theater, and Spiderwoman Theater. These theater companies helped consolidate a nationwide Native Theatre movement across the United States and Canada. Native American drama had to fight against indifference and lack of knowledge on the part of some mainstream audiences. Native American playwrights write for a larger audiences who may not be aware that Native Americans are a significant demographic. This creates a double burden on the need to educate as well as to create drama. The ‚ÄúThree Miguel sisters\\" founded the Spiderwoman Theater (1975); their drama has raised the public profile of figures and themes of traditional Native American stories. As more anthologies of contemporary Native American drama are published, the variety and creativity of the contemporary scene has become more apparent. ‚ÄúJust the fact that you‚Äôre on the stage telling these stories is political, just the fact that you‚Äôre there‚Ä¶it is a public act claiming one's native identity is a political act.‚Äù The Native American Theatre Ensemble (1973) presented Native Americans on their own terms to combat stereotypical Indian misrepresentations. Native American playwrights challenge centuries of stereotypes to create realistic characters conceived from their own personal experiences. The American Indian Theater Ensemble resolved to not only to rectify the cultural image of the Native American, but also to produce a body of drama intended primarily for the Indian community. ‚ÄúThe purpose of making the company pan-tribal was to deconstruct stereotypes.‚Äù Hanay Geiogamah was active in the founding years of the American Indian Theatre Ensemble, which produced his one-act play Body Indian. Body Indian is pan-tribal work that demonstrates the problems Native American playwrights face in creating realistic drama based on contemporary Native American life. While Native people have been performing on the stages of the American theatre since the nineteenth century, at the turn of the twenty-first century, only a handful of articles on Native Theatre have been published, and most appeared in magazines rather than academic journals. Scholars in Canada embraced First Nations theatre more quickly, with much of the scholarship during the 1990s appearing in Canadian journals and published by Canadian presses. Now, twenty years later, Native and non-Native scholars seek to redefine the place of Indigenous theatre within the history of \\"American\\" theatre or, more accurately, the theatre of the Americas.  Influence  Indigenous American cultures have been a major aspect of Chicano drama. Chicano/playwrights have been inspired by Native American mythology and history through the use of symbolism and characters to represent Chicano/as, who are considered to be descendants of indigenous Mexico. Before the end of the Mexican War (1848), Mexico consisted of both Texas and California. The use of symbols in Chicano/a plays range from the use of characters being in the play on stage or ‚Äúat other times the Indio is imagined through the use of Indigenous music, flutes, and drums.‚Äù These symbols provide information that is not easily seen and influence the action of the play and were influenced by the Chicano/an's indigenous roots. In the play Day of the Swallows, Estela Portillo Trambley uses an Indigenous male character to represent the protagonist's Native American roots. The main character appears as the ‚Äúnoble savage‚Äù who represents the Indio in the play and Eduardo is paired with a contrasting character, Josefa, who is connected to her heritage and is traditionally feminine. Josefa's connection to her heritage in this play ‚Äúis through images that only she can see and feel.‚Äù This play uses these visions as symbols that are influenced by their indigenous heritage. ‚ÄúEduardo symbolizes the best and the worst of humanity in Josefa‚Äôs world, for he is Nature personified as Man.‚Äù Mummified Deer was written in 1984 by Luis Valdez. His character Cajeme, a deer dancer named after a famous Yaqui who fought against the Mexican government, is portrayed through different elements in the play. ‚ÄúCajeme represents her inner thoughts, her fears, her Yaqui blood and being.‚Äù These plays were written to reconnect Chicanos with their Native American roots. Estela Portillo Trambley and Luis Valdez were the most well-known authors of the Indigenous Chicano drama. They were the early proponents of bringing indigenous roots into Chicano/a plays. Trambley stated in an interview, ‚ÄúI hope‚Ä¶[Chicanos] still relate to seasons and to plants and to colors and to the wind, and to the Indian in them, or the element that is closest to the Earth.‚Äù Trambley is ‚Äúregarded by most Chicano/critics and scholars as the author who inspired and opened the doors for all the Chicana writers who followed her.‚Äù Both of these playwrights used their own style while writing their individual plays. Trambley focused more on writing in the style of realism, which was more general with no indication of specific indigenous people, while Valdez wrote and produced in more specifics communities as well as by using ‚Äúa surreal vision of the Chicano‚Äôs distorted postmodern, internally colonized condition.‚Äù Trambley stated in an interview, ‚ÄúI hope‚Ä¶[Chicanos] still relate to seasons and to plants and to colors and to the wind, and to the Indian in them, or the element that is closest to the Earth.‚Äù References Indigenous theatre Native American dramatists and playwrights ","title":"Native American drama"},{"id":"55993313","text":"In New York City during the early 20th Century, regulations were enacted which required uniformed fire department officers to be permanent attendees of every theatrical production. These Theatre Detail Officers were required to be in the theatre a half-hour before the performance, test the fire alarms, inspect fire wall doors and the fire curtain, and, during performances, ensure that aisles, passageways and fire exits remain clear and accessible. This public- safety measure was part of a group of fire safety measures that were enacted as a result of several theater fire which occurred during that general time period. In December 1905, commenting on theatre fires in his address to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Society President John R. Freeman found significant antecedents in the Brooklyn Theatre fire to the then-recent Iroquois Theatre fire, the 1881 Vienna Ringtheater fire and the 1887 Exeter Theatre Fire: stages crowded with scenery, an onrush of air from opening doors or windows, scant smoke vents over the stage, this giving rise to an outburst of smoke from under the proscenium arch with concomitant deadly effects upon upper gallery occupants. These observations were made twenty-nine years after the disastrous Brooklyn Theatre fire. Engineer Fred J. Manning, Engine Number 5, arriving at 11:22 p.m., testified that the scene doors were about two- thirds open, with \\"one or two men attempting to bring something out of these doors.\\" Abner C. Keeny, part owner and contractor of the building, commenting on the fire the following morning, believed that the sudden inrush of air from the scenic entrance fanned the fire and triggered its spread from the stage to the theatre at large, leading to the rapid advance of smoke onto the family circle.

It is the oldest of the French \\"Haras Nationaux\\" (National Studs).  History  In 1665, under Louis XIV, Colbert created the royal studs administration in order to overcome the lack of horses which then prevailed in the entire kingdom; he also wished to improve French equine breeds. The army was then in dire need of horses, and the kingdom was forced to import them from abroad. As soon as the administration was created, royal stallions were selected and sent out to various areas; they were the only ones allowed to breed. Starting from 1668, the army still lacking in horses, private stallions were also allowed to breed after having been approved of by the State. The area on which to build the first royal stud was chosen in 1714. The quality of the pastures and the easy access to water made Buisson d'Exmes, near Argentan, the perfect spot. The area was bought from Louis de B√©chameil de Nointel,1. He is the son of Louis B√©chameil de Nointel (1630-1703), made famous by the B√©chamel sauce bearing his name. State Counsellor, in exchange for other lands in Picardy. On the 2nd of April 1715, order was given to transfer the haras royal de Saint- L√©ger to Buisson d'Exmes. The estate today covers over 2,471 acres. The first stables were built starting from 1715 and the first stallions arrived in 1717. The architectural style is equivalent to the one of the ‚Äú√âcole de Versailles‚Äù, and Pierre Le Mousseux oversaw the works, following plans which had been drawn by Robert de Cotte, first architect to the Crown and the successor of Jules Hardouin-Mansart., and . The current buildings (both the stables and the castle) were built under the reign of Louis XV, between 1715 and 1730. The writer Jean de La Varende nicknamed it ‚Äúthe Equestrian Versailles‚Äù. Terraces of the castle were put in following the tradition of French formal garden.2. The paternity of Mansart and Le N√¥tre is denied in Le Haras national du Pin, Versailles du cheval, Patrimoine-Monum editions, 2006 On 27 January 1790, the destruction and removal of the ‚ÄúHaras‚Äù were voted, but it narrowly escaped this fate, the National Assembly at the very last moment deciding to establish there a ‚Äúdepot of the best stallions in the Kingdom‚Äù. Nevertheless, the functions of the Haras were re-established only under the First French Empire, in 1810. The ‚Äú√âcole des Haras‚Äù was founded in 1840, and on 29 May 1874, a law decreed one should have studied there to occupy any function as an officer of the ‚ÄúHaras‚Äù. The stud was occupied by the Prussians in 1871, then by the Germans (June 1940-June 1941). It found itself at the heart of the site of bataille de Normandie, close to Falaise, without sustaining any damages.  The Haras du Pin today  The change within the Haras nationaux (national studs) took place at the end of 2013, when breeding as such, the core of their function, was transferred to the private sector. However, the Haras national du Pin maintained its breeding activities thanks to a private cooperative of breeders, the SCIC (Cooperative Company of Collective Interest), which brings together various private breeders. The SCIC set their stallions in the 2nd stable. Some National stud stallions were also rented, in order to pursue their breeding career. The decree of 2 July 2015 created the ‚Äú√âtablissement Public Administratif‚Äù (a public administrative establishment) named the ‚ÄúHaras national du Pin‚Äù: the National Stud was detaching itself from the authority of the IFCE (French Institute for Horses and Riding), in order to be jointly managed by the Orne department, the Basse-Normandie region and the State. The Executive Board is presided by Laurent Beauvais, also Chairman of the Lower Normandy Regional Council. The grounds of the National Stud stretch over the town of Pin-Au-Haras, but also over the neighbouring ones of Exmes, La Coch√®re, Silly-en-Gouffern and Ginai. All are classified as historic monuments. The estate is managed by the \\"EPA Haras national du Pin\\", the \\"IFCE\\" (French Institute for Horses and Riding), the \\"ONF\\" (National Forestry Office) and the \\"INRA\\" (National Institute for Agricultural Research), along with an experimental farm with over 1,000 heads of cattle. In 2019 the IFCE announced it would stop financially supporting the stud (it was paying approximately 75% of the employee salaries) and declared the salary payments would cease as of 2022.  National stud activities  =Tourism and culture= The stud welcomes several tens of thousand visitors every year. It offers guided tours of the Haras du Pin, tours of the Haras castle as well as themed tours (saddlery, blacksmithing, horse breeding). The ‚ÄúDiscovery Trail‚Äù tour of the 1st stable (a horse museum) is available all the year round. The famous ‚ÄúJeudis du Pin‚Äù, or ‚ÄúThursdays at Le Pin‚Äù consist in a presentation of different breeds of horses from the National stud. They take place from June to September. For about ten years now, as well, the Haras du Pin has welcomed each year ‚Äúartists in residence‚Äù. These contribute to the ‚ÄúJeudis du Pin‚Äù, and also offer presentations of their horses on weekends during the spring and summer seasons (from April to September). Temporary exhibits relative to horses are organized each year in the 1st stable. Every year too, the ‚ÄúSeptembre musical de l'Orne‚Äù (‚ÄúMusical September of the Orne‚Äù) is a festival staging two operas mid-September on the stud's riding-rink. =Sporting Competitions= The site, which stretches over more than 2,471 acres, welcomes each year well-known competitions, especially show-jumping or eventing. The Haras du Pin has always welcomed international competitions (the European combined driving Championship in 1979, the World Congress of Percherons in 1989 and 2011, or the Eventing World Cup in 2010, 2011 and 2012). In 2014, dressage and cross-country tests for the 2014 World Equestrian Games Eventing took place in the ‚ÄúParc du Hautbois‚Äù, gathering over 50,000 people. The main competitions to take place in 2016 included the traditional international combined driving competition (July 9 and 10), the ‚ÄúGrand Complet‚Äù (August 16 and 21), the international combined driving competition (August 25 and 28), not forgetting the ‚ÄúPin RacesLes courses du Pin on site du Haras national du Pin.‚Äù, in early May and early October at the Bergerie racecourse (in Ginai). =Training and schooling= The ‚Äú√âcole Sup√©rieure du Cheval et de l'√âquitation‚Äù (‚ÄúHigher School for Horses and Riding‚Äù) is present on the Pin site, having at its disposal high quality training in saddlery, blacksmithing, riding of young horses and combined driving. The broodmare band conducts genetic research on horse breeding. In 2014, four foals, two females and two males, were born from an embryo transfer. This method, the first of its kind in Europe, will enable the maintenance of rare and endangered horse breeds. In 2015, an equine cryobank was implemented. Heritage and grounds *The castle's terraces: overhanging the Hautbois park, this viewpoint is one of the most beautiful of the estate. From the terraces, the public can admire the riding arena, built in 2014 to host the dressage test of the World Equestrian Games Event of the same year. *The tack room of honour: this room presents a fine collection of carriage-driving harnesses, the craftsmanship of which is identical to that of the 19th century. It includes two types of harnesses: English style collars and breast harnesses. There is also a saddle bought by the studs to equip Ouadoud, a Barb horse stallion offered in 2009 by the King of Morocco, Mohamed VI, to honour Franco-Moroccan cooperation. *Equine breeds Draft horses: the Percherons, from the Perche region, are the star horses of the Pin stud. They are the ones pulling the traditional carriages. Black or grey, these horses weigh between 800 and 1200 kg. At the Pin, they are shown both ridden and in harness, and sometimes presented with 'Hungarian Post' stunts or sidesaddle riding. Exported worldwide, they are especially appreciated in the United States and in Japan. Japan in particular is the only country in the world to organize Percheron races, which gather thousands of spectators and also afford betting occasions. 'Hot-blooded' horses: several breeds are noticeable in the stud stables‚Äî Arabian horses, Anglo-Arabians, Selle Fran√ßais, Lipizzans, Hanoverian horses, French Trotters, Thoroughbreds, Andalusian horses... *Horse-drawn cars: The stud owns two warehouses full of collectible horse-drawn vehicles, part of the heritage of the Haras Nationaux. The majority of these vehicles are painted in the colors of the Haras Nationaux: navy-blue and red, with an \\"H\\" on the doors. Among those cars is one ‚ÄúMilord‚Äù (an elegant variation of the English Cab)‚Äî among the four to be found in French public collections; a phaeton; several breaks; a ‚Äúcoup√© de voyage‚Äù... Those cars ‚Äî‚Äîpart of the image of the studs‚Äî still carry nowadays all the history and tradition of this three-centuries old institution. *Furioso's grave: the internationally-known horse, Furioso, a Thoroughbred born in 1939, stood as a stallion at the National Pin Stud from 1946 until his death, in 1967. The ancestor of over 300 horses, including Lutteur B (Olympic champion in 1964 with his rider Pierre Jonqu√®res d'Oriola), Furioso today has fathered many lines of jumping horses of exception. As an honour, Furioso was buried on the estate ; since then, his grave has been constantly covered in flowers.

The Peruvian government has been keen to follow the World Bank's policies for growth. As of September 2018 Peru has $485.44 million in outstanding loans with a mix of 19 different institutions and sectors. The policy reform undertaken by the Peruvian government with the assistance of the World Bank, has stimulated one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America. Overview Peru averaged a growth rate of 6.1% from 2002 - 2013. In 2018, the Work Bank estimated that the Peruvian economy would have one of the highest growth rates among Latin American countries that year. The World Bank also has raised Peru's 2018 GDP growth projection from 3.5% to 3.9% in its latest report. The growth forecast for the following year is 3.8%. The World Bank's ‚Äò‚ÄòCountry Partnership Framework‚Äô for Peru establishes three focus points for the nation's investments. Those are 1) Growing services to citizens that live in rural parts of the country 2) raising productivity 3) risk management from climate change, and natural resource management. To attract outside investment, Peru's government passed an expansive reform agenda, and implemented a new framework for risk allocation by passing new Purchasing power parity laws. These pieces of legislation allow the government to phase out government guarantees and shift financial and construction risk to the private sector. The World Bank currently is providing services to Peru that is partly funded by the Swiss government. Through Switzerland‚Äôs $1.5 million technical assistance program, the World Bank is providing technical assistance on preparing standard contracts, and training on the new procedures required for bank approved projects. Current projects As of November 29th 2018, the world bank has 193 approved projects in Peru. ‚ÄòThe Modernizing water supply and sanitation services‚Äô project has a cost of $200 million. The World Bank approved a $70 million IBRD + IDA loan; the remaining $130 million is contributed though local commitments. The three main objectives for the project are 1) improving governance of the water supply, and sanitation service provider efficiency, 2) expanding the water supply and sanitation services to target regions by expanding and rehabilitating existing infrastructure, 3) training locals though project implementation. Another project called ‚Äòbuilding higher standards for the national statistical system‚Äô was approved on March 20, 2018. It cost $0.4 million and is mostly funded by a grant from ‚ÄúTrust Fund For Statistical Capacity Building‚Äù . Objectives of the project are to create a national strategic plan for statistical development of 2018 - 2022. The project aims to raise the standards for timely and complete national accounts, and the production of statistical information related to Peru's dealings with OECD. The project has been active since June 28, 2018. Positive results The World Bank claims that in result of the policy reforms, job growth was strong enough to lower the percent of the population living on $5.50 a day from 52.2% in 2005 to 26.1% in 2013. This translates to 6.4 million Peruvians being lifted out of poverty. Also the percent of people living on $3.2 a day (extreme poverty) fell from 33.9% to 11.4% in that same time period. A bank approved project called the ‚Äúdecentralized rural transport program\\" maintained 3,277 km of road. This lowed travel time to school by 24.2% on average, this in turn increased enrollment rates of children 12-18 yrs old by 19.2%. Criticisms The policies advocated by the World Bank focus on making the nation more appealing to foreign investment. These policy changes have resulted in cuts in workers‚Äô social benefits, tax cuts for private corporations, and fast-tracking procedures at the state land registry. As a result of these policy changes and others, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) rose from $5.5 billion in 2007 to more than $10 billion in 2013. The World Bank's 'Doing Business' report, highlighted that businesses in Peru being able to reduce wages on labor and pay less in taxes were key to attracting the FDI. In 2015 the Peruvian government rewrote the laws on safety and health at work so that businesses were fined ‚Öì of the previous amount for health and safety violations. Also the new laws diminishes penal sanction for employers in cases of worker injury or death caused by a violation of safety procedures. The new laws also save companies money by lowering the amount of mandatory medical check ups for labor. The business friendly reforms also earned the criticism from Peru's former Environment Minister Jose de Echave, who called the changes a step backwards to preserving the environment. Also Peru's Ministry of Environment has been instructed to not prioritize preventive and corrective measures for businesses that violate environmental policy, instead to just fine companies who violate environmental law. From the structural adjustment period in 2013, the government deregulated and privatized the mining sector. This has brought in $5.4 billion in FDI but also resulted in high rates of deforestation, water pollution and the displacement of local communities. The World Bank supports mining in Peru by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) The Yanacocha mine is the second biggest mine in the world and one of the IFC's most profitable investments. Although the mine has created more than 2,000 jobs, and provides great returns to investors, the city that the mine is located, Cajamarca, and it's residence have had little to no quality of life improvements. Cajamarca remains one of Peru's poorest regions.

Villines worked for both the state of Iowa and the federal government as an advocate. The Des Moines Register called her a \\"nationally known spokeswoman for the disabled\\" in 1992.  Early life  Villines was born in Siam, Iowa. She had a brother named Ronald Jobe. At the age of 3, she contracted Poliomyelitis. When she first went to school, she was sent home with a comment from the teacher who said, \\"I don't have time to teach a handicapped child.\\" Her father was the mayor and her uncle the president of the school board, both of whom helped her stay in school. When she turned 9, she was placed in the Crippled Children's Hospital in Iowa City, and she remained there until she was 16 years old. At the hospital, she was punished for crying. She, and other patients in the hospital were \\"paraded naked in front of medical students 'as the possessors of warped and crippled bodies.'\\" She had 14 surgeries to improve her chances of being able to walk while she was a teenager. Villines had the lead role in her high school's opera performance, however, she was only allowed to sing from backstage and another girl played her role for the audience. As a young person, Villines said she was motivated to succeed because of her grandmother who she helped her see that she could become a leader.  Life and career  Villines served for multiple committees during her career. From 1965 to 1975, she was the Executive Secretary of the Iowa Governor's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped. On the committee, she worked to educate others about what people with disabilities can do and also to work towards greater public accessibility. She was elected president of the Iowa Rehabilitation Association in 1968. In 1971, she named the chair of the women's division for the Easter Seal Campaign in Polk County. She was honored with the National Award of Gallantry from the Easter Seal Society in 1977. She then became the Director of Development at Iowa Lutheran Hospital in Des Moines until 1979. After that, she transferred to the Easter Seals Society of Iowa, Inc. as the Director of the Client Assistance Program from until 1991. During her time at the Easter Seals Society of Iowa, Inc., she became a motivational speaker, presenting her famous \\"In the Name of Love\\" speech to various international organizations. In 1994, President Bill Clinton assigned her to be a member of the Purchase from People Who are Blind or Severely Disabled, where she remained for 5 years before being reassigned for another 5 years in 1999. She was invited by President George H. W. Bush to the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to be a witness. Villines died on September 30, 2017 at the age of 87. She spent 20 years helping a non- profit organization that helps people with disabilities get jobs called SourceAmerica.  Personal life  Villines had 2 daughters named Chris and Tiedeman. Her son, Wes Ferguson, died in 2009. Villines has shared that the first time \\"she felt whole, not disabled\\" was when she held her first child in her arms after giving birth. Villines died at Mercy Hospice in Johnston, Iowa on September 30, 2017.  Legacy  Villines was inducted into the National Hall of Fame for Persons with Disabilities in 1986. In 1994, Iowa state placed her into the Iowa Women's Hall of Fame. in 1995, the National Industries for the Blind created an award in Vilines' name for excellence in the workplace. In 2000, she was recognized as the Woman of the Year by Metro Women's Network of Greater Des Moines. Also in 2000, she was awarded the Medtronic Full Life Award. The National Industries for the Blind's headquarters in Vienna, Virginia were renamed the Evelyn Jobe Villines Training Center in 2004. For serving 20 years at SourceAmerica, the organization named an award after Villines called the Evelyne Villines Award. This award is to recognize leaders in movements.

This cooperative segmental mobility is closely related to the dynamics of the polymer near its glass transition temperature. In the glassy state, the relaxation process of a polymer chain is a cooperative phenomenon and the molecular motion depends to some degree on that of its neighbors.  Background  F. Bueche was the first scientist to come up with the theory of segmental mobility of polymers near their glass transition temperature. He presented two methods to describe the mobility of polymer segments near Tg. Based on his excluded volume calculations, he concluded that any factor which increases the volume disturbed by a rotating segment of a polymer chain or which increases the density of the polymer will in turn increase Tg. Hence, increasing chain stiffness and addition of bulky, but stiff, chain side groups will increase Tg. Later in 1965, Adam and Gibbs formulated the temperature dependence of cooperative relaxation properties in glass forming liquids. It was theorized that the local relaxation of polymer chains occurs in cooperative rearranging regions (CRR) where there is a collective motion of small polymer segments (hence the name segmental mobility). They correlated the size of these cooperative regions to the configurational entropy of the system. Typically the size of the CRR near Tg ranges between 1 and 4 nm. Alexandrov Solunov formulated an equation to determine the average size of the cooperative rearranging regions which corresponds to the average number of structural units that relax together to cross from one configuration to another. He concluded that the glass transition temperature is proportional to the activation energy of these CRRs. Following these work, a lot of researchers started investigating ways to quantify this cooperative segmental mobility which in turn affects the relaxation time of polymers.  Theory  The concept of cooperative segmental mobility comes from the free volume quantification. With the reduction in temperature, the free volume occupied by the polymer segments is reduced. Due to this loss in free volume, cooperative segmental dynamics is significantly slowed near the glass transition temperature and is practically arrested at glass transition temperature. In other words, the molecular rearrangements are frozen. This cooperative segmental mobility has a huge effect on the glass transition temperature of the polymer. As F. Bueche concluded in his work, increasing the chain stiffness and/or adding a bulky stiff side group significantly increases Tg. For example, the glass transition temperature of poly(dimethyl siloxane) is -125 ¬∞C whereas that of poly(isobutylene) is -75 ¬∞C due to stiffer backbone chain. Similarly, Tg for polypropylene is -20 ¬∞C whereas for polystyrene it is 95 ¬∞C due to the presence of bulkier side group. The glass transition temperature in thin films is also affected by this phenomenon. Exposure to the free surface enhances the cooperative segmental mobility which reduces Tg. This can be detrimental in applications like nano electronics, where polymer thin films are used. Experimentally, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy can be used to detect the motion of single molecules, and thus reflect the segmental mobility in their neighboring domains. From simulation perspective, the probability of segment movement (PSM) is a parameter used to directly measure the segmental mobility. PSM is defined as the probability of movement of each segment either by jumping into its neighboring empty sites or partial sliding diffusion. The value of „ÄàPSM„Äâ decreases initially with the decrease of temperature, and then levels off at low temperatures, indicating that the chain segments enter the completely frozen state.

In 2017 Hurricane Irma affected BVI and damaged the school building, so students had to move to the former Clarence Thomas Ltd building in Pasea Estate. The students were divided into two shifts as the temporary building is not big enough to accommodate the students at the same time.

He comes with clouds descending\\" is a hymn with a text by John Cennick (1718‚Äì1755) and Charles Wesley (1707‚Äì1788). Most commonly sung at Advent, the hymn derives its theological content from the Book of Revelation relating imagery of the Day of Judgment. Considered one of the \\"Great Four Anglican Hymns\\" in the 19th century, it is most commonly sung to the tune Helmsley, first published in 1763. Text The content of the text and particularly the title are derived from Revelation chapter 1, verse 7, which tells of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The text has its origins in a hymn \\"Lo! He cometh, countless Trumpets\\" by John Cennick published in his Collection of Sacred Hymns of 1752. This was substantially revised by Charles Wesley for publication in Hymns of intercession for all mankind of 1758. Some hymnals present a combination of the two texts. In the 19th century it was considered one of the \\"Great Four Anglican Hymns\\" on the basis of a survey Anglican Hymnology published by the Rev. James King in 1885. King surveyed 52 hymnals from the member churches of the Anglican Communion around the world and found that 51 of them included this hymn (alongside 'All Praise to Thee, my God, this Night', 'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing' and 'Rock of Ages'). John Cennick Charles Wesley Thomas Olivers Tunes =Helmsley= The tune Helmsley is usually attributed to Thomas Olivers, a Welsh Methodist preacher and hymn- writer. Anecdotal stories about the tune's composition suggest Olivers heard the tune whistled in the street and derived his melody from that; the most likely source is an Irish concert song \\"Guardian angels, now protect me\\". George Arthur Crawford, in A Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1900), discusses the origin: The tune of \\"Guardian Angels\\" is as follows: { time 2/2 key a major relative a' { repeat volta 2 { a4 cis8.[( d32 e]) d8([ b)] gis[( e])  a8.[( b32 cis)] b8[( a)] gis[( fis)] e4  a8[( e)] a[( cis]) b([ e,]) b'([ d])  cis8.[( d32 e]) d8[( cis]) cis4( b)  a4 cis8.[( d32 e]) d8([ b)] gis[( e])  a8.[( b32 cis)] b8[( a)] gis[( fis)] e4  a4 b8( cis) fis,4 d'8.[ e32 fis]  grace fis16 e8[( grace d16 cis8]) grace e16 d8[( grace cis16 b8]) grace b4 a2 } e'4 a8.( fis16) grace fis8 e4. e8  e8.([ d16)] d8.([ cis16)] cis4 b  e8.[( cis16]) e8.[( cis16]) d8.[( b16]) d8.[( b16])  cis[( a e' cis] a'[ e d] cis appoggiatura cis4 b2)  a4 e'8([ cis)] a'[( e]) cis([ a)]  e4 e16( gis b d) cis8 a e  fis4 gis8. a16 e8([ a)] d[( fis)]  fis16([ e d cis] e[ d] cis[ b]) appoggiatura b4 a2 bar \\"\\" } } The hymn-tune melody \\"Helmsley\\" derived from this tune first appeared in the second edition of Wesley's Select Hymns with Tunes annexed of 1765 under the name of \\"Olivers\\": { time 2/2 relative c { repeat volta 2 { c4 e8 g b,8. a16 g4  a( b16 a) c8 g8. f16 e4  g4. g8 c4. d8  e8 g f e grace e4 d2 } d4( e16 d) e8 f4 e  c( d16 e) d8 e[ d] c4  e( f16 e) g8 f[ e] d4  c4. e8 g,4. f'16 a  e4 d c2 bar \\"\\" } } Crawford disproves the suggestion that the tune is based on a hornpipe from the burlesque Golden Pippin of c.1771, noting the chronology makes it likely that the hornpipe was based on the hymn tune, or at least derived from the shared source \\"Guardian angels\\". In some publications, the tune is attributed to Thomas Arne on account of a similarity to an air (possibly \\"Auspicious spirits guard my love\\") from Arne's chamber opera Thomas and Sally of 1760, but the resemblance is slight and the date of that opera make this unlikely. By 1763, the text appeared in print paired with the text \\"Lo! He comes with clouds descending\\" in Martin Madan's Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes sung at Lock Hospital of 1763. Madan's version is a combination mostly comprising Wesley's text, but substituting some of Cennick's verses. This presents the tune in a familiar form with only a few stylistic variations compared to the modern tune: { time 4/4 key g major relative g' { g4 b8( d) grace g,8 fis4 grace e8 d4  e8.[( fis16] g8[) fis16( e)] d8.[trill c16] b4  d4. d8 g4. a8  b[( d]) c[( b]) appoggiatura b4 a2 bar \\"\\" g4^markup { smaller italic Pia } b8( d) fis,4 d4  e8.[( fis16] g8[) fis16( e)] d8.[ c16] b4  d4. d8 g4. a8  b[( d]) c[( b]) appoggiatura b4 a2 bar \\"\\" a8.[ b16] a8[ b] c4trill b  g8.[( a16] g8[)( c]) b8.trill[( a16] g4)  b8.[( c16] b8[)( d]) c8.trill([ b16)] a4  g times 2/3 { g8 a b } d,4 c'  b( atrill) g2 bar \\"\\" } } =Other associated tunes= The hymn is occasionally printed and sung with other tunes in hymnbooks including \\"St Thomas\\", \\"Regent Square\\", \\"Westminster Abbey\\", \\"Kensington New\\" and \\"Cum Nubibus\\". The 1982 Lutheran Worship hymnal sets it to the considerably more sombre tune Picardy. Brooke Foss Westcott, Bishop of Durham, recalled in 1901 that Queen Victoria was displeased after an organist played a different tune at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and requested only Helmsley in future.

Blake was the first black Seventh Day Adventist to become a physician. She is remembered for her revolutionary success in hydrotherapy which at the time was not seen as a sophisticated medical treatment. Lottie Blake, along with her husband Dr. David Emanuel Blake, travelled and worked in Panama, Haiti, and Jamaica as a self-supporting medical missionary. During her life, Dr. Lottie Blake became licensed to practice medicine in Ohio, Tennessee, Alabama, Panama, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Blake found the cure for ‚ÄúSmokey City pneumonia‚Äù which was caused by smog in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After 50 years of service, Lottie Blake was honored by the American Medical Association at eighty-one years old.  Early life  Lottie Isbell Blake was born in Appomattox, Virginia, the daughter of Fannie and Thomas Isbell. When Lottie was three, the Isbell family moved from Virginia to Columbus, Ohio. Thomas Isbell was a carpenter and Fanny Isbell helped to establish the Union Grove Baptist church while raising Lottie and her nine siblings. The Isbell children were raised as Baptists for much of their youth but when Lottie was twenty years old she, her mother, and her sister Mamie converted to become members of the Seventh-day Adventist church.  Education  Following high school, Blake went on to receive her teaching certification at age 20. Though she had studied to become a teacher, Blake went on to train and work as a nurse at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Battle Creek Michigan which was founded by members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, director of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, with whom she lived and worked under became a mentor for Blake during her years as a nurse. Encouraged by Dr. Kellogg, Blake then attended medical school. She graduated from the American Medical Missionary College in 1902 at 26 years old, becoming the first black Seventh Day Adventist to become a physician.  Early career  Initially, Blake‚Äôs missionary work remained within the southern United States. She worked as the director of the Rock City Sanitarium in Nashville, Tennessee and a practicing physician in Birmingham, Alabama. After an epidemic broke out in an orphanage in Huntsville, Alabama, Blake relocated to work there to help. She later went on to work at the Huntsville Oakwood Manual Training School, now Oakwood College, in Huntsville Alabama, where she was the first black faculty member and where she established a nurses training program. After marrying her husband Dr. David Emanuel Blake in 1907, the couple moved to Nashville to work in treatment rooms before moving back to Columbus, Ohio in 1912.  Missionary Work  = Panama = Blake, her husband, and their five children left the United States in 1913 to do missionary work in Panama. The couple served as self-supporting medical missionaries while Lottie Blake cared for their five children. For the four years that the family lived in Panama, Blake engaged in less medical work instead focusing primarily on establishing a school for her children and the children of wealthy people who lived in the area. Yellow Fever and Malaria were the primary illnesses affecting the region of the Panama Canal where the family resided, which became the primary focuses of doctors during that time period. Working with minimal resources, the Blakes were able to successfully acquire the space and equipment to do medical work. It was during this time period in Panama that every member of the Blake family became infected with malaria at some point. = Haiti = After Panama, the family relocated to Port-au-Prince, Haiti in 1917. With little savings and with Haiti being occupied by U.S. Marines, the Blake family stayed in Haiti for only three months, finding the circumstances to be too challenging to live and work in. In this short period of time, the Blakes did manage to establish a church in Port-au-Prince. = Jamaica = The Blake family then went to Jamaica, where David Blake had been born and raised, they lived with relatives for eighteen months.  Post-Missionary Work  Dr. David Blake moved to Charleston, West Virginia with the intention of setting up a medical practice before sending for his family, only he died of pneumonia within a week of arriving in 1917. Lottie Blake sent her children to live with family in Columbus, Ohio while she went to practice in Charleston. In 1920, Blake moved to Columbus where she practiced medicine until 1935. At this point, Blake moved to Pittsburgh, Philadelphia where she focused on the treatment of women and children. It was here that she found the cure for ‚ÄúSmokey City pneumonia‚Äù, which was a type of pneumonia caused by the pollution and smog in Pittsburgh. She continued to work in Pittsburgh until her retirement in 1957 at eighty-one years old.  Death  Dr. Lottie Blake died of natural causes November 16, 1976 at 100 years old.

History The outsourcing industry grew rapidly in the 2000s in China by beginning from an \\"embryonic\\" scale. IDC, an IT industry consultancy, estimated in 2006 that while outsourcing of IT services was growing at 30% annually, the market size was only $586 million at the end of 2005. Most IT services then were offered to domestic companies with offshore clients concentrated in Japan. By 2016, outsourcing was still growing fast at about 20% annually, driven by \\"cloud computing, big data, Internet of things and mobile Internet\\" according to Xinhua. IT services IT related services accounted for about half of the US$87 billion in total service outsourcing provided to export markets in 2015. The largest IT outsourcing companies based in China include ChinaSoft and Pactera. One of the largest China-focused outsourcing companies but based in the US is VXI Global. ChinaSoft is backed by Huawei. Pactera was formed in 2012 by the merger of two industry leaders, VanceInfo and HiSoft. VXI Global was acquired in 2016 by the Carlyle Group, a marquee private equity firm, for around US$1 billion. The deal was seen by Dow Jones as \\"making a big bet that the future of the outsourcing industry, long associated with India, will be in China.\\" Painting Art production is outsourced to China either to mass produce thousands of paintings or execute original works based on instructions from foreign artists. A center for art outsourcing is Dafen Village in Shenzhen, well known for production of imitations of masterworks, but also home to artists who are commission to execute original works. At the high end of the art world, outsourcing to China is practice by Kehinde Wiley, an American portrait painter, who opened a studio in Beijing in 2006. Under Wiley's 4 to 10 helpers do the brushstrokes for his paintings. Cost has been a motivation for outsourcing to China with an art blogger suggesting in 2007 that it allowed those with limited budgets to go from buy posters to oil paintings. Initially, Kehinde Wiley also opened his Beijing studio due to cost sensitivity but by 2012, Wiley told New York magazine that savings costs was no longer the reason for relying on Beijing based helpers.

As can be seen in the figure, Japan has not followed the trend of other Western countries of children born outside of marriage to the same degree. Family policy in the country of Japan refers to government measures that attempt to increase the national birthrate in order to address Japan's declining population. It is speculated that leading causes of Japan's declining birthrate include the institutional and social challenges Japanese women face when expected to care for children while simultaneously working the long hours expected of Japanese workers. Japanese family policy measures therefore seek to make childcare easier for new parents.  History  = Prewar policies = Japanese family policy in the early twentieth century was limited. Japanese industrialization was originally localized in the textile production sector which relied heavily on the participation of women. This prompted female workers to campaign for the institution of childcare services for employees. In the 1890s, coal mines and spinning factories introduced daycare centers (k≈çj≈ç takujisho) for their workers. These early daycare centers were directed towards low-income families and did not offer educational services. They were also primarily run privately by individuals or interest groups who were given government subsidies. The Japanese government frequently introduced reforms during periods of rapid industrialization and war, but slowed its efforts during times of peace. The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) caused the prevalence of daycare centers to increase to 2,200. These 2,200 centers decreased to 18 by 1912. The number of daycare centers also fluctuated in correlation with female participation in the workforce. As construction slowly replaced textiles and mining as the dominant industry, the workforce became more male-dominated and many daycare centers were closed. The Factory Act of 1911 set minimum standards for health and safety by limiting the workday to twelve hours for women and children, as well as introducing a five-week maternity leave policy. Its revision in 1923 decreased the work day to eleven hours for women and children, added breaks for nursing women, and extended maternity leave by four weeks of prenatal leave and six weeks of postnatal leave. The rice riots of 1917 and 1918 prompted an increase in social spending. By 1923, 65% of the Home Ministry's social projects budget was distributed to orphanages, clinics, and daycare centers. = Early postwar policies = Family policies became more progressive in the postwar era; several new policies were introduced by American officials during the U.S. occupation of Japan. The Labor Standards Law (1947) attempted to alleviate gender discrimination by eliminating wage discrimination and ensuring equal treatment (by≈çd≈ç taig≈´) by imposing penalties on offending employers. The law guaranteed women twelve weeks of paid (60% of their regular wage) maternity leave. This program is financed by the Japanese healthcare system. However, the law indirectly causes employers to hire less women as it bars women from working potentially hazardous or overnight jobs, and heavily limited the hours they were allowed to work overtime. The 1947 Child Welfare Law introduced benefits such as provisions for daycare centers and mother-child housing to accommodate those widowed and orphaned during World War II. These benefits were originally provided only to those who demonstrated need, but the program was eventually extended to include all children. This expansion in coverage created problems as demand for services exceeded supply, ultimately causing issues between the Ministry of Education (which oversaw kindergartens) and the Ministry of Health and Welfare (which oversaw childcare more generally). Revisions to the law in 1951 limited access to state-funded childcare to children who were ‚Äúlacking care‚Äù () and established a placement system () with varying fees calculated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Childcare centers managed by the state and non-profit groups conformed to the eight hours of care a day mandated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and could only accept children through the placement program. However, the eight hours of care a day provided frequently failed to meet the needs of parents with full-time jobs. = Late postwar era = Prior to the 1990s, the Japanese family policy was based on the assumption that men were the breadwinners of the family. The policy focused on achieving stable family structures which relied on the full-time employment of men. In response to economic difficulties and the declining fertility rate, changes to the policy become inevitable. The social policy has expanded to address care responsibility, child benefits, the well being of families with children, and childcare. In recent years, major concerns about the fertility rate and childcare services has arisen from the Japanese public and government. There have been successive reforms to the child benefit system based on these concerns. Japan's state- sponsored child benefit programs are not necessarily intended to reduce childhood poverty, rather the child benefit system is mainly focused on increasing the national fertility rate and economic development. = Child Benefit Act = The Child Benefit Act was implemented in 1972. At first, it was an income-tested benefit targeted to lower income groups in Japan. The Child Benefit Act began with 3000 yen as a contribution from local authorities.The table 1 Graph323x323px Government reconsidered its aim and based on an ideology of self-reliance and strong family ties during the oil crisis in the middle of 1970s, they started to target the children who most needed the benefit by increasing the amount of reward money. The Child Benefit Act has two policy goals. The first goal is to provide financial security for children, and the second goal is to support the well-being and development of children. Before 1990, the benefits were only paid to the family of the children until they turned 3 years old. There was a payment of 5,000 yen for the first and second child in the family ($50 a month for the 1st child). Since the eligibility benchmark has been raised, there has also been an increase of the amount of money paid in benefit. Since 2005, only the average earning family can claim this benefit. Families are paid up to $2,448.98 for giving birth to a child since the enactment of the act. In addition, some Japanese employers offer bonuses to their employees for having babies. = Gender-based division of labor = In Japan, caring for young and old people has traditionally been the responsibility of the family. This norm has caused work-family conflict due to its labor division. When raising a child people need access to workers‚Äô income and benefits. Japanese Family Policy has changed its policy in response to the increasing number of working women and the low fertility rate and the work family-conflict. The policy tries to release working mothers from the anxiety and stress of child rearing and encourage childbearing by offering maternity leave, part-time jobs, and being able to work at home. thumb Family policies in Japan are seen to contribute to reaching equality through gender labor and societal roles. Parental and childcare policies are meant to provide higher income but result in increase in mother-service at work and lower home involvement with children. The issue that continues the lack in female employment derives from grandparental care and low fertility rates. For the ‚Äúwomenomics‚Äù in Japan, the participation rate of labor force has reached its highest point in 2014 than last fifteen years. It is 66.0% according to OECD. ‚ÄúWomenomics is the promotion of economic empowerment for women‚Äù. Work contracts encounter restrictions due to length of stay and the child reaching age one. Take-up rate is affected when parental leave policies are not taken advantage of since it lowers economic standing and reduces job continuity. thumb Post-war labor concerns with the distribution of power amongst father and mother. ‚Äú[Men form the core of the labor force and women provide social care that takes place at the family and societal levels]‚Äù. Gender segregation longitudinal studies have covered the interconnection between family, work, and reproduction repercussions. ‚ÄúFathering Japan is an organization that provides seminars and events to private citizens, groups and corporations, functions as the contact point for an active community of fathers, and produces material on participatory fatherhood‚Äù. Maternal assistance varies with tradition, religion, and women's preference. Friendly policies are meant to promote a work-life balance and provide parental satisfaction to accomplish stronger family ties. Women's spousal economic dependency on men has decreased due to the change in housewife expectations. Japan are aim to put more women into the labor force as a strategy to increase the output of Japan's economic growth and improvement in women's income too. Parental Leave/ Child Care Leave Law (1992) In November 2001, this law was partially revised to prohibit business owners from firing, laying off, or downgrading their employees who have applied for this child care leave. 389x389px 360x360px 315x315px Childcare policies contain restrictions for children under six years old (coverage) and institutional credibility (accredited and non-accredited). ‚ÄúAccredited childcare centers must satisfy the criteria for capacity, area, the number of teachers per pupil, etc.‚Äù. Subsidized childcare produce crowd funding with informal grandparental care, especially in a nuclear family oriented with the mother employed. Women's facilitation in the workforce is present but has not accommodated the difficulty of reduction in marriage, childbirth, and low capital. When associated with choices between home-work responsibilities, a mother's leisure and productivity of ‚Äúhuman capital‚Äù is in jeopardy since it falls with the aging of a child. ‚ÄúIn response to concerns about the falling fertility rate, the Ministry of Health and Welfare launched an emergency five- year plan in 1994 to improve daycare services, which was broadened in 1995 to a ten year plan pursued in conjunction with the Labour, Construction, and Education Ministries and named the [‚ÄòAngel Plan‚Äô]‚Äù. The subsidies offer ‚Äòadministrative guidance‚Äô in the span of 1-year leave to withhold job protection according to childbirth situation.

According to Magalh√£es and Yoshimura, photoacceptors are molecules that do not explicitly specialize in light absorption but possess the ability to do so in the presence of light which in turn can enhance their functioning. To generate fluorescence, specialized light absorbing molecules (chromophores) are employed to translate light energy into a high-energy emission of fluorescence through a mechanism known as stokes shift. Fluorescence biomodulation differs from photobiomodulation in that it employs fluorescence as a photo vehicle to induce biomodulation. Fluorescence, as generated by chromophores, is displayed as a broad spectral distribution of wavelengths and/or frequencies which can be controlled to penetrate tissues to various degrees. Tailoring fluorescence biomodulation allows compatibility between the specific emissions of fluorescence and the unique light absorbing characteristics of different cell and tissue types in the body. Shorter wavelengths (<600 nm) within the visible spectrum cannot penetrate deep into tissue and are localized within the epidermis or dermis.

He is currently the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sussex. Background Adam Tickell is descended from the Huxley family. He obtained a first-class degree in Geography in 1987 from the University of Manchester and a PhD from the same institution on the social regulation of banking. Tickell moved jobs frequently, holding positions and professorships at the universities of Bristol, Leeds, Southampton, Birmingham and Royal Holloway, University of London. At the University of Bristol, from 2000, he became research director of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Law. Simultaneously, he was the Vice Chair of the Research Grants Board of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). He later joined Royal Holloway, becoming Dean and Vice-Principal. He joined the University of Birmingham in 2011, becoming Provost and Vice- Principal. He became the vice chancellor of the University of Sussex in 2016. He is the current Chair of Universities UK Open Access Implementation Group.http://www.ids.ac.uk/person/adam-tickell Scholarship Tickell is one a number of geographers active since the 1980s studying the spatial and economic expression of capital, finance, and global markets. Others with whom he has coauthored work include Eric Sheppard, Nigel Thrift and Jamie Peck. In particular, he has explored the nature of post-Fordism and regional decentralisation in the UK. Tickell's most cited work is \\"Neoliberalizing space\\", an article with Jamie Peck in Antipode journal, published in 2002 and cited 4,600 times by 2018. He was editor of Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers in the mid 2000s and is a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences. Controversy In 2018 Tickell attracted hostility from academics and students who felt his academic critiques of neoliberalism were at odds with the stance he took as a Vice Chancellor during the 2018 USS pension dispute over threats to academic pensions. Posters appeared saying \\"Critiques neoliberalism in academic articles, but privatises the university for cash\\". He told The Badger that the UCU strikes would achieve nothing, even though he was once a UCU member and rep; this proved incorrect. The University of Sussex financial statements 2016-17 state that Mr Tickell was paid ¬£267,000 for the period of September 2016 to July 2017, plus ¬£17,000 relocation costs and ¬£9,000 in pension contributions.

Her family was of Italian origin and active within banking in Lyon.She was very close to her fathers brothers and she grew up in the Belregard a castle which was built over a demolished house which her father bought. =Life in Lyon= In 1516, she married the Florentine banker Antoine (Antonio or Guidobaldo) Gondi (1486‚Äì1560), who had emigrated to France in 1506. Antoine de Gondi was a member of the Italian Gondi family, who was to make a great career in the offices of the royal households under the patronage of Catherine de Medici, and the marriage between Marie Catherine and Antoine de Gondi is estimated to have been the beginning of the Gondi party's rise at court. Marie Catherine Gondi was the mother of ten children, many of whom made careers within the royal court, most notably Albert de Gondi (who married Claude Catherine de Clermont). Marie Catherine Gondi became a leading figure in Lyon. In 1521, her spouse acquired the noble estate or seigneurie du Perron, and during the 1520s- and 1530s, Marie Catherine Gondi became the central figure in a circle of humanists and intellectuals such as √âtienne Dolet, Bonaventure Des P√©riers, Papire Masson and Maurice Sc√®ve. =Court career= Marie Catherine Gondi made the acquaintance of Catherine de Medicis in 1533, when Catherine visited the city of Lyon shortly after her wedding to the future Henry II of France. In 1544, she was called to the household of Catherine, where she became her trusted companion and personal friend. In 1550,Nicolas Le Roux, La faveur du roi: mignons et courtisans au temps des derniers Valois she was appointed royal governess (Gouvernante des Enfants de France) to the royal children. Queen Catherine recommended her to the household of the royal children to have an ally there, as the royal nursery was controlled by Jean d'Humi√®res and his wife Fran√ßoise d'Humi√®res, the governor and the governess to the royal children respectively, who were loyal to Diane de Poitiers, but the king only appointed Marie-Catherine Gondi as sub-governess and under ranked d'Humi√®res.Susan Broomhall, Women's Medical Work in Early Modern France In 1559, Catherine appointed her Dame (lady-in-waiting) to her daughter-in-law, Mary Stuart. Gondi was given the responsibility for Catherine's personal finances general administrator for her projects and building works and in effect became her treasurer.Frieda, Leonie, \\"Catherine de Medici\\", Orion Books, London, 2005, p. 88 She often acted as Catherine's business agent, buying and selling property on her behalf: notably when she lend Catherine money to finance the construction of the Tuileries Palace, and given power to represent Catherine during its construction. Her favored position as a trusted confidante of Catherine, made her the subject of sensational rumors. One such rumor, recounted by Tallemant des Reaux, was that Marie Catherine Gondi, by means of a recipe, cured the supposed infertility of Catherine and enabled her to start conceive in 1543, after ten years of marriage without children. This was supposedly the cause of the patronage of Catherine de Medici of the Gondi family, and the great success of that family in acquiring offices in the royal household.It is believed she died on August 4, 1570.

Because of Its simplicity & incredibly fast application time. Karate originated in the island of Okinawa with the influence of Chinese Gong Fu which, in turn had been influenced by ancient Indian martial arts. Hence, Karate is indirectly related to India. Karate is a striking based martial art, which includes punches, blocks, kicks and open hand strikes. It does not require full contact sparring like boxing and MMA. This makes it safer for children. These factors contributes the growth of Karate world wide. History Karate grew in popularity in India in 1970s and 1980s, with many dojos first established in major cities. The Karate Association of India (KAI) is the not nationally recognized body for governing karate in India as of 2020.

The more general reaction, hydroalkenylation is the formal insertion of an alkene into the C-H bond of any terminal alkene. The reaction is catalyzed by metal complexes. A representative reaction is the conversion of styrene and ethylene to 3-phenybutene: :PhCH=CH2 + CH2=CH2 ‚Üí CH3-CH(Ph)-CH=CH2. Ethylene dimerization The dimerization of ethylene gives 1-butene is another example of a hydrovinylation. In the Dimersol and Alphabutol Processes, alkenes are dimerized for the production of gasoline and for comonomers such as 1-butene. These processes operate at several refineries across the world at the scales of about 400,000 tons/year (2006 report). 1-Butene is amenable to isomerization to 2-butenes, which is used in Olefin conversion technology to give propylene. Hydroarylation Hydroarylation is again a special case of hydrovinylation. Hydroarylation has been demonstrated for alkyne and alkene substrates. An early example was provided by the Murai reaction, which involves the insertion of alkenes into a C-H bond of acetophenone. The keto group directs the regiochemistry, stabilizing an aryl intermediate. A Murai reaction (X = directing group, typically X = O). When catalyzed by palladium carboxylates, a key step is electrophilic aromatic substitution to give a Pd(II) aryl intermediate. In organic synthesis As first reported by Alderson, Jenner, and Lindsey hydrovinylation uses rhodium- and ruthenium-based catalysts. Catalysts based on iron, cobalt, nickel, and palladium have also been demonstrated. The addition can be done highly regio- and stereoselectively, the choices of metal centers, ligands, substrates and counterions often play very important role. N-heterocyclic carbene complexes of Ni allow the selective preparations of functionalized geminal olefins or 1,1-disubstituted alkenes.

Early Life: Education and personal life  Paul was born in Sawyerpuram on August 19, 1941 to parents Paul Ratna Samy and Gladys. He had four siblings‚Äîtwo older sisters named Priscilla and Nirmala, a younger sister named Ramani, and a younger brother named Dhanapaul. = Education = In 1957, he passed SSLC and attended Madras Veterinary College. After becoming a doctor, he joined Virudhunagar veterinary hospital and received a degree in 1963. He also attended Emmanuel Methodist Church at Veppery, Chennai. = Personal Life = Dr. RAC Paul was introduced to his future wife Dr. Iris Paul by her college friend Chandra. Her father Mr. Walter went to Malkangiri in order to meet Paul and approved of him due to his hospitality and politeness. He then gave Paul permission to marry his daughter. RAC and Iris were wed on January 24, 1972 at Emanuel Methodist Church. Their first child, son ‚ÄúRemo‚Äù (meaning ‚Äúman‚Äù in the Bondo language), was born in 1974. Their second son, Manoranjan, was born in 1977. The couple adopted two Bondo children during their work as missionaries among the Bondo tribes. They named these children David Livingstone and Mary Smrutha. = Influence of Religion and Health = As a young child, Paul had not initially accepted religion. When he fell ill, however, he turned to religion and prayed to live. This influenced him to become a doctor and work as a medical and religious missionary. He wanted to spend his life in \\"the Lord's service\\". After the birth of his second son in 1977, Paul fell ill with kidney problems. He needed a kidney transplant, which he received in the USA. After the transplant, he and Iris returned to their work in India. Paul suffered a paralytic attack on January 24, 1980. He suffered from ill health, including typhoid and jaundice, until his death in 1986. In the hospital, when he felt well enough, he told nearby patients the gospel. He ultimately died during by-pass surgery.  Mission  = Call = Paul learned of a need for a missionary in Orissa (present-day Odisha) through IMS News Bulletin in Muthumalai magazine. The notice in the magazine asked for missionaries to go work in Orissa. He applied immediately. = Journey = Upon being selected, he left for service on January 15, 1967 and arrived at Malkangiri on January 23, 1967. He started medical work with the Koya, Bondo, Santhali and Poraja tribal groups. He met Munshi, a Bengali christian, in the village MV3 and taught bible lessons there. After their wedding, on February 9, 1972, Dr. Iris and Dr. RAC Paul journeyed together to Malkangiri to begin medical work on the Bondo tribes. They left IMS and joined Indian Evangelical Mission, which sent two other missionaries to work with the Pauls: Bros Sasi Kumar and Jeyapaul Sithar. = Service = The Pauls went to Bondo Hills, lived there, and did the ministry during the week and medical work on Sundays. They returned to Malkangiri once per week. The local tribal people were isolated and known as murderous. Paul was determined to reach them with religion. He became close with the locals, and they endearingly called him \\"Mr. Tall\\". Together, RAC and Iris treated and helped with many health problems, including the following: Malaria, Tuberculosis, skin diseases, dysentery, and the delivery of babies. After Paul‚Äôs kidney transplant, IEM shut down the work in Malkangiri. Dr. Iris and RAC Paul then resigned from IEM and returned to the base at Malkangiri. They continued medical and gospel work in Malkangiri but could no longer work with the Bondo tribes. Without the support of IEM, the Pauls faced financial difficulties, in addition to Dr. RAC Paul‚Äôs own medical problems. = Return = Paul suffered a paralytic attack on January 24, 1980, and from then on, he had to stay at home and assist Iris in her medical work. He told patients the gospel but was no longer able to continue his work in the ministry. He died in 1986.  Legacy  = Lasting impact on the Bondos = Dr. RAC Paul translated the New Testament into the Bondo language. The Bondos have been able to continue practicing Christianity. = Inspiration to Others = At an IEM promotional meeting, slides of Dr. RAC Paul and Dr. Iris Paul were shown to a group of aspiring missionaries. At the time, Dr. RAC Paul was receiving medical treatment at CMC Vellore. One attendee of this meeting recalled being inspired by the following declaration, which was given by the man giving the presentation: \\"If a dying man is willing to keep on serving the Lord in a dry land, where there was no fruit, or benefit, what about you young people who have good health and strength?\\" = Continuation of his Work After Death = His wife, Dr. Iris Paul, continued working with the Bondos upon Paul‚Äôs dying wish that she and their children would continue working as missionaries. Dr. Iris Paul received the Yoke Fellow Award from the Direct Mission Aid Society in 1988 and eight years later, she received the Robert Pierce International Award for Christian development work by World Vision International. = Reaching Hand Society = Iris founded the Reaching Hand Society. Now, Remo Paul and his wife Dr. Susan Sunalini Paul run the RHS as Executive Secretary and Medical Superintendent, respectively.

However, private and occupational pensions are secondary to the public pension issued through the state. According to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), Austria's pension system is categorized as targeted. This means that their system is set up to prefentially benefit poorer pensioners than those that are better off.  Public pension  Austria introduced their uniform pension system through The Act on the Harmonisation of Austrian Pension Systems on January 1, 2005. This act provides a pension for anyone employed and under the age of 50. This uniform pension system is the reason why private and occupational pensions are second to the state pension. Austria's public (or state) pension system is a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system. This system is funded by those currently working and employers too. Employees contribute 10.25% of their earnings to the pension system and employers contribute 12.55%. A recent reform merged the two Austrian Pension Agencies that represented blue-collar and white-collar workers into one: the Austrian Pension and Retirement Agency. To receive the Austrian state pension a citizen must have paid contributions for at least 180 months (15 years). The longer a citizen pays, the higher their income replacement ratio is. If a worker pays into their pension for 45 years then they can receive up to 80% of their average lifetime income while retired. This is referred to as the 45 - 65 - 80 rule. When the citizen reaches retirement age (65 for men and 60 for women) they can then apply to receive their state pension. The age of retirement for women will gradually increase until it reaches 65 by 2033. Early retirement at the age of 62 was also an option until 2017. Pension benefits are based on personal income taxation and the benefits are adjusted yearly by inflation.  Occupational pension  There are supplemental occupational pension plans that can be provided by employers to their staff. The occupational pension plan that employers can provide is Pensionskassen. This pension fund is set up through a legal contract that ensures the pension fund is completely separate from the company. Large companies set up their own pension funds while smaller companies can join multi-employer pension funds. Other supplemental funds are: * occupational collective insurance (Betriebliche Kollektivversicherung) * internal book reserves * support funds (Unterst√ºtzungskasse) * direct insurance These other funds are ways for citizens to invest in their retirement and supplemental funds to their state pension.  Problems with the expansion of the pension system  Austria's public pension system is expensive and it is only becoming a larger entity. In 1970, 9.9% of the countries gross domestic product (GDP) was attributed to public pension expenditures and that amount increased to about 14.5% in the year 2000. This is because the contributions made by employees and employers are simply not enough to cover the retirement bill. This increase in cost is attributed to many components some of which are the option of early retirement and disability pensions. Even though the retirement age is 65, the number of elderly people between ages 60 and 65 in the workforce make up only 10%. Because of these increased costs, Austria imposed reforms that mainly discouraged early retirement by withholding full pension amounts until the receiver reached age 65. The required contribution period was also extended. Other problems that Austria faces with their pension system is the fact that people are living longer, while at the same time fertility rates are going down. Since the pension system is based on the contributions by those currently working, if the labor force goes down due to low fertility rates, then the amount of money available for pensioners is also reduced. The fact that those receiving pensions are also living longer is also responsible for the increased cost. As a result, the ratio of elderly people to those working and contributing to the pension fund will more than double within the next 30 years.  Reforms  The 2003 Austrian Pension Reform had five main elements aimed at lowering the burden of the pension fund on the state. # Discouraging and ending early retirement completely by 2017. # Encouraging late retirement with incentives for those working past age 65. Those who worked past the retirement age were rewarded with 4.2 percent in bonuses per year. # Increasing the contribution period average from 15 to 40 years. Before this reform, the amount received by pensioners would be the average of the income over the best 15 years. With this reform, the period was increased to 40 because the average of 40 years would be lower than 15 years, therefore decreasing the benefits. # Increasing the contribution period necessary to receive a full pension from 40 to 45 years. # The reform established a hardship fund, created to help those with pension payments lower than ‚Ç¨1,000/month and have contributed for at least 30 years.

He was the subject of many legends in the folklore of Catherine de Medici, and reputed as a master of the occult, black magic and witchcraft during his lifetime. Life Cosimo Ruggeri's presence at the French royal court is first attested in 1571. He was a part of the entourage of the Tuscan ambassador to France, Petrucci; known for his scholarly knowledge, he was a tutor of the Italian language to Elisabeth of Austria, Queen of France. After claims of being able to predict the future through his knowledge in astrology, he was no longer well seen by Elisabeth, but reported to have become be a favorite of the queen mother, who asked him of advice in matters of state because of his alleged ability to predict the future, and is said to have came to exert influence over her with his alleged occult knowledge in the dark arts. In 1574, he became implicated in the attempted homicide of Joseph Boniface de La M√¥le, when he was reputedly hired to bring about the death of Charles IX by the use of sorcery. He was arrested and sentenced to the galleys for complicity. However, the verdict was never made use of, and in 1585, he was also pardoned formally. The reason for this is regarded to have been his relation to the queen mother. In 1598, he was prosecuted for having manufactured a doll of Henry IV of France with the intent of murder through sorcery, but freed. During the queenship of Marie de' Medici, he was a personal friend of the queen's favorites Concino Concini and Leonora Dori. When he died in Paris in 1615, riots broke out because of rumors about magicians caused by his refusal to receive sacrament on his deathbed, which was also the subject of a libel against him, denouncing him as a sorcerer. Legends Many famous legends are told about Cosimo Ruggeri, his relation to Catherine de Medici and his alleged knowledge in the occult. He allegedly predicted that Catherine de Medici would die near \\"Saint-Germain\\", which was the name of her confessor at her deathbed, Julien de Saint-Germain. He allegedly correctly predicted to Catherine de Medici that three of her sons would be kings, and how long they would reign, by the help of an enchanted mirror in the Chaumont-sur-Loire.

As of 2018 he is Professor Emeritus at the Department of Earth Science and the Marine Sciences Institute at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). His work focuses on the tectonics and geophysics of the global mid-oceanic ridge including its spreading centers and transform faults, two of the three types of plate boundaries central to the theory of plate tectonics. His work has taken him to the north and south Atlantic oceans, the north and south Pacific oceans, the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and the Sea of Cortez, as well as to the deep seafloor on over 50 dives in the research submersible ALVIN. Macdonald has participated in over 40 deep sea expeditions, and was Chief- or Co-Chief Scientist on 31 expeditions.  Early life and education  Macdonald grew up in El Cerrito and Richmond, California, and graduated from Harry Ells High School in 1966. He attended UC Berkeley graduating with a B.S. in Engineering in 1970. Funded by a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970, graduating from the MIT/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Oceanography specializing in marine geophysics in 1975. He was awarded a Cecil H. and Ida Green Research Fellowship to work at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics with Dr. James Brune in 1975. He joined the research staff at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1976 as Research Geophysicist working with Dr. Fred Spiess. In 1979, he joined the faculty of the Department of Geological Sciences at UCSB and the Marine Sciences Institute as an Associate Professor and Research Geophysicist.  Career and impact  His PhD work focused on the tectonic and magnetic properties of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on Project FAMOUS expeditions led by Dr. Bruce Luyendyk. (his other primary advisor was Dr. Tanya Atwater). He was Co-Chief Scientist of the RISE project - a research expedition which discovered superheated \\"black smoker\\" hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise in 1979, and was the first to calculate their contribution to global geothermal heat flux. He was also chief scientist and lead diver on the expedition which documented in situ, the recording of magnetic reversals in the volcanic rocks of the deep seafloor, an important aspect of proving seafloor spreading and plate tectonics. Macdonald led expeditions which mapped the Vema and Tamayo Transform faults, showing that the plate boundary intersection of an oceanic ridge and transform fault is sharp, only a few km in area, and documenting that these two types of plate boundaries are narrow. Their work demonstrated that the inside corner region is an area of diffuse deformation caused by extreme tectonic extension. He was Chief Scientist on the expedition which discovered ‚ÄúOverlapping Spreading Centers‚Äù (OSCs). In this geometry two active spreading centers overlap, apparently pushing against each other, which would violate one of the rules of plate tectonics: plates are rigid. This paradox is solved by the fact that the OSCs are non-steady-state, and propagate along the ridge; as one segment lengthens, the neighboring segment shortens, and the overlapped region migrates. Previous to this discovery, it was thought that mid-ocean ridges were offset only by transform faults, usually at right angles. The expedition found that the ridge is segmented on a length scale of hundreds of kilometers by transform faults, but also at much shorter scales, km to tens of kilometers, by Overlapping Spreading Centers and other types of nontransform discontinuities. The long segments persist for millions of years, while the finer scale segments are shorter-lived, hundreds of thousands of years or less. The shorter segments are important because they define the scale at which individual volcanoes function on the ridge, which, in turn, control the creation of new oceanic crust and hydrothermal activity  Awards and Honors  In recognition of his work he was the first marine geophysicist to be awarded the Cody gold medal and prize for his outstanding work and leadership in the Ocean Sciences as well as election as Fellow to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Fellow of the American Geophysical Union (1995), Fellow of the Geological Society of America (1995) and co-recipient of the Newcomb Cleveland Prize for the most important article published in Science magazine in 1980 for the discovery and analysis of black smoker vents.

It may also describe the vocabulary of an earlier stage of a language's development without covering present-day usage at all. A historical dictionary is primarily of interest to scholars of language, but may also be used as a general dictionary.  Features  New English Dictionary), showing use of cited quotations and chronological ordering of senses.alt= Typical features of a historical dictionary are: * Senses of words listed in the order they were first used, allowing the development of meaning over time to be seen * Comprehensive etymological information, often directly referencing academic research on word history * Use of illustrative quotations, complete with citations of their sources, providing references and proof of a word's actual existence and use in a given time period * Dates of first use (and, for obsolete usages, last use) with each word and each sense of each word (if there are quotations in the dictionary, the first quotation is usually the very first example which is known) However, not all dictionaries which are called 'historical' have all of these features. For example, the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary includes only minimal quotations, with most entries having only an approximate date of first use, and the Webster's New International Dictionary (which, though it does not market itself as historical, is founded on historical principles) features only dates of first use and does not order its senses chronologically.  History  For some languages, like Sanskrit and Greek, the historical dictionary (in the sense of a word-list explaining the meanings of words that were obsolete at the time of their compilation) was the first form of dictionary developed; though not being scholarly historical dictionaries in the modern sense, they did give a sense of semantic change over time. Early modern European dictionaries also often included a significant historical element, without being fully historical in form; for instance, Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language (1755) included quotations from admired writers as well as some words that were obsolete or obsolescent by the mid 18th century. Modern historical principles emerged fully with the publication of John Jamieson's Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language (1808). Like modern historical dictionaries, Jamieson attempted to find the earliest use of each word, and printed quotations in chronological order demonstrating the changes which had occurred to that word throughout history. In 1812 the German classicist Franz Passow laid out his plan for a comprehensive dictionary of the Greek language which would 'set out [‚Ä¶] the life story of each single word in a conveniently ordered overviews', which was completed as the Handw√∂rterbuch der griechischen Sprache in 1824. This idea was transmitted to the English-speaking world through the work of Liddell and Scott on their Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon (1843), based on a translation of Passow's work into English. However, it was not until the beginning of the Deutsches W√∂rterbuch project of the Brothers Grimm in 1838 that a historical dictionary of a modern language was attempted. Throughout the later nineteenth century numerous historical dictionary projects were started for the various languages of Europe. The main historical dictionary of English, the Oxford English Dictionary, was initiated in 1857 and was completed in 1928. Recently the availability of historical text corpora and other large text databases such as digital newspaper archives have begun to influence historical dictionaries. The Tr√©sor de la langue fran√ßaise was the first historical dictionary to be based mainly on a computerized corpus. Most recent historical dictionaries and historical dictionary revision projects have been based on a mixture of quotations taken down be hand and texts from corpora.  Compilation  Because of their size and scope, the compilation of historical dictionaries takes significantly longer than the compilation of general dictionaries. This is often exacerbated by the scholarly nature and limited audience for the works, meaning that the budget is often limited; historical dictionary projects often survive on a grant-to-grant basis, seeking new funding for each new section of the work. Some historical dictionaries, such as Jonathan Lighter's Historical Dictionary of American Slang, have proven to be so expensive for their publishers that they have ended production before the dictionary was completed. Traditionally historical dictionaries were produced by employing a large number of readers to read and excerpt from historical texts into individual pieces of paper, which were then collated into alphabetical order and referred to during the compilation of the relevant entry. The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, established a reading programme at its foundation which continues to this day. The advent of computerized full-text search databases and techniques means that lexicographers can now make use of corpora of documents to gain a more balanced view of the history of a particular word or phrase, as well as finding new quotation material to fill gaps in the history of some words; some lexicographers have noted, however, that electronic search is not a complete replacement for manual quotation-gathering, among other things because though it can help finding examples of a word already known to exist, full-text search is less good at identifying which words need to be researched in the first place.

Despite efforts made at time of the founding of the Middle English Dictionary project to produce a dictionary of Early Modern English, this never came to fruition. Several historical dictionaries exist which cover the dialects and regionalisms particular to certain geographical areas, like the English Dialect Dictionary, the Scottish National Dictionary and the Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue, the Dictionary of American Regional English, the Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles, and the Australian National Dictionary. Uniquely, from the 1960s to the 2000s, a historical thesaurus was produced for English, which inverts the traditional historical dictionary by showing the development of concepts into words, rather than the development of words to describe different concepts. The Historical Thesaurus of English was published in 2009 and is largely based on data from the Oxford English Dictionary; a similar project is now underway for the Scots language. = French = * Dictionnaire de la langue fran√ßaise * Tr√©sor de la langue fran√ßaise * '''' = German = The largest historical dictionary of German is the Deutsches W√∂rterbuch originally compiled by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm and completed after their death in 1961.

For decades pensions in Greece were known to be among the most generous in the European Union, allowing many pensioners to retire earlier than pensioners in other European countries. This placed a heavy burden on Greece's public finances which (coupled with an aging workforce) made the Greek state increasingly vulnerable to external economic shocks, culminating in a recession due to the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent European debt crisis. This series of crises has forced the Greek government to implement economic reforms aimed at restructuring the pension system and eliminating inefficiencies within it. Measures in the Greek austerity packages imposed upon Greek citizens by the European Central Bank have achieved some success at reforming the pension system despite having stark ramifications for standards of living in Greece, which have seen a sharp decline since the beginning of the crisis. In proportion to their respective GDPs, the Greek government has historically spent more on their pension system than other European countries. In 2014, Greece spent around fourteen billion euros from the state budget on the pension system. This amount accounts for 7 (or so) percent of its annual GDP. Despite the increased levels of government spending on the pension policy, Greek workers were still expected to heavily contribute to their pensions. The combination of government involvement and worker contributions created a Bismarckian welfare state in which the focus was on income maintenance based on employee and employer contribution (instead of poverty prevention). The mixture of economic crisis and inefficient social redistribution concentrated on pensions has decimated Greece's ability to pursue other forms of social insurance. Greece spends 2% of its GDP on benefits such as housing, family, and poverty relief, signifying that the Greek government spends around 3.5 times more on the public pension system than on other forms of welfare and social insurance. Furthermore, a significant portion of the Greek population relies on their pensions as the main form of income for their family. As of 2017, nearly one in two families in Greece stated that the money from pensions is the dominant source of salary. While Greece has historically given generous pensions at early retirement ages compared to the European average, it has also historically suffered from unequal distribution of pensions and social benefits with already well-paid workers having a major advantage. Before the economic crisis, in 2008, social wealth redistribution mostly benefited pensioners and social insurance programs while low-income families received less than 10% of available cash benefits. Given that the 2010 pension reforms placed additional financial burden on impoverished and aging demographics, the full scope of the reforms could not be implemented due to the fear of further exclusion and impoverishment. Greece's pension reform in 2016 was partially intended to address these issues, and some analysts predict that it has opened the door to further reforms in the near future.  The primary pension scheme  Public pensions in Greece are provided by public funds and pensioner's contributions during working years. Benefits are determined by a combination of factors: number of years worked (via contributions), and years of residency in Greece. The primary pension scheme consists of two components: a contributory component and a more supplemental residency-based component. The first component of the scheme is funded entirely by pensioner's contributions. It incentivizes longer periods of contribution by providing higher accrual rates (the rate at which the pension accumulates annually) to pensioners who have worked for longer stretches of time. Pensioners with fifteen years or less worth of contributions only receive their pensions with an accrual rate of 0.77%, thus collecting less when reaching retirement age. This rate increases progressively based on the number of years worked to a maximum of 2% for those who have contributed a minimum of 40 years. These pensioners are rewarded by being able to retire at the minimum retirement age of 62 while collecting their pensions at the maximum aforementioned rate of 2%, instead of collecting full pension benefits at the normal retirement age of 67. The other component is a state funded national pension based on years of residency. Pension amounts are determined by number of years of residency from age fifteen to the minimum age permitted to receive the pension (age 62). A maximum monthly payment amount of ‚Ç¨384 is allocated to pensioners with forty years of residency and with a contribution history of twenty years. A minimum monthly payment of ‚Ç¨345.50 is allocated to pensioners with a history of fifteen years of contributions. A 2% reduction (2% per year under 20 years spent contributing) to the maximum payment is applied to pensions collected by pensioners with histories between fifteen and twenty years spent contributing. =Historical rates= Prior to 2010, most employees had a contribution rate of 6.67%, while employers contributed 13.33% (double the employee rate), with a higher rate for hazardous occupations. As of 2016 when the Greek government reformed the pension scheme, the self-employed sector and other white-collar sectors have had their respective contribution rates equalized and unified, standing at 20% of their annual income (regardless of assumed earnings).  European influences  European influences and domestic politics have both played a significant role in the welfare state reforms that have taken place in Greece over the past twenty five years. Although private interests and bureaucratic mechanisms have opposed widespread reform in the welfare system, the influence of the EU has been pervasive encompassing policies including social assistance and public pensions. Greece suffered from high public debt and deficit which it was unable to overcome despite strong economic growth in the years preceding the debt crisis. Funding the Greek government's budget and its deficits created a strong need for borrowing in international markets and Greece entered a Memorandum of Understanding with its prospective lenders, leading to the implementation of reforms sought by the European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund. The adoption of austerity measures and pro-market reforms created significant challenges to Greece's economy which economists have described as a 'political economy of generalized insecurity'. The impact these reforms have had on an already fragile familistic welfare capitalist economy has only deepened the European sovereign debt crisis. With the Economy overwhelmed by a defect of over 15%, Greece turned to its European allies for help, and was able to secure 110 billion euros. Although the government faced criticism for its decision to adopt the austerity measures, without the recommended economic reforms, particularly spending cuts and reforms to social welfare programs including public pensions, it was feared that Greece lacked the ability to repay these loans and would soon be in a similar or worse economic position, unable to fund its government. The effect of these reforms on pensions including raising the contribution rate of Greek pensioners and changing the eligibility age to collect pensions. The economic benefits of these changes included slowing the rise of the pension system's elderly dependency rate and reducing the number of years that retirees collect pensions, a strategy designed to successfully address the shrinking labor force problem. Greek economists and their European and international partners predicted a short recessionary period as a result of these adjustments, followed by a period of sustained economic growth. The effectiveness of these adjustments to the public pension system is still contested, although it is argued that their failure to achieve projected growth is a result of systematic weaknesses in the Greek economy as opposed to measures‚Äô efficacy.  Effects on the Greek population  The public pension system (and the austerity packages that have resulted from the pension scheme) have taken a heavy toll on the population of Greece overall. The continuous cuts of the pension system and the decreasing GDP has devastated the population of pensioners, with an estimated 1.5 million pensioners falling below the poverty threshold and a total income loss of 70%. Moreover, the calls for balancing the budgets and deficits through austerity cuts has led to decreases in the budget for other crucial social programs. With the Greek government focusing on funding the pension scheme, programs such as healthcare, unemployment benefits, and education have suffered. In terms of healthcare, Greece's budget for public hospitals was slashed by 25% between the years of 2009 and 2011, leaving up to 1 million citizens without access to sufficient healthcare. The Greek government has also been unable to provide unemployment benefits and opportunities for the unemployed to re-integrate into the workforce, as studies show nine out of ten unemployed Greek workers fail to receive unemployment benefits, with 74% of the unemployed remaining without work for a minimum of 12 months. Education (both primary and secondary) has felt the weight of the focus on pensions and austerity as well, creating a lack of skilled workers for the Greek economy. After accounting for inflation, the education system in Greece has faced similar budget cuts as the healthcare system, ranging from 20 to 25% (as of 2011). All of these budget cuts have led to Greece's score of Subjective Well-Being falling a total of one point over the past decade on OECD's scale (ranked 0 to 10); a sharper decrease than any other OECD country.

Born in Hawaii and married to the first Native Hawaiian governor of the state, she was raised in Kalihi. Educated at Andrews University, her first vocation was teaching. She used her position as first lady to raise the standard of children's literacy in Hawaii. She helped found a children's museum and was a role model for volunteer service in the community, instituting the First Lady's Outstanding Volunteers Program.  Background  She was one of five children born in Hawaii to Toshio and Matsue Kobashigawa. Both parents were of Okinawan ancestry, and her mother was a first-generation Hawaii immigrant from Okinawa Island. Her father died when she was 5 years old, and her mother raised the children in Kalihi as a single parent. She and John Waihe'e III were both 1964 graduates of the private Seventh-day Adventist Hawaiian Mission Academy. Both graduated from Andrews University in Michigan, where Lynne began her teaching career. The couple married in Michigan, and their children were born there. John involved himself in small-town community activism while in Michigan, with people already predicting his rise in politics.;  As first lady  The Waihee family returned to Hawaii in 1971. A proponent of children's literacy, Lynne became a teacher at Hawaiian Mission Academy. Her husband's victory in the 1986 gubernatorial election made him the first Native Hawaiian elected to the governorship from any state of the United States. At the time of his inauguration, the family continued to live in a modest Kalihi condo while Washington Place was undergoing work. For her first luncheon at the White House with Nancy Reagan, she had students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa design her a dress. Eventually she commissioned the students to design an entire wardrobe for her, that was featured as The First Lady Collection at a fashion show at the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel.; Lynne is an advocate of reading aloud to children to inspire their interest in literature. As first lady, she toured Hawaii stating, \\"I want every child in the state to be read to everyday.\\" She was the co-founder, and is president, of Read To Me International. While her husband was governor, she helped found the Hawaii Children‚Äôs Museum as honorary chair. In 1987, she was honorary chairman of the development of the Okinawa Cultural Center \\"Okinawa Bunka Kaikan\\" when it was first constructed in Waipio, Hawaii.; During her 8 years as First Lady of Hawaii, she routinely put in 18-hour days. She was credited for raising the bar of volunteerism, creating the First Lady's Outstanding Volunteers Program. The national Girl Scouts named her \\"Woman of Distinction\\" for her service in Hawaii. The Adult Friends for Youth presented her with the Service to Hawaii's Youth Award.

For a fixed period, two opponents punch each other in the head as aggressively as possible without evasion.  Use in training  Milling is a training activity used to assess candidates from age 17 for the elite Parachute Regiment of the British Army.Information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, ref. FOI2017/04225 [covering letter], April 2017. It is one of eight physically-demanding assessment events carried out over four days. An instructor in 2014 described milling as \\"arguably the most important event of the [training] course\\" and its \\"flagship event\\".  Procedure  A square milling ring is formed by the seated trainee group, while an officer and two non-commissioned officers observe as judges from a raised platform. Trainees are paired by weight and issued with head-guards, gumshields and 18oz boxing gloves. Each pair are told to punch each other‚Äôs faces as furiously as possible for one minute: \\"You must aim to dominate your opponent with straight punches to the head.\\" Unlike boxing, it is forbidden: to pause in attacking the opponent; to aim at any part of the opponent other than the head; or to evade or block the opponent‚Äôs punches. The guidance notes state: \\"No ducking, parrying or other boxing defence moves are allowed.\\" The clock is paused if a trainee is knocked down or if his nose is broken; any blood is wiped away by staff and the bout resumes. Whereas in amateur boxing (Olympic boxing) the bout is normally awarded to the participant who scores the most hits against the opponent, a bout in milling is awarded to the most aggressive participant. The bouts are filmed (see below for examples) and trainees can buy the DVD as a souvenir.  Purpose  According to the British Army, milling \\"replicates the conditions of stress and personal qualities required in a combat situation\\", and is \\"a test of courage, determination and raw fighting spirit\\". A milling instructor said in 2014 that milling teaches recruits \\"to deliver maximum violence onto their opponent\\". He suggested that the ability to take and throw punches in milling is the same as the ability of soldiers to fire at an enemy when under fire themselves. Briefing trainees before a milling session, Major Mark Swan said:  Injuries  Despite the intensity of milling, the British Army reported in March 2017 that there had been no medical appointments or medical discharges as a result of the activity in the previous five years. A civilian doctor overseeing a milling session said of the practice: \\"I am happy with the steps that have been put in place.\\"  Admission of women and girls  In 2016, Prime Minister David Cameron decided to admit women and girls from age 16 to the infantry from late 2018, including the Parachute Regiment from 2019. In 2017, the Sunday Times reported that females applying to the Regiment would be assessed on the same basis as males, and would be expected to fight in milling with men of similar size and weight: > \\"Women wanting to join the British Army‚Äôs elite Parachute Regiment will be > expected to go toe to toe with men and trade punches for a minute.\\"  See also  * Recruit training * P Company - UK Parachute Regiment training company * British Army * Drill instructor * Amateur boxing  References   External links  * Bruneval Platoon, milling - footage of milling * Arnhem Platoon, milling - footage of milling * 3 Para, milling - footage of milling British Armed Forces ","title":"Milling (military training exercise)"},{"id":"55994893","text":"Ferguson Lake is a lake in the municipality of Temagami, Nipissing District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada.

Currently Italy has a 3.02% vote share. Recently IMF have claimed that Italy's proposed budget which has a deficit of 2.4% of their GDP could lead to a recession that would last till the 2020s Relationship Italy became a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1947 in an effort to revive the economy after World War II. Italy holds a 3.02% vote share within the IMF. In recent years the relationship between Italy and the IMF have been counterproductive. The right winged government coalition has ignored suggestions from the IMF and have also taken a stance against the EU. Populists movements within Italy have sought to increase spending regardless of the nation already running a surplus deficit. Currently Italy is on the brink of another economic crisis if the populist government continues to disregard warnings from the EU and the IMF. Italian economy Italy is regarded to have one of the most disastrous economies in the EU but has been recovering at a moderate since 2013. Italian productivity also lags behind most Westernised countries while employees are working more hours than most but producing less since the 1990s. The IMF report discovered that Italy's poor performance was due to excessive regulation and a lack of R&D; spending. The nonexistence of a stable governing body in Italy hampers Italy's ability at a significant recovery. Italy has one of the largest debts globally, that hit around 2.3 million Euros. In addition to significant debt Italy also faces a substantial double digit rate of unemployment.  IMF warnings to Italy  = Budget crisis = The IMF has warned that the proposed budget in Italy would create backlash across the EU. In October 2018, Italy's populist government announced that it is targeting a deficit of 2.4% of GDP, which triples the value of the previous administration. The government vows to spend more despite already having a substantial debt. This plan also would push Italy's debt higher that its current level of 130% of its GDP, which more than twice than the EU limit that is 60%. The direction that Italy is currently headed could bring forth another financial crisis and also jeopardises the value of the euro. = Danger of a recession = The IMF also warned Italy that the passing of their proposed budget could result in a recession that could last until the mid 2020s. Italy's economy has been in turmoil since 2008 and the IMF predicts that at the current growth rate the anti-EU government will prolong Italy in reaching the economic prosperity it had prior to the collapse. Italy has been growing at just around one percent a year since 2016. Italy runs the risk of a volatile economic situation even at the slightest recession.

The flight was a Bombardier CRJ100ER operated by Brit Air, a regional airline which was a subsidiary of Air France. The aircraft crashed during its landing phase, striking multiple obstacles and then crashed onto a road and bursting into flames. The occupants were evacuated immediately. The pilot was killed in the crash, while 23 survived. The crash was dubbed a miracle flight, as almost all of the occupants survived the crash. The media called the event the \\"Miracle in Brest\\" (French: Les miracul√©s du Nantes-Brest) An investigation led by France's air accident investigation body, the Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), revealed that the crew of Flight 5672 neglected to select the approach mode on the autopilot.Aviation Safety Network (2003). \\"Accident Description\\". As a result, the glideslope was not captured. The aircraft subsequently deviated significantly from its expected flight path, and the issue worsened as the crew failed to monitor the aircraft's altitude. The Ground Proximity Warning System sounded the alarm, and the aircraft crashed and burst into flames. The crash was the third recorded hull loss of a Bombardier CRJ-100. Flight The aircraft was operating a regular domestic passenger flight from Nantes to Brest under an Instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. It was carrying 21 passengers, two cockpit crew (a Captain and a First Officer) and one cabin crew member. The flight took off at 21:16 local time, 50 minutes later than scheduled. During the cruise segment of the flight, storms were brewing in the area. Cumulonimbus clouds were reportedly present with a cloud base at 200 ft. The crew had to deviate slightly from the planned route to avoid a storm system near Brest, Guipavas. The weather information in Brest indicated that the visibility was 800 meters and that fog was present. At 21:39, air traffic control cleared the crew to descend the aircraft to an altitude of then later to enter a holding pattern. At 21:47, approximately 90 seconds before the start of the planned holding pattern, the controller cleared the crew to descend to and to continue the approach. Shortly after, the autopilot captured the ILS localizer, which is an instrument landing system that is used to guide the aircraft along the axis of the runway, and the crew prepared for landing. The controller stated that he would clear the aircraft to land after the crew reported their position. =Accident= Brest Airport Runway 26L, the runway intended by Flight 5672 to land At 21:48, the First Officer extended the flaps and the aircraft was stabilized at 2,000 ft. While the aircraft was stabilized, wind blowing from the northwest began to shift it from its route, pushing the aircraft to the left, something the crew failed to notice. At 21:49, the crew lowered the flaps to their final landing position and performed the pre-landing checklist. At 21:51, while at an altitude of about during the approach to land, the aircraft's Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded the \\"sink rate\\" alarm. The Captain then disengaged the autopilot and the aircraft continued its descent. At 100 ft the GPWS then warned the crew to \\"pull up\\". The captain called for a go-around and the crew added thrust to the engines. At 21:51:22, Flight 5672 touched down on a grass field near the airport at a low speed. The Bombardier CRJ-100 then skidded and slammed into a wooded embankment. It then struck trees, causing the tip of the left wing to detach. Fire immediately broke out on the left wing. It then hit a concrete wall, causing the right wing and one of the aircraft doors to detach. The aircraft finally stopped after it hit a pole. =Evacuation= After the aircraft stopped, a fire began to spread. Intense fire developed inside the aircraft mostly to the left-hand side. Passengers witnessed the fire spread into the cabin through the sidewalls. The flight attendant opened the cockpit door and saw huge hull breaches in the cockpit. She ordered the passengers to evacuate through the missing right service door. During the evacuation, several passengers still could not find the way out. Two passengers ran to the aft end of the cabin. They were later told by another passenger that there was no emergency exit at the back. A regular flyer of Flight 5672, who was seated at the center of the aircraft, opened the left emergency door. He realized that there was an intense fire on the left wing and decided to leave by the door. The flames then entered the aircraft through the opened emergency exit. The copilot evacuated from the cockpit through the hole that had been formed by the impact. The flight attendant exited the aircraft and assisted in the evacuation from the outside. The aircraft was evacuated in less than one minute. The evacuation went well as the cabin lighting and the fire enabled the passengers to find the exits in a timely manner. =Rescue operation= The control tower personnel reported to Brest Airport's fire brigade that they had lost all contact with Flight 5672 and fire crews began to search for the crash site. At 21:56, the fire brigade contacted Brest's city fire brigade. They later received phone calls from the passengers and crew of Flight 5672 that the aircraft had crashed near the airport. The fire services arrived at the crash site at 22:18. The copilot and a passenger were taken to a nearby hospital while the others were taken to the airport terminal. After being examined by doctors, some of them were later taken to a hospital for further treatment. The captain was the only fatality. Nine others were injured. Investigation Hours after the crash, the flight recorders were found in good condition. They were later sent to Paris for analysis. The FDR and CVR analyses were explained as follows: At 21:44, the crew of Flight 5672 were told by Brest Tower to perform the holding pattern in response to the deteriorating weather in Brest. Flight 5672 was later cleared for the approach. The captain then began to arm the approach mode by selecting the heading mode. He later changed the navigation source to VOR and then activated the ILS frequency. These actions should only be done while arming the autopilot approach mode. However, after the captain activated the ILS frequency, the approach mode had not been armed. The crew should have armed the approach mode by pressing the approach button. Had it been armed at that moment, Flight 5672 would have captured the localize beam. The wind then began to cause Flight 5672 to drift left. At 21:48, Flight 5672 exited the localize beam. While the crew was attempting to regain the altitude, the aircraft deviated further from its planned track. The localize deviation number rose to +1.75. After the aircraft \\"captured\\" the glide slope from above, the Captain armed the approach mode. However, it was too late, and no capture occurred. Believing that the glide slope had been captured, the crew shifted their attention to the horizontal navigation. As Flight 5672 descended, multiple alarms and warnings began to sound. The captain then announced \\"go-around\\" and added more thrust to the engines. However, due to the low airspeed at the time, the aircraft failed to ascend. Flight 5672 later hit the ground and burst into flames. =Conclusion and recommendations= The BEA released its final report and concluded that the crash was caused by pilot error, specifically: *failure to select the APPR mode at the start of the approach *failure to detect flight path deviations *continuing a non-stabilised approach down to the decision altitude. A contributing factor was the change of strategy by the controller managing the flight. The BEA issued 13 recommendations to the General Directorate of Civil Aviation and Brit Air.

She is known for her research on how human memory is encoded and retrieved, with a specific interest in how false memories develop. In collaboration with Henry L. (Roddy) Roediger III, she developed the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm used to study the phenomenon of memory illusions. McDermott received the 2004-2005 F.J. McGuigan Young Investigator Prize for research on memory from the American Psychological Foundation and the American Psychological Association's Science Directorate. She was recognized by the Association for Psychological Science as a Rising Star in 2007. McDermott is a Fellow of the Psychonomic Society and was honored with a 2019 Psychonomic Society Mid-Career Award.  Biography  McDermott received her Bachelors of Art degree in Psychology at the University of Notre Dame. She then went to graduate school at Rice University where she completed her M.A and Ph.D under the advisement of Roediger. Upon graduating from Rice University in 1996, she completed a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine where she applied functional neuroimaging techniques to the study of human cognitive processes. McDermott subsequently joined the faculty at Washington University in St. Louis where she holds the title Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences.  Research  McDermott is best known for her work with Roediger in which they developed and refined a free recall task for the purpose of eliciting false memories ( the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm). Roediger and McDermott replicated a 1959 study by James Deese; participants were given a list of semantically related words (e.g., bed, snore, alarm, pillow, night, dream, wake, snooze, blanket, relax) and later asked to recall the words. They observed that participants were likely to recall semantic associates of the words on the list on an immediate free recall task: For example, participants often falsely recalled the word sleep when shown a list of words related to sleep, and they displayed a high level of confidence that the word sleep had been on the list. Roediger and McDermott suggested that participants confuse their memory of producing the word during the free recall test with having previously seen the word in the list. McDermott applied fMRI to examine neural activity associated with false memory generation in the Deese-Roediger- McDermott paradigm. She and her colleagues observed similar patterns of activity in the parietal memory network when participants recall words that were on the list (true items) and those that were falsely recalled items (semantic lures). Such findings fit with predictions of the fuzzy-trace theory, suggesting that individuals utilize memory representations that record the gist of experiences rather than on memory representations of verbatim content. In other work, McDermott and her colleagues used fMRI to create a map of human neural activity associated with word, object, and face encoding. They observed differential patterns of activation in the frontal cortex and medial temporal lobe what varied as a function of the stimuli to be encoded (verbal or non-verbal), with greater left-lateralization of the dorsal frontal cortex for word encoding, bilateral activation for object encoding, and greater right-lateralization activation for face encoding. In work with Karl Szpunar and Jason Watson, McDermott mapped patterns of neural activity associated with the act of envisioning personally significant events, such as one's birthday. They observed that a set of regions within the left lateral premotor cortex, left precuneus, and right posterior cerebellum activate more strongly when the participant envisions future events compared to recollecting past events. They also noticed that when participants envisioned a future event, a set of regions including the bilateral posterior cingulate, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, and left occipital cortex, which are associated with remembering previously encountered visual-spatial contexts is also activated. Such findings suggests that participants tend to envision future scenarios in well known visual-spatial contexts, with similar patterns of neural activation coinciding with remembering the past and imagining the future.

He is widely believed either to have been murdered or to be in hiding in the Caribbean. Gang activity Wynter worked as an enforcer for the Adams family crime syndicate. In 1994, allegedly with assistance from fellow enforcer and future crime boss Ray Barton, he murdered drug dealer Claude Moseley with a samurai sword, as punishment for pocketing profits from a drug operation run by the Adams family. He went on trial for the murder, but key witnesses refused to give evidence against him, one preferring to go to jail for contempt of court, and the case was dropped. Disappearance On 9 March 1998, Wynter left the house he shared with his girlfriend, driving off in her Nissan Micra. Later that day, he spoke to her by phone, but did not disclose his location. Wynter was never seen again, and the car was subsequently discovered abandoned in June. His bank account, credit card and mobile phone have not been used since then. Theories There are two main theories for the disappearance, both hinging on a cannabis deal where ¬£800,000 went missing. Either Wynter doublecrossed the Adams family, stole the money and accordingly was killed in retribution (allegedly being buried in the foundations of the Millennium Dome), or fled to the Caribbean with the money and remained in hiding. Related deaths Saul Nahome, financial advisor to the Adams family, was gunned down in front of his house by an unknown assailant on 5 December 1998. Initially, it was claimed that he was murdered by the Adams gang, due to fears he might crack under police pressure and inform on the rest of the gang. Police at the time dismissed this, claiming that most likely he was killed by a rival gang in order to cause disruption. However, Nahome and Wynter knew each other personally, had worked together in the past, and Nahome was allegedly involved in the same cannabis deal as Wynter, and so police now believe that Wynter's disappearance and Nahome's murder are related. In 2011, police reexamined evidence and questioned crime boss Terry Adams and 20 other gang members including former ally Barton about both men, but with no results. It has been suggested that former Adams family enforcer and Bristol drug baron Andrew Baker was responsible for the murder of both men.https://thebristolcable.org/series/cornerman/episode/unmasking-the- cornerman See also *List of fugitives from justice who disappeared *List of people who disappeared References 1960s births 1990s missing person cases British jewellers Missing people Missing person cases in England ","title":"Gilbert Wynter"},{"id":"55995249","text":"Natalie King (born 1966) is an Australian curator and writer working in Melbourne, Australia.

Life Jeanne Charlotte du Lu√ßay was married to count Jean-Baptiste-Charles Legendre de Lu√ßay (1754-1836), prefect at the Imperial court. =Dame de Palais= She belonged to those appointed ladies-in-waiting when the first Imperial Household was composed for empress Jos√©phine after the introduction of the monarchy in 1804: Ad√©la√Øde de La Rochefoucauld was created Dame d'honneur and √âmilie de Beauharnais Dame d'atours, while Jeanne Charlotte du Lu√ßay, along with Madame de R√©musat, Elisabeth Baude de Talhou√´t, Madame Lauriston, Madame d'Arberg, Marie Antoinette Duch√¢tel, Sophie de Segur, Madame S√©ran, Madame Colbert, Madame Savary and Agla√© Louise Augui√© Ney was made Dame du palais. She participated in the coronation of Napoleon and Josephine on 2 December 1804. She was tasked to receive Catharina of W√ºrttemberg upon her wedding to J√©r√¥me Bonaparte in 1807. General Durand described Jeanne Charlotte du Lu√ßay as a pretty, well-mannered person who avoided to harm her enemies and had the courage to stand up and defend those not present when slander was uttered against them, and well suited for court service. She was known for her good taste, and was a fashion icon who often launched the latest fashion in high society, which was then followed by others. =Dame d'atour= When Napoleon divorced Josephine and remarried to Marie Louise, Jeanne Charlotte du Lu√ßay was assigned to be a part of the entourage to Branua to receive Marie Louise and escort her to Napoleon in Compi√®gne. When the household of Marie Louise was formed, her superior Ad√©la√Øde de La Rochefoucauld was replaced by Louise Antoinette Lannes, Duchess of Montebello, and du Lu√ßay succeeded √âmilie de Beauharnais as Dame d'atour, while the Duchesse de Bassano, Comtesses de Montmorency, Madame Mortemart, Madame de Bouille, Madame Talhouet, Madame Lauriston, Madame Duchatel, Madame Montalivert, Madame Peron, Madame Lascaris, Madame Noailles, Madame Ventimiglia, Madame Brignole, Madame Gentili, and Madame Canisy were named Dame du palais. As Dame d'atour, she was second in rank of all the ladies-in-waiting to the empress, responsible for her wardrobe and jewels and supervising the expenses and business transactions connected to them. Because of the lack of interest of her superior, the Duchess of Montebello, she also took over her task of administrating the alms and charities of the empress. She was present during the birth of the King of Rome 20 March 1811. Jeanne Charlotte du Lu√ßay remained in service to Marie Louise until she left her at Rambouillet the 11 April 1814, after the abdication of Napoleon and before the departure of Marie Louise to Austria. Her spouse temporarily regained his court office during the Hundred Days in 1815, but after this, de couple du Lu√ßay retired to private life.

The fire was first reported on December 7, 2017, burned , and destroyed 157 structures, before it was fully contained on December 16. The fire cost at least $8.9 million (2018 USD), including $5 million in firefighting expenses and property damage, and an additional $3.9 million in cleanup and erosion control costs. The fire threatened the communities of Bonsall, Oceanside, Vista, Fallbrook, and Camp Pendleton. During the fire, an estimated 10,000 residents were forced to evacuate, while a total of over 100,000 residents were forced to or advised to evacuate. On December 7, the Lilac Fire also cut the power to 20,000 people. Events The Lilac Fire was reported on December 7, 2017, at 11:15 am PST, as a small brush fire, just off Interstate 15. The fire was spotted near Old Highway 395 and Dulin Road, near the intersection between State Route 76 and Interstate 15, in Bonsall, San Diego County, California. Fanned by unusually powerful Santa Ana winds, with gusts reaching , the wildfire quickly grew in size; within minutes, the wildfire grew to 50 acres. By 11:35 AM PST, the Lilac Fire had reached . The winds pushed the fire west towards Oceanside and Vista. During that afternoon, the Lilac Fire left nearly 20,000 San Diego Gas & Electric customers without power. The Lilac Fire expanded to by the evening, with 0% containment. Around that time, there were concerns that the Lilac Fire could burn all the way to the Pacific Ocean, near Camp Pendleton. On the day the fire was reported, Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for San Diego County, due to the fire, stating, ‚ÄúThe fire is very dangerous and spreading rapidly, but we‚Äôll continue to attack it with all we‚Äôve got. It's crucial residents stay ready and evacuate immediately if told to do so.‚Äù Cal State San Marcos, Palomar College, and MiraCosta College canceled classes and closed for the rest of the week.

On December 10, the Lilac Fire's burn area remained at , with containment increasing to 75%. Assessments revealed that the fire had destroyed 151 buildings, while damaging 56 others. Despite strong Santa Ana winds picking up again across Southern California and near the Lilac Fire, the winds failed to materialize around the Lilac Fire's burn area, which allowed firefighters to make significant progress on containing the fire. Firefighters strengthened containment lines with the help of good weather. Due to the increase in fire containment, and the waning Santa Ana winds, all evacuation orders and road closures for the Lilac Fire were lifted at about 4:00 PM PST on December 10. On December 11, the Lilac Fire was 90% contained, with no further increases in size. On December 14, containment of the Lilac Fire had increased to 98%.

Soon after the Lilac Fire had ignited, multiple motorists reported spotting a thin line of fire off Interstate 15, with the flames about 1 foot high and no longer than \\"a double-wide bed.\\" Although investigators managed to narrow the origin point of the Lilac Fire down to a 1-square-foot area, they were unable to find anything that they could use to determine the fire's cause. Despite the many reports they received from motorists near the start of the fire, investigators were still unable to find a solid lead on the fire's cause. Investigators stated that the cause of the Lilac Fire may never be known without more tips from the public, but also stated that whoever started the fire may have done so unknowingly; a truck that was generating sparks from dragging a metal chain is a possible cause.

Her research has focused on evolutionary and developmental genetics. She is known for demonstrating that germ cells engage in cell to cell competition before becoming a gamete, which indicates that natural selection can affect and change genetic material before adult sex reproduction takes place. She was also the Director of EDEN (the Evo-Devo-Eco Network), a National Science Foundation-funded research collaborative that encouraged scientists working on organisms other than the standard lab model organisms to share protocols and techniques. Early life Extavour has described growing up in a mixed race household, her father being from Trinidad and Tobago and her mother from Switzerland and Hungary, as being \\"critical\\" to her identity. Her father co-founded a Canadian celebration in 1987 to celebrate the legacy of late American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr.. She said she was \\"so proud\\" of her dad's role in helping to bring King's message to the Black community in Toronto. Her father also played in an Afro- Caribbean band and would put her on stage with him at age five. He encouraged her to learn to play the flute, violin, steel pan, recorder, and percussion. She didn't realize she had a knack for science until high school. She did well in her math and science classes and that led her to consider a career in science when she had only ever thought of being a musician or a baker. Initially she was interested in psychology and neuroscience due to a friend's interest in the area. Her interest in developmental genetics began with a summer internship in the lab of Joe Culotti at the University of Toronto. Science career Extavour received an Honors BSc at the University of Toronto. Her Ph.D. thesis was on germ cell selection in genetic mosaics and was published in 2001 in PNAS. In 2003 Extavour did a study at Cambridge University on the mechanisms of germ cell formation that showed animal germ cells were likely specified by inductive signals more often than previously thought. This went against the mainstream scientific view at the time that animal germ cells are usually specified by maternally inherited determinants. During a 2013 interview with Quanta Magazine, she explained the concepts of this research as such: \\"Before there is even an embryo, the molecular content of some cells predetermines them to develop as either germ or soma. In other organisms, there is instead a signaling mechanism: An embryonic cell receives chemical signals from neighboring cells that activate (or repress) the genes that allow for germ-line function.\\" In 2007 she started her independent laboratory in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University as an Assistant Professor. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 2011 and to Full Professor in 2014. Some of Extavour's research during this period showed that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) can help to induce primordial germ cells (PGCs) in the early stages of embryo development in a cricket. Extavour and her colleagues were able to specify that two BMPs, BMP8b and BMP4, help induce PGCs in this insect. This is significant because it was the first demonstration of a specific signaling pathway operating in the induction of embryonic germ cells in an Invertebrate.Derivation of male germ cells from induced pluripotent stem cells by inducers: A review From 2010-2015 Extavour directed a national research collaborative called EDEN, which stands for Evo-Devo-Eco (evolutionary-developmental-ecological) Network. The organization, funded by the National Science Foundation, encouraged scientists to develop and share tools and techniques for use in a broader spectrum of organisms than the traditionally studied laboratory model organisms. Extavour believes that a number of deep evolutionary questions cannot be answered by examining only one organism, and thus hopes that science will move past the model organism paradigm.

The vertical mobility can be the change in social status between parents and children, which is intergenerational movement; as well as the change over the course of a lifetime, which is intragenerational movement. After World War II, Japan‚Äôs economy grew rapidly and stably. Japan achieved the high employment rate among developed countries as well as established a relatively equal class structure due to the rapid economy growth as well as its life-time employment system, progressive tax policies, and social security policies. Not only did the huge middle class establish the image of Japan‚Äôs ‚Äúaffluent society‚Äù, but also maintained the long-term stability of the running Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, and verified the proposition that industrialization narrows down the social stratification. In the early 1970s, Japan even created the myth of ‚Äú100 million all in the middle class‚Äù (‚Äúichi oku sochuryu‚Äù), showing that social satisfaction reached a high level and the middle class awareness maintained long-term stability. One factor that contributed to social mobility in Japan was the rapid economic growth between 1955 and 1985 with Japan‚Äôs industrial structure changes. However, after the bubble economy burst in 1990, Japan entered a period of development stagnation known as \\"The Lost Decade.\\" Therefore, the occupational prestige, education levels, and assets among different social classes still existed and were not eliminated by industrialization. The trend of class stratification first appeared in the 1980s, and the main manifestations included the stagnation of equalized distribution, the fixation of employment patterns, and the narrowing gap between occupations. Therefore, wages and salaries were no longer the main variables in the economic stratification; instead, the difference in household assets became increasingly important in the economic stratification. During the bubble economy in the late 1980s, the huge wealth brought by the substantial appreciation of the Japanese yen was invested in stocks, securities, and real estate. The difference between financial assets and land prices rapidly expanded. Assets replaced wage income and became the determining factor of people‚Äôs economic status and consumption patterns. In 1980, Murakami Yasusuke put forward the concept of \\"The Age of New Middle Mass Politics\\", where the middle class was defined as \\"middle level of standard of living\\", \\"conservative ideology\\", and a sign of social stability. However, middle class was largely influenced and destabilized by the bubble economy burst in 1990, causing the instability of the whole society. Furthermore, the implementation of public policies including employment policies, tax policies, and social security policies also contributed to a relatively equal class structure in Japanese society. First, in the 1960s, Japan's total unemployment rate remained at around 1% and raised to 1.3% after 1973. During this period, due to the drastic changes in the industrial structure, industries and enterprises kept upgrading and the unemployment during this period mainly consisted of structural unemployment. The employment measures were mainly aimed at consolidating the life-time employment system, protecting the disadvantaged groups, and improving the labor market. Second, Japan's progressive tax system also resulted in the redistribution effect of personal income tax. The Japanese tax system was characterized by a high tax threshold and a steep increase in tax progressivity, creating high tax rate for high- income classes and low tax rate for low-income classes. Lastly, Japan's social security system also contributed to income redistribution effect. In 1961, Japan had established a comprehensive social security system - \\"national health insurance and pension schemes\\", when all Japanese people were finally covered. The most significant effect of redistribution under the social insurance schemes is the subsistence guarantee of low-income and disable people.

The original video was uploaded to YouTube by user Brian Spinney on February 5, 2013 and garnered wider attention through the website Reddit.

The street is named for Julien de Lallande Poydras. Many of the city of New Orleans' and the state of Louisiana's tallest buildings have been built on the street since it was widened in the mid 1960s. The street also hosts several historic structures and is the boundary between two United States National Register of Historic Places districts. History Poydras Street in 1962 before it was widened and before De Soto (Le Pavillon) Hotel renovation The street is named for Julien de Lallande Poydras, who helped Louisiana achieve statehood, served as the first President of the Louisiana State Senate, and Delegate from the Territory of Orleans to the United States House of Representatives, Eleventh Congress (March 4, 1809 ‚Äî March 3, 1811). The street traces back to 1788 when it was first laid out, but its prominence traces back to its transformation that began in the 1960s. In the 1890s, Poydras Street and Canal Street were early hosts of municipal lighting when gigantic spotlights in steel light towers were erected upon them by Muller Co. In 1927, when its width measured , the movement to widen it was begun by consultants for the City Planning Commission. The street hosted the Poydras Market from 1838 to 1932. As urban planning evolved, Poydras became the logical 4-lane connection between Expressways. It took until 1964 for a bond issue to pass that would acquire the properties to widen the street as had been recommended in 1927. From November 23, 1964 until August 16, 1966, demolition, drainage installation, utility connection, paving, sidewalk construction and landscaping occurred, resulting in a six-lane wide street. Many factors combined to give Poydras Street its prominent place in urban transit, including the erection of the Louisiana Superdome at one end and the Rivergate Exhibition Hall at the Mississippi River end in the late 1960s and the construction of One Shell Square in 1972. Subsequently, more than a dozen skyscrapers were erected along the street that has become a central area circulator for vehicular traffic and host of modern high-rise construction. The street currently accommodates a Spaghetti Junction near the Superdome that provides access to U.S. Route 90, Interstate 10 and U.S. Route 90 Business. The Street hosts various stops for the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority streetcar lines: Riverfront, Rampart‚ÄìSt. Claude and St. Charles. According to the Port of New Orleans, the Canal and Poydras Street Wharves hosts a long and deep berth used for river boat harbor excursion tours.

It was released on April 6, 2017. A companion series of one-ounce silver medals bearing the same designs was released on October 6 later that year. The design of the coin, which was the first minted depiction of Lady Liberty portrayed as an African-American woman, sparked a national conversation as a record-high number of viewers watched the U.S. Mint's live-streamed unveiling in January 2017. The 2017 coin was a result of the exploration of concepts for a new and modern Liberty and was directly inspired by the controversial 2015 African American Liberty designed by another AIP artist. The 2015 design had been recommended by the Commission of Fine Arts for the 2015 American Liberty high relief gold union, but was ultimately not chosen to be minted.  Advocacy  In 2014, the U.S. Mint issued a proposal to strike an ultra high-relief gold coin and silver medal companion series. On July 22, 2014 the proposal was approved by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC). The gold coins were approved without oversight from the U.S. Congress under the Mint's existing statutory legal authority, and the silver medals were granted through the authority of the Treasury Secretary. The CCAC's recommendation for the 2017 coin became a subject of controversy as it was the first time that an African-American would be depicted as Lady Liberty on a U.S. Coin. Some coin collectors directed their criticism towards President Obama's administration, despite the fact that the coin and its design were decided solely between the US Mint and the CCAC. Nevertheless, the gold coin's design was unveiled in January 2017 and became available for purchase in July of the same year.  Specifications  *Presentation Case: Black lacquered hardwood *Edge: Lettered *Weight: 31.108 grams *Diameter: 30.61 mm *Finish: Proof *Composition: 99.99% Gold *Content: .9999 fine  Description  The design of the gold coin and its companion silver medal was chosen by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee from over 20 rival candidate designs, many of which were also intended to reflect the diversity by which American culture and values have evolved over time. The chosen design was strongly preferred by the committee, with members stating that it represented a \\"21st Century, modern representation of liberty\\" with emotional impact to contemporary Americans. The obverse of the gold coin features Lady Liberty, portrayed as a youthful, African-American woman, wearing a crown of stars. It is also inscribed with the words \\"LIBERTY\\" behind Lady Liberty's hair, \\"1792\\", \\"2017\\", and \\"IN GOD WE TRUST\\". The obverse was designed by Mint Artistic Fusion Program (AIP) Designer Justin Kunz and engraved by Mint Sculptor-Engraver Phebe Hemphill. The reverse of the coin features an American bald eagle flying left to right, and was designed by AIP Designer Chris Costello and engraved by Michael Gaudioso. The coin was struck at the West Point Mint, and was the first high-relief coin with a proof finish minted in the United States.  Silver medal  American Liberty 225th Anniversary silver medal The US Mint released a series of .999 fine, 1 ounce silver medals as a companion to its 225th Anniversary Gold Coin.

There is a mintage limit of 100,000 for the gold coins. 14,285 pieces, or 14.3% of the total possible, were sold on the first day that the coin became available on the US Mint catalog. As of May 22, 2019, the coin is still offered by the Mint. The silver medals had first day sales of 26,833 pieces, outperforming its gold counterpart.

His service as consulate general lasted from 1887 to 1902. Ho Yow was born in Hong Kong to a wealthy Guangzhou family. After a British education in his hometown, Ho completed his studies in Oxford and Long before returning to Hong Kong to practice law.  Early Years  Ho was born in Hong Kong to Reverend Ho Fuk-tong, an early Chinese missionary under the London Missionary Society. Sir Robert Kai Ho, a Legislative Councilor and community leader, is his brother. He served as an articled clerk to his another brother Wyson Ho, the first Chinese solicitor in Hong Kong between 1887 and 1897. Ho left Hong Kong to the United States in 1897 along with Ng Choy, his brother-in-law and then the Chinese ambassador to the States.  Chinese Consulate General  At the age of 28, Ho was appointed as vice consul of the San Francisco Chinese Consulate to general consul Chang Yin Tang in 1897. Ho was soon promoted to consulate general, with the goal increasing trade relations between the United States and China, serving to the prosperity of Chinatown merchants. The arrival of this new consul general seemed to reenergize the Chinese community of San Francisco especially since his immediate superior, the Chinese minister in Washington, was his brother-in- law. Although a novice, San Francisco reacted favorably to Ho's appointment. He was charming, a \\"good\\" Chinese, fluent in English. Ho quickly achieved social prominence, not only in Chinatown but also in local political, business, and cultural circles. Despite his youth, Ho's mandarin persona impressed members of San Francisco's elite holding membership in the Bohemian Club. As a consul general, Ho Yow had many goals including building new trade relations between the United States and China by opposing the Exclusion Act and recasting Chinatown's image. Notably in 1899, Ho organized a successful Chinese parade during San Francisco's Fourth of July Celebration. Ho published a series of essays advocating for the modernization of China, arguing that Chinese prosperity would increase Chinese demand for foreign goods, turning their economy into capitalist consumers for the United States to benefit from. = Recasting Chinatown's Image = When Ho Yow was appointed as the new vice consul in 1897, he also contributed to merchants' efforts to recast Chinatown's image during the 1900s. He helped Chinese merchants regain the allegiance of Chinatown's residents by fighting the secret society leaders and threatening them. This was all an effort to gain control of the tourism industry and change the tourists' negative view of Chinatown, a view that was influenced by white tour guides. Merchants also joined Consul Ho in complaining to city officials that professional guides had begun to establish fake opium dens and hire Chinese men and women to engage in ‚Äúimmoral exhibitions‚Äù for tourists. For good measure, Consul Ho issued his own list of regulations for Chinese tour guides, including the mandate that Chinese guides were not allowed to show ‚Äúopium dens and whore houses‚Äù to tourists. = Tong Wars = The murder of Fung Jin Toy lead to a tong boycott of the See Yup Company goods, hindering the economy of Chinatown. Ho Yow actively worked to bring an agreement between the parties through his consulship authority, nearly succeeding. = San Francisco plague = On May 16, 1900, after confirmation of several Chinese deaths due to bubonic plague, Ho. along with leaders of the San Francisco Chinese community, recommended vaccinations to their associations and tongs. This recommendation was met with resistance, however Consul Ho and Six Companies tried to calm the concerns. Despite the effort, only 53 Chinese were vaccinated compared to the 530 Japanese and 234 of other races. ‚ÄúClean-up‚Äù efforts moved to a second front in 1900, when health officials discovered the presence of bubonic plague in Chinatown and quarantined the quarter. Chinatown's merchants feared a devastating loss in income from tourists, and they joined Ho in publicly denying the existence of plague. The presumed emergence of plague was an embarrassment to residents. A traditional Chinese maxim counseled that shame should be covered up. Admission of the presence of plague was embarrassing to them, so they tried to hide any evidence of plague. Upon learning of attempts to hide bodies, many public figures derided the Chinese by calling them \\"heathens\\". Ho knew that he represented those that fled and hid from the interventions of the white doctors, however Ho denied that his people were actually sick. In an attempt to conciliate non-Chinese authorities, Ho advised Chinese who were sick to seek a \\"white physician\\", and if one could not afford that, an Oriental Dispensary doctor would be provided to them free of cost. Ho Consul Ho Yow and the Six Companies remained defiant; they had threatened to file a legal injunction to stop the quarantine before it was lifted. Later, an autopsy of a monkey confirming findings of plague diagnosis made federal officials, the Chinese leadership, and press representatives consider another quarantine. However, San Francisco's sanitarians were content just to follow up with their search and disinfection campaign instead of supporting another closure. Ho reluctantly agreed to support the planned sanitary campaign, offering the assistance of several hundred residents. He issued a proclamation to his countrymen explaining the need for the impending search because not only would it prevent plague but also avoid another disruptive quarantine. = The Exclusion Act = In the fall of 1901, Ho and Chinese minister Wu Tingfang shifted their attentions to the Exclusion Act, set to expire on May 5, 1902. Their thesis was that the current American legal approach toward Chinese immigration remained an obstacle to expanded and preferential trade, sustaining resentment and hostility between people of both nations. He explained that American labor and the unions opposed the entry of Chinese workers into the country because they profited from a scarcity of labor. Yet these foreign migrants contributed in their own way to the productivity and wealth on the Pacific Coast. In Ho's view, Congress had passed the exclusion laws to appease organized labor even though the Chinese were actually not real competitors; they were essentially menial labors. The consul declared the current lack of assimilation an asset rather than a deficiency: living in separate colonies, the Chinese were not interested in intruding into American domestic life. = Boxer Rebellion = The Boxer Rebellion in China prompted worries of an anti-Chinese backlash in San Francisco. Ho aimed to ease fears by stated his opinion that anti-Chinese sentiments by health officials did not increase. In a further attempt to reduce anti-Chinese sentiment, Ho along with all the presidents of Chinatown associations along with 200 Chinese merchants, provided an official statement denouncing the Boxers. = End of Consulship = Six Companies had filed grievances against Ho, and sent a list of complaints against Ho to the Chinese Imperial government. One of the complaints was the taking of bribes. Another concern was his lack of aggression during the debates on extending the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Chinese Exclusion Act was extended for 10 more years. Ho's title as consulate general was recalled by the Imperial government in 1902.  Chinese-American Commercial Company  After the termination from his consul position, Ho would then become manager and vice president of the Chinese-American Commercial Company. Incorporated in California backed by $1 million in gold by local and state bank presidents, the company was also international.The company had several offices in cities including Hong Kong, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York.

The trial speech by Hypereides against Philippides lasted just over thirty minutes and is taken from the papyrus where epilogue is preserved in its entirety. It states that Philippides campaigned with King Philip II of Macedon, which was his most serious offense, and did everything in the service of the Macedonians which Hypereides detested. Philippides was known as saying, \\"We must honor Alexander for all those that died at his hand\\". Hypereides attacks Philip and Alexander during the first half of the speech, the second half he turns his attack on Philippides. A reference suggest that Philip was alive at the time of the trial. Philippides was also involved in embassies to King Cassander.. In 294/3 B.C. Stratocles moved a decree in honour of Philippides, who had been active under the late government. In Olympiodoros' second year as eponymous archon, the archon basileus was Philippides of Paiania, a wealthy elder statesman of nobility. He took part in the established Athenian coalition government with military leader Olympiodoros and pro-Macedonian democrat Stratocles. Philippides of Paiania was one of the richest Athenians in the age of Lycurgus of Athens.

Life Magn√∫s received no formal education, and spent most of his life as a farmer living on the farm Tjaldanes in Dalas√Ωsla, for which he is named.Driscoll, Matthew James 2013. 'The Long and Winding Road: Manuscript Culture in Late Pre-Modern Iceland'. In: Anna Kuismin & Matthew James Driscoll (eds.), White Field Black Seeds. Nordic Literacy Practices in the Long Nineteenth Century. (Studia Fennica Litteraria 7.) Helsinki: Finnish literary society SKS. Pp. 50-63. Copying Magn√∫s is known today for his extraordinary output as a scribe, copying Icelandic sagas. He is unusual, if not unique, for only copying works in this form (and not, for example, poetry or genealogies). As of 2013, 43 surviving manuscripts by Magn√∫s had been identified, comprising 28,000 pages, or over 6 million words. Magn√∫s appears to have begun copying in his teens, but the datable manuscripts are from the period 1874-1916 (though nine are undated and seem to be from before 1874). In total, these contain copies of 171 different sagas‚Äîthe majority of which Magn√∫s copied two to four times. Moreover, at least some (perhaps half) of Magn√∫s's output is now lost. The sagas that Magn√∫s copied range across the main genres, and include all or nearly all the fornaldars√∂gur and medieval Icelandic chivalric sagas, along with 28 post-medieval fornaldars√∂gur and nearly 50 post-medieval romances; 13 translations of German chapbooks; and 10 √çslendingas√∂gur (with other copies known to have been lost). About half of Magn√∫s's surviving manuscripts contain prefaces indicating who he got his exemplars from, naming about 100 individuals. Although Magn√∫s sometimes copied from printed editions, he specified when he did so that he knew the text to have circulated in manuscript form. Like other scribes in the Icelandic saga tradition, Magn√∫s habitually altered the wording of sagas that he copied, though without changing the essentials of the plot; and at times, he seems to have written sagas from memory entirely in his own wording, and sometimes with major changes to the plot, as in his copy of N√≠t√≠√∞a saga in Reykjav√≠k, Lbs 1510 4to.Sheryl McDonald Werronen, 'Two Major Groups in the Older Manuscript Tradition of N√≠t√≠√∞a saga', Saga-Book, 38 (2014), 75-94 (p. 83 fn 4); . Influence Perhaps twelve sagas are known solely from Magn√∫s's copying. Magn√∫s supplied the text for the printed edition of Sk√°ld-Helga saga published by Sigf√∫s Eymundsson (1837‚Äì1911) in 1897, and in 1909 the National Library of Iceland spent around half its acquisitions budget for the year on a twenty- volume set of his Fornmannas√∂gur nor√∞urlanda (250 kr√≥nur). In recent years, Magn√∫s's work has attracted growing scholarly interest.Driscoll, Matthew James 1997.

Eryniopsis lampyridarum is mind controlling for the soldier beetle and can manipulate the beetle into doing things that it wouldn't normally do. Once the fungus has established itself inside the beetle, it sends the infected beetle on a mission to find a specific daisy flower Asteraceae. The soldier beetle will clamp its mouthpiece onto the flower as tight as it can, while it awaits its death. The parasitic fungus forces the dead beetle to then spread its wings wide in a dramatic pose; this makes the beetle look bigger as if it is seeking out a mate. The fungus makes sure the dying beetle will attract more beetles so it can spread its spores. The fungus makes sure the beetle spreads its wings only at daybreak. It is also strange that the beetle will be dead for hours and then suddenly it will spread its wings at daylight, just in time to attract potential mates to its dead body. This is because the fungus is in control of the beetle's body functions. Then, when an uninfected beetle comes along to socialize with the dead beetle, the fungus' spores spread to the new beetle. Not all beetles will end up at a daisy flower. Some will die and fall to the ground. In this case, the parasitic fungus creates many spores that will be resistant to the environment and remain infective for many months. The spores will remain infective in the soil, awaiting the next season where they can infect more soldier beetles. This parasite was first discovered in North Carolina in the late 1970s, early 1980s. It has been found only in eastern and central North America, although its host, the soldier beetle, is found in southern Canada as well.

Synopsis Every night at 10, Kolkata tunes into radio to listen to 'Kuchh Bheege Alfaaz' ‚Äì an episodic series of unrequited love stories hosted by RJ Alfaz who, despite his tremendous following, prefers staying detached and anonymous. Among his many fans is the boisterous Archana (Geetanjali Thapa), a girl working at a creative agency ‚Äì which designs branded memes. She is leukodermic but lives life to the fullest. They meet; or rather talk, for the first time over a misplaced call when Archana accidentally dials Alfaaz's (Zain Khan Durrani) number, while trying to connect with her latest blind date. Thus begins an interesting relationship between two unlikely characters, one overly compensating, but in denial of her present, and the other buried under a dark secret of his past.

The stephes, which are based on variants of the metre ferskeytt, are often very sentimental.

Shridhara was a puranik, that is one who recite stories from Puranas. Later he began to compose works himself in a simple devotional style, and were not only extremely popular, but were revered and worshipped like sacred texts. Biography Shridhara was born to a Kulkarni belonging to Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin (DRB) family in 1658 CE in Nazare a village in Solapur district, Maharashtra state. His father Brahmananda Kadke, was also his guru with some literary works such as Atma Prakash in 1681, a vedanta. It is in the form of Ovi poetry and is divided in 14 chapters. Shridhara added 32 stanzas as a prologue to it. Shridhara was also called as Nazarekar because his father was a Kulkarni at Nazare in Sholapur district, but they hail from Khadki. Later they shifted to Pandharpur from Nazare in his early days of his life. Shridhara turned to literary composer in the middle age. He first composed Harivijaya in 1702, an abridged version of Shrikrishna charita, based on Bhagavata and Padma Purana. Then followed RamVijaya in 1703, an abridged adaptation of Ramayana. Then after a lapse of ten years or so appeared PandavaPratap in 1712, an abridged version of Mahabharata. The last to appear in his series was Shivlilamrut, based mainly on Skanda Purana. All these compositions are written in a simple, chaste style. He had correctly anticipated common man as his reader, and common man has ever been grateful to him for these writings. They not only read but worshipped these compositions like holy scriptures. Shridhar's popularity is quite a phenomenon in Marathi literature. There were many Marathi poets before and after him, who had worked on mythological themes, Mahanubhava poets like Bhaskarabhatta, Borikar and Narendra, Eknath, Mukteshwara ( from whose version of Mahabharata Shridhara himself had borrowed liberally and literally), Raghunath Pandit, Samraj and Nagesh. Moropant alone among them had condensed all the three epics, Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Bhagavata, but his compositions in ƒÄryƒÅ metre addressed pandits well versed in Sanskrit, but could not reach the masses. Shridhara did not belong to the category of saint-poets or pandit-poets. And yet he was the only one among them who could reach out so well to the masses. His simple abridged versions in the popular Ovi meter appealed to their taste. Literary works Shridhar Swami is famous for composing works in a simple devotional style. His popularity cuts across all castes because of his simplicity of style, narrative power and devotional sentiment. He took known stories from the Ramayana and Mahabharata and narrated them with moral teaching and Vedantic philosophy. The Harivijaya, RamVijaya, Shivlilamrut, PandavaPratap, and the AmbikaUdaya are his major works. His other works include Vedanta- surya, a philosophical text, Panduranga Mahatmya and Venkatesh Mahatmya.

After a year of study, and a published report named Basis of the Social Security System in Guatemala, the Guatemalan legislature created a Social Security Act No. 256 and President Juan Jose Arevalo signed the Institute of Social security into law October 30, 1946. = Pension & Program Evolution =  Work Injury Program  The work related incident pension and income protection for emergencies program was enacted in 1947 and rolled out at the national level between 1948 and 1949. The Program covers all workers insured by the Institute. The work injury program covered 50% of individual earnings and after the 1994 it started covering 66% of earnings. The minimum daily benefit payment is eight Quetzales and the monthly maximum is two thousand four hundred Quetzales.  Maternity Insurance  Instituted in 1953, the Guatemalan maternity insurance represented 50% of earnings and after 1968; 100% of earnings. After the 2005 reforms women would have to have contributed at least three months into their pension fund to receive the maternity benefits. To be a recipient of benefits, women have to contribute one percent of your gross earnings for the rest of your life.  Sickness & Maternity Act (1968)  In 1968 the GISS pension programs were reformed and combined into one program, including the Maternity Insurance program. The reforms included a 2% gross income, for life contribution by individual earners and then employers contribute 40% of the 2% gross income premium, and the government pays 20% of the 2% gross income premium. The initial program was limited to the department of Guatemala but the coverage was extended to 8 departments in 1979 and to the department of Escuintla in 1989. After the 1994 reforms, the coverage of the pensions listed under the program got extended to the entire country.  Old Age, Disability, & Survivors Program  The Old Age, Disability and Survivors pension structure was place into law in 1969 with the same department coverage as the coverage instituted in the Sickness & Maternity act of 1968. The program saw reforms for national coverage much earlier than the Sickness and Maternity program with legislation to expand it across the 22 departments in 1977. The fund for this program is funded by a 2% gross income contribution for life for salaried employees; 6% of declared earnings for self-employed individuals and 4% of the covered payroll. The state is mandated to pay 25% of the total of contributions to the program but it has never done so.  Constitutional Reform (1985)  The right to Social Security coverage became a constitutional right in Guatemala in Article 100 of the Guatemalan constitution after the constitutional convention of May 1985.  Program Structure & Organization  = Management & Administration =  Executive Board  The Executive Board of the Guatemalan Institute for Social Security constitutes the highest administrative branch of the Social Security programs in Guatemala. It operates under the auspices of the Ministry of Work and Social Provision but it's an autonomous body which enables to take independent decisions. The President of the Institute is appointed by the executive branch; the first and second vice-presidents are appointed by the Central Bank and the State University respectively. The board also has three auxiliary chairs, one is appointed by the Academy of Doctors and Surgeons of Guatemala; another is appointed by the Business Associations; and the last one is appointed by the Labor sector. = Programs =  Program Funding  The Social Security Fund that funds the majority of the cash benefits and the totality of the health services provided by the Guatemalan Institute of Social Security is financed in the following way: * Salaried Employees: 5% of their monthly salary. * Employers: 13% of the overall monthly payroll.  Benefits to Institute Affiliates  * Disability Insurance. * Two thirds of the regular income cash benefits in case of temporary disability caused by emergency. * Maternity leave insurance. * Old age pension. * Cash benefits to households with parents with disabilities. * Sudden Death insurance for both the employer and the family of the deceased.

It covers all EU citizens and also long-term residents with legal status, and its main intention is to shelter those with higher risk of poverty and to guarantee the recipients with basic standard of living. All EU citizens and Cypriots are applicable to the program if they have lived in Cyprus for more than five years before the application and will continue to reside there. Similar with conservative welfare states, Cyprus‚Äôs Minimum Income (MI) Law adopted the principle of subsidiarity, which means that family unit must serve as the first defending line for individuals. For Cyprus‚Äôs MI Law, eligibility for help is based on the total needs of a family unit. A family is qualified for benefits as long as its total income cannot satisfy its total need. Additionally, property ownership is also calculated based on family unit. The assumption is that members inside a family must collaborate and help each other. Only when they together as a social unit cannot afford to live well would the state came to help as the last-resort safety net. Moreover, the basic income value for a person that has zero income reported is set ‚Ç¨480 per month, which is more than half of the respective poverty threshold. The value is set in an ad hoc basis to adapt to varying levels of national income and inflation. Benefits of Cyprus‚Äôs MI Law are given based on means testing. Potential recipients need to apply and demonstrate that they have certifiable needs, and that they‚Äôre really out of means except government support. To truly distribute benefits to those that need them the most, the Cyprus‚Äôs MI Law sets an age limit (above 28 years old) to eliminate young people who‚Äôre not earning much but are enjoying high standard of living with their parents from the list beneficiaries. It also has an activation strategy aimed to encourage the unemployed to actively seek jobs. Recipients would be required to accept available jobs in their relative fields, and those who‚Äôre unemployed voluntarily would be excluded from the program.  Pension system  The Cyprus social security pension system consists of six parts: the General Social Insurance Scheme; the Social Pension Scheme; the Special Allowance to pensioners; the Government Employees Pension Scheme; other Public Sector Employees Pension Schemes; the Voluntary Provident Funds and other similar collective arrangements. Each scheme calculates benefits in different formulations. The General Social Insurance Scheme covers everyone who's gainfully employed in Cyprus with contributory interests. The Government Employees Pension Scheme covers pensions for those who're inside the army and work for the government and is also earning-related. It is notable that while Cyprus pension system do target various social groups, including the self- employed, its employees in private sector still are largely unsheltered. Cyprus pension system also pays specific attention to the elderly, especially those who experienced the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, many of whom have lost their means of life. Legal residents in Cyprus are entitled for pension programs as long as they have lived 20 years in Cyprus after the age of 40 and 35 years after the age of 18. Besides, the Agreement on Social Security signed between Canada and Cyprus in 1991 permits that those who have worked in Canada and have contributed to the Canada Pension Plan for a certain period of time might be qualified to enjoy the benefits of Cyprus pension system after verification. Even though the Cyprus pension programs have covered its population comparatively comprehensive, the replacement rate is still pretty low.

It was formed in 2004 by the consolidation of Gridley Community Unit School District 10 and El Paso Community Unit School District 375, after formation of a new unit district was put to the voters on the 2004 Illinois primary election ballot. History =District 375= El Paso The city of El Paso was originally all within one school district, but after the brick school was built on the east side of the city in 1869, upset people on the west side managed to split the district and form a second school district. The west side had a new, wooden school until Jefferson Park School was built on the same site in 1897. The east-side school was named McKinley School shortly after President William McKinley was assassinated in 1901. Both districts eventually had two-year high schools, and in 1892 both began four-year high school education. El Paso High School District 375 was formed in 1916 from the area of the east-side and west-side city districts and some rural areas, and originally continued holding classes in the east and west school buildings, but also held some classes in some downtown El Paso office buildings, until the El Paso High School building was finished in 1921. On May 22, 1944, the citizens voted to consolidate El Paso's east-side and west-side grade school districts. Panola Township By 1878, Panola Township had 10 school districts -- Panola, Hilsabeck, Shaw, Pauley, De Vries, McOmber, Hodgson, Bassett, Roth, and Punke -- with a total of 480 students. Nine of these districts survived all the way to the formation of the unit district in 1949. El Paso Community Unit School District 375 Unit School District 375 was organized on April 26, 1948. McKinley School on East Second Street was closed in 1948; it was sold in 1957, and demolished in May 1959. In addition, all the rural schoolhouses were closed in 1949, except for first through sixth grades at the Secor and Spring Hill schools. Centennial School was dedicated on September 13, 1956. Cooperative special education with other Woodford County schools and McLean County Unit District No. 5 began in 1969. Unit School District 375 closed the school in Secor at the end of the 1973‚Äì1974 school year, at which time it had 38 students, who afterwards went to Jefferson Park School and Centennial School.

(1559 or 1560 ‚Äì 27 April 1616) was a French architect, military and civil engineer, and topographical draughtsman, who served under Henry IV of France. His most notable work, Topographie fran√ßoise, published posthumously in 1641, is a collection of 500 views of French towns and buildings and constitutes a unique, if partial, historical account of French topography and architecture at the beginning of the 17th century.Boudon 1996.  Life and career  Chastillon was born in Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne. In the 1580s Chastillon became a part of the military retinue of Henry of Navarre (as Henry IV was known before he became king of France in 1589).Ballon 1991, p. 244. In 1591 Henry made Chastillon the Royal Topographer (Topographe du Roi), a post that at the time was otherwise unknown, and in 1595, a Royal Engineer (Ing√©nieur du Roi), a post established in the early 16th century which identified a member of a corps responsible for military fortifications, the mechanics of besiegement, and hydraulics. In the course of his professional duties, Chastillon toured France and neighboring countries and made drawings of many of the places he visited, including views of towns and buildings, ancient and contemporary. Many of these he began to have engraved. Among the engravers were Mathieu Merian, L√©onard Gaultier, Joachim Duviert, and Jacques Poinssart.Lemerle 2014a. In 1616 Chastillon died in Paris without having published the bulk of his collection of drawings.  Topographie fran√ßoise  Fifteen years after Chastillon's death, the publisher Jean Boisseau purchased the existing plates and drawings. He had Isaac Briot and Nicolas Briot, among others, engrave the drawings which had not yet been engraved and published the collection in 1641 as Topographie francoise ou representations de plusieurs villes, bourgs, chasteaux, maisons de plaisance, ruines & vestiges d‚Äôantiquit√© du royaume de France, crediting Chastillon as the creator of the drawings. Usually referred to simply as Topographie fran√ßoise, it provides a unique account of France at the beginning of the 17th century. It includes views of the houses and ch√¢teaux of officials and friends of the king, many now destroyed, and is therefore an invaluable source for the study of French noble residences of the period. Chastillon's depiction of the Cordouan lighthouse Errors were introduced in the second edition of 1648, when work of other artists was added. The second edition adds thirteen new plates, including several city plans, e.g., of Lunel, Montauban, and Montpellier, among others. Some of the plates had already appeared in copies published with a date on the title page of 1641, even though the plates themselves bear dates of 1642, 1643 and 1644. One of them is a unique view of the Cordouan lighthouse engraved by Jacques Poinssart.Lemerle 2014b. Chastillon had produced an expert evaluation for the completion of the lighthouse for Henry IV's minister, the Duke of Sully in 1606. Louis Boissevin (c. 1610‚Äì1685), a book publisher and print merchant, purchased Topographie fran√ßoise from Boisseau and published a third edition in 1655.Lemerle 2014. The plates were reordered alphabetically by name, but some of the views lacking titles were misidentified. The errors of the 1648 and 1655 editions and the tendency of the drawings to exaggerate the sizes of buildings, as well as the coarse quality of many of the engravings, have led some historians to discount the accuracy and utility of Topographie fran√ßoise. Unfortunately Chastillon's original drawings have been lost. Nevertheless, Fran√ßoise Boudon has argued that an examination of the work reveals that \\"Chastillon's topographical approach (his search for the best viewpoint, the measurement of distances, the pinpointing of characteristic features of the terrain and distinctive features of building etc)\\" ... has made it \\"apparent that these engravings, far from being whimsical and useless images, constitute the pages of a precise 'report' on France in the early 17th century.\\" The Topographie is a rare book with only about 15 extant copies, including all editions.

It is currently undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials. Desidustat is being developed for the treatment of anemia, where currently erythropoietin and its analogues are drugs of choice. Desidustat is a prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitor. In preclinical studies, effect of desidustat was assessed in normal and nephrectomized rats, and in chemotherapy-induced anemia. Desidustat demonstrated hematinic potential by combined effects on endogenous erythropoietin release and efficient iron utilization. Desidustat can also be useful in treatment of anemia of inflammation since it causes efficient erythropoiesis and hepcidin downregulation.. In January 2020, Zydus entered into licensing agreement with China Medical System Holdings for development and commercialization of Desidustat in Greater China. Under the license agreement, CMS will pay Zydus an initial upfront payment, regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalties on net sales of the product.

The oasis effect refers to the creation of a local microclimate that is cooler than the surrounding dry area due to evaporation or evapotranspiration of a water source or plant life and higher albedo of plant life than bare ground. The oasis effect is so-named because it occurs in desert oases. Urban planners can design a city's layout to optimize the oasis effect to combat the urban heat island effect. Since it depends on evaporation, the oasis effect differs by season.  Causes  An oasis contains moisture from a water source and/or plants. When that water evaporates or transpirates, heat from the surroundings is used to convert liquid to gas in an endothermic reaction, which results in cooler local temperatures. Moreover, vegetation has a higher albedo than bare ground, and reflects more sunlight, leading to lower land temperatures, lower air temperatures, and a cooler local microclimate.  Seasonal Effects  The oasis effect occurs most prominently during the summertime because warmer temperatures lead to more evaporation. In the winter, the oasis effect operates differently. Instead of making the oasis cooler, the oasis effect makes it warmer at night. This occurs through the fact that trees block heat from leaving the land. Basically, radiation cannot be emitted back into the atmosphere because the trees intercept and absorb it.  Urban Planning  Parks like Central Park in New York City help create an oasis effect in urban areas.The oasis effect plays a role in urban development because plants and bodies of water result in cooler cities. Accordingly, cities with parks will have lower temperatures because plants have higher albedo than bare ground or roads. Areas with higher albedo reflect more light than they absorb, leading to cooler temperatures. Normally, cities are hotter than their suburbs due to dense population, dark buildings and roads, and pollution; this is known as the urban heat island effect. However, by careful placement of trees, parks, and plant life, cities can create their own oasis effect. By maintaining plant life throughout a city, urban planners can produce an oasis effect to offer the urban heat island effect; even a small scattering of trees can significantly reduce local temperatures. However, concerns can arise in arid regions with limited water sources where city planners may not want to leave water sources out in the open to evaporate, and may not want to sacrifice water for upkeep of plants.

When the indicator is not bound, a narrow peak is observed at the detector. However, when the indicator is bound by the target analyte, the apparent size increases and a broader peak is observed. This change in size can be used for determine the analyte concentration and interaction  Published by The Royal Society of Chemistry. Flow-induced dispersion analysis (FIDA) is an immobilization-free technology used for characterization and quantification of biomolecular interaction and protein concentration under native conditions. In the FIDA assay, the size of a ligand (indicator) with affinity to the target analyte is measured. When the indicator interacts with the analyte the apparent size increases and this change in size can be used to determine the analyte concentration and interaction. Additionally, the hydrodynamic radius of the analyte-indicator complex is obtained. A FIDA assay is typically completed in minutes and only requires a modest sample consumption of a few ¬µl.  Applications  * Quantification of analytes (e.g. proteins, peptides, DNA, nanoparticles) in complex solutions (e.g. plasma and fermentation broth ) * Determination of  affinity constants  binding kinetics  molecular size (hydrodynamic radius)  diffusion coefficient  Principle  The FIDA principle is based on measuring the change in the apparent size (diffusivity) of a selective indicator interacting with the analyte molecule.
