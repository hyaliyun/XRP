History  In 1947, Mrs. Harry Turpin gifted a Stanzione original painting titled David With the Head of Goliath to the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego (now the San Diego Museum of Art); the work was then attributed to Ribera, but was reattributed to Stanzione by Mario Modestini in 1951, an attribution confirmed by Schleier, Felton, Zeri, and Spinosa. The painting is dated to approximately 1630. Caravaggio was an important influence in Stanzione‚Äôs artistic style and this painting illustrates a combination of styles from Caravaggio‚Äôs brutally realistic elements and dramatic lighting to classical 17th-century artistic trends including the lyrical style of Bologna artists. This painting shows David in an elegant posture, which softens the goriness, i.e. the dismembered head of Goliath. The theatrical lighting of this painting is a perfect demonstration of the chiaroscuro interpretation by Stanzione. Guido Reni and Caravaggio can be credited for Stanzione‚Äôs interpretation of chiaroscuro; they were supposedly his teachers. It was only after the painting was donated, that experts noticed under gallery lighting some aberrations in the canvas such as unevenness and crackle patterns. Those aberrations, along with the fact that young David appears to be gazing at something in the lower left corner led to suspicions that the canvas had been altered. By 1999, with the use of x-rays and careful removal of surface paint, the original paint of Goliath‚Äôs forehead was revealed. After intensive restoration, Goliath‚Äôs full face was uncovered and the painting restored to its original form. The full painting depicts Goliath‚Äôs dismembered head in the lower left corner, with David, knife in hand, gazing down to the lower left corner. It is believed that the head of Goliath was painted over in order to make the painting less gory and more appealing to potential buyers.

He is also the founder of Bomar Securities LP, which was sold to Instinet Corp. in 1992. He then went on to become Senior Vice President and Director at Instinet when owned by Reuters.com. Career Marc Chaikin began as a stock broker in 1965. He became head of the options department at Tucker Anthony & RL Day during the 1970s. Following his employment there, Chaikin bought a seat on the NYFE, where he traded futures contracts. In 1980 Chaikin began developing proprietary stock market indicators and in 1982 he joined the firm Drexel Burnham Lambert. That year he began hosting a regular segment on the Financial News Network‚Äîthe original incarnation of CNBC. It was from this point forward that he began to use early PCs to refine and execute his trading strategies based upon original economic indicators and computer algorithms. Later he would found the firm Bomar Securities LP, which sold to Instinet in 1992. Following the sale he would become a senior vice-president at the Instinet brokerage house. Chaikin spent much of his career developing computerized stock selection models for money managers. He is most known for his creation of the first real-time analytics workstation for portfolio managers and other stock traders, proprietary analytics that are currently a key part of the Thomson Reuters institutional workstation. He is especially recognized for his development of the Accumulation/Distribution Line indicator (ADL). Chaikin also developed the Chaikin Volume Accumulator (VAC) indicator. The two major indicators associated with the ADL are the Chaikin Oscillator and the Chaikin Money Flow indicators, both of which have been heavily used on Wall Street since their inceptions. Chaikin has asserted two of his philosophies as \\"I have always believed that earnings drive stock prices\\" and \\"I have a theory on Wall Street: bad things happen to companies that are over- valued, good things happen to companies that are fairly valued or cheap\\". In the late 2000s, Chaikin started the company Chaikin Stock Research, in order to provide professional grade stock tools to individual investors. As founder and CEO of the firm he has appeared on several national news networks including CNBC and Fox Business. In 2011 and 2012 he was noted in the media for his bullish optimism for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the stock market in general.

Contextualisation is then the process of identifying the data relevant to an entity based on the entity's contextual information.

It is also the name of the flagship technology which the organization developed. The organization's mission is to accelerate access to clean energy and water by matching partners with high impact solar tracking and water filtration technologies. SunSaluters optimizes the power output of solar photovoltaic panels using calibrated weight displacement (usually transfer of water from one container into another) to slowly rotate a solar panel to face the sun as it moves across the sky, substantially increasing the panel's power output. SunSaluter received a patent for the technology for integrating water filtration into the passive solar rotation design, although the design was open sourced in 2018, allowing anyone to build a SunSaluter. History The technology piloted by SunSaluter was invented by Eden Full Goh in 2008 and was initially under development by Full's company, Roseicollis Technologies, based in Canada. In 2011, Full Goh received a Thiel Fellowship for US$100,000 to develop her passive solar tracker concept, before continuing its development while an engineering student at Princeton University. SunSaluter was incorporated in 2013, and operates with a volunteer Board of Directors and small staff. By 2013, SunSaluter had pilot projects in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, and sales in Malawi, India, Indonesia, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. Technology SunSaluter's passive tracking system ensures the solar panel faces the sun throughout the day, without the use of electricity, permitting the panel to produce up to 30 to 40 percent more electricity than a fixed- mount panel. The process is also known as horizontal (azimuth) solar tracking. The slow flow of water through a filter into another container acts as a water clock roughly synchronized with the sun's motion. This also creates the opportunity to add a water filter onto the water clock, resulting in clean water at the end of each day. SunSaluter's integrated rotating axis and water filtration system is patented, though SunSaluter has encouraged partnerships to promote widest possible distribution of the technology. In 2018, SunSaluter announced that it would make the patented technology open-source, with the intent to \\"allow SunSaluter to impact not just thousands, but millions of people\\" and create opportunities for innovation on the design. Partners While maintaining lean operations, SunSaluter's funding sources are diverse including prize competitions, corporate sponsorship, charitable gifts, and board fundraising. Notable awards include: * The Thiel Foundation headed by Peter Thiel, which is funded Full Goh through the Thiel Fellowship. The fellowship totalled to $100,000 over two years. * Scotia Bank, which awarded $10,000 for creation of the SunSaluter as its Ecoliving 2011 Student Leader Award. * The Green Challenge, where the SunSaluter was the runner-up. * Ashoka Youth Competition, co-sponsored by the Staples Foundation. * Mashable's Startups for Good Challenge, winning $10,000, and a Social Good award from the UN Foundation.

Front view of an XM70E2 towed rocket launcher The XM70 has an unusual layout for a rocket launcher, borrowing most of its characteristics from towed howitzers. It used a closed breach and a hydraulic recoil mechanism rather than allowing rocket exhaust to exit the rear of the device, which allowed the crew to remain nearby to individually aim each rocket and to rapidly reload. It also had long trail arms and a base plate to pivot the system in common with conventional towed artillery. The rear view of the XM70E2 shows characteristics in common with towed howitzers The XM70 employed a unique revolver-like rotary magazine to fire rockets through a single launch tube in succession, rather than individual tubes for each rocket with the intent of improving accuracy while maintaining low overall weight and mobility.

The Kunlun () or Kunlun Shan is a mountain or mountain range in Chinese mythology, an important symbol representing the axis mundi and divinity. The mythological Kunlun is based on various sources, mythologic and geographic, the modernly so-called Kunlun Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and Mount Kailash (as an archetypal omphalos). The term \\"Kunlun\\" has also been applied to Southeastern Asian lands or islands and seemingly even Africa, although the relationship to the mountain is not clear, other than the nomenclature. In any case Kunlun refers to distant, exotic, and mysterious places. Different locations of Kunlun have been given in the various legends, myths, and semi-historical accounts in which it appears. These accounts typically describe Kunlun as the dwelling place of various gods and goddesses where fabled plants and mythical creatures may also be found. Many important events in Chinese mythology took place on Kunlun. Historical development As the mythology related to the Kunlun developed, it became influenced by the later introduction of ideas about an axis mundi from the cosmology of India. The Kunlun became identified with (or took on the attributes of) Mount Sumeru. Another historical development in the mythology of Kunlun (again with Indian influence) was that rather than just being the source of the Yellow River, Kunlun began to be considered to be the source of four major rivers flowing to the four quarters of the compass. The Kunlun mythos was also influenced by developments within the Taoist tradition and Kunlun came to be perceived more as a paradise than a dangerous wilderness. Some recent research proposed that over time, the merging of various traditions has result in a duality of paradises ‚Äì an East Paradise, identified with Mount Penglai, and a West Paradise, identified with Kunlun Mountain. A pole replaced a former mythic system which opposed Penglai with Guixu (\\"Returning Mountain\\") and the Guixu mythological material was transferred to the Kunlun mythos. Name The Chinese name \\"Kunlun\\" (or ) is written with characters combining the \\"mountain radical\\" Â±± with phonetics of kun and lun . Alternate names for Kunlun shan include Kunling (with \\"hill\\") and Kunqiu (with \\"mound\\"). The term \\"Kunlun\\" may be semantically related to two other terms: Hundun (), which is sometimes personified as a living creature; and kongdong (), according to Kristofer Schipper. Grotto-heavens were traditionally associated with mountains, as hollows or caves located in/on certain mountains. The term \\"Kunlun Mountain\\" can be translated as \\"Cavernous Mountain\\": and, the mythological Kunlun mountain has been viewed as a hollow mountain (located directly under the Pole star). The term \\"Kunlun\\" however had also been used in old texts to refer to people and places unrelated to the mythical mountain. It was, for example, used to transcribe the southern people called Gurong, who were slaves in China. Edward H. Schafer quotes the Old Book of Tang description. \\"They are also called Kurung. They are the barbarous men of the islands, great and small, of the Southern Seas. They are very black, and expose their naked Figures. They can tame and cow ferocious beasts, rhinoceroses, elephants, and the like.\\" Schafer notes that besides Kunlun, these southerners were occasionally written Gulong or Gulun . Julie Wilensky notes that the term Kunlun is a \\"mysterious and poorly understood word first applied to dark-skinned Chinese and then expanded over time to encompass multiple meanings, all connoting dark skin.\\" But then she goes on to say, \\"These uses of kunlun are unrelated to the name of the Kunlun Mountains.\\" And in a footnote to this, \\" Chang Hsing-Iang writes that the Kunlun mountain 'region has been familiar to the Chinese from the earliest times, and no Chinese work has ever described its inhabitants as being black- skinned.'\\" She then goes on to say how \\"Kunlun\\" was used to refer to places in Southeast Asia and Africa. Location Various ideas of the location of the mythical Kunlun Mountain have been given: chapter eleven of the Shanhaijing describes it as being in the northwest, chapter sixteen says it is south of the western sea, and other sources place it in the center of the earth. Some believed Kunlun to be located to the \\"far\\" west, in this case the alleged location was relocated further and further to the west, along with advances in geographical knowledge. E. T. C. Werner identifies Kunlun with the Hindu Kush mountain range. At times, the mythical Kunlun Mountain has been confused with the modern Kunlun Mountains and with Kurung (or Kurung Bnam, possibly meaning \\"Kings of the Mountain\\" in Old Khmer (formerly known as Old Cambodian), and equivalent to the Sanskrit ≈öailarƒÅja, also meaning \\"Kings of the Mountain\\", referring to a mythical holy cosmic mountain. Kurung (Kunlun) is known to have flourished during the time of the Tang dynasty, and seems to have developed ambassadorial relations with the Tang court, by the time of Li He (790‚Äì816), who records a visit in one of his extent poems: although geographical specifics of the state of Kunlun's location(s) remain uncertain, it is associated with trans-Gangetic India, possibly the Malay peninsula or areas controlled by the Sailendra thalassocracy. Description A throne and screen from the imperial workshops in the beginning of the era of the Kangxi Emperor (1662-1722). The screen depicts the Western Paradise, mythologically located on Kunlun Mountain, with scenes of mountains, valleys, seas, terraces, lakes, and palaces. Shown is the arrival of its ruler, the Queen Mother of the West (Xiwangmu), shown riding a phoenix, and the Eight Immortals awaiting her arrival. Kunlun Mountain has been described in various texts, as well as being depicted in art. Sometimes Kunlun appears as a pillar of the sky (or earth), sometimes appearing as being composed of multiple tiers, with the commonality of \\"mystery, grandeur, or magnificence\\" being emphasized in the mythological descriptions. The base of the Kunlun Mountain is said to penetrate as far into the earth, as its above-ground part proceeds towards the sky. Generally, accounts emphasize the difficulty of access to the mountain and even more to its more hallowed places, due to surrounding waters and steep cliffs of immense heights. Kunlun typically also has a strong association with various means to obtain immortality, or longevity. Poetic descriptions tend to lavish Kunlun with paradisaical detail: gem-like rocks and towering cliffs of jasper and jade, exotic jeweled plants, bizarrely formed and colored magical fungi, and numerous birds and other animals, together with humans who have become immortal beings. Sometimes it is the Eight Immortals who are seen, coming to pay their respects to the goddess Xiwangmu, perhaps invited to join her in a feast of immortal repast. This is the well-worn image or motif that is frequently painted, carved, or otherwise depicted in the material arts. Association with divinitySupreme Deity= Kunlun is believed to be the representation of the Supreme Deity (Taidi). According to some sources, his throne is at the top tier of the mountain and known as the \\"Palace of Heaven\\". As Kunlun was sometimes viewed as the pillar holding up the sky and keeping it separated from the earth, some accounts place the top of Kunlun in Heaven rather than locating it as part of the earth: in this case the Supreme Deity's abode on Kunlun is actually in Heaven, and Kunlun functions as a sort of ladder which could be used to travel between earth and Heaven. Accordingly, any person who succeeded in climbing up to the top of Kunlun would magically become an immortal spirit. =Xiwangmu= Peach Festival of the Queen Mother of the West, a Chinese Ming Dynasty painting from the early 17th century, by an anonymous artist. A mythological event traditionally occurring on the mythological Kunlun Mountain. From the Freer and Sackler Galleries of Washington D.C. Emperor Wudi of the Han dynasty meeting Xiwangmu, according to a fictional account of his magical transportation to Kunlun Mountain. Although not originally located on Kunlun, but rather on a Jade Mountain neighboring to the north (and west of the Moving Sands), Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of Meng Hao in the West, in later accounts was relocated to a palace protected by golden ramparts, within which immortals (xian) feasted on bear paws, monkey lips, and the livers of dragons, served at the edge of the Lake of Gems. Every 6000 years the peaches which conferred immortality upon those who ate them would be served (except the time when they were purloined by Monkey King). Originally a plague deity with tiger teeth and leopard tail, she became a beautiful and well-mannered goddess responsible for guarding the herb of immortality. =Yu Shi= Yu Shi, a Chinese spirit or god of rain, also known as the \\"Lord of Rain\\" or \\"Leader of Rain\\" is thought to have his dwelling place upon the Kunlun slopes. During the reign of Shennong, a certain Chisongzi (Master Red Pine) performed a rain-making ceremony which successfully ended a terrible drought, leading to his promotion to \\"Yu Shi\\", \\"Master of Rain\\". =Shamans= According to the Shanhaijing, the top of Kunlun is the habitation of shamans, depicting Wu Peng holding the herb of immortality there, in the company of five other shamans called Siva Harish. =Xian= In later tradition Kunlun was pictured as a Daoist paradise, inhabited by xian, or Daoist immortals (humans who had metamorphosed into superhuman form), which was presided over by Xiwangmu. The xian were often seen as temporary residents, who visited by means of flying on the back of a magical crane or dragon. Creatures Chiang Tz≈≠-ya at K‚Äôun-lun Kunlun has a lively bestiary, with various more-or-less fantastic beasts and birds described as present in its environs. Often the tiger or beings with tiger- like features are associated with Kunlun, since the tiger is symbolic of the west, as Kunlun is often associated with the Western Paradise. Creatures symbolic of immortality are often seen or described in depictions of Kunlun, such as deer or cranes. Xiwangmu is often identified as having a spotted deer as a pet. Besides the cranes (traditionally thought of as the mounts or the transformations of immortals), other birds come and go from the mountain, flying errands for Xiwangmu: these blue (or green) birds are her qingniao. Sometimes the poets claim to have received a happy inspiration during a visit by one of these birds, carrying a message from Xiwangmu. Plants The flora of Kunlun and its environs is in keeping with the rest of its natural (and supernatural qualities), and includes the Pearl and Jade Trees, the Tree of Immortality, and Tree Grain, the last of which (Muhe) was forty feet in height and five spans in thickness. Peaches are (and have been) often associated with Xiwangmu The langgan was a tree of fairy gems in colours of blue or green, which was reported to grow on Kunlun in the classic books of the Zhou and early Han dynasties. Palaces and Gardens Kunlun is described as having various structures, areas, or significant features either on or around the area of the mountain. The palace of Xiwangmu, sometimes described as having golden ramparts, was located on Kunlun: those blessed to gather there might partake of the fruit of longevity. Often her palace is described as having a park or garden, bordering a Jasper Pool. Of gardens, a (the) Hanging Garden was referenced early on. Rivers and Sands Four rivers were sometimes said to flow out of Kunlun Mountain: the Red River (Chishui, ), the Yellow River, the Black River (, black water), and the Yang River (Yang 2005: 161). A fifth river was said to flow around the base of Kunlun, which rose in a way which was particularly steep and hard to climb. This Weak River at the base of Kunlun flowed with a liquid so lacking in density that not even a feather could float upon it. This was a major obstacle, since it could neither be swum or floated over on a vessel (Yang 2005: 162, 219). However, this was an obstacle routinely overcome by those practiced in the way of magic (Daoist or shamanic). Two examples of those who overcame were Sun Wukong (Journey to the West) or Qu Yuan in his poem (\\"Li Sao\\"), both already on the path to immortality, one as a god and the other as a poet. Another barrier to Kunlun were the dangerous and difficult-to-cross Moving Sands, also known as Flowing Sands or Liusha. According to Shanhaijing (Chapter 16), Kunlun was located south of the West Sea, behind the Red River, and on the shore of Liusha (Yang 2005: 162, 219). Events Kunlun Mountain is a major scene of action in various myths, as well as literary works derived from the myths, legends, or religious descriptions or depictions. Marriage of N√ºwa and Fuxi Fuxi and Nuwa's marriage took place on the mountain of Kunlun. Generally held to be brother and sister, and the last surviving human beings after a catastrophic flood, the incest taboo was waived by an explicit sign after prayerful questioning of a divine being who approved their marriage and thus the repopulation of the world. Mu, Son of Heaven Mu son of Heaven is one visitor, carried along on his trip by eight extraordinary mounts, depicted in art as \\"weird and unworldly\\". Cultural references Many important literary references and allusions to Kunlun Mountain are found in traditional works, including famous novels, poems, and theatrical pieces. It also appears in modern popular fictions. Novels Among other literature, Kunlun Mountain appears in Fengshen Yanyi, Legend of the White Snake, the Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven, Kunlun Nu, Zhen Hun (also known as Guardian) and Journey to the West (also known as Monkey). Theater The Kunlun Slave (slave from Kunlun) was a stock character in Chinese theater, and known in Japanese theater \\"Konron\\". He was portrayed as exotic in appearance, and possessed of superhuman powers. The Ming dynasty dramatist and playwright Mei Dingzuo (1549-1615) wrote a play \\"How the Kunlun Slave Became an Immortal\\". Poetry Kunlun Mountain is a subject of poetic allusion from the ancient poems \\"Li Sao\\" and \\"Heavenly Questions\\" by Qu Yuan, through frequent mentions in the medieval Tang dynasty poetry, and, in the twentieth century in Mao Zedong's 1935 poem \\"Kunlun\\". Modern popular culture Kunlun is used in the manga 3√ó3 Eyes. The term, written as K'un-Lun, is also used in the story of the Iron Fist in Marvel Comics as one of the seven Capital Cities of Heaven in the Marvel Universe that only appears on Earth periodically. In Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier (2007), K'un-Lun is identified with the Fire Mountain from H. Rider Haggard's Ayesha. Kunlun is also featured in many Chinese Dramas.

Their musical style has been mainly described as EDM, dance-rock, and dance-pop. However, Krewella's style has been influenced by a number of electronic sub genres, including progressive house, electro, dubstep, drum and bass, trap music and future bass. Their debut EP, Play Hard, was released on June 18, 2012, exclusively on Beatport, followed by its release on other digital platforms on June 26, 2012. Later, their debut album, Get Wet, was released on September 24, 2013, on iTunes. The band consists of sisters Jahan Yousaf and Yasmine Yousaf. Originally a trio, their third member and producer Kristopher Trindl left the band in 2014. The band's name stems from Jahan's misspelling of the word \\"cruel\\" when the two began writing music, and is not a reference to Cruella de Vil.  History = 2007‚Äì2013: Formation and career beginnings  Krewella formed in 2007 and consisted of sisters Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf, whose father is of Pakistani descent, along with producer Kris Trindl. The three met as students at Glenbrook North High School. Their music is a blend of self-produced electro house and dubstep, with influences of many other EDM styles. All three members of the band have \\"6-8-10\\" tattoos to commemorate June 8, 2010, the day when the three agreed to give up their careers, schooling, and any other intentions for their lives, to dedicate all of their time to the band's joint music career. In December 2011 Monstercat signed Krewella; \\"Killin' It\\" was Krewella's first original song released by a label. Monstercat promoted Krewella with social media campaigns and partnered with EDM YouTube promotional channels for a larger platform. In June 2012, Krewella released their EP Play Hard. The second single, \\"Alive\\" peaked at number one on the US Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart and it also placed on the US Billboard Hot 100. Krewella has headlined at EDM festivals around the globe including Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, Stereosonic, Spring Awakening, Sunburn Festival and Paradiso festival. These live performances earned them the 2012 International Dance Music Award for \\"Best Breakthrough Artist.\\" After their performance at Ultra Music Festival 2013, Billboard declared that \\"Krewella is going to be huge!\\" Their debut album Get Wet charted in the Top 10 of the US Billboard 200 in its first week. Krewella teamed up with producer group Cash Cash to make their second single \\"Live For The Night\\".  2014‚Äì2015: Lawsuit, Trindl's departure and Somewhere to Run  In January 2014, Krewella partnered with EDM lifestyle brand Electric Family to produce a collaboration bracelet for which 100% of the proceeds are donated to Dance For Paralysis. The partnership has raised over $17,000 as of April 2014. In September 2014, it was announced that Trindl is no longer part of Krewella. Trindl subsequently filed a lawsuit against the sisters for $5 million, claiming that he was unfairly \\"thrown out\\" of the band. The Yousaf sisters countersued, claiming Trindl had drug and alcohol problems, \\"pretended to DJ\\" onstage, and ultimately resigned from the band. On November 24, 2014, Krewella released their first single following Trindl's departure titled \\"Say Goodbye\\". The track reflects on the loss of a member and the lawsuit against the Yousaf sisters. On March 23, 2015, Krewella released \\"Somewhere to Run\\" produced by Pegboard Nerds and others. In June 2015, Krewella's \\"Somewhere to Run\\" was featured in the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority's \\"Krewellavator\\" marketing campaign. The spot was filmed in an actual elevator at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. Krewella released Troll mix Vol. 14 - Return of the Trolls on August 15, 2015, its title a reference to the time gap following the previous one. This mix is the first released after Trindl's departure. The hour long mix features a new track from the sisters, named \\"Surrender the Throne\\". It also includes a new remix of their single \\"Somewhere to Run\\". The sisters were featured on the single \\"Love Song to the Earth\\" alongside; Paul McCartney, Jon Bon Jovi, Sheryl Crow, Fergie, Colbie Caillat, Natasha Bedingfield, Leona Lewis, Sean Paul, Johnny Rzeznik, Ang√©lique Kidjo, Kelsea Ballerini, Nicole Scherzinger, Christina Grimmie, Victoria Justice and Q'orianka Kilcher. In August 2015, it was announced that Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf had settled the lawsuit with Kris Trindl out-of-court. The terms of the settlement were not made public.  2016: Ammunition  Krewella announced in 2015, that they had been working on a new extended play, intended to be completed in time for a 2016 tour. From that time out prior to the release there were many snippets of upcoming music including the songs \\"Broken Record\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"Beggars\\" (with Diskord), \\"Louder Than Bombs\\", \\"Friends\\", \\"Superstar\\" (with Pegboard Nerds and NGHTMRE) and \\"Marchin On\\". The single \\"Beggars\\" (With Diskord) was released on April 29, 2016. Krewella have stated that \\"Broken Record\\" will be released a week before Ammunition. Krewella were set to present at the inaugural Electronic Music Awards which were supposed to be held on April 23, 2016, but were postponed to later in the year. On April 29, 2016, Krewella released a 30-second video of Yasmine rapping to the tune of Kanye West's song \\"I Love Kanye\\" stating \\"F**k it, tomorrow we gon' give you all some new Krewella\\" prior to the release of the single \\"Beggars\\" with Diskord. The music video for the song was released at the same time. On May 4, 2016, a video titled \\"Love, Yazzy\\" was released to the public of Yasmine speaking of her memories of Krewella since her beginnings with the band. The end of the video stated the release date of Ammunition which was May 20, 2016. Two days after this, a video titled \\"Love, Jahan\\" which talked about unity and a \\"krew without borders\\" before announcing a new, smaller more intimate SWEATBOX Tour. This headlining Fall tour spanned across 16 dates in North America and Canada and featured brand new music and their entire live band. On May 10, 2016, the promotional single \\"Broken Record\\" was released. On the last few days before the release, teasers for \\"Surrender the Throne\\", \\"Marching On\\", \\"Beggars\\", \\"Broken Record\\", \\"Ammunition\\", and \\"Can't Forget You\\" were released, with the latter being released one day before Ammunition's release. On May 27, 2016, Krewella was featured on a single by Pegboard Nerds and NGHTMRE titled \\"Superstar\\" that did not make the final cut for the Ammunition EP. 2017‚Äìpresent: New World and Zer0 In an interview with Gary Vee, the sisters stated that they were currently in the studio working on a follow up to Ammunition. They have since played more teasers, such as \\"Angels Cry\\", \\"dead af\\", \\"Team\\", and \\"Rise Up\\". \\"Team\\" was later released. Krewella hinted at two new songs on their Snapchat while performing in Sydney for New Year's Eve. One of them is called \\"Be There\\". More teasers have been played since then, in fact there are almost 11 unreleased songs altogether. \\"Be There\\" was due to be released by the end of March, finally releasing on May 10, 2017. They also confirmed their own record label, named Mixed Kids Records, with \\"Be There\\" becoming their first release on it. In 2017, Krewella partnered with dance-fitness program Zumba. They made a song called \\"I Got This\\" for their new STRONG program, which entails of workouts to high energy music. This has yet to be released, but it was teased on the STRONG Instagram page. On May 17, they played at a Zumba 'fitness concert' where they played a set while instructors and attendees performed a dance workout. Here, they teased a song called \\"Thrilla\\", which following the release of another single on May 31, 2017, a song called \\"Love Outta Me\\". They released the first part of their two part EP New World on June 8, 2017. They later announced their New World Tour with a video from Aladdin with Yasmine's face over Yasmine and Jahan's face appearing on random characters throughout. Krewella estimated that New World Part 2 would be released by mid-2017, then later by early September 2017 and before their New World Tour, but neither of these release dates eventuated. Multiple teasers of possible songs exist, such as \\"dead af\\", \\"Rise Up\\", \\"New World\\" (with Yellow Claw), \\"Angels Cry\\", \\"I Got This\\", \\"Thrilla\\", \\"Alibi\\", \\"Like We\\", and multiple unnamed songs. They released a new single, \\"New World\\", on September 18, 2017, featuring Yellow Claw and Taylor Bennett. \\"Dead AF\\" was later released as a single on October 24, 2017. On October 31, Krewella went on livestream from their tour bus on EDM social app 'WAV'. They mentioned that New World Part 2 should be released in 2018. They also teased five unreleased songs: \\"Run Away\\", \\"Bad Liar\\", \\"Alarm\\" (with Lookas), \\"Ain't That Why\\" (with R3HAB), \\"Another Round\\" (with Pegboard Nerds) and \\"Angels Cry\\". \\"Another Round\\" with Pegboard Nerds was released on November 17, \\"Alarm\\" with Lookas was released on December 1, and \\"Ain't That Why\\" with R3HAB was released on December 8. \\"Angels Cry\\" followed on December 29, 2017, released through their fan phone line‚Äîanyone who texted the line previously received a text with a link, and anyone else can text \\"angel tears\\" to the number to receive it. Krewella mentioned a version of \\"New World\\" (with Yellow Claw) featuring Chinese rapper VAVA. While Krewella were in China, they posted on social media with VAVA, appeared at one of her concerts in Beijing, and also filmed a music video for this version. It was released in January 2018. As of July 2018, they are featured in Coke Studio (Pakistan) Season 11 as featured artists and were also part of the well-received Season promo song \\"Hum Dekhenge\\" which was rendition of Poem written by Faiz Ahmad Faiz. Their featured Coke Studio debut song \\"Runaway\\" was an instant hit in Pakistan. The song also was a reconnect with their Pakistani roots. Paired with the raw power of Riaz Qadri and Ghulam Ali Qadri‚Äôs folk vocals, the bank brought their first fusion track about hijr (separation from a beloved). Primarily an English song, Jahan and Yasmine also sing in one of their native languages for the first time. The vocal harmonies combined with a driving dholak groove and soulful sarangi is what makes \\"Runaway\\" a tasteful juxtaposition. As of January 2020, the duo released a new track called \\"Greenlights\\", that has gained around 1.2 million views since this entry and would give Krewella their second number one on Billboard‚Äôs Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart in April 2020.

Their music is often described as down-tempo, doom/death-inspired melancholia with angelic female vocals.  History  Trees of Eternity was formed when guitarist Juha Raivio and singer Aleah got together in the studio to work on the song \\"Lights on the Lake\\" for the upcoming Swallow the Sun album New Moon. The plan was to feature Aleah's vocals on part of the song already prepared by Juha, but when they instead began to experiment with a vocal line Aleah had written for the occasion the session quickly headed off in a new direction and the project took on a life of its own. The pair released a four-song promo online, and have since completed and recorded the songs for their upcoming debut album. Trees of Eternity also signed a publishing deal with UK-based AMF Publishing. The full album line-up of Trees of Eternity includes, apart from the two original members, Fredrik Norrman (October Tide, ex-Katatonia), Mattias Norrman (October Tide, ex-Katatonia) and Kai Hahto (Wintersun, Swallow the Sun, Nightwish), as well as some acclaimed guest musicians. On April 18, 2016, singer Aleah Stanbridge died from cancer at age 39. Two days later, Juha wrote on Facebook that the album has been ready to be released for a while and that the plans are still in motion. He was also planning to release Aleah's solo songs. On August 11, 2016, the band's debut album, Hour of the Nightingale, was announced to be released on November 11.

He was admitted at Queens' College, Cambridge on 1 July 1592 and was admitted at Inner Temple in 1594. He was knighted on 11 May 1603. In 1615 he was Sheriff of Norfolk.

Kevin Masters Show starring Tom Rhodes was hosted by comedian Tom Rhodes and featured rapper E-Life as the musical sidekick. Background Rhodes started performing in the Netherlands at Toomlers once a year, beginning in 1998. The RTL network contacted Rhodes London management after seeing him perform in 2002. The producers wanted an American host to interview Dutch celebrities and interpret Dutch culture. The name \\"Kevin Masters\\" was simply a generic American name the producers used to fill in until they assigned an actual host. The audition for a host was held at Toomlers, (Yiddish word for \\"Traveling Merrimaker\\") the home theatre of Comedytrain, the first stand-up comedy collective in the Netherlands. The actual show was filmed at Rozen Theater in Amsterdam. He was living in Amsterdam with a girlfriend at the time of auditioning for the show. Tom's audition for the show featured his normal stand-up routine and was selected as the best by producers. In addition to Dutch celebrities, Tom also interviewed American celebrities. The charm of the show was that the American host had no idea who these Dutch celebrities were, which added to the humor Rhodes could play upon with each guest. As a stand-up transitioning to talk show host, Rhodes had to learn to ignore the audience and speak to the people at home through the camera lens. To help him with this task, the Dutch producers allowed him to tape a cut out of Muhammad Ali's head over Camera One. The cut-out remained for the entire first season. In every episode, Rhodes would experience an aspect of Dutch culture in a five-minute film. He called this his favorite part of the show. Some of these experiences included: spending a day with a Dutch farmer, covering the Prime Minister debates, a tour of the Red Light district and gay night life of Amsterdam, attending fashion and master chef awards. Anything culturally unique in Amsterdam was explained to Rhodes by experts, which Rhodes called \\"like having a magic passport to the entire country.\\" There is no censorship on Dutch television, unlike in the United States, so Rhodes and his guests were able to swear, show nudity, and even smoke cannabis. Steve-O from Jackass recreated his famous \\"nut-staple\\" trick on the program in 2003. Having experienced television in both American and the Netherlands, Rhodes says the Netherlands were much more auspicious. \\"The difference between making TV in the US versus the Netherlands is that in the US when quitting time comes everyone runs for the exits and can't get away from their co-workers fast enough. In the Netherlands it is traditional that at the end of the day people go for a drink or a meal and continue talking about the project that you are working on to make it better,\\" said Rhodes. In an interview about the show, Rhodes stated he wished the show would run for 5‚Äì10 years, giving him enough time to learn Dutch. The show ran for three full seasons. It was a concept created by Amsterdam's Blammo Television and was produced by Holland Media House, now Blue Circle. Rhodes became very popular in the Netherlands and was the equivalent to David Letterman in the Dutch talk show world. When the show came to an end, the network asked Tom to be a presenter on Yorin Travel, now known as RTL Travel.

In a judgment issued on 24 March 2016 in the separate trial of Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, the ICTY said there was insufficient evidence in that case that Milo≈°eviƒá had supported plans to expel non-Serbs from Serb-held territory in Bosnia during the 1992-95 war. Background Milo≈°eviƒá was indicted in May 1999, during the Kosovo War, by the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for crimes against humanity in Kosovo. Charges of violating the laws or customs of war, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions in Croatia and Bosnia and genocide in Bosnia were added a year and a half later. The charges on which Milo≈°eviƒá was indicted were: genocide; complicity in genocide; deportation; murder; persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds; inhumane acts/forcible transfer; extermination; imprisonment; torture; willful killing; unlawful confinement; willfully causing great suffering; unlawful deportation or transfer; extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; cruel treatment; plunder of public or private property; attacks on civilians; destruction or willful damage done to historic monuments and institutions dedicated to education or religion; unlawful attacks on civilian objects.http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/cis/en/cis_milosevic_slobodan_en.pdf The trial=Duration of trial  Following Milo≈°eviƒá's transfer, the original charges of war crimes in Kosovo were upgraded by adding charges of genocide in Bosnia and war crimes in Croatia. On 30 January 2002, Milo≈°eviƒá accused the war crimes tribunal of an \\"evil and hostile attack\\" against him. The trial began at The Hague on 12 February 2002, with Milo≈°eviƒá defending himself. Rade Markoviƒá stated that a written statement he had made implicating Milo≈°eviƒá had been extracted from him by ill-treatment legally amounting to torture by named NATO officers Judge May declared this to be \\"irrelevant\\", but Milo≈°eviƒá stated that it was forbidden under the 1988 rules concerning evidence gained by torture. The prosecution took two years to present its case in the first part of the trial, where they covered the wars in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo. Throughout the two-year period, the trial was being closely followed by the public of the involved former Yugoslav republics as it covered various notable events from the war and included several high-profile witnesses. Milo≈°eviƒá, while defending himself, read from Friedrich Naumann's book Mitteleuropa, claiming it was a long-standing objective of German foreign policy and the German liberal party in particular to \\"erase Serbia from the map\\", citing a number of alleged wrongdoings by Germany against Serbia during the last hundred years, including the recognition of Croatia and other countries. He pointed out that Klaus Kinkel, the German Foreign Minister who proposed the creation of the tribunal, was a German liberal. During the prosecution case, 295 witnesses testified and 5,000 exhibits were presented to the court recording a mass of evidence. After the presentation of the prosecution case, the Trial Chamber, on 16 June 2004, rejected a defense motion to dismiss the charges for lack of evidence and ruled in accordance with Rule 98bis, that the prosecution case contains evidence capable of supporting a conviction on all 66 counts. The Defense was given the same amount of time as the prosecution to present its case. There were in total 466 hearing days, four hours per day. 40 hours were left in the Defense case, and the trial was on schedule to end by the end of the spring. The prosecution was directed by the trial chamber to conclude its Kosovo case during four and a half to five months time span to make way for the presentation in September 2002 of the Bosnia and Croatia cases, followed by a defense case if Milo≈°eviƒá wanted to do so. Initially the length of the trial was presumed to go for two years and instead lasted four that contained multiple adjournments which ended with Milo≈°eviƒá's death prior to his defense case being completed.  Kosovo Conflict case  Milo≈°eviƒá was indicted for crimes during the Kosovo war, charged with violating international humanitarian law on five counts during 1 January-20 June 1999. The first charge was Deportation (a crime against humanity). The prosecution stated in their case against Milo≈°eviƒá that he was part of a criminal enterprise and involved in orchestrating a campaign of violence and terror to force a sizable part of the Kosovo Albanian population to leave and maintain Serb control over Kosovo. The second charge was Other inhumane Acts - Forcible transfer (a crime against humanity), which is similar to the charge of deportation though additionally implying use of force encompassing internal displacement. The third and forth charge entailed Murder (combined in this instance as a crime against humanity and violating the customs and laws of war). Six hundred Kosovars were identified in the indictment as being killed in sixteen individual incidents during mass expulsion. In addition based upon the exhumations of mass graves and the number of missing persons, human rights organisations estimated around ten thousand Kosovars being killed during hostilities, with KLA combatants only forming a small minority of the deceased. Also counted were unarmed combatants killed in violation of the ICTY statute and Geneva Conventions. The fifth charge was Persecutions (a crime against humanity). The indictment referred to Milo≈°eviƒá using mass forced population deportation and transfer, sexual assault, murder, along with damage or destruction of Kosovo Albanian religious sites \\"to execute a campaign of persecution against the Kosovo Albanian based on political, racial or religious grounds\\". The ICTY indictment against Milo≈°eviƒá referred to methods of persecution done against Kosovo Albanians to \\"wreak systematic and wanton destruction and damage to their religious sites and cultural monuments\\". The prosecution in the trial sought to prove Milo≈°eviƒá guilty of those actions and events.. \\"One of the methods used to persecute the Kosovar population was to wreak systematic and wanton destruction and damage to their religious sites and cultural monuments, according to the indictment. Such destruction committed on political, racial, or religious grounds is a crime against humanity. Through the testimony of Andras Riedlmayer, an international expert on the Balkan cultural heritage of the Ottoman era, the prosecution sought to prove Milosevic guilty of it.\\" In his defense, Milo≈°eviƒá asserted that Kosovo Albanian heritage sites, in addition to Serb Orthodox historical and religious monuments were damaged by NATO bombing. Yugoslav Serb authorities in several cases alleged that NATO destroyed monuments, however the investigative team led by Andr√°s Riedlmayer found them intact like two Ottoman bridges and the Sinan Pasha Mosque. Investigators absolved NATO of responsibility except for damage to a village mosque roof and a disused Catholic church damaged through an air blast after an nearby army base was struck by a missile. Riedlmayer's report to the Milo≈°eviƒá trial concluded that kulla dwellings and a third of mosques were subjected to damage and destruction, with three Ottoman period urban centres being devastated due to intentionally lit fires. The report also noted that the Yugoslav Serb army, paramilitary and police forces and in some instances Serb civilians did those attacks, according to eyewitness accounts. Riedlmayer found out that Yugoslav Serb forces used as bases of operation two Catholic churches which in international law was prohibited. The investigative team noted that destruction and damage of Kosovo Albanian heritage sites were done during the 1999 war through ground attack and not air strikes. \\"Riedlmayer, associated with Harvard University, provided a report of his investigations of war damage to cultural and religious sites in Kosova. Based on a two-year study that he undertook with the architect and Balkan specialist Andrew Herscher between July 1999 and the summer of 2001, sponsored by Harvard‚Äôs Center for Middle Eastern Studies, the report concluded that three out of four urban centers dating to the Ottoman years were devastated as a result of intentionally set fires. Serbian police, army troops, paramilitaries, and in some cases Serb civilians perpetrated these attacks, according to eyewitnesses. In addition, traditional Albanian residential buildings, called kullas, were targeted for destruction. Over one-third of all mosques in Kosova were damaged or destroyed. While Milosevic asserted that NATO bombardment was responsible for damage to Kosova Albanian heritage sites as well as for damage and destruction to Serbian Orthodox religious and historical monuments, Riedlmayer‚Äôs study absolved NATO of responsibility for all but damage to the roof of one village mosque and to a disused Catholic church, damaged by an air blast during a missile strike on a nearby army base. In several cases where Serb authorities alleged complete destruction of monuments by NATO (such as the Sinan Pasha Mosque and two Ottoman bridges), investigators found the monuments completely intact. Riedlmayer described how investigators reached their conclusions that damage was not caused by air strikes.... Throughout the province, Riedlmayer and his co-investigators found damage and destruction of Kosova Albanian cultural heritage sites from ground attack during the war and what appeared to be Kosovar attacks against Serbian cultural heritage sites after the war. He also learned that Serbian forces used two Catholic churches as bases of operation, which was prohibited by international law. Riedlmayer later testified to similar destruction of Islamic religious and cultural sites during the Bosnian war.\\" Charges relating to crimes against humanity, the prosecution had to prove that armed conflict occurred, systematic and widespread attack existed, the conduct of Milo≈°eviƒá was related to systematic and widespread attack upon a civilian population and that he was aware of the wider situation where his conduct happened. The prosecution also had to prove that Milo≈°eviƒá had the necessary state of mind for crimes that were wilful, intentional or having a disregard of consequences for human life by actions committed by himself or his subordinates. Apart from the need to prove intent for committing the crime of persecution, the prosecution had to demonstrate that those actions were undertaken with intent toward discriminating on religious, political and racial grounds. Within the context of Milo≈°eviƒá as an individual, charges against him related to individual and command responsibility. In the case against Milo≈°eviƒá, he was accused of ordering, planning, instigating alongside aiding and abetting toward planning, preparing and executing crimes, with the act of committing being in reference to participating in a criminal enterprise and not being physically responsible for crimes. Milo≈°eviƒá was also charged by the prosecutor for failure of his command responsibility and responsibility as a superior for acts done by subordinates where a superior was aware or knew that a subordinate was on the verge of violating international humanitarian law or committing war crimes; and that a superior failed to undertake measures to stop actions or punish perpetrators. Command responsibility was held by Milo≈°eviƒá the prosecution alleged due to his position along with control and power, having no regard toward his position or both. Death of Milo≈°eviƒá Milo≈°eviƒá was found dead in his cell on 11 March 2006, in the UN war crimes tribunal's detention center, located in the Scheveningen section of The Hague, Netherlands. Autopsies soon established that Milo≈°eviƒá had died of a heart attack. He had been suffering from heart problems and high blood pressure. Many suspicions were voiced to the effect that the heart attack had been caused or made possible deliberately ‚Äì by the ICTY, according to sympathizers, or by himself, according to critics. Milo≈°eviƒá death occurred shortly after the Tribunal denied his request to seek specialized medical treatment at a cardiology clinic in Russia.\\"Report to the President Death of Slobodan Milosevic\\". ICTY, May 2006. Pg. 4 para. 3Decision on Assigned Counsel Request for Provisional Release. ICTY, 23 February 2006. ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte delivered her public statement following Milo≈°eviƒá's death: Due to Milo≈°eviƒá's death during the trial, the court returned no verdict on the charges. On 24 March 2016, the ICTY issued its judgement in the separate case against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, in which it concluded that insufficient evidence had been presented in that case to find that Slobodan Milosevic \\"agreed with the common plan\\" to create territories ethnically cleansed of non-Serbs during the Bosnian War of 1992 to 1995. The judgement noted \\"Milo≈°eviƒá's repeated criticism and disapproval of the policies and decisions made by [Karad≈æiƒá] and the Bosnian Serb leadership\\" and, in a footnote, the \\"apparent discord between [Karad≈æiƒá] and Milo≈°eviƒá\\" during which Milo≈°eviƒá \\"openly criticised Bosnian Serb leaders of committing 'crimes against humanity' and 'ethnic cleansing' and the war for their own purposes.\\" Nevertheless, the court also noted that \\"Milo≈°eviƒá provided assistance in the form of personnel, provisions, and arms to the Bosnian Serbs during the conflict\\".

Wilhelm then spent two years out of baseball from 1951 to 1952, when he served in the United States Army in the Korean War. In 1953, Wilhelm returned from military service and had his most successful minor league season. In 96 games with the Paducah Chiefs of the Class D Kentucky‚ÄìIllinois‚ÄìTennessee League, he batted .291 and hit 14 home runs. After the 1954 season, which he split between the Columbus Cardinals and the Allentown Cardinals, Wilhelm left the Cardinals organization. Wilhelm played the 1955 and 1956 seasons in the Milwaukee Braves system, advancing as high as the Double-A Atlanta Crackers. He played his final season of professional baseball in summer 1957, with the Greensboro Patriots of the Boston Red Sox organization. He appeared in a total of 401 minor league games, hitting .212 with 21 home runs. Coaching career Prior to his final season of professional baseball in summer 1957, Wilhelm had served as an assistant baseball coach for the North Carolina Tar Heels in spring 1957. In September 1957, Wilhelm accepted the head coaching position at Clemson. In his first two seasons, Wilhelm led the program to two Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championships and its first two College World Series appearances, in 1958 and 1959. In the next 13 season (1960‚Äì1972), however, Clemson made only one NCAA Tournament appearance, in 1967.

It is situated in Dbayyeh, in the Metn district. It is considered one of the best Armenian schools in the vast Armenian Diaspora, and also in Lebanon thanks to its high success rates in the Lebanese Brevet and Baccalaureate exams.Armenian newspaper Aztag (rewarded as the best armenian newspaper in the diaspora) announcing the 96% success in the Lebanese Baccalaureates of Yeghishe Manoukian students  History  Yeghishe Manoukian College was founded in 1963 under the name of Mardikian Kindergarten-Elementary School. The founder of the school is believed to be Catholicos Sahag A. Khabian in the 1930s. Initially the school was located next to the Armenian Catholicosate of the Great Home of Cilicia, and was called Mesrobian School. *In 1963, Nerces Pakhdikian was assigned director. In 1966, Archbishop Mesrob Ashjian was named director of the school, who at the same time was also the director of the seminary. He had Oshagan Choloian and Aram Keshishian as assistants. Both monks at the time, currently Oshagan Choloian is the guide of the Armenian diocese of Kuwait, and the latter currently the Catholicos of the Great Home of Cilicia. *In 1969, the Lebanese Diocese board of Education invited Sarkis Choloian to guide the school. He first acted as a senior teacher then as principal until the end of the 1984-1985 academic year. During his reign the Mardikian Elementary school grew and starting from 1981, step by step climbed the secondary school levels. In the reign of S. Choloian, the number of students increases to such an extent that the school grounds are no longer capable of accepting any more students. The rise in students forces the administration to reject any newcomers. In the course of 1984-1985 academic year, Catholicos Karekin the second comes to the rescue of the schools situation. The 10,000 m2 land in Dbayyeh, bought by the handsome donation of Vatche Manoukian and put under the disposal of the Catholicosate of Cilicia, along with the school buildings located on the property are given to the Mardikian School to transport there. After this arrangement, the school was renamed in honor of Vatche Manoukians father, Yeghishe Manoukian, and beginning in 1985, the school became Yeghishe Manoukian National Secondary School. For the 1985-1986 academic year, Papken Papazian and Manoushag Boyadjian were invited to become the principals of the school. At the end of the second year the school became a fully functioning college. Recent history After the death of Papazian in February 1990, Manoushag Boyadjian conducted the school management until her death in March 2005. In September 2005, Seta Boyadjian (Manoushag Boyadjian's sister) was assigned principal of the school. She remained principal for 6 years, until in 2011 Zohrab Ghazarian was assigned principal.

Background Anna was the third of four daughters born to John Kantakouzenos and his wife Irene Palaiologia (Eulogia Palaiologina), sister of Michael VIII Palaiologos. Anna and her three sisters all lived to adulthood, they were: Theodora Raoulaina, wife of George Mouzalon, Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene, Empress consort of Bulgaria and Eugenia Palaiologina Kantakouzene, wife of Syrgiannes and mother of Syrgiannes Palaiologos. Marriage to Nikephoros Anna was married in the autumn of 1264 to Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas as part of a peace agreement between her uncle Emperor Michael and Nikephoros' father Michael II Komnenos Doukas, the leader of the pro-Byzantine party in Epirus.Fine (1994), p. 169. Anna dominated her husband,Fine (1994), p. 235. similar to her sisters Maria and Theodora. She became Despotess of Neopatras in 1289.BYZANTIUM, Medieval Lands Nikephoros had been married once before to Maria, the daughter of Emperor Theodore II Doukas Laskaris and had one daughter, Catherine. After the restoration of Orthodoxy under Andronikos II Palaiologos in 1282, Nikephoros renewed the alliance with the Byzantine Empire through Anna, who travelled to Constantinople to arrange the treaty; Anna herself served the interests of the Byzantine court. In 1284 they lured Michael, the son of John Doukas of Thessaly, to Epirus with the promise of a dynastic alliance, and had him arrested and sent off to Constantinople. This drew Nikephoros into a war against his half-brother, who ravaged the environs of Arta in retaliation in 1285. Anna embarked on an ambitious project of uniting the houses of Epirus and Constantinople by marrying her daughter Thamar to Michael IX Palaiologos, Andronikos II's son and co-emperor. Although this project failed, in 1290 her young son Thomas was conferred the dignity of Despot by the emperor. The anti-Byzantine aristocracy now persuaded Nikephoros to open negotiations with King Charles II of Naples in 1291, which provoked a Byzantine invasion. This sealed the alliance with Naples, and Charles II's intervention through his vassals Count Riccardo Orsini of Cephalonia and Prince Florent of Achaea helped contain the Byzantine advance. The couple now married their second daughter Maria to the heir to Cephalonia and their daughter Thamar to Charles II's son Philip I of Taranto. Thamar was given the right to inherit Epirus instead of her brother, and Charles II promised that she would be allowed to remain in the Orthodox faith. The wedding took place in 1294 and involved the transfer of several coastal fortresses to Philip as Thamar's dowry. Philip simultaneously received his father's rights and claims in Greece. Regency Nikephoros died between September 1296 and July 1298. Anna ensured the succession of their underage son Thomas, although Philip had been promised to inherit Epirus in right of his wife Thamar. Charles II of Naples demanded that Epirus be turned over to Philip and Thamar, but Anna refused, claiming that the arrangement had been broken when Thamar had been forced to abandon her Orthodox faith. In 1304 Anna sought support from Emperor Andronikos II. An alliance was concluded and sealed by the marriage of young Thomas to Anna Palaiologina, the daughter of the co-Emperor Michael IX Palaiologos, Andronikos' granddaughter.Fine (1994), p. 237. The actual marriage took place in 1307 or 1313. In the meantime Charles II sent troops into Epirus, but they were repulsed and the Epirotes advanced into the Angevin lands in the western Balkans, recovering Butrint and Naupaktos in 1304‚Äì1305. A new Angevin invasion in 1307, aiming to overthrow Anna Women In Power 1250 - 1300 ended with a compromise by which Philip of Taranto was ceded many of the fortresses that had been retaken by the Epirotes in the previous war.

It is based on SDS-PAGE whereby samples tested for cathepsin activity are loaded into a polyacrylamide gel and then separated by molecular weight. Gelatin is embedded in the gel itself, providing a substrate for the enzymes to hydrolyze. While the proform of cathepsins are generally stable, once activated, proteases such as cathepsin K are vulnerable to inactivation in neutral pH environments. This loss of activity complicates detection of these enzymes. Zymography, through its high sensitivity and multiplex nature allows for the simultaneous distinction between multiple cathepsins. Very small amounts of enzymatic activity can be elucidated and is capable of resolving a femtomole of cathepsin K activity. Zymography protocol Tissue samples are lysed in buffer supplemented with leupeptin to maintain enzymatic activity. The samples are standardized for protein concentration and then loaded into a polyacrylamide gel for SDS-PAGE. After separation of proteins by molecular weight is complete, the gel is incubated in a renaturing buffer to restore enzymatic activity. During loading, a non-reducing buffer was used to preserve protein disulfide bonds. After the renaturing period, the gel is then incubated in assay buffer to allow the now active cathepsins to proteolyze the gelatin impregnated in the gel. This process takes place overnight. The next day, the gel is analyzed for regions of gelatin degradation by coomassie blue staining. Patches of gel that are no longer blue following a destain wash are noted. These bands are then correlated to their respective molecular weights in order to identify which cathepsins were active in the sample.

History  In 2000, shortly after the convention of the 9th Congress of the Syrian Communist Party, 80% of the membership of Damascus organization of the Party were expelled. As this illegitimate procedure was widened to cover more party organizations all over Syria, the affected comrades and party organizations formed the National Committee for the Unity of the Syrian Communists, which re-published the Kassioun newspaper. Unlike the two other communist factions, the new communist current was not part of the National Progressive Front which brought together the ruling Ba'ath Party and other \\"legal\\" parties. It took the communist group until 2012 to form and declare an officially registered party known as the People's Will Party, that convened its 10th Periodical, 1st after registration, Congress in June 2013. The party ran independent candidates in the parliamentary elections in 2003 and 2007 but failed to win any seats. Nonetheless, in the parliamentary elections of 2012, the Popular Front for Change and Liberation, a coalition formed by the PWP, took 5 seats. The Party joined the demonstrations at the start of the 2011 Syrian Crisis, and a number of its activists in Damascus, Homs and Deir ez-Zur lost their lives at the hands of the governmental police and other services, while others were detained or arrested in other Syrian governorates. As the Syrian popular movement turned armed and violent, the PWP continued with its humanitarian aids and mediation efforts in some conflict zones. The PWP seeks a comprehensive, radical and democratic change of the regime as a whole, not only the removal of the President. Economically, the party calls for a reversal of the liberalization ‚Äúreforms‚Äú that started in 2005 and laid the foundation for the social and political unrest in Syria, and calls for the creation of a strong national economy. Dr. Kadri Jamil, one of PWP Council Secretaries, was a member of the committee that drafted amendments to the Constitution of Syria in response to the 2011 Syrian protests. The amendments were approved in the Syrian constitutional referendum in 2012 and allowed multiparty elections in Syria.  Leadership  In organization, the People's Will Party follows democratic centralism. Nonetheless, it has no assignment for a Secretary General; instead, a collective leadership of the members of the Central Council that are elected in the General Conference rules the party. The Central Council elects its members of the Presidium and members of the Secretariat to undertake daily tasks.

It takes place in Ushitsu of Noto Peninsula and is dedicated to the Yasaka Shrine. The festival takes place every year in July on the first Friday and Saturday of the month.  Summary  Abare Festival is commonly referred to as \\"the Fire & Violence Festival\\". Visitors can watch kiriko („Ç≠„É™„Ç≥, Noto's unique illuminated lantern floats) and mikoshi („Åø„Åì„Åó, portable shrines) being carried through the streets, eat festival foods, hear taiko drums and see many people dressed in their summer festival wear („ÇÜ„Åã„Åü). The kirikos and mikoshis are first blessed by priests and sake is poured over them and into the mouths of the men who carry them. From this point onwards, sake flows freely all night long. The kiriko are sponsored by neighborhoods within Ushitsu and are usually carried by local residents, or former residents., The festival is held on the first Friday through Saturday of July every year (previously on July 7 and 8) as the first Noto kiriko festivals, which are held all over Noto, Ishikawa from July to September. Abare festival is dedicated to Yasaka Shrine in Ushitsu. After kiriko are showcased in town streets, 40 giant kiriko are gathered at the pier, where huge bonfires are set, with melody of taiko drums, gongs, and flutes around the fire., The purpose of this festival is to hustle bravely and violently as its name indicates. It is said that the more violently people behave, the more god will delight as this rampage represents enshrined Susanoo no Mikoto, who is known as a destructive deity.  Detail  On the first night, Friday, of the festivities the Mikoshi and about 40 Kiriko make their way through the streets of Ushitsu (a village inside of Noto Town) and finally gather in front of the city hall to weave around large bonfires resting on the top of large poles. Groups of men (and rarely women) work together to carry the large wooden Kiriko while children sit atop it playing drums and flutes. The men often carry the Kiriko so close to the suspended bonfires that they suffer minor or major burns from the falling sparks. The children usually wear wet towels draped over their heads to protect them from the sparks. On the second night, Saturday, the Kirikos once again weave their way around town but the main attraction is the wooden Mikoshis that are carried (by about 12 men) down the main street to be blessed. The men carrying the Mikoshi continually thrash it against the ground and grind it into the asphalt of the street, doing their best to break it as much as possible. After passing 3 different checkpoints where they stop to pray, receive blessings, and drink sake; the men will throw the Mikoshi off a small bridge (roughly 7 meters tall) into a small river that runs through the middle of town. The men will then jump into the river and bash the Mikoshi against the bridge's concrete support beam while splashing one another. Handling the Mikoshi these way means following the divine will, hence such rough handling is actually a manner of prayer. After that they will take the Mikoshi a short way up the road to a second river and throw the Mikoshi off the side of the road into the second river. At this point they will bash the Mikoshi up against a hard bit of the road to attempt to further shatter the top of the Mikoshi. At the second river, a bonfire, which has been lit above them, showers sparks and flaming debris down upon their heads as they attempt to destroy the Mikoshi. The men vigorously splash one another to protect themselves from the fire. Then the men will retrieve the Mikoshi from the river and take it to Yasaka Shrine, a Shinto Shrine („Åò„Çì„Åò„ÇÉ). In front of the shrine there is a large bonfire on the ground in which they will repeatedly throw the Mikoshi and then retrieve it afterwards, when they believe that they have properly destroyed the Mikoshi they will take it through the gate of the shrine where the priests will judge if it has been properly destroyed. If the priests decline to take the Mikoshi into the shrine, the men will return to throwing it in and out of the bonfire and smashing it upon the ground before returning it to be inspected by the priests once more. Eventually the priests will accept the Mikoshi into the shrine. This happens twice, the first wooden Mikoshi being destroyed between 10:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. and the second between 12:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. Despite the name, the Fire and Violence festival is safe to attend for all ages. The 12 men destroying the Mikoshi are the only ones that are in any danger of physical harm.  Origin  Abare Festival originated around 1665 to counteract violent epidemic raging in Noto, Ishikawa. Local people invited Gozu Tenno from Yasaka Shrine in Kyoto and held a big religious ceremony to pray for calming down of the epidemic. Then a big bee came from somewhere and stung people one after another. People who were stung were soon cured from the epidemic so that the delighted local people visited Yasaka Shrine carrying Kiriko.

During its festival run, \\"Home\\" was nominated for Best Picture at the 2018 Los Angeles Film Awards, and won Best Actor in an Indie Film and Best Duo for Young and Hsieh, respectively. In the 2018 Best Shorts Festival, Young received the Humanitarian Award of Distinction and the Award of Excellence for Disability Issues for the film, as well as Best Actor and Actress awards for Young and Hsieh respectively. \\"Home\\" has since been distributed on Amazon. In 2019, Young joined James Wan's upcoming film Malignant as the male lead. In 2020, Young and Janet Hsieh released an educational podcast titled \\"Jolly Good Kangaroo\\", that focuses on children's storytelling in British and American English. Young is represented in Singapore by Fly Entertainment, and Agency for the Performing Arts (APA) in the US. Philanthropy In 2012 and 2013, Young partnered with Kiehl's to raise money and awareness for those with Autism. Young is the eldest of four brothers, two of whom are autistic; raising awareness of autism and raising funds to support those with autism is a cause that Young feels strongly about. \\"People with autism are just that ‚Äì people first and foremost, with a condition that is autism...they have hobbies, they have loves, they have passions, but all of it is locked within this condition that is autism. There's no cure for autism at the moment, but with treatments at an early age, their thought potential can be unlocked.\\" In addition to his charity work, Young has also fronted two government-funded youth campaigns: the anti-drug campaign Dance Works! 2012, sponsored by Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore, and the Health Promotion Board in Singapore's Bounce Back Stronger campaign for youth resilience.

Plant macrofossil evidence reveals that this tree became extinct during the Late Quaternary period of Earth's history. At present, this is the only documented plant extinction from this geologic era. Hypotheses as to what specifically drove the extinction remain unresolved, but rapid and widespread climatic changes coincided with Picea critchfieldii's decline and ultimate extinction.  Description = Species discovery  Discoverers = Picea critchfieldii was first described in 1999 by Stephen T. Jackson and Chengyu Weng in a paper titled, \\"Late Quaternary Extinction of a Tree Species In Eastern North America\\" published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States. = Namesake = Picea critchfieldii, or Critchfield's spruce, was named after botanist William B. Critchfield. The plant was named to honor Critchfield and his longstanding \\"advocacy of understanding the role of Quaternary history in shaping genetic structure of conifer populations.\\" This is an image of Picea glauca. Picea glauca is an extant species of spruce. Prior to recognition as a distinct, extinct species of spruce, Picea critchfieldii was initially thought to represent Picea glauca. Since Picea critchfieldii remains extinct to date, Picea glauca can be used as a reference image to visualize a related, similar species.  Macrofossil evidence  To describe Picea critchfieldii as a new and distinct species, carefully analyzed plant macrofossil specimens of fossilized spruce needles and cones were assessed. After close examination, these specimens could not be assigned to any extant species of Picea given distinctive morphological and anatomical features of their needles and cones. Fossil evidence thus supports the former existence of a distinct species of spruce: Picea critchfieldii. Plant macrofossils are fossilized deposits that represent the multicellular sporophyte stage in the plant life cycle. Given significant variability among the sporophyte stage for different plant species, macrofossil specimens can exist as seeds, fruits, ovulate cones, needles, leaves, buds, and a host of other forms. The size of macrofossils and the depositional material in which they are preserved can similarly vary. The sporophyte phase of plants is morphologically distinct between different species, which permits species- level identification of macrofossil specimens and thus provides information about past vegetation with \\"high taxonomic resolution\\". To glean species-level data, macrofossil specimens must be carefully studied for distinct morphological and anatonomical features that permit their definitive assignment to a particular species, whether extant or extinct. The specificity and distinctiveness of macrofossil deposits of cones, seeds, and needles were paramount to the identification of the not-previously-known spruce Picea critchfieldii. = Cones = Picea critchfieldii had cylindrical ovulate cones with ‚Äúscales narrowly fan-shaped with rounded margins‚Äù that were somewhat irregular. The dimensions of a cone in its entirety varied between approximately 60‚Äì100 mm in length and 14‚Äì20 mm in diameter. The dimensions of the rounded, fan-shaped cone scales varied between 18‚Äì21 mm in length and 11-13.5 mm in width. = Seeds = Picea critchfieldii had ovate, winged seeds. The seeds varied in size from about 3.5-4.5 mm in length and 2.6-2.8 mm in width with wings spanning about 8‚Äì11 mm in length. = Needles = The needles of Picea critchfieldii were between 7‚Äì9 mm in length and 0.6-1.0 mm in diameter. These needles consisted of: a cross-section that was quadrangular, an acute apex, and two resin ducts.  Fossil pollen evidence  Fossil pollen data was also important to the description and documentation of Picea critchfieldii. Fossil pollen evidence reveals that Picea was once dominant in the region surrounding the macrofossil collection sites now known to represent the extinct Picea critchfieldii. Given Picea critchfieldii's presence, it is thought that the Picea pollen found to dominate in locations that coincide with fossil collection sites is likely attributable to the extinct spruce and thus reveals that Picea critchfieldii was once widespread in the region. Evidence from morphometric analyses of pollen collected from the Picea critchfieldii fossil site known as Tunica Hills reveals that pollen collected here is morphologically distinct from, and thus not attributable to, that of the extant Picea glauca, Picea mariana, and Picea rubens. Given the distinctiveness of fossil pollen grains collected from this site of known former Picea critchfieldii presence, scientists suggest that \\"the morphologically distinctive Tunica Hills Picea pollen was probably produced by the extinct spruce species Picea critchÔ¨Åeldii.\\" It remains difficult to conclude this definitively because Picea critchfieldii pollen has yet to be collected specifically within fossilized reproductive structures of the plant to confirm association; scientists nonetheless hypothesize that the pollen is most likely that of Picea critchfieldii given its distinctiveness from pollen of other extant taxa. Fossil pollen data, used in the field of palynology, represents fossilized deposits of plant pollen grains reflecting the gameotophyte stage in the plant life cycle and ranges in size from 5-150 micrometers. Fossil pollen data is used to infer past vegetation, but pollen grains, unlike macrofossils, are often unable to be distinguished beyond the genera level given morphological similarities among pollen grains of distinct species within the same genus. In some cases, pollen grains are morphologically indistinct even among different genera within the same plant family. As a result, fossil pollen often results in \\"taxonomic smoothing\\" that inhibits fine-scale resolution of past vegetation to the species level. However, examples of Picea pollen being identified as morphologically distinct, species-level units exist. Pollen from Picea glauca, Picea rubens, and Picea mariana has been characterized, classified, and assessed with relative accuracy based on distinct morphological attributes of each species. Similarly, close analysis of hypothesized Picea critchfieldii pollen demonstrates a species-level analysis of spruce pollen granules. Pollen data remains one of the primary mechanisms by which paleoecologists glean insight into past vegetation to catalog the historical presence of taxa on the landscape. Picea pollen identifiable to the species level is particularly useful. In the case of Picea critchfieldii, the careful analysis of plant macrofossils was paramount to the description of the species and the documentation of its extinction. The interpretation of morphologically distinct pollen, in conjunction with this fossil evidence, has helped further characterize its former presence and distribution on the landscape.  Distribution, habitat, and environmental context  Map of approximate fossil collection site locations of Picea critchfieldii specimens, based on Figure 1 of Jackson and Weng, 1999.  Geographic distribution  Former range extent = The geographic range of Picea critchfieldii spanned the southeastern United States, where it was once widespread. The species has been recorded from several sites dating to the Last Glacial Maximum in the Lower Mississippi Valley and in Georgia. Considering all fossil collection sites together, paleoecologists suspect the former range of Picea critchfieldii spanned over 240,000 km in this region. = Fossil site localities = Many of the fossils documenting Picea critchfieldii have been collected from the Tunica Hills region in Louisiana and Mississippi, which maps to 31¬∞N, 91¬∞29'W. The fossil specimens that aided in the discovery and description of Picea critchfieldii mostly originate from stream cut exposures composed of fluvial silt and clay soils from the Late Quaternary. Other documented collection sites occur in western Tennessee, southwestern Georgia, and northwestern Georgia.  Ecology  Co-occurring species = At the Tunica Hills sites where many fossil specimens of Picea critchfieldii have been discovered, collections of Quercus, Juglans nigra, Acer, Carpinus caroliniana, Fagus grandifolia, Carya, Ulmus americana, and Juniperus americana have also been made at these same sites. These species are all temperate hardwood taxa. Fossil pollen data from the Tunica Hills region dates to between 24,670 and 17,530 years ago and suggests that Picea was the dominant species in the regional uplands surrounding this area, where smaller populations of Quercus and other hardwood species also occurred. The former species assemblages revealed by macrofossil and pollen collections have no-analog to present plant communities in eastern North America. In other collection sites where Picea critchfieldii has been found, it is documented as co-occurring with various species of Pinus and with Picea glauca. These are cool-temperate conifer taxa. = Environmental and habitat tolerances = The species with which Picea critchfieldii has been found to co-occur reveal information about its presumed environmental and habitat tolerances. The fossil collections that demonstrate an association between Picea critchfieldii and temperate hardwood tree species suggests Picea critchfieldii could tolerate warmer climate conditions than other, extant Picea species. Though thought to have an affinity for warmer conditions than other Picea species given past assemblages, other fossil collection sites where the plant has been found to occur with cool-temperate conifers suggests some degree of overlap in the environmental tolerances of Picea critchfieldii and extant members of the genus. Eastern North American spruce species that remain extant have boreal and montane affinities and are entirely confined to cool climates. However, the affinities of extinct Picea critchfieldii likely differ from those of extant spruce given the environmental tolerances of the species with which it has been found to co- occur. Picea critchfieldii is presumed to have had warmer but still overlapping temperature tolerances as compared to extant Picea.  Late Quaternary context  The Late Quaternary is a time in geologic history, within the broader Quaternary Period, that encompasses approximately the last 25,000 years of Earth's history. During this time, continuous climate change has occurred across varying timescales with different degrees of magnitude. The Late Quaternary is well-represented in the geologic record at globally- distributed sites. Sites representative of the Late Quaternary that contain records of flora, fauna, and climates past can be dated with high degrees of accuracy through a variety of methods that allow observational inferences to be made at timescales between 10 and 10,000 years. As is true for Picea critchfieldii, pollen and macrofossil specimens from a variety of species present during the Late Quaternary have been collected and studied across the globe. Such specimens are tied to specific locations that can be assigned accurate historical dates, which can then be linked to past climate data that has been independently gleaned from other sources such as ice cores or tree rings. Pairing records of past biota with climate data allows paleoecologists to reconstruct past vegetational landscapes. Given the rich spatial and temporal data embedded in the geologic record of the Late Quaternary, changes in the vegetational composition and structure of the landscape can be studied with great detail. Picea critchfieldii existed on the landscape of North America during and directly preceding the Last Glacial Maximum of the Late Quaternary. Picea critchfieldii is currently the only plant extinction documented from the Late Quaternary period.  Extinction = Timing of extinction  The extinction of Picea critchfieldii is dated to approximately 15,000 years ago and represents the only documented tree species extinction of the Late Quaternary. This extinction dates to approximately the time when the Earth was transitioning out of the Last Glacial Maximum and into the Holocene period of the Quaternary.  Environmental change  During the transition between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene, the Earth was experiencing exceptional warming. During this deglaciation, the climate underwent rapid and abrupt changes. The discovery of Picea critchfieldii's extinction at the time of this rapid and continuous climate change suggests that such changes may have contributed to its demise.  Hypothesized causes of extinction  The definitive root cause of the extinction of Picea critchfieldii remains largely unresolved and is not currently tied to a specific, historical event or cause. There is no known linkage between human exploitation and the extinction of Picea critchfieldii, which differs from the presumed cause of contemporaneous mammal extinctions. Given dramatic climatic changes occurring during the Late Quaternary at the time the plant extinction was recorded, it is postulated that the extinction is at least broadly linked to changing climatic regimes. Within the context of broader climatic changes, hypothesized factors potentially contributing to the decline and extinction of Picea critchfieldii include: a pathogen, an inhibited dispersal ability, or a complete loss of suitable habitat.  Contemporaneous extinctions  Not only is Picea critchfieldii the only plant extinction documented during the Late Quaternary, but it is one of very few plant extinctions known from the entire Quaternary Period. In contrast to this one known plant extinction during the Late Quaternary, significant numbers of mammalian extinctions took place during the same period in what is known as the Quaternary Extinction Event. These extinctions are largely attributed to a complementary role of human exploitation and rapid environmental change during the last deglaciation. A myriad of hypotheses have been proposed to explain these mammalian extinctions, but the current scientific consensus ascribes a role for both climate and human impacts as driving large numbers of mammalian genera and species to extinction during the Late Quaternary. Though it remains possible that Picea critchfieldii is the only species to go extinct during the Late Quaternary, scientists suggest that ‚Äútaxonomic smoothing‚Äù within collected pollen data and insufficient collections of plant macrofossils could be camouflaging other potential plant extinctions. Further discovery and examination of plant macrofossils is needed to determine whether other plant extinctions have occurred in addition to the loss of Picea critchfieldii.  Biodiversity implications = Species' responses to change in the late Quaternary  The Late Quaternary was a time of continuous climatic changes of varying rates and magnitudes. As Late Quaternary climates changed, plant species responded as individuals in a variety of ways, including: toleration, migration, habitat shift, extinction, and altered population densities. Paleoecological evidence supports a tendency for plant species to historically pursue the ‚Äòmigration‚Äô route. The fossil record and the general lack of documented plant extinctions suggests that plant species have migrated far distances across continents in response to past environmental changes. Data from the fossil record also provides evidence that plant species have been able to respond to changing conditions by altering their population densities, transitioning between phases of rarity and abundance while nonetheless persisting on the landscape. Despite paleoecological support for migration, toleration, and population density changes as past responses to environmental change, the discovery of Picea critchfieldii reveals that extinction is another possible response.  Relation to modern climate change  With the discovery of Picea critchfieldii and its presumed linkage to climatic changes during the Last Glacial Maximum, ecologists conjecture that consideration of this species ‚Äúis potentially sobering in view of the likelihood of future climate changes, which could be of similar or greater rapidity, abruptness, and magnitude as those of the last glacial/interglacial‚Äù. Patterns of vegetational change are commonly used to infer future scenarios. Fossil records from the Late Quaternary, when the magnitude and rate of climate change mirrored that which is predicted for the future, are often used to inform how biota of the present might respond to ongoing global changes. However, scientists suggest that ‚Äúhistory is better suited to providing cautionary tales rather than specific images of future climate and vegetation change.‚Äù The demise and discovery of Picea critchfieldii is one such cautionary tale.

The name of the nearby Tuzigoot National Monument comes from an Apache word, Tuzigoot, meaning crooked water. The \\"crooked water\\" reference is to Pecks Lake, established in a cutoff meander of the river. The shallow lake gets most of its water from the river through a tunnel on the northwest corner of the property, downstream from a large slag heap from the former copper smelter at Clarkdale. Overflow from the lake passes over a weir at the east end of the lake into Tavasci Marsh. The surrounding area includes the capped and re-vegetated tailings pond of the smelter, which processed ore from the United Verde copper mine at Jerome. History Pecks Lake was built to provide process water for the smelter and recreation for the smelter community. Amenities included a nine-hole golf course, a dance hall, and a club house near the lake. Until 2003, the Town of Clarkdale leased the lake and surrounding property from the Phelps Dodge Corporation and made it available to the public for fishing and other forms of recreation. However, after the lease expired, Phelps Dodge (later acquired by Freeport-McMoRan) closed the property to the public. The lake is becoming eutrophic, choked with aquatic plants, including invasive water lilies and Eurasian milfoil. Peck's Lake supports populations of northern pike, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, and sunfish but no native fish species. Land-use debate In April 2010, Sustainable Clarkdale, an advocacy group, recommended that the Town of Clarkdale buy Pecks Lake and its surrounds from Freeport- McMoRan. The parcel, also known as Verde Valley Ranch, could then become home, the group said, to a variety of projects related to energy production (particularly solar, biomass, and plasma gasification), recreation, water purification, and commercial development--all with as little negative environmental impact as possible. The project would be known as the Clarkdale Sustainability Park. In November 2010, Freeport-McMoRan declined a Sustainability Park proposal by the Town of Clarkdale, suggesting that land uses on the parcel should be limited to recreation and habitat preservation consistent with those at Tuzigoot National Monument and Tavasci Marsh. Town officials said they would consider siting the Park elsewhere and that they hoped that Freeport-McMoRan would eventually agree to public ownership of Verde Valley Ranch and remediation of Pecks Lake.

It is native to eastern Canada and the eastern United States.Strophostyles helvula. NatureServe. Description It is an annual to perennial herbaceous vine, up to 3 m long, with light pubescence on the stem, leaves, and pods. The trifoliate leaves are often divided into three lobes, in a fiddle-shape (panduriform). They possess unique pea-like pink-purple flowers (fading to cream-yellow), with a gradually curving keel petal (the keel petal is one of the most distinguishing characters among the species of the genus). The fruit of S. helvola is up to 10 cm long, containing shiny black seeds with hairy coats originating from the inner surface of the pods.Strophostyles helvola. USDA NRCS Plant Guide. This seed coating lends the seeds buoyancy in water, which is thought to have contributed to its dispersal along major aquatic routes. File:Annual Wild Bean - Strophostyles helvola, Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge, Woodbridge, Virginia.jpgDetail of flowers File:Strophostyles helvola Tennessee.jpgDetail of fruit S. helvola is primarily diagnosed by its keel petal (prominent, thin, curving away from the banner at the distal end); long, cylindrical pods; and highly lobed leaves (though not always lobed, and Strophostyles umbellata may also show lobing). Taxonomy In addition to the type, at least one infraspecific taxon has been recognized, S. helvola var. missouriensis (S. Watson) Britton, although there is little evidence for distinct varieties of this species. A widely used orthographic variant is Strophostyles helvula, although only the former is taxonomically accepted.  Agricultural relevance  S. helvola is a wild relative of the cultivated common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), and could serve as an important model for understanding how herbaceous legumes adapt to different stressful environments. Specifically, S. helvola has coastal populations which show high salinity tolerance due to up-regulated genes.  Ecology  This bean grows in many habitat types, including disturbed areas, where it is a pioneer species, taking hold in areas where few other plants grow, and in several types of soil, especially sandy types, and it can grow in dry or moist conditions. It can often be found in seaside dune habitat, where arbuscular mycorrhizae help it withstand saline conditions.Tsang, A. and M. A. Maun. (1999). Mycorrhizal fungi increase salt tolerance of Strophostyles helvola in coastal foredunes. Plant Ecology 144 159-66.  Ethnobotany  This plant was used medicinally and as food by Native American peoples. The Houma people used it to treat typhoid and the Iroquois used it topically for poison ivy irritation and warts. The Choctaw people used the boiled, mashed roots for food.Strophostyles helvula. University of Michigan Ethnobotany. Discovery of large quantities of S. helvola seeds in archaeological sites also suggests a use similar to common bean at one time; though the seeds are smaller than cultivated bean, it is nutritionally similar and possesses the largest seeds and pods for the genus. The pods have been used in the present day as a sauteed vegetable in South Central Mindanao, Philippines.

Its programming is predominantly news. It has news reporters in most Arab countries. In the pan- Arab TV news market it competes against Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya, and also against Sky News Arabia and BBC Arabic Television. At its founding in 2012, many of Al Mayadeen's senior staff were formerly correspondents and editors at Al Jazeera. Al Mayadeen is viewed as pro-Hezbollah and pro-Syrian government. The channel is part of Al Mayadeen satellite media network, including a production company, a radio station, a website, an advertising company and other media-related projects. Besides the headquarters in Beirut, Al Mayadeen has a wide-ranging news network and three regional offices, one in Tunisia, another in Cairo with three reporters and a big studio, and a third in Tehran. Staff Ghassan bin Jiddo is the head of the board of directors and program director of the channel. He is the former head of Al Jazeera‚Äôs Iran and Beirut offices and a former talk show host in the channel. He resigned from the Qatar-based Al Jazeera in 2011, criticizing its reporting of the Syrian civil war. Jiddo seemingly accused Al Jazeera of deviating from \\"professional broadcasting standards\\", emphasizing that Al Mayadeen would remain objective and unbiased.

ABC-CLIO, 2009, p.153. was designated as the general manager of the channel, but he resigned one month before its launch. The staff of the channel include Lebanese journalists such as Sami Kulaib, Ali Hashem, the former Al Jazeera war correspondent, who resigned from the Qatari channel for stated that it refused to broadcast footage of militants on the Lebanese Syrian borders in the early days of the Syrian uprising, Zahi Wehbe, Lina Zahreddine, Lana Mudawwar, Muhammad Alloush, Ahmad Abu Ali and Dina Zarkat. Additionally, two Syrian journalists, Ramia Ibrahim and Futoun Abbasi, and two Palestinian journalists Kamal Khalaf and Ahmad Sobh as well as Yemeni Mona Safwan are also among its staff. Like Jiddo, most of the channel's staff are the former Al Jazeera correspondents and editors. George Galloway, a former British MP, is a presenter for the channel.Patrick Kingsley \\"The TV stations where George Galloway and Julian Assange are stars\\", The Guardian, 28 August 2012 Retrieved 3 November 2013Tim Walker \\"What George Galloway neglected to mention in Syria debate\\", The Telegraph, 1 September 2013 Retrieved 3 November 2013 The channel has a network of reporters in Palestine (specifically, in Gaza and Ramallah) and also, in Jerusalem. Their task is reported to provide the channel with a daily news section in the news broadcast entitled ‚ÄúA Window Into Palestine.‚Äù In addition, there are reporters of the channel in Amman, Tripoli, Rabat, Khartoum, Mauritania and Comoros. The correspondent of the channel in Damascus was withdrawn in April 2014. Omar Abdel Qader, a Syrian cameraman working for Al Mayadeen, was killed by a sniper during clashes in Deir Ezzor on 8 March 2014.Syrian journalist killed covering fighting: Al- Mayadeen TV Daily Star, 9 March 2014 Programming Al Mayadeen is on air for 24 hours daily. As of September 2013, the channel had ten daily news reports and nearly 17 distinct programs. One of its programs is A Free Word, a show hosted by George Galloway. The channel had formerly aired a program, namely Hadeeth Dimashq (meaning \\"Damascus dialogue‚Äù in English), focusing on the Syrian civil war, until April 2014, when it was discontinued. Political alignment The name of the channel, Al Mayadeen, means \\"the squares\\" in English, indicating its objective \\"to provide coverage for the Arab popular actions on the squares of change in the context of the Arab spring revolutions\\". The channel argues that it provides journalism, which is ‚Äúcommitted to nationalist, pan-Arab and humanitarian issues within the template of professional journalistic objectivity.‚Äù In addition, it presents itself as a ‚Äúfree and independent media project‚Äù with 500 staff and reporters in Arab and Western capitals. Its slogan is ‚ÄúReality as it is‚Äù and its editorial policy emphasizes that Palestine and resistance movements wherever they are found are its point of reference. It was also stated that the Palestinian cause is the channel's centerpiece. France 24 and Mohammed Al Jazairy of Asharq Alawsat state that Al Mayadeen represents the latest expansion of Iran, Syria and Hezbollah in the field of media. It is further said by Zeina Karam of the Associated Press that the channel's close ally in Lebanon is the powerful Shiite group Hezbollah. Joe Khalil, the author of a book about television in the Arab world, told the Telegraph newspaper that the station is undoubtedly supportive of the Assad regime.Tim Walker What George Galloway neglected to mention in Syria debate, Telegraph, 1 Sep 2013 Al Mayadeen prefers to refer to the rebels in Syria as \\"terrorists,\\" and to the actions of the Syrian government against the rebels as \\"cleansing\\" when reporting the Syrian civil war. Following its first year of broadcast the channel began to be known by Matthew Keys as \\"anti-Al Jazeera\\". On 6 November 2015, the Saudi-controlled Arabsat satellite TV organization suspended and banned Al-Mayadeen from broadcasting on Arabsat's satellite system. The motive was the editorial stances of Al-Mayadeen news programs, including the spirit of Al-Mayadeen's coverage of the Saudi military intervention in the ongoing civil war in Yemen.Press TV News, 6 November 2015, \\"Arabsat suspends services to Lebanese al-Mayadeen\\". Syrian Arab News Agency, 6 November 2015, \\"Banning of Al-Mayadeen Channel from Broadcasting on Arabsat\\". Ownership It is stated that the owners of the channel are anonymous Arab businessmen. There are speculations about the funding of the channel. Western media reports that the channel is a propaganda platform for Iran and Hezbollah and is funded by them. Omar Ibhais, a freelance Lebanese TV producer, stated that the channel is a joint venture between the Iranians and Rami Makhlouf, cousin of Syrian President Bashar Assad. According to the Telegraph, it has been alleged that its head of news is married to a former adviser to Assad. However, Ghassan bin Jiddo, director of the channel, denied this and stated that the channel is funded by Arab businessmen whose identity he would not disclose.

He is probably best known for his work;‚ÄòWhich ever way your nose bends‚Äô the first commission by the six piano ensemble Piano Circus, composed as a companion piece to Steve Reich‚Äôs ‚ÄòSix Pianos‚Äô & released on their eponymous album by Argo Records (UK) in 1992.  Early life  From 1983-1988, he studied composition and French horn at the Royal Academy of Music (London).  Career  In the late eighties he co-founded the group ‚Äò3 or 4 composers‚Äô (with Laurence Crane, Helen Ottaway, Melanie Pappenheim and Jocelyn Pook). He has released over sixty albums (mainly music for piano) through CD Baby, recorded using Finale (software) to write the score and then 'Pianissimo' virtual piano software for the performance. In 2012 his authorized arrangement for solo piano of Steve Reich's ‚ÄòClapping Music‚Äô was released on the album Which way is up?. Musical work His music is broadly described as postminimalist or minimalist, influenced by Terry Riley, Philip Glass et al. Another important influence was the work of the so-called English experimental composers such as Howard Skempton, Michael Parsons and Christopher Hobbs and his association with Laurence Crane and Graham Fitkin. Many of his works have a conceptual basis, or work through various processes as in Systems music. Rackham's works are mainly composed within a Diatonic scale. Tempo and dynamics (music) generally remain constant throughout the entirety of a piece. Various albums containing longer pieces ('Harmonium Music', 'Man Made Music', 'Slow Motion Music', 'Audiophilia', 'Triadic Variations' etc.) could be described as Ambient. A series of works dealing with fundamental aspects of music; 'Tune', 'Harmony', 'Rhythm' & 'Sixty Minutes' (which is primarily concerned with time) were released in the 2010s. His music has been used by dance companies and he has composed incidental music for plays including the first British production of The Man Outside by Wolfgang Borchert. He performed in the original production of Tony Harrison's The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus in Greece and at the Royal National Theatre London. Visual art Rackham's work has been exhibited in the UK, the Netherlands and Italy.

Finds associated with burials are an important source for ancient Greek culture, though Greek funerals are not as well documented as those of the ancient Romans.Peter Toohey, \\"Death and Burial in the Ancient World,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2010), vol. 1, p. 364. Mycenaean Period The Mycenaeans practiced a burial of the dead, and did so consistently.Unless otherwise indicated, information in this section comes from Linda Maria Gigante, entry on \\"Funerary Art,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, vol. 1, p. 245. The body of the deceased was prepared to lie in state, followed by a procession to the resting place, a single grave or a family tomb. Processions and ritual laments are depicted on burial chests (larnakes) from Tanagra. Grave goods such as jewelry, weapons, and vessels were arranged around the body on the floor of the tomb. Graveside rituals included libations and a meal, since food and broken cups are also found at tombs. A tomb at Marathon contained the remains of horses that may have been sacrificed at the site after drawing the funeral cart there. The Mycenaeans seems to have practiced secondary burial, when the deceased and associated grave goods were rearranged in the tomb to make room for new burials. Until about 1100 BC, group burials in chamber tombs predominated among Bronze Age Greeks.Toohey, \\"Death and Burial in the Ancient World,\\" in p. 365. Mycenaean cemeteries were located near population centers, with single graves for people of modest means and chamber tombs for elite families. The tholos is characteristic of Mycenaean elite tomb construction. The royal burials uncovered by Heinrich Schliemann in 1874 remain the most famous of the Mycenaean tombs. With grave goods indicating they were in use from about 1550 to 1500 BC, these were enclosed by walls almost two and a half centuries later‚Äîan indication that these ancestral dead continued to be honored. An exemplary stele depicting a man driving a chariot suggests the esteem in which physical prowess was held in this culture. Later Greeks thought of the Mycenaean period as an age of heroes, as represented in the Homeric epics. Greek hero cult centered on tombs. Archaic and Classical Greece Funeral monuments from the Kerameikos cemetery at Athens After 1100 BC, Greeks began to bury their dead in individual graves rather than group tombs. Athens, however, was a major exception; the Athenians normally cremated their dead and placed their ashes in an urn.Toohey, \\"Death and Burial in the Ancient World,\\" p. 365. During the early Archaic period, Greek cemeteries became larger, but grave goods decreased. This greater simplicity in burial coincided with the rise of democracy and the egalitarian military of the hoplite phalanx, and became pronounced during the early Classical period (5th century BC). During the 4th century, the decline of democracy and the return of aristocratic dominance was accompanied by more magnificent tombs that announced the occupants' status‚Äîmost notably, the vaulted tombs of the Macedonians, with painted walls and rich grave goods, the best example of which is the tomb at Vergina thought to belong to Philip II of Macedon. Woman tending a tomb memorial (lekythos, 420‚Äì410 BC) Funeral rites The Hirschfeld Krater, mid-8th century BC, from the late Geometric period of Greek pottery, depicting ekphora. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. A dying person might prepare by arranging future care for the children, praying, and assembling family members for a farewell.Robert Garland, \\"Death in Greek Literature,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, vol. 1, p. 371. Many funerary steles show the deceased, usually sitting or sometimes standing, clasping the hand of a standing survivor, often the spouse. When a third onlooker is present, the figure may be their adult child. Women played a major role in funeral rites. They were in charge of preparing the body, which was washed, anointed and adorned with a wreath. The mouth was sometimes sealed with a token or talisman, referred to as \\"Charon's obol\\" if a coin was used, and explained as payment for the ferryman of the dead to convey the soul from the world of the living to the world of the dead.Toohey, \\"Death and Burial in the Ancient World,\\" p. 363. Initiates into mystery religions might be furnished with a gold tablet, sometimes placed on the lips or otherwise positioned with the body, that offered instructions for navigating the afterlife and addressing the rulers of the underworld, Hades and Persephone; the German term Totenpass, \\"passport for the dead,\\" is sometimes used in modern scholarship for these. After the body was prepared, it was laid out for viewing on the second day. Kinswomen, wrapped in dark robes, stood round the bier, the chief mourner, either mother or wife, was at the head, and others behind. Alexiou,\\"The Ritual Lament In Greek Tradition,\\" pp. 6‚Äì7. This part of the funeral rites was called the prothesis. Women led the mourning by chanting dirges, tearing at their hair and clothing, and striking their torso, particularly their breasts. The Prothesis may have previously been an outdoor ceremony, but a law later passed by Solon decreed that the ceremony take place indoors. Johnston, \\"Restless Dead: Encounters Between the Living and the Dead in Ancient Greece,\\" p. 40. Before dawn on the third day, the funeral procession (ekphora) formed to carry the body to its resting place.Toohey, \\"Death and Burial in the Ancient World,\\" p. 364. At the time of the funeral, offerings were made to the deceased by only a relative and lover. The choai, or libation, and the haimacouria, or blood propitiation were two types of offerings. The mourner first dedicated a lock of hair, along with choai, which were libations of honey, milk, water, wine, perfumes, and oils mixed in varying amounts. A prayer then followed these libations. Then came the enagismata, which were offerings to the dead that included milk, honey, water, wine, celery, pelanon (a mixture of meal, honey, and oil), and kollyba (the first fruits of the crops and dried fresh fruits). Once the burial was complete, the house and household objects were thoroughly cleansed with seawater and hyssop, and the women most closely related to the dead took part in the ritual washing in clean water. Afterwards, there was a funeral feast called the perideipnon. The dead man was the host, and this feast was a sign of gratitude towards those who took part in burying him.

The ruler of the underworld was Hades, not the embodiment of death/personification of death, Thanatos, who was a relatively minor figure.Toohey, \\"Death and Burial in the Ancient World,\\" p. 367. Performing the correct rituals for the dead was essential, however, for assuring their successful passage into the afterlife, and unhappy revenants could be provoked by failures of the living to attend properly to either the rite of passage or continued maintenance through graveside libations and offerings, including hair clippings from the closest survivors. The dead were commemorated at certain times of the year, such as Genesia.Toohey, \\"Death and Burial in the Ancient World,\\" p. 368. Exceptional individuals might continue to receive cult maintenance in perpetuity as heroes, but most individuals faded after a few generations into the collective dead, in some areas of Greece referred to as \\"thrice-ancestors\\" (tritopatores), who also had annual festivals devoted to them.

It was constructed in 2012 to transfer water from the Melen Creek in D√ºzce Province to the European side of Istanbul.CNN T√ºrk: \\"Melen hattƒ± Boƒüaz'ƒ± ge√ßti\\" (21-05-2012) Need for the aqueduct With a population of about 15 million, Istanbul is trying to secure its citizens' access to drinking water. Most clean water in Turkey (and, consequently, Istanbul) is located on the Asian borders of the country. Therefore, it is difficult to bring water to Istanbul's Asian side with hundreds of kilometres of pipelines, and another challenge to bring water to the European side of Istanbul with a tunnel dug 85 metres under the sea bed (145 metres under the sea surface) atop an active fault. Commissioning and finance The tunnel was commissioned by the Ministry of Forest and Water Management and constructed by an international consortium of Russian and Turkish companies (Mosmetrostroy, ALKE and STFA). The Melen Water Supply Project was funded mainly by JBIC (Japanese Bank for International Cooperation) and partly by DSI (State Hydraulic Works). Construction There were two phases to the project: the underwater-tunnel phase and the land- tunnel phase. The underwater phase was done by the TBM (tunnel boring machine) method, and the land part by blasting. The TBM-drilling part of the project was complete in March 2009 and a ceremony was held, with the attendance of ministers, bureaucrats, Russian diplomats and Kadir Topba≈ü, the mayor of Istanbul. The TBM is specially designed and constructed for this project by the German firm Herrenknecht, and is six metres in diameter. The average advancing speed of the TBM during the project was per day, with a maximum speed of 20.4 metres per day. After the tunneling works are finished, the tunnel is being lined by prefabricated concrete segments, after which come nine-metre-long steel pipes with an inside diameter of four metres. Herrenknecht Melen 7 project. Accessed January 29, 2011. Infrastructure The tunnel is under the sea level, resisting a pressure of . It is a steel tube of in diameter, which is inside a hard-rock type tunnel of in diameter, bored with high-technology machinery. Situated between Orta√ße≈üme (Beykoz) and Derbent (Sarƒ±yer) under the Bosphorus, the long waterway tunnel has a water flow rate of . Being the first stage of the Melen System that cost 2 billion TL, the waterway tunnel was constructed in 1,756 days and completed on 19 May 2012 without any accident. It will transfer a daily rate of 2.8 million m3 of water, which is two and half times higher than Istanbul's current water consumption. The Melen System will bring the water of the Melen Creek in D√ºzce Province from a distance of , and will ensure the needed water supply for Greater Istanbul until the 2060s. It is the first tunnel connecting two continents. There is a large railway project which will connect both sides of Istanbul as well, but it will be through submerged tubes placed on the sea bed and not by tunnelling. \\"Asia and Europa With a Water Conveyance Tunnel\\".

The story focuses on the friendship and rivalry between two women and the effects that come from the choices they make and the events that they cannot prevent. Plot Gold follows two friends and professional cycling rivals, Kate Meadows and Zoe Castle, through their lives until the London Olympics. Meeting at the age of nineteen at a cycling challenge, Kate chooses a family over cycling while Zoe maintains her profession, winning several medals at both Olympic Games and Commonwealth Games. Kate re-enters competitive cycling with hopes of competing in the London Olympics. Kate's daughter, Sophie, is seriously ill with leukemia during the preparation for the Olympics. Background Cleave stated that the then-upcoming 2012 Summer Olympics prompted him to write Gold, with his children also serving as a source of inspiration. He also did research on cycling as he wrote the book, with the book going through six drafts before its final version. Reception Critical reception for Gold was positive, with the Guardian praising it as \\"thrillingly good\\". The Toronto Star and Kirkus Reviews both gave positive reviews of the novel, with the Star stating that Gold was \\"a sports novel [that] transcends the tropes and clich√©s of sport journalism\\".

He worked principally as a painter, sculptor, and engraver, also taught, and was involved in the foundation of a number of institutions of culture and education. He is perhaps best known for his mural painting, typically imbued with \\"fervent social criticism\\". He is acclaimed as the first artist to borrow the traditional material of coloured cement as the medium for a \\"modern work of art\\". Publicity-shy, he is said to have turned down Mexico's Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes before finally accepting it in 2001. Before his death, Sotheby's described him as \\"the most important living Mexican artist up to date\\". Early life A number of episodes from his childhood have been used to cast light on his future artistic career. Born in P√°tzcuaro, Michoac√°n in 1908, as an infant he lived in Tacubaya during the Mexican Revolution; his school was near where the rival forces of Victoriano Huerta and Emiliano Zapata met in battle. One day he saw a dead body; he says that instead of fear his attitude was that of contemplation. According to a friend and prominent collector of his works, the young Alfredo began to draw aged six or seven, but chose to do so upon the linoleum floor of his home; nevertheless both his parents praised him. While at primary school, he regularly drew on the blackboard to accompany his teachers and illustrate their lessons, as encouragement to his fellow pupils. Between 1924 and 1927 he studied at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas in Mexico City, where formative influences included Mateo Salda√±a, Germ√°n Gedovius and Diego Rivera. He was soon on friendly terms with Diego Rivera as well as Rufino Tamayo, David Siqueiros, Jos√© Clemente Orozco and Frida Kahlo. As the oldest of three children, he took responsibility for the family after the death of his father; while a student, he studied in the mornings and worked in the afternoons so as to be able to provide financial support. He undertook further studies at the Escuela de Talla Directa and the Taller de Litograf√≠a of Emilio Amero. Career Mural by Alfredo Zalce at the state government palace in Morelia. View of the mural in the Palacio de Gobierno Much of Zalce's career was spent in teaching and cultural activities. He first went to Zacatecas to teach art but, since the Cristero War had ended only shortly before, the school was not permitted to operate owing to lingering political tensions. He taught drawing at various primary schools for the Secretariat of Education from 1932 to 1935. In 1944, he became a teacher at the La Esmeralda and Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas. He moved to Morelia in 1950 and became the director of the Escuela de Pintura y Escultura. He also worked as a professor at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Le√≥n and the Escuela Popular de Bellas Artes. Besides teaching, he illustrated books with academic and social themes. He was a founder or cofounder of the Escuela de Pintura of Tabasco, the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular, the Escuela de Pintura of Taxco in Guerrero, the Taller de Artes Pl√°sticas in Uruapan and the Escuela de Pintura y Artesan√≠as in Morelia. He was also a founder of the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios in 1933; one of its first missions was to oppose the favourable attitude at the time of many in Mexico towards Adolf Hitler. In 1930, he created a mural for the primary school in Ayotla, State of Mexico. In 1932, he worked in \\"fresco\\" at the Escuela para Mujeres in Mexico City. He painted murals in the former Talleres Gr√°ficos de la Naci√≥n in 1936; again in collaboration with Leopoldo M√©ndez at the Escuela Normal de Puebla in 1938; and at the Palacio de Gobierno and the C√°mera de Diputados in Michoac√°n with √Ångel Bracho in 1948. Between 1961 and 1962 he created the giant mural in bronze relief, History of Morelia, measuring 350 m2, at the Palacio de Gobierno of Michoac√°n. He staged his first public exhibition at the Jos√© Guadalupe Posada Gallery in Mexico City in 1932. In 1948, his works were presented at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. His works were also exhibited outside Mexico, and can now be found in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, the National Museum in Warsaw, the National Art Gallery in Sofia, and in Mexico City. Other works may be found at the Museo Regional Michoacano, the Casa Natal de Morelos and the Museo de Arte Comtempor√°neo Alfredo Zalco. In 1946 he illustrated a volume of drama and verse by Bernardo Ortiz de Montellano, making it \\"one of the most Mexican and most beautiful books of the year\\". He also contributed woodcuts to Cantos Ind√≠genos de M√©xico, a selection of indigenous Mexican songs including those of the Nahua and a Yaqui deer dance, compiled by folklorist Concha Michel. Zalce declined the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes twice before ultimately accepting it in 2001. Other awards bestowed upon him include the General√≠simo Morelos Prize in 1969 from the city of Morelia and the Vasco de Quiroga Prize in 1985 from P√°tzcuaro. In 1979, the government of Michoac√°n created the Premio de Artes Pl√°sticas Alfredo Zalce. Artistry Zalce was active in oil, acrylic, watercolour, pastel, ink, pencil, engraving, monotyping, serigraphy, batik, bronze, stone, ceramics, precious metals and more. As a muralist, he was the first to use coloured cement and often operated contrary to the trends of his time. He was a prominent exponent of figurativism and expressionism, popular in Mexico from the 1920s, and his work is typically characterized by its \\"precision and clarity\\"; his scenes of everyday life and of the common man are steeped in social criticism. The ability to draw was for him fundamental for any aspiring fine artist. Museo de Arte Contemporan√©o Alfredo Zalce Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo \\"Alfredo Zalce\\" (MACAZ) opened in Morelia in 1971. It contains eight or nine halls, of which all but one are used for temporary exhibitions of contemporary art from Mexico and abroad; the last is dedicated to the life and works of Alfredo Zalce. The permanent collection also includes works by Efra√≠n Vargas and others. The museum is housed in a nineteenth- century mansion in the Cuauht√©moc Forest. Personal life and death He had many \\"loving lady admirers\\". In the mid 1940s he married Frances DuCasse, an American artist from Chicago Illinois USA, who died in the early 1950s. The couple had been living in Mexico City, but had already moved to Morelia. Frances and Alfredo are both included in a group photograph of the primary members of the Taller de Graphica de Popular.

Biography Alessandro Oliva was born in Sassoferrato in 1409, the son of Alerenzio and Giovanna Oliva. His family was relatively humble in station. When he was three years old, he fell in a well, and was presumed dead when he was retrieved from the well; after he recovered nine hours later, his mother, believing his recovery was a miracle, his mother pledged the boy to the Order of the Hermits of St. Augustine. Oliva entered the Order of the Hermits of St. Augustine in 1413. He was sent to Matelica and later to Perugia to be educated. In Perugia, at age 12, he began his novitiate. As one of the best students, he was sent to the Studio generale in Rimini to complete his studies, and then entered the seminary there in 1423. He was then sent to Rome for eight years. In 1431, the prior of his order, Gregorio da Rimini, made Oliva a cursor in Rimini; then sent him to Perugia, where he became a lector in 1433. In Rimini, he received his baccalaureatus and regentis in 1436 and his magistralem lauream in 1438. After he was ordained as a priest, Oliva became a professor at the Augustinian convent at Perugia, a post he held for twenty years. In 1439, he was elected to a three-year term as provincial superior of his order for the March of Ancona. He became prior of his convent at Pergugia in 1449. He was elected Vicar of the Congregation of Perugia in 1452, 1456, and 1458. Pope Eugene IV later named him Procurator General of his entire order. He took part in the Council of Florence. In 1458, Pope Pius II had him elected Vicar General of his order. In 1459, he was elected the 28th Prior General of the Order of the Hermits of St. Augustine. During this period, Oliva delivered many sermons throughout Italy, especially in Naples, Siena, Florence, Bologna, Mantua, Ferrara, and Venice. He gained a reputation as a great sacred orator, especially for his sermons on the Nativity of Christ. In the consistory celebrated at Siena on 5 March 1460, Pope Pius II made Oliva a cardinal priest without Oliva's prior knowledge. He received the red hat on 8 March 1460 and the titular church of Santa Susanna on 19 March 1460. In 1460, he traveled to Ancona to receive Thomas Paleologus, the deposed Byzantine Emperor. The emperor presented the cardinal with the skull of Saint Andrew; Cardinal Oliva later took this relic to Rome, accompanied by Cardinals Basilios Bessarion and Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini. He was the Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals for 1461. On 16 November 1461 he was named apostolic administrator of the see of Camerino, a post he held until his death. He died in Tivoli on 20 August 1463. Pope Pius II officiated at his funeral. He is buried in Sant'Agostino.

She is best known as the musical composer of two 1966 anti-war plays, Jean-Claude van Itallie's social satire America Hurrah and Megan Terry's rock musical Viet Rock. De Pury studied piano and composition at the Conservatoire de Musique de Gen√®ve. She enjoyed the performing arts from a young age and, as a teen, she made frequent trips to Paris to see theatre. Later she moved to New York City, where she studied as an apprentice under the Open Theatre's director Joseph Chaikin. There she forged connections with artists active in New York's avant-garde theatre scene as well as the Black Panther Party. In 1965 she began a collaborative project with playwright and director Megan Terry who was working on a devised performance piece for the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club protesting the Vietnam War. Their ensemble improvisations at the Open Theatre laboratory resulted in Viet Rock, widely recognized as the first rock musical written and produced in the United States. De Pury followed the production as an accompanist when it premiered at the Yale Repertory Theatre in 1966 and later transferred to the Off-Broadway Martinique Theatre on 10 November 1966. During her time in the United States, de Pury also served as composer-in-residence for the Yale School of Drama and worked as a translator for the French playwright Jean Genet. De Pury is founder of the Santa Fe Ensemble Theatre in New Mexico and has directed free-lance productions in Basel, Bern, Bonn, Dublin, Sarajevo, Melbourne, New York and Cameroun. Upon returning to Switzerland, she became the administrative director of the Theatre de Carouge, a three-stage performing space in Geneva, Switzerland.

He has been recognized in the popular press as an influential Arab personality. Early life and education Ghassan bin Jiddo was born to a Muslim Tunisian father and a Christian Lebanese mother in Al Koussour, Tunisia, on 8 August 1962. He studied in Tunisia and was a student activist during his education years. Career Jiddo began his journalism career as a correspondent for the BBC Network, Al Hayat and other Arab newspapers as well as the Arab Institute for International Studies in Washington. Later, he began to serve as the bureau chief of Al Jazeera in Iran. Then, he became the bureau chief of Al Jazeera in Beirut. However, in April 2011, he resigned from Al Jazeera due to its lack of professionalism and objectivity in covering the Arab Spring. It was claimed that he did not endorse the station‚Äôs full coverage of the situation in Libya, Yemen, and Syria, while completely ignoring the crisis in Bahrain. In 2012, Jiddo became the director of Beirut-based pan-Arab satellite television station, Al Mayadeen, launched on 11 June 2012. Notable works During his Al Jazeera years, Jiddo worked on a documentary about Hezbollah. He had an exclusive interview with the secretary general of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, during the Israel-Lebanon conflict of 2006. In the same year, he also interviewed Julia Boutros, Walid Jumblat and former Cuban president Fidel Castro. He was regarded as the most watched and most popular presenter on Al Jazeera in 2007. He became an influential figure on the Al Jazeera network in 2010, with his program Hiwar Maftuh (\\"Open dialogue\\" in Arabic) that was one of the most commonly watched programs. He made insightful interviews with decision makers in his talk-show, and he received much acclaim for Al Jazeerah's coverage of the war in Lebanon in 2006. Views After his resignation from Al Jazeera, Jiddo claimed that the opposition in Syria and those who support them are responsible for the spilled Syrian blood, asserting that real opposition should never use weapons and violence against the citizens. Jiddo also appreciated Bashar Al Assad's ongoing reforms which disappointed those who wanted to interfere in Syria's internal affairs. In June 2012, he argued that \\"the regime of Bashar Al Assad is being subject to an international conspiracy\\". Personal life Jiddo is married to an Iranian woman, Neda Ghaemmaghami. Originally a Tunisian citizen, Ghassan has dual citizenship after acquiring the Lebanese nationality. He was chosen to be the 24th most influential Arab among 100 Arab personalities by Arabian Business in 2007 and 59th most influential Arab in the world among 500 Arab personalities again by Arabian Business in 2011. He was mentioned as a possible successor to then Al Jazeera director general Wadah Khanfar.

It is overseen by a board of directors composed of Christians from both Uganda and U.S. The university is non-denominational with no denomination oversight. Historically, it was founded by missionaries associate with the Churches of Christ and Christian Churches in the United States to provide a high-quality university education to a remote and underserved area in East Africa. Faculty and students participate in a mentoring program and a university environment that encompass spiritual, intellectual, interpersonal, and social-cultural dimensions of human development within a diverse student body. Location LIU opened in January 2012 on a leased campus near the center of Mbale, Uganda, by road it is approximately 250 kilometres (160 mi) northeast of Kampala, the capital and largest city in that country.[1] Its coordinates are: 1¬∞05'03.0\\"N, 34¬∞10'45.0\\"E (Latitude: 1.084167; Longitude: 34.179167). [2] LIU plans to occupy this leased campus until Phase 1 of the construction of the permanent campus is completed in June 2019, after which it will serve as an extension campus for evening courses and professional development programs. The new fifty-acre campus is located just outside Mbale municipality on the main road that goes west toward Kampala.

History Planning for LivingStone International University began as early as 2006. The LivingStone International University Strategic Plan 2009-2014 was completed December 19, 2007 and submitted to the Uganda National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) with the goal of being chartered as a fully accredited university by the Uganda government. The first step in this process was accomplished December 19, 2008 when the NCHE issued to LIU a Letter of Interim Authority. This allowed LIU to begin buying property, prepare curricula, hire faculty and staff and set up banking and other business tasks. LIU received its Provisional License from the NCHE in March, 2011. This prepared the way for the first student intake in January, 2012. Currently LIU is working under the guidance of the NCHE toward qualifying for a full university charter. On January 16, 2012 the inaugural class of LivingStone International University began with thirty-four students. With the second intake in September 2012, the student body grew to over fifty. In 2018 its enrollment reached almost 300. As of March 2019 over $5 million has been invested into the development of LIU, the acquisition of the land, the construction of Phase 1 of the new campus, the addition of programs and schools, scholarships and operating funds for operational expenses. Academics LIU offers both bachelors and diploma programmes in five schools. The five schools are: School of Business; School of Christian Ministry; School of Education; School of Computing and Information Technology; and School of Media Technology. Additional relevant future programs are planned for the near future. The university also offers a certificate course in Networking program [Cisco] Which takes six(6) to nine(9)month. Innovation and technology Each student at LIU is issued an electronic tablet or laptop as a medium for accessing textbooks as well as receiving other instructional materials and assignments from lecturers. There is currently a 1:5 computer-to-student ratio to provide technologically enhanced campus for the modern world that requires technological knowledge in the job market. Students in the Media Technology program receive hands-on experience in digital video and audio production on up-to-date equipment in the University's own studio. Students majoring in Computing and Information Technology have extensive hands-on training. Other programs utilize digital technology in various ways to enhance each program.

It is fully intact and in the Irish Governmental records it is registered as a National Monument and \\"Listed/Protected\\" structure, intended to protect its historic, architectural and aesthetic significance. History The castle of Ballyhannon, also known in later times as Castlefergus, most likely from its proximity to the River Fergus, is a towerhouse of atypical internal design within the context of the Co. Clare group of towerhouses. The castle stands in the townland of Castlefergus close to Latoon Creek, which itself feeds into the River Fergus. Ballyhannon townlands (both north and south) lie to the north east of the castle. The older spelling, Ballyhannan, is retained in these townland names. The townland name can be translated as O'Hannan's or O'Hannon's home. Although there are many substantial families of Hannon in Munster and Connaught, the name seldom appears in the annals of medieval Ireland.Martin Breen, Ballyhannon / Castlefergus ‚Äì History, Ballyhannon Castle website. Retrieved 6 June 2012. The death in 1266 of Maelisa O'Hannen, prior of Roscommon, is one of the few such entries. In the census of 1659 the name was found in considerable numbers in the Barony of Bunratty. The prefix O, was dropped in the submergence of Gaelic Ireland and has not been resumed. Strictly speaking Hannon is the anglicised form of the Gaelic O' hAnn√°in, a name chiefly associated with Co. Limerick.Edward MacLysaght. Irish Family Names (Irish Academic Press, Dublin 1985) p100 It was common at the end of the sixteenth century in many parts of Connaught and Munster.Rev. Patrick Woulfe. Irish Names and Surnames (Dublin 1923) p551 The Hannons or √ì hAnn√°in are a Dalcassian sept of noble Milesian ancestry whose members attained the status of knighthood, and whose patrimonial lands were in this area, south of Quin. Their name is still retained in the townlands of Ballyhannan north and Ballyhannan south. Although the Hannon name is remembered in the name of Ballyhannon Castle, their history is of an earlier period and no references to the family can be found in connection with the history of the castle itself. The castle was built about 1490 by Hugh, and possibly S√≠oda, sons of Donnchadh MacNamara.R. W. Twigge.MSS. Materials for a history of Clann-Cuilein, \\"Macnamara's country\\" (the Eastern division of Co. Clare) from the earliest times. Collected by R. W. Twigge. Royal Irish Academy.See also Standish Hayes O'Grady, Catalogue of Irish Manuscripts in the British Library. (London 1926; Reprint Dublin 1992), 'Castle Builders List', p72 This period was described by the noted antiquarian, T. J. Westropp, as the \\"Golden Age of castle-building in Thomond\\" because of the high standard of construction which had been achieved by the masons at this period. Although Ballyhannon Castle was the home of the MacNamaras for many centuries, there are some references to the O'Briens, on whose lands it stood, in relation to its history. For example in the year 1560, a grant was made by Queen Elizabeth I (7 September 1533 ‚Äì 24 March 1603) to Conor O'Brien (c.1534 - 1581), Earl of Thomond, of Ballyhannon Castle, and several other castles, previously held by Donnell O'Brien; \\"To hold in tail male, by service of one knight's fee\\",The Irish Fiants of the Tudor Sovereigns (Elizabeth). (De B√∫rca, Dublin 1994), Elizabeth, no. 288 meaning that the property would pass onto his male heirs, subject to military service to the Queen. In the lists of the castles of the county for the years 1570 and 1574 Ballyhannon Castle was owned by Covea Riogh MacNamara, son of Mahon.Castle Lists. 1570 & 1574 State Papers, Ireland, Elizabeth. Vol XXX, No. 68,1. (A list of the castles in Co. Clare in 1570). Published by Martin Breen, North Munster Antiquarian Journal, 1995, Vol. XXXVIState Papers, Ireland, Elizabeth. Vol XLV, No. 35,1. (A list of castles in Co. Clare in 1574). Published by R. W. Twigge, Journal of the North Munster Archaeological Society. Vol I, No 2. 1910. Some transcriptions of these lists record the castle as being owned by William Neylon. This was due to an error in aligning the columns during the transcription of the original manuscript lists. A fireplace with the inscription \\"H.T.E. 1576\\" was recorded by Westropp & Twigge in the 1890s, as being in the castle. This was one of the earliest dated fireplaces in the county, though it cannot now be located within the castle. In 1586 Queen Elizabeth I issued a pardon to Hugh, son of Covea MacNamara, of Ballyhannon Castle for being in rebellion. He had to provide sureties for his future good behaviour and answer at the local courts as requested.The Irish Fiants of the Tudor Sovereigns (Elizabeth). (De B√∫rca, Dublin 1994), Elizabeth, no. 4860 In the 1626 rental of the 5th Earl of Thomond, Henry O'Brien (c.1588 - 1639), Ballyhannon Castle was listed as being rented to one Robert Hawksworth, with one quarter of land for the sum of ¬£4.00.Petworth House Archives. MSS C27/A39. 1626 Rental of Thomond Property. It is likely that Hawksworth was one of the many English Protestant settlers brought into the county by the O'Briens and settled on the O'Brien properties in Thomond during this period. The settling of English Protestants on lands of the native Irish Catholics precipitated the 1641 rebellion and many records exist of the Irish despoiling the settlers and turning them out of their newly acquired lands and properties. The MacNamaras of Ballyhannon acted no differently from the other displaced Irish. John Smith of Latoon complained of his losses which, \\"amounted to ¬£1,354, including his lease for life of Lattoon, and his outlay upon buildings and sea embankments.\\" He complained that Oliver Delahoyde of Fomerla Castle in Tulla, \\"with fifty men came, on the night of 15 January 1642, and stripped him of part of his goods. The work of spoliation was subsequently completed by the MacNamaras of Ballyhannon\\" among others. Most of the Irish landowners who took part in this rebellion were later stripped of their possessions. Among those noted as having forfeited their property after the rebellion was Mahone MacNamara of Ballyhannon. His property was disposed of to Pierce Creagh (a Protestant settler) and to the Earl of Thomond, Barnabas O'Brien (c.1590 - 1657), 6th Earl.Creagh also received property at Dangan in Quin. After the rebellion, the Cromwellian campaign attempted to complete the subjugation of the native Irish, and many of their castles were dismantled by the Commonwealth forces to render them defenceless. Ballyhannon appears to have escaped this destruction and a sketch of the castle in 1675, which survives in the \\"Edenvale Survey\\", shows it to have been roofed and in good condition. The castle appears to be surrounded by a bawn wall with a gate and loophole windows at this time.Munster Antiquarian Journal, Vol. 45, 2005. The Edenvale Castle Survey of Co. Clare 1671-79. Brian √ì D√°laigh, Martin Breen & Rist√©ard Ua Cr√≥in√≠n, p43 With the assention to the English throne of the Catholic King James II (14 October 1633 ‚Äì 16 September 1701) in 1685, the fate of the native Irish improved somewhat for a time. Ballyhannon Castle was one of the castles noted by Sir Daniel O'Brien, Viscount Clare, as being suitable for the imprisonment of Protestant settlers who were now being dispossessed. A letter written in 1689 describing the events of the time is worth recording. \\"Take every one of them that are young (Seir or Mr.), and let the common sort lie in the prison, and the rest strictly guarded, or rather put into some strong castle that has a geate to be locked on the outside like Ballyhannon\\".Philip Dwyer, The Diocese of Killaloe, (Dublin 1878), p389.See also John Ainsworth. The Inchiquin Manuscripts (Dublin 1961), no. 50 Pierce Creagh who had received part of the MacNamara property at Ballyhannon after the rebellion was named as one of those to be imprisoned in the above letter from Sir Daniel O'Brien. The castle is also mentioned in 1690 when Thomas Hickman, who seemed to be living in fear during another upsurge in the conflict, asked Sir Donough O'Brien to collect some of his belongings from Ballyhannon Castle and to keep other possessions of his in a safe place, as he expected the castle was soon to be garrisoned.John Ainsworth. The Inchiquin Manuscripts (Dublin 1961), no. 78 The castle appears on Henry Pelham's \\"Grand Jury\\" map of 1787 under the names Ballyhannon and Castlefergus, which is the first time Castlefergus appears as the name of the castle. Hely Dutton, writing in 1808, records the castle as: \\"Fergus ‚Äì inhabited and lately white- washed! \\".Hely Dutton. A Statistical Survey of the County of Clare, (1808), p310 There are also some references to the Blood family of Castlefergus, though these relate most likely to Castlefergus House which stood south west of the castle and is now demolished.Hugh W. L. Weir. Houses of Clare, (Whitegate 1986), p66 Charlotte Blood, daughter of William Blood, who was murdered at his house at Applevale near Corofin, married her cousin Matthew Henry Blood, M.D. of Castlefergus in 1831.The Other Clare Vol. 16 p51 Westropp, writing in 1917 notes some curious traces of settlement in the fields at Castlefergus,Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland Vol. XLVII, 1917, p15 most likely the remains of ringforts and other early Bronze Age habitation sites. Samuel Lewis, writing, in 1837, notes Castlefergus as: \\"The fine modern residence\\" of William Smith Blood Esq. He adds: \\"adjoining which are the remains of the ancient edifice\\",Samuel Lewis, A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, (Baltimore 1984, reprint) Vol. I p496 & Vol. II p478/9 telling us that by this date the castle was uninhabited, probably for the first time in 350 years. By 1858 the castle was ivy-covered and described as: \\"a fine old green-mantled tower\\" on the grounds of Castlefergus House.An Ennis Miscellany, (Ed. Joseph Power) (Ennis 1990), p131 The American millionaire and oil heiress Elizabeth Phillips (of Phillips Petroleum) and her husband Henry D. Irwin, who chose to call it \\"Ballyhannan Castle\\", (using the older townland spelling), restored the building to its former glory in 1970. It is currently rented out to top-of-the-market tourists as an out-of-the-way destination. It was also home to rock stars and several American film stars during film making in the region. Robert Twigge describes the castle in the early 1900s as follows: \\"The castle stands on a low rock, scarped to the west and had no outworks, (the bawn noted in 1675 having been removed by this time). The very perfect tower, measuring , is in excellent preservation, having been inhabited in the last century. The pointed south door is defended by a shot-hole on the left and a murder hole above. The stair mounts round the s.w. angle, and at the 14th step a long corridor with 2 lights in the w. wall is reached. At the n. end a spiral staircase of 72 steps leads to the top. At the 12th step from the corridor another passage through the n. wall is reached. 5 curved steps at the s. end of the w. corridor lead to a similar passage along the s. wall over the porch and lodge. There is a handsome trefoil headed window of 2 lights in the s.w. angle and a garderobe to the s.e. angle. Mounting the spiral stair still higher other corridors, over the lower ones, in the w. and s. sides, are reached. There are 4 main stories under the stone vault forming the roof. The basement story has very deep recesses under the corridor and the 2 on the n. side have a narrow chamfered screen between them. A fireplace bears the date 1576, but this was of course a later addition to the building\\".

The company's movement style encompasses modern dance, acrobatics, and gymnastics. Diavolo has been based in Los Angeles since its founding, and has toured across the United States as well as Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The company Upon completion of his MFA (Dance and Choreography) at the California Institute of the Arts, Jacques Heim started Diavolo  Architecture in Motion, which performs acrobatic and modern dance movement set on a variety of oversized architectural structures. These structures serve as a backdrop to the dramatic movements that create metaphors for humanity's everyday struggles‚Äîrelationships, the absurdity of life, and the attempt to maintain our humanity in an increasingly technological world. Alongside his position as Artistic Director of Diavolo, Heim was hired in 2005 by Cirque du Soleil to choreograph a show in Las Vegas called K√†. Heim has also choreographed for television shows, movies, as well as special events worldwide. On television, his work appeared on BBC America's Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series),Brett Love, \\"Dancing with the Stars: Week Two Results\\" HuffPost TV, 03/25/08. as well as Bravo's Step It Up and Dance.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3045034/ Jacques Heim IMDB Page. However, most of Heim's time is spent choreographing for and touring with Diavolo. The company's repertoire presents dance that is redefined \\"through dynamic movement, enlightening communities through trust, teamwork, and individual expression\\" as articulated in the company's mission statement.http://www.diavolo.org \\"Who We Are: Diavolo Aesthetic.\\" Beginning with Bonjour/Sleepwalking, which was choreographed in 1992, Heim has created and continues to create pieces that epitomize the Diavolo aesthetic emphasized in the mission statement. Diavolo made its European debut at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1995, and in 1998, the company opened the performance series at the new Getty Center Museum in Los Angeles. Diavolo's first full- evening length work, Catapult, was created in 1999, which was also the year of the first full North American tour for the company. In spring 2002, Diavolo created a second smaller company to perform in a cabaret-style show, which ran for eight weeks at the New Shinagawa Prince Hotel in Tokyo, Japan. Diavolo collaborated with the Los Angeles Philharmonic to create a trilogy of dance works performed at the Hollywood Bowl. In 2007, Foreign Bodies premiered, set to the music of Esa-Pekka Salonen, followed by Fearful Symmetries in 2010, set to the music of John Adams. In 2013, Fluid Infinities, set to the music of Philip Glass, completed the trilogy on the Hollywood Bowl stage.http://www.diavolo.org/ \\"Who We Are: About Diavolo.\\" Diavolo also engages in community work and educational outreach, which includes holding classes, workshops, and seminars for children and adults. Many of the workshops are regularly held at schools, hospitals, and juvenile detention centers. Repertoire The most notable pieces in Diavolo's repertoire are: Catapult (1999), Trajectoire (1999, 2001), Humachina (2002, 2006), L'Espace Du Temps, The Trilogy [Foreign Bodies (2007), Fearful Symmetries (2010), Fluid Infinities (2013)], and Transit Space (2012).

At the launch of its pilot programs in 2012, The Diavolo Institute received funding from the James Irvine Foundation, the W.M. Keck Foundation, and others. The Diavolo Institute provides dance education and active arts participation for low-income youth and their families in the Los Angeles area. The program includes highlights such as: L.A. Familia (a multi-generational dance night that uses dance and everyday movement to get entire families working together), L.A. Unity (a regular workshop series that culminates in school and community performances on the distinct Diavolo set pieces), and T.R.U.S.T. (an interactive in-school assembly show, featuring trust exercises and student participation). In 2010, Diavolo received an American Masterpieces grant with the University of Georgia Research Foundation from the National Endowment for the Arts to fund educational activities.

He is best known for his Specimens of the Early English Poets and Specimens of Early English Metrical Romances, which played an influential part in acquainting the general reading public with Middle English poetry.  Early life  George Ellis was born in Jamaica on 19 December 1753, the posthumous son of a sugar-planter. His grandfather, also called George Ellis, was Chief Justice of Jamaica, and Edward Long, author of The History of Jamaica, was a maternal uncle.Gawthrop pp. 2‚Äì3Fisher His full name was George Rose Ellis.Barry Higman, Montpelier (Kingston: University of the West Indies Press, 1998), pp. 20, 24. He was brought to England in 1755, and according to the ODNB educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge.Ellis is not, however, listed in Venn's Alumni Cantabrigienses. He soon made a name for himself in Whig society as a young man of wit, charm and literary talent. Ellis published two volumes of light verse, Bath; Its Beauties and Amusements (1777) and Poetical Tales of Gregory Gander (1778), which gained great popularity not just in the English beau monde but even at Versailles, where Horace Walpole noted that Ellis was \\"a favourite\\". He went on to contribute to the anti-Pitt satirical work, The Rolliad (1784‚Äì85).Johnston p. 148  Sugar estates in Jamaica  When his father, also named George, died young, the slave estates of the young George Ellis were run by his paternal uncle John Ellis. However, George would later complain to his maternal uncle, Edward Long, about John's avarice. George favoured leasing the Caymanas Park plantation, but John insisted \\"upon my keeping the Caymanas in my own hands\\". In the end, John won that battle of wills.Barry Higman, Montpelier (Kingston: University of the West Indies Press, 1998), pp. 22-5. George received an income dependent on the plantation's output, which ranged from 40-80 hogsheads of sugar and 20-40 puncheons of rum. He travelled to Jamaica early in 1780, inspected his property there, contracted fever, and returned to England in late 1781. When his uncle John was lost at sea in 1782, George took control of his slave plantations in Jamaica, but did not pursue his original objective to lease Caymanas.Higman, Montpelier, p. 24.  Diplomatic and political career  In 1784, he was employed as an aide by his friend the Whig diplomat Sir James Harris (later Lord Malmesbury), with whom he travelled widely on the Continent. Taking advantage of his experience of diplomacy, he produced two prose works: Memoir of a Map of the Countries Comprehended between the Black Sea and the Caspian, published anonymously in 1788, but almost certainly by Ellis; and The History of the Dutch Revolution (1789), which had the unusual distinction of being translated into French by the future king Louis XVIII. In 1793, Malmesbury turned Tory and entered Pitt's government, and Ellis followed him, becoming a close friend of the rising young politician George Canning. Ellis was elected in 1796 as an MP for both Westbury and Seaford, and chose to sit for Seaford. However, he is not known to have spoken in the House of Commons. In 1796 and 1797, he assisted Malmesbury in peace negotiations with France. On his return to England, he joined Canning and William Gifford in founding the Tory newspaper The Anti-Jacobin, and was a frequent contributor of satirical pieces to it. In 1801 he married Anne, daughter of Admiral Sir Peter Parker, but they had no children. In the general election of the following year, he declined to stand, perhaps because of increasing ill- health, and he never again stood for Parliament.  Literary scholarship  Ellis's first work of literary antiquarianism was his Specimens of the Early English Poets (1790). In its first edition this anthology only included lyric poems dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, in modern spelling, with historical and biographical notes. The second edition, published in 1801, was expanded from one volume to three, and extended the chronological range so as to include the Anglo-Saxon poem \\"The Battle of Brunanburh\\", \\"The Land of Cockayne\\" from 14th-century Ireland, substantial extracts from The Squire of Low Degree and Layamon's Brut, and other poems in Middle English and Middle Scots. It had a lengthy historical introduction, largely based on Thomas Warton's History of English Poetry and Thomas Tyrwhitt's edition of The Canterbury Tales, but written in a more lively and readable style. The Poets proved to be a popular work, going through six editions between 1790 and 1851, and on the strength of it Ellis was hailed in 1804 in the Critical Review as \\"the hope of poetic archaeology\\".Johnston pp. 149‚Äì152 His format was imitated by several writers connected with the Lake School. Robert Southey intended his Specimens of the Later English Poets, with Preliminary Notices (1807) as a sequel to Ellis's work, and it was followed by George Burnett's Specimens of English Prose-Writers, from the Earliest Times to the Close of the Seventeenth Century, with Sketches Biographical and Literary (1807), and Charles Lamb's Specimens of English Dramatic Poets, Who Lived about the Time of Shakspeare: With Notes (1808), all under the imprint of Ellis's publisher, Longman. His second project, a collaboration with Gregory Lewis Way, was an edition of a number of 12th- and 13th-century French fabliaux, taken from the collection edited by Pierre Jean Baptiste Legrand d'Aussy. Ellis provided the preface, notes and appendix, Way the translations, and woodcuts were commissioned from Thomas Bewick and other engravers. Ellis's contribution was later praised in The Gentleman's Magazine as including \\"some of the purest and most classical passages of Addisonian composition which this age has produced\\". The two volumes of Fabliaux, or Tales were published in 1796 and 1800, and a three- volume edition, with corrections, appeared in 1815. Ellis was a natural collaborator, but some of his ventures around this time did not reach completion. He worked on a glossary to accompany a proposed edition of the Middle English romance King Alisaunder by his friend Thomas Park, but Park eventually abandoned the idea. He also encouraged William Owen Pughe in his translation of the Mabinogion, began to learn Welsh, and proposed to write a preface. In the event, the translation only ever appeared incomplete in various periodicals, and no preface was called for.Johnston pp. 155‚Äì159 Ellis provided Joseph Ritson with a verse translation of the \\"Lament for the Death of Simon of Montfort\\", though this did not appear until after both their deaths, in Ritson's Ancient Songs and Ballads (1829); he also pulled strings to ensure Ritson's Ancient Engleish Metrical Romance√´s (1802) was published. He had better success in his Specimens of Early English Metrical Romances (1805), which presented a selection of Middle English romances, not in full editions but in the form of abstracts with numerous extracts. In this way he produced a work calculated to appeal to the reading public at large rather than to antiquarian specialists. Ellis included versions of eighteen Middle English romances, including the Stanzaic Morte Arthur, Guy of Warwick, Beves of Hamtoun, Sir Isumbras, Sir Eglamour of Artois and Amis and Amiloun, as well as eight of the Anglo-Norman Lais of Marie de France and the Latin Historia Regum Britanniae and Vita Merlini of Geoffrey of Monmouth. He arranged his romances by the cycle to which they belonged, and non-cyclical works by what he conceived to be the national origin of their subject-matter, thus anticipating the practice of many more recent literary historians. His texts were taken from inedited manuscripts and early prints, mostly provided for him by the bibliophile Francis Douce and by a new friend, the poet Walter Scott. Scott was preparing his own edition of the Middle English Sir Tristrem, and the two antiquaries exchanged a stream of enthusiastic letters, helping each other through the difficulties of their researches.Johnston pp. 155, 159‚Äì174 Ellis explained to Scott his preference for readability over scholarly rigour thus: > A library is like a butcher's shop: it contains plenty of meat, but it is > all raw; no person living ... can find a meal in it, till some good cook > (suppose yourself) comes in and says, \\"Sir, I see by your looks that you are > hungry; I know your taste ‚Äì be patient for a moment, and you shall be > satisfied that you have an excellent appetite.\\" Ellis's work was published in three volumes in 1805, with a second edition in 1811, and a third in 1848. James Orchard Halliwell later wrote that > It is, indeed, difficult to estimate too highly the services which Ellis > rendered to literature by the publication of this work. The interminable > ballad romances of the middle ages had daunted all but the few initiated; > but then, as if by magic, they became the friends and companions of > thousands. Ellis, in fact, did for ancient romance what Percy had previously > accomplished for early poetry. Scott reviewed the Romances favourably, commenting on their wit and elegance, and Ellis responded by praising The Lady of the Lake in the Quarterly Review, though he was more critical of The Lord of the Isles there.Johnston p. 174Oman p. 161 Scott wrote two cantos of Marmion at Ellis's home, 'The Cedars' at Sunninghill, on the edge of Windsor Great Park, and dedicated one of them to him, calling Ellis \\"My guide, my pattern, and my friend\\", and addressing him, > Thou, who can give to lightest lay, > An unpedantic moral gay, > Nor less the dullest theme bid flit, > On wings of unexpected wit; > In letters as in life approved, > Example honoured, and belovedGawthrop p. 1  Death and legacy  George Ellis died on 10 April 1815.Oman p. 193 George and his wife Anne did not have any surviving children, and his Jamaican sugar estates and slaves passed to his cousin Charles Ellis, 1st Baron Seaford, the son of his uncle John Ellis.Higman, Montpelier, p. 24. In his journal Scott ranked Ellis first among all the conversers he had ever known, but his undoubted social graces did not charm everyone. Robert Southey thought Ellis had \\"a little too much of the air of high life, a little too much of the conversationist ... and something in his manners which showed, or seemed to show, that it was a condescension in him to be a man of letters.\\" The bibliographer Samuel Egerton Brydges' memories of him were of \\"an elegant versifier and writer, but not deep; he was a man of the world,‚Äì of very polished manners,‚Äì but a coxcomb and a petit ma√Ætre\\".

Signed to independent label, Black Cloud Music, King is also known for his productions credits with artists such as Murs, Noa James, Top Dawg Entertainment recording artist Ab-Soul, Glasses Malone, Mack 10 and more. Biography=1985‚Äì2002: Early life and career beginnings Curtiss King was born on January 23, 1985 in Bellflower, CA. King grew up as a shy child, particularly while attending Curtiss Middle school, he found ways to combat his insecurities by listening to music and getting lost in 90s sitcoms; giving him his stage name Curtiss King. From the beginning, with the help of a high school friend, YouTube, and a library card, Curtiss King set out to teach himself how to produce, engineer and write his own records, edit his own videos, design his own album covers, script his own websites, and build his brand from the ground up.Featured Musician: Curtiss King 2003‚Äì2008: Notorious Scholars and The Storm On Mars Shortly after graduating High School in 2003, Curtiss began creating and circulating numerous mixtapes to his Cerritos college classmates. After joining Myspace in 2005, he began to gain local popularity for his self pressed projects. In 2007 his production demand got a huge boost when he got a placement on the Vans Downtown Showdown Skate DVD as well as TDE artist Ab-Soul‚Äôs first project Longterm with the song ‚ÄúWatch Yo Lady\\" ft. K-Dot (Kendrick Lamar). Later that same year Curtiss King signed to Rocstarr Entertainment, an up-and-coming independent label run by producer Tae Beast and producer/engineer/songwriter Starr Lab based out of Inglewood. Under the imprint he released two well received street albums Notorious Scholars and The Storm On Mars which boasted features from Ab-Soul and Young Rook as well as production from Tae Beast. After a few years Curtiss and Rocstarr Entertainment parted ways, and once again he found himself having to grind it out alone.Unsigned Hype: Curtiss King While working a part-time job, King soon began to attend Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa where he eventually earned his Entry Level Marketing Certificate. Shortly after his collegiate accomplishments, he lost both of his grandparents to Cancer. Seeking a brand new start, Curtiss eventually moved to the Inland Empire with his mother. From spitting acapellas at local poetry venues to entering beat contests, he made it a point to engage himself in this vibrant music scene. 2009‚Äì 2010: Black Cloud Music, Snick @ Nite and Jet Pack On E In 2009, he saw his fanbase and production demand skyrocketed after collaborating with and producing for highly acclaimed artist Noa James on his Sounds of A Monster and Ab-Soul‚Äôs Longterm 2.

Throughout the 1450s, he served as an envoy from the Habsburg emperor Frederick III and his brother Archduke Albert VI of Austria to the court of Pope Nicholas V in Rome. He repeatedly tried to alleviate the ongoing fratricidal conflict between the Habsburg rulers, though to no avail. In March 1459, the emperor sent him to Siena to congratulate Pope Pius II on his recent election to the papacy. In November, he intervened in the Council of Mantua. In the conflict of Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, Prince-Bishop of Brixen with Archduke Siegmund of Austria-Tyrol, he likewise sided with the Habsburg dynasty. In the secret consistory celebrated in Siena on March 5, 1460, Pope Pius II made him a cardinal. His appointment as a cardinal was announced in the consistory held in Viterbo on May 31, 1462, and he received the titular church of Santi Nereo e Achilleo at that time. He did not participate in the papal conclave of 1464 that elected Pope Paul II. On November 16, 1461, the cathedral chapter of Salzburg Cathedral unanimously selected him as the new Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Pope Pius II confirmed his election on January 15, 1462 and sent the pallium on January 18, 1462. Weisbriach took possession of the archbishopric on January 23, 1462. He was consecrated as a bishop by Ulrich Plankenfels, Bishop of Chiemsee, on May 9, 1462. Burkhard turned out to be a strong proponent of nepotism granting several governmental offices to his relatives. In summer 1462, he sparked a tax revolt in the Archbishopric after he had quadrupled rents in some areas. The violence was most pronounced in the Pongau, Pinzgau, and Brixental. The dispute was eventually settled through the mediation of Duke Louis IX of Bavaria. The cardinal had Hohensalzburg Castle and the Salzburg town fortifications significantly enlarged. In 1465, he founded an Augustinian collegiate church in M√ºlln. He died in Salzburg on February 16, 1466. He is buried in Salzburg Cathedral.

Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows News May 9, 2017. He represents the electoral district of Maple Ridge- Mission as a member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party caucus. D'Eith is also a pianist, author and part-time music lawyer.  Personal life  D'Eith was born September 24, 1964 in British Hong Kong. He immigrated with his father John D'Eathe and mother Vanessa Tancock (n√©e Stelle-Perkins) to Canada in 1968 and was naturalized as a Canadian citizen in 1972. He has three siblings. D'Eith grew up in West Vancouver, British Columbia and attended West Bay Elementary, Cypress Park Elementary, Pauline Johnson Elementary, Irwin Park Elementary, Hillside Secondary, and Carson Graham Secondary graduating in 1982. After high school, he attended the University of Victoria earning degrees in History (B.A. Hons 1986) and in Law (J.D. 1989). D'Eith was married to Nicolette Maxwell (n√©e Langezaal) for 11 years and had three sons with her. He married Kim D'Eith (n√©e Kosaba) on July 31, 2010 (at the Kosaba Lake House, Stump Lake BC) and has two step-daughters.  Career  After articling at Swinton & Company and being called to the bar in 1990, D'Eith worked as in- house counsel for his father at Freehold Developments. He was project manager, building a strip mall in Calgary as part of Douglasdale Estates. After the real estate project, he started his own private practice primarily in real estate and entertainment law. At the same time, D'Eith was pursuing a career in music. In the late 1990s, he worked briefly for Sanguinetti, Braidwood Law in Squamish BC and then as counsel at Bardel Animation. In 2001, D'Eith became the executive director of the British Columbia music association Music BC. and restricted his practice to part-time. He now practices solely as a music lawyer. He also began a label and consulting company Adagio Music. As executive director, Bob has grown Music BC to a dominant force for the music industry in BC. D'Eith was the chair of the 2009 Vancouver JUNO Awards host committee and developed the very successful $5.2 million Peak Performance Project with the Pattison Broadcast Group. On May 1, 2013, he published his first eBook entitled, A Career in Music: the other 12 step program. The book is focused on developing indie artists and new professionals in music. On Feb 14, 2014, D'Eith published his first novel The Displaced.  Music career  D'Eith trained as a classical and jazz pianist while growing up. He played in a number of semi-professional bands until finishing law school. Once he returned to Vancouver, he joined a band called The Watchmen with lead singer Jimmy Gilmore (subsequently a member of the Silencers in Scotland) and Rob Lulic (guitar). After Jimmy left for Scotland, D'Eith, Alex Dias and Rob Lulic continued to build on the band and this core eventually became Rymes with Orange; singers Lyndon Johnson and Nelson Sinclair joined the band. The band recorded its first album Peel (1992 mixed by Bill Buckingham) and had a number of successful radio and MuchMusic videos. After touring Canada a number of times, D'Eith was forced to choose between a career on the road or a life on the business side of music. He moved back to co-managing the band with Peter Karroll and became a non-touring member of the band. The band added Steve Hennessy and Niko Quintal and recorded their second album Trapped in a Machine (1994 - produced by John Webster and recorded at Turtle Recording in Richmond, BC). This record resulted in a number of Top 30 radio hits including \\"Toy Train\\" which was undoubtedly the band's biggest hit. The song was featured in the Labatt's commercial Genuine Kelly. During this period, D'Eith was honoured with a Best keyboardist nomination at Canadian Music Week and the band was nominated for a Juno Award for Best New Artist. After a split from Rymes with Orange, D'Eith decided to re-focus his music creation. After years of urging from his father, he teamed up with his brother Paul's best friend from school Paul Schmidt. Schmidt is a classically trained guitar player. The idea was to create music which was not meant for commercial radio. It was originally an attempt to write music which would be suitable for film and television and showcase D'Eith and Schmidt's composing ability. The project took on a life of its own and the group Mythos was born. The first release was an EP called Introspection (1995). The music can be described as ambient, instrumental music featuring beats, piano, guitar, vocalese, and various other organic and synthetic elements. It is a mixture of world, electronic, dance, classical, and jazz. Generally Mythos does not use lyrics. The remix of the piece \\"November\\" became commercially successful on radio. This led to an increase CD sales and eventually awards with a Western Canadian Music Awards (WCMA) (best dance) and a Juno Award nomination (best instrumental). Canadian success and a trip to MIDEM in France led to a deal with Bay Area indie label XDOT25 which released the EP in the USA. Mehdi Amadi from XDOT 25 was working on a deal with Higher Octave, a Malibu California New Age label that agreed to pick up Mythos. Higher Octave then released a combination of Introspection and a follow up unreleased EP Iridescence (1996) with the world release of Mythos (1998) through Virgin/EMI. Mythos became a big seller for Higher Octave who went on to release the follow-up albums Reality of a Dreamer (2000) and Eternity (2002).https://www.amazon.com/Mythos/dp/B00000DCIT Sales would surpass 100,000 and Mythos stayed on the Billboard New Age charts for many months. The album's artwork was licensed from Gil Bruvel. Mythos subsequently released the album Purity (2006) with Pacific Music/Warner in Canada and Allegro/Alula records in the USA. Since that time, the pair Paul have continued to write, but with Schmidt living in Korea, recording has been a challenge. After a six-year hiatus, Mythos released a new Album entitled Journey in April 2013.

The city of Tartu contributed 10,000 krooni a year to the Kullman swimming pool where K√µrkjas trained to rent it out for use by children and disabled swimmers, but shortly before the start of the Paralympics, they discontinued funding as the pool requested an increase to 50,000 krooni a year for continued use of the pool.

Biography He was the youngest of seven children born to middle-class parents in Diecimo (now within the comune of Borgo a Mozzano) in the Republic of Lucca. From childhood, he sought solitude and wished to dedicate himself to prayer and meditation. At age 17, he began his ten-year study to become a certified pharmacist's assistant in Lucca. Afterward, he studied for the priesthood and was ordained in 1572. He first dedicated himself to the Christian formation of adolescents in his local Lucca parish. He also gathered a group of laymen around him to work in hospitals and prisons. In 1574 he founded a group charged to deepen Christian faith and devotion; this foundation occurred as part of the movement known as the Counter-Reformation. Leonardi worked with this group to spread devotion to the Blessed Mother and devotion to the Forty Hours as well as spreading the message of the importance of frequent reception of the Eucharist. He became interested in the reforms instituted by the Council of Trent, and he proposed a new congregation of secular priests to convert sinners and to restore Church discipline. In 1583, his association, which became known as the Lucca Fathers, was recognized by the bishop of Lucca with the approval of Pope Gregory XIII. In 1595, his congregation was confirmed by Pope Clement VIII. He assumed the name of \\"Giovanni of the Mother of God\\" as his religious name. This foundation received approval from Pope Paul V on January 14, 1614. The pope, encouraged by the cardinal protector Giustiniani issued a papal decree approving the union of the Lucca Fathers with the Piarists of St. Joseph Calasanz. This union would last only until the beginning of 1617 when Paul V issued another decree making the Piarists their own separate congregation. Civic leaders in Lucca opposed the establishment of a new religious order and acted to stop its formation. While ultimately ineffective, their efforts forced John Leonardi to spend most of the remainder of his life outside Lucca, with special exceptions granted by its government under the influence of the pope. Leonardi took his work to Rome where he became friends with Philip Neri. Neri became his spiritual director and held him in high regard for his qualities of firmness and judgment and entrusted him with delicate works such as the reform of the monks of Vallambrosa and the Benedictine congregation of Montevergine. In 1603, he founded along with Cardinal J. Viv√®s, the seminary of the Propagation of the Faith for the philosophical and theological training of missionary priests. In 1621, his community would formally be designated Clerks Regular of the Mother of God. The final Rule of his institute was published in 1851. Two houses of the Clerks Regular of the Mother of God were opened when he died and three others were opened during the seventeenth century. He died on October 9, 1609, from the great plague, which he contracted while ministering to his brothers suffering from the influenza epidemic that was raging in Rome at the time. He was venerated for his miracles and his religious fervor. His memory was held so high in the Holy City that Pope Leo XIII had his name placed in the Roman Martyrology and ordered the Roman clergy to celebrate his Mass and Office, an honor which is otherwise strictly limited to beatified popes. Leonardi was beatified in 1861 and canonized in 1938 by Pope Pius XI. His liturgical feast is celebrated on 9 October. His relics lie enshrined in Santa Maria in Campitelli, Rome.

The show launched in March 2011 is an extension of the various travel projects he does while on the road. Background The podcast began production in 2009 under Rhodes self- titled production company. Unlike other podcasts, Rhodes has years of experience as a host: as the first spokesman for Comedy Central in the 90s, a late night talk show host for Kevin Masters Show starring Tom Rhodes in Amsterdam in the early 2000s, a travel host for Yorin Travel, later RTL Travel, and in self-produced travel DVDs Rhode Scholar, which as filmed worldwide at comedy venues and tourist sites,) and Built for Joy. These DVDs feature clips of his performances as well as interviews with interesting locals. Rhodes, a travel blogger for The Huffington Post, has gone on record saying he would like to star in a comedy travel television show where he can document his personal travels and highlight comedy scenes around the world. Tom produced pilot episodes himself in 2010, filming in Montana and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Since 2009, Rhodes' projects have all incorporated his love of traveling and filming in exotic locales, including a \\"Honeymoon World Tour\\" after he married Dutch photographer Ashna Rodjan in 2011. He and his wife filmed during this time, and documented his travels on his blog. Like fellow comic Louis C.K., Rhodes does self-production of his podcast and his projects. He presents them on his YouTube page. His messages are often political, but are overall amiable. The tagline for the show is \\"promoting love and laughter in the universe,\\" which is fitting for Rhodes' hippie-style and San Francisco roots. His podcast and travel DVDs can easily be seen as labors of love due to the lack of monetary gain for himself and his own money spent on production. Reception Most episodes have featured interviews with comics Tom knew in his early stand-up years, such as Doug Stanhope and Brian Regan. Stanhope is known for his comedic cynicism and called Tom a \\"very positive person\\" on the first episode of the show. Janeane Garofalo, also a cynical comic, was quoted in a documentary about Tom's career as saying that Rhodes' laid-back persona would normally \\"rub her the wrong way,\\" but since Rhodes is upbeat both on and off stage, she enjoys him. Matador Network, a travel culture website, listed TRR as one of the top podcasts of 2011 due to its humor and diverse guests.

It has the mission to prepare professors capable of developing high level professionals in different areas of engineering. It works to become the national leader of scientific and technical-pedagogical excellence for the improvement of the Technical and Professional Education and for its leading role of the technical careers in the rest of the pedagogical institutions.  History The creation of the university has its origin in a project of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) requested by Cuban Government. It was originally named Higher Technical Pedagogical Institute of Technical Education (ISPET) and it was installed in the Center of Students of Agricultural Sciences (CEDCA), in the municipality of Boyeros. This project was included in the United Nations Development Program (PNUD) with the specification CUB 71-511. It began in the 1972-1973 academic year with an emerging training course. It is officially created in the course 1973-1974. In the academic year 1976-1977 with the network of Pedagogical Institutes of the MINED, the center becomes the ISPETP and works with the Faculties of: Technology, Agricultural Sciences and Economic Sciences. The licentiate degree of all the specialties was imparted in the present Superior School of Management of the Industry Ministry and in some places of the Polytechnic \\"Jos√© Mart√≠\\". In 1979 the Faculty of Mechanics was approved. From 1986 the ISPETP was made with students graduated from the related specialties and is assigned the name of H√©ctor Alfredo Pineda Zald√≠var, outstanding educator of the center that lost his life in the fulfillment of his professional duty. In 1987, the creation of the Center's Scientific Council was approved. In 1991 arises the Center of Studies for Technical and Professional Pedagogy (CEPROF). From 1992-1993 the faculties merged in: * Industrial Faculty. * Faculty of Agricultural and Economic Sciences. Due to the economic difficulties, faculties were created in Pedagogical Institutes in the rest of the country and the students were transferred to each of their provinces of origin. The Institute now leads the Technical Education in the country, being responsible for the work of scientific and methodological advice. Today the institution carries out an intense academic work that extends in and out of our geographical borders, forming and training hundreds of professionals of the teaching in Professional Pedagogy. Organization At present, the faculties are arranged as follows: * Faculty of Mechanical Engineering * Faculty of Electrical Engineering * Faculty of Accounting * Faculty of Agricultural Engineering * Faculty of Computer Sciences * Faculty of Civil Engineering Names and confusion  This University of Pedagogical Sciences is named after one of its professors: H√©ctor Alfredo Pineda Zald√≠var, who fell in unequal combat in the Zumbe region, in the People's Republic of Angola where he collaborated as a teacher. The person after whom ISPETP is named is unknown to the outside world. It was originally named Higher Technical Pedagogical Institute of Technical Education (ISPET). In the academic year 1976-1977 the name changed to Instituto Superior Pedagogico para la Ensenanza Tecnica y Profesional \\"Hector Pineda Zaldivar\\" (ISPETP) to reflect the evolution from Technical to Technical and Professional education. Sometimes, ISPETP is written as University of Pedagogical Sciences () in some English literature, such as journals, etc. It is still known as ISPETP, due to the popularity and easy pronunciation of that short name.

While the formal purpose of the Templeton Colony and its Rhode Island counterpart was to train young people with disabilities in the application of farm work and mechanical trades, the institutions' forefather, Dr. Walter Fernald, was a famous eugenicist whose doctrine was to remove the feeble-minded from society in an effort to cleanse the nation's population of inferior and \\"defective\\" genes. This ideology would come to define the purpose of the school. Dr. Fernald's prot√©g√© and chief administrator of the Templeton Colony, Dr. Joseph Ladd, was the school's first superintendent. An accomplished physician and classically educated pedagogue, his administration of the institution during its early development was considered by many to be a noteworthy contributor to the state's public welfare. However, as the years wore on, his reputation for mistreatment of the students grew. In 1916 he changed the name of the institution to Exeter SchoolLadd , M.D., Joseph H. (1916) Report of the Exeter School to the RI Board of Education, p.20 in order to abate public disapproval of the term ‚Äòfeeble-minded,‚Äô and by the 1920s, the institution's entire character and purpose had become altogether something different.  The Exeter School = 1920s - 1940s  The school was criticized for overcrowding and inadequate care. It was described as a \\"dumping ground\\" and said that officials there had a \\"fatalistic attitude\\" with little effort being made toward deinstitutionalization. During the middle of the first half of the 20th century, the Exeter School did little to educate or train its growing population. To alleviate overcrowding, the school building was used mainly as living quarters for young children and wayward girls, while the dormitories were filled well beyond capacity. Adopting a purpose more characteristic of a custodial or penal institution, the Exeter School's policy became focused primarily on detaining people indefinitely as a means of segregating them from free society. This burgeoning practice was enacted upon individuals who committed petty crimes, or, in many cases, no crimes at all, especially toward women accused of immoral practices such as prostitution, sodomy, extramarital intercourse, and ‚Äòillegitimate‚Äô pregnancy. A court commitment to Exeter was leveraged in countless cases as a means of eliminating the bloodline of entire families. Because compulsory sterilization was illegal in Rhode Island, most women sentenced under such pretenses were confined to Exeter until menopause or natural death, while a select few were sterilized nevertheless by willing surgeons who found ways to circumvent the law. In this way, until the end of World War II, the Exeter School's foremost function was that of a eugenics-era segregation facility.  1940s - 1950s  After decades of severe overcrowding, diminishing finances, and worsening living conditions, Dr. Ladd's administration of the Exeter School underwent a paradigm shift. Taking a stand against state government executors, in 1947, he discharged nearly one third of the Exeter School's population, then more than 900, attributing his decision to the institution's impending financial failure.Ladd, M.D., Joseph H. (1945) Report of the Exeter School to the Department of Social Welfare, p.2 Though effective in increasing financial support from the state, disavowing the Exeter School's role as a custodial institution for the immoral and criminally-inclined ‚Äúdefective delinquents‚Äù would prove impossible to achieve absolutely. Over the course of the following decade, the institution continued to expand, constructing more buildings and fostering a growing population, with an increased emphasis on institutionalizing those with severe disabilities. Living conditions hardly improved. With a larger population of younger and more severely disabled inmates, the Exeter School's shortage of qualified care-givers grew more acute. As supervision became increasingly difficult, the infirm and helpless languished, and a new generation of defective delinquents grew bolder. In 1955, the situation finally reached a head when a 20-year-old inmate - a lifelong state ward and court-committed defective delinquent - was implicated in the murder of a severely disabled child. The scandal signaled the end of an era, prompting Dr. Ladd's swift resignation. After almost a half century of service to the state, his resignation speech was bitter-sweet, with scarcely a glimmer of sentimentality.  The Dr. Joseph H. Ladd School = 1950s - 1970s  In 1956, Dr. John Smith, former director of education at the Connecticut Training School for the Feeble-Minded, was chosen as Dr. Ladd's successor, and, in a bid to again improve the institution's image, the Exeter School was renamed the Dr. Joseph H. Ladd School in 1958. With renewed enthusiasm, the institution underwent another series of growth spurts in subsequent years, bringing about the establishment of a new, modern school building, a state-of- the-art hospital, and a cluster of single-story cottages that would one day prove models of the modern group home. Though aggressive public relations campaigns were routinely waged on television and in newspapers, Dr. Smith's administration throughout the 1960s and early 1970s was not without its share of troubles. Citizen-run advocacy groups began to take form, and employees took to the street picketing for higher wages and improved working conditions, while fierce bureaucratic conflicts erupted behind closed doors as Dr. Smith's political opponents tried time and again to oust him from office for mismanaging funds and abusing his executive authority. The influence of the Doctor's constituents, however, would prove more powerful than that of his critics; and for twenty years his administration persevered.  1970s - 1994  In November 1977, scandal erupted again when a State-appointed investigation into conditions at the Ladd School's hospital building reported an assortment of disturbing health violations at the dental clinic. The report was leaked to newspapers, and, in the days and weeks following, investigative journalists proceeded to uncover and report a multitude of health and human rights violations, including several patient deaths due to negligence and medical malpractice. The resulting onslaught of legal inquisition in the face of damning evidence would finally prove to be more than Smith's predominance could combat; in January, 1978, Governor J. Joseph Garrahy fired the doctor from office, and another era came to a close. Though still not free of its troubles, the Ladd School's countenance in the 1980s was remarkably more tame than in any other decade. The dust had finally settled on a class action lawsuit filed against the State of Rhode Island after the dental scandal of 1977, ending with a court ruling that the institution adopt a wholesale revision of its policies and practices and reduce its population by half. Overseen by the institution's third and final appointed executive director, George Gunther, the institution's population continued to dwindle as the effort to reform the Ladd School gave rise to a number of public and private agencies for community care of the developmentally disabled. Over time, the deinstitutionalization movement gained enough momentum that in 1986, Governor Edward D. DiPrete announced the closing of the Ladd School. In 1993, the last few residents were relocated to alternative care facilities, and the institution closed down for good. The 2015 supernatural thriller Exeter (released in the UK as The Asylum) was filmed on location at the abandoned Ladd School prior to the final four buildings being demolished in August 2013. The film's premise depicts a fictionalized attempt to renovate the property and partially details some of the real Ladd School's history.

SUGAR Volt  Boeing SUGAR Volt concept aircraft SUGAR Volt is a hybrid aircraft concept proposed by a team led by Boeing's Research & Technology division. It is one of a series of concepts put forward in response to a request for proposals for future aircraft issued by NASA. It is proposed that SUGAR Volt would use two hybrid turbofans that burn conventional jet fuel when taking off, then use electric motors to power the engines while flying. SUGAR stands for Subsonic Ultragreen Aircraft Research, the \\"volt\\" part of the \\"SUGAR Volt\\" name suggests that it would be at least partly powered by electricity. SUGAR Volt would have emissions about 70 percent lower than average airliners today. Noise pollution will also be lower than airliners today. This hybrid-electric approach however remains to be balanced against increased complexity, large electric engine and battery size and weight. Relying partly on electric power might reduce specific fuel consumption (SFC) compared to a standard turbine- only design (turbofan or lower-consumption turboprops). SUGAR Volt is designed with a long, braced, high aspect ratio wing that decreases induced drag due to lift. The wings of SUGAR Volt would enable it to take off in a shorter distance and generate less noise. The outer wings of the SUGAR Volt should fold to save ground space, increasing weight.  Transonic Truss-Braced Wing  By early 2019, following extensive wind tunnel testing at NASA Ames Research Center, an optimized truss and more sweep for the span wing allowed flying higher and faster, up from Mach 0.70‚Äì0.75 to Mach 0.80 like current jetliners. Compared to aircraft with cantilevered wings, fuel burn should be reduced by 8-10%, and the technology should be ready in 2030-2035. Aspect ratios up to 27 were evaluated, up from 8-10 for current narrowbodies. The design was presented at the January 2019 AIAA conference and the wing folds outboard of the truss to use airport gates for the -span 737. (ICAO aerodrome code C) The wing has 20¬∞ of sweep and came forward, the truss was optimised, tapered with an increased root chord, has a trailing edge with forward sweep and generates lift. It should be tested from early 2019 at the NASA Ames transonic tunnel, then later in 2019 at the subsonic tunnel at NASA Langley. A full-scale X-plane could be developed and tested under NASA‚Äôs UEST plan, outlined in the New Aviation Horizons flight demonstration from 2023. Boeing proposed to modify an MD-80 powered by turbofans, but it could test a series/parallel hybrid electric propulsor based on Rolls-Royce LibertyWorks‚Äô EVE concept of a geared turbofan. An electric motor/generator mounted between the compressor and the variable pitch fan, fed by batteries to boost the takeoff and climb, allows for a smaller engine and improves efficiency by 4.5% over a mission. A tail-mounted BLI fan would ingest and reenergize the slow airflow over the fuselage.

The fire was reported as a smoke column early on the area early in the morning on June 9, 2012. The area had been suffering from hot and dry conditions and fire danger was extreme. Multiple agencies responded for initial attack, including http://www.rcvfd.org Rist Canyon Volunteer Fire Department (the fire started in RCVFD's area), Larimer County Emergency Services, Poudre Fire Authority, Poudre Canyon Fire Protection District, Colorado State Forest Service, USFS and other local agencies. A SEAT (Single Engine Air Tanker) and Helicopter were ordered immediately. The ignition point and foot of the fire was accessible only via 4wd road that would support apparatus no larger than Type 6x NWCG Engine Standards. The fire was named High Park as this is the local name for the area it burned. Due to extreme burning conditions, poor access and rapid fire-spread, it became rapidly clear the fire would impact multiple residential areas and evacuations were called for an increasing area through the day. Areas evacuated include: Buckhorn Canyon, Paradise Parke, Stove Prairie, Flower Road, Rist Canyon, Paradise Park, Poudre Park, Poudre Canyon, Davis Ranch, Whale Rock, Pine Acres and areas included. The evacuation lasted nearly 21 days - much longer than other large Colorado fires. Evacuation was conducted via reverse 911 calls then door to door visits by Fire Department and Law Enforcement. Due to the fact that the area is served by overhead power and phone lines, power and phone were lost very rapidly. Furthermore, the area is not served by cellular service. These factors, plus damage to infrastructure were key limiters in re-patriation. Residents would be returning to very dangerous conditions and with no effective communications. High Park Fire, unlike others, burned very actively and with high intensity for days. This fire did not burn through and settle down, but continued to burn actively. Two weeks into the fire it was still burning so aggressively that over 50 homes were lost as the fire burned into a subdivision north of the Poudre River. This was despite days of preparatory efforts - demonstrating the power of fire in the wildland/urban interface. While loss of so many homes in the High Park fire is certainly a tragic loss, response to the High Park fire is recognized as a model good response. Agencies in the area have a long cooperative history with established and recognized ability to work together to a common goal regardless of agency boundaries. Fire and local agency response was effective and well coordinated. Furthermore, years (decades) of active work with residents to prepare for fire was effective. Many houses survived due to efforts made by landowners that allowed the home to survive the fire front and gave fire fighters the benefit of time in defending and saving structures. That said, it was a daily battle to same home for some weeks. Critical to that success was the thorough mapping and preparation done by local fire departments which allowed incoming fire fighters to be more effective, more rapidly. However, further work on making homes in the urban interface ignition resistant is needed. This was a major topic at the NFPA Backyards and Beyond conference held in Salt Lake City in 2013. Impact of 2013 Floods One of the key factors that residents must be prepared for after a major fire is flooding. According to the High Park Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) Report the High Park area could expect water flows in streams to be 5 to 10x pre fire levels for any given rainfall. Also predicted was major flooding in the case of a significant rain event. For this reason, residents in High Park as well as Larimer County prepared extensively for flooding. Larimer County upgraded culverts in the Rist Canyon to heavy concrete structures with concrete debris wings that would prevent debris capture and subsequent blockage of the culverts. As predicted, during the spring and summer of 2013 Rist Canyon Road, Stove Prairie Road and Buckhorn Canyon Road, as well as the Poudre Canyon, experienced multiple flood events. However, due to the preparation, the impact of the events were minimized. This culminated in the major rain/flood event of September 2013 when, over the period of just a couple of days, the front range of Colorado received extremely heavy and persistent rain. Rain gages in Rist Canyon recorded over 15\\" of rain. Due to the extra preparation post High Park, the Rist Canyon Road remained relatively intact. While many of the new culvert structures overtopped (as designed), they did not plug or fail and the road remained. Neighboring roads that had not received the same preparation were destroyed. For example, the Buckhorn Canyon Road - used to access the High Park Ignition point - was destroyed. Helicopter flights after the flood showed that, in many places, all signs of the road were gone. Ultimately - due to the flood preparations by residents and agencies after High Park, that area weathered the floods of 2013 relatively well. By December 2013 all major roads in the area had received effective, if temporary, repairs and residents who had been cut off could now access their properties.

She has had numerous individual and collective exhibitions in Mexico, more recently working with a group of Mexican and Japanese female artists called Flor de Maguey. In 2008, she partially lost her sight due to illness, but she remains a working artist, continuing to create and exhibit her work. Life Shino Watabe was born in 1970 in Tokyo, Japan. According to Watabe, she was a lonely girl who grew up with a ‚Äúhell‚Äù in her heart. Instead of seeing things outwardly, she preferred to see them inwardly. She studied from 1985 to 1988 at the preparatory school affiliated with the Women‚Äôs University of Fine Arts. From 1987 to 1988 she studied painting and drawing at the Evening School of Fine Arts of the Yoyogi Seminary. From 1988 to 1990, she studied at the Women‚Äôs University of Fine Arts majoring in painting. In 1990, she came to Mexico City to study at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas of UNAM. She has studied under Jes√∫s Mart√≠nez, Pedro Ascencio and Gilberto Aceves Navarro. She has lived in Mexico City since coming to study, speaking Spanish fluently since shortly after her arrival. She is one of many Japanese artists who have come to Mexico because of the culture the opportunities it affords them. Watabe has no interest in returning permanently to Japan. In 2008, she partially lost her sight due to illness but still works as an artist, exhibiting individually and collectively. Career Shino Watabe and Shoko Sumi at the opening of \\"Experimentando con gatos\\" exhibition at the Garros Galer√≠a. In her early career, she participated in ten collective exhibitions in both Japan and Mexico. Individual exhibitions include Desde mi infancia at the Centro Cultural San √Ångel Mexico City (1994), Esencias visible √© invisibles at the Galer√≠a Coyoac√°n Mexico City (1995), Corrompidos at the Cafeter√≠a el Cafeciofono in Mexico City (1996), Rinc√≥n Nost√°lgico at the Parque Arturo Mundet in Mexico City (1998), Luchando por proteger la sensibilidad at the Casa de la Cultura M√©xico-Jap√≥n Mexico City (1999), La B√∫squeda de mi ser at the Cafeter√≠a El Infinito in Monterrey (2001), Venta de obras de Shino Watabe at the Casa Antigua in McAllen, Texas (2005) and Coraz√≥n de Piedra at the Museo Hist√≥rico de Reynosa in Reynosa, Tamaulipas (2006). In 2011, she had an exhibition of pieces such as violins and images of cats made with recyclable materials at the Tarragona, Bocados del Mundo restaurant in Mexico City. The materials included cardboard, egg cartons and cigarette butts. In 2012, she exhibited Experimentando con gatos at the Garros Galer√≠a. Her work was featured in 1997 in the Trabajo Social magazine published by UNAM. Watabe belongs to a group of Japanese and Mexican female artists in Mexico City called the Flor de Maguey (maguey flower) which also has sculptors Beatrix Lazo, Keiko Toda, painters Shoko Sumi and Midori Suzuki and engravers Patricia Medill√≠n and Sumi Hamano. This group regularly has exhibitions together. Flor de Maguey‚Äôs works reflect, through painting and sculpture, on the traditions, life and nature of the two countries represented in the group. In 2011, she had an exhibition with fellow member Patricia Medill√≠n called ‚ÄúPerspectivas Femininas‚Äù at the Foro Cultural Casa Hilvana in honor of International Women‚Äôs Day. Another exhibition with the entire group was ‚ÄúCuatro mujeres, cuatro perspectivas del grupo de artistas Flor de Maguey‚Äù at the Espacio Jap√≥n in Mexico City in 2012. At this exhibition, Watabe‚Äôs contribution was fifteen works related to the 2011 Japanese earthquake. Artistry Her work is mostly autobiographical, strongly influenced by figurative art. Her work still contains some Japanese aesthetic despite living in Mexico for over twenty years. Her creativity is introverted. She relates a story that when she was a child, she would take stones from the bottom of a river, which shined as they were wet. However, when she got them home, they would be dry and less attractive. She has found the same effect with words, profound as she thinks them but less important once said. It is also the reason she paint self-portraits, keeping an element of the internal. One of these was painted just after the 2011 Japan earthquake to capture her feelings about the disaster. Watabe‚Äôs works often speak of pain and melancholy, but also with an element of strength. She states her aim is that with enthusiasm and love we can continue against difficulties. However, her work has also included flowers and women who are magical and related to flowers in some way, using rich colors.

Palestinian militant Ibrahim Hasouna killed three Israelis, including a Druze police officer, and wounded 35. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade claimed responsibility for the attack. An Israeli court found Marwan Barghouti, head of Tanzim, guilty of directing this attack, and of directing other killings including the Murder of Georgios Tsibouktzakis .Marwan Barghouti Convicted of Murder Background The attack was carried out by Tanzim, and involved three operatives: Drivers Mazen Mahmoud Omar Khadi and Marad Nazmi Agloni, and shooter Ibrahim Hasouna. Under police interrogation, the drivers confessed that they had initially infiltrated Jerusalem, planning to carry out an attack in Pisgat Ze'ev, but were deterred by a heavy police presence. They then drove to Tel Aviv. Hasouna asked to be dropped off in a densely populated area, and the drivers decided to drop him off on a pedestrian bridge overlooking a number of restaurants in central Tel Aviv. The attack occurred in the early morning, at which time the Seafood market restaurant was crowded with people gathered for an Oriental music evening and a bachelorette party. The attack At 2:10 AM, Hasouna opened fire. Shooting at diners sitting near the windows with an M16 rifle, he emptied two magazines. According to eyewitness Gilli Cohen, \\"people started to push their way to the bathrooms, and there was mass hysteria\\". He also threw two fragmentation grenades at people escaping the restaurant, though they did not detonate. Hasouna then headed for the \\"Mifgash Hasteakim\\" restaurant next door, pulling out a knife and stabbing at police officers and civilians attempting to restrain him, killing a police officer, but was eventually shot dead.

He is a former student of The Kubert School and is best known for his artistic collaborations with underground comics pioneers Harvey Pekar of American Splendor fame, and Jay Lynch who illustrates Garbage Pail Kids. He has a cult following amongst minicomic fans with his series Deviant Funnies and Isolation Chamber.  Life  Piskor was fascinated by comics throughout his childhood. He was a great fan of mainstream comics such as The Amazing Spider-Man, but his interest in the alternative comics developed rapidly when, at the age of 9, he saw a documentary that had Harvey Pekar reading one of his American Splendor stories. After finishing high school, he attended the Kubert School for a year, where he met comics artists including Steve Bissette, Tom Yeates, John Totleben, and Rick Veitch. His first major comics Deviant Funnies and the autobiographical Isolation Chamber are generally marked with dark humour. In 2003 he started his collaboration with Jay Lynch, and shortly after that with Harvey Pekar. Piskor's first major task with Pekar was illustrating stories of American Splendor: Our Movie Year, which elaborates Pekar's experience after the release of the movie American Splendor. Piskor also illustrated Pekar's graphic novel Macedonia, which was released in 2007 through Villard Books. Piskor's series Wizzywig deals with Kevin \\"Boingthump\\" Phenicle, a young prodigy who becomes fascinated with social engineering, phone phreaking, and eventually computer hacking. As the series progresses, Kevin grows as well as his trials and tribulations with hacking. His endeavors make him legendary; his abilities are feared and also revered by many. The character from the series, Kevin, is a composite of many well known phreaks and hackers such as Kevin Mitnick, Kevin Poulsen, Joybubbles, and many others. Piskor's drawing has been influenced by 1960s and '70s underground comix scene, and he also points to Robert Crumb as a major influence, but comic critics have praised Piskor for developing his own artistic style. In 2009 Piskor collaborated with Pekar on the graphic book The Beats: A Graphic History. The book was published in the UK by Souvenir Press Ltd and drew plaudits from Studs Terkel: ‚ÄúThe Beats is as fresh and pertinent as the latest scholarly history, only far more entertaining.‚Äù The Beats tells the story of Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and John Clellon Holmes who became known as The Beat Generation. This cultural revolution is seen through the eyes of the movement's key figures and its minor characters including Diane di Prima, Carolyn Cassady, Philip Lamantia, and others. The startlingly original graphic non-fiction work was highly praised in Vanity Fair: ‚ÄúEditor Paul Buhle‚Äôs graphic history The Beats‚Äîwith riffs from cats such as Harvey Pekar and Trina Robbins‚Äîburns like a Roman candle.‚Äù Piskor's Eisner Award winning series, Hip Hop Family Tree, is a historical account of Hip Hop culture and the artists that have shaped the genre. Piskor has announced that he is writing a new comic for Marvel titled X-Men: Grand Design focusing on the history of the X-Men. The first issue of Grand Design was released in December 2017. Since 2018, Piskor has co-hosted Cartoonist Kayfabe, a YouTube channel focusing on 90's and independent comics, with fellow Pittsburgh native Jim Rugg.

Sakthivel is a man of high values and integrity who has a wife (Khushbu Sundar) and a son (Master Vasanthakumar) while Thangarasu is a young angry man who cannot tolerate injustice thus getting easily in trouble. The stepbrothers are both respected by the villagers but Sakthivel refuses to even acknowledge Thangarasu as his brother. Meanwhile, Manju (Manthra) and Revathi (Radhika Chaudhari) fall in love with Thangarasu. During a wedding function, some rowdies misbehave with Sakthivel's wife, Manju and Revathi. Thangarasu has no other choice than to beat them up. At the village court, Sakthivel insults Thangarasu and publicly flogs him. A heartbroken Thangarasu then blames his mother believing that she had killed his father and his grandfather (R. Sundarrajan) tells him the truth. In the past, Sathyamurthy (Vijayakanth) was a village chief with a heart of gold who helped the poor. He lived with his shrewish wife Annapoorani (Ambika) and his son Sakthivel. Annapoorni's brothers (Radharavi and Thyagu) then brainwashed her: Annapoorni's didn't want her husband to help the poor anymore and started to behave harshly towards him. Sathyamurthy slowly distanced himself from Annapoorni and secretly continued to help the poor. Soon, Annapoorni suspected Sathyamurthy of having an affair with the poor village woman Kannamma (Viji) and Annapoorni even publicly humiliated her. Kannamma then attempted to commit suicide but Sathyamurthy saved her. Sathyamurthy's mother (Manorama) advised her son to marry the innocent Kannamma. Back to the present, Thangarasu finally meets his mother Kannamma who was living all these years in a special home and he brings her to his village. There, Sakthivel insults Kannamma for killing his father Sathyamurthy. Thangarasu and Sakthivel have a fight but their grandmother stops it and tells them the truth. That day, Sathyamurthy had in fact eaten poisoned food given by Annapoorni and her brothers and the blame was put on the innocent Kannamma. Sakthivel eventually apologises to his stepbrother Thangarasu and his stepmother Kannamma. Annapoorni scolds her brothers for killing her husband but they swear that they are innocent. Sakthivel and Thangarasu finally find out the culprit: Thambidurai (Rajan P. Dev), a rich zamindar who hated Sathyamurthy for helping the poor. Sakthivel and Thangarasu beat Thambidurai and his henchmen up, and the police arrest Thambidurai for the murder of their father.

Afterwards he spent six months in the U.S. Merchant Marine and traveled to France and the Caribbean. Guided by his desire to learn Spanish (the language having attracted him since his adolescence), he lived in Cuba, where he had relatives and friends, for several seasons, studying and perfecting his Spanish. His stay in Cuba also whetted his appetite for Hispanic literature and culture. Beginning in the fall of 1945 he studied Spanish literature at Princeton University, receiving his doctorate in Spanish literature and Romance languages in 1955 with a thesis entitled \\"La gesta de las mocedades de Rodrigo: Reflections of a Lost Epic Poem in the Cronica de los Reyes de Castilla and the Cronica General de 1344\\", written under the direction of Am√©rico Castro.

He also worked closely with Hispanist Manuel da Costa Fontes on studies focusing especially on the oral traditions of Portugal and Brazil. Beginning in 1975, Sam Armistead conducted a field study on the Hispanic linguistics of Spanish colonial communities in Louisiana, communities that have existed in that state since the 18th century and still do. The book he published from that study is The Spanish Tradition in Louisiana (1992). More recently he was engaged in researching additional aspects of Louisiana Spanish and its oral literature.Anle: Academia Norteamericana de la Lengua Espa√±ola (In Spanish: Anle: North American Academy of Spanish language). Retrieved June 13, 2012. Between 2000 and 2002 he was co-chair of the Departments of Spanish and Classics at the University of California, Davis. In 2003 he published a six-volume collection of Portuguese traditional romances from the Azores Islands, and he was at work on subsequent volumes. at the time of his death. He retired in 2010 from UC Davis, as professor emeritus. Armistead died on August 7, 2013, at 85 years old, in Davis, California, due to complications from surgery.  Career  His studies were especially focused on medieval Spanish language and literature, Hispanic folk literature, comparative literature and folklore. He studied ballads of Spain and North Africa. He excelled also in his studies of minority and archaic (but still existing) languages, such as the Spanish language of the Isle√±o communities in Louisiana and, especially, the Sephardic Jews' language, Ladino. Armistead was author of a multi-volume series concerning the traditional literature of the Sephardic Jews and is author, co-author, editor, or co-editor of over twenty books and several hundred articles on medieval Spanish literature, modern Hispanic oral literature, and comparative literature. His research fields that have had special impact include early poetry, medieval history, Hispanic dialectology, the Spanish epic and Romance, old and traditional. He conducted numerous field surveys on the language and oral literature of the Sephardic communities of Morocco, the Middle East, rural communities in Portugal, Spain and Israel, and several sites in the United States. In addition, he performed pioneering studies on various genres of Hispanic oral tradition, such as the kharjas, riddles, the paremeolog√≠a and folktales.  Contributions  Samuel G. Armistead wrote more than 30 books and 500 articles. Alone or in collaboration with colleagues, Samuel G. Armistead published exemplary studies and collections of medieval Spanish literature (epic, chronicles, and lyrical jarchas primitive ballads) and its modern oral survivals, as well as studies of the Pan-Hispanic Ballad and pan-European and language, culture and literature of the Sephardic Jews and other minority communities and cultures. He also wrote studies considered indispensable on the languages and oral literature of various Hispanic linguistic groups from those located in the Canary Islands and Mexico to those in the state of Louisiana. El romancero judeo-espa√±ol en el Archivo Men√©ndez Pidal (The Judeo- Spanish ballads in the Archive Men√©ndez Pidal, 1978) has been frequently used as a reference work for all students of Sephardic ballads. Samuel G. Armistead has also carried out pioneering studies on other genres of pan-Hispanic oral literature, such as song lyrics from the Mozarabic jarchas, contemporary lyrics to these songs, riddles, folk tales, proverbs and improvised oral poetry. It has also published important studies concerned and also on traditional Arabic literature and epic French, German and Pan European. Among the more important contributions of Samuel G. Armistead to studies Hispanic literature, should be noted that nearly a score of Sephardic romances are directly and genetically linked with the Spanish, French and German epic medieval, rather than with the printed ballad¬¥s texts published in the 16th century. This has provided an extraordinary boost to reception of the theories defined as \\"traditionalist,\\" in distinction to the \\"individualist\\" theory, about the genesis and evolution of Hispanic ballads, and he has always defended their genetic dependence upon the epic. The \\"individualist\\" theory denied the link between epic and ballad and argued that the ballad was a genre created mostly by scholars of the 16th century. Another major contribution by Professor Armistead to hispanistic studies has been his continued field work and the pursuit of oral literature materials among people belonging to the lower classes and social groups and linguistically peripheral and thus marginalized within their respective cultural areas. Finally, Professor Armistead has formed many generations of Spanish scholars by means of his courses, seminars, conferences and lectures, and the influence of his prize- winning teaching has contributed greatly to the evolution and development of the school of American Hispanicists throughout the second half of the 20th century and into the 21st century.  Personal life  Armistead spent his last years in Northern California.e-Sefardi: Noticias del mundo sefardi. Samuel G.

This is also known as \\"auction fever\\".  Origins  The phenomenon of calor licitantis is believed to be as old as auctions themselves. This term was first used in the court system of Rome to describe the irrational behavior of bidders at auctions. The use of the phrase seemed to describe both the mental state of the bidder and the result of that state; specifically, that through the bidding process undertaken by one suffering from calor licitantis, the price of an item was driven above and beyond its typical or expected value.  Bidder's Heat in Antiquity  According to the Corpus Juris Civilis, the official body of Roman law, a bidder could be released from their bond to a purchase if calor licitantis had led to inflation of the price of the item in question such that the bidder could not reasonably pay to it. The passage in Corpus Juris Civilis that addresses calor lcitantis this states: Locatio vectigalium, quae calor licitantis ultra modum solitae conductionis inflavit, ita demum admittenda est, si Ô¨Ådeiussores idoneos et cautionem is qui licitatione vicerit oÔ¨Äerre paratus sit. Translated: \\"A tax lease that has been inflated beyond the usual sum due to bidding fever shall only be admitted if the winner of the auction is able to provide reliable bondsmen and securities.\\"  Modern Equivalents  Certain contemporary consumer psychologists attribute bidding-fever to the pleasure derived from winning an auction, as opposed any particular desire to own the object being sold at auction. The irrational behavior focused on the success of acquiring an object is sometimes referred to be the related terms \\"loser's curse\\" and \\"winner's curse\\".

In English, the term was most commonly used after World War II, during the denazification hearings in West Germany, to refer to people who were not charged with Nazi crimes but whose involvement with the Nazi Party was considered so significant that they could not be exonerated for the crimes of the Nazi regime. Etymology The German word Mitl√§ufer has been in common use since the 17th century. It means as much as \\"follower\\", more literally \\"tag-along\\", a person who gives in to peer pressure. A Mitl√§ufer is one who is not convinced by the ideology of the group followed but merely offers no resistance, such as for lack of courage or for opportunism. The term is usually translated in English as \\"fellow traveler\\" or \\"hanger-on\\", but it is not equivalent to either. A German dictionary provides the English translation as \\"follower\\". An English version dictionary defines it as \\"a passive follower\\". The German word Mitl√§ufereffekt is derived from it. Mitl√§ufereffekt, also called the Bandwagon-Effekt (bandwagon effect), refers to the effect a perceived success exerts on the willingness of individuals to join the expected success. For example, voters would like to be on the winning side and so prefer to choose the candidate that they expect will win.\\"Mitl√§ufereffekt\\", Wolfgang J. Koschnik, Standardw√∂rterbuch f√ºr die Sozi.alwissenschaften, Bd. 2, M√ºnchen London New York Paris 1993, . Legal definitions In the American Sector of Allied-occupied Germany, a \\"follower\\" was the fourth lowest group or category in the denazification proceedings. The denazification hearings classified Germans according to five groups: * 1. Major Offenders (German: Hauptschuldige) * 2. Offenders: Activists, Militants, or Profiteers (German: Belastete) * 3. Lesser offenders (German: Minderbelastete) * 4. Followers (German: Mitl√§ufer) * 5. Exonerated persons (German: Entlastete) In Allied-occupied Austria, the Russian term poputchik (fellow traveller) was translated into German as Mitl√§ufer, and they were considered to be \\"lesser offenders\\" (a person who, although not formally charged with participation in war crimes, was sufficiently involved with the Nazi regime to the extent that the Allied authorities could not legally exonerate them). Assessment Of the five categories Mitl√§ufer is the most controversial as it does not relate to any formal Nazi criminal activity, as defined largely ex post facto by the Nuremberg trials, only to a loosely defined indirect support of Nazi crimes. Therefore, former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt could say about Herbert von Karajan's Nazi Party membership card: \\"Karajan was obviously not a Nazi. He was a Mitl√§ufer.\\" In essence Mitl√§ufer were found de facto guilty of contributing to Nazi crimes, even though they were not ideologically committed to some essential Nazi doctrines, especially biological racism and the policy of Jewish extermination. The Nazi Mitl√§ufer often were of a slightly different sort: they sympathised with the Nazis but only indirectly participated in Nazi atrocities such as genocide. This is why this category was often used as an easy way to excuse most Germans legally from Nazi crimes. Examples In addition to von Karajan, well-known Mitl√§ufer included the philosopher Martin Heidegger and Wilhelm Stuckart, who was convicted as a Mitl√§ufer.

It can be produced from C. fusiformis from Pennisetum typhoideum. It is a precursor in the biosynthesis of D-(+)-lysergic acid. Ergot alkaloids are natural products derived from L-tryptophan. They are often toxic for humans and animals. Despite that they are also well known for their pharmacological activities. Biosynthesis The main building blocks for biosynthesis of elymoclavine are tryptophan (Trp) and DMAPP. DMATrp is obtained after electrophilic substitution followed by addition (Step A below). Then an amine is methylated by an N-methyltransfersase (Step B). Next, the allyl alcohol is oxidized to the diene (Step C). After 1,4-elimination, the diene undergoes an epoxidation (Step D). Then decarboxylation is followed by the 6-member ring formation and epoxide opened to form terminal alcohol (Step E). Obtained chanoclavine gets oxidized to chanoclavine aldehyde (Step F). Then the second 6-member ring forms and agroclavine is obtained after additional reductase (Steps G and H). Finally elymoclavine is generated after an oxidation (Step I). The last step is NADPH-dependent, and it is suggested that cytochrome P450 is the catalyst. 500px  References  Ergot alkaloids ","title":"Elymoclavine"},{"id":"36112129","title":"2012‚Äì13 Copa Catalunya"},{"id":"36112130","title":"Pennsylvania-class battleship"},{"id":"36112138","text":"Borja Iradier Aguirrezabalaga (March 23, 1980 in San Sebasti√°n, Guip√∫zcoa, Spain) is a Spanish swimmer.

Biography Johann von Eych was born in Heldburg ca. 1404, the son of Karl von Eych and Margaretha von Heitburg. He enrolled at the University of Vienna in 1423, later attending the University of Padua and graduating in 1429 with a doctorate in Holy Scriptures and canon law. He became a canon of Eichst√§tt Cathedral in 1430. He was a rector in Padua from 1433 to 1434. He became Vicar General of the Prince-Bishopric of Eichst√§tt in 1435. He was dean of the faculty of law at the University of Vienna in 1435; again in 1437-38. He spent 1438-41 in the service of Albert II of Germany and Albert VI, Archduke of Austria. During this period, he served as a delegate to the Council of Florence. While at the Council, he began friendships with several prominent ecclesiastics with whom he would later maintain correspondence, including John of Capistrano, Nicholas of Cusa, Jakob von Tueckelhausen, and Bernhard von Waging, as well as with Ulrich Gossembrot, one of the foremost proponents of Renaissance humanism in Northern Europe. Eych returned to the University of Vienna as provost of its law faculty from 1441. After the Battle of St. Jakob an der Sihl (1443), he served as envoy from Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor to the Dauphin of France (afterwards Louis XI of France). On 1 October 1445 the cathedral chapter of Eichst√§tt Cathedral elected him to be the Prince-Bishop of Eichst√§tt; his appointment was confirmed by Dietrich Schenk von Erbach, Archbishop-Elector of Mainz later that month. Eych was consecrated as a bishop by Peter von Schaumberg, Prince- Bishop of Augsburg, on 13 March 1446. A reforming bishop, Eych implemented several of the decrees of the Council of Florence. On his initiative, the cathedral school of Ingolstadt was modified to found the University of Ingolstadt. He celebrated a synod in 1447. In the consistory held in Viterbo on 31 May 1462, Pope Pius II made him a cardinal priest. He never received the red hat or a titulus. He died in Eichst√§tt on 1 January 1464.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The stable block is listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), noted for as a breeding site for lesser horseshoe bats. History=Early land use The first major activity on the land, other than evidence of a few prehistoric flints, was in the medieval period, with pottery finds and indications of iron smelting. The Doomsday Book mentions that a mill might have been present in the area. Industry continued through to the post-medieval period, with kiln waste being found. A 14th- century manor house was present in the area, possibly on the site of the present-day Newton Court. Construction The land for Newton Court, on a south-east facing hillside, was purchased by Admiral Thomas Griffin in the 18th century at the same time as the land at Hadnock and was left to his third son, George Griffin, after his death. Under George, Newton Court was constructed between 1799 and 1802, possibly to the designs of architect Anthony Keck of King's Stanley in Gloucestershire, who died prior to its commencement. The three-storey house was built in the neoclassical style, using coursed red sandstone with Forest of Dean stone dressings and a slate roof. Usage to present day Newton Court Lane, leading to Newton Court Farm The house remained in the Griffin family at least until 1901, when according to Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire it was \\"the seat of George Griffin Griffin esq., M.A., D.L., J.P.\\" The house, stables, and screen wall were listed as Grade II* listed buildings in 2005, whilst the gate piers, gates, and wing walls were Grade II listed in the same year.

It is of importance because it is the only breeding colony in Monmouthshire for the nationally rare and endangered greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and one of only three known sites in Wales. Between 50 and 100 adult and flying young have been recorded on the site, using the stable roof space for nesting. The stable block is also used by a few lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros). The SSSI forms part of the Wye Valley and Forest of Dean Bat Sites Special Area of Conservation.

Initially known as the Screen Directors Guild of New Zealand (SDGNZ), it was founded in 1995 when 18 New Zealand (NZ) directors gathered together at an annual industry conference in Wellington to discuss directors' conditions of work and the need for an organization to represent their interests independent of the Screen Production and Development Association (SPADA), which had evolved from the original concept of a guild that represented both producers & directors.Official website Overview The Directors and Editors Guild of New Zealand operates as a registered Incorporated society that seeks to maintain a forum where directors and editors can define, defend and further their professional industry. The Guild has a membership of approximately 200 directors and editors, many of whom are internationally recognized New Zealand Directors. Sir Peter Robert Jackson has been a member since 1999. Key initiatives and responsibilities of the Guild include lobbying for improved labour standards within the New Zealand screen and motion picture industry and the organization of training programs for Guild members to engage with directors/editors and mentors within the industry. DEGNZ also provides networking opportunities, legal advice, services and concessions, and immigration advice for its members and practitioners in the wider industry. The Guild was not always representative of editors in New Zealand. However, in 2009 an emergence of editors identified the need for representation and were welcomed as members. DEGNZ operates from an office headquarters in Auckland, New Zealand but hosts initiatives and events in other major cities around New Zealand. Unionization The Directors and Editors Guild of New Zealand is not a union. Consideration of whether or not the Guild was to become a craft union was discussed in 2000 when the Labour Government passed the Employment Relations Act making collective bargaining possible. However, because the majority of Guild members continued to see themselves as freelance operators, there was never unified support for unionization. Awards Following the end of the New Zealand Film and Television Awards (1986-2003), the SDGNZ created the New Zealand Screen Awards, an annual awards ceremony honouring the New Zealand film industry. The New Zealand Screen Awards ran from 2005-2007 before merging with the Qantas Television Awards in 2008 and were renamed the Qantas Film and Television Awards. These were subsequently renamed the Aotearoa Film and Television Awards (AFTA) in 2011.Scoop In 2012 the SDGNZ announced that, due to funding and resource restraints, it would not be involved with the AFTAs in 2012, nor would it run a separate film awards. Publications For a period of some years the Guild regularly published a quarterly magazine, Take, featuring news, interviews, events, and humor of particular interest to the New Zealand screen and motion picture industry.Humanities Research Presidents of the Screen Directors Guild of New Zealand * Keith Hunter (1996‚Äì2000) * John Reid (2000‚Äì2003) * Dan Salmon (2003‚Äì2006) * Annie Goldson (2006‚Äì2009) * Peter Bell (2009‚Äì2013) * Peter Roberts (2013‚Äì2016) * Howard Taylor (2016‚ÄìPresent) ReferencesExternal links * Guilds in New Zealand Entertainment industry unions ","title":"Screen Directors Guild of New Zealand"},{"id":"36112345","text":"JFA (Jodie Foster's Army) is an American hardcore punk band formed in 1981, with roots in Arizona and in Southern California skateboard culture.

Alan Bishop of Sun City Girls also played bass for a while. The band was pivotal in the development of the skate punk and Skate Rock scenes. Over the years, the lineup has included many bass players and drummers but the core of Brannon and Redondo has remained constant.

The band's name was thus a dark play on Hinckley's attempt at murdering Reagan ‚Äî a hated figure in the early 1980s punk rock scene. Don Pendleton, then in the band The Deez, and Cornelius, then in the band Jr. Chemists, knew each other from shows around Phoenix, Arizona and from skateboarding. They began playing together after a D.O.A. concert during the band's Hardcore 81 tour. Bam-Bam later joined after meeting Pendleton at an \\"Industrial Dance\\" in Phoenix. Brian Brannon was pulled into the band by Cornelius who met him skateboarding and at punk shows. The band's first show was opening for Black Flag at an Industrial Dance which was one of a series of early Phoenix punk shows. Their first song of the night was \\"Pipetruck\\". Recording history Placebo Records released their debut EP Blatant Localism in late 1981. The band toured the west extensively and played many local shows. Their first national tour was in the summer of 1983 following the release of their first album Valley of the Yakes. The original bassist, Michael Cornelius, left the band in the summer of 1984 prior to the nine-week summer '84 tour. Alan Bishop of labelmates Sun City Girls played bass until Cornelius returned for the 1986 release Nowhere Blossoms. Brian Brannon holds the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer in the United States Navy Reserve. The band received continuing coverage in the influential skateboard magazine Thrasher during the 1980s. Brannon appeared on the April 1987 cover of Thrasher riding backside at the Love Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona. He also appeared on the cover of the April 1989 issue grinding a fakie layback on the edge of the pipe at Thrasherland Skatepark in Glendale, Arizona. In 1990, Brannon took a full-time position as staff writer at Thrasher and eventually became music editor and art director of the magazine until he left in 1997.

It was first introduced in 1997 as a means to block spam email from known malicious IP addresses. DNS blocking can also be applied for outgoing requests as well. Instead of returning the valid IP address of a requested site (for example, instead of 198.35.26.96 being returned by the DNS when \\"www.wikipedia.org\\" is entered into a browser,Hostname to IP Address Lookup, http://www.lookips.com/hostname-ip/www.wikipedia.org if this IP were on a block list, the DNS might reply that the domain is unknown or with a different IP address that directs to a site with a page stating that the requested domain is not permitted). The latter case where the user is redirected to another destination would be considered DNS Spoofing, otherwise known as \\"DNS Poisoning\\".DNS Poisoning - Is it effective?, http://www.watchdoginternational.net/index.php/filtering-technology/56-dns- poisoning-dummy-web-servers/56-isp-dns-poisoning- , Retrieved June 10, 2012 DNS blocking can be applied to individual servers/IP address, or entire blocks of IP addresses for multiple reasons. Some public DNS Resolvers, like Quad9 and CleanBrowsing offer filters are part of their DNS. Quad9, for example, blocks access to known phishing and malicious domains. CleanBrowsing filters out adult content in their effort to protect kids online.  Proposed legislation  In addition to its technical impact, DNS blocking also has many social and political implications. Free speech and due process are key concerns regarding DNS blocking, particularly in the United States. DNS blocking was proposed to be mandated by the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). It is a technique that essentially breaks the fundamental architecture of the internet. The goal for its use as intended by SOPA and PIPA is to prevent users from intentionally or unintentionally accessing web sites and web services that are known to host copyrighted material without authorization. According to an article in Network World magazine, \\"Just about universally, the people responsible for the technical development and operation of the Internet have said that the DNS-blocking proposals would break vital Internet technology while at the same time being entirely ineffectual against people who are serious about violating copyright laws and largely ineffectual against those who do so casually.\\" They go on to claim that politicians who support this type of legislation are motivated by pressure from lobbyists and donors to their campaigns. These lobbyists and donors are often affiliated with special interest groups such as the MPAA and RIAA.  Criticism Google's chairman, Eric Schmidt, is quoted saying \\"I would be very, very careful if I were a government about arbitrarily [implementing] simple solutions to complex problems\\" in reference to DNS blocking and the PIPA bill. Experts claim that users could get around DNS blocking by using foreign search engines and foreign DNS servers. In fact, within two months of the legislation being introduced there were browser plug- ins released that enable users to resolve blocked domains. Numerous industry experts have concerns regarding the effect of DNS blocking on the security of the Internet. A former Bush administration Department of Homeland Security policy director claimed that altering the Domain Name System \\"would do great damage to internet security.\\"  References  External links  * A Not- So-Brief History of DNS Blocking ‚Äî And Why It Sucks * How SOPA could actually break the internet * Don't Break the Internet * 4 Myths About DNS Filtering and Some Truth Domain Name System ","title":"DNS blocking"},{"id":"36112585","text":"George Barnett (1859‚Äì1930) was 12th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps George Barnett may also refer to: * George E.

When he was ten years old, his family moved to Munich, where he continued his middle-school education and went on to attend a university. He studied conducting with Bruno Walter and, at the insistence of his father, earned a doctorate in law.Theodore Albrecht, 101 Years of Symphonic Music in San Antonio, Southwestern Musician, Texas Music Educators Association, March, November 1975San Antonio Express-News, October 11, 1964San Antonio Light, October 6, 1963.Lois Isabel Oppenheimer (n√©e Goldsmith; 1919‚Äì2010), Max Reiter, The Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Association (Oppenheimer was the stepdaughter of Max Reiter)  Immigration to America  Reiter fled his home in Italy in 1939, during the rise in fascism and antisemitism. He arrived in New York in January 1939, where the Steinway family advised him to go to Texas, a place they felt held employment potential. The Steinways felt that Texas was least affected by the Great Depression, and, given strong piano sales, showed great enthusiasm for music. The Steinway family informed Reiter Texans had purchased more Steinway pianos per capita than in any other state.  Move to Texas  With a list of eighteen Texas cities to visit, Reiter's first stop was in Waco, at Baylor University,Max Reiter, Founder of Texas Symphony Orchestras, Is Dead, Reading Eagle, December 14, 1950 where he persuaded the university president to let him work one week with the orchestra, which he did with success. A couple of people from San Antonio who heard the concert persuaded him to try conducting in San Antonio. On June 12, 1939, Reiter gave a demonstration concert at the Sunken Garden Amphitheater. From then on, Reiter flourished as the founding musical director of the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra, while directing the quality symphony orchestra that he founded in Waco.Pioneer Jewish Texans, by Natalie Gene Ornish, (n√©e Moskowitz; 1926) & Sara Alpern-Tarlow, PhD, Texas A & M University Press, pg. 231 (1989)  Death  In December 1950, Reiter was told to give his heart a rest.

The forest forms a one mile long and up to 1/3- mile wide habitat corridor extending from Canyon Park Junior High School in the north almost to the North Creek wetlands near the University of Washington Bothell Campus, and eventually links to the Sammamish River in the south. The North Creek Forest is one of the last remaining mature coniferous forests in the Bothell area. The forest here filters and cools water in streams, wetlands and countless small springs and seeps, along an entire mile of watershed. The cooling of this water is crucial for 5 species of anadromous fish that spawn in North Creek including chum, coho, sockeye, chinook and steelhead. Many other ecosystem services are provided by this forest including carbon sequestration, reduction of surface runoff and cooling of ambient temperatures in surrounding neighborhood. The dominant tree species of North Creek Forest are Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir), Thuja plicata (western redcedar), Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock), Taxus brevifolia (western yew), Abies grandis (grand fir), Acer macrophyllum (big-leaf maple), Frangula purshiana (cascara), Alnus rubra (red alder) and Cornus sericea (red osier dogwood). The most common current vegetation community type is western red cedar - Douglas-fir/big leaf maple (THPL-PSME/ACMA). This forest is home to countless species of wildlife such as black-tailed deer, Douglas squirrel, mountain beaver, barred owl, western screech owl, great horned owl, coopers hawk, merlin, pileated woodpecker, and the pacific tree frog. Urban development has long been the main threat to the forest but, Invasive species takeover is now the major threat to this riparian forest. The most prevalent invasive species in the forest are Rubis bifrons (Himalayan blackberry), Hedera helix (English ivy) and Phalaris arundinacea (reed canary grass). Invasive plant species are known to have adverse effects on native vegetation by using up limited resources in the area like water, space and sunlight. In addition invasive plants can halt a forest in early stages of ecological succession. An active partnership of restoration and conservation in the North Creek Forest serves to prevent net losses of wetlands, net changes in function, and positive gains in biodiversity and habitat quality. This partnership has been in place since 2011 and now includes 5 sites of approximately 1/4 acre each along the edges of the forest. Restoration efforts to the forest have been led by the Friends of North Creek Forest in partnership with the University of Washington's Restoration Ecology Network, offering students the chance for real world application of restoration methods and practices. A protected and restored North Creek Forest provides a healthy forested site along the vital Sammamish river habitat corridor within an urban area of constant disturbance and change. North Creek Forest is used as an education area for students of all ages. At its highest level it can be a research site for master's or PhD candidates. It is used consistently as a site in the University of Washington restoration ecology network and as a living classroom for many courses at University of Washington Bothell. Many other schools from elementary level and up visit here for educational purposes. In November 2015, the City of Bothell received a Bravo Award, a grant from the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Funding Board, for its efforts to conserve the forest. The grant helped enable Bothell to secure the funding to purchase the final 22 acres needed to complete the 64 acre North Creek Forest. After securing additional funding, On November 8, 2016, the Bothell City Council authorized the purchase of the final tract needed to preserve the whole of the forest.

Currently, Consejo de Salud Rural Andino in Bolivia has its headquarters in the city of La Paz, a regional office in El Alto, and a regional office in the city of Montero. Curamericas Global and CSRA are known for their development of the Census-Based, Impact-Oriented Methodology. The CBIO is a community-based primary health care model that allows to better understand, effectively treat and accurately measure outcomes and impacts for the most common found causes of unnecessary suffering, sickness, including mortality reduction using census information and having collaboration from the community. CBIO implementation will first identify the entire programm population through visits at least biannually to all homes and then target selected high-impact services to those at highest risk of death. The CBIO approach incorporates: A community census of households and a health assessment of the project area, a drawing of maps and numbering of households, and the development of a program plan with community members that includes both epidemiologically driven health objectives as well as community perceived health priorities. Native doctors, nurses, community health workers, and volunteers then conduct regularly scheduled home visits to targeted households whose census information reveals a high risk of illness or death. During these home visits, health knowledge and practices are measured and vital events are recorded so that families‚Äô illnesses, health experiences, deaths, births, and migrations are tracked. This information is entered into a health information system so; program interventions can be measured and then analyzed with the participation of local people and leaders of the community.

He was a prolific theologian who made a notable contribution to the development of British covenant theology by describing the link between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace and also demonstrating the relationship between justification and covenant theology. Additionally, he wrote two catechisms and a book advocating lay preaching. He also had close ties with a radical political movement. Early life Petto was born in England in 1624, though his birthplace and parentage are unknown. Petto's early life coincided with the tumultuous reign of Charles I. It is possible that the turbulent times influenced Petto's decision to embrace religious nonconformity. Despite the religious turmoil of the times, Petto attended Cambridge University to study to become a minister. He was enrolled in St. Catharine's College as a \\"sizar\\" (a student granted a ration of food and lodging for free due to financial need).Michael Brown, Christ and the Covenant: The Covenant Theology of Samuel Petto (1624-1711) (Grand Rapids: Reformation Heritage Books, 2012), 9-11. Petto graduated with his bachelor's degree in 1647, and some records indicate that he also earned a master's degree, though no date is given.See the entry on Petto in A.G. Matthews, Calamy Revised: Being a Revision of Edmund Calamy's Account of the Ministers and Others Ejected and Silenced, 1660-62 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1934, repr., 1988), 388. St. Catharine's College was considered a center for theological study.John Twigg, A History of Queen's College, Cambridge 1448-1986 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 104. Petto would have studied under Ralph Brownrigg (1592-1659) and William Spurstowe (1605‚Äì66), both of whom were delegates at the Westminster Assembly and Calvinistic in their theology.Mark Dever, Richard Sibbes: Puritanism and Calvinism in Late Elizabethan and Early Stuart England (Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 2000), 34-48. This Calvinistic influence was seen later as Petto favorably quoted John Calvin (1509‚Äì64), Richard Sibbes (1577-1635), Samuel Bolton (1606‚Äì54), John Owen (1616‚Äì83), and the Heidelberg Catechism.See Samuel Petto, The difference between the Old and New Covenant Stated and Explained: With an Exposition of the Covenant of Grace in the Principal Concernments of it (London, 1674), 176, 44, 113, 177. Ministerial career Petto was ordained to the ministry in 1648. He was installed as rector at Sandcroft in the deanery of South Elmham. It seems that he was married soon afterward, eventually having five children. In 1655, his wife Mary died. In 1657, he was appointed as an assistant to the Suffolk commission of Triers and Objectors, which examined ministers, candidates, and their qualifications.See entry by Elliot Vernon in Francis J. Bremer and Tom Webster, eds., Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2006), 200-01. Petto was an Independent or Non-Separating Congregationalist. Their confession of faith was the Savoy Declaration of Faith and Order (1658), which was essentially a version of the Westminster Confession of Faith modified to fit Congregationalist church polity (it was based on local churches, not national or regional assemblies). While formally trained as a minister, Petto's ecclesiology allowed him to teach that qualified laymen could be allowed to preach in congregations. This view was keenly contested and Petto defended his position at great length.See John Martin, Samuel Petto, and Frederick Woodal, The Preacher Sent: or, A Vindication of the Liberty of Public Preaching, By some men not Ordained (London, 1657). When the crown was restored in 1660, Petto was ejected from his pulpit. By 1669, Petto was ministering in Norfolk. In 1672, he was officially licensed as a congregational minister under Charles II's Act of Indulgence. Petto began his longest tenure as a minister in 1674, when he became the minister of a congregation in the town of Sudbury, Suffolk. It was an independent congregation that met in a barn belonging to Robert Sewell. The congregation filled a need in the town, which had not had a regular minister for some time.C. Sperling, ed., A short history of the borough of Sudbury‚Ä¶compiled from materials collected by W.W. Hudson (Sudbury, UK, 1896), 152-53. The congregation was called All Saints' Church and Petto ministered there until his death 1711. He was buried in the churchyard on September 21. Theological opinions In addition to being an Independent minister, Petto was also a well-respected theologian. His first work was on Pneumatology (doctrine of the Holy Spirit) and it dealt primarily with the doctrine of assurance of salvation and the Spirit's work of sealing. Following mainstream Puritan thought, Petto believed that sealing of the Spirit was a separate act from the indwelling of the Spirit. The sealing of the Spirit granted to individual believers the confidence that God was their Father and that they were truly converted.See Samuel Petto, The Voice of the Spirit, or An Essay Toward the Discoverie of the witnessing of the Spirit by opening and answering these following weighty Queries (London, 1654). Later in life Petto seemed to have shifted in his view and like Owen began to see that sealing and indwelling were more closely related, and that both were given to believers upon their initial salvation.On Petto's shift see The Voice of the Spirit and The difference between the Old and New Covenant Stated and Explained, particularly chapters 5, 12-14; for Owen's view see his work on the Holy Spirit, Pneumatologia (1693). He wrote two catechisms, A Short Scriptural Catechism for Little Children and A Large Scriptural Catechism, while in Norfolk. The catechism answers were quotations of various biblical passages and the catechisms were designed to encourage memorization of the Bible. Petto also believed that qualified laymen could preach in churches (see above). Petto also seems to have had some ties to the Fifth Monarchy movement, though it is not clear how closely he was connected. This group wanted the nation to be ruled by Christians and to have the laws based on the Bible. The name was taken from Nebuchadnezzar's dream in the book of Daniel, where four kingdoms are represented (Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome). The fifth kingdom was the kingdom of Christ that would possibly be established around the year 1666.Michael Watts, The Dissenters: From the Reformation to the French Revolution (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978; reprint, 1985), 135. He associated with Frederick Woodal and published with John Tillinghast (d. 1655) Six Several Treatises of John Tillinghast, both leading members of the Fifth Monarchy movement. This close association with this group did not seem to damage Petto's relationship with John Owen, who was one of the leading Independent opponents of the movement. Petto's greatest theological influence came from his highly regarded work on covenant theology, The difference between the Old and New Covenant Stated and Explained: With an Exposition of the Covenant of Grace in the Principal Concernments of it.Samuel Petto, The difference between the Old and New Covenant Stated and Explained: With an Exposition of the Covenant of Grace in the Principal Concernments of it. In this work Petto skillfully navigated and addressed the many contemporary debates concerning covenant theology showing an exceptional, detailed understanding of the subject. Petto explored the relationship of the Mosaic covenant with the covenant of grace. He made an important connection between the covenants and the Protestant doctrine of justification. His careful work won him the praise of many contemporary theologians including the eminent John Owen, who wrote the book's foreword.For an extended analysis of this work and Petto's covenant theology see Michael Brown, Christ and the Condition: The Covenant Theology of Samuel Petto (1624-1711) (Grand Rapids: Reformation Heritage Books, 2012). Influence While Petto was influential in his own time, he has not received as much attention in modern times despite a recent resurgence in Puritan studies. One reason for his lack of long-term influence may have been his Independent church convictions as well as his more radical political associations with the Fifth Monarchy movement. Nevertheless, Petto's combination of vigorous pastoral ministry and sophisticated theological acumen is typical of many Puritan and Reformed ministers. As research on this time period continues, perhaps Petto's influence will be better understood and appreciated.
