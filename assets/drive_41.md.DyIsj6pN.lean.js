A thwarted artist due to shortsightedness, he visited many of the great galleries of Europe in his youth. At age 24 he migrated to Australia and quickly associated with leading artists of the Heidelberg School and the bohemian artists' camps around Sydney Harbour in the 1890s. He built a successful career in shipping and used his moderate wealth to support waves of Australian artists in the first half of the twentieth century. Through extensive donations to the Art Gallery of New South Wales and particularly the Armidale Teachers' College he became one of the greatest benefactors in Australian art history. Early life Hinton's early schooling was at Mr Hester's school, Margate, and Mr Southee's school, Ramsgate, before he attended Whitgift Grammar School, South Croydon, until fifth form in 1883. His passion for art developed at an early age. As a youth he took parentally-financed vacations with his brother to some of the great galleries of Europe. He even attended art classes at Continental schools, but acute near-sightedness frustrated any hope of becoming an artist himself.E.S. Elphick, \\"Howard Hinton and his Bequest,\\" in An Armidale Album: Glimpses of Armidale's History and Development in Word, Sketch and Photograph, comp. by Lionel Gilbert, E.S. Elphick, David Rose and Dennis Hope. (Armidale, N.S.W.: New England Regional Art Museum Association, 1982), 274-292. Howard's father, Thomas, was a commission merchant, a broker trading for marginal returns. Howard was given early experience in this trade which was to be the basis for his future career. As a young man Hinton was rather plump, pink, short- sighted, wearing very thick optical lenses, diffident in manner, hesitant in speech, shy, and he \\"only really dropped his guard with his closest friends.\\" Migration to Australia and employment Hinton sailed to Australia on board the Torridon departing London in 1890 at the age of twenty two.UK and Ireland. Outward Passenger Lists, 1890 - 1960. Note that Hinton's surname is incorrectly recorded as Honton. Through the shipping agent Dangar, Gedye & Co. he gained employment with merchant agents W. & A. McArthur Ltd. in Sydney. Employed in shipping, Hinton took the opportunity to combine business and travel. He journeyed widely through the Pacific in the 1890s on many vessels. On an 1898 trip he met and stayed with the New Zealand artist Charles Goldie before travelling on to Raratonga and Tahiti. Then, in 1904, his firm gave him charge of a speculative venture to take a refurbished steamer, the Macquarie, to the Far East carrying wheat, wool, oats and paying passengers to Yokohama. The further use or disposal of the vessel was Hinton's responsibility. Once in Japan he shrewdly took advantage of the Russo-Japanese War to charter the ship for transporting war materials, and he continued trading in Asian waters for two years. Sixty-two pages of diary entries and four photographic albums give detailed record of these exotic years: trading, sightseeing and dining between ports in Japan, China, Hong Kong and Vietnam. He finally sold the Macquarie for more than double the firm's required price and returned to Sydney via Manila and German New Guinea in 1906. When his firm was reconstituted in 1908 as the McArthur Shipping & Agency Co. Ltd., Hinton remained with the company, thus spending his entire working life in Australia with the one business, rising to directorship in 1916 and enjoying moderate wealth. At the age of 61 in 1928 he retired and set out on an extended stay in England and Europe including visits to many art galleries and studios. Though he corresponded frequently he did not return to Australia till 1931. Lifestyle and involvement with arts Immediately after migrating to Australia in 1891 Hinton made friends with artists including Julian Ashton, Livingston Hopkins, Tom Roberts, Albert Henry Fullwood and Arthur Streeton. He was a frequent visitor to and sometime inhabitant of several of the artists' camps set up on the foreshores of Sydney harbourStewart, Meg and Olley, Margaret, 1923-2011 Margaret Olley : far from a still life (Rev. and updated ed). Random House Australia, North Sydney, 2012. p.108, and began buying paintings. His art purchasing was predominantly based in Sydney, on Sydney exhibitions, galleries and studios. He boarded with the Sabiel family at Glenmire in Stanley Street in nearby Balmoral for ten years, and remained closely connected with the Sabiels in the ensuing years. Following his two years trading in Asia, he returned to Glenmire then lived in other boarding houses on Sydney's north shore, at times taking the same address as the Sabiels. In 1919 Hinton and the Sabiels took rooms for a period in Hazelhurst, an upmarket boarding house in Murdoch Street Cremorne, and in 1920 Hinton became a permanent boarder there, living the life of a bachelor in a serviced room till his death in 1948. Laundry, starched shirts and meals were provided with his board. He ate a traditional breakfast, dressed for a three-course dinner - sometimes with invited guests - and usually took lunch in town, often at the Millions Club in Rowe Street which still exists as the Sydney Club. He frequently wore spats and always carried a walking stick. He was quiet, courteous and self-effacing, but also exceedingly generous, giving paintings to friends and presents to Hazelhurst staff, all of whom he remembered in his will. Besides diarising his travels, Hinton was an active correspondent and dabbled in occasional verse, both with humour and gentle wit. He was a firm Anglican and a loyalist. At the time of World War I he was twice refused enlistment in the AIF because of his poor eyesight. However, he \\"gave freely of his money during this war and also in World War II when he divided his funds on the strict basis of a quarter for buying paintings from needy young artists and three quarters for the R.A.A.F. and A.I.F. Comfort Funds.\\" He rarely spoke of his charitable works but examples are known, from helping unemployed youths to buying beds for a youth hostel in Narrabeen, and buying paintings from artists struggling in the Great Depression. Patron and benefactor of Australian art From his Sydney base Hinton continued to support artists, for example assisting Elioth Gruner with overseas travel and assisting the widow and family of deceased young artist J J Hilder.Robert Heather, \\"Foreword,\\" in Hinton: Treasures of Australian Art; Souvenir booklet for the permanent exhibition at the New England Regional Art Museum (Armidale, N.S.W.: New England Regional Art Museum, 2018. He visited artists' studios and was a familiar figure at galleries, openings and showrooms. He used his wealth to acquire their work despite having little display or storage space in his boarding-house room. He famously kept fewer than a dozen cherished works on the walls - and a similar number of Norman Lindsay watercolours and drawings in a trunk by his bed - whilst eventually giving in excess of 1,500 works to institutions. Norman Lindsay wrote that Hinton \\"worked hard at his business career only to acquire money to devote to art, spending nothing on himself\\",Norman Lindsay, \\"The Mission,\\" in A Memorial Volume to Howard Hinton, Patron of Art, ed. Roy H. Goddard (Sydney: Angus and Robertson, 1951), 11. and Leon Gellert wrote that Hinton \\"never \\"donated\\" his gifts. They were transmitted - ever so gently, as though by sleight-of- hand.\\"Gellert, Leon, Something Personal Unobtrusive Philanthropist, The Sydney Morning Herald, Sat 9 Jun 1951 p.10 National Art Gallery of New South Wales Hinton made his first gift of artworks to the Art Gallery of New South Wales (then the National Art Gallery of New South Wales) in 1914. He continued giving to the gallery and was made a trustee in 1919, a position he held till his death in 1948, by which time he had donated 122 pictures including important works by E. Phillips Fox, Elioth Gruner, George Lambert, Roberts and Streeton. During his retirement holiday to England and Europe in 1928 he purchased and forwarded several paintings as further donations to the gallery. However, as these were not Australian works and acquired without consultation, his fellow Trustees decided to defer acceptance. Hinton offered more European works in 1929, but was informed that any such paintings must be approved before being acquired for donation. It is speculated that Hinton fell out with his fellow Trustees over this issue, and that this led to him channeling his future donations towards a different institution - the Armidale Teachers' College - but in fact he continued as a Trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales and gave further (Australian) paintings which were accepted.Joseph Eisenberg and Tony Geddes, \\"The Howard Hinton Art Collection: one man's passion for giving.\\" (Mosman, N.S.W.: Mosman Art Gallery, 2005). Armidale Teachers' College These constrictions on his ability to donate works of his choice to the state gallery, however, did encourage him to look elsewhere. While still in England, he wrote his enquiry to the Minister of Education, David Drummond, who had appointed him as a Trustee. Drummond was the NSW state member for Armidale and asked the Director of Education in New South Wales (NSW), S.H. Smith, to write to Hinton suggesting the recently founded Armidale Teachers' College, the first teachers' college built outside the Sydney metropolitan area to train country teachers for country service, as a destination for his donations. Hinton agreed, and the Principal of the Teachers' College, C.B. Newling, wrote to him in London and \\"profusely accepted the donation.\\" The first work received, Adrian Stokes' The Lock Gates, was hung in the Teachers' College while Hinton was still abroad. From 1931 paintings began to arrive regularly at the College, including those by the European artists declined by the National Art Gallery of New South Wales. Hinton visited the Armidale institution in 1932 and was feted by students and staff. In 1933 he dispatched six separate crates containing 51 works including landmark paintings such as Tom Roberts' Mosman's Bay. In that year he also presented a Declaration of Trust through the Crown Solicitor to the Armidale Teachers' College, formally stating the terms of his continuing gift. In appreciation of his benefactions, the 1933 student session presented to the College a bronze bust of Hinton by Rayner Hoff. Similarly, the 1935-6 session commissioned a Hinton portrait by Norman Carter. Hinton made eight more visits to the Teachers' College in the ensuing years, and formed a close relationship with the first Principal, C.B. Newling, with whom he kept up written correspondence. He also commissioned and gave two themed stained glass windows by Norman Carter to the College - Wisdom in 1935, and Sport in 1937. Following his example, other donors added works to the Howard Hinton Collection. Hinton clearly derived pleasure from buying and giving art, and articulated his motives in 1947: \\"My object was to provide a complete collection illustrating the development of Australian art from 1880 onwards, and my action in making the gift to the Armidale Teachers' College was prompted by my great interest in Australian education ...\\" Caroline Downer, \\"Hinton: Munificent Benefactor\\" in Munificence: the Story of the Howard Hinton Collection (Armidale, N.S.W.: New England Regional Art Museum, 2014), 9. His beliefs were in keeping with the view of art as a means of inculcating civilising values.Kerby, Martin and Baguley, Margaret, \\"Regional Jewel: New England Regional Art Museum (NERAM) and The Howard Hinton Collection\\". In Australian art education, v.39 no.1, 2018. pp.37 Hinton has been described by Arthur Streeton and Norman Lindsay as one of Australia's great art benefactors alongside Alfred Felton, David Scott Mitchell and Sir Baldwin Spencer.E.S. Elphick, \\"Hinton, Howard (1867‚Äì1948),\\" in Australian Dictionary of Biography, (Melbourne, Vic: Melbourne University Press, 1983), v.9. By the end of his life in 1948 he had donated over a thousand works to the Teachers' College in Armidale representing the work of hundreds of Australian artists including Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts, Nora Heysen, Hans Heysen, Elioth Gruner, Margaret Preston, William Dobell, Adrian Feint, Ethel Spowers, Roy De Maistre, Thea Proctor, Lloyd Rees, and the Lindsay family. Barry Pearce, former head curator of Australian Art at the Art Gallery of New South Wales described the Hinton donation as including \\"many magnificent Australian landscapes by a range of major and minor artists ... crowned by such masterpieces as Arthur Streeton's Morning Sketch (aka McMahon's Point Ferry) 1890 and Near Streeton's camp at Sirius Cove, 1892 and, the jewel in the crown, Mosman's Bay, 1894 by Tom Roberts.\\"Barry Pearce, \\"The man in a room,\\" in Munificence: the story of the Howard Hinton Collection (Armidale, N.S.W.: New England Regional Art Museum, 2014), 17. A complete list of works donated to both the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Armidale Teachers' College was published in 1951. The Hinton donations included his valuable collections of art books, memorabilia, historical documents, journals and catalogues, largely incorporated into the NERAM library, and the Howard Hinton Archive.The Howard Hinton Archive held in the New England egional Art Museum contains both personal reminiscences of Howard Hinton - letters, diaries, poems, historical documents surrounding the bequest - and records of previous owners, valuations, exhibition histories. New England Regional Art Museum (NERAM) In 1971 the Armidale Teachers' College became a College of Advanced Education and began offering a range of courses beyond teaching. By the 1970s it was evident that the valuable and significant works donated by Hinton required levels of secure housing, curatorship, preservation and environmental management not available within the open doors and corridors of a public college. The Armidale community began a long-term fundraising effort to build a dedicated museum, and with matching grants from the NSW State government the New England Regional Art Museum (NERAM) was formally opened by the Premier of NSW, the Honourable Neville Wran QC, on 26 March 1983..

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. History Entrance into the church off of 24th Street. The congregation began in 1888 as Sixth Presbyterian Church and became Cottage Grove Avenue Presbyterian in 1910. They originally worshiped in tents and in a commercial building near the location of the present building. A brick, Gothic Revival church building was completed on this property in 1893. It was destroyed two years later in a fire caused by lightning. A new brick church was completed at the same location in 1903. Structural flaws in the building were diagnosed ten years later. The congregation maintained the Sunday School wing and replaced the sanctuary in 1918. Waterloo, Iowa architect Clinton P. Shockley designed the 1918 sanctuary in the Neoclassical style. It was built by Des Moines contractor B. F. Segner. The building is a trapezoid, matching its lot, and features a veneer of Bedford stone and a flat roof. The south and east elevations feature five bays separated by four pilasters. A semi-circular niche is located in the southeast elevation. On the same elevation the maxim, \\"Ye Shall Know the Truth and the Truth Shall Make You Free\\" is cut into the limestone frieze. A veneer of stone was applied to the south elevation of the Sunday School wing, with its original painted brick on the other elevations. At about the same time as the present sanctuary was built, the congregation began to take on the Progressive ideals of social reform and community service. The congregation's name change suggests its commitment to the neighborhood, and the new sanctuary does not have any traditional church embellishments on the exterior, but that of a home. The maxim etched into the southeast elevation stresses moral rectitude rather than Christian theology. During the pastorates of the Revs. William Burton Sanford and James Thompson Mordy the congregation took on the issues of restricted residential zoning in the area, the Negro Community Center, and youth programs. During the 1960s and the 1970s, the development of Interstate 235 to the south cut through the neighborhood, and the congregation found itself as an inner-city church. That provided it with opportunities for more community service. At the same time the congregation began to lose membership, and in 2014 it decided to disband. The Presbytery of Des Moines now owns the building. They will continue to use the building for their offices, for a social outreach ministry to the areas homeless, and two Sudanese congregations, whose members emigrated to this country after civil wars in Sudan and South Sudan.

For most of his life, he resided at 2 Phillips Street in Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood. Coburn was one of the wealthiest African Americans in Boston of his time. His property on the North Slope of Beacon Hill had the third highest real property value in a 1850 census. Coburn was heavily involved in abolition-related work within his community, specifically work related to the New England Freedom Association and the Massasoit Guards.  Entrepreneurial career  Coburn worked as a building contractor, tailor, and clothier. He managed two clothing stores, one at 20 Brattle Street and another at 59 Cornhill Street. His business focused on tailoring clothes and selling clothes which were advertised to be the current trend. Coburn sold cashmere clothing, doeskins, tweeds and vestings. He also sold men's garments, and cleaned and repaired clothes. In the mid 1860s, Coburn changed the name of his clothing store to W.T. Coburn Clothing Store, after his son Wendell T. Coburn. Letter to coloured people of Massachusetts, encouraging them to donate money to assist William Lloyd Garrison, editor of The Liberator, financially so he can retire. Coburn also co-owned a profitable gaming house, named the Coburn Gaming House, with his brother-in-law Ira Gray. The Coburn Gaming House doubled as a safe house on the Underground Railroad. The main clientele of the gaming house was aristocratic African-Americans. This business brought Coburn even more wealth and allowed him to finance many rescue operations for fugitive slaves like that of Shadrach Minkins.  Contributions to abolitionism  Coburn was the treasurer of the New England Freedom Association, an association that focused on helping fugitive slaves. He patronized The Liberator, a local abolitionist newspaper, by publishing advertisements for his stores and acknowledgments to the people who had donated to the New England Freedom Association. In addition, he would also put out announcements offering lodging to those in need. In 1854, Coburn founded the Massasoit Guards, a black military company, to police Beacon Hill and protect residents from slave catchers. He served as the company's captain. The Massasoit Guards were never officially recognized by the state, despite repeated petitions by attorney Robert Morris. The group was named after a Wampanoag chief who had been friendly to Massachusetts colonists. Coburn also recruited volunteers for the militant abolitionist John Brown.  Family and legacy  Coburn was married to Emeline Coburn and had one adopted son named Wendell Coburn. Between 1843 and 1844, he commissioned architect Asher Benjamin to design a house for him at the corner of Phillips and Irving Streets. Coburn died in 1873 and left most of his belongings to his son Wendell Coburn. His house, located on Beacon Hill, is now a site on Boston's Black Heritage Trail.

Early life and career Lorck grew up in Waipukurau and trained as a journalist. Before entering parliament, she owned a public relations company. Political career At the election, Lorck, a Hastings business woman, stood as a candidate in the electorate for the Labour Party, and did not stand on the Labour list. As a first time candidate she made significant progress into the margin against incumbent Craig Foss, and announced she would stand again at the election. She was ranked 46 on the Labour party list. Before standing as a Labour candidate, Lorck, who had vocally opposed Labour sacking the Hawke's Bay District Health Board (DHB), volunteered to phone canvass to motivate voter turnout for two hours for the National Party. She was never a member of the party. During a tightly fought contest, in July 2017 a complaint by a right-wing blogger, was made against Lorck to the Advertising Standards Authority over her billboard wording of \\"Your Local MP\\". Lorck responded by stating the intention of the message was to convey that she lived in the Tukituki electorate while National candidate Lawrence Yule lived in neighboring Napier. Lorck again made significant inroads into the majority but was not elected, nor ranked high enough on the Labour list to be elected to Parliament. In 2019 Lorck was elected to the Hawke's Bay DHB, as the highest polling new candidate. She served as part of the governance of the region‚Äôs response to Covid 19. Lorck advocates for a local cardiology centre, costed at $15 million, to enable life-saving surgery locally. At the 2020 general election, Lorck was selected as the Labour candidate for Tukituki for the third time. She was given the Labour Party‚Äôs endorsement to run a local MP campaign and consequently was not on the party list. This time unseated Yule and returned the electorate to Labour for the first time since 2002.

He is best known for his associations with Benjamin Hornigold and Bartholomew Roberts. History Daniel Porter was involved with pirate Benjamin Hornigold, possibly as early as 1716. His brother Thomas Porter was a known crew member of Hornigold‚Äôs sloop Bennett, and was formerly master aboard Daniel Porter‚Äôs sloop Mayflower. Porter took the general pardon offered by King George in 1717 to all pirates who surrendered within a year. Charleston pirate and merchant Richard Tookerman traded supplies between South Carolina and the Caribbean with the assistance of Porter, whose brother owned property in the state as well. Tookerman was arrested and released for his role in helping Stede Bonnet escape prison, then arrested again for robbing William Rhett, the militia Colonel who‚Äôd helped capture Bonnet both times. Tookerman escaped and fled to Virginia and then to Barbados. By June 1720 he was sailing with the Porters aboard the Mayflower. Porter and Tookerman approached Bartholomew Roberts soon after, asking for supplies and advice on taking up piracy. The two \\"addressed the Pyrate, as the Queen of Sheba did Solomon, to wit, That having heard of his Fame and Achievements, they had put in there to learn his Art and Wisdom in the Business of pyrating, being Vessels on the same honourable Design with himself; and hoped with the Communication of his Knowledge, they should also receive his Charity, being in want of Necessaries for such Adventures. Roberts was won upon by the Peculiarity and Bluntness of these two Men and gave them Powder, Arms, and what ever else they had Occasion for, spent two or three merry Nights with them, and at parting, said, he hoped the Lord would Prosper their handy Works.‚Äù Roberts and his men referred to them as ‚Äúprivate pirates‚Äù ‚Äì men whose fortune was made trading with pirates rather than engaging in any actual piracy of their own. Roberts claimed that he had been approached by two sloops, not one. Bahamas Governor Woodes Rogers wrote in July 1720 that he was suspicious of two pirates who‚Äôd sailed quickly after loading crew under a supposed commission from New York Governor Robert Hunter; one was Porter, the other a Captain named Fox. That August they captured another sloop out of New York and raided settlements near Saint- Domingue. Porter and Fox were soon joined by a third pirate named Miller. Rumors heard by Rogers during a visit to Charleston in 1721 told that Tookerman and Porter had turned to piracy together, which the Roberts encounter agrees with. In Port Royal later that year Tookerman was arrested for firing a salute on King James II‚Äôs birthday, outing himself as a Jacobite; he was sent to London for trial then returned to America, though he died at sea soon after. Tookerman was acting as master of Captain Wells' sloop Adventure at the time, so Porter may have replaced Tookerman with his own brother Thomas by then; Daniel Porter‚Äôs further activities are not well recorded.

In 1528, Giovanni Ludovico, Marquess of Saluzzo, was imprisoned in the castle.

The generated information has the potential to create a vastly detailed record of an individual's daily trails, which includes the individual's thoughts and interests, whom they communicate with, information about the organizations with which they work or interact with and so forth. This information can be dispersed to a dozen organizations and servers depending on their use. Along with Individuals, the activities of institutions and organizations are also tracked. Data Shadows are closely linked with data footprints, which are defined as the data that has been left behind by the individual themselves through various activities such as online activities, communication information, and transactions. In a chapter for the book Geography and Technology, researcher Matthew Zook and his co-authors note that data shadows have come as a result of people becoming \\"digital individuals\\" and that these shadows are continually evolving and changing. They are used to model and predict political opinions, and make inferences about a person's political values or susceptibility to advertising.  Digital footprint  The data or digital footprints are obtained from monitoring and tracking individuals‚Äô digital activities. Digital footprints provide a drive for companies such as Facebook and Google to invest in obtaining data generated from these footprints, in order to be sold to marketers. As illustrated by Bodle, users are willing to give up their information to companies they trust. Although collecting individuals‚Äô data raises several ethical concerns, it can be valuable for the healthcare data analytics and new health services. For instance, access to such data can help healthcare services shed light on the causes of disease, the effects or side-effects the treatments might have and can facilitate a tailored analysis according to the individual‚Äôs characteristics.  Dataveillance  Dataveillance gives rise to data shadows since it allows for the identification, classification and representation of individuals or organizations. Dataveillance is defined as a mode of surveillance which tracks, monitors or regulates an individual using digital activity including their personal details and social media activities. In 2013, Edward Snowden‚Äôs revelations on the National Security Agency's PRISM program, that the organization would ‚Äúreceive‚Äù emails, video clips, photos, voice and video calls, social networking details, logins and other data held by a range of US internet firms‚Äù. It is also revealed that corporate social networks share their information with the intelligence agencies. Platform owners such as Google and Facebook, anchor the trust of their users and reassure them that their information is protected through portrayal of corporate codes of conduct such as ‚ÄúDo no evil‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaking the world transparent and connected‚Äù However, as pointed out by Bodle, platform owners are themselves collecting the user‚Äôs information and using it for purposes they deem to be necessary.  Privacy  Europe has brought about a long- awaited revision to their data protection framework called the Data Protection Directive. According to this, European Union countries are forced to remove personal data of individuals upon their request if the information is obsolete or irrelevant. Information privacy is defined as the right that individuals have over the data about themselves when subjected to a third party, and that the data should not be available to any organization or person without their approval.

It aired on November 7, 2017, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Ryan Murphy & Brad Falchuk, and directed by Bradley Buecker. Plot 2016 Kai attends anger management counseling after slapping one of Winter's friends following an argument regarding Donald Trump‚Äôs likelihood of becoming president. Bebe Babbitt, Kai‚Äôs counselor, tells him that Trump is her favorite politician and that he should consider running for office. Bebe asserts that Kai‚Äôs purpose is to ‚Äúunleash feminine rage‚Äù. 2017 As Kai gives a speech at a political rally, a protestor sprays him in the face with mace. Later that evening, Kai insists that Winter and Ally modify the ice cream truck to avoid detection. Winter asks Ally about the circumstances of Ivy's death and wonders if Kai had something to do with it. The incumbent senator whom Kai is challenging in the midterm elections dismisses Kai's campaign on television and Kai resolves to orchestrate a ‚Äúnight of a thousand Tates‚Äù, referring to the infamous Tate murders. He tells the militiamen that on August 9, 1969, Charles Manson's \\"family\\", including Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Linda Kasabian, killed Sharon Tate and four of her friends at her home in Beverly Hills. Atkins stabbed Tate, who was eight months pregnant, multiple times and wrote the word ‚Äúpig‚Äù in blood on the door to the house. Gary and a few of Kai's followers break into a local Planned Parenthood office. Once inside, Gary is surrounded by Kai and his followers wearing their clown attire and he is stabbed to death. The next morning, a woman who works at the office stumbles across Gary's corpse lying at the front door next to a sign written in his blood that reads \\"stop the slaughter\\". Beverly reports on the murder while interviewing Kai. Kai suggests in the interview that the incumbent senator is responsible for Gary's murder. When the camera stops filming, Kai chastises Beverly's monotone delivery. At the Butchery, Winter approaches Beverly and apologizes for framing her for Samuels' murder. She then gives Beverly a train ticket to Montana where Winter says she can start a new life and escape from the cult. Beverly tells Winter that she will always be loyal to Kai. Kai begins to suspect that there is a mole in the cult. He runs up to his parents‚Äô bedroom trying to identify the source of a perpetual buzzing sound. He hallucinates Dr. Vincent coming back to life and giving him advice. He then hallucinates Charles Manson stabbing Vincent. Manson tells Kai that he can't trust women. Ally tells Kai that she has found a listening device. The doorbell rings and Kai instructs Ally to stay where she is. Kai answers the door and finds Bebe standing there. They both go to the basement where Bebe tells Kai that he isn't keeping his end of the deal they made a year ago. Bebe pulls a gun on Kai and Ally shoots her in the back of the head. That evening, Winter shaves Kai's head in the bathroom. Kai tells Winter that he feels as though she's slipping away and she tells Kai that every follower of his will leave him one day except for her. Kai tells Winter that he is planning on having her by his side when he is in the White House and they briefly hug each other. Kai then suggests that Winter run away to Montana and pulls out the train ticket she gave to Beverly earlier. In the basement, Kai, convinced that Winter is the mole, demands her to confess. When she denies that she is the mole and refuses to confess, Kai tearfully strangles her to death. Speedwagon runs to his car afterwards and destroys a wire. Ally enters his car and greets him contentedly. Reception \\"Charles (Manson) in Charge\\" was watched by 1.82 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.8 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49.

Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5, saying \\"While Kai's subversion and Ally's apparent conversion are unexpected, American Horror Story: Cult doesn't quite pull the rug out from under us this week. The recreation of the murders is expertly done, fulfilling the anticipation of the promised gore, but the American horror at the center of the episode is more sad than frightening. If nothing else, this episode convinced me that Butte, Montana, is the scariest place on earth.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A-. She particularly praised the scenes with Charles Manson, calling them \\"horrifying even by AHS standards\\". She also enjoyed Billie Lourd's performance in this episode. However, she noticed that some plot points, like Gary's death, could only be explained by Kai's madness, \\"because it otherwise makes absolutely no sense\\". Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 6 out of 10, with a mixed review. He said \\"A week out from the finale, Cult revealed that Kai was never the person we'd come to know, even in flashbacks. Instead, he was a bitter woman hater who was most definitely not pretending to be a woman hater for the sake of a twist that could have flipped the show on its ear. With increasing paranoia and drug use, Kai went from a man leading an ambitious and lethal social experiment to... just another unremarkable trolling bigot.\\" References External links * American Horror Story: Cult episodes Cultural depictions of Charles Manson Sororicide in fiction Television episodes written by Brad Falchuk Television episodes written by Ryan Murphy (writer) ","title":"Charles (Manson) in Charge"},{"id":"55291161","text":"\\"Drink the Kool-Aid\\" is the ninth episode of the seventh season of the anthology television series American Horror Story.

After affirming the loyalty of his militiamen, Kai declares his intention to run for Senate at a city council meeting. Winter explains her plan on how to escape a cult to Ally and Ivy. Before they can set a plan in motion, Ally, Ivy, and Winter are escorted to the Anderson house by Speedwagon and the other militiamen and led to the basement where Beverly attacks Winter for blaming Samuels' death on her. Yearning to draw a connection between his own political movement and the mass suicide at Jonestown committed by Jim Jones, Kai requires each of his followers to drink presumably poisoned beverages. When they do so, Kai reveals that the drinks were untainted after everyone else has finished their cup. Ally and Ivy intend to pick up Oz at school and flee but discover that he was picked up earlier by Winter. They frantically drive to the Anderson home to find Oz unharmed. Kai claims that he was the donor whose sperm inseminated Ally when she became pregnant with Oz. Ivy insists that Oz should stay with Kai, his purported father, for the time being. Back at home, Ally prepares dinner for Ivy and confronts her for attempting to gain sole custody of Oz with the aid of Kai and his cult. Ivy scoffs at Ally's threats of retaliation and warns her that she will revert to her old skittish ways but Ally had laced the pasta and wine Ivy has been consuming with arsenic. As Ivy begins succumbing to the poison, Ally notes that murdering her is an act of retribution that will remedy her phobias. The next day, Ally arrives at a fertility clinic and manages to acquire the records of Oz's sperm donor. She then bribes the clinic worker to falsify the file.

Symptoms of secondary trauma are similar to those of PTSD (e.g. intrusive re-experiencing of the traumatic material, avoidance of trauma triggers/emotions, negative changes in beliefs and feelings and hyperarousal). Secondary trauma has been researched in first responders, nurses and physicians, mental health care workers, and children of traumatized parents.  Affected populations  Mental health care workers/social workers Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS) impacts many individuals in the mental health field and as of 2013 the prevalence rates for STS amongst different professions is as follows: 15.2% among social workers, 16.3% in oncology staff, 19% in substance abuse counselors, 32.8% in emergency nurses, 34% in child protective services workers, and 39% in juvenile justice education workers There is a strong correlation between burnout and secondary traumatic stress among mental health care professionals who are indirectly exposed to trauma and there are a multitude of different risk factors that contribute to the likelihood of developing secondary traumatic stress amongst individuals who conduct therapy with trauma victims. Workers who have had a history of trauma are more likely to develop STS. Additionally, individuals who have less work support as well as less social support are at higher risk for developing STS. Lastly, as the number of patients seen by these workers increases, so do the chances of developing STS. Some of the protective factors for mental health care workers include years of experience in the profession, more time spent in self-care activities and high self-efficacy. First responders Studies explain how secondary traumatic stress can negatively impact job performance in first responders which can lead to adverse outcomes not only for the first responders, but for the victims they seek to help. Job context is a greater risk factor for developing STS in first responders compared to the job content. This highlights the need for strategies targeted toward the organizational and systemic level in addition to the individual level. Organizational changes that can be addressed include work culture, workload, group support, supervision and education, and the modification of the work environment. Changes in these areas would foster resiliency for developing STS. Nurses and physicians Similarly, research highlights the importance of psychological services for nurses and medical professionals. Services similar to the ones listed above for the first responder population were valuable for reducing secondary traumatic stress symptoms amongst medical staff working with traumatic populations in hospital settings. Children of traumatized parents Van Ijzendoorn et al. (2003) conducted a meta-analysis of 32 studies with 4,418 participants in which they explored secondary trauma in children of Holocaust survivors. The authors found that in non-clinical studies no evidence of secondary traumatization, while clinical studies only showed evidence for secondary traumatization when additional stressors were also present. Intergenerational trauma or transgenerational trauma is also applied to describe the process by which parental traumatic experiences may lead to secondary trauma symptoms in their offspring, when additional stressors, such as war, famine, or displacement are present. Refugee children who are exposed to these additional stressors display heightened anxiety levels, and have an increased likelihood of experiencing traumatic life events, compared with non-refugee children in the United States. Sex differences There are also gender differences in the prevalence and vulnerability of secondary trauma. Research suggests that women are more likely than men to develop secondary traumatization. Additionally, not only are women more susceptible to experience the symptoms of STS, but they experience symptoms of STS at a greater intensity compared to men. It is theorized that this discrepancy may be due to women being more empathetic, more reactive to other people's emotions and are more likely to have caretaker burden. The greater the connection is with another individual while hearing their traumatic experience, the greater the likelihood of developing STS. Lastly, STS symptoms are consistent with what previous research has shown to be true regarding gender differences in PTSD symptomology.  Measurements  Secondary Trauma Self-Efficacy (STSE) Scale is a seven-item measure used to assess a person's beliefs about their ability to cope with barriers associated with secondary traumatic stress. The STSE measures one's \\"ability to cope with the challenging demands resulting from work with traumatized clients and perceived ability to deal with the secondary traumatic stress symptoms\\". In addition this the STSE, there is the STSS. The Secondary Trauma Stress Scale (STSS), is a 17-item questionnaire that measures the frequency of secondary traumatic stress symptoms over the past month. Questions on the STSS addresses issues with intrusion, avoidance and arousal symptoms similar to those found in PTSD. Interventions Phipps and Byrne (2003) detail some potential treatments for STS based on the premise that STS and PTSD symptomology are similar in nature. Some brief interventions for STS include critical incident stress debriefing (CISD), critical incident stress management (CISM) and stress inoculation training (SIT). CISD is a one session exposure-based intervention aimed at reducing distress by having the client recall and explain the traumatic event to a group and a facilitator 48‚Äì72 hours after the traumatic incident. The facilitator then provides education on the reasons for the symptoms and processes of trauma in a safe environment. The seven-phase debriefing technique includes: 1. Introduction, 2. Expectations and facts, 3. Thoughts and impressions, 4. Emotional reactions, 5. Normalization, 6. Future planning/coping and 7. Disengagement. This has been shown by multiple studies to have damaging effects on the survivors and actually exacerbates the trauma symptoms present. CISM is another one session exposure-based intervention aimed at reducing distress by having the client recall and explain the traumatic event but has a follow up component. CISM consists of 3 phases: 1. Pre-trauma training, 2. Debriefing and 3. Individual follow-up. CISM differs from CISD in the sense that two components are added and believed to be the driving factors for symptom reduction in individuals with STS. Firstly, the pre-trauma training of Stress Inoculation training is implemented and secondly the follow-up assessments after one month. SIT is a type of training that uses skills to lower autonomic arousal when exposed to the traumatic material. These techniques include muscle relaxation training, breathing retraining, covert self-dialogue and thought stopping. SIT provides skills to reduce trauma symptoms whereas CISD does not. These learned skills are imperative when faced with trauma symptoms and have been shown to be the most helpful type of intervention. It is recommended to implement both pre and post interventions in order to provide the best care. Bercier and Maynard (2015) explain that, to date, there is no empirical evidence to support effectiveness of interventions for mental health care workers (psychologists, social workers, counselors and therapists) who experience symptoms of STS. Although there is no empirical support for the efficacy of these interventions, there still are some interventions that are recommended for reducing symptoms of STS. Accelerated Recovery Program (ARP) has been specifically designed to treat symptoms of STS. ARP is a five-session program aimed to reduce negative arousal states that result from STS. Primary focus of STS symptom reduction has been at the individual level, but some interventions to reduce STS symptoms have been proposed at the organizational level. These organizational interventions include the provision of supervision, workshops and supportive organizational culture. Similar concepts Secondary trauma is often used interchangeably with several terms that have similar meanings including compassion fatigue, vicarious trauma, and job burnout. Although there is an overlap in terminology, there are nuanced differences. Compassion fatigue Compassion fatigue refers to a reduced capacity to help as a health care professional after being exposed to the suffering and distress of their patients. Secondary traumatic stress was later renamed compassion fatigue in 1995 by Charles Figley who described compassion fatigue as the natural emotions that arise as a result of learning about a significant others' experience with a traumatic event. Overall, compassion fatigue is often used interchangeably with secondary traumatic stress but the difference between the two is that STS is specific to individuals who treat traumatized populations whereas CF generalizes to individuals who treat an array of other populations. Vicarious trauma Vicarious traumatization (VT) is defined as a transformation of a helper's inner experience that is a result of empathic engagement with a client's traumatic experiences. This engagement with the client results in a shift in the cognitive schemas about oneself, the world, others. Vicarious trauma is similar to secondary traumatic stress, but individuals with VT display only one subtype characteristic of PTSD, negative changes in beliefs and feelings. VT fails to address other subtypes of PTSD symptoms (i.e. re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal). Job burnout Research describes job burnout as the burnout of an individual as a resultant of additive stress and lack of accomplishment in the workplace leading to poorer work performance. The concept of job burnout was originally developed to assess negative consequences of work-related exposure to a broad range of stressful situations experienced by human services employees. Job burnout is considered a symptom of STS, but STS is not a symptom of job burnout.

Early life and education  He was born in Boston on November 17, 1795, one of nine children of Captain Gamaliel Bradford and Elizabeth Hickling Bradford. At the age of 12 he spent nine months as a student in a Catholic seminary in Messina. He entered Harvard University in 1810 and was graduated in 1814. He was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. While studying medicine, he worked as a private tutor and as an assistant teacher at the Boston Latin School. His studies were interrupted in 1818 by a life-threatening bout of typhus. In 1819 he went to the University of Edinburgh to complete his education, returning in the spring of 1820.  Career  From 1821 to 1827, Bradford practiced medicine in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts. In the mid-1820s he taught physiology. In 1827, he gave up practicing medicine and became the manager of a large South Boston brewery. He left the brewery in 1833, and a few months later was appointed Superintendent of Massachusetts General Hospital.  Abolitionism  Bradford attended the founding meeting of the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1832, but did not become a member. He was put off by William Lloyd Garrison's manner and thought his insistence on immediate emancipation was unrealistic. In 1835, however, when Boston's political leaders tried to pass legislation silencing Garrison and other local abolitionists, Bradford published an open letter in the Courier in which he defended the abolitionists' Constitutional rights to free speech and assembly. The letter was later reprinted as a pamphlet. He argued that the abolitionists had as much right to try to influence public opinion as supporters of the Temperance movement, and noted that Benjamin Franklin had signed an anti-slavery resolution in 1790. Early in 1836, leaders of the Society met with state legislators to try to persuade them not to suppress their activities \\"by political fiat.\\" Bradford joined Samuel Joseph May, Samuel Edmund Sewall, and Charles Follen, and made a speech in defense of abolitionism that was described in the Liberator as \\"eloquent, thrilling, and impassioned.\\" Bradford argued that the abolitionists' activities were in keeping with international, constitutional, and moral law. In support of his third point, he cited Biblical law: > I come last to the moral law. The abolitionists, as we all do, Sir, look for > the moral law in the Bible ‚Äî they hold that the law and prophets hang from > the precept \\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\\" \\"But who,\\" says their > opposer, \\"is my neighbor?\\" In answer to that question, Bradford then cited the Parable of the Good Samaritan. The abolitionists won this particular battle, and in January 1837, the Massachusetts House of Representatives voted to allow the Anti-Slavery Society to use their hall.  Personal life  Bradford was an advocate of temperance, pacifism, and strict Sabbatarianism. He was a mentor to Ralph Waldo Emerson. In his spare time he enjoyed writing essays and reviews, which were published widely in journals such as the Boston Spectator, the New England Journal, the New-England Magazine, the North American Review, and the Christian Examiner. In March 1821, Bradford married Sophia Rice, daughter of Colonel Nathan Rice. He had a son, also named Gamaliel Bradford (1831-1911). He began having epileptic seizures in 1832. The attacks grew more frequent every year. In 1838 he embarked on a four-month Mediterranean cruise, hoping it would improve his health, but it had little effect. On October 22, 1830, at the age of 44, he had an unusually severe seizure and died. From 1833 to 1839, Bradford kept a diary which contains many accounts of conversations with people such as John Quincy Adams, William Ellery Channing, Edward Everett, John Gorham Palfrey, Charles Russell Lowell, Sr., and Judge Lemuel Shaw. The four unpublished volumes are kept at the Houghton Library, Harvard University.

In the same year, he published his first collection, Mukhoreul aneunga (Î¨µÌò∏Î•º ÏïÑÎäîÍ∞Ä Do You Know Mukho), and later published more collections such as Myeongokheon (Î™ÖÏò•Ìóå) and Tteollim (Îñ®Î¶º The Trembling). After 2006 he took a hiatus, and in 2013 he returned to the literary world with the web novel Nappeun bom (ÎÇòÏÅú Î¥Ñ Bad Spring) published on Naver, which happens to be his first novel. He has won the 46th Hyundae Literary Award, and the 6th Kim Yujung Literary Award.  Life  Sim Sang-dae was born in 1960 Gangneung, Gangwondo. He graduated from Gangneung Jeil High School and Korea University in archaeology & art history. As a peculiar background in his career, he had changed his pen name twice. At first, he had used his real name ‚ÄòSim Sang- dae‚Äô, but as he published his serial story Tteollim (Îñ®Î¶º The Trembling) in 2000, he changed his pen name to ‚ÄòMarsyas Sim‚Äô. He has said that this was to show his aspiration to ‚Äòbe bold in front of art, just like the artist in the legend who attempted to contest Apollo, the son of Zeus, in the arts‚Äô.\\"Where There is No 'I' But Just 'We'...

Retrieved July 28, 2017. From the time of publishing Nappeun bom (ÎÇòÏÅú Î¥Ñ Bad Spring), he is using his real name again.  Writing  Sim Sang-dae's most distinguished characteristic is his ability to balance aesthetic stance and narrative completion. From his three debut works, \\"Myosachong\\" (Î¨òÏÇ¨Ï¥ù A Description), \\"Mukhoreul aneunga\\" (Î¨µÌò∏Î•º ÏïÑÎäîÍ∞Ä Do You Know Mukho), and \\"Suchaehwa gamsang\\" (ÏàòÏ±ÑÌôî Í∞êÏÉÅ Looking at Watercolor Paintings), he is said to have \\"shown very different looks in terms of the actual story in each work, despite all of them showing excellent sense of language and technical skill\\".Lee, Dong-ha, \\"The Alchemist and the Storyteller\\", Mukhoreul aneunga, Munhakdongne, 2001. In his first collection that was published in 1990, Mukhoreul aneunga (Î¨µÌò∏Î•º ÏïÑÎäîÍ∞Ä Do You Know Mukho), there are 11 stories that each has a different color. These are such as \\"Myosachong\\" (Î¨òÏÇ¨Ï¥ù A Description) and \\"Gang\\" (Í∞ï The River), which have strong aestheticism; \\"Huibokssiui Budongsan\\" (Ìù¨Î≥µÏî®Ïùò Î∂ÄÎèôÏÇ∞ The Real Estate of Miss Huibok) and \\"Yagobui oechul\\" (ÏïºÍ≥±Ïùò Ïô∏Ï∂ú Jacob's Outing), which are categorized under realism; \\"Mukhoreul aneunga\\" (Î¨µÌò∏Î•º ÏïÑÎäîÍ∞Ä Do You Know Mukho), which has a lyrical tone; \\"Mondeuriangwa roseukoreul wihan guseong\\" (Î™¨ÎìúÎ¶¨ÏïàÍ≥º Î°úÏä§ÏΩîÎ•º ÏúÑÌïú Íµ¨ÏÑ± The Composition for Mondrian and Roscoe), which shows experimental form and composition; and \\"Yangpungjeon\\" (ÏñëÌíçÏ†Ñ), which bases itself on deep exploration of the story itself.Munhakdongne Website. Retrieved July 28, 2017. For that, critic Kang Sang-hui, who had given commentary on Sim Sang-dae's second collection Myeongokheon (Î™ÖÏò•Ìóå), has called Sim Sang-dae as the \\"storytelling aestheticist.\\"Kang, Sang-hui, \\"The Age of Wandering of a Storytelling Aestheticist\\", Myeongokheon, Munhakdongne, 2001. Sim Sang-dae's works either have different tones from one another, or there are cases where in one work there is a coexistence of elements of different tones. However, it is not that there isn't an element that permeates through all of his works. In general, he portrays a longing for life where people truly bond with each other, where people live with dignity, a world before civilization and the order of reason, where the vigorous and wild breath of life unique to humans still live and breathe. And he has continued this toward works such as the serial Tteollim (Îñ®Î¶º The Trembling), which deals with indulgence of wild sexuality, or Nappeun bom (ÎÇòÏÅú Î¥Ñ Bad Spring),\\"Where There is No 'I' But Just 'We'...

Teresito \\"Chito\\" Suganob (August 1, 1960 ‚Äì July 22, 2020) was a Filipino Roman Catholic priest based in Marawi. He came into national public attention when he was taken hostage by ISIL-linked Maute group militants during the earlier period of the Battle of Marawi in May 2017. Suganob was a native of Lambunao, Iloilo. Career Suganob served as a priest at the Prelature of Marawi which serves both the city of Marawi and the province of Lanao del Norte. He was assigned at the Cathedral of Maria Auxiliadora. He worked with the Institute for Peace and Development in Mindanao along with Moctar Matuan, the organization's executive director, in monitoring governance in different municipalities. He also helped Henrietta de Villa in establishing a foothold for the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting in Lanao del Sur as well as in aiding victims of human trafficking in the province. He served as the Vicar General of Marawi, the right hand of Marawi Bishop Edwin dela Pe√±a. During Suganob‚Äôs early years of service in Marawi as a priest, Muslims were suspicious of the Prelature of Marawi's attempts to establish a dialogue between Muslims and Christians. According to Bishop dela Pe√±a, when the September 11 attacks occurred in the United States, there was a greater need for Muslims to assert Islam as a \\"religion of peace\\" and said that this need is an opportunity for Muslims and Christians to \\"work together\\". The bishop described the timing of Soganub's arrival in Marawi as \\"just at the right moment\\". Suganob also conducted programs in chaplaincy, education, interfaith dialogue and peace building at the Mindanao State University. Captivity in Marawi Amidst a battle between ISIL-linked Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups, and government forces in Marawi which commenced in May 2017, Chito Suganob was taken hostage along with 23 others by the Maute group at the Cathedral of Maria Auxiliadora on the eve of May 23, 2017 while they were preparing for a celebration of the Feast of Mary Help of Christians which was to take place on the next day. The church was later burned by the militants. Within the month, he appeared in a propaganda video pleading to President Rodrigo Duterte for his life as well as the lives of reportedly hundreds of others. He also echoed the demands of his captors to withdraw government forces from Marawi. He, along with other hostages were fed by the militants with food from grocery stores but their captors experienced a shortage as fighting increased. The hostages, Suganob included, were forcibly converted to Islam. Suganob also narrated how he was tasked to transport arms for the militants which were to be used against government troops. According to a self-narrated account relayed to Bishop dela Pena, Suganob along with a Dansalan College teacher who was also taken hostage escaped early morning of September 17, 2017 from their captors and were found by the military who rescued them near the Bato Ali mosque. According to Presidential Peace Adviser Secretary Jesus Dureza, his companion and himself were rescued late night of September 16 following a military operation. President Rodrigo Duterte said that Suganob was not released as a result of backdoor negotiations with militants answering to queries by the media. Life after escape Following his escape and rescue, he took a rest from his duties as priest. His programs and services at the Mindanao State University were handled by seconded priests and lay missionaries from the Redemptorist Missionaries in the Philippines, Caritas Cebu, and the Capiz Archdiocesan Social Action Center in Roxas City. On September 18, 2017, military and defence officials officially presented Suganob to the media at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City. After undergoing trauma healing Soganub was not given a new assignment or did he return to Marawi to continue his missionary work. He spent the later years of his life as a speaker sharing his experience in Marawi as a hostage by the Maute group. Religious views Soganub made an effort to respect the way of living of Marawi's Muslim population. He avoided the public display of a crucifix including at the former Cathedral of Maria Auxiliadora and remarked that the cross is \\"planted deep in our hearts\\" as a compromise to \\"avoid arguments and to avoid further misunderstandings\\". After his escape from the Maute, he reaffirmed his belief in good interfaith relations between Muslims and Christians. He also expressed his views on the similarities of Christianity and Islam believing that both adherents of the religion follow one God, the desire to live in peace, and the belief in the afterlife with Muslims believing that they can go to paradise while Christians believe in heaven. He always said that he still associated himself with Christians rather than with Muslims while expressing these beliefs. The legitimacy of his conversion was dismissed. Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Assemblyman Zia Alonto Adiong said that forced conversions are prohibited in Islam. Marawi Bishop Dela Pena said there was no confirmation of the conversion. He also added that such cannot be considered a \\"full conversion\\" when the act was done under duress and remarked that the Prelature of Marawi had not \\"abandoned\\" him. Personal life Suganob was reportedly fluent in speaking the Maranao language. He maintained long hair and a beard as an effort to not alienate himself from Muslim ulamas who maintain their beards. As a result he was often mistaken as a Muslim. He also did not wear a crucifix or a cleric collar.  Death  Suganob died from cardiac arrest on July 22, 2020 in his residence in Norala, South Cotabato. His remains were buried in the same town's public cemetery.https://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2020/08/fr-chito-soganub- marawi-siege-survivor-laid-to-rest/ References 1960 births 2020 deaths Hiligaynon people Filipino Roman Catholic priests Place of birth missing Filipino people taken hostage People from Iloilo Victims of Islamic terrorism ","title":"Chito Soganub"},{"id":"55291743","text":"Ga√´l L√©vecque (born 23 November 1994) is a French male high jumper, who won an individual gold medal at the Youth World Championships.

He plays electric and acoustic guitar, and is associated with the American Primitive Guitar genre through his collaboration with steel string guitarist John Fahey. He is a member of the Oregon Music Hall of Fame and Cascade Blues Association Hall of Fame, and was honored with the eponymous \\"Terry Robb\\" Muddy Award for Best Acoustic Guitar in 2011. His original compositions draw on the Delta blues, ragtime, folk music, country music and jazz traditions.  Biography   Early life and career  Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Robb moved to the United States with his parents, living briefly in Pittsburgh, Pa., before settling in Portland, Ore., at the age of seven. He was immersed in music and the arts at an early age, and received his first guitar at age eight from an uncle who played swing guitar and was associated with the Lawrence Welk Orchestra. During the blues revival of the 1960s, he was exposed to blues, country, ragtime and early jazz musicians that were being rediscovered, as well as contemporary jazz and blues rock musicians, which led to a lifelong interest in the blues and Americana music. He began performing in bands at age 12, playing dances at local junior high and high schools, and was soon after performing solo sets in coffee houses around Portland. Following his graduation from Parkrose High School in 1974, he studied fine arts and music theory under Czech-American classical composer Tom√°≈° Svoboda at Portland State University before receiving his baccalaureate degree in 1978.Curran, Tim. \\"Terry Robb inducted into Oregon Music Hall of Fame\\", The Mid County Memo, Oct 2009.

When Vestine later moved to Oregon, Robb helped him get established in the local music scene, and occasionally joined on guitar during Canned Heat's Pacific Northwest performances.Limnios, Michalis. \\"Guitarist/ songwriter/ producer Terry Robb talks about Canned Heat, John Fahey, his label PsycheDelta, & Buddy Guy.\\" Blues.Gr.

It used a hierarchy of clandestine cells, in which each member would oversee a cell on the next level. The first cell was labeled A; the next tier B; then C, and so forth. The ABC gained prominence quickly through dissemination of propaganda and through acts of terrorism. The group accepted the invitation of US Ambassador Sumner Welles to participate in a new government, only to be forced out of power in less than a month, becoming again an opposition group during the One Hundred Days Government.  Founding  The ABC was founded in October 1931 by a group that had been meeting for a year in the office of Dr. Juan Andr√©s Lliteras. The most prominent member was Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez Saenz. Jorge Ma√±ach and Francisco Ichaso were soon invited to join.Aguilar (1972), pp. 118‚Äì121. The group's membership was predominantly middle class, including students and professionals.Whitney (2001), p. 78. \\"The ABC was created by disgruntled followers of the UN after the R√≠o Verde events. Many middle-class Cubans hoped that the new organization would represent their aspirations for both modern economic development and political stability. Yet the failure of the traditional politicians to bring down Machado in 1931 drove many otherwise moderate people to support terrorist actions to bring down the dictator. The new organization quickly developed a mass following, especially among young professionals and students.\\" Cells had about seven members, each of whom could lead a cell on the tier below. Members of the organization knew only their leader and the cell below them. The system of alphabetical lettering of cells from tier to tier gave the organization its name. A sequence of numbers along with the letter identified each individual member. The members of cell A were numbered A1, A2, A3, etc. They gave their number as the first digit used in the next cell; the cell led by A3 would have members B31, B32, B33, etc.Alfredo Jos√© Estrada, Havana: Autobiography of a City; ; pp. 173‚Äì174.  Terrorism  The organization took credit for numerous terrorist attacks like assassinations and bombings. They targeted police officers and soldiers, and also made several high-profile killings, including Senate President Clemente V√°zquez Bello. The ABC reportedly orchestrated a plan to kill Machado by bombing Vazequez Bello's funeral, but failed due to a last-minute change of cemetery. In early 1932 the government created a secret police force called the Porra, which acted against the opposition with no less violence.Aguilar (1972), pp. 125‚Äì126. This repression further weakened the Machado government and enhanced the ABC's standing.Jules R. Benjamin, \\"The Machadato and Cuban Nationalism, 1928‚Äì1932\\", Hispanic American Historical Review 55(1), February 1975, pp. 79‚Äì80. \\"The ABC was known not so much for its ideology, however, as for its tactics‚Äîurban terrorism. Its bomb attacks against well-known figures of the regime and its police apparatus (mainly carried out by student members) made ABC a popular symbol of the revolt against Machado. Moreover, the retributive torture and assassination against these sons and daughters of the Cuban middle class by the agents of the Machadato destroyed the cohesion of the bourgeoisie, splitting that portion of it desiring the overthrow of the regime from that which‚Äîfor fear of the consequences‚Äîstill supported the President. \\" The ABC maintained close contact with Cuba's radical student group, the Directorio Estudiantil Universitario. Student leader Eduardo Chib√°s wrote that students sometimes carried out the bombing missions, with the ABC providing funding and equipment, and also taking credit.Jaime Suchlicki, \\"Stirrings of Cuban Nationalism: The Student Generation of 1930\\"; Journal of Inter-American Studies 10(3), July 1968; JSTOR.  Manifesto and ideology ABC insignia as it appears on the 1932 program-manifesto In 1932, the ABC issued a Program Manifesto, written predominantly by Mart√≠nez Saenz, Ma√±ach, and Ichaso. The Manifesto called for a range of reforms, including women's suffrage, worker's rights (unions, eight-hour day, right to strike, pensions), the elimination of latifundios through taxation, and the creation of cooperatives. It also called for the creation of a Cuban National Bank.Whitney (2001), p. 85. \\"The ABC supported rural cooperative societies, which would be aided by an Agricultural Bank. Cuba did not have a national bank, so the ABC's program called for formation of such an institution, which could provide credit to small and medium-sized producers and businesses.\\" Though wide- ranging, the ABC's program has been described as more pragmatic or realistic than those of other opposition groups at the time.Geoff Simons, Cuba: From Conquistador to Castro; Hampshire & London: Macmillan, 1996; ; p. 245. The ABC was sometimes criticized (especially by the Communist Party of Cuba) as fascist, elitist, or crypto-imperialist.Whitney (2001), pp. 84‚Äì85. \\"The ABC's program opposed the politics of class struggle. Instead, they tried to build a multiclass and mass insurrectionary movement favoring a 'new Cuba' based on national capitalist development. Their program was corporatist and protofascist. Corporatist movements were a response to the development of a mass workforce and the creation of new urban social classes; corporatists wanted to work out ways to control and manage the process of rapid social class formation while guaranteeing capitalist development. [...] The ABC's view of the new Cuba was elitist. They believed that the Cuban people were not ready for liberal democracy and that state intervention, directed by an intellectual elite, was required to prepare Cubans to assume their civil responsibilities. At the same time, the ABC Manifesto stated that the organization was opposed to both fascism and communism because both ideologies contradicted the principles of political liberty.\\"Yusleidy P√©rez S√°nchez, \\"Ma√±ach, el ABC y el proceso revolucionario del 30 en Cuba \\"; Perfiles de la Cultura Cubana 01, January‚ÄìApril 2008. The British Ambassador John J. Broderick related his \\"surprise to hear university professors and lawyers and doctors of education and intelligence attempt to justify the nightly bombings in the capital and its surroundings, on the grounds that they serve to keep alive amongst the people a spirit of uneasiness and revolt until comprehensive plans have been prepared for a series of systematic direct attacks on the machinery of the Government.\\"Whitney (2001), p. 86. The ABC itself declared its opposition to both communism and fascism. Its green banner contrasted notably with the gray, black, and blue colors of contemporary European right- wing groups, and its logo inspired by the Jewish star was intended to connote persecution.  Regime changes of 1933‚Äì1934  By early 1933 the ABC had reached its peak popularity, and its green flag was reportedly flown widely. Apparently contrary to its stance against American interventionism, the ABC accepted a seat at the table in negotiations with American ambassador Sumner Welles, prompting the creation of a more rigidly anti-interventionist splinter group called ABC Radical. ABC's participation gave credibility to the negotiations, and by twice threatening to withdraw the organization was able to effect release of its imprisoned members, thanks to pressure by Welles on Machado.Aguilar (1972), pp. 133‚Äì140. Welles wrote of the ABC in a telegram to Washington on 1 July 1933, \\"the representatives of that organization are both intelligent and well-disposed and I am hopeful that for some weeks at least the organization can be kept in line.\\"837.00/3567: Telegram, Foreign Relations of the United States, Diplomatic Paper, 1933, The American Republics, Volume 5. Quoted in Philip Dur & Christopher Gilcrease, \\"US Diplomacy and the Downfall of a Cuban Dictator: Machado in 1933\\"; Journal of Latin American Studies 34(2), May 2002; JSTOR. When, amidst a general strike in Havana, Welles succeeded in pressuring Machado to resign, the ABC requested four cabinet positions in the new government of Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes y Quesada. It got two: Mart√≠nez Saenz as Secretary of the Treasury, and Carlos Saladrigas y Zayas as Secretary of Justice.Aguilar (1972), p. 154. The C√©spedes government was displaced by the Sergeants' Revolt of 4 September 1933. One of the plotters, Fulgencio Batista, was an ABC member, but had not secured the help of his comrades in the government.Aguilar (1972), pp. 160‚Äì161. In November 1933 the ABC participated in an unsuccessful revolt against the One Hundred Days Government headed by Ramon Grau. Despite the chaos of the times, many groups including ABC Radical, the Communist Party, and eventually the armed forces under Batista fought on the side of the government. The rebels retreated to Atar√©s Castle, where they held out for a few hours then surrendered. This defeat, and the ABC's confused explanation of its motives for the revolt, dealt a permanent blow to the group's credibility.Aguilar (1972), pp. 195‚Äì197.  Decline and disbandment  The ABC continued as a political party but saw its influence steadily dwindle. The group took part in the Constitutional Assembly of 1940, along with other several parties of the time. It disbanded in 1952, after a new coup by Batista. Numismatic connection In 1934 a new silver peso was introduced. Secretary of the Treasury Saenz was a member of ABC and suggested it be named after the group. Since then collectors have used that term for the coin. Footnotes  References   Sources  * Aguilar, Luis E. (1972). Cuba 1933: Prologue to Revolution.

In the wake of the Great Depression, Schram helped restore confidence in investment and stocks. Before his appointment, Schram did not own any stocks and had never been a Wall Street trader, making him the first outsider to become president of the exchange in 155 years. Early life Schram was born in Peru, Indiana where he attended local schools through high-school. He was accepted into Harvard and Wharton, but couldn't afford tuition. Instead, he went to work in a timber and coal company with local offices. At age 21 he proved himself to be an effective farm manager, making investment decisions that dramatically increased the output of a local farm under the firms control., Career Schram's early success in farm management led him accept a position as chairman of the National Drainage Association, an agricultural trade group. While working for the Association, Schram applied for loans with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation which was a Depression/New Deal era government corporation tasked with making loans to infrastructure projects and businesses and helping banks resume normal operations. In 1933, Schram joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. In 1939 he became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the RFC.Preliminary inventory of the records of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, 1932‚Äì1964 (PI 181, Record Group 173), National Archives and Records Service, 1973. His chairmanship was short lived, however, because less than two years later he was offered the position that would define his career. In 1941 the New York Stock Exchange was still feeling the effects of the Great Depression. Trade volume was very low, seats were sold cheaper than in previous decades, and the exchange had been the target of political attacks. A selection committee was formed to find a new president, and they selected Schram. Before his appointment, Schram did not own any stocks and had never been a Wall Street trader, making him the first outsider to become president of the exchange in 155 years. Schram reformed the management structure of the Exchange, removing many of the traditional committees in favor of a top-town approach. He spent $500,000 per year on nationwide advertising programs encouraging the public to hold on to war bonds in an effort to keep small-time investors out of the market. Under Schram's leadership, the NYSE recovered, and public confidence was restored. Later career In 1951, at age 58, Schram retired from the Exchange and returned home to Peru, Indiana. Schram was succeeded by G. Keith Funston. In his later life he remained active in civic organizations including the local council of the Boy Scouts of America and the U.S.O. Personal life Emil Schram's first wife was Mabel Miller, with whom he had three sons, Robert Schram, Daniel Schram, and James Schram. Mabel died in 1969, and Schram later married Margaret Beauchamp. Schram died in 1987 in Peru, Indiana. Honors In 1968, Emil Schram was awarded an honorary doctorate from Indiana University, Bloomington.

The earliest house here was built before 1485, and Mathafarn plays a significant role in Welsh and English history.  History  The earliest reference to Mathafarn is in 1485. Henry Tudor was travelling through Wales to meet Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field, when he stopped at Mathafarn Hall, near Machynlleth and consulted with the poet Dafydd Llwyd (c1420 to c1500) who lived at the hall. Llwyd was made an esquire following Henry's decisive victory at the Battle of Bosworth. Around 1600, the house was owned by Richard ap John ap Hugh, a descendant of Llwyd. Hugh's son Rowland Pugh was the Lord of Meirionedd, and in 1624, was elected as the MP for Cardigan. In 1625, he was re-elected to the seat, and appointed as High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire. In 1628 he built a new house at Mathafarn. Pugh supported the Royalist side in the English Civil War. On 2 November 1644, Sir Thomas Myddleton of the Parliamentarian army was marching through the Dyfi valley when he was ambushed by a force organised by Pugh. In retaliation for the attack, Myddleton burned down Mathafarn on 29 November 1644. Rowland Pugh died at Christmas 1644; his son John Pugh was made Lord of Cyfeiliog at the Restoration in recognition of his father's support of the Monarchy. Another house was built at Mathafarn towards the end of the 17th century, and was sold to Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn in 1752. Wynn's son Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 5th Baronet built a new house at Mathafarn around 1800. By 1859, Williams-Winn had moved out of Mathafarn and had leased the house to William Owen. In 1915, Mathafarn was in possession of Edward Hughes who was a county alderman and magistrate of Montgomeryshire. The house built in 1800 still stands in 2017.  Location  Mathafarn is located half a mile north- west of Cemmaes Road and a similar distance east of Llanwrin. It stands at the confluence of the Afon Ceirig and the Afon Dyfi.

The village is bordered by Yue Stream () in the east, Houdayuan Stream () in the south, and Jiufeng Mountain () in the west. The village was formerly known as Fenglinzhuang' () or \\"Maple Forest Village\\" and changed to the current name due to its \\"wind and water favourable\\" location, according to the principles of fengshui characteristics.  Architecture  Shangjing still preserves more than 50 ancient houses and 20 historic grand halls that can be dated back to Ming and Qing Dynasties. The village‚Äôs buildings are of a typical Wu-style and feature white walls, black tiles ornate wooden cornices, high doors, and lattice windows. Its wood carvings and tile carvings are typical elements of ancient Chinese architecture. Among them is the provincially unique five-room ancestral hall, known as Lui Clan Ancestral Hall, and six other architectural sites: Baishun Hall, Liuji Hall, Qianji Hall, Xizhen Lane, and Folk House 48 (the Upstairs Hall).

The whole building is a south oriented three-hall construction covering an area of nearly 3000 square meters. Having a grand door lintel and delicately-carved wooden brackets, the hall assumes an architectural style that is quite rare in the province and earns it the reputation of the main Ancestral Temple of Tangxi. Liu Clan Ancestral Hall is one of the ‚Äútwo and half ancestral halls‚Äù widely known in Jinhua. The complex has been listed as a ‚ÄúProvincial Cultural Relics Protection Unit‚Äù in Zhejiang.  Screen Wall of Auspiciousness  Screen Wall of Auspiciousness () The screen wall is a brick construction consisting of a pedestal, a body, a top and a Chinese character \\"\\" (, meaning \\"blessing\\") in the middle. Screen walls of auspiciousness like this were very popular in the Ming Dynasty (1368 ‚Äì 1644) and acted as screen against the penetration of wind and evil and the dissipation of qi. On the right side of the wall is a deer, which in Chinese is homophonic to \\"\\" () meaning \\"wealth\\". On the left side is a crane implying longevity. These carvings together with peaches and old men around the wall and on four corners convey a wish of auspiciousness, wealth, and longevity.  Chengqi Hall Site  Chengqi Hall Site () Chengqi Hall was built in the early Ming Dynasty. \\"\\" () means \\"taking over from the past and setting a new course for the future; glorifying forefathers and enriching posterity\\". It was said that Chengqi Hall was built by the eldest (Liu Fushigong) of three brothers, who belong to the Fu generation of Liu clan. The building is structurally compact and delicate, using brick beams and columns near the wall of the hall. So the hall is also known as brick hall. Now only the eastern rooms remain.  Lamei Hall  Lamei Hall () The whole building faces south and has two storeys. With the gate, hallways and back room co-axially arranged, the first floor is wide and bright and used for the display and sales of food and local specialties. The second floor is clean and spacious and offers an excellent view, and now is used as a lounge where visitors can watch all kinds of performances put on outside down on the ground.  Chongli Hall  Chongli Hall () Chongli Hall was initially built from 1457 to 1464. It is a three-hall construction facing south and located on the head of the boat-shaped village, and is characterized by a unique two-homocentric squares courtyard in the middle. The pond in front of the gate is called \\"Up Water Pond\\" (or Shangshui Pond), which together with the building forms a fengshui pattern called \\"Zhuque\\" (firebird) ‚Äì \\"Xuanwu\\" (dragon tortoise) (i.e. a spatial layout) and acts for fire prevention purpose.  Baishun Hall  Baishun Hall () Baishun Hall was initially built between 1403 and 1424, and is also known as Lower Hall. It was built by the second elder brother (Liu Fushiwugong) of three brothers who belong to the Fu generation of Liu clan, and has a history of 600 years. Oriented south, the whole building is a brick beam-column, three-hall three-courtyard construction, carrying a plain but lofty brick carving of \\"\\" () on the arch. The central bay has a removable stage, and rooms on the left and right sides are made into elevated balconies for high officials and noble lords to watch the performance do recreational activities. Large timber is used in the middle hall, with beams and columns up to 60 cm in diameter. The hall is three-room wide and nine-purlin deep, which was typical in Ming Dynasty. Baishun Hall is the biggest among the ‚Äú36 halls‚Äù so far preserved in Shangjing Village and appears on the list of Provincial Cultural Relics Protection Units.  Liuji Hall  Liuji Hall () Liuji Hall was built with the financial support of Liu Zhaogan, the Grand Preceptor of Emperor Jiaqing. The whole building is southwest oriented. It covers an area of 306m2, and appears on the list of Provincial Cultural Relics Protection Units. The lintel of the gate is engraved with \\"\\" () as well as various auspicious patterns. On the bottom left of the gate are horse and monkey carvings, implying quick promotion, and on the bottom right are deer and crane carvings, implying eternal prosperity. The hall is three-room wide and is connected with walls on both sides, and each wall has a side door to form a courtyard. Inside the hall preserved wood carvings with animate figures of characters, flowers and vases.  Tail Gate Tower  Tail Gate Tower () Tail Gate tower is one of the bridge galleries built over a street. In Shangjing Village, there are two kinds of gate towers, i.e. the Head Gate Tower and the Tail Gate Tower, both of which act together to connect two relatively independent houses and make them look integrated. With arches, \\"women needn‚Äôt walk on the road and shoes wont be dampened on a rainy day\\". They also provide a space for folks to chitchat. The Tail Gate Tower was built in Qianlong Period of the Qing Dynasty and has been listed as a Provincial Cultural Relics Protection Unit.  Yuanji Hall  Yuanji Hall () Yuanji Hall was built by Liu Weicheng, the grandfather of Liu Zhaogan. Because of the meritorious services by his grandson Liu Zhaogan, he was honored with the title of \\"Fengzhi Dafu\\" and granted the entitlement to Level-5 official welfare by order of Emperor Jiaqing. Yuanji Hall opens its gate to the west and was previously guarded with a pair of drum-shaped bearing stones (destroyed after liberation). The hall currently is a 3D experience house exhibiting fairy tales and legends from all around the world and offering visitors an extraordinary cultural experience.  Liu Zhaogan‚Äôs Former Residence  Liu Zhaogan‚Äôs Former Residence () Liu Zhaogan, who was nicknamed ‚ÄúWhite Duck‚Äù, earned his certified student title at the age of eight, the first-degree scholar title at the age of thirteen, and became the Grand Preceptor of the then-Prince Jiaqing during the Qianlong Period of the Qing Dynasty. The gate is wide, featuring wide head and narrow tail for the purpose of preventing dissipation of Qi. A pair of drum-shaped bearing stones, which was a typical indication of the architectural class and family status of dignitaries in the Qing Dynasty, is placed apart on both sides. The gate used to carry a plaque of \\"\\" () which is missing now. The central room is decorated with a caisson ceiling and lattices on doors and windows are also elaborately designed and carved. The sparrow braces above the gourd beam are carved with two animate goldfish, symbolizing auspiciousness and richness, and the beautiful lotus on the brackets implies the identity of the house owner.  Sutra Hall Site  Sutra Hall Site () Sutra Hall, also known as Fuqing Temple, was the place where natives prayed to Buddha for help. In addition to the statues of Maitreya Buddha, Weituo Bodhisattva, the Four Guardians, Avalokitesvara (or Guanyin), Tathagata, and the Eighteen Disciples of the Buddha, it used to enshrine the Goddess of Birth (whom ancient women frequently visited to pray for a son), Lord Guan, and God of Wealth. Four characters \\"\\" () are still faintly discernible above the lintel of the west door. Compared with the past prosperity, now only the ruins remain.

Gude Axelsen Giedde () (1510-1590) was a Norwegian military officer, Lutheran prelate, and provost in Kville, Bohusl√§n, then part of Norway. Biography Gude Axelsen Giedde was born in 1510 in Trondheim, Norway, as a son of Axel Giedde and Margareta Pedersdotter. His father, who was a lieutenant in Trondheim, is said to have lost his nobility due to marriage with a commoner, a daughter of a merchant.Are S. Gustavsen / Carl Fredric Rothlieb: Matrikel √∂ver dem av Svea Rikets Ridderskap och Adel, 1807, s 146 (https://books.google.com/books?id=XbkDAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA146) Gude married Johanna Pedersdotter, with whom he had at least three sons. It has been speculated that he was the great-grandson of :sv:Erengisle G√§dda of the Swedish noble family G√§dda from Sm√•land, Sweden, but this remains unattested. In any case, his family descendants were ennobled in the name of Gedda (n:o 2168) by King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden in 1797; he became the asserted primogenitor of this family.https://www.adelsvapen.com/genealogi/Gedda_nr_2168 In his youth he studied at the University of Wittenberg in Wittenberg, Holy Roman Empire, and became a follower and friend of Martin Luther with whom he often corresponded.C W Skarstedt: G√∂teborgs stifts herdaminne, 1882-85 When Giedde returned to Norway he became an officer. As a devoted adherent of Lutheranism, for his personal security during the tumultuous time of the Protestant Reformation, he is said to ridden his horse equipped with a sword and pistols. His sword was inherited down to his grandson Peder Jenssen, who however lost it in a fire.https://www.adelsvapen.com/genealogi/Gedda_nr_2168#TAB_1 The Danish- Norwegian King Christian III of Denmark was concerned about imposing the Protestant Reformation in his dominions and therefore needed clergy profoundly introduced in the Lutheran teachings. Giedde thus left his military career in order to become a priest. In 1534 he was appointed vicar in Kville, Bohusl√§n, then belonging to Norway, becoming the region's first Lutheran priest, succeeding the Catholic monk Gudmund. When Pehr Kalm visited Fj√§llbacka in 1742, he was told the story about how Gudmund went under and died due to the \\"Gudmund skerry\\" in the sea outside the port of Fj√§llbacka. Giedde remained vicar there until 1573, when he was appointed religious provost in Viken.Ragnar Kvillmark: Fyra g√•rdar, fyra sl√§kter i Norra Bohusl√§n, s 18 Due to his old age he had become blind when he was visited in Kville by King James VI of Scotland. He died in 1590 in Kville, in today's Tanum Municipality, Bohusl√§n, Sweden.

Buller was the son of James Buller and his second wife Lady Jane Bathurst daughter of Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst and was baptized on 28 February 1745. He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford on 18 January 1764. In the 1768 general election Buller was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Exeter on the corporation interest. He married Anne Lemon, daughter of William Lemon of Carclew and sister of Sir William Lemon, 1st Baronet on 3 April 1770. Some time before 1774, probably on the death of his half-brother James in 1772, Buller took over the management at West Looe constituency, where he was able to arrange the return of two Members. He also began interfering in other constituencies, not necessarily for his own return but to affect the outcome of the poll. In the 1774 general election he stood for Parliament at Cornwall and Launceston. He stood at Cornwall in order to draw votes away the opponents of his brother in law William Lemon and came third, but he was returned as MP at Launceston. After inheriting property at Saltash, he contested the borough in 1780, but only so could surrender it for the wardenship of the stannaries. He was defeated but petitioned, and a committee of the House of Commons decided against him only by the chairman‚Äôs casting vote. At the same time he was able to return himself as MP at West Looe. He resigned his seat there in 1782 and in 1783 he again contested Saltash but was defeated and had his petition rejected again. He returned himself briefly for West Looe when one of the members died in 1784. In the 1784 general election he stood at Exeter again and was defeated. His involvement at Saltash in the 1784 election was on behalf of John Lemon who after petitions and disputes about voting rights was eventually returned in 1787. In the 1790 general election Buller did not stand but was able to return Government supporters both at Saltash and at West Looe. He was appointed a commissioner of Excise in 1790.

Constructed mainly from steel, its crew were accommodated in large wingtip nacelles, giving it a triple-fuselage appearance. Its propeller drive system was also unusual, with the central fuselage containing twin engines coupled to a front-mounted contra-prop. Design The P 163 was one of several highly unusual bomber configurations studied by the Blohm & Voss aircraft division under Chief Designer Richard Vogt. It was developed in response to a 1942 Luftwaffe requirement for a Heinkel He 111 replacement.Cowin (1963) The primary structure was of welded sheet steel, in order to avoid using the strategically important light alloys which were in short supply.Sharp (2016) Its main fuselage was unmanned but otherwise conventional, having a tractor propeller and conventional tail, with the tailplane mounted part way up the fin. The tail section and control surfaces were to be made of fabric-covered wood. A shallow indent on the underside allowed for carriage of a semi-recessed bomb load. The lightly tapered, unswept wing was mounted low on the fuselage and its inner section housed the retractable main undercarriage. A large nacelle was mounted on each wing tip. also of armoured steel, and each housing two crew fore and aft, with additional gun positions. This unusual arrangement was designed to provide the pilot with maximum visibility and the gunners with maximum field of fire. Heavy defensive armament such as mixed 20 mm guns and 30 mm cannon was proposed. The distribution of weight outboard also improved the span loading of the wing, reducing the bending forces at the roots by an estimated 44% and allowing a lighter structure. To test the asymmetric pilot's position, one wing tip of a Blohm & Voss BV 141 was fitted with an experimental nacelle. Pilots found it sufficiently intuitive to use, although it was not fitted with flight controls. The propulsion system was also unconventional. The propeller was contra-rotating and driven by two coupled engines located in the fuselage immediately behind it. Two variants were studied in parallel, having different powerplants but being otherwise almost identical. The P 163.01 had a Daimler- Benz DB 613C based on two DB 603 series inline engines located side by side. The P 163.02 was given the more powerful BMW 803A based on two BMW 801 series radials placed back to back. Various offensive bomb loads were considered, between and . Large bombs would be recessed into the fuselage, while multiple smaller bombs would be carried under the wing, inboard of the undercarriage.

Career   Soviet Army service  He was born on 28 February 1952 in the city of Kyzyl-Kiya. He joined the Soviet Army in 1969 and studied at the Tashkent Higher All-Arms Command School before graduating in 1973. He was immediately sent to the Hungarian People's Republic where he commander a motorized rifle platoon in the Southern Group of Forces. He was recalled three years later to serve in the North Caucasus Military District in southern Russia as a regimental commander. He graduated from the Frunze Military Academy (now the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation) in 1985. From then on until the fall of the Soviet Union, he served in various units in eastern Russia including a rifle unit in Blagoveshchensk.  Studies and service in Russia  In the early and mid 1990s, he was an officer in the Russian Armed Forces during which he also continued his studies. From 1992-93, he was the Deputy Commander of the 8th Motor Rifle Division in the Far Eastern Military District. He graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia.  Return to Kyrgyzstan  He returned in 1995 and immediately became the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Kyrgyz Republic, a position he would stay in until 1999. The year he was dismissed was also the year in which he briefly served as the Head of the State Security Service and concurrently as the Secretary of the Security Council of Kyrgyzstan.

It assists in determining what to change, when to change it, and how to cause the change. The theory was established by Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt through his 1984 bestselling novel The Goal. Since this time, TOC has continued to develop and evolve and is a primary management tool in the engineering industry. When Applying TOC, powerful tools are used to determine the constraint and reduce its effect on the procedure, including: *The Five Focusing Steps *The Thinking Process *Throughput Accounting Although still limited by varying factors, time factors and human identification, TOC is the ideal engineering solution to increasing profit and reducing idle time in a production through its elimination of 'the weak link.'  History  Theory of Constraints is a method to determine a procedure in a sequence of procedures which has the greatest negative effect on the production line. The theory was first derived by Dr Eliyahu Goldratt through his 1984 bestselling novel, 'The Goal.' Dr Goldratt was a well-regarded educator in the construction industry, being sought-after by many large companies. In the mid 1990s, Goldratt in 2000, established Goldratt's Marketing Group to further enhance the TOC knowledge to those interested. Goldratt's Marketing Group was established to further enhance the knowledge of businesses in product production, suppliers and distributors, project managers and retail workers, further develop the quality of decision-making, improving communication and stimulating new solutions.Goldratt's Marketing Group, The theory operates with the assumption that every process has at least one influencing constraint, of which must be improved for the process to become more economic. Time spent trying to maximise processes which are not considered the bottleneck will not provide any benefits to the system. Attempting to reduce the influencing factor the bottleneck has on the entire system, will further the 'goal.' The procedure of reducing the influencing factor the bottleneck has on the system, continues as one bottleneck is minimised the attention turns to the new largest hindering procedure. Bottleneck In streamline manufacturing, the bottleneck is the station of a production line where greatest limiting factor lies. It is generally the station with the greatest amount of work in process at the work station. Bottlenecks often results in slow production times, surplus of raw material and low employee morale. Nearly every manufacturing system initially has a bottleneck. It is critical to be able to determine the procedure in the production line which is the limiting factor. Generally the station which has accumulated the largest amount of WIP can be considered the Bottleneck, however other engineering management techniques can be applied to determine the bottle neck.  Application  There are several practiced techniques applied to streamline manufacturing to reduce and or eliminate the constraining factor in the system. The methods applied to the systems all are designed to isolate the constraint, break it down into its components and find a suitable solution to reducing the negative impact the station has on the entire system. The thinking processes as well as the identification of the bottleneck is conducted in different manners. The four most common practiced techniques include; Five Focusing Steps, Thinking Process, Throughput Accounting and the Drum-Buffer-Effect.  Five Focusing Steps  The five focusing steps of TOC is an ideal approach to identifying the bottleneck and the correct procedure to reduce the impact keeping in mind the 'goal.' The five focusing steps are: #Identify the Constraint #Exploit the Constraint #Subordinate the Constraint #Elevate the Constraint #Repeat the Process =Identify the Constraint = The first step is to determine which process in the system is increasing the procedures overall throughput. Indicators of the bottleneck in the system will have accumulated a large amount of work in progress (WIP) and will have a higher average cycle time. = Exploit the Constraint = Exploiting the constraint is the procedure of quickly improving the current bottleneck with minimal disruption to the production line. Common rapid relief techniques include: *Inventory buffers *Quality check *Continuous operation *Schedule around bottleneck *Offload constraint work Improvements in these fields will have a quick solution to improvement of the constraint which will result in improved throughput = Subordinate to the Constraint = This step focuses on techniques to mitigate impact from upstream or downstream processes which may further delay the operations of the bottleneck. Techniques include: *Drum-Buffer-Rope *Subordinate maintenance *Added sprint capacity *Operations pace = Elevate the Constraint = In this step, actions are taken to break the constraints by the implementation of larger changes to improve the bottleneck. These changes usually include a large investment of time and or money. Techniques used include: *Use of performance data *Single-Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) program *Design improvements *Purchase additional equipment/staff = Repeat the Process = Once the initial steps of the Five Focusing Steps have been executed, the bottleneck of focus should no longer be the hindering process of the system. The implementation of the Five Focusing Steps is not used for one off improvement but for continuous improvements to the process. If the bottleneck has been broken, the next step is to repeat the focusing steps for the new bottleneck. If the bottleneck has not been broken, a new approach needs to be taken, including verifying that the investigated constraint has correctly been identified as the bottleneck.  Thinking Process  The thinking process in TOC, are tools used to determine, and fixing a problem in a system. In streamline processing it is a fundamental approach to always be striving to improve processes, eliminate bottlenecks and reduce manufacturing time. A common approach is to answer the following questions: A Guide to Implementing the Theory of Constraints], *What should I change? *What should It change to? *How to cause the change? Asking these questions when faced with a problem in a production line, will offer a range of solutions simultaneously to improve the current situation. The thinking process allows a smooth transition through the layers of the process to be able to adapt a more suitable method to improve the manufacturing system.  Throughput Accounting  Throughput accounting (TA) is a simple management accounting technique providing managers with information support to make profitable decisions for their system. It is an alternative method to traditional cost accounting, in which limiting factors in a system are identified and simple solutions are adapted to move towards reaching the businesses goal. The actions of throughput accounting maximize the net profit from a system in the shortest amount of time, with limited resources and limited expenditures. Throughput accounting uses through methods in dealing with income and expenses in a system Goldratt, Knowledge that Delivers], Throughput (T) is the rate at which a system can produce a unit. For profit orientated systems, throughput is considered net sales (S) minus totally variable cost (TVC). Investment (I) is the monetary value of the system. The value of inventory, buildings, machines and other assets are considered investments. Operating expenses (OE) is the cost of the supply chain operating to produce the unit. For a system manufacturing a physical item, the operating expense is the investment cost minus the cost of raw materials but including the cost of maintenance, rent and taxes. Drum- Buffer-Rope   Constraints and Limitations  A key process in TOC is the identification of the limiting factor in a production system to ultimately improve the production of units. A major limitation in the theory is that of identifying the station which is in fact the limiting procedure Limitations of the Theory of Constrains],.  Identification  It is not uncommon that when applying TOC the wrong work station is being examined as the limiting station when, however this station may only be the bottleneck due to another constraining factor not being focused on. This limitation theory, may encourage the waste of resources and times on a station which may in fact not require optimizing.  Variation  Another limitation of the theory is the lack of consideration towards varying factors. Factors such as demand for a product are not directly examined when TOC is applied. If the market demand for a product is varying, the use of resources to improve the situation may be better used expanding production capacity.  Time  Time is an influential constraint when applying TOC. The theory does not consider the current time frame for the production system and the duration of the demand for the product. The theory limits itself to short-term effects on the system rather than forecasting for the future. Overcoming this constraint means examining the long-term effects of work done to improve the constraint. If findings in a short-term analysis seem to repeat they can be considered as long-term effects, therefore implementing changes may be appropriate.

The theme of the work is a young man's soul and search for truth, faith and love, and his choice between love and faith. It is particularly noted as the seminal modernist novel in Icelandic.Halld√≥r Gu√∞mundsson, Loksins, loksins: Vefarinn mikli og upphaf √≠slenskra n√∫t√≠mab√≥kmennta (Reykjav√≠k: M√°l og menning, 1987). Style and synopsis The novel to a large extent is an epistolatory novel, comprising letters and sometimes literary works (both prose and verse) or monologues by its characters. It is littered with untranslated epigraphs and quotations by characters of material in other European languages. The modernist narrative mode was characterised by Peter Hallberg as 'very consistently' implying 'an abrupt break with the native Icelandic tradition of narrative art. The story is freely subjective; its rhythm varies like an unstable temperature curve. The principal character, the young Icelandic poet Steinn Elli√∞i, who shares many essential experiences with his author, engages the reader in a whirl of often paradoxical and conflicting ideas.'Peter Hallberg, 'Halld√≥r Laxness and the Icelandic Sagas', Leeds Studies in English, n. s. 13 (1982), 1-22 (p. 4). The novel is divided into eight books and one hundred chapters; the number of the chapters echoes the number of cantos in Dante's Divine Comedy, and it too 'records its young protagonist's own heaven, hell, and purgatory'.Hallberg Hallmundsson, 'Halld√≥r Laxness and the Sagas of Modern Iceland', The Georgia Review, 49.1 (Spring 1995), pp. 39-45 (p. 39). Book 1 introduces us to the family of Valger√∞ur Ylfingam√≥√∞ir and Elli√∞i: their sons √ñrn√≥lfur and Gr√≠m√∫lfur, Gr√≠m√∫lfur's wife J√≥fr√≠√∞ur, and their own son Steinn Elli√∞i. Book 2 is largely a series of epistolatory monologues by Steinn's childhood friend and sweetheart Dilj√° √ûorsteinsd√≥ttir, and his mother J√≥fr√≠√∞ur, exploring their dependence on Steinn and their frustrations with life. Book 3 follows Steinn's travels in Continental Europe and Britain in 1921‚Äì25, and his grappling with Christian theology. Book 4, which is mostly third-person narrative, explores Dilj√°'s ultimately unhappy marriage to √ñrn√≥lfur. Book 5 continues to follow Steinn's travels in Europe and Egypt, and his soul-searching. Book 6 sees Steinn desperately seeking spiritual meaning by entering a Benedictine monastery at Sept Fontaines in Frankophone Belgium. In the end, however, he decides not to take holy orders and to return to Iceland. Book 7 recounts Steinn's return to Iceland, where he discovers Dilj√°'s marriage to √ñrn√≥lfur and fails to find satisfaction among his family in Reykjav√≠k. It is again dominated by third-person narrative. Book 8 sees Steinn returning to a monastic life in Continental Europe. Dilj√°, who has parted from √ñrn√≥lfur, pursues him, and meets him in Rome. Steinn rejects her, and the novel closes with the image of Dilj√° abandoned in Rome. Reviews The Great Weaver from Kashmir had diverse effects on readers when it came out. Two critics are the most famous. Kristj√°n Albertsson wrote a review of ten pages that appeared in the magazine Vaka the same year as the book was published.

Shortly after its purchase of Pay 'n Save, after a magazine incorrectly ascribed the purchase to Donald Trump, the company was unsuccessfully sued by the Trump Organization over the use of the Trump name; however, The Trump Group's trademark was revoked in 1988.

She supported the Siege of Odessa and took part in the Action of 9 July 1941. Construction and specifications Viscolul was a Vospers-type motor torpedo boat, one of three purchased by Romania from the United Kingdom. The three boats were originally launched and completed in 1939 as MTB-20 (Viforul), MTB-21 (Vijelia) and MTB-23 (Viscolul). They were acquired by Romania in 1940. Along with her sister ships, Viscolul had a displacement of 32 tons, measuring 21.95 meters in length, with a beam of 5 meters and a draught of 1.1 meters. She was armed with two quadruple 7.7 mm machine guns, two torpedo tubes and could carry up to 8 depth charges or 4 mines. Power plant consisted of three Isotta Fraschini petrol engines powering 2 shafts, generating 3,450 hp which gave her a top speed of 40 knots.

Life  Shin Dong-ok was born in Goheung County, South Korea in 1977. He completed a PhD program in Korean literature at Hanyang University and is working as a lecturer. He made his literary debut in 2001 when he won a poetry contest run by the journal The Poetry and Anti-Poetry. His poetry collections include Akgong, Anakiseuteu gita (ÏïÖÍ≥µ, ÏïÑÎÇòÌÇ§Ïä§Ìä∏ Í∏∞ÌÉÄ Musician, Anarchist Guitar) (2008) and Utgo chumchugo yeoreumhara (ÏõÉÍ≥† Ï∂§Ï∂îÍ≥† Ïó¨Î¶ÑÌïòÎùº Laugh, Dance, and Summer Away) (2012). In 2010, he received the 5th Yun Dongju Literature Award for Young Writers.  Writing  Poet Kang Jeong has described Shin Dong-ok as a ‚Äúpoet who uses a strange new language yet makes it flow effortlessly.‚Äù Shin‚Äôs poetry is usually dark and somber in tone, exploring themes such as death, extinction, despair, and incest. It provides introspection on human lives through motifs like drawing, singing, dancing, and other sensory activities. Shin‚Äôs first poetry collection, in which he adopts the persona of a musician, has been described by critic Yoo Jun as ‚Äúhaving the echo of a string instrument. The echo represents solitude, pain, and the void.‚Äù His second poetry collection Utgo chumchugo yeoreumhara (ÏõÉÍ≥† Ï∂§Ï∂îÍ≥† Ïó¨Î¶ÑÌïòÎùº Laugh, Dance, and Summer Away) reveals the poet‚Äôs desire to dance through language. He deconstructs the meaning and function of everyday language and attempts to create new meaning and poetic diction, which he does to expand perceptual horizons. In a commentary explaining why Shin was selected for the Nojak Literature Prize, poet Shin Yong-mok writes: ‚ÄúAbove all, his pedantic and loquacious style has the power to make the reader glimpse a strange world hidden in between the lines. It is a curious phenomenon that occurs in the gap between matter and space, turmoil and silence.‚Äù  Works  Poetry Collections 1. „ÄéÏïÖÍ≥µ, ÏïÑÎÇòÌÇ§Ïä§Ìä∏ Í∏∞ÌÉÄ„Äè(ÎûúÎç§ÌïòÏö∞Ïä§ÏΩîÎ¶¨ÏïÑ, 2008) Musician, Anarchist Guitar.

For example, a fraction is put in lowest terms by cancelling out the common factors of the numerator and the denominator. As another example, if a√ób=a√óc, then the multiplicative term a can be canceled out if a‚â†0, resulting in the equivalent expression b=c; this is equivalent to dividing through by a.  Cancelling  If the subexpressions are not identical, then it may still be possible to cancel them out partly. For example, in the simple equation 3 + 2y = 8y, both sides actually contain 2y (because 8y is the same as 2y + 6y). Therefore, the 2y on both sides can be cancelled out, leaving 3 = 6y, or y = 0.5. This is equivalent to subtracting 2y from both sides. At times, cancelling out can introduce limited changes or extra solutions to an equation. For example, given the inequality ab ‚â• 3b, it looks like the b on both sides can be cancelled out to give a ‚â• 3 as the solution. But cancelling 'naively' like this, will mean we don't get all the solutions (sets of (a, b) satisfying the inequality). This is because if b were a negative number then dividing by a negative would change the ‚â• relationship into a ‚â§ relationship. For example, although 2 is more than 1, ‚Äì2 is less than ‚Äì1. Also if b were zero then zero times anything is zero and cancelling out would mean dividing by zero in that case which cannot be done. So in fact, while cancelling works, cancelling out correctly will lead us to three sets of solutions, not just one we thought we had. It will also tell us that our 'naive' solution is only a solution in some cases, not all cases: :* If b > 0: we can cancel out to get a ‚â• 3. :* If b < 0: then cancelling out gives a ‚â§ 3 instead, because we would have to reverse the relationship in this case. :* If b is exactly zero: then the equation is true for any value of a, because both sides would be zero, and 0 ‚â• 0. So some care may be needed to ensure that cancelling out is done correctly and no solutions are overlooked or incorrect. Our simple inequality has three sets of solutions, which are: :* b > 0 and a ‚â• 3. (For example b = 5 and a = 6 is a solution because 6 x 5 is 30 and 3 x 5 is 15, and 30 ‚â• 15) or :* b < 0 and a ‚â§ 3 (For example b = ‚Äì5 and a = 2 is a solution because 2 x (‚Äì5) is ‚Äì10 and 3 x (‚Äì5) is ‚Äì15, and ‚Äì10 ‚â• ‚Äì15) or :* b = 0 (and a can be any number) (because anything x zero ‚â• 3 x zero) Our 'na√Øve' solution (that a ‚â• 3) would also be wrong sometimes. For example, if b = ‚Äì5 then a = 4 is not a solution even though 4 ‚â• 3, because 4 √ó (‚Äì5) is ‚Äì20, and 3 x (‚Äì5) is ‚Äì15, and ‚Äì20 is not ‚â• ‚Äì15. In advanced and abstract algebra, and infinite series In more advanced mathematics, cancelling out can be used in the context of infinite series, whose terms can be cancelled out to get a finite sum or a convergent series. In this case, the term telescoping is often used. Considerable care and prevention of errors is often necessary to ensure the amended equation will be valid, or to establish the bounds within which it will be valid, because of the nature of such series. Related concepts and use in other fields In computational science, cancelling out is often used for improving the accuracy and the execution time of numerical algorithms.

Psychosensory therapy has its roots in traditional Chinese medicine in addition to energy psychology. Some important figures in psychosensory therapy include chiropractor George Goodheart, psychiatrist John Diamond, clinical psychologist Roger Callahan, and Ronald Ruden. Some of the common techniques used in psychosensory therapy include havening techniques, emotional freedom techniques, Callahan technique‚Äìthought field therapy (Callahan, 1985), and eye‚Äìmovement desensitization and reprocessing. These techniques in addition to others, according to both American Psychiatric Association (2016) and Stapleton and colleagues, are effective for treating Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Depression, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Background and Influences The origin of psychosensory therapy is rooted in applied kinesiology, traditional Chinese medicine, and the field of energy psychology.Diepold, J. H., & Goldstein, D. M. (2008). Thought Field Therapy and QEEG Changes in the Treatment of Trauma: A Case Study. Traumatology, 1-9 The term was first used by Ruden, which he described as altering feelings, thoughts, and behaviors through utilizing sensory input. Ruden argues that psychosensory therapy should be thought of as a third pillar to treatment, in addition to psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. Regarding traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture was used as a way to cure disease through different energy meridians in our body. According to Chang, the idea with TCM is that health is harmony, and disease is a lack of harmony, and one way of achieving harmony is through interaction of rhythms. Beginning in the field of Applied Kinesiology, where chiropractor George Goodheart (in the 1960s and 1970s) began exploring clinical observations through muscle testing (i.e., technique where tester monitors subtle changes in muscle tone as an indicator of sickness and health within the body). Goodheart also developed the technique ‚Äútapping‚Äù which he found helped his patients feel relief from trauma and stress, and is currently used today. According to Mollon, around the same time, John Diamond, a psychiatrist, joined Goodheart's team and began exploring the implications to psychological disorders and emotional conditions. What the team found was that when an individual thinks of something upsetting or lies, the muscle test will be slightly weaker. The team also found that by stimulating specific acupuncture meridians and asking the individual to say certain emotional affirmations, that would result in an ameliorated weakened muscle test and the individual would experience relief from the distress that just occurred. Therefore, Diamond found connections between acupuncture meridians, words, and emotions, and thus found a way of rapidly ameliorating the distress. Roger Callahan, a clinical psychologist, extended Diamond's work after a client he had been working with, was responding only marginally to cognitive and behavioral forms of treatment for a longstanding phobia of water. According to Mollon, one day in 1979, Callahan performed a muscle test (as Goodheart and Diamond did) and found his client to have a problem in her stomach meridian, so he asked her to tap on the other side of the meridian (her second toe or under the eye), and within a few seconds his client reported the anxiety in her stomach was gone and she ran to the swimming pool with her phobia never returning. Dr. Callahan went on to explore this event further, and with minimal success at the beginning, he eventually discovered that individuals require multiple points to be tapped in a specific sequence, and that varied between individuals. Callahan developed this procedure further and eventually, through trial and error, refined a muscle testing procedure that enabled the tapping sequence to be found, which worked rapidly at relieving distress for his clients. Callahan initially only applied this technique with phobias and anxieties, as his first book was titled ‚ÄúThe Five Minute Phobia Cure‚Äù but was later found to be helpful with other emotional problems and with PTSD. Callahan also discovered, through an individual's muscle response, an indication of individual's resistance to recovery. For example, a normal muscle response when an individual says, \\"I want to get over this issue\\" is strong, and when an individual says, \\"I don‚Äôt want to get over this issue\\" the normal muscle response is weak. However, some individual's muscles would respond to \\"I don‚Äôt want to get over this issue\\" as strong, and as Callahan suggests, these individuals would not benefit from the tapping method in addition to other treatments. According to Mollon, Callahan called this \\"a reversal\\" and claimed it would completely block treatment. Callahan speculated that these reversals would contain hidden motivations and conflicts that result from the body's energy system, and they can be rapidly reduced by Callahan's methods. Callahan called these methods thought field therapy (TFT) because an individual's thought does not only occur in the mind, but also in an energy field within the body that can be accessed through acupuncture and other similar methods. TFT was not based on a theory but more on observations based on the techniques he used. Callahan was mostly the only clinician during the 1980s to use these techniques, but in the 1990s others have started to promote these techniques. Energy psychology is a form of therapeutic techniques aimed at using our senses (e.g., touch) in combination with psychological exposure and cognitive techniques. The idea is thought to in part be sparked by quantum theory, in that, energy and matter are from the same reality, therefore, all psychological problems involve a dysregulated or imbalanced energy system. These techniques are derived from non-Western systems for spiritual development and healing.Feinstein, D. (2008). Energy Psychology: A Review of the Preliminary Evidence. Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training. 45(2), 199-213 Energy psychology is also thought of as \\"acupuncture without needles\\" for treating psychological disorders. Energy psychology has roots in applied kinesiology, traditional Chinese medicine, and clinical psychology. For example, TFT involves utilizing imagery and/or thoughts, feelings, and acupuncture as a way of improving symptoms. TFT involves techniques performed while the individual is thinking about his/her problem. These techniques involve activating specific acupuncture points, which then alleviate negative emotions that are associated with the psychological problems. Elements Psychosensory therapy can be defined as a form of therapeutic treatment that uses sensory input (i.e. touch, sight, sound, taste, smell) to alter our thoughts, mood, and behavior.Ruden, R. A. (2011). When the past is always present. New York, NY: Taylor and Francis Group The sensory input is often used therapeutically to evoke an extrasensory response‚Äîa response not bound to the limits of human senses (beyond the five senses). Sensory input can alter the brain. For instance, one may feel joy when listening to music, hunger when passing a restaurant, and comfort and warmth when massaged. Touch Touch therapy is older than recorded time, dating back to 1800 BC. The mechanism of touch is based on mechanoreceptors embedded in the skin. These mechanoreceptors monitor pressure, heat, perception of pain, and texture. Touch is a form of nonverbal communication that can have an extrasensory effect. The use of touch has been long associated with healing. For instance, acupuncture needling, an ancient practice in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and a touch therapeutic technique, deals with the insertion of needles into the skin in order to affect one's mood and perception of pain. Reiki, a Japanese touch technique, deals with movement of hands on the body and is often used for stress reduction. Massage therapy involves kneading different parts of the body with some pressure. This form of touch therapy breaks down tissue tensions, and restores normal lengths to the tendons, thus reducing stress. Massage has been shown to decrease cortisol levels, and cause a rise in dopamine and serotonin. Sight Symmetry and order may produce a calming effect to one's sight. The construction of symmetry can produce a sense of balance, harmony and perfect proportion. Symmetry is usually perceived to be more attractive than asymmetry. For instance, a beautiful symmetrical face can be comforting and pleasing to look toward. Lack of order can evoke confusion. Extensive research has demonstrated that the lack of sunlight can produce disorders such as depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and intent. Sound The Ancient Greeks considered music and sound to penetrate the depths of the soul. Various aspects of music can affect one's emotional state. For instance, the speed, rhythm, and melody are some aspects of music that can affect the human mind and emotions. Early forms of music such as communal chanting was often used in religious settings in order to evoke a feeling of safety and unity within the community. Some researchers consensually agree that music's soothing effect is due to inhibiting other sensory input (taste, sight, etc.), from affecting the senses. Different forms of music can affect one's mood. For instance, seasonal music may make one feel more cheerful, while martial music can make one feel more combative and quarrelsome. Taste Taste can have a sensory impact other than curbing hunger. Sugar is a mind-altering substance that can trigger a serotonin-release and produce a craving for sweet things such as comfort foods. Comfort foods typically have a high-carbohydrate and sugar content. The extrasensory effect of food can cause it to feel like a drug and comforting, which may lead to health concerns such as obesity. These comfort foods may be associated with positive, good feelings such as comfort, home, and safety. Smell Smell is a chemical sense that involves odoriferous molecules as the primary source of information. Smell is the fastest route to the brain's limbic system which governs emotion.Miller, R. A. (1983). The magical and ritual use of herbs. Rochester, VT: Destiny Books Smell impulses are faster than other sensory stimuli such as visual and auditory processing, and thus has a powerful effect on one's emotional state. Aromatherapy, is a smell technique that uses essential oils, extracted from plants for the treatment of physical and emotional health. The essential oils can be ingested or inhaled, or applied topically. Research has shown aromatherapy to produce modest to significant effects. In one study, researchers studied various scents (lavender, lemon, rose) for anti-stress. Results indicated that lemon scents were the best anti-stress aromas for stress situations. Interventions According to Ruden there are multiple psychosensory therapy techniques, including havening techniques, emotional freedom techniques (EFT), Callahan technique‚Äìthought field therapy (CT-TFT) and eye movement desensitizing and reprocessing (EMDR). Ruden claimed that some psychosensory therapy techniques need continuing maintenance, while others can facilitate permanent change. However, of these psychosensory therapy techniques, only EMDR for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is recognized as a psychological treatment for the Society of Clinical Psychology Division 12 of the American Psychological Association.Division 12 American Psychological Association. (2016). Posttraumatic stress disorder psychological treatments. Retrieved from https://www.div12.org/psychological- treatments/disorders/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/ Havening techniques Havening therapy refers to Ruden's approach to treating suffering related to trauma. This technique utilizes sensory inputs, including physical touching between the therapist and patient, to create a safe space for de-encoding traumatic memories. According to Ruden, touch facilitates an increase in calming chemicals like serotonin, which deactivates specific receptors in the memory bank. Consequently, successful havening can result in permeant change as amygdala-activated emotional responses to the traumatic memory are removed. However, havening has been criticized for a lacking empirical support, and that significantly more research on havening is needed before the practice can be considered evidence based. Emotional freedom techniques Emotional freedom techniques (EFT) utilizes various psychological treatments, like exposure techniques and cognitive techniques in tandem with stimulation of acupuncture points. In place of needles, EFT patients tap acupuncture points on the upper body and face. EFT has been found to be effective for a range of psychological disorders, including generalized anxiety, depression, and PTSD. In a study on food craving treatment, EFT was found to be comparably effective to cognitive behavioral therapy. However, reviews of EFT literature suggest that EFT only has moderate empirical support from primarily small or moderate randomized controlled trials. One report of two major reviews of the supportive evidence for EFT gathered over 30 years showed support for EFT to be methodologically weak. Callahan technique‚Äìthought field therapy Callahan technique‚ÄìThought field therapy (CT-TFT) was introduced by Roger Callahan in his book Five Minute Phobia Cure (Callahan, 1985). Like EFT, CT- TFT utilizes manual stimulation of acupuncture points, utilizing the stimulation while simultaneously focusing on the objects of fear or anxiety. As with havening techniques and EFT, the empirical basis for CT-TFT is a contested issue, as critics state CT-TFT support is methodically weak. Eye movement desensitizing and reprocessing Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) combines traumatic memory processing with eye movement. EMDR hypothesizes that bilateral eye movements information processing and integration, promoting fuller processing of traumatic memories. Unlike havening techniques, EFT, and CT-TFT, EMDR is recognized by the Society of Clinical Psychology Division 12 of the American Psychological Association as psychological treatment for PTSD with strong, albeit controversial research support. Some evidence shows that EMDR is comparably effective to exposure therapies for trauma, suggesting that exposure represents the critical element, and the eye movement component is superfluous.

It is grown primarily in the Alentejo region, with additional plantings around Lisbon and in the Pen√≠nsula de Set√∫bal. It is vigorous and productive, and requires a hot climate. The thick skins on these large loosely packed grapes enable them to withstand high heat and dehydration. It produces complex, light yellow wines with citrus and tropical aromas. Depending on the time of harvest, the wines can range from very acidic to ripe and alcoholic.

It was registered with the Flag Institute on 12 March 2019. __TOC__ Design The flag of Hampshire, conceived by Jason Saber and further refined by Brady Ells, retains the rose and crown pattern used in the county for several centuries in various guises. In 1992 the local county council received a formal grant of arms that included a gold royal crown on a red field, over a red rose on a gold field. Wishing to avoid using the restricted royal symbol of the crown on the council flag, Jason Saber replaced the \\"royal crown\\" with a specifically Saxon crown. This is also a reference to the county's association with the era of Alfred the Great and his capital of Winchester. Such a crown also appears in the full achievement of arms used by the council, symbolising exactly the same Alfredian legacy as intended in this flag. The red and white double Tudor rose is inspired by the double rose on the ‚ÄúArthurian‚Äù table in the Great Hall in Winchester. Notably, the bottom sepal of the rose on the Hampshire flag points down, the same way round as the Yorkshire Rose. This represents it being Southampton‚Äòs shire, in contrast to the rose on the flag of Northamptonshire which points up, the same way as the Lancashire Rose does. However, the Council flags' rose point upwards. The flag was officially added to the Flag Institute's registry of flags on 12 March 2019 after receiving support from Hampshire County Council, the Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire, and many local organisations. The county day is 15 July, which is St Swithin's Day. St Swithin was an Anglo-Saxon bishop of Winchester. Hampshire Hog The Hampshire Hog flag Another flag used in the county, created by Mike Jacobs, reflects Hampshire‚Äôs long held association with the ‚ÄúHampshire Hog‚Äù. The county was the natural habitat of wild boar and became closely associated with the creature, with some of their number being domesticated and contributing to the ‚ÄúHampshire Pig‚Äù and ‚ÄúWessex Saddleback‚Äù breeds. Hampshire people consequently received the soubriquet ‚ÄúHampshire Hogs‚Äù and it has become a popular county motif. The ‚ÄúHampshire Hog‚Äù flag maintains this tradition and is a graphic characterisation of the county, conveying a proud local character.

She was unbeaten in two races as a juvenile in 1984, including the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes. In 1985 she failed to win or place in four races but ran well in defeat in several top-class races including the 1000 Guineas and the July Cup. After retiring at the end of the season she became a very successful broodmare, and is the female-line ancestor of many good winners. Background Aviance was a small, \\"lightly-built\\" chestnut mare with a narrow white blaze bred in Ireland by the Ballydoyle Stud. She raced for most of her career in the colours of the British businessman Robert Sangster and was trained in Ireland by David O'Brien. She was sired by Northfields, an American horse whose biggest win came in the Louisiana Derby in 1971, before spending most of his stud career in Europe. His other winners included Northjet, Oats, North Stoke and Northern Treasure. Aviance's dam Minnie Hauk was a daughter of the influential broodmare Best In Show, whose other descendants included El Gran Senor, Try My Best, Xaar, Jazil, Rags to Riches and Redoute's Choice. Racing career 1984: two-year-old season Aviance began her racing career in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse in July. She started the odds-on favourite and won \\"impressively\\" by six lengths from twelve opponents. On her second, and only subsequent run as a two-year-old, the filly was stepped up to Group 1 class for the Phoenix Stakes over six furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse in August. Ridden by Declan Gillespie she started the 7/4 second favourite behind the Vincent O'Brien-trained colt Magic Mirror, who had won the Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. The best fancied of the other six runners were the unbeaten filly La Escala and the colt Beginners Luck. Aviance was among the leaders from the start, went clear of her rivals approaching the last quarter mile and won by three lengths from Well Related, with La Escala and Magic Mirror in third and fourth. Plans to bring the filly back for a run in the Cheveley Park Stakes were abandoned as she had \\"gone in her coat\\". In the official International Classification of two-year-olds for 1984 Aviance was given a rating of 75, seven pounds behind the top-rated filly Triptych. She was rated the third-best Irish filly behind Park Appeal and Alydar's Best. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 111 p (the \\"p\\" meaning that she was expected to make more than usual improvement) making her fourteen pounds inferior to Triptych. In their annual \\"Racehorses of 1984\\", Timeform described her as \\"a filly of considerable potential\\". 1985: three-year-old season Aviance began her second campaign in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 2 May. Ridden by Christy Roche she started at odds of 9/1 in a seventeen-runner field and finished well to take sixth place, three lengths behind the winner Oh So Sharp. In the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh three weeks later she failed to reproduce her best form and finished eleventh behind Al Bahathri. The filly was then dropped back to sprint distances and matched against older horses in the July Cup at Newmarket on 11 July. She ran well and disputed the lead for most of the way but faded in the final furlong and came home sixth of the nine runners behind Never So Bold. After the July Cup Aviance was formally transferred to the ownership of the Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos, whose colours she carried in the five furlong William Hill Sprint Championship at York Racecourse. Ridden by Roche and starting at odds of 10/1 she was in contention in the first half of the race but faded in the last quarter mile to finish seventh behin Never So Bold. Her performances in 1985 saw her awarded a 112 rating by Timeform, 19 pounds behind Oh So Sharp who was the top-rated three-year-old filly. Breeding record Aviance was retired to become a broodmare for her owner's stud. After the death of Niarchos in 1996 she passed into the ownership of Flaxman Holdings, the breeding company of the Niarchos family. She produced at least fourteen foals and nine winners between 1987 and 2006. *Chimes of Freedom, a chestnut filly, foaled in 1987, sired by Private Account.

Speaking with SOHH, M√Ωa explained how the song was created. In 2014, Harrison began working with several people from Los Angeles and was immediately introduced to New Jersey native production duo The HitList. Subsequently, the trio began working on music together and one of the first of many tracks Harrison recorded with them was \\"Welcome To My World\\". Harrison credits Fred as the person behind the idea of \\"Team You\\", clarifying, \\"it was The HitList's Fred who actually started that concept of \\"Team You\\" and when she heard it she \\"loved it\\". Commenting, \\"It‚Äôs so now, it‚Äôs very 90's with the music but it has very contemporary lines and has melodies.\\" Upon hearing the track, M√Ωa promptly added her writing to it and completed the song with him. Thus, that's how \\"Team You\\" was born. In retrospect, M√Ωa acknowledged, \\"We live in a world where everybody is hard, from girls to guys, and we keep poppin‚Äô that swag out of our mouths.\\" Reminiscing, \\"It‚Äôs very 90‚Äôs and you got that from the SWV's where it was OK to voice your affection and your love for somebody. So I wanted to take it back.\\" Critical reception In reviewing Smoove Jones, \\"Team You\\" received \\"mixed\\" to \\"favorable\\" reviews. Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim!, highlighted \\"Team You\\" as one of stand out tracks, opining the song \\"recall late-'90s/early '00s R&B;\\". While, United Kingdoms Gay Times, commented \\"Team You is well intentioned but has a mildly cheesy and repetitive chorus.\\" Personnel *M√Ωa ‚Äì vocals, songwriting *Fred Jenkins ‚Äì songwriting *Damar Beckett ‚Äì songwriting *Terence Odige ‚Äì composer Release history {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" !Region !Date !Format !Label ! - !scope=\\"row\\"Various December 8, 2015 Digital download   } References External links * 2015 singles 2015 songs M√Ωa songs Songs written by M√Ωa ","title":"Team You"},{"id":"55294303","text":"Elienor Werner (born 5 May 1998) is a Swedish female Pole vaulter, who won an individual gold medal at the Youth World Championships.

Byzantine city of Rometta in northeastern Sicily by the Kalbids, on behalf of the Fatimid Dynasty in order to complete the Muslim conquest of Sicily.  Siege  The siege was led by the two Kalbid cousins al-Hasan ibn Ammar and Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Kalbi. Following the fall of Taormina in 962, the Kalbids moved north to Rometta. The next year Ahmad began the siege. The city soon sent an envoy to the Byzantine emperor, Nikephoros II Phokas, requesting military aid and provisions. Nikephoros responded by equipping a fleet of around 40,000 men, many of whom were veterans from the Byzantine conquest of Crete, for battle in Sicily. The fleet was commanded by Niketas Abalantes, while the cavalry was commanded by Manuel Phokas. In October, 964, the siege was reinforced by Berber troops led by the governor of Sicily, al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi. On 25 October, the Byzantines and the Muslims engaged one another. The Byzantines were initially in control of the battle, however, the Muslims were soon able to rout them, supposedly killing more than a quarter of the force, including Manuel. The surviving Byzantines attempted to flee back to their fleet at Messina, but were ambushed upon departure in the Battle of the Straits and defeated. Without reinforcements, Rometta was unable to defend itself against the Kalbids and soon fell in May 965. The population of the city was massacred with the survivors being sold into slavery, and the city was colonized by Muslims.

History  The Euphrates Liberation Brigade was founded in Manbij as part of the MMC in October 2016. Originally 250 men strong, the militia expanded over time, mostly recruiting Arabs from Manbij city and its surroundings. Several of its fighters are former Free Syrian Army (FSA) members who abandoned the rebellion against Bashar al-Assad due to the increasing Islamist radicalism among anti- government forces. Regardless, the Begin‚ÄìSadat Center has considered the militia to be still part of the FSA. Soon after its formation, the Euphrates Liberation Brigade fought the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) west of Manbij during the Battle of al-Bab, in course of which it was allegedly bombed by the Turkish Air Force on 20 November. In April 2017, elements of the Euphrates Liberation Brigade were among a contingent of 200 MMC fighters that were sent to al-Thawrah in order to help the SDF to capture the city from ISIL. Under the command of Ibrahim Semho, the militia also took part in the following battle for ISIL's self-proclaimed capital Raqqa. Other parts of the unit remained at the frontlines west of Manbij, where at least one of their fighters was captured by Turkish-backed rebels in May 2017.  Ideology  The Euphrates Liberation Brigade has been set up from the outset as ethnically inclusivist and pro-democratic. Its stated aim is to help establish a federal, democratic Syria. The militia is also opposed to radical Islamism.

On the death of the emperor Jehangir, his son Shah Jahan ascended to the throne in 1627. His Gujarat viceroy Sher Kh√°n T√∫ar worked for relief in 1631-31 femine in the province. Shah Jahan sent his men to expand its territories further south. Between 1632 and 1635, four viceroys were appointed due to their precious gift to the emperor and they could not manage the province well. Kolis of Kankrej in north Gujarat committed excesses and the Jam of Nawanagar did not paid the tribute. Soon Azam Khan was appointed who put the province in order by subdueing Kolis in north and Kathis in Kathiawad. He also made the Jam of Nawanagar surrender. The next viceroy √çsa Tarkh√°n carried out financial reforms. In 1644, the Mughal prince Aurangzeb was appointed as the viceroy who was engaged in relious disputes for destroying a Jain temple in Ahmedabad. Due to his disputes, he was replaced by Sh√°istah Kh√°n who failed to subdue Kolis. So the prince Murad Bakhsh was appointed as the viceroy in 1654. He restored the disorder soon. In 1657, hearing news of Shah Jahan's severe illness, Murad Bakhsh declared himself the emperor and rebelled with his brother Aurangzeb. They defeated the Jaswant Singh and K√°sam Kh√°n, whom Sh√°h Jah√°n had appointed viceroys of M√°lwa and Gujar√°t respectively in the battle of Dharmatpur. They further went to the capital, Agra but were confronted by Dara Shikoh. They defeated him in the Battle of Samugarh (1658). Soon Aurangzed dumped and imprisoned Murad Bakhsh, confined his father and declared himself the emperor in 1658. Viceroys under Shah Jahan (1627‚Äì1658) Sher Kh√°n T√∫ar, Eighteenth Viceroy, 1627‚Äì1632 On the death of the emperor Jehangir, his son Shah Jahan ascended to the throne in 1627. Remembering the incumbent viceroy Saif Kh√°n's hostility to him during his rebellion against his father, he imprisoned him and appointed Sher Kh√°n T√∫ar eighteenth viceroy with Khw√°jah Hay√°t as his minister. When Shah Jahan was near Surat, he appointed M√≠r Shams- ud-d√≠n to be governor of Surat Castle. In 1627, Sh√°h Jah√°n on his way to Delji visited Ahmedabad and encamped outside of the city near the Kankaria Lake. Sher Kh√°n was advanced to the command of 5000 men, and received an increase of salary and other gifts. At the same time Kh√°n Jeh√°n was appointed his minister, and M√Ærza √çsa Tarkh√°n was made viceroy of Thatta in Sindh. In 1628, Khw√°jah Ab√∫l Hasan was sent to conquer the country of Nashik and Sangamner which he ravaged, and returned after taking the fort of Chandod and levying tribute from the chief of Baglan. In 1630, Jam√°l Kh√°n Kar√°wal came to the Gujar√°t-Kh√°ndesh frontier and captured 130 elephants in the Sult√°npur forests, seventy of which valued at a l√°kh of rupees were sent to Delhi. ;Famine, 1631‚Äì32 In 1631‚Äì32 Gujar√°t was wasted by the famine known as the Sati√°sio K√°l or ‚Äô87 famine. So severe was the scarcity that according to the B√°dsh√°h N√°ma, rank sold for a cake, life was offered for a loaf, the flesh of a son was preferred to his love. The emperor opened soup kitchens and alms-houses at Surat and √Åhmed√°b√°d and ordered Rupees 5000 to be distributed. Isl√°m Kh√°n, Nineteenth Viceroy, 1632 Sher Kh√°n was recalled in 1632, but died before he could be relieved by Isl√°m Kh√°n, the nineteenth viceroy of Gujar√°t, along with whom Khw√°jah Jeh√°n was chosen minister. Isl√°m Kh√°n's monthly salary was Rupees 4000, and his command was raised from 5000 to 6000. In 1632, Khw√°jah Jeh√°n went on pilgrimage to Mecca, and was succeeded as minister by √Ågha Afzal with the title of Afzal Kh√°n. Afzal Kh√°n was soon appointed commander of Baroda, and Ri√°yat Kh√°n succeeded him as minister. The post of viceroy of Gujar√°t appears to have been granted to whichever of the nobles of the court was in a position to make the most valuable presents to the emperor. ;Disorder, 1632. Government became lax, the Kolis of the K√°nkrej committed excesses, and the J√°m of Nawanagar withheld his tribute. B√°kar Kh√°n, Twentieth Viceroy, 1632 At this time of disorder, B√°kar Kh√°n presented the emperor with golden and jewelled ornaments to the value of Rupees 2,00,000 and was appointed viceroy, Ri√°yat Kh√°n being continued as minister. Sip√°hd√°r Kh√°n Twenty- first Viceroy, 1633 In 1633 Sip√°hd√°r Kh√°n was appointed viceroy, and presented the emperor with costly embroidered velvet tents with golden posts worthy to hold the famous Takhti-T√°√∫s or Peacock Throne which was just completed at a cost of one crore of rupees. Ri√°yat Kh√°n was continued as minister. Saif Kh√°n, Twenty-second Viceroy, 1633‚Äì1635 In 1635, Saif Kh√°n was appointed twenty-second viceroy, with Ri√°yat Kh√°n as minister. During Saif Kh√°n's tenure of power M√≠rza √çsa Tarkh√°n received a grant of the province of Sorath, which had fallen waste through the laxity of its governors. Before he had been in power for more than a year Saif Kh√°n was recalled. As he was preparing to start, he died at Ahmedabad and was buried in Sh√°h-i-√Ålam's shrine to which he had added the dome over the tomb and the mosque to the north of the enclosure. √Åzam Kh√°n, Twenty-third Viceroy, 1635‚Äì1642 Sarai (resthouse) built by Azam Khan in 1866, Bhadra Fort, Ahmedabad At the end of 1635, √Åzam Kh√°n was appointed twenty-third viceroy, with Ri√°yat Kh√°n in the first instance, and afterwards with M√≠r Muhammad S√°bir, as minister. The men who had recently been allowed to act as viceroys had shown themselves unfit to keep in order the rebellious chiefs and tribes of Gujar√°t. For this reason the emperor's choice fell upon √Åzam Kh√°n, a man of ability, who perceived the danger of the existing state of affairs, and saw that to restore the province to order, firm, even severe, measures were required. ;Engaged with the Kolis and Kathis When √Åzam Kh√°n reached Sidhpur, the merchants complained bitterly of the outrages of one K√°nji,a Chunvalia Koli, who had been especially daring in plundering merchandise and committing highway robberies. √Åzam Kh√°n, anxious to start with a show of vigour, before proceeding to √Åhmed√°b√°d, marched against K√°nji, who fled to the village of Bh√°dar near Kheralu, sixty miles north-east of √Åhmed√°b√°d. √Åzam Kh√°n pursued him so hotly that K√°nji surrendered, handed over his plunder, and gave security not only that he would not again commit robberies, but that he would pay an annual tribute of Rupees 10,000. √Åzam Kh√°n then built two fortified posts in the Koli country, naming one √Åzam√°b√°d after himself, and the other Khal√≠l√°b√°d after his son. He next marched to Kathiawad and subdued the Kathis, who were continually ravaging the country near Dhandhuka, and to check them erected a fortified post called Sh√°hp√∫r, on the opposite side of the river to Chuda-R√°npur. √Ågha F√°zil known as F√°zil Kh√°n, who had at one time held the post of minister, and had, in 1636, been appointed governor of Baroda, was now selected to command the special cavalry composing the bodyguard of prince Muhammad Aurangzeb. At the same time, Sayad Ilahd√°d was appointed governor of Surat fort, √çsa Tarkh√°n remaining at Junagadh. In 1637, M√≠r Muhammad S√°bir was chosen minister in place of Ri√°yat Kh√°n, and in 1638 Mu√Æz-zul-Mulk was re-appointed to the command of Surat fort. Shortly after √Åzam Kh√°n's daughter was sent to Delhi, and espoused to the emperor's son Muhammad Shuj√° Bah√°dur. In 1639, √Åzam Kh√°n, who for his love of building was known as Udhai or the White Ant, devoted his attention to establishing fortified posts to check rebellion and robbery in the country of the Kolis and the K√°this. So complete were his arrangements that people could travel safely all over Jhalawad, Kathiawad, Nawanagar, and Kutch. ;Revolt of the J√°m of Nawanagar, 1640. In 1640, The J√°m of Nawanagar withheld his tribute, and set up a mint to coin koris. When √Åzam Kh√°n heard of this, he marched with an army against Naw√°nagar, and, on arriving about three miles from the city, he sent the J√°m a peremptory order to pay the arrears of tribute and to close his mint, ordering him, if any disturbance occurred in that part of the country, at once to send his son to the viceroy to learn his will. He further ordered the J√°m to dismiss to their own countries all refugees from other parts of Gujar√°t. The J√°m being unable to cope with √Åzam Kh√°n, acceded to these terms; and √Åzam Kh√°n, receiving the arrears of tribute, returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. As √Åzam Kh√°n's stern and somewhat rough rule made him unpopular, Sayad J√°l√°l Bukh√°ri whose estates were being deserted from fear of him brought the matter to the emperor's notice. √çsa Tarkh√°n, Twenty-fourth Viceroy, 1642‚Äì1644 In consequence, in 1642, the emperor Shah Jahan recalled √Åzam Kh√°n and appointed in his place M√≠rza √çsa Tarkh√°n, then governor of Sorath, twenty-fourth viceroy of Gujar√°t. And as it was feared that in anger at being re-called, √Åzam Kh√°n might oppress some of those who had complained against him, this order was written by the emperor with his own hand. Thanks to √Åzam Kh√°n's firm rule, the new viceroy found the province in good order, and was able to devote his attention to financial reforms, among them the introduction of the share, bh√°gvat√°i, system of levying land revenue in kind. When M√≠rza √çsa Tarkh√°n was raised to be viceroy of Gujar√°t, he appointed his son In√°yatull√°h to be governor of Junagadh, and Muiz-zul-Mulk to fill the post of minister. During the viceroyalty of M√≠rza √çsa, Sayad Jal√°l Bukh√°ri a descendant of Saint Sh√°h-i-√Ålam was appointed to the high post of Sadr-us- Sud√∫r or chief law officer for the whole of India. This was a time of prosperity especially in Surat, whose port dues which were settled on the P√°dsh√°h Begam had risen from two and a half to five l√°khs. M√≠rza √çsa Tarkh√°n's term of power was brief. Prince Muhammad Aurangzeb, Twenty-fifth Viceroy, 1644‚Äì1646 In 1644, the emperor appointed prince Muhammad Aurangzeb to the charge of Gujar√°t, Muiz-zul-Mulk being ordered by the emperor to continue to act as his minister. In 1645, seventy-three elephants were captured in the forests of Dahod and Champaner. Prince Aurangzeb's rule in Gujar√°t was marked by religious disputes. In 1645, the Mughal prince Aurangzeb desecrated the Chintamani Parshvanath temple constructed (1638) by the influential Jain merchant Shantidas Jhaveri near Saraspur, a suburb of √Åhmed√°b√°d, above a mile and a half east of the city. According to the French traveller Jean de Th√©venot (1666), Aurangzeb caused a cow to be killed in the temple premises, destroyed the noses of all idols in the temple, and then converted the place into a mosque called Quvval-ul-Islam (\\"the Might of Islam\\"). Shantidas complained to Aurangzeb's father Emperor Shah Jahan. In 1648, the Emperor issued a firman (order) declaring that the building should be handed over to Shantidas, and a wall should be raised between the mihrabs (niches in the mosque walls) and the rest of the original temple building. It also declared that the Muslim fakirs housed in the mosque premises should be removed, and the materials carried away from the temple should be restored. In another case, both of the contending parties were Muslims, the orthodox believers, aided by the military under the prince's orders, who was enraged at Sayad R√°ju one of his followers joining the heretics, attacking and slaughtering the representatives of the Mahdavia sect in √Åhmed√°b√°d. Sayad R√°ju's spirit, under the name of R√°j√∫ Shah√≠d or R√°j√∫ the martyr, is still worshipped as a disease- scaring guardian by the Pinjaras and Mansuris and D√∫dhw√°las of √Åhmed√°b√°d. Sh√°istah Kh√°n, Twenty-sixth Viceroy, 1646‚Äì1648 In consequence of the part he had taken in promoting these disturbances, prince Aurangzeb was relieved and Sh√°istah Kh√°n appointed twenty-sixth viceroy of Gujar√°t. In the following year, Muiz-zul-Mulk, who had till then acted as minister, was recalled, and his place supplied by H√°fiz Muhammad N√°sir. At the same time the governorship of Surat and Cambay was given to √Åli Akbar of Ispah√°n. This √Åli Akbar was a Persian horse merchant who brought to Agra seven horses of pure Arabian breed. For six of these, Sh√°h Jah√°n paid Rs. 25,000. The seventh a bay so pleased the emperor that he paid Rs. 15,000 for it, named it the Priceless Ruby, and considered it the gem of the imperial stud. In 1646, √Åli Akbar was assassinated by a Hindu and Muiz-zul-Mulk succeeded him as governor of Surat and Cambay. Prince Muhammad D√°r√° Shikoh, Twenty-seventh Viceroy, 1648‚Äì1652 As Sh√°istah Kh√°n failed to control the Gujar√°t Kolis, in 1648, prince Muhammad D√°r√° Shikoh was chosen viceroy, with Ghairat Kh√°n as his deputy and H√°fiz Muhammad N√°sir as minister, while Sh√°istah Kh√°n was sent to Malwa to relieve Sh√°h Naw√°z Kh√°n. While D√°r√° Shikoh was viceroy, an ambassador landed at Surat from the court of the Turkish Sult√°n Mehmed IV. (). In 1651, M√≠r Yahy√° was appointed minister in place of H√°fiz Muhammad N√°sir, and in 1652 prince D√°r√° was sent to Kandahar due to their war with Safavids. Sh√°istah Kh√°n, Twenty-eighth Viceroy, 1652‚Äì1654 On the transfer of the prince, Sh√°istah Kh√°n became viceroy for the second time, with M√≠r Yahy√° as minister and Sult√°n Y√°r governor of Baroda with the title of Himmat Kh√°n. M√≠rza √çsa Tarkh√°n was summoned to court from his charge of Sorath and his son Muhammad S√°lih was appointed his successor. In a.d. 1653 an ill-advised imperial order reducing the pay of the troopers, as well as of the better class of horsemen who brought with them a certain number of followers, created much discontent. During this year several changes of governors were made. Muhammad N√°sir was sent to Surat, Himmat Kh√°n to Dholka, the governor of Dholka to Baroda, Kutb- ud-d√≠n to Junagadh, Sayad Sheikhan son-in-law of Sayad Diler Kh√°n to Tharad under P√°tan, and Jagm√°l, the holder of Sanand, to Dholka. In the same year Sh√°istah Kh√°n made an expedition against the Chunv√°lia Kolis, who, since √Åzam Kh√°n's time (1642), had been ravaging Viramgam, Dholka, and Kadi, and raiding even as far as the villages round √Åhmed√°b√°d. Prince Mur√°d Bakhsh, Twenty- ninth Viceroy, 1654‚Äì1657 In spite of Sh√°istah Kh√°n's success in restoring order, the emperor in 1654 appointed in his place prince Muhammad Murad Bakhsh twenty-ninth viceroy of Gujar√°t. Di√°nat Kh√°n, and immediately after him Rehmat Kh√°n, was appointed minister in place of M√≠r Yahy√°. Muj√°hid Kh√°n Jh√°lori relieved M√≠r Shams-ud-d√≠n as governor of Patan and Godhra was entrusted to Sayad Hasan, son of Sayad Diler Kh√°n, and its revenues assigned to him. When prince Mur√°d Bakhsh reached Jhabua (near Bhopal) on his way to √Åhmed√°b√°d, the chief presented him with Rupees 15,000 as tribute; and when he reached √Åhmed√°b√°d, K√°nji, the notorious leader of the Chunv√°lia Kolis; surrendered through Sayad Sheikhan, and promised to remain quiet and pay a yearly tribute Rupees 10,000. Dildost, son of Sarfar√°z Kh√°n, was appointed to the charge of the post of Bijapur under P√°tan; while Sayad Sheikhan was made governor of Sadra and Piplod, and Sayad √Åli paymaster, with the title of Radawi Kh√°n. Many other changes were made at the same time, the prince receiving a grant of the district of Jun√°ga·∏çh. A merchant Virji Vora said to have been one of the richest merchants of Surat, is noted as sending the emperor four Arab horses and prince Mur√°d as presenting the emperor with eighteen of the famous Gujar√°t bullocks. During the viceroyalty of D√°r√° Shikoh, sums of Rs. 1,00,000 to Rs. 2,00,000 used to be spent on articles in demand in Arabia. The articles were sent under some trustworthy officer and the proceeds applied to charitable purposes in the sacred cities. K√°sam Kh√°n, Thirtieth Viceroy, 1657‚Äì1659 ;Murad Bakhsh and Aurangzeb rebels and wins At the end of 1657, on the receipt of news that Sh√°h Jah√°n was dangerously ill, prince Mur√°d Bakhsh proclaimed himself emperor by the title of Murawwaj-ud-d√≠n and ordered the reading of the Friday sermon and the striking of coin in his own name. His next step was to put to death the minister √Åli Naki, and direct his men to seize the fort of Surat then held by his sister the Begam S√°hibah and to take possession of the property of the Begam. He imprisoned Abdul-Lat√≠f, son of Isl√°m Kh√°n, an old servant of the empire. D√°r√° Shikoh representing Mur√°d's conduct to the emperor obtained an order to transfer him to the governorship of the Ber√°rs. Mur√°d Bakhsh borrowing Rupees 550000 from the sons of Shantidas Zaveri, Rupees 40000 from Rav√≠d√°s partner of Shantidas, and Rupees 88000 from S√°nmal and others, raised an army and arranged to meet his brother prince Aurangzeb, and with him march against the Mah√°r√°ja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur and K√°sam Kh√°n, whom Sh√°h Jah√°n had appointed viceroys of M√°lwa and Gujar√°t, and had ordered to meet at Ujjain and march against the princes. Mur√°d Bakhsh and Aurangzeb, uniting their forces early in 1658, fought an obstinate battle with Jaswant Singh, in which they were victorious, and entered Ujjain in triumph. From Ujjain, prince Mur√°d Bakhsh wrote Mu√¢tamid Kh√°n his eunuch an order allotting to M√°nikchand Rupees 150000 from the revenues of Surat, Rupees 100000 from Cambay, Rupees 10000 from Petlad, Rupees 75000 from Dholka, Rupees 50000 from Bharuch, Rupees 45000 from Viramgam, and Rupees 30000 from the salt works, in all Rupees 550000. Further sums of Rupees 40000 are mentioned as due to Ravid√°s partner of Shantidas, and Rupees 88000 to S√°nmal and others. From Ujjain, the princes advanced on Agra. At Dholp√∫r known as the Battle of Samugarh, they fought a still more obstinate battle with the imperial forces commanded by prince D√°r√° Shikoh and after a long and doubtful contest were victorious. Prince Dara Shikoh fled to Delhi, and the princes advanced and took possession of Agra. After confining his father, Aurangzeb marched for Mathura, and having no further use of Mur√°d, he there seized and imprisoned him in 1658. From Mathura, Aurangzeb went to Delhi from which Dar√° Shikoh had meanwhile retired to Lahore. In 1658, while his father Shah Jahan was still alive, Aurangzeb assumed the imperial titles and ascended the Mughal throne.

P.

The Sanyo Micro Pack 35 case and controls were designed to resemble a film camera. The unit was marketed for \\"capturing the first words of the child, terrorizing party guests and sending voice letters\\". The compact styled device used a simplified drive mechanism for tape transport. There was no capstan. Instead, the motor driveshaft protruded into the cartridge between the tape reels pressing against a rubber coating. The whole motor tilted back and forth to press on one reel or the other which determined the tape direction. The changing amount of tape on the engaged reel caused a changing speed of tape transport and up to 1% wow and flutter. A control on top of the unit allowed the tape speed to be varied between Slow (low quality/long recording time) and Fast (better quality/short recording time). The unit featured an input jack for a microphone, an output jack for an earphone and an internal speaker. The VU meter for monitoring the audio level on recording was used as also used in playback mode as a charge level indicator of the four AA batteries.

The ¬º inch wide magnetic tape was guided in a diagonal at the open upper side of the cartridge on tilted rollers in the upper corners in the cartridge. Inside the machine the drive tape head and erase head were installed in an equivalent tilted angle. The analog mono sound recording was a single track per side of the cartridge. Each end of the tape got a conductive mark to stop tape transport. A push button on top of the player was in installed to override the conductive stripe and allow the cartridge to be played in the opposite direction. In all operating modes the cartridge was held in place by another pin which also disengaged the reel brake.  Market  The high level of wow and flutter in the tape transport and the low frequency response made the device less useful for music. The format, which appeared a year after Compact Cassette soon lost market share.

It is intended to prevent various economic and public accommodation-related acts of discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. The current version of the bill is sponsored by Kaka Bag-ao, Geraldine Roman, Tom Villarin in the House of Representatives, and Risa Hontiveros in the Senate. The version in the House of Representatives passed its third reading most recently on September 20, 2017, but died in the Senate. It has been refiled for the 18th Congress. Legislative history The bill was first filed in congress in 2000 by former Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago and former Akbayan party-list Representative Etta Rosales. The bill passed a third reading in the House but stalled in the Senate. Similar measures were filed by other senators in the 15th and 16th congresses without success. The bill was refiled by Defensor- Santiago in every congressional period in the Senate until her last term in 2016. The counterpart bill in the House was also filed continuously by the representatives of Akbayan. 17th Congress In 2017, House Bill No. 4982 (sponsored by Dinagat Islands Representative Kaka Bag-ao (the principal author of the measure since her first term), Bataan Representative Geraldine Roman, Akbayan Representative Tomas Villarin, and several others) was not approved for a third and final reading for the first time since 2001 with 198 members of the House of Representatives voting for the bill and none opposing it, a historic pro-LGBT move from the House of Representatives. The counterpart bill in the Senate, filed by Senator Risa Hontiveros (the first Akbayan senator), was in the period of interpolations by May 2018. It was backed by Senators Loren Legarda, Grace Poe, Nancy Binay, Franklin Drilon, Bam Aquino, Chiz Escudero, Ralph Recto, Sonny Angara, JV Ejercito, Francis Pangilinan, Juan Miguel Zubiri, and Leila de Lima, although de Lima is barred from voting on the bill as she is currently in police custody. It was opposed by Senators Tito Sotto, Manny Pacquiao, Cynthia Villar, and Joel Villanueva (who signed up as a co-author of the bill). Other senators such as Win Gatchalian, Koko Pimentel, Antonio Trillanes, Panfilo Lacson, and Richard J. Gordon did not express their support or rejection of the bill. Senator Trillanes is currently facing cases that may put him in jail, which may make him ineligible to vote for the bill like senator de Lima if he is arrested. Additionally, Alan Peter Cayetano and Gregorio Honasan lost their voting rights on Senate measures as they declined to be part of the presidential cabinet. Out of the existing 24 Senate seats: 12 seats can vote and are in support of the bill, 1 seat is in support but cannot vote on the bill, 4 seats can vote and are in opposition to the bill, 5 seats can vote on the bill but have not yet given their positions on it (although the number may be reduced to 5), and 2 seats are de facto vacated. For a bill to pass the Senate, it needs more than half the votes in favor of it from all 24 Senate seats. The SOGIE Equality Bill currently is supported by 12 seats that are allowed to vote on the measure. The bill is also supported by the Catholic student governments of University of the Philippines-Diliman (UPD), Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU), De La Salle University (DLSU)-Manila, De La Salle - College of St. Benilde (CSB), Far Eastern University (FEU), Miriam College (MC), St. Scholastica's College (SSC)-Manila and San Beda University (SBU). The longest running LGBT student organization, UP Babaylan, has also been supporting the bill ever since it was first filed, as well as known celebrities and icons such as Heart Evangelista, Nadine Lustre, Bianca Gonzalez, Iza Calzado, Charo Santos-Concio, Dingdong Dantes, Joey Mead King, Divine Lee, Karen Davila, Chot Reyes, Tootsy Angara, BJ Pascual, Samantha Lee, Christine Bersola-Babao, Rajo Laurel, Tim Yap, Anne Curtis, Mari Jasmine, Laureen Uy, Pia Wurtzbach, Lorenzo Ta√±ada III, Vice Ganda, Arnold Van Opstal, and Chel Diokno. In March 2018, a small group of Christians protested at the Senate against the SOGIE bill by calling the proposed legislation an \\"abomination\\", adding that homosexuality is a \\"sin\\" citing that their hate is justified because it is written in the Bible and that identifying as part of the LGBT community is a lifestyle. The group also claimed that the bill relates to same-sex marriage, which is not found anywhere within the bill. Senators Villanueva, Gatchalian, and Villar spoke against same-sex marriage after the protest. In May 2018, senator Tito Sotto, who opposes the SOGIE bill, became the new Senate President. In an interview, Sotto was asked on the bill's passage, to which he responded, \\"Not in this congress.\\" In July 2018, various high-profile celebrities rallied for the passage of the SOGIE bill. They also called out senators Sotto, Pacquiao, and Villanueva to end the debates and pass the proposed legislation. In August 2018, at the height of the bill's postponed debates, various discrimination incidents against the Filipino LGBT community surfaced, causing public calling for the passage of the SOGIE Equality Bill in the Senate. Numerous influential personalities, including political allies of the three senators who oppose the bill, sided with the calls to pass the landmark proposal. In January 2019, fake news and chain mail claiming that there are \\"Satanic\\" and \\"same-sex marriage\\" provisions in the SOGIE bill began circulating as a move to impede the bill's progress. The actual bill does not have any Satanic or same-sex marriage provisions. In May 2019, the SOGIE Equality Bill officially became the longest-running bill under the Senate interpellation period in Philippine history. Supporters of the bill have remarked that the prolonged interpellation was intended by the dissenters to block the passage of the historic anti-discrimination bill. The bill's principal author and sponsor in the Senate, senator Risa Hontiveros, called on her Senate colleagues to formally close the question period so that the bill can be open for amendments and voting. In June 2019, with the end of the session of the 17th Congress, the SOGIE Equality Bill prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression‚Äîafter the lawmakers failed to tackle the bill in this session of the Senate of the Philippines. The Senate version of the bill was first filed in August 11, 2016. It was sponsored by Risa Hontiveros in December 14 of the same year. The bill has become one of the slowest-moving bills in the country's history. The passed House version of the bill would have penalised discrimination with a fine of not less than ‚Ç±100,000 but not more than ‚Ç±500,000, or imprisonment of not less than one year but not more than six years or both, depending on the court's decision. However, she said the bill had gained new allies and wider acceptance among policy makers and the public and that she is confident the bill will pass in the next Congress. The bill was archived, and the bill must be refiled in the 18th Congress, restarting the one to three-year process of enactment. 18th Congress Versions of the SOGIE Equality Bill were refiled in the 18th Congress by Senator Risa Hontiveros, Senator Imee Marcos, Senator Leila de Lima, and Senator Kiko Pangilinan, while another similar bill was filed by Senator Sonny Angara. Senators Bong Go, Juan Miguel Zubiri, Ralph Recto, and Franklin Drilon announced their support for the SOGIE Bill. In the House of Representatives, various representatives also filed their versions of the bill, notably, Sol Aragones of Laguna Geraldine Roman of Bataan, Loren Legarda of Antique, Maria Lourdes Alba of Bukidnon, Jose Belmonte of Quezon city, Bayan Muna representatives Eufemia Cullamat, Carlos Zarate, and Ferdinand Gaite, Kristine Singson of Ilocos Sur, Bagong Henerasyon representative Bernadette Dy, Eric Olivarez of Para√±aque city, and Francis Abaya of Cavite. Representatives Sy-Alvarado, De Venecia, Reyes, Taduran, Bordado, Olivarez, and Violago have also signed as co-author of the bill filed by representative Roman, while Gabriela Women's Party representative Brosas has signed as co- author of the bill filed by Bayan Muna. Religious leaders also gave their support for the SOGIE Bill, such as Koko Alviar of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (Aglipayan Church) Sister Mary John Mananzan, OSB, executive director of the Institute of Women's Studies of the Catholic St. Scholastica's College,https://outragemag.com/give-attention-to-people-who-actually-suffer- discrimination-and-violence-sister-mary-john-mananzan/ Bishop Solito Toquiero of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines, and Pastor Kakay Pamaran of the Union Theological Seminary. In contrast, representative Eddie Villanueva claimed that the SOGIE Bill is 'imported' and not part of Filipino culture. Senate president Tito Sotto expressed dissent against the bill again, adding that the bill \\"will not pass\\" in the Senate as long as he is the Senate president. Senator Joel Villanueva also expressed dissent. Various personalities announced their support for the SOGIE Bill, namely: Anne Curtis, Heart Evangelista, Catriona Gray, Pia Wurtzbach, Judy Taguiwalo, Iza Calzado, Nadine Lustre, Janine Gutierrez, BJ Pascual, Mari Jasmine, and Samantha Lee.

He was a longtime colonial civil servant and chief architect of the Public Works Department. He was also an official member of the Legislative Council and Urban Council. He was responsible for many infrastructure and housing projects and advocated for private bathroom and kitchen in every unit of the housing estate which is known as the \\"Wright Principle\\". He was the founding member and president of the Hong Kong Institute of Architects. Biography Wright was born in Hong Kong on 19 September 1912 into a civil servant family. He was educated at the Brentwood School in the United Kingdom and became an architect. He joined the Hong Kong government in 1938 and began to work at the former Public Works Department. He was interned during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. After the war, Wright became the chief architect of the Public Works Department and played an instrumental role in the massive effort to house the millions of refugees fleeing to Hong Kong from China. The first generation of public housing estates, built in haste, resembled army barracks, and had shared bathrooms. In 1952 he designed the first public rental housing estate with private bathrooms and kitchens, at Sheung Li Uk, for the Hong Kong Housing Society, in which his design became known as the \\"Wright Principle\\". He was also founding member and president of the Hong Kong Institute of Architects in 1958. In 1963, he became Director of Public Works in which he served until 1969. In this capacity, Wright was also an official member of the Legislative Council and Urban Council. In 1969, he was appointed Hong Kong Commissioner in London. He retired from the civil service in 1973. Hong Kong Housing Society's Lai Tak Tsuen in Tai Hang, built in 1975 and 1976, was named after Wright's Chinese name. He resided in Knightsbridge, London after his retirement. He commented on Hong Kong affairs occasionally, including the proposed demolition of the Government Hill in 2012.

Construction Made from Wisconsin Lannon stone, construction of the building took place between March, 1930 and January, 1931 on land owned by the university. The cost of construction was approximately $470,000. The Field House was the second building constructed on the present UT campus. The facility covered more than an acre of ground, utilized a dirt floor and seated only 2,000 spectators around an elevated wooden basketball court. The building also contained two gymnasiums devoted to men's and women's physical education classes. Usage The primary use for the gymnasium was a location that could be utilized for men's and women's physical education courses as well as being the facility for the Toledo Rockets men's basketball team to compete. Additionally, the venue was utilized for social and academic functions including commencement ceremonies. The Field House provided a great venue and gathering place for all to come and enjoy the speeches or performances being held. Although its main use was a gymnasium for basketball it held some very iconic speakers and bands. Some famous people that spoke in the Field House included politicians Barry M. Goldwater as well as President Richard Nixon. Additionally, some famous bands and singers performed in the Field House including Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Kenny Rogers, The J. Geils Band, The Kingston Trio, Hall and Oates, The Beach Boys, Simon and Garfunkel and also The Byrds. Remodel Upon completion of Centennial Hall in 1976, The Field House became obsolete and became underutilized becoming a storage facility for the campus for nearly 20 years. In 2006, however, facing a burst in student enrollment, an expansion of program offerings, and concern about future space needs, the university commissioned a major overhaul that, three years later, recast the 134,200 square foot gymnasium into a learning environment housing classrooms, teaching labs, faculty offices, and space for future growth. Construction began in July, 2007, with the demolition of the old interior and extensive cleanup effort on the exterior brickwork commencing in December.

The library is located in Gainesville, Texas.  Founding (1903)  Pictured above is _Lillian Gunter_ , the first Librarian of the Gainesville Carnegie Public Library and Cooke County Free Library. The first city library in Gainesville, Texas was located in a building known as the Joe Townsley building on North Dixon Street in 1903. The XLI Club added the first collection of 400 books and it was ran by Sue McKemie, she was a volunteer that offered to keep the library open one day a week. The library's popularity grew and its hours were extended to each afternoon with a growing list of volunteers. This early library was known as the XLI Club Subscription Library. In 1907 the Gainesville city council allowed two rooms on the second floor to be used inside city hall as the library. Once established on the second floor the first paid librarian was Gertha Lockard. Pioneer county librarian Lillian Gunter raised funds alongside the XLI Club for a Carnegie Foundation library between the years 1908‚Äì1910. City council agreed to financially support the library in 1912 on an annual basis and to help maintain a Carnegie Library once built. By 1913 the $1,500 needed to secure and purchase a lot for the future library had been raised. The council would continue to provide $1,500 for maintenance purposes after its completion. The XLI Club was presented with a deed by Judge C.C. Potter for a 60 foot by 100 foot plot on the southwest corner of Denton and Main Streets. An architect from Sherman, Texas named William A. Tackett drew up plans and specifics for the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which was approved, and adopted by the city council of Gainesville. E.M. Wilkens of Fort Worth, Texas, was paid $10,998.00 as the general contractor and building was commenced on December 27, 1913 as noted by Ann Woods in her recounting. The cost of the complete project was $15,000 in 1914. 240x240px  Lillian Gunter  Lillian Gunter (1870‚Äì1926) hailed from Sivells Bend, Texas. After receiving an education in St. Louis, Missouri, Gunter moved to Gainesville where her father had his plantation and, whereon his death she assumed possession of the establishment from 1892 to 1902. She would go on to join the XLI Club and started the XLI Club Subscription Library which Gunter managed for 10 years. Once Andrew Carnegie gave his grant to the city, Gunter and her fellow club members raised the funds to buy a site for construction of the Gainesville Public Library. Though she began work in 1908, Gunter became the first head librarian of the Gainesville Carnegie Public Library upon its completion in 1914. Shortly after its opening Gunter realized she was meeting the needs of the town, however, she was missing the rural population nearby. There was no plan at the time to reach the rural population and shortly after Gunter began working on a way to meet the needs of those in the outlying area. In an article authored by Laureen Jacobs of the Arlington Public Library in Texas, she writes, \\"Lillian Gunter referred to herself in her work diary as 'A progressive librarian in rural Texas'\\". Jacobs goes on to write, \\"she [Gunter] felt she needed more education, so she traveled, at her own expense, to the New York State Library School in Albany for a 6 week summer library training course. She also saved a place in the basement of the library for the African-American community of Gainesville. That must have been a very bold move, in her day. Gunter‚Äôs initial salary was $50 per month'\\".Pictured are three library staff inside the Gainesville Carnegie Public Library.Jacobs learned the above from a diary that Gunter wrote from 1921‚Äì1924. While handling librarian duties, Gunter along with county representative George W. Dayton worked on the Texas County Library Law which passed on March 5, 1917 and was signed by Governor of Texas James E. Ferguson. It was Lillian's goal to serve the whole county and not just the immediate area. To meet her goal she planned the creation of a county library. Though the first county library law would later be repealed, Lillian pushed for a second library law after getting advice from the California State Library during the administration of Milton J. Ferguson. The new law ‚Äì the 1919 Texas County Library Law ‚Äì passed and signed by Governor of Texas William P. Hobby.  Gainesville Carnegie Public Library (1913‚Äì1920)  The petition for a county library contained that of 1,361 signatures from individuals supporting its creation, which led to a vote for a bond of $125,000 for the new library. Gainesville Carnegie Public Library/The Cooke County Free Library was the second county library, the first being Dallam County Library, under the new Texas County Library Law and would grow to consist of 82 branches and a bookmobile that was in service. In 1913, a lot was designated for what would be called the Gainesville Carnegie Public Library. By October 10, 1914 the Gainesville Public Library began operations with a collection of 3,500 items. As promised the city council \\"very wisely have decided to charge only such a fee for its use as will cover janitor service, lights, and fuel making it free in a great many instances\\". Lillian Gunter wrote in a script that the site itself was \\"located on a corner lot on one of the best streets in the city, and one short block from the heart of the business district\\". The building was described as \\"very plain one-story and high basement structure of native cream colored pressed brick, dimensions 50' by 60'\\". Gunter would go on to describe the furniture and Library equipment as \\"of a most modern character throughout, and designed to give the most perfect library service\\". Inside the library was an auditorium, club-room, a museum on the bottom floor, offices, a large reading room reading room on the 2nd floor, and storage rooms. It was noted in a book by Wayne Nason that, \\"-material for the museum was collected by the librarian-consists of 13 shelves of fossils-early implements and arms, local history books, and manuscripts\\". There were Native American relics and when counted by Nason in 1928 the manuscripts totaled 262 articles. On the top floor it was \\"devoted to library purposes with children's and adults' reading room, stack room, and reference department simply separated from one another by arrangements of furniture\\". As for the aforementioned auditorium and club rooms on the bottom floor \\"there are two club rooms given over to the XLI Club, and an auditorium equipped with chairs and lights, drop curtains and a scenery painted by a local scene painter, and representing a view from the city park\\". The club rooms were often used by fellow community groups such as the \\"young men's club, of the mothers'clubs, the story hour, cooking demonstrations, meeting of the girls' training club, of the school board, and various other affairs\\". It was noted that these club rooms were open to public use as to \\"uplift the community and endear the public library to the people\\". During the initial years of the library's operation, Cooke County Representative George W. Dayton and Lillian Gunter began crafting the Texas County Library Law in 1915. That same year at the October, 1915 Texas Library Association conference in San Antonio, Texas-president of the association Elizabeth West \\"paid tribute to Miss Gunter\\". It's also noted that while there \\"this head of the Carnegie Library of San Antonio urge the Library Association to earnestly get at the task of furthering library interests in Texas\\". Though the law passed originally in 1917, it was repealed. With the newer and reworked Texas County Library Law of 1919, the law was petitioned in 1920 and led to a county library being established. Later, in 1921, the Gainesville Carnegie Public Library was renamed to the Cooke County Free Library in the spirit of the new library law.left  Cooke County Free Library (1921‚Äì1962)  In 1921 the Library reflected inward and made changes to their checkout system and stated \\"the new reader was given an application blank, which, when properly filled out, was numbered and filed both alphabetically and numerically\\". This helped with farmers forgetting their cards. J. James Brown goes on to tell that if a farmer \\"-had forgotten it, he gave his name. The files had been so carefully placed for convenience that it was a small matter to find his number from his name\\". At the 1922 State Fair of Texas the Gainesville Chamber of Commerce financed a library display for the exhibition that was held in Dallas. The exhibit contained \\"miniature town, farm and countryside, with a book on each subject illustrated in an endeavor to show the universal application of a country library service\\". In October 1924, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace presented the county library with \\"52 volumes of travel biography, letters, and treatises on international conditions\\". The corporation required that there be a section of shelves devoted to \\"The International Mind Alcove\\" area as it was expected that the Carnegie organization would add books to this section from \\"time to time\\". The University of Texas Geological Camp gifted the library a county wide map that \\"was a unique and interesting exhibit, showing the identifying formations for each of the 12 geological horizons in Cooke County\\". By the beginning of November 1924, the first oil well was established and men flocked to town to work the site. The Library was now in possession of the only geological map of Cooke County in existence. During its first month on display 114 men visited \\"The Oil Alcove\\" in the library. The head librarian gave it that name and then proceeded to take \\"all the maps of the county and adjacent territory and all bulletins and books on geology\\" and moved them to the front of the library to be part of \\"The Oil Alcove\\". By 1925 a new feature was moved to the library called \\"The Black and Grand Prairies of Texas\\" which drew a renewed attention from oil prospectors. The item was a land survey of Love County, Oklahoma and it also contained a collection of \\"some 10 or 15 well logs\\" of sites that have been previously drilled in and around Cooke County. In 1935 the Library was presented a portrait of Andrew Carnegie created by Luis Moya which was framed for permanent display as part of Andrew Carnegie's Centennial Celebration held by the Carnegie Corporation. The 1937 annual report showed that the libraries' growth were hitting new highs with the totals as follows: 18,703 volumes, a circulation of 76,221 books, and the registration of 9,379 patrons. This was an increase in circulation of 10,908 over the previous year. By 1941 annual report show that the Library's circulation hit 131,086 with 10,784 registered borrowers. left  Cynthia Wayne Martin  Cynthia Wayne Martin took over for Lillian Gunter upon her death in 1926. Under Martin more branches appeared and branches already in existence were updated. Her plan for further development involved acquiring a bookmobile that would travel to branch locations, schools, and businesses. The bookmobile was first manned by Librarian Carrie Hudspeath and by a Mr. Emmett Cameron. The mobile was able to carry some 2,000 books to and from locations. Notably, Martin helped the county schools acquire books by combining funds between the library and the schools, most went to the bookmobile to travel between other stations and branches that serviced the schools' population. Over time, this new library on wheels led to the closing of many stations and branches as stated by Librarian Ann Woods in a later record. At the time schools were consolidating while several communities were dwindling, and due to the Gilmer-Aikman Bill in 1950‚Äì1951 which required schools to have their own onsite library. After the need for the bookmobile diminished, it was retired. Martin was also allowed to manage the training of all library personnel under the new Works Progress Administration's act, a plan that was put into action by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 6, 1935. Martin retired on January 10, 1939 and Head Librarian Olna Catis Boaz assumed leadership of the library.  Olna Catis Boaz  By 1939 the library began to face changes. \\"-the W.P.A.[Works Progress Administration] project went out of existence. Library service was hampered and county branches showed drops in circulation\\". Head Librarian Olna Boaz saw a need and along with fellow librarian Carrie Hudspeath-drove the bookmobile to library stations and branches themselves. Mrs. Boaz talked up the bookmobile and took every chance to mention the \\"library on wheels\\" to fellow librarians at the Texas Library Association Meetings. 1940 showed \\"an increase in service to schools over former facilities\\". However, when the Gilmer-Aiken Bill became effective in 1950‚Äì1951, schools were required to have libraries built on site. The choice to redistribute the books was made and the bookmobile became non-existent. 1942 saw the growth of Camp Howze as World War II raged on. With Camp Howze expanding population the \\"branches at Mossville, Warrens Bend, and Marysville, and Mount Hope were closed and the books were returned to the main library due to the army camp\\". A donation of \\"nearly 400\\" books was received from a drive held in Dallas and these books were put to use due in part to the library being \\"in a defense area and having insufficient resources for the severe strain that was put on it\\". The library even expanded hours till 8:00 pm with the increased population held at Camp Howze. The post- war plan was to found and establish a new library. This would mean an increase in budget to meet the American Library Association's guidelines as to meet the requirements for zones that had a population that was under 25,000. At the time it was found that the \\"present building was entirely inadequate even for present needs\\". The plan pushed to reconstruct the \\"old building\\" for office of other use while commencing construction on a new campus for the library. By 1946 Mrs. Boaz had gone back to school for teaching and later resigned and went to teach in Denton, Texas. Mrs. Hudspeth was made the next Head Librarian and continued down the path for a new library to be constructed.  Cooke County Library (1963‚Äìpresent)  After voters agreed to a bond for a new library building, construction began in 1962. Cooke County Library opened its doors on June 29, 1963 in Gainesville, Texas at 200 South Weaver and to this day is the current site of the library. The Gainesville Carnegie Public Library now serves as a building for the Arts Council and the Butterfield Stage Theater. The contract for construction was given to Jack Owens in the fall of 1962 and the architects chosen for the construction were Pond and Bellamy of Wichita Falls, Texas.  Cooke County Library Association and the Cooke County Bibliography Project  In October 1985 Cooke County Library Association (which consisted of library employees and its Friends of the Library) had its first meeting and decided to work alongside the Cooke County Sesquicentennial Committee and the Cultural Affairs Committee to compile a Cooke County Bibliography as a \\"special project\\" covering a list of sources and peoples' heritage that would be accessible to future generations and located at both the Cooke County Library and the Morton Museum in Gainesville, Texas. At the time there were three separate, smaller reports that covered happenings, families, and places. The groups decided to place these three reports as a foundation for a bigger project that covered all of Cooke County. Copies of the report were passed out to libraries within the county. The names of Cooke County librarians that assisted with the project can be found on the last page of the Cooke County Bibliography Special Project for the Sesquicentennial. Listed below are the names of Cooke County librarians that assisted with the special project and they are written as shown on the last page of the report: * Sylvia Bayer * Ann Cogburn * Sandy Corbett * Joy Davidson * Sylvia Lyons * Sandra Moore * Frances Moses * Mary Moster * Sister Carmelita Myers * Patsy Sloan * Mary Townsley * Patsy Wilson * Ann Woods = Ann Woods = Mrs. Ann Woods, Head Librarian of the Cooke County Library took over for Mrs. Cora Neely in 1977.

Woods also assisted the Cooke County Library Association, Cooke County Sesquicentennial Committee, Cultural Affairs Committee and other Cooke County Librarians with the Cooke County Bibliography Project.

Noel was the 7th son of Baptist Noel, 3rd Viscount Campden, and his fourth wife Lady Elizabeth Bertie, daughter of Montague Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey and was born on 7 November 1659. He entered Middle Temple in 1676 but still had chambers at the Middle Temple in 1681. Late in the summer of 1687, he had a quarrel at a horse-race meeting with Bennet Sherard, 2nd Baron Sherard who resorted to physical violence. This created such a stir among the local gentry that Lord Sunderland, secretary of state instructed Lord Huntingdon lord lieutenant of Leicestershire to see that the difference was smoothed over. In time it was, as Sherard became the father-in-law of Noel when his daughter Elizabeth Lady Irvine (or Irwin), widow of Edward Ingram, 2nd Viscount of Irvine, married him on 27 May 1696. Elizabeth was the sister and coheir of Bennet Sherard, 1st Earl of Harborough, and had at least two children by Noel: *Bridget (died 1729), who married David Colyear, Viscount Milsington, heir to the Earl of Portmore *Thomas (died 1788), who married Elizabeth ChapmanMosley, Charles, editor.

The offensive followed the Hawija offensive by the Iraqi Government, and was also concurrent with several major offensives in Syria: the Syrian Democratic Forces' Deir ez-Zor offensive, and the Syrian Government's Battle of Deir ez-Zor and Eastern Syria campaign on the opposite side of the Al-Qa'im border crossing. Background Al-Qa'im was known as a hotbed of jihadist insurgency, after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with coalition forces carrying out repeated operations against Al-Qaeda jihadists. The strategic and porous border started becoming a route for foreign fighters entering Iraq from Syria, who was accused by Iraqi Government of ignoring it. The towns of western Anbar were captured by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in 2014. Before the 2017 offensive, Iraqi forces had dislodged the group from key cities of Anbar including Ramadi and Fallujah but the areas near border with Syria including Anah, Rawa, Al-Qaim and the vast rural areas across the province remained under militant control. An Iraqi operation was launched towards west Anbar in January 2017, but was suspended after recapture of towns of Sagra and Zawiya because of preparations for retaking the western bank of Mosul. In September 2017, the Iraqi Army launched an offensive in the western Anbar Province, recapturing the towns of Akashat on 16September and Anah on 21September. After recapturing Hawija on 5October Iraqi Army was expected to fight ISIL in Anbar. Instead, it paused its military actions and later started advancing on Kirkuk. The campaign Al-Qaim Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced an offensive to recapture the western border region of al-Qaim and Rawa on 26October. He stated, \\"The heroic legions are advancing into the last den of terrorism in Iraq to liberate al-Qaim, Rawa and the surrounding villages and hamlets.\\" Iraqi forces including the troops, police, Sunni tribesmen and mostly Shia militias, participated in the assault. Later, Lieutenant-General Abdul Amir Yarallah announced that they had cleared Umm al-Waz village, south- east of al-Qa'im, and the H-2 Air Base, along with the nearby Husseiniyat area, south of al-Qaim. According to the United Nations, around 50,000 people were still in al-Qaim and Rawa. Meanwhile, Walid al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi army colonel, told Anadolu Agency that they had captured Rawa intersection and the Jabbab district, which is about west of Rawa. Iraqi Army's War Media Cell announced on 27October that the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU) had secured of the Akashat-al-Qaim road and an area of 301 km¬≤ (116.2 sq mi) (south of al- Qa'im. It also added that PMU captured al-Qakm cement plant, al-Qaom Quarries, al-Qaim station and the water station. Iraqi Army meanwhile captured villages of Awani, northern Jabab and al-Zalla on southern bank of Euphrates. Army Major-General Qasim al-Muhammadi told Anadolu Agency on the same day that 25 militants were killed in a clash between Iraqi Army and ISIL near T1 area, of al-Qa'im. He added that a large number of militants also retreated to center of al-Qaim district. Ahmed al-Dulaimi, an Anbar police captain, stated that five militants and two tribal fighters were killed in the same area a day earlier. The Joint Operations Command (JOC) stated on 28October that pro-Iraqi forces had taken control of large areas to east of al-Qaim, after routing the militants from their hideouts. It also stated that the Iraqi troops had also captured many villages, a bridge on the Euphrates, the al-Qaim railway station, a military airbase, and the Akkas gas field. The JOC added that so far, 75 militants had been killed, while nine SVBIEDs, 10 militant vehicles, and four bomb-making sites had been destroyed, while 378 roadside bombs were defused or detonated. The JOC also reported that 33 villages had been recaptured from ISIL, within 2 days of the offensive. The Defence Ministry stated on 29October that Iraqi aeroplanes had dropped thousands of leaflets in ISIL-held areas of Anbar, urging militants to surrender. An Iraqi security source stated on the same day that ISIL fighters had fled towards Al-Bukamal in Syria, after many leaders fled and were killed in airstrikes. Meanwhile, Qatari al-Samarmad, a PMU commander, stated that Ra'ed al-Atouri, the ISIL military official of al-Qa'im, and six of his companions had been killed by Iraqi warplanes. By 31October, Iraqi forces had reached the edge of al-Qaim. The JOC announced that Iraqi forces, backed by United States' aerial strikes and Sunni tribal fighters, had captured the village of al-Obeidi, adding that even though ISIL resisted the advance of the troops, the majority retreated to centre of al-Qaim. Yarallah stated that they had also captured a cement plant and a phosphate processing facility. He added that they also took control of a nearby residential complex, nine villages around Obeidi as well as large areas of Akkas gas field. Army Brigadier-General Numaan Abdul-Zobai said that they also captured villages of Rafedah and Al-Kasim to west of al-Qaim. Minister of Oil Jabar al-Luaibi stated on 2 November that Iraq forces had captured the Akkas gas field. Major-General Numaan Abd al-Zawbaei, commander of the army's 7th Division, said on the same day that regular troops backed by the PMU had captured Al-Saada area, and the nearby villages of Jereejib and Qunaitera, west of Al-Qaim, killing several militants and destroying a number of booby- trapped vehicles. United States Army artillery provides fire support for Iraqi security forces near al-Qa'im, 7November 2017 On 3November, the Iraqi Army captured the Abu Kamal-Al-Qa'im border crossing. The JOC announced they had entered al-Qa'im as well. The PMU captured the town's train station, as well as the al-Karabilah neighbourhood during the day, while also entering the Gaza neighbourhood. Later on the same day, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced that Iraqi Government forces had captured al-Qa'im. Iraqi Government forces also recaptured the rest of the Al-Qa'im District. This stripped ISIL of all its border crossings along the Iraqi‚ÄìSyrian border, and left only Rawa under ISIL rule. Interlude Following the loss of the border city of Al-Qa'im and Deir ez-Zor, Al-Bukamal in Syria was the last town of note under their full control, where they were expected to make their final stand. ISIL forces also began massing at Al-Bukamal, boosted by the retreating ISIL fighters from Iraq. On 5November, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) claimed that ISIL had driven out PMU out of Al-Bukamal's countryside. However Kata'ib Hezbollah spokesman Jaafar al-Husseini stated that they clashed with ISIL just metres from border with Syria and fired rockets into Syria, adding that their forces did not cross into Syria. Rawa Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi stated on 11November that the Iraqi forces were launching an operation to push militants out of an area in western Iraq. The offensive to recapture Rawa was launched during the day. Two Iraqi divisions and Sunni tribal fighters carried out the operation. Yarallah said that the troops had captured Rumana and its bridge, along with 10 other villages. Iraqi Army Col.

He stated: \\"Liberation of Rawa district in mere hours reflects the great strength and power of our heroic armed forces and the successful planning for battles.\\" A military spokesman stated, \\"With the liberation of Rawa we can say all the areas in which Daesh is present have been liberated.\\" He added that Iraqi forces will pursue the militants who fled into the desert and exert control over Iraq's borders.

On 23November, Iraqi forces announced the launch of an offensive to clear the desert bordering Syria. Army, police and paramilitary units advanced into areas of Saladin, Nineveh and Anbar Governorates forming part of the region called al-Jazira. Iraqi forces stated on 24November that ISIL was withdrawing deep into the desert to escape the offensive. The PMF stated its forces had taken control of 77 villages since the launch of the offensive.

Headlined by the retirement match of Kenta Kobashi, all in all, the event featured seven matches and wrestlers from not only Noah, but also All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), Diamond Ring, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and Tenryu Project. Due to Kobashi's high-profile status in the history of Japanese professional wrestling, the event gained mainstream attention in the country. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter called the event the \\"end of an era in Japanese pro wrestling\\", drawing parallels to Pel√©'s 1977 retirement from football. Production Background Kenta Kobashi in November 2007 On December 3, 2012, the Tokyo Sports newspaper reported that Pro Wrestling Noah had decided to terminate the contract of veteran wrestler Kenta Kobashi due to financial issues. Kobashi had been with Noah since its inception in 2000 and had been the reigning All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion, when he left AJPW to follow Mitsuharu Misawa to the newly-created promotion. Kobashi then became the catalyst in a period, where Noah enjoyed great success with Nippon Budokan sellouts and classic matches. At a time when mixed martial arts was doing strong business in Japan and professional wrestling was seen as the \\"old fake version\\", Kobashi's drawing power kept Noah the most popular professional wrestling promotion in the country. However, while the promotion had once been considered one of the best in the world, it had recently fallen on hard times. First Kobashi started suffering from various injuries, which quickly took a toll on Noah's popularity. Kobashi's hard hitting style meant that by the age of 24, his knees were described as being \\"thrashed\\" and by the age of 33, he had had more than a dozen operations. Kobashi also battled kidney cancer, which sidelined him for 17 months in early 2006. None of the wrestlers designed to replace Kobashi at the top of Noah had his charisma or drawing power and eventually the promotion lost its network television contract. Following Misawa's death in the ring in 2009, the promotion started to unravel with financial issues and dissension in the front office. Despite not having wrestled in almost a year, Kobashi was the highest paid worker in Noah and by December 2012 the company simply could no longer afford him. Jun Akiyama was one of five wrestlers to resign from Noah after the company decided to terminate Kobashi's contract Noah's decision to cut Kobashi led to an immediate backlash from wrestlers loyal to him with Atsushi Aoki, Go Shiozaki, Jun Akiyama, Kotaro Suzuki and Yoshinobu Kanemaru announcing their resignation from the promotion. The five ended up joining AJPW after their contracts with Noah expired at the end of the year, forming a new version of the Burning stable, which had originally been formed by Kobashi and Akiyama in 1998. On December 9, 2012, Kobashi appeared at Noah's Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan event, announcing his retirement from professional wrestling, having deemed it impossible to fully recover from the accumulation of his injuries. Stating that he wanted to wrestle one final match, Kobashi added that he was not being forced to retire. Originally Kobashi planned to have his retirement match on February 26, 2013, which would have been the 25th anniversary of his debut, but quickly realized he needed more time to get into ring shape, which led to the date being pushed back to May 11, 2013. The date was confirmed on January 23, and on March 31, it was announced that Kobashi's retirement match would be an eight-man tag team match, where he, Jun Akiyama, Keiji Mutoh and Kensuke Sasaki would take on Go Shiozaki, Kenta, Maybach Taniguchi and Yoshinobu Kanemaru. Out of his partners, Kobashi was particularly close to Akiyama, with the history between the two dating back 20 years to their junior days in AJPW. The entire team opposing Kobashi was made up of his prot√©g√©s. Tokyo's Nippon Budokan was chosen as the arena for the show. Despite Noah's recent difficulties, it was considered a \\"given\\" that the promotion could sell out Nippon Budokan for the show, while Tokyo Dome was deemed \\"too big of a risk\\". Kobashi also had significant history with Nippon Budokan. Big matches in his early career as well as his tag team tournament and Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship wins had taken place in the arena and during his two-year run as the GHC Heavyweight Champion, Noah held its big shows in the arena. Yoshihiko Noda, the former Prime Minister of Japan and a self-professed fan of Kobashi, attended the event Kobashi's retirement event received significant coverage in mainstream media in Japan. Several magazines ran special editions dedicated entirely to Kobashi. The event was streamed into movie theaters across Japan. Every theater in Tokyo was sold out, most well ahead of time. Japan's former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda, who had stated that Kobashi was his favorite wrestler, announced that he would attend the event. Kobashi trained for the match at the Pro Wrestling Noah dojo, where he had trained since the promotion's founding in 2000. He would enter his final match weighing . This would mark his first match in 455 days. Event The show was opened by an appearance by Hayabusa, who had been paralyzed in the ring in 2001. With help from crutches, he walked to the ring and talked about taking a lariat from Kobashi in Nippon Budokan. In the opening match of the show, Masanobu Fuchi defeated Hitoshi Kumano with the backdrop. Fuchi was one of Kobashi's original trainers and the match was designed to show him now, a generation later, training the recently debuted Kumano. In the second match, Atsushi Kotoge and Taiji Ishimori took on Genba Hirayanagi and Suwa. During the match, former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda, who was seated in the front row, took part in a spot, where Hirayanagi recreated a spit spot made famous by Haruka Eigen. During the match, Suwa suffered a spinal injury and was stretchered out of the arena, after Ishimori pinned Hirayanagi with the 450¬∞ splash to end the match. The third match featured Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki facing Kentaro Shiga and Tamon Honda. Aoki and Suzuki had quit Noah in protest over Kobashi's treatment and were now representing AJPW. Honda was Kobashi's training partner for years and at one point his regular tag team partner. The match was billed as \\"Burning vs. Burning\\", with Aoki and Suzuki being part of the new Burning stable in AJPW, while Shiga and Honda had been part of the earlier version of the group. Aoki and Suzuki won the match with Suzuki pinning Shiga for the win with the Endless Waltz. After the third match, Kobashi came out to the ring for his retirement ceremony, which was also attended by wrestlers Akira Taue, Hiroshi Hase, Masahiro Chono, Masanobu Fuchi, Mitsuo Momota, Takeshi Rikio and Toshiaki Kawada as well as Asuka Kuramochi from AKB48 and Yoshihiko Noda among others. The ceremony also included a written statement from John Laurinaitis, Kobashi's on-and-off tag team partner in the 90s, and a pre-taped promo from Stan Hansen. The fourth match of the show saw Genichiro Tenryu and Yoshinari Ogawa defeat Masao Inoue and Takeshi Morishima. The fifth match featured the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) trio of Hiroshi Tanahashi, Satoshi Kojima and Yuji Nagata taking on the Noah trio of Akitoshi Saito, Muhammad Yone and Takashi Sugiura. The NJPW wrestlers, Tanahashi in particular, were booed by the Noah crowd. Tanahashi won the match for his team by pinning Saito with the High Fly Flow. Kobashi's prot√©g√© Kenta, the reigning GHC Heavyweight Champion, took part in the main event The sixth match featured the reunion of No Fear as Takao Omori and Yoshihiro Takayama, who had teamed together in both AJPW and Noah, took on Minoru Suzuki and Naomichi Marufuji. No Fear won the match with Takayama pinning Marufuji with the Everest German Suplex Hold. The main event of the show was the retirement match of Kenta Kobashi, where he teamed with Jun Akiyama, Keiji Mutoh and Kensuke Sasaki to take on Go Shiozaki, Kenta, Maybach Taniguchi and Yoshinobu Kanemaru. Kobashi came to the ring wearing an old version of the GHC Heavyweight Championship belt. He had not actually held the title since 2005, but was considered both the greatest champion in the title's history as well as the man most synonymous with the title, nicknamed the . The match featured Kobashi doing several of his signature moves, including the Cobra Twist, half nelson suplex, rolling cradle and 187 chops. At the end, he hit Kanemaru with a superplex and a lariat, but his pin attempt was broken up by Kanemaru's partners. Akiyama then hit Taniguchi with an exploder suplex and Sasaki hit a German suplex on Kenta, while Mutoh hit a backbreaker and a moonsault on Kanemaru. Akiyama, Mutoh and Sasaki then all signaled for Kobashi, who hit a body slam on Kanemaru and then climbed the ropes for the final moonsault of his career, which won the match for his team. After the conclusion of the match, the ring and ringside area were filled with wrestlers. Kobashi's wife and mother also came to the ring for his retirement speech. After a ten-bell salute to signal the end of Kobashi's career, his greatest accomplishments were read out loud after which the event concluded with his theme song \\"Grand Sword\\" being played in Nippon Budokan. Aftermath In June 2014, Kobashi started producing his own independent events under the banner of \\"Fortune Dream\\". In addition to putting together the cards, featuring wrestlers from multiple promotions, Kobashi would participate in the shows in sit-down interview segments with fellow veteran wrestlers, including Genichiro Tenryu and Riki Choshu. By the end of 2015, Go Shiozaki, Kotaro Suzuki and Yoshinobu Kanemaru, three of the five wrestlers who had quit Noah in protest, had quit AJPW. Shiozaki and Kanemaru quickly returned to Noah, with Shiozaki re-signing with the promotion in June 2016. Akiyama and Aoki remain in AJPW, with Akiyama having taken over as the promotion's president in July 2014. Kensuke Sasaki, one of the veteran wrestlers who had teamed with Kobashi in the main event of the show, announced his retirement on February 13, 2014. Unlike Kobashi, Sasaki decided against doing a retirement match, with his final match having already taken place two days earlier.

In opening her college, she had the cooperation of those who induced her to establish such a school in Boston, but the underlying ideas, the scientific rules for dress- cutting, the patented system used, and all the methods of instruction, were her own. The chief aim of the institution was to be one in which girls of ability and taste, who were engaged in stores, workshops and kitchens, could find employment for which they were better adapted. Brown's system of cutting was the result of years of study. All its points she had thoroughly mastered, and had succeeded in patenting rules for cutting, and also obtained the only patent for putting work together. She received numerous medals and diplomas as testimonials of the superiority of her methods, and her system was used the leading industrial schools and colleges of the country. Delegates from the Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York, after investigating all the principal European methods, adopted Brown's system. It was one of the regular features of the Moody Schools, Northfield, Massachusetts, where young women were educated for missionary work. Brown was an occasional contributor to the newspaper press. In 1902 she wrote \\"Scientific dress cutting and making, \\"The Harriet A. Brown system,\\" simplified and improved; directions for its use\\". Personal life Harriet A. Brown married Albert G. Brown (1848-1935) and had two children: Walter G. (1871-1872) and Clara G. (1886-1895). She died in 1930 and is buried at Brown Cemetery, Voluntown, New London, Connecticut.

The poem begins: \\"Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep\\". It was included in school readers and books on elocution, receiving general recognition as a work of merit. Publication history Dr. Robert Looney Caruthers White, of Nashville, who was authority on literary matters, came to the rescue when the poem's authorship was brought into question. In Trotwood's Monthly he commented: \\"In your March issue, reprinting the familiar poem, \\"The Old Canoe,\\" which the anthology-makers so persistently ascribe to the late Gen. Albert Pike, you say: \\"Like many other good poems, It was, perhaps, the only one some poet wrote, and, never thinking itt would be immortal, or that it had any special merit, failed to sign his name to it. . . . Its authorship has never before, perhaps, been publicly corrected.\\" Both these statements are erroneous. Nine years ago, when Miss Jennie Thornley Clarke's \\"Songs of the South\\" was published, it contained this poem, marked \\"anonymous.\\" As I chanced to know its real authorship, and hence knew that it lacked several hundreds of miles, geographically speaking, of being a \\"song of the South,\\" I sent a communication to the New York Critic, which was printed in its issue of March 13, 1897, giving the facts. I have several times since publicly corrected the statement that General Albert Pike was the author of the poem. The actual author was Miss Emily Rebecca Page, who was born in Bradford, Vt., in 1834, and died in Chelsea, Mass., in 1862. \\"The Old Canoe\\" was written in 1849, and appeared in the Portland Transcript in that year. It was not by any means \\"the only one the poet wrote.\\" Miss Page was a voluminous writer of both verse and prose, having been a constant contributor to many New England periodicals. She was later assistant editor of Gleason's Pictorial and The Flag of Our Union, two Boston literary publications which were very popular forty or fifty years ago. She also published several volumes of poetry. -R. L. C. WHITE. Nashville, February 26, 1906.\\" It was suggested that the authorship of the poem was fastened upon Pike because about the time of its publication, when it was going the rounds of the press, probably without any credit, a doggerel called \\"The Old Canoe\\" was composed about Pike by one of his political foes, the subject of it being a canoe in which he left Columbia, Tennessee, when a young man practicing law in that place. Pike himself stated to Senator Edward W. Carmack that he was not the author of \\"The Old Canoe,\\" and could not imagine how he ever got the credit for it. Elizabeth Akers Allen also addressed the error in author attribution in Carleton's Record of the Year: A Reference Scrap Book saying, \\"By a natural enough mistake, or rather a repetition of another's mistake, you print in your Record for June, crediting it to Albert Pike, a poem entitled \\" The Old Canoe.\\" It is not his, having been written originally by a young girl, Miss Emily Rebecca Page, a native of Bradford, Vermont. She was born and passed most of her short life in a quiet place on the Vermont bank of the Connecticut river, near the \\"toll-bridge,\\" which was mentioned last week in the papers as having been carried off by the freshet, near Piermont. I am positive about the matter, as I was well acquainted with her in her school-days. I had occasion to correct this same error in a New York daily two or three years ago. If my name is strange to you, I can refer you to Mr. B. P. Shillaber, of Chelsea, Massachusetts, who will assure you that I am in the right, as he was a friend of Miss Page when she was copy-holder in the office of Bailors Pictorial, Boston. She was not more than sixteen or seventeen years of age when she wrote this poem, notably her best, although it bears evidence of the youth and inexperience of the writer. Poetry, I know, is rather a drug in the market, but even verse-writers have their rights, and should not be cheated of their own, especially after they are dead, and cannot defend themselves.\\" References Bibliography External links * Lyrics & Love Songs: Gen.

It belongs to the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising. It is the oldest church in Holzkirchen. The date of its founding is unknown, though is thought to be around the year 1000. For much of its history, it was run by Tegernsee Abbey. The church (along with 15 houses) was destroyed in a fire in 1490. It was rebuilt in 1493, but further fires followed in 1532 (when the whole market was destroyed), 1562 and 1586. A complete rebuild occurred in 1704-1711 under the aegis of the abbot of Tegernsee, but further fires struck in 1728, 1777 and 1802. The church records on each occasion were destroyed. Tegernsee Abbey was finally secularised and closed in 1803. The church tower was removed owing to structural deterioration in 1830. It was replaced with the current one in 1838. The bells came back into use in 1840. Holzkirchen became a separate parish in 1855. The church continued to be afflicted by fires in 1841, 1844 and 1861. In 1882-86, many of the baroque fittings were removed, though this meant that they were saved from further fires in 1885 and 1895. They were not restored to their intended locations until an extensive redecoration scheme for the church was completed in 1967. Gallery File:Holzkirchen-St. Laurentius-2.jpgSt Laurentius interior.

These standards are developed by governments, child care experts, pediatricians, and parent advocacy groups. This information is useful for parents who are seeking quality child care and for directors and staff working in child care settings for ensuring quality settings and programs. Description Indicators of quality child care include ratios of staff to children, Childhood experiences in quality child care settings have been linked to positive development and experiences later in life. Barriers for access to quality child care have also been identified. Cross-national comparisons regarding costs and participation in child care programs have been reported on. In recent years, Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) has been included by the United Nations as a target in their Millennium Development Goals project and has been identified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as an important area for future policy development. Standards of quality Sets of child care indicators have developed globally and in some cases, nationally. While no universally accepted list of indicators or standards exists, some of the indicators that are largely accepted for quality child care are: * Adequate supervision *Hand washing and diapering policies * Director qualifications * Lead teacher qualifications * Ratio and group size *Immunization policies *Toxic substances policies * Emergency plans *Fire drills *Child abuse reporting policies *Medications policies * Staff training/first aid * Playground safety Positive development ECEC provides children with the necessary cognitive, social, and emotional skills for learning in the future. Quality child care that is guided by indicators provides play opportunities and activities that are designed for practicing these skills. Providing families with opportunities to access quality child care provides a basis for sustainable development and improved individual performance over time, for both children and parents. Barriers Quality child care is not consistently available currently. Some of the barriers to quality child care include: * Funding - Public funding for child care is not distributed equally for all child care centers. Centers with less funding have less access to the tools required to meet the standards for quality child care. * Licensing and regulation - Some areas lack governance that requires child care facilities to operate according to recognized standards * Child care providers - Educators do not consistently receive adequate compensation for their work. Some do not have access to educational tools to provide them with ongoing training and skills development. * Lack of guidelines for curriculum development - ECEC is not consistently delivered and does not benefit children and families equally In North America, no federal regulations for indicators or standards have been developed that would address these barriers consistently.

The Flamicell, or Flamisell is a river in the province of Pallars, Catalonia, Spain. It is 34 km long and is a tributary of the Noguera Pallaresa. This river is known for the variation in flow depending on the time of the year and the meteorological conditions. The flow is also very strong because it brings water from many different lakes, one of them being the Lake Gento (see Cabdella Lakes). In 1937, the flow was so strong that it destroyed the hydroelectric station in Cabdella and brought to La Pobla de Segur a flow of 700 m¬≥/s. Its name is derived from the Latin word flamicellu which means small river.  Course  The source of the river is in Cabdella and it flows south passing the town of La Pobleta de Bellvei and the village of La Plana de Mont-ros. Two tributaries join it and the river reaches its maximum width. A few kilometres later it passes La Pobla de Segur and joins the river of Noguera Pallaresa just above the Sant Antoni reservoir.  Hydroelectric energy  This river has been used to generate hydroelectric energy for more than a hundred years. There are four hydroelectric power stations along the river located at La Pobla de Segur, Cabdella, La Plana de Mont-ros and Molinos.  Conditions  This river has a very good oxygen saturation of a 77% and 5 mg/l of nitrates. That indicates that the river is in very good natural conditions.  Fish  The main fish that live in this river is the common trout. It has been confirmed that the 95% of this species, opposite from the salmon, do not reach the sea. Also the 95% of the common trout that live in this river have an average movement of fifty meters. Which means that only a 5% of them travel for distances longer than 500 meters.

A pair of related 1,2-dimethyldiboranes are also known. It is a colorless gas that ignites in air. Formation The methylboranes were first prepared by H. I. Schlesinger and A. O. Walker in the 1930s. Methylboranes are formed by the reaction of diborane and trimethylborane. This reaction produces four different substitution of methyl with hydrogen on diborane. Produced are 1-methyldiborane, 1,1-dimethyldborane, 1,1,2-trimethyldiborane, and 1,1,2,2-tetramethyldiborane. Tetramethyl lead reacts with diborane in a 1,2-dimethoxyethane solvent at room temperature to make a range of methyl substituted diboranes, ending up at trimethylborane, but including 1,1-dimethyldiborane, and trimethyldiborane. The other outputs of the reaction are hydrogen gas and lead metal. Other methods to form methyldiboranes include heating trimethylborane with hydrogen. Alternatively trimethylborane reacts with borohydride salts with in the presence of hydrogen chloride, aluminium chloride, or boron trichloride. If the borohydride is sodium borohydride, then methane is a side product. If the metal is lithium then no methane is produced. dimethylchloroborane and methyldichloroborane are also produced as gaseous products. When Cp2Zr(CH3)2 reacts with borane dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, a borohydro group inserts into the zirconium carbon bond, and methyl diboranes are produced. In ether dimethylcalcium reacts with diborane to produce dimethyldiborane and calcium borohydride: :Ca(CH3)2 + 2 B2H6 ‚Üí Ca(BH4)2 + B2H4(CH3)2 1,2-dimethyldiborane slowly converts on standing to 1,1-dimethyldiborane. Gas chromatography can be used to determine the amounts of the methyl boranes in a mixture. The order they elute are diborane, monomethyldiborane, trimethylborane, 1,1-dimethyldiborane, 1,2-dimethyldiborane, trimethyldiborane, and finally tetramethyldiborane. Selected properties 1,1-Dimethyldiborane has a dipole moment of 0.87 d. The predicted heat of formation for the liquid is ŒîH0f=-31 kcal/mol, and for the gas -25 kcal/mol. Heat of vapourisation was measured at 5.5 kcal/mol. Reactions At ‚àí78.5 ¬∞C, methyldiborane disproportionates slowly, first to diborane and 1,1-dimethyldiborane. In solution methylborane is more stable against disproportionation than dimethylborane. :2 MeB2H5 ‚Üí 1,1-Me2B2H4 + B2H6, K = 2.8, Me = CH3 :3 [1,1-Me2B2H4] ‚Üí 2 Me3B2H3 + B2H6, K = 0.00027 Trimethyldiborane partially disproportionates over a period of hours at room temperature to yield tetramethyldiborane and 1,2-dimethyldiborane. Over a period of weeks 1,1-dimethyldiborane appears as well. Gentler oxidation of 1,1-dimethyldiborane at 80 ¬∞C yields 2,5-dimethyl-1,3,4-trioxadiboralane, a volatile liquid that contains a ring of two boron and three oxygen atoms. An intermediate in this reaction is two molecules of dimethylborylhydroperoxide (CH3)2BOOH. (CAS 41557-62-5) When methyldiborane is oxidised around 150 ¬∞C a similar substance methyltrioxadiboralane is produced. At the same time dimethyltrioxadiboralane and trimethylboroxine are also formed, and also hydrocarbons, diborane, hydrogen, and dimethoxyborane (dimethyl methylboronic ester).

His father died in 1718 and his brother John on 6 January 1728 so he succeeded to the family estate at Walcot in Northamptonshire. In 1730 he established his pack of hounds, initially at Exton in Rutland and he became the first master of the Cottesmore Hunt, as they were named after he moved them to Cottesmore in 1740. As an authority on hound breeding, he published the first book on the subject in 1732. Political career The Noel family had represented Rutland since the middle of the sixteenth century. In 1728 Noel was elected Member of Parliament for Rutland in a by-election caused by the death of his brother who held the seat. He was re-elected unopposed at Rutland with his cousin James Noel in 1734. He did not stand at the 1741 general election. Noel was again returned at Rutland in a by-election in 1753 after the death of James Noel. In 1754 he topped the poll in the contested election at Rutland. He married Elizabeth Chapman, daughter of William Chapman, gamekeeper at Exton and widow of his cousin Baptist Noel, 4th Earl of Gainsborough on 6 November 1756. At the 1761 election he topped the poll in the contest at Rutland again. After 1766 his attendance at parliament became irregular. He was returned unopposed at subsequent elections in 1768 and 1774.

The parent member of this entire class is HGeGeH, which has only been characterized computationally, but has revealed key features of the whole class. Because of the large interatomic repulsion between two Ge atoms, only kinetically stabilized digermyne molecules can be synthesized and characterized by utilizing bulky protecting groups and appropriate synthetic methods, for example, reductive coupling of germanium(II) halides. The bonding between two Ge atoms in digermyne is different from C‚â°C bond in alkynes, which results in the trans-bent structure of digermyne. Trans-bent structure is quite common in heavier Group 14 element analogues of alkynes. The second order Jahn-Teller (SOJT) effect of digermynes gives rise to slipped œÄ-bond and large molecular geometrical distortion. Because of the multibonded feature of digermynes and the large interatomic repulsion of two Ge atoms, which therefore leads to the long germanium- germanium distance, digermynes are very reactive and can undergo different kinds of reactions, such as [2+1] and [2+2] cycloaddition reaction with different kinds of unsaturated molecules, [4+1] cycloaddition with 1,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, addition reaction of alcohols and water, and act as œÄ-electron donor to undergo coordination reaction with silver ion.  Preparation  Although many computational studies have calculated the structures and energies of the parent molecule HGeGeH and digermynes with organic substitutes, they can be only synthesized and isolated upon the protection of bulky R groups. It has been proven that the synthetic strategy that reducing proper precursor, usually germanium(II) halides with bulky protection groups, by strong reductants is powerful for synthesizing digermynes.  Reductive coupling of germanium(II) halides  The crystal structure of Ar1GeGeAr1. The first stable digermyne 2,6-Dipp2H3C6GeGeC6H3-2,6-Dipp2 (Ar1GeGeAr1, Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) was synthesized and characterized by Philip P. Power and co-workers in 2002. Reductive coupling of bulky 2,6-Dipp2-C6H3 (Ar1) group protected Ge(II) monochloride (Ge(Cl)Ar1) under the treatment of potassium in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or benzene gave the formation of Ar1GeGeAr1. The core structure C1-Ge1-Ge2-C2 has a centrosymmetric trans-bent feature, with the C1-Ge1-Ge2 angle of 128.67(8)¬∞ and a considerably short distance of 2.2850(6) √Ö between two Ge atoms. It has a good conjugation between two terphenyl rings and C1-Ge1-Ge2-C2 plain because of the nearly zero torsion angle (0.4¬∞) presented. Similar molecule, designated Ar2GeGeAr2 has been calculated before the characterization of Ar1GeGeAr1, with the optimized trans-bent core structure protected by even more crowded 2,6-Trip2C6H2 (Ar2, Trip = 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl) groups. The trans bending in Ar2GeGeAr2 (123.2¬∞) is comparable with Ar1GeGeAr1, and the Ge-Ge distance of 2.277 √Ö also differs little from that of Ar1GeGeAr1. Ar2GeGeAr2 was obtained using the same reduction method and afforded the structure similar to the calculated one and Ar1GeGeAr1. The synthesis of digermyne 2,6-Dipp2H3C6GeGeC6H3-2,6-Dipp2 (Ar1GeGeAr1) Similar synthetic method was used to facilitate the synthesis of a digermyne LGeGeL with a Ge-Ge single bond. Instead of taking advantage of bulky ligands with carbon as coordinating atom, nitrogen-based protecting group L (L = N(Si(CH3)3)(Ar3)) was used. The bond angles of N-Ge-Ge are 100.09(6)¬∞, which are much more distorted than Ar1GeGeAr1 and Ar2GeGeAr2. The synthesis of LGeGeL.  Reduction of digermylene  Sterically crowded trans-dibromodigermylene, which is protected by 2,6-bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl]-4-[tris(trimethylsilyl)methyl]phenyl (Bbt) groups, can be reduced by two equivalent of potassium graphite (KC8) in benzene at room temperature to give the birth to corresponding digermyne BbtGe‚â°GeBbt. The synthesis of BbtGeGeBbt.  Bonding   Valence bond models  The most obvious difference between alkynes and digermynes, and also other heavier alkyne analogues, is the molecular geometry, which is linear in alkynes, but trans-bent in all heavier alkyne analogues. This huge difference in molecular geometry is resulted from the difference between carbon-carbon triple bond and the bonding of two group 14 heavier atoms, for example germanium atoms. Heavier group 14 elements have much larger covalent radii than carbon. For example, the single and triple bond radii of carbon are 75 √Ö and 60 √Ö respectively, while the single and triple bond radii of germanium are 121 √Ö and 114 √Ö respectively, which are approximately 50% longer. The triple-bond system REER of group 14 elements can be viewed as the interaction between either two quartet ER fragments or two doublet ER fragments. The former case corresponds to the planar structure, while the latter one represents the trans-bent structure. The quartet ER fragments are lower in energy than doublet one only when E is carbon, which is to say for heavier group 14 elements, the trans-bent structure is more energetically favored than planar structure. For example, HGe and PhGe fragments of HGeGeH and PhGeGePh are 44.2 and 44.1 kcal/mol more stable in energy than the quartet states respectively, under the calculation level of B3PW91/6-311+G(2df) (for Ge), 6-31G(d) (for C, H). The criterion of a trans-bent structure can be given by CGMT model. Therefore, the bonding between two Ge atoms in digermynes can be described as donor-acceptor interactions using valence bond models. The quartet and doublet structure of RGe fragments It can be seen from the bonding representations that Ge atoms are either linked by one œÉ-bond and two donor- acceptor bonds (from a filled sp hybrid orbital to an empty p orbital) or one œÉ-bond and one œÄ-bond with a resonating lone pair or two radicals on each Ge atoms. According to the resonance structures, one of the two Ge atoms bears partial positive charge and is electron deficient, the other Ge atom has an electron lone pair and is able to donate some electron density. Donor-acceptor bonds and resonance structures of digermynes The abnormal bond angles and the single-bond feature of LGeGeL can be rationalized by the electron donating character of N atom, which leads to the formation of N p(œÄ)‚ÜíGe (empty p orbital) interaction. Therefore, the donor-acceptor bonds between two Ge atoms are weakened and are more like non-bonding electron lone pairs. It has been suggested that the bond order of Ge-Ge bond is to some degree affected by the electronic properties of bulky protecting groups.  Molecular orbital (MO) treatment  Second order Jahn-Teller effect of the bonding between two Ge atoms in digermynes leads to the geometrical distortion of digermynes. In a molecular orbital (MO) description, the geometrical distortion (trans-bent structure) of digermynes is the consequence of the second order Jahn-Teller (SOJT) effect, which is the symmetry allowed interaction between filled bonding MO (generally the HOMO in digermynes) and empty nonbonding or antibonding MOs (usually the latter one) that are close in energy and can lead to large molecular distortion. If constraining the digermyne molecule in D‚àûh point group, two Ge atoms will form one low-lying œÉ-bonding orbital, two degenerate œÄ-bonding orbitals and œÄ-antibonding orbitals, and one high-lying œÉ-antibonding orbital, which are the same as alkynes. SOJT mixing of in-plain œÄ-bonding orbital (œÄx, HOMO) and œÉ-antibonding orbital, which have the same bu symmetry in the trans-bent C2h point group, give rise to a slipped œÄ-bond with significant non-bonded electron lone pair character which is lower in energy, as well as a œÉ-antibonding orbital with higher energy. This second order mixing of MOs leads to the molecular distortion in geometry from linear D‚àûh to trans-bent C2h. The mixing of œÉ-bonding orbital and in-plain œÄ-antibonding orbital (œÄx*, LUMO) is also symmetrically (both are in bg symmetry) and energetically allowed. Noticing that large SOJT effect occurs between two orbitals with energy difference of 2 eV or even larger, for example, 4 eV, the extent of mixing of orbitals is neglectable in alkynes, but is maximized in heavier elements, like Ge atoms in digermynes.  Reactivity   Cycloaddition  Because of the multibonded feature of digermynes and the large interatomic repulsion of two Ge atoms, digermynes can undergo cycloaddition reactions with alkenes and alkynes, such as ethylene and acetylene. = [2+1] and [2+2] Cycloaddition = Digermynes are able to react with a variety of unsaturated small molecules, including alkynes, alkenes, PhN=NPh, isocyanides, and azides, due to their relatively weak Ge-Ge bonds. It has been proven that there are two types of reaction modes when BbtGeGeBbt is treated with ethylene, which both undergo a [1+2] cycloaddition reaction at first to afford a germirane-substituted germylene intermediate. Ge atom of the germirane substituent then easily inserts into one of the Ge-C bonds of germylene to generate 1,2-digermacyclobutene, which has been illustrated both experimentally and computationally. In the case that the pressure of ethylene is about 1 atm, the 1,2-digermacyclobutene further reacts with one equivalent of ethylene through the same cycloaddition reaction to afford a digermane with two four-membered Ge2C2 rings, while the digermane with two three-membered GeC2 rings is obtained with higher pressure of ethylene. It has been suggested that the former one is thermodynamically stable product, whereas the latter one is only kinetically stable. The reaction between BbtGeGeBbt and ethylene. Similarly, [2+2] cycloaddition reactions take place between digermynes and alkynes, for example PhC‚â°CPh, leading to the formation of 1,2-digermacyclobutadiene. = [4+1] Cycloaddition: diradical character of digermynes = [4+1] cycloaddition reaction of Ar2GeGeAr2 with 1,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene. Different from alkynes which undergo [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene to give 1,4-cyclohexadiene derivatives, digermynes undergo [4+1] cycloaddition reaction because of the presence of the exceedingly reactive diradical character, which can be seen in valence orbital models. In the case of Ar2GeGeAr2, it reacts with 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene to afford unusual germane derivative. The reaction begins between each of the radical center and 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene first, which give rise to the formation of digermane with two germacyclopent-3-ene rings through [4+1] cycloaddition. The increased steric repulsion of two GeC4 rings leads to the homolytic cleavage of the Ge-Ge single bond which then produces the final germane by 1,4-addition reaction with additional equivalent of the 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene. The breaking of the Ge-Ge bond is not seen when BbtGeGeBbt reacts with 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, which only gives rise to digermane.  Addition reaction of alcohols and water: multiple-bond character of digermynes  BbtGeGeBbt has been proven to be able to undergo addition reaction with alcohols such as methanol and water to generate 1,1-dimethoxydigermane and 1,1-dihydroxydigermane, respectively, which demonstrate the multiple-bond character of digermynes. Addition reactions of BbtGeGeBbt with methanol and water  Coordination reaction  The quarlitative molecular orbital diagram of the interaction between Ar1GeGeAr1 and Ag+. Noticing that the au(œÄ) bonding orbital in digermynes has the ability to act as the œÄ-electron donor, Ar1GeGeAr1 can react with AgSbF6 to form [AgAr1GeGeAr1]+SbF6‚àí at -40 ¬∞C. [AgAr1GeGeAr1]+ has a C2 axis through the silver atom which is perpandicular to the CGeGeC plain and the midpoint of the Ge-Ge bond. The silver atom is coordinated by two Ge atoms and two arenes from Dipp groups of the bulky protecting groups. The bond between GeGe moiety and Ag+ is dominated by the interaction between the HOMO of Ar1GeGeAr1 and 5s and 5p orbitals of Ag+, which claims the œÉ-character of the interaction, while the œÄ-character can be explained by the relative weak interaction of Ag 4dxz orbital with œÄ* orbital (LUMO+1). Therefore, it has been suggested that [AgAr1GeGeAr1]+ is a hybrid of œÄ-complex and a metallacyclopropene-like œÉ-complex.

The Swiss press generally commented positively on Cassis's election. Cassis took office on 1 November 2017 as head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, succeeding Didier Burkhalter. He caused some controversy shortly after his election when the media reported that he addressed and joined ProTell, a gun-rights advocacy group, nine days before his election, something that might have made his relationship with the EU difficult as foreign minister due to discussions over joint gun policy. Cassis ended his membership in ProTell and other gun-rights organizations shortly afterward.  Personal life  Cassis was born to Mariarosa and Gino at the Malcantonese Hospital of Castelrotto, Ticino.

Benzophenone imine is widely used as a reagent for the protection of primary amines, and the starting materials to synthesize aniline.  Synthesis  Benzophenone imine is available via the addition of MeOH to the complex of a nitrile and a Grignard reagent or the reaction between benzophenone and ammonia.  Synthesis by Grignard-nitrile complexes  Synthesis of benzophenone imine assisted by grignard reagent The first report about the preparation of ketimines involved Grignard-nitrile complexes followed by careful hydrolysis, which is known as Moureu-Mignonac ketimine synthesis. Then Pickard and Tolbert improved the preparation by using methanol in the addition of Grignard-nitrile complexes.  Synthesis by benzophenone and ammonia  In 1988, A. G. Guimanini discovered a new route to synthesize benzophenone imine by a reaction using benzophenone and ammonia. A chemical pure-grade ammonia gas is added to a benzophenone solution, forming Ph2C=NH2+. After sodium hydroxide pellets are added to the solution, the Ph2C=NH2+ is neutralized, generating the expected benzophenone imine.  Applications   Protecting group for primary amines  Primary amines can be protected benzophenone imine, and the protected amines are stable in flash chromatography.  Amination of aryl halides  Buchwald-Hartwig amination is a very important kind of reaction for coupling aromatic halide and amine to form carbon-nitrogen bonds with the help of palladium-involved catalysts. In order to obtain anilines, ammonia is required in this reaction. However, ammonia can bind to palladium tightly, which makes the normal Buchwald-Hartwig reaction unavailable. In 1997, Buchwald et. al found that benzophenone imine can be used as an ammonia-equivalent and solve the above limitations.

It has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since 1988. The Albert Clock in about 1905 Located in The Square in Barnstaple, the tower was built in 1862 at the suggestion of the then Mayor of Barnstaple, John Norrington, following the death of Prince Albert in the previous year. The tower was paid for by public subscription with some of the money being raised for the provision of a drinking fountain. The original design was for a tower without a clock.The Albert Clock on the Barnstaple History website At its solemn dedication ceremony in 1862 surrounded by local dignitaries the clock's pendulum was set to swing at 11.00 p.m., the hour Prince Albert had died. At the same time the water started to flow from the fountain. As Mayor Norrington, a teetotaller, stepped forward to take the first drink from the fountain a man threw a cupful of what was found to be gin into the water. Norrington was outraged at this indignity to himself, to the Queen and to the memory of Prince Albert. An investigation revealed that the mystery man was John Baker, the landlord of the Mermaid Inn and a local Tory councillor. Designed by local architect Richard Davie Gould (c1816-1900), the tower is constructed with limestone ashlar with dressings of Devon marble and sandstone together with other local stones and patterned tiles. The tower has an octagonal shaft on a broader octagonal base surmounted with a square and corbelled clock chamber with a clock-dial in each face. The summit consists of a small belfry with a leaded spire and weather-vane. The bell is still inside. The tower's base has a stair doorway on the South side, while on the North side is a water-trough. At the back of the recess is a panel of coloured tiles with a coat of arms in white marble above it. The drinking fountain, given by Sir William Fraser, MP, has been removed.Denise Holton and Elizabeth Hammett, Secret Barnstaple, Amberley Publishing (2015) - Google Books On the East and West sides are pointed arches of moulded red sandstone with above an arch of different coloured local stones.

It is an example of a main-group cyclopentadienyl complex; these molecules are related to metallocenes but contain p-block elements as the central atom. It is a colorless, air sensitive solid that sublimes under vacuum.  Synthesis  The first synthesis of decamethylsilicocene was reported by Jutzi and coworkers. It involved reduction of bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)silicon(IV) dichloride with two equivalents of sodium naphthalenide to generate decamethylsilicocene, naphthalene, and sodium chloride. Generation of the sterically crowded bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)silicon(IV) dichloride required several steps, beginning with double deprotonation of (C5Me4H)2SiCl2 using tert-butyllithium, followed by treatment of the resultant (C5Me4Li)2SiCl2 with methyl iodide. Decamethylsilicocene is soluble in aprotic solvents such as hexane, benzene, and chlorinated solvents. Molecular weight determinations show that decamethylsilicocene exists as a monomer in benzene. The 1H NMR spectrum shows one sharp signal and the 13C-{1H} shows two signals one for the ring carbons and one for the methyl group carbons, consistent with the proposed averaged five-fold symmetric structure in solution and Œ∑5 coordination of the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl groups. Original synthesis of decamethylsilicocene from Cp*2SiCl2 and sodium naphthalenide A recent synthesis directly forms decamethylsilicocene through salt metathesis from an N-heterocyclic carbene- stabilized silylene. This synthetic route avoids the synthesis of the bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)silicon(IV) dichloride starting material. In this synthesis, the NHC-stabilized silylene -2,6- was treated with the potassium salt of decamethylcyclopentadiene at , followed by extraction of decamethylsilicocene into hexane at to remove the NHC and KCl byproducts. Synthetic route to decamethylsilicocene beginning from an NHC-stabilized silylene  Structure and bonding  The x-ray crystallographically determined structure of decamethylsilicocene contains two isomers in a 2:1 ratio. The major isomer adopts a Cs geometry reminiscent of a bent metallocene, with the cyclopentadienyl planes forming an angle of about 25¬∞ and the methyl groups staggered. In this isomer, the lone pair on silicon is described as stereochemically active and the distance from the silicon atom to each Cp* centroid is 2.12 √Ö. The minor isomer adopts a D5d geometry, the same as decamethylferrocene, with the cyclopentadienyl rings parallel to one another and the methyl groups staggered. The distance from the silicon atom to each Cp* centroid is 2.11 √Ö. The presence of two isomers is thought to be due to packing effects. Computational studies carried out on the parent silicocene, (C5H5)2Si, reveal a very small (~4 kJ/mol) energetic change upon distorting the molecule from the D5d geometry to either a C2v (bent, hydrogen atoms eclipsed) or Cs (bent, hydrogen atoms staggered) geometry. A qualitative molecular orbital diagram predicts that the HOMO would have silicon(3s)-cyclopentadienyl antibonding character and the LUMO would have silicon(3p)-cyclopentadienyl antibonding character. NBO calculations are consistent with the predictions from a qualitative molecular orbital diagram, showing antibonding character between the silicon and the cyclopentadienyl ligands in both the HOMO and the LUMO. Calculated NBO valence orbital occupation numbers suggest that significant bonding occurs between the cyclopentadienyl ligands and the silicon 3s, 3px and 3py orbitals. In comparison, the carbocene congener, silicon is calculated to bond more strongly to the cyclopentadienyl ligands due to the greater radial extension of the 3p orbitals compared to 2p orbitals. Additionally, the energetic separation between the 3s and 3p orbitals is greater than for the 2s and 2p orbitals, leading to less sp mizing which decreases the favorability of distortion to a silylene geometry in which each cyclopentadienyl ligand is bound Œ∑1 to the silicon atom. Atoms in molecules (AIM) calculations are consistent with this view. A plot of the Laplacian of the electron density between the central silicon atom and one cyclopentadienyl carbon shows less localization of the charge towards the central atom as compared to equivalent calculations for carbocene.  Reactivity  Decamethylsilicocene reacts with aldehydes and ketones to give products with a silicon (IV) central atom and a carbon-carbon bond formed between two equivalents of the aldehyde or ketone. The two resultant alkoxides are coordinated to the silicon atom to form a five-membered ring. The coordination of the cyclopentadienyl ring changes from Œ∑5 to Œ∑1 over the course of these reactions Similar changes in the hapticity of the pentamethylcyclopentadientyl rings occur when decamethylsilicocene reacts with carbon-nitrogen triples bonds. With organic cyanates and thiocyanates, carbon-carbon bond formation occurs and the resultant organic fragment is coordinated to the silicon atom through two anionic nitrogens. Decamethylsilicocene reacts with inorganic cyanides such as BrCN and through oxidative addition to form a silicon (IV) product with a cyanide ligand along with either a Br or Me3Si ligand. Decamethylsilicocene can be protonated using strong acids such as . Upon protonation, one equivalent of pentamethylcyclopentadiene is eliminated to produce the pentamethylsilicon(II) cation with a . The pentamethylcyclopentadienylsilicon(II) cation reacts with a variety of cyclopentadienyl salts to produce substituted silicocenes. Silicocene derivatives synthesized this way include (Me5C5)((i-Pr)5C5)Si, ((Me5C5)(1,3,4-Me3H2C5)Si and (Me5C5)(H5C5)Si. The latter compound is stable at but begins to decompose at . Additionally, the pentamethylcyclopentadienylsilicon(II) cation can react with metal precursors to generate complexes with metal-silicon multiple bonds.

They are also typically stabilized by an electron donor-acceptor interaction between the germanium atom and a large, bulky ligand.  Synthesis  The first stable monomeric germylene hydride was reported by Roesky et al. in 2001. Initial attempts to synthesize the compound involved treating a Œ≤-diketiminato germylene chloride precursor, [{HC-(CMeNAr)2}GeCl] (where Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H), with LiAlH4, though this proved unsuccessful, with the formation of an aluminum dihydride species instead. However, use of the weaker reducing agent NaBH4 resulted in the formation of a germylene hydride with a borane adduct. They found that the Ge-H bond was inert in this adduct, and so the borane adduct was able to be selectively removed at room temperature by a PMe3 scavenger, resulting in the desired terminal germylene hydride: 379x379px When the Œ≤-diketiminato germylene chloride was treated with the alane-amine adduct AlH3‚Ä¢NMe3 in toluene at -4 ¬∞C, the solution underwent a color change from yellow to orange-red as the volatile trimethylamine was removed from the solution, and the resulting power was identified as the stable terminal germylene hydride with 60% yield, thus affording the first direct synthetic route: Direct synthesis of a stable, monomeric terminal germylene hydride The synthesis and isolation of two digermanium germanium(II) hydrides have also been reported. One of these compounds was formed by the addition of L-selectride to a bulky germanium(II) chloride in ether, while the other was formed by the addition of L-selectride to the same germanium(II) chloride in toluene, followed by filtration and the dropwise addition of PMe3. 370x370px The first stable acyclic germylene hydride was formed from the dissociation of a hydrido-digermene. The initial monomeric germylene chloride was synthesized by the reaction of a bulky lithium amide ligand and GeCl2‚Ä¢dioxane. Although synthesized from multiple synthetic pathways, reaction of the germylene chloride with L-selectride in toluene at -80 ¬∞C most directly gives the orange crystalline hydrido-digermene with 52% yield. This digermene is thought to be in equilibrium with a two-coordinate hydrido-germylene, which can be isolated upon addition of DMAP (dimethylaminopyridine) at 20 ¬∞C, giving pale yellow crystals of the three-coordinate germylene hydride in 27% yield. Synthesis of first stable acyclic germylene hydride Similar to the germylene hydrides, the first known example of a germyliumylidene hydride (a germylene hydride cation) was isolated in 2014. This compound can be formed from a two step process, starting with the reaction of potassium bis(NHC)-borate with GeCl2‚Ä¢dioxane to yield a zwitterionic germyliumylidene chloride. The Cl/H exchange can then be undergone via reaction with K[HB(s-Bu)3] to give the germylene hydride cation in 91% yield. Synthesis of first stable monomeric germanium(II) hydride cation (a germyliumylidene hydride) The germylene hydride cation was also further reacted with the trityl cation, [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]‚àí, as a hydride scavenger, which resulted in the formation of an adduct with the three-coordinate germylene hydride cation acting a donor and a two-coordinate Ge(II) dication as an electron acceptor.  Structure and Bonding  The Œ≤-diketiminato germylene hydride reported Roesky et al. crystallizes in the P21/n space group as two isostructural molecules per unit. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the orange-red crystals showed that the germanium atom is tetrahedrally coordinated by the hydrogen atom, the Œ≤-diketiminato ligand, and the germanium lone pair. The Ge-N bond length is reported to be 1.989 √Ö and the Ge-H bond displays an absorption at 1733 cm‚àí1, corresponding to a stretching mode.

The first of these reactivites were reported by Jana et al. in 2009, but have been significantly expounded upon since then. The bulk of reported reactivities are for the Œ≤-diketiminato germylene hydride. For many of these reactions, including reactions with alkynes and carbon dioxide, germanium is found to retain its oxidation state during the transfer of hydrogen. = CO2 reduction = Proposed mechanism for conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol with a germylene hydride catalyst. The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide by the Œ≤-diketiminato germylene hydride proceeds at room temperature without a catalyst to form the germylene ester of formic acid in quantitative yield. This germylene ester is reported to further react at -78 ¬∞C with the nucleophile lithium amidoborane (LiH2NBH3), which can be formed by treatment of the commercially available ammonia borane with n-BuLi, to generate lithium formate in high yield (85%-95%). Lithium formate can be converted to formic acid with an acid workup and the original germylene hydride was found to reform in the generation of lithium formate, thus making a germylene hydride a potential catalyst for conversion of carbon dioxide to formic acid. Furthermore, it was found that the same germylene hydride reacts with 3 equivalents of ammonia borane at 60 ¬∞C in THF, producing methanol (after an aqueous workup) and again reforming the germylene hydride. The stability of the germylene hydride to water also allows it to be recovered from the other reaction products via an extraction in benzene, an important property for any catalyst to be used to generate chemical feedstocks. In 2014 Tan et al. showed that the Œ≤-diketiminato germylene formate and a closely related germylene formate compound can both produce methanol in high yield with alane used as a hydride source, providing yet another route for germylene hydrides to be used as catalysts for carbon dioxide transformations. = Alkynes = The Œ≤-diketiminato germylene hydride is reported to react with several alkynes, including ethyl propiolate to form a vinyl germylene in good yield (>80%). This reaction occurs via the 1,2-addition of the germylene hydride across the alkyne triple bond, as opposed to an H2 elimination involving one of the C-H bonds of the alkyne. This reaction also requires no catalyst, in contrast to previously reported reactions of Ge(IV)-H and alkynes that have necessitated a variety of catalysts. = Ketones = Activated ketones, such as 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone, react with the Œ≤-diketiminato germylene hydride to form the corresponding germylene alkoxide in quantitative yield. This reaction proceeds through a nucleophilic hydride addition to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. However, this reaction is unsuccessful with less electrophilic ketones, such as acetone and benzophenone. = Elemental sulfur = Two equivalents of elemental sulfur react with the Œ≤-diketiminato germylene hydride to give a germanium dithiocarboxylic acid analogue in moderate yield (60%). In formation of the product, the oxidation state of germanium changes from Ge(II) to Ge(IV), thus requiring both the insertion and oxidative addition of elemental sulfur into the Ge(II)-H bond. No intermediates have been isolated and the mechanistic order of these steps is currently unknown. There was also no evidence found for any tautomeric equilibrium of the germanium dithiocarboxylic acid analogue, which is reflected in the two varying Ge-S bond lengths (2.064 √Ö and 2.242 √Ö).  Hydroboration  359x359pxthumb Proposed catalytic cycle for hydroboration of carbonyl compounds, (R1)(R2)CO (R1/R2 = Alkyl, Aryl, or H), catalyzed by amido germylene hydride. The previously reported acyclic amido germylene hydride was found to catalyze the hydroboration of a variety of aldehydes and ketones with the mild borane reagent HBpin (pin = pinacolato). The catalytic efficiency of aldehyde conversions was markedly greater for aliphatic aldehydes, with turnover frequencies (TOFs) ranging from 2000-6000 h‚àí1, than for aromatic aldehydes, whose TOFs never exceeded 67. This efficiency discrepancy can be explained by the increased steric bulk of aromatic aldehydes that make it more difficult for the oxygen nucleophile to approach the Ge metal in the rate-determining step, as well as by the decreased Lewis basicity of the oxygen the aryl substituents impart. The ketones were found to require a significantly higher catalyst loading than the aldehydes and, furthermore, reacted at a much slower rate than the aldehydes. Notably, however, the majority of reported catalytic efficiencies for both the aldehydes and ketones were greater for the germylene hydride than for previously reported transition metal catalyzed hydroborations using HBpin.  Other reactions  = Nitrous oxide = Reaction of the Œ≤-diketiminato germylene hydride with nitrous oxide produces a germylene hydroxide, the first reported Group 14 metal hydride to react with N2O in such a way. Nitrous oxide serves as an oxygen source to form this compound in almost quantitative yield. = Trimethylsilyl azide = Trimethylsilylazide (Me3SiN3) forms two products in a 1:1 ratio upon reaction with the Œ≤-diketiminato germylene hydride: a germanium(II) azide and a germanium(IV) diamide. The germanium(II) azide is thought to form from the metathesis of the germylene hydride and trimethylazide, with concomitant elimination of Me3SiH. The mechanism for germanium(IV) diamide is less clear, though it is proposed that the pathway involves an oxidative addition-insertion of a nitrene (:NSiMe3), formed in situ via dinitrogen elimination from the azide, along with intramolecular hydride shifts. = Azo and diazo compounds = The Œ≤-diketiminato germylene hydride has been reported to react with both ethyl diazoacetate and trimethylsilyldiazomethane, forming germanium(II)-substituted hydrazone derivatives. The reaction progresses by the end-on insertion of the diazoalkane into the Ge(II)-H bond, with subsequent hydrogen transfer to the nitrogen. Electronic structure analysis shows that the stability of the product stems from a shifting of electron density from the N-N bond onto the Ge-N bond. The analysis also shows that diazoalkane insertion destabilizes the ring structure and that the R-group likely plays little role in the stability of the compound. The oxidative addition of the Œ≤-diketiminato germylene hydride with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) is also reported to proceed at room temperature in high yield.

The ritual, historically dating back to pre-Safavids (almost 450 years ago), is carried out at various places in Iran. People carrying the Nakhl on their shoulders are guided by the people standing on the Nakhl. The ritual is so common in Iran that in most parts of the country, either people have the Nakhl in their community or at least they know about it.

This ribbon worm has a wide geographical range on both sides of the northern Atlantic Ocean. Description Cerebratulus lacteus grows to a length of about and a width of . The head is rounded and flattened, with a pair of cerebral organs and cephalic grooves, but no eyes. The head is not readily distinguishable from the body, which is flattened and gradually tapers towards the tail, where there is a slender caudal cirrus. This worm is usually milky-white in colour but may be pink. Ecology Cerebratulus lacteus burrows in muddy sediments into which it can burrow rapidly. It is a voracious predator and has been observed attacking bivalve molluscs and crustaceans. The proboscis is everted (turned inside out) and the lower half of the Atlantic jackknife clam (Ensis directus) is enveloped. In an effort to escape, the clam works its way out of the sediment and may then be at risk of predation by birds. Soft clams, such as Mya arenaria are also attacked. In this case, the ribbonworm inserts the tip of its proboscis through the siphon and consumes the soft tissues. It is not clear whether the ribbonworm preys on hard clams, but a high abundance of this worm at one location near Prince Edward Island was thought to be responsible for the high mortality among newly transplanted hard clams. As is the case with other nemertean worms, the sexes are separate in this species and fertilisation is external. Reproduction can also occur by fragmentation, as this worm readily breaks into pieces which can grow into new organisms. Research Cerebratulus lacteus produces several homologous polypeptide cytotoxins that are active in breaking down the membranes of human red blood cells, as well as several neurotoxins. These substances are being researched. Clams have been identified as a useful subject for aquaculture in Canada. Because Cerebratulus lacteus is a threat to such activities, research is ongoing into the ribbonworm and what governs its patchy distribution, with a view to being able to better control it.

Both purport to come from a prosecution of Aristogeiton initiated by Lycurgus on the grounds that Aristogeiton had initiated prosecutions and made speeches in the assembly when he was disenfranchised. Since the 19th century, the authenticity of both speeches has been doubted. Background Not much is known about Aristogeiton other that what is found in the speeches against him. He was a prominent politician in Athens who had already been involved in a number of legal entanglements before the case from which Demosthenes' speeches were given. The case against Aristogeiton in this suit was that he was a public debtor, and therefore disenfranchised. Aristogeiton had been fined five talents for a charge of graphe paranomon (proposing an illegal decree), and 1,000 drachmas for failing to win one fifth of the jurors votes in a prosecution he himself had brought. Both of these debts had been doubled, as Aristogeiton had failed to pay them off promptly. Later, these debts had been taken on by his brother, Eunomos, and so Aristogeiton had resumed public life, arguing that he was no longer a debtor to the treasury. His prosecutors argued that, as Eunomos had not finished paying off the debt, Aristogeiton should still be disenfranchised. Aristogeiton also owed a third fine to the treasury, which he had challenged. At the time of the trial, the challenge had not yet been considered; the prosecutors therefore argued that Aristogeiton should still be considered as owing it, and therefore disenfranchised. The prosecution of Aristogeiton was brought by Lycurgus. The second speech refers to the Battle of Chaeronea,Demosthenes 26.11 which puts the terminus post quem of the speech at 338 BC; as the trial pre-dates Deinarchos' prosecution of Aristogeiton, it could have been no later than 324 BC. Content The first speech against Aristogeiton assumes that the substance of the charges against Aristogeiton have already been proven by the preceding prosecution speakers. Instead of attempting to demonstrate Aristogeiton's guilt, it focuses on attacking him more broadly for his poneria (wickedness). The speaker relates a series of shocking anecdotes about Aristogeiton's conduct, which though not strictly relevant to the charges against him show Aristogeiton in a poor light. Following this, Demosthenes moves on to a more substantial point of law, which he says was not discussed by Lycurgus: he argues that a debt does not cease upon being challenged, but only when that challenge is upheld. The final section of the first speech consists of an examination of pleas which could be made in mitigation, along with an analysis of why they do not apply to Aristogeiton's case. The second speech is much shorter than the first. Much of the speech discusses the importance of punishing lawbreakers in general ‚Äì and Aristogeiton, as a prominent politician, in particular. The speech draws parallels with past politicians who were punished for breaking the law. Authorship The authorship of both of the speeches against Aristogeiton has long been questioned by scholars. As both are preserved as supporting speeches by Demosthenes at the same trial, and Demosthenes can only have made one such speech, at least one of them must be inauthentic. The first speech was generally accepted as authentic by ancient authorities ‚Äì Dionysius of Halicarnassus is the only ancient author to dispute that Demosthenes wrote it. Other ancient authors, including Pliny the Younger and the author of On the Sublime, accept it as Demosthenic. Since the 19th century, however, the authorship has been questioned, primarily on the basis that it makes mistakes about Athenian law which Demosthenes would not have. Additionally, Raphael Sealey challenges the speech on the grounds that it contradicts other sources on Aristogeiton at a number of points. Sealey therefore concludes that the speech was a later rhetorical exercise. Friedrich Blass attributed the speech to Demosthenes, but considered it \\"repetitive, confused and disorderly\\" and therefore suggested that it was drafted, but never delivered, by him. More recently, Douglas MacDowell has argued that Against Aristogeiton I is correctly attributed to Demosthenes. The second speech is generally considered not have been written by Demosthenes. Both Sealey and MacDowell consider it to have been written at the time of the trial, but by a different author. Sealey argues on stylistic grounds that it cannot have been written by Demosthenes ‚Äì the high number of tribrachs (three consecutive short syllables) was generally avoided by Demosthenes. MacDowell argues that it \\"lacks the strength of expression\\" that the first speech has, and is therefore less likely to have been authored by Demosthenes.

She did not repeat herself so that, as one critic said, \\"everything feels discovered.\\" Soon after her marriage in 1918, Crockett traveled to France with her sculptor husband Edmond Quattrocchi. There, she studied at Acad√©mie Moderne in Paris and in 1929 was appointed its director. In 1937, newly divorced, she returned from Paris. Three years later she rented an apartment on 14th Street at 8th Avenue in New York where she lived and painted the rest of her life. Throughout her career she supported herself by taking a variety of jobs, including work for the Federal Art Project and in war industries. In her free time both during her working years and after retirement, she produced a body of work which was recognized for its excellence after her death. Early life and training Crockett was born and raised on a family farm in northwest Ohio. Intending to become an art teacher, she studied art and mathematics at Oberlin College and, after graduating in 1911, studied art education at the Thomas Training School in Detroit, Michigan. In 1915 she was appointed art supervisor in the Roslyn, New York, public school system. While living in that community she met the Italian-born sculptor, Edmondo Quattrocchi. She and he continued to live there after marrying in 1918, and, in 1924, after he was hired to work on a memorial to the Second Battle of the Marne, they traveled to France. There, Crockett studied at the Sorbonne and the school of the Louvre, while also serving as head of a school for war orphans at Poissy, west of Paris. Career A few years later she attended and then became director of a Parisian art school that had been established by Fernand L√©ger. Called Acad√©mie Moderne, the school attracted students from as far away as Japan, South America, and the United States and had as instructors Am√©d√©e Ozenfant and Aleksandra Ekster as well as L√©ger. Crockett left the school in the early 1930s during a turbulent period when, no longer able to tolerate Quattrocchi's drinking and womanizing, she initiated divorce proceedings against him. In 1937, the year the divorce was finally granted in French court, she was given a solo exhibition at Galerie La Fen√™tre Ouverte. She was also awarded a bronze medal for a painting she showed at the International Exposition in Paris that year. At the end of 1937 Crockett returned to the United States. She lived in New York, where, mixing with the city's artists and art dealers, she met Blanche Bonestell. , the owner a gallery on 57th Street, who took some paintings of hers on consignment. In 1938 she taught free art classes at the state normal school in Potsdam, New York as an employee of the Federal Art Project and the following year was given a solo show in Potsdam town library. In 1940 she returned to Manhattan where she rented an apartment at the corner of 14th Street and 8th Avenue where she lived and painted for the rest of her life. With the entry of the United States in World War II, Crockett supported herself by working a succession of jobs in New York's war industries. Obtaining little income from her painting, she continued to work in engineering and design positions for New York employers until, at age 74, she was able to retire and devote her remaining years to producing art. In 1946 Crockett was given a solo exhibition at the Bonestell Gallery and during the 1940s and 1950s her work appeared in group shows at both Bonestell and the Provincetown Art Association in Cape Cod. In 1942, as a member of the Bombshell Artists' Group, she showed three paintings in an exhibition held by the group at the Riverside Museum. In 1965, after she retired from the last of the jobs she had used to support herself, she contributed work to a show held at the Overseas Press Club in New York. From that time to 1973 she produced paintings that have been considered to be some of her finest work. Crockett died in 1979. In 2015 and again in 2017 she was given retrospective exhibitions by the Meredith Ward Fine Art gallery in Manhattan's Upper East Side. Artistic style Flora Crockett, Untitled, 1941, oil on canvas board, 30 x 22 inches Early in her career, Crockett produced work that was somber and, while abstract, not entirely non-objective. An untitled painting of 1941 shows geometric objects in red, gray, and black colors along with what are clearly two smoke stacks, one emitting smoke or steam. This work reminded a critic of paintings by the American surrealist, Kay Sage. Flora Crockett, untitled, undated (between 1940 and 1960), oil on canvas board, 24 x 20 inches Crockett's later work was almost entirely non- objective, containing geometric and biomorphic forms in bright colors. Critics considered this work to be characterized by a spirit of independence and tough-mindedness, uniquely her own. An untitled and undated work, showing a ring-like object at an angle to the ground, is typical. The viewer sees both the inside and the outside of the red ring, a stream of color passes through the ring, and near the top of the ring there is a leaf-shaped object in yellow. In another representative work, \\"66,\\" painted in 1966, there a band of yellow-orange slinking among red objects, along with blocks of blue and pink and a vertical red on the right edge. One of her last paintings, \\"1972-3\\" of 1972, shows the dynamism of her late style. Personal life and family Crockett was born on April 27, 1892, in Grelton, Ohio. Her father was Malcolm Crockett (1852-1931) who owned and farmed 160 acres in Grelton, Ohio. Relations of the family to which Davy Crockett belonged, the Crocketts were among the first settlers in northwest Ohio. Malcolm was a prominent member of the local community, working to improve its school and to achieve local infrastructure improvements. He organized, supervised, and taught in the Sunday school of the Methodist church to which he belonged. In 1881 he married Mary E. Wheaton (1855-1918) in Barre, Vermont. She had graduated from the Barre Academy in 1873 and subsequently attended Oberlin College. After leaving Oberlin, and until she married, she taught school in Vermont, Minnesota, and Ohio. Crockett had four siblings, Edith Harriet (1885-1979), Annie May (1887-1932), George McDonald (1889-1951), and Pliny Wheaton (1895-1978). Raised on her family's farm, Crockett attended local schools and then Oberlin College, where she majored in art and mathematics, graduating in 1911. During the next three years she studied art at the Thomas Training School in Detroit, Michigan, and in 1915 became supervisor of art instruction in the public schools of Roslyn, Long Island, New York. While living in Roslyn, she met and in 1918 married the Italian-born sculptor, Edmondo Quattrocchi. The two moved to Paris in 1924, Edmondo to work on a World War I statue, and Crockett to serve as director of a school for war orphans in Poissy called L'√âcole de Champfleury. A few years later she began to study at the Acad√©mie Moderne in Paris and a bit later became its director. In 1933, complaining of his drinking and womanizing, Crockett sued Quattrocchi for divorce, and four years later was granted her freedom. She returned to New York in 1937 taking an apartment at 233 West 14th Street where she lived most of the rest of her life. Until she retired in the mid-1960s, Crockett supported herself in a variety of occupations, including design, sales, engineering, teaching, and art administration. In the late 1930s she worked for the Federal Arts Project of the Works Projects Administration and during World War II and for some time thereafter she worked as an inspector of artillery parts in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Crockett died in St. Vincent's hospital on July 31, 1979, and was buried in a family gravesite at Grelton Cemetery, Grelton, Ohio. Other names used Crockett's birth name was Flora Eva Crockett.

The corporation also invited governments and economic development organizations to give the corporation tax breaks and other incentives to entice it to their locality. More than 200 cities in Canada, Mexico, and the United States eventually offered tax breaks, expedited construction approvals, promises of infrastructure improvements, new crime- reduction programs, and other incentives. On January 18, 2018, a shortlist of 20 finalists was announced, after which the candidate localities continued to detail or expand their incentive packages. On November 13, 2018, Amazon announced that HQ2 would be split into two locations, with 25,000 workers at each: National Landing, a future neighborhood including Crystal City in Arlington, Virginia, and Long Island City in Queens, New York City. Virginia will provide $573 million in tax breaks, $23 million in cash, and other incentives. New York planned to give Amazon tax breaks of at least $1.525 billion, cash grants of $325 million, and other incentives. Amazon pulled out of the New York location three months later after opposition from some residents and local politicians. Background Part of the Amazon headquarters in Seattle, under construction in 2015 Amazon was founded in 1994 in Bellevue, Washington, and moved to leased space in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle. As the company grew, it went through a series of office moves around Downtown Seattle, until announcing a move to a purpose-built headquarters campus in the South Lake Union neighborhood, then a light industrial enclave undergoing urban renewal. , Amazon occupies of office space in 33 buildings in Seattle, employing 40,000 white collar workers. Requirements Amazon's request for proposals outlined several core requirements, as well as optional preferences. * Metropolitan areas with a population of over 1 million * Within of a population center * Within 45 minutes of an international airport * Proximity to major highways and arterial roads * Access to mass transit routes * Up to of office space for future expansion Optional preferences included airports with direct flights to Seattle, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., urban locations, and proximity to major universities. The deadline for Phase I bids was set at October 19, 2017. A final site was planned to be selected and announced in November 2018, from a shortlist of 20 cities released in January. Bids Submitted , 238 proposals had been submitted and received by Amazon, representing cities and regions from 54 states, provinces, districts, and territories. The only U.S. states that did not have a locality that submitted a formal proposal were Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. The Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Saskatchewan also had no regions submit a bid, along with the Yukon Territory. Little Rock, Arkansas and San Antonio, Texas later withdrew their submission. Moody's Analytics published an analysis of bidding metropolitan areas and determined that Austin, Texas, ranks highest among Amazon's criteria, followed by Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Rochester, New York. The New York Times also completed an analysis which found Denver to be the best site based on Amazon's criteria, followed closely by Boston and Washington, D.C. Irish gambling site Paddy Power originally listed Atlanta as the odds on favorite to win HQ2, with 2-to-1 odds, but as of January 2018, listed Atlanta and Austin as sharing 3-to-1 odds of winning Amazon HQ2. Promotional campaigns Several cities and groups promoted their HQ2 bids by engaging in promotional campaigns and gimmicks, including offers and gifts to Amazon. Sun Corridor, a Tucson, Arizona economic development firm, sent a 21-foot saguaro cactus to Amazon in an attempt to promote the city's bid. The gift was rejected due to the company's corporate gifts policy, instead donating it to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. The city of Stonecrest, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, voted to de-annex of land for Amazon to establish its own city named Amazon around its headquarters. Sly James, mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, purchased 1,000 products from Amazon, which he donated to charity. James wrote 5-star reviews for each one of them, in which every review mentioned positive attributes of Kansas City. Primanti Brothers, a chain of sandwich shops based in Pittsburgh, offered free sandwiches to Amazon employees if they chose the city as their second headquarters. The city of Birmingham, Alabama erected several giant Amazon boxes and dash buttons around public areas. The dash buttons sent out pre-generated tweets to lure Amazon to the city. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio announced that major landmarks in the city would be lit in orange to promote the city's campaign for HQ2. A group from Calgary sprayed messages onto sidewalks in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood urging the company to choose them. During an Ottawa Senators hockey game, fans were encouraged to \\"make noise\\" for the city of Ottawa's Amazon bid. The neighboring American and Canadian cities of Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario submitted a bid together and campaigned the two cities to be the home of the new Amazon campus. With the headquarters being divided across the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, the company could take advantage of tax incentives offered by both Ontario and Michigan. Amazon would also be able to capitalize on the less restrictive Canadian immigration laws and the lower currency exchange of the Canadian Dollar. Contrary to other cities, Little Rock, Arkansas, purchased a full-page ad in The Washington Post \\"breaking up\\" with Amazon, where they described their decision to not submit a bid, while also touting the city's positive attributes. A few days after the bid deadline, the campaign flew a banner plane over Seattle with the same message. Finalists Amazon HQ2 final 20 cities On January 18, 2018, Amazon announced its shortlist of 20 finalists for the HQ2 bidding process. The list focuses mainly on the U.S. East Coast and Midwest, with Los Angeles the only selection from the West Coast and Toronto the only one outside of the United States. * Atlanta, Georgia (including Stonecrest) * Austin, Texas * Boston, Massachusetts (Suffolk Downs-East Boston and Somerville) * Chicago, Illinois (City Center Campus, Downtown Gateway District, River District, Lincoln Yards, The 78, Burnham Lakefront, Fulton Market District, Illinois Medical District, Schaumburg, Oak Brook) * Columbus, Ohio (Franklinton, Ohio State University, Easton) * Dallas, Texas * Denver, Colorado * Indianapolis, Indiana * Los Angeles, California * Miami, Florida * Montgomery County, Maryland * Nashville, Tennessee * Newark, New Jersey * New York City, New York (West Midtown Manhattan, Financial District, Brooklyn Tech Triangle, Long Island City) * Northern Virginia (Fairfax and Loudoun counties, including Arlington and Alexandria, in Virginia) * Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Schuylkill Yards, uCity Square, Navy Yard) * Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania * Raleigh, North Carolina * Toronto, Ontario (including Mississauga, Brampton, York Region, Durham Region, Halton Region, Waterloo Region, Guelph and Hamilton) * Washington, D.C. (Anacostia Riverfront, Capitol Hill East, NoMa- Union Station, Shaw-Howard University) Amazon began tours of its finalist cities in late February. Bidding cities also signed non-disclosure agreements with Amazon for the duration of the bid process. According to an Amazon spokesperson, the NDA does not cover financial incentives that cities have offered. NBC News reported in May that visits to the 20 finalists had been finished by Amazon. In an interview in September 2018, with The Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Bezos said, \\"We will have a decision by the end of the year.\\" In November 2018, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported that several finalists were in advanced talks with Amazon over the HQ2 decision, including the potential choosing of Crystal City in Northern Virginia. Amazon Director of Economic Development Mike Grella wrote on Twitter that the leaker responsible for informing the newspapers was violating a non- disclosure agreement. Grella also criticized media outlets for speculating on the winning bid for HQ2 based on the travel patterns of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns The Post. On November 5, 2018, it was speculated that Amazon was finalizing plans to divide HQ2 evenly among two locations: Crystal City in Arlington, Virginia, Long Island City in Queens, New York, or Dallas, Texas. Amazon declined to comment on The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reports. Some of the finalists and rejected bids have used their Amazon proposals to attract investments from other multinational corporations. Criticism and opposition Steven Strauss, a visiting professor of public policy at Princeton University and an expert on economic development, in an editorial in USA Today suggested that metropolitan areas should be cautious about bidding too generously to win the Amazon bid. He pointed to examples where companies have gone bankrupt or failed to follow up on expansion plans. Strauss also wrote that it was possible that cities could over-pay (the so- called \\"winner's curse\\") by providing an overly generous incentive package, which would turn out to be a money-losing proposition for the municipality if all the promised jobs did not materialize. Conservative and liberal advocacy groups voiced their opposition to various tax breaks promised by cities in hopes of luring Amazon. In early 2018, New York University Stern School of Business professor Scott Galloway predicted that HQ2 would be located in either the New York metropolitan area or the Washington metropolitan area; with the decision to create two locations, Galloway ended up predicting both correctly. He repeatedly called the competition a \\"ruse\\" and a \\"con\\". Galloway said that \\"the game was over before it started\\", claiming that the proximity to both Bezos' home and the capital made the DC area an obvious choice, and that soliciting bids from places that they never intended to move to was solely to gain tax breaks. Former Seattle Mayor Ed Murray announced that he would begin conversations with Amazon about their long-term plans for the city, while the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce characterized the announcement as a \\"wake-up call\\" to Seattle to improve the city's business climate. Comparisons were made to Boeing's decision to move its corporate headquarters from Seattle to Chicago in 2001, which came as a surprise to Seattle. Jim Balsillie remarks that he was disappointed in W. Edmund Clark, the Wynne government czar in charge of the Toronto bid, when in 2017 the latter attempted to sell the buyer on \\"our competitive advantage... software programmers that cost 34% to 38% less than in the US... that's an edge the government is determined not only to maintain but to sharpen.\\" Balsillie found this strategy to be \\"misguided... these strategies put our tech workers in a global race to the bottom, competing on cost with the salaries in Poland, Ukraine, and India.\\" Winning bids The selections of New York City and Northern Virginia for the HQ2 sites were confirmed early on November 13, 2018. Amazon made the official announcement later that day. In Amazon's announcement, a joint press release was presented by the Northern Virginia bidders that Amazon's HQ2 neighborhood location would officially be renamed \\"National Landing\\", which encompasses not only Crystal City but also the nearby areas of Pentagon City and Potomac Yard. Amazon also announced that it would employ 5,000 people at a new Operations Center of Excellence in Nashville, Tennessee.  Long Island City  Long Island City, Queens, New York City, canceled second location of Amazon HQ2 The subsidies offered to Amazon in New York include performance-based direct incentives of $1.525 billion based on whether the company created 25,000 jobs. This included a refundable tax credit through the state's Excelsior Program of up to $1.2 billion, calculated as a percentage of the salaries Amazon expects to pay employees over the following 10 years. Additionally, the Empire State Development Corporation would give Amazon a cash grant of $325 million based on the occupancy rates of HQ2 buildings over in the following 10 years. Under an agreement with New York City's government, half of the property taxes for the city's HQ2 campus would be waived, and the exempt amount would go to the city's PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) fund to pay for infrastructure improvements in New York City. Both states proposed that Amazon be given access to a helipad, and the New York state government also promised to upgrade infrastructure in conjunction with HQ2's construction there. Amazon was said to have chosen New York City as one of the sites for HQ2 because of the city's highly skilled pool of talent; existing tech, finance, and media industries; and strong university system, including Columbia University and Cornell Tech. = Cancellation = After the HQ2 campus in New York City was announced, officials representing parts of Queens, such as U.S. Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, State Senator Michael Gianaris, and Assemblyman Ron Kim, announced their disapproval. Ocasio-Cortez, Van Bramer, and Gianaris all expressed concern that Amazon would receive tax breaks while critical infrastructure, such as the New York City Subway, was deteriorating, and the city's public school and health care systems were underfunded. In a Twitter post, Ocasio-Cortez raised further concerns about the affordability of housing in Queens, since housing prices around the HQ2 campus in Queens began rising in anticipation of the campus's construction. Kim and Fordham University professor Zephyr Teachout wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times in which they stated that the city should \\"not offer incentives and giveaways to an internet giant known for squashing small businesses.\\" Politico reported that the Long Island City location would be built on land intended for 6,000 homes, including 1,500 affordable homes, to which State Senator Michael Gianaris said, \\"The more we learn about this deal, the worse it gets.\\" On February 14, 2019, Amazon announced that it would cancel the planned Long Island City location due to opposition. The company also said that it would continue developing the Crystal City and Nashville locations. The New York Times reported that de Blasio and Cuomo were \\"blindsided\\" by Amazon's decision when informed by Amazon VP Jay Carney. New York governor Andrew Cuomo blamed Democrats in the New York State Senate for the cancellation, and New York City mayor de Blasio said that Amazon \\"threw away that opportunity,\\" by making the announcement. In response, Ocasio-Cortez stated: \\"If we were willing to give away $3 billion for this deal, we could invest $3 billion in our district ourselves if we want to. We could hire more teachers, we can fix our subways, we can put a lot of people to work for that money if we wanted to.\\" Mayor de Blasio, among others, criticized her, and those who had made similar remarks, for suggesting the money, mostly in the form of tax credits, was now free to be spent elsewhere. Activist organizations also argued that, in Amazon's absence, the original plans to build 6,000 homes should be re-adopted. In the weeks following Amazon's decision, Governor Cuomo phoned multiple Amazon executives and even Jeff Bezos, personally asking them to reconsider and guaranteeing them \\"support.\\" The Partnership for New York City placed an open letter in The New York Times stating that Cuomo \\"will take personal responsibility for the project's state approval.\\" The letter is signed by Hakeem Jeffries, Carolyn Maloney, Andrew D. Hamilton, David M. Solomon, David N. Dinkins, and Ajay Banga, among others. According to an interview with CNBC, Amazon's vice president of public policy Brian Huseman denied that politics rather than logistics were a factor in Amazon choosing to cancel its New York location. In December 2019, Amazon announced that it had signed a new lease for of space in the Hudson Yards neighborhood to accommodate 1,500 employees. The company already has 3,500 tech employees in the New York City area. Cuomo called the cancellation the \\"greatest tragedy\\" he'd seen during his tenure as governor of New York in February 2019.  Northern Virginia  1770 Crystal Drive being renovated National Landing is an area in Northern Virginia encompassing parts of the Crystal City and Pentagon City neighborhoods of Arlington County and the Potomac Yard neighborhood in the city of Alexandria that has been announced as the location for Amazon.com, Inc.'s HQ2 headquarters project. While redevelopment efforts in the area had already begun as early as 2014, the cross-jurisdictional neighborhood was branded and announced as \\"National Landing\\" in 2018 as a part of local economic development plans to bring Amazon HQ2 to the area. The announcement also included plans to build a graduate- school satellite university campus of Virginia Tech in the area. The \\"National Landing\\" name derives, in part, from the area's proximity to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The area includes an existing Washington Metro station at Crystal City as well as the planned Potomac Yard station. The Virginia Railway Express (VRE) commuter rail system also has a Crystal City station. The Metroway, a bus rapid transit system, runs through the area, with 15 stations covering the area from Arlington's Pentagon City station to Alexandria's Braddock Road station (south of National Landing), with some of this route located in an exclusive busway. Future planning for the area includes a pedestrian bridge to connect National Landing to Reagan National Airport and improvements to the existing Metro rail stations. Virginia offered performance-based incentives which included a workforce cash grant of $550 million for the first 25,000 jobs Amazon created that paid an average salary of $150,000 by 2030. The state would give an additional $200 million for the next 12,850 qualifying jobs created by 2034. Arlington County would also give an additional $23 million in cash grants, to be disbursed over 15 years, contingent on Amazon reaching a certain office size and the gradual increased revenue from a tax collected from the county's hotel rooms. The county also offered an estimated $28 million in infrastructure improvements tied to the property taxes of the Pentagon City and Crystal City area. https://d39w7f4ix9f5s9.cloudfront.net/a1/f2/85b7a8db41379e151054ff05e815/commonwealth- of-virginia-agreement.pdf https://arlington.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&event;_id=1355&meta;_id=184432 https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2018/11/13/virginias-win-of- amazon-hq2-wasnt-just-based-on.html The state's initial offer was actually close to $1 billion, according to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.

The instrument uses lasers on a lander to measure the mineralogy and elemental composition of rocks on the surface of Venus. If selected and developed at some future opportunity, the VICI mission would send two identical landers to unexplored Tesserae regions thought to be ancient exposed surfaces that had not undergone volcanic resurfacing. The two landers would measure atmospheric composition and structure during their descent at a level of detail that has not been possible on earlier missions. The landers would also analyze surface chemistry, mineralogy, and morphology at their landing site.  Scientific payload  VICI's proposed payloads includes a copy of the neutral mass spectrometer and tunable laser spectrometer currently used by the Curiosity rover to provide surface mineralogy and elemental composition. A gamma-ray spectrometer would perform measurements of naturally radioactive elements to a depth of ~10 cm.

She was the author of Songs of the South. Choice Selections from Southern Poets from Colonial Times to the Present Day. Joel Chandler Harris, who furnished an introduction to the book, said that, as far as he knew, this volume was the first of American anthologies devoted wholly to verse produced by southern writers. Early years and education Jennie Thornley Clarke was born circa 1866 on the banks of James River, Virginia. But she said she was a native Georgia although she was born among the F. F. Vs (first families of Vermont). Her father was a poet, but he died in early manhood. Brought up in a library and carefully taught by her mother, she was twice graduated with the highest honors; first, by a female college in Georgia and afterwards (in 1889), by the University of Nashville. Career Immediately elected to the chair of Latin in the State Industrial College in Mississippi, she remained there until called to the same chair in the Georgia College & State University in Milledgeville. Her extraordinary memory seemed to contain a whole library, and every line of Virgil or Horace recalled to her a wealth of illustrations from ancient and modern English poets. This exceptional acquaintance with poetry, coupled with her ability and experience as a critic, made her singularly fit for the task she undertook, that of collecting the highlights of southern poetry in a volume under the title of Songs of the South. She wrote for many periodicals, chiefly educational. Songs of the South Songs of the South. Choice Selections from Southern Poets from Colonial Times to the Present Day (Lippincott, 1896) was collected and edited by Clarke. It included an appendix of brief biographical notes.

He raced in at least four countries and won four of his seventeen races. A specialist sprinter, he showed his best form as a two-year- old in 1985, when he won three races including the Phoenix Stakes. He did not win again until 1987, when he won the Ostermann-Pokal in Germany. He made no impact as a sire of winners. Background Roaring Riva was a \\"strong\\", \\"rangy\\" bay horse with a white star and a white sock on his right hind leg, bred in England by the Newsells Park Stud. As a yearling he was put up for auction and sold for 15,000 guineas. He entered the ownership of Billy Gaff, the former manager of Rod Stewart (and founder of Riva Records), and was sent into training with Ray Laing at his Delamere House stable at Lambourn. Laing trained horses for many other people in the pop music industry including Chris Wright and Dave Robinson: his training yard was also visited by George Martin, Alvin Stardust, Liza Goddard and Robert Morley and was described as Berkshire's answer to Annabel's. Roaring Riva was one of the best horses sired by Music Boy, a sprinter whose wins included the Gimcrack Stakes in 1975 and the King George Stakes in the following year. His dam Elton Abbess showed modest racing ability, winning three minor races from 22 starts. She was descended from the British broodmare Perfume (foaled 1933) who was the female- line ancestor of several other major winners including My Babu, Sayani and English Prince. Racing career 1985: two-year-old season Roaring Riva began his racing career by winning a maiden race over five furlongs at Windsor Racecourse and then followed up by taking a minor event over six furlongs at the same track. In early July he was sent to York Racecourse to contest the Black Duck Stakes and finished second, beaten half a length by Nomination, a colt who went on to beat Green Desert in the Richmond Stakes. The colt was then sent to Ireland and moved up in class for the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes over six furlongs on soft ground at Phoenix Park Racecourse. Ridden by Ray Cochrane he started the 4/1 second favourite behind the highly regarded, but previously unraced Tate Gallery, with the best-fancied of the other eleven runners being the unbeaten filly Sherkraine, Devil's Run and Mr John. Roaring Riva was among the leaders from the start, went to the front two furlongs out and held off the challenge of the filly So Directed to win by three quarters of a length. Laing recalled that it was \\"quite a day. We had private planes, champagne, the lot!\\" Roaring Riva failed to add to his reputation in three subsequent races that year. He finished unplaced behind the filly Bambolona in the Sirenia Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse in September and later that month came home eighth of the nine runners in the Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury. On his final appearance of the year he was dropped back to five furlongs for the Cornwallis Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in October and finished unplaced behind Hallgate. At the end of the year, the independent Timeform organisation gave Roaring Riva a rating of 103, making him 29 pounds inferior to their top-rated juvenile Huntingdale. In their annual Racehorses of 1985 Timeform praised Laing's skill at placing the horse to win a Group 1 race but opined that Roaring Riva was \\"some way removed from top class\\". 1986: three-year-old season After finishing fourth over five furlongs on his three-year-old debut Roaring Riva contested the Greenham Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury on 19 April and finished fourth of the nine runners behind Faustus. After the race he was sold privately and transferred to the stable of Willie Musson at Newmarket. He was unplaced in four subsequent races, including the Vernons Sprint Cup, producing his best effort on his final start when he finished a close fifth behind Parioli in the Prix de Seine-et-Oise at Maisons- Laffitte Racecourse in late September. 1987: four-year-old season Roaring Riva finished unplaced on his first two starts in the spring of 1987 and was then off the track for two months. In June he was sent to Germany to contest the Group 3 Ostermann-Pokal over 1200 metres at Gelsenkirchen. Ridden by MIchael Wigham he won narrowly from the locally trained five-year-old Germinal, with the French challenger Cedrico in third. After finishing unplaced on his only subsequent start Roaring Riva was retired from racing. Stud record Roaring Riva began his career as a breeding stallion at the Cliffords Farm Stud at Richmond, North Yorkshire. He sired a few minor winners but nothing of any consequence. His last reported foals were born in 1999.

Biography  Talcott was born in Glastonbury, Connecticut on December 6, 1786. In 1813, he entered the Army as a Third Lieutenant of Infantry, and then within a matter of weeks, was promoted to the rank of Second Lieutenant. Initially, he was stationed on the islands in New York Harbor. By August of the same year, he was transferred to Ordnance duty and promoted to First Lieutenant. After declining an opportunity to be a Captain in the 41st Infantry Regiment, he accepted a Captaincy in the Ordnance Corps. He was placed in command of the Arsenal in New York City, and then spent some time in a similar capacity at the Arsenal in Albany, New York. He reverted to the rank of First Lieutenant in May 1814 and was retained on Ordnance duty after the War of 1812 had concluded. His next assignment took him to Massachusetts where the new arsenal at Watertown was constructed under his supervision. Following command at Watertown, he was assigned command at Allegheny Arsenal, near Pittsburgh. In 1821, he transferred to the 2nd Artillery and remained detailed to ordnance duty. Talcott was given a brevet promotion to Major in August 1823 for ten years of faithful service in one grade. In February 1824, while Talcott was in command of the Allegheny Arsenal, a convicted deserter escaped from the post stockade. Talcott had the man horsewhipped when he was recaptured, believing this action preferable to seeking a special order from higher headquarters suspending the prisoner's sentence for a period of time so that he might prepare for trial on the new charges. The prisoner escaped again but was not subsequently apprehended. Brought up on charges of having abused the prisoner, Talcott testified that he had ordered what he considered to be a justifiable whipping, and was adjudged not guilty of illegal and unmilitary conduct. Displeased with the manner in which the case had been handled, the Adjutant General directed that Talcott be retried. A new court martial confirmed the judgement of the 1823 panel, and the matter was dropped. In September 1824, Talcott was appointed commanding officer of Watervliet Arsenal, a post he held until January 1832. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in May 1832 and assigned as the Inspector of Arsenals and Armories for the Ordnance Corps. In April 1839, Talcott was made Acting Chief of the Ordnance Bureau. In 1842, he was appointed Assistant Chief of Ordnance, although he had already been performing most of the major administrative tasks for the department for three years. In his new post, he had effective day-to-day charge of all departmental activities. The expansion of Ordnance Department responsibilities which took place before and during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, including the establishment of new ordnance depots and the elaboration of the department's field service operations, was largely accomplished under his direction. On March 25, 1848, Talcott was promoted to Colonel and became the 3rd Chief of Ordnance, following the death of Colonel George Bomford. On March 3, 1849, Talcott was promoted to Brevet Brigadier General, with a date of rank from May 30, 1848, for his outstanding efforts in supporting the Army during the Mexican War. During his tenure, an elaborate study of European ordnance, made by Major Alfred Mordecai, probably the department's a best scientific authority, was completed in 1849, which resulted in the establishment of the first comprehensive and pragmatic field artillery system for the Army. In the summer of 1851, General Talcott was relieved of his duties and court-martialed at the direction of Secretary of War Charles Conrad following a dispute over the awarding of munitions contracts to a Southern contractor. Secretary Conrad, in office but a short time, had chosen to review all procurement arrangements with civilian contractors. In spite of a long-standing departmental policy distinguishing between open purchases and formal contracts, General Talcott had been authorized to purchase ordnance materiel at his discretion for more than a decade. In addition, differences between Secretary Conrad and General Talcott over personnel assignments and the injudicious actions of Brevet Colonel Benjamin Huger, who had proceeded with the munitions contract without General Talcott's full knowledge or approval combined to bring about General Talcott's dismissal from the Army. Colonel Huger was never brought up on charges although he was admonished by President Fillmore. While a good many of those familiar with the case felt that the facts did not warrant so severe a verdict and attested to General Talcott's demonstrated honesty and probity in his career, the sentence was not reversed. Subsequent efforts by several members of the U.S. Senate either to have that body officially inquire into the circumstances of General Talcott's case or to provide some financial relief for him in his retirement were to no avail. General Talcott died on April 25, 1862, at the age of 75.

The company produces 60 tonnes of caviar annually, making it the largest producer of caviar in the world and responsible for 30% of world production. Kaluga Queen supplies caviar for 21 of the 26 3-starred Michelin restaurants in Paris. History Kaluga Queen was founded in 2003 by Hangzhou Qiandaohu Xunlong Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., a caviar company affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences. The caviar processing facility was constructed in 2004 and the Kaluga Queen brand created in the following year. Several years after the founding of the company, CITES imposed a severe curtailment of wild caviar from the Caspian Sea region, creating an opportunity for caviar farming startups to take market share from the traditional caviar powers of Russia and Iran. Production The sturgeon are farmed at Qiandao Lake, a man-made lake surrounded by little in the way of industry. There are about 50,000 sturgeon maturing at the farm. At age 6 when the sex of the sturgeon becomes apparent, the males are separated from females for immediate processing while the females continue to be nurtured in pens. The mature sturgeon are shipped in water-filled trucks from the lake to a processing facility in Quzhou. At the facility the sturgeon's eggs are taken out and \\"checked, re-rinsed, salted, and sealed in tins in less than 10 minutes\\". The sturgeon without eggs is smoked and exported mostly to Russia. The company raises 5 different species of sturgeon each producing a different variety including beluga. Reception Kaluga Queen's caviar has been favorably reviewed. A writer for Newsweek praised the brand's Schrenckii caviar as having peerless \\"power and intensity\\". French chef Alain Ducasse serves it at his portfolio of restaurants. Media coverage of Keluga Queen has often focused on the Chinese origins of the brand but not the quality, noting the lack of association between China and caviar.

The neighborhood is located on the city's West Side, and was built in 1939. It was the first public housing built in the city and is currently made up of three different properties: Alaz√°n, Apache and Guadalupe Homes. It is also one of the first public housing projects in the United States and originally served a predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood.  History  San Antonio had the largest Mexican population in Texas in 1930 and most were unskilled laborers with low-paying jobs. Because of the poverty that most people of Mexican descent lived in, there was a \\"miserable standard of living.\\" In 1930, only 30% of Mexican Americans were homeowners in San Antonio, as compared to 40% black and 50% white homeowners. Alaz√°n-Apache Courts was funded by the United States Housing Authority (USHA) in September 1937. It was originally created to house \\"exclusively Mexican residents.\\" The project had the support of a local priest, Father Carmelo Tranchese, who was the pastor of the Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. He was also one of the five commissioners on the newly created San Antonio Housing Authority (SAHS). The project also had support from Mayor Charles K. Quin, Congressman Fontaine Maury Maverick, the Junior Chamber of Commerce and the new group, Liga de Leales Latinoamericanos (League of Loyal Latin Americans). The funds set aside by the USHA in 1937 were eventually able to be released when the city of San Antonio passed a resolution agreeing to the stipulations of the USHA on May 5, 1938. When the project nearly stalled, Tranchese wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt, describing the conditions of the people in the area and asked for her support. Tranchese's decision to write Roosevelt paid off, with the first lady ensuring that the projects would go ahead. Work began by demolishing the substandard homes already occupying the site. New buildings were constructed in 1939. The first tenants were allowed to start living in completed buildings in August 1940. The buildings were made of hollow tile and concrete and covered an area of about sixty acres. Rent for the buildings in the community was based on income and by the mid 1940s, there were around 4,500 residents, half of which were children. The buildings had the \\"rare amenity of a private bathroom.\\" All of the 2,554 single-family units were open to all tenants by the end of 1942. By 1945, there were around 4,994 people living in the project. While the project tried to rehouse people who had been displaced by the projects, families whose income was too high to qualify were not given any help to relocate. In 1969, the project was described in a piece published by the Arizona Daily Star as a place \\"where some 6,000 Mexican Americans live in wretched poverty and frequent hunger.\\" Plans to renovate the community went out for a contract bid between four different Mexican American contractors in 1970. In the 1980s, 99% of the residents were Hispanic and it was claimed that this was due to \\"voluntary segregation.\\" In the 1990s, it was considered the largest project in San Antonio and faced with issues of serious overcrowding. Some of the buildings were renovated in the 1990s and new buildings were built based on the architecture of the Guadalupe Homes nearby. In October 2019, a group of Alazan residents appeared before the San Antonio Housing Commission to speak on many issues, citing illegal evictions, excessive fees, false lease violations, and harassment. The tenants, lead by the Historic Westside Residents Association, lobby to preserve the Alazan/Apache homes which are currently set to be torn down and replaced with luxury lofts in a mixed income setting that only allows 10% of its residents public housing tenants. The gentrification of the Westside is a growing debate. In 2020, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named the project as one of America's most endangered historic places.

Early life Nella Frank Brown was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on May 7, 1858. Her father, Dr. Enoch Brown, was an eminent physician of Springfield, for some years, and afterwards moved to New York, where he died, while Pond was quite young. The family then went to Middletown, Connecticut, and finally became permanent residents of Boston. Career Nella Brown Pond, A woman of the century Nella Brown Pond was an accomplished reader and stood in the front rank of the women of America who made their mark upon the platform. In Boston Pond's natural dramatic talent became known to a few friends, who induced her to become a member of the Park Dramatic Company, an amateur organization of great excellence. She appeared for the first time as Margaret Elmore in Love's Sacrifice and achieved an instantaneous success. She remained with the company during that season, and her great dramatic talent secured for her a widespread popularity and won recognition from prominent professionals. She received numerous flattering offers from managers of leading metropolitan theaters, but refused them all, having conscientious scruples against going on the stage. Mrs. Thomas Barry, then leading lady of the Boston Theater, became greatly interested in her and advised that she appear upon the lyceum platform as a reader, prophesying that she would become celebrated. Through Mrs. Barry's exertions an engagement was effected with the Redpath Lyceum Bureau, and Pond at once assumed a position and gained a popularity which successive seasons only served to intensify. Personal life In 1880 Nella Brown Pond became the wife of Ozias W. Pond, of Boston, a well-known manager of musical and literary celebrities. Her husband died in February, 1892. She died on September 14, 1893, in Boston, from typhoid fever.

Synopsis The first act takes place at the Split waterfront right before the start of the First World War, the second in Quimperville, a small town near Marseille, just before the end of the War, and the third in Split after the war in the apartment of the Little Floramye's girlfriend.http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/188/tekst-iznad-glazbe-16537/ First act August. Carnival night. The Split waterfront is decorated with lanterns and flowers. In a crowd of students, Mirko is looking for his Floramye. Three older cavaliers get teased by the group of young man. In particular, they tease Mr. Bepo Pegula for his unsuccessful seductive tendencies. Floramye arrives at the waterfront. She, \\" the most beautiful flower of Split\\", sneaked out from home regardless of mother's ban to do so, and expresses love towards Mirko. There is also a strict \\"guardian of morality and order\\" present who tries to impress the people by saying: \\"In the name of the steps, three laws back!\\", but also gets teased by a group of young men. Mrs. Petronila, angry at Floramye for disobeying her, came to the waterfront to look for Floramye and eventually sees her dancing with Mr. Dan and Mr. File. Floramye runs away when she sees her angry mother, while Dan and File try to calm her down. The most exciting part of the carnival - the election of the Carnival Queen, is getting closer. Floramye wins and chooses Mirko as her king. At the same time, boys tell Mr. Bepo that Floramye scheduled for a date with him. Mr. Bepo shows up at the alleged meeting location with a large bouquet, but instead of Floramye, who is at the time with Mirko, meets Mrs. Petrolina who arrived after hearing that someone was having a date with her daughter. Mr. Bepo gets hit in the head by Mrs. Petronila who also demanded form the guard to arrest him because of the attempted seduction of the juvenile. Second act January. Quimperville, a small place near Marseille. End of the First World War. Floramye left Split and now works as a nurse in a military hospital but before that, she worked in Paris as a cabaret dancer. During the war, she lost contact with her parents and has changed her name to Suzette. War hero, Lieutenant Petar Petroviƒá, is set to arrive at the military hospital where she works. Everyone is preparing for the celebration. Mr. Bepo Pegula is also at Marseille where he met the English paramedic Miss Evelin Beauty-Flower. She invites him to the celebration at the military hospital. He accepts, puts on generals uniform and thus provokes confusion when he arrives at the hospital because everyone thinks that he is Petar Petroviƒá. When real Petar Petroviƒá finally arrives, Suzette recognizes him as Mirko but hides because she is afraid that he would be angry at her for working as a cabaret dancer. They eventually meet, and he forgives her. Third act February. Split. Mr. Bepo Pegula brags about his love adventures with an \\"English princess of incredible beauty\\" and various military accomplishments, but when Mirko, Floramye, and Evelin arrive to Split his lies are exposed. The act ends with laughter, poetry, and lovingly happy ending.

It is one of three isomers of tetrabromobenzene. The compound is a white solid. 1,2,4,5-Tetrabromobenzene is an important metabolite of the flame retardant hexabromobenzene.  Preparation  The synthesis of 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene has already been reported in 1865 from benzene and excess bromine in a sealed tube at 150 ¬∞C. However, the clearly reduced melting point of about 160 ¬∞C indicates impurities in the final product. In his 1885 dissertation, Adolf Scheufelen published the synthesis of a purer sample using iron(III) chloride FeCl as a catalyst, isolated as \\"pretty needles\\" (\\"sch√∂nen Nadeln\\"). Synthese von 1,2,4,5-Tetrabrombenzol The synthesis can also be carried out in solution in chloroform or tetrachloromethane and yields 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene in 89% yield. This reaction can also be carried out in a laboratory experiment with excess bromine and iron nails (as starting material for iron (III) bromide FeBr). The intermediate stage is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which reacts further with excess bromine to give 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene.  Reactions   Building block for liquid crystals and fluorescent dyes  Owing to its symmetrical structure and reactivity, 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene is a precursor to nematic liquid crystals with crossed mesogens and for columnar (discotic) liquid crystals with an extensive planar, \\"board-like\\" tetrabenzoanthracene core. Synthesis of discotic LC from 1,2,4,5-Tetrabromobenzene. In a one-pot reaction, 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene reacts with 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the alkylating agent 1-bromopentane, the Wittig reagent methyltriphenylphosphonium iodide, the base potassium carbonate, the phase transfer catalyst tetrabutylammonium bromide, the Heck reagent palladium(II)acetate and the Heck co-catalyst 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) in dimethylacetamide obtaining directly a symmetrical tetraalkoxylstilbene as E-isomer in 17% yield. Synthese eines symmetrischer Tetraalkoxystilbens Due to their pronounced œÄ-conjugation such compounds could be potentially applied as optical brighteners, OLED materials or liquid crystals. N-alkyl- tetraaminobenzenes are available from 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene in high yields, which can be cyclized with triethyl orthoformate and acids to benzobis(imidazolium) salts (BBI salts) and oxidized with oxygen to form 1,4-benzoquinone diimines. Synthese von BBI-Salzen und Benzochinondiiminen BBI salts are versatile fluorescent dyes with emission wavelengths Œª between 329 and 561 nm, pronounced solvatochromism and strong solvent-dependent Stokes shift, which can be used as protein tag for fluorescent labeling of proteins.  Starting material for arynes  From 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene, a 1,4-monoarine can be prepared in-situ with one equivalent of n-butyllithium by bromine abstraction, which reacts immediately with furan to form 6,7-dibromo-1,4-epoxy-1,4-dihydronaphthalene (6,7-dibromonaphthalene-1,4-endoxide) in 70% yield. Bildung eines 1,4-Monoarins aus 1,2,4,5-Tetrabrombenzol When 2,5-dialkylfurans (e.g. 2,5- (di-n-octyl)furan) are used, the dibrominated monoendoxide is formed in 64% yield, from which dibromo-5,8-di-n-octylnaphthalene is formed with zink powder/titanium tetrachloride in 88% yield. Synthese von Dibromdioctylnaphthalin aus 1,2,4,5-Tetrabrombenzol Upon treatment with titanium tetrachloride and zinc dust, the endoxide is deoxygenated yielding 2,3-dibromnaphthalene. The endoxide reacts with 3-sulfolene in a Diels-Alder reaction upon elimination of sulfur dioxide. The resulting tricyclic adduct converts to 2,3-dibromoanthracene in good yield. If the dibromene oxide is allowed to react further with furan, in the presence of n-butyllithium or potassium amide or via an intermediate 1,4-aryne the tricyclic 1,4-adduct 1,4:5.8-diepoxy-1,4,5,8-tetrahydroanthracene is formed in 71% yield as a syn- anti-mixture. With sodium amide in ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME), however, the dibromene oxide behaves as a 1,3-aryne equivalent and forms with furan a phenanthrene-like tricyclic 1,3-adduct, which can react with furan and sodium amide to a triphenylene derivative (1,3,5-tris-arene). [2+4] cycloadditions with 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene sometimes proceed in very high yields, such as the reaction of a dihalogen-substituted 1,3-diphenyl- isobenzofuran to a tetrahalogenated anthracene derivative (98%), which is converted successively further with 1,3-diphenyl isobenzofuran in 65% yield to a pentacene derivative and furan to a hexacene derivative (67%). Bildung eines Hexacen-Derivats aus 1,2,4,5-Tetrabrombenzol The crosslinking of benzimidazole-modified polymers provides materials with a high absorption capacity for carbon dioxide, which could be suitable for CO separation from gas mixtures. Bildung eines vernetzten Benzimidazolpolymers It is the starting material for mono- and bis-aryines.  Safety  1,2,4,5-Tetrabromobenzene is a liver toxic degradation product of the flame retardant hexabromobenzene and was already in 1987 detected in Japan in mother's milk samples.

History Heidenberg Castle was the first of four castles built to defend and control the region around Obersaxen. The Obersaxen plateau first appears in historic records in 765 when Bishop Tello gave his farms and meadows there to Disentis Abbey. In 806 it became an Imperial Estate, which it remained until 956 when Emperor Otto I donated the village and the village church back to the Bishop of Chur. To control this important village along the Rhine river, four castles were built at various points throughout the Middle Ages. The first was Heidenberg above Tavanasa which may have been built as early as 1000. It was followed by Moregg and Saxenstein (around 1200) and Schwarzenstein (13th century). However, Heidenberg does not appear in any surviving medieval records. In 1468 the inheritance of the Counts of Rh√§z√ºns the other three castles around Obersaxen were mentioned, but Heidenberg was omitted, probably indicating that it had already fallen into ruin. In 1556 the Obersaxen castles of Schwarzenburg, Saxenstein and Heydnischburg were fixed as the border between Obersaxen and Waltensburg. In 1573 the chronicle of Ulrich Campell calls the ruins Heidabergum. Today only a few ruins of the tower and outer wall remain. Castle site The castle is located atop a small, rocky outcropping above the village of Tavanasa in the Surselva valley. The castle site is surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs and can only be reached from the fourth or mountain side. Though even on the mountain side, a smaller cliff partially blocks the way. Due to its isolated location and strong natural barriers, Heidenberg may have originally been built as a refuge castle before eventually becoming the home of minor knights. The top of the outcropping is about with castle ruins on the south-west side. The polygonal tower was built with walls that are thick. Portions of the castle walls are still visible along the south and west sides of the outcropping. There were probably other buildings inside the castle, but no traces remain.

Hayes and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden. After an extremely heated election dispute, a compromise was eventually reached where Hayes would become U.S. President in exchange for the end of Reconstruction and a withdrawal of U.S. federal troops from the South. The Democratic nomination fight Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes was Tilden's opponent in the 1876 presidential race. A photograph of Samuel Jones Tilden. After the Democrats captured control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1874, they believed that they had their best chance in 20 years of winning the U.S. Presidency. In the 1874 elections, a new set of Democratic party leaders emerged which included New York Governor Samuel J. Tilden. Tilden was previously the chair of the New York Democratic Party as well as the campaign manager for Horatio Seymour's unsuccessful 1868 presidential campaign and was notable for both toppling Boss Tweed (the corrupt boss of the Tammany Hall political machine) and prosecuting the Canal Ring. As the Governor of the most populous U.S. state, Tilden was an obvious choice and the front-runner for the 1876 Democratic presidential nomination. At the 1876 Democratic National Convention, Tilden easily won the required two-thirds of delegates to win the Democratic presidential nomination on the first ballot, winning 535 delegates to 140¬Ω for his nearest rival Indiana Governor Thomas A. Hendricks. Hendricks was then selected as Tilden's running mate due to him being from the crucial swing state of Indiana as well as due to the fact that \\"his support of soft- money balanced Tilden's hard-money stance on the divisive 'money-question.'\\" Meanwhile, on the Republican side, reformist Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes won the Republican nomination as a compromise candidate after front-runner James G. Blaine failed in his nomination bid due to his corruption scandals. Campaign The 1876 Democratic platform demanded the repeal of the Specie Payment Resumption Act, condemned the Grant Administration's corruption, reaffirmed the Reconstruction Amendments, denounced Congressional Reconstruction as both coercive and corrupt, supported a tariff only for revenue, conservation of public lands, and civil service reform. Meanwhile, the Republicans \\"waved the bloody shirt\\" by associating the Democrats with the Confederacy and criticized Tilden's questionable tax returns, early association with Boss Tweed, poor health, and conflicting views on the \\"money question\\" in comparison to his running mate. A painting of the Electoral Commission with spectators. Justice Joseph P. Bradley, the decisive vote on the Electoral Commission. Tilden's campaign aggressively focused on winning the crucial New York state and its 35 electoral votes while the Grant Administration spent nearly $300,000--mostly in the South and in New York City --on deputy marshals and supervisors whose job was to secure a fair election (there was violence against and intimidation of Black voters by the Democrats in the Southern U.S. in 1876). Meanwhile, the Democratic-controlled House made a crucial blunder when it passed a statehood bill for Colorado in the middle of the campaign. While the Democrats might have believed that Colorado would vote for Tilden, it ended up giving its electors to Hayes and thus provided the decisive margin for Hayes's victory in the election. Results Puck political cartoon which depicts the Compromise of 1877. Rutherford Hayes and the \\"Solid South\\" (depicted as a Southern belle here) are shown walking away together while Roscoe Conkling looks on. While both candidates went to bed on Election Night, Tuesday, Nov. 7, 1876, assuming that Tilden had won (indeed, Tilden had won the national popular vote by a 51%-48% margin), late results from the West made the election outcome unclear. Tilden had won 184 electoral votes (one short of a majority) whereas 20 electoral votes (one from Oregon and 19 from the South) were disputed. The dispute over the 19 electoral votes from the Southern U.S. was based on the fact that there was a dispute over who had carried the states of Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina. After some debate, a 15-member Electoral Commission was created to decide the fate of the disputed electoral votes and thus the outcome of the election. This commission included five U.S. Senators (three Republicans and two Democrats), five U.S. Representatives (three Democrats and two Republicans), and five U.S. Supreme Court members (four of whom were selected by geographic diversity and who would later select the fifth one). The commission‚Äôs decisions were to be legally regarded as final unless both houses of Congress overrode these decisions. Out of the five Supreme Court members of this commission, there were two Republicans, two Democrats, and one independent-- U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Davis. In an attempt to win Davis's favor, the Democratic-Greenback coalition in the new Illinois legislature appointed Davis to the U.S. Senate. To their surprise, however, Davis immediately resigned from the Electoral Commission in order to take his U.S. Senate seat. Meanwhile, Davis was replaced on the Electoral Commission by Republican Joseph P. Bradley. Ultimately, the Electoral Commission voted on a partisan 8 to 7 vote to award all 20 disputed electoral votes to Hayes (with Justice Bradley being the decisive vote in all of these votes), thus allowing him to defeat Tilden and win the U.S. Presidency by one electoral vote (with 185 electoral votes going to Hayes while 184 electoral votes went to Tilden). To get the Democrats--especially Southern Democrats--to acquiesce in Hayes's victory, Hayes and the Republicans agreed to withdraw all U.S. federal troops from the Southern U.S. and thus to cause Reconstruction to come to an end. Over the next 80 years, the Solid South would be a reliable Democratic bloc in U.S. politics. Samuel Tilden waited until June 13, 1877 before he conceded the 1876 U.S. presidential election to Rutherford Hayes.

R1, R2, Y1, Y2 can be different substitution groups. 200x200px Phosphirenium ions () are a series of organophosphorus compounds containing unsaturated three-membered ring phosphorus (V) heterocycles and œÉ*-aromaticity is believed to be present in such molecules. Many of the salts containing phosphirenium ions have been isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.  Synthesis  The first series of phosphirenium ions were synthesized by reacting alkynes with methyl- or phenylphosphonous dichloride and aluminum trichloride. These reactions may be regarded as formal addition of \\"RClP+\\" to alkynes. 334x334px [2+1]-cycloaddition reactions between phosphaalkynes and chlorocarbene give phosphirenes, which serve as starting materials for the generation of phosphirenium species. 560x560px Treatment of diphenylphosphine oxide with diphenylacetylene affords phosphirenium species. 257x257px Phosphirenium ions can also be obtained from reaction between phosphiranes and alkynes, where \\"RClP+\\" is formally transferred from alkenes to alkynes.253x253px  Characterizations  In the literature, 31P NMR spectra of phosphirenium ions show upfield shifts (‚àí57.3 ppm when R1 = R2 = Y1 = CH3, Y2 = Cl). Large coupling constants J are also found in 1H NMR, and are comparable to those found in cyclopropenium ions. The first phosphirenium ion characterized by X-ray Crystallography has the following structural formula: 106x106px In the refined crystal structure, average phosphorus‚Äìcyclic carbon distance has been found to be 1.731(12) √Ö, roughly corresponding to a bond order of 1.5. For comparison, typical single- and double-bond P‚ÄìC distances are 1.86 √Ö and 1.68 √Ö, respectively.  Reactivity  Reminiscent of œÄ-ligand exchange in coordination compounds, a phosphirenium ion may undergo alkyne exchange with other alkynes to give a mixture of phospinirenium species in equilibrium. Kinetically, elimination of alkyne from the cation is suggested to be rate-determining step. 337x337px In addition, the three-membered ring of phosphirenium ion may be broken. Successive reactions with suitable nucleophile are able to proceed on the electrophilic phosphorus atom. With the presence of an alkyne: 528x528px With the presence of water or alcohol: 284x284px 288x288px Electrophilic B(C6F5)3 readily reacts with phosphinylalkynes at room temperature to give phosphirenium-borate zwitterions as intermediates, which then generate carbon-phosphorus œÉ bond activation products at higher temperature. The products are of interest to material science. Dotted line in product indicates weak interaction between boron and phosphor atoms (see frustrated Lewis pair). 450x450px  œÉ*-Aromaticity  Qualitative molecular orbital (MO) diagram of a phophirenium ion can be obtained by linear combination of orbitals from a fragment and a bent RC=CR fragment. A low-lying œÉ* orbital from the former with ungerade symmetry interacts with both œÄ and œÄ* orbitals of the latter, creating a 2œÄ-H√ºckel system, analogous to the one in cyclopropenium ion. This effect has been named as œÉ*-aromaticity. It is noteworthy that unlike the case of cyclopropenium ion, interaction between the filled œÉ orbital of the fragment and œÄ orbitals also leads to some degree of antiaromatic character. Therefore, net 3-center conjugative effect is a combination of both œÉ* stabilizing contribution and œÉ destabilizing contribution. Electronegativity of each substituent on phosphorus plays a role as more electron-donating ones give greater degrees of antiaromatic sigma destabilization. This has been confirmed by Natural Population Analysis (NPA), where the energy changes of the reactions below were calculated with interactions between the C‚ÄìC double bond and phosphorus both turned on and off by manipulating Fock matrix elements: 315x315px Major Lewis structures of from NBO analysis. Destabilization energies were the differences between corresponding reactions: *Destabilization energy = energy (1) ‚àí energy (2) *Destabilization Energy with different Y groups: Y = F > OH > Cl > NH2 > Br > I > CH3 > H This series is in accordance with the trend of electronegativity of the ligand atoms. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis provides possible Lewis structures of a molecule and has been carried out to assess the structure of . Similar to the aromatic cyclopropenium ion, the phosphorus analog shows a resonance between the structure with carbon-carbon double bond (1, 72.02%) and the ones with carbon-phosphorus double bond (3a and 3b, 7.88% combined). In addition, the ring-opening forms 2a and 2b combined also occupy 9.08% weight.

Early life and education  Norman Charles Zammitt was born on February 3, 1931 in Toronto, Canada. His mother was Mohawk Indian of the Iroquois Nation and his father, Italian from Palermo, Sicily. When he was 7 years old, the family moved to the Caughnawaga Reservation across the St. Lawrence River from Montreal for four years then to Montreal, then to Buffalo New York, and on to settle in Southern California at age 14 in the San Gabriel Valley. Drawing was a consistent pursuit throughout Zammitt's childhood, ignited further, at age 12, by his first sight of an oil painting by a Dutch artist in a gallery window. He was also taken by animation, Disney films, drawing the characters and making up his own. His skill at cartooning carried on through high school, at both El Monte and Rosemead where he developed comic strip characters for the schools‚Äô newspapers. His talent in both classic and cartoon art won him national, regional and scholastic awards during his high school years. He moved on to Pasadena City College where his talent again was recognized and he was advised to pursue the commercial art field. The Korean war interrupted his education with his enlistment into the Air Force in 1952 and assigned as a photographer. In his one-year tour of duty in Korea, he did aerial reconnaissance photography. In his off duty hours he continued painting including a mural at an orphanage there, of Christ with Korean children. On his return to the U.S. to finish his service, on a base in Colorado, his work was as a draftsman. In 1955, he met and married his wife, Marilyn Jean and had a daughter and a son, Dawn Zammitt Crandall and Eric Zammitt, both artists today. On his discharge in 1956, Zammitt returned to finish at Pasadena City College and continued pursuing commercial art at Art Center School of Design where he had received a scholarship. However, a closer look at that art changed his mind and he applied to the Otis Art Institute (now called Otis College of Art and Design) to study fine art and received a four-year scholarship. He spent two years on curriculum and two years on his thesis. \\"He was the best student. He could do anything.\\" ‚ÄîJohn Baldessari Otis gave him a private studio where he was free to paint and create his work, unsupervised. He received his MFA in 1961.  Work   Abstract Landscapes 1957‚Äì61 Geological Landscape II, 1960 In 1960, his last year at Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles, Zammitt was invited by Felix Landau to join his gallery on the prestigious La Cienega gallery row. Landau also advanced him funds for his first studio in Pasadena. These small abstract works were done in oil, pencil, crayon, liquitex, collage and etching, and were enthusiastically received by collectors, launching his professional career. \\"...small collages which combined with an active calligraphy with placement of bright colored chips against a mahogany lacquer ground.\\" ‚ÄîArtforum Vol. No. 6, Henry Hopkins, November 1962Artforum Vol. No. 6, Henry Hopkins, November 1962 Exhibits ‚ÄúExceptionally Gifted: Recent Donations to the Norton Simon Museum‚Äù, NSM, Pasadena, Ca.

Encased in boxes, set against a black or clear background, the human figure was defined as a whole, but composed of fragments. Shown at the gallery, these paintings evoked a civil complaint for censorship which was denied in a judicial ruling. Censorship occurred at the University of New Mexico where he taught and was to exhibit. He then exhibited at a private gallery in Santa Fe. \\"The anatomical fragments change their character at the point of contacting the invisible planes of the geometric box walls.

Paintings  =Band paintings, 1974‚Äì1988, 60 works= Blue Burning, 1982 The sculptures, suspending color in space, led Zammitt back to painting on canvas entirely in the abstract in pursuit of understanding and expressing color itself. \\"For most of my life I had thought a lot about the nature of color, specifically, its sequential nature. I was drawn to it, not by a decorative or superficial attraction to design and its aesthetic application but by something deep within the colors themselves, akin to life itself, spirituality.\\"Norman Zammitt, personal writings Though the sky was his \\"model\\" it was not his intention to create landscapes or sunsets, nor to imitate nature, but to parallel the abstraction of light in paint, to correlate palette and sky. He found that none of the different theories of color were quite related to nature, so he began putting color into what he felt was their natural sequence. He began by mixing his own basic, primary or \\"parent\\" colors and from that eventually mixing colors according to his experience and ideas about how one color can become another color can become another color, etc. until it rounded the whole spectrum. Eventually it became impossible to continue by \\"eyeballing\\" colors into place so he began using logarithms and mathematical curves to graph progressions, giving the colors numerical values. This provided a means of measuring, by weight on a gram scale, extremely complex mixtures of colors in variable amounts to bend from one color to another in a smooth unbroken sequence. To verify his approach, Zammitt inquired of mathematicians at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena to shed light on his process. They were personally and professionally interested, as the study of progressions is considered to be the highest form of mathematics and therefore, highly complex. They validated in mathematical and scientific language what he was doing abstractly, and were helpful with their computers in assisting him in his calculations. Most important was their discovery that his color progression was related to the progressive growth rates of living organisms, more to this phenomenon than to anything else in mathematics, implying, perhaps, that life has something to do with color. ‚ÄúDespite their hard-edge appearance and quasi-logical structure, Norman Zammitt's paintings are magic. ‚Ä¶ it takes only a few minutes in their presence to realize something extraordinary is going on. Zammitt has taken the idea of mixing color and light beyond the zones of opticality and abstraction and pushed it into the realm of the spirit.\\" ‚ÄîThe Washington StarThe Washington Star, Norman Zammitt: A Master Painter, With Magic, Now At the Corcoran, Benjamin Forgey, February 18, 1978 In an email, Michael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum, went so far as to nominate some artists for eventual White House display. A ‚ÄúNorman Zammitt sunset would be beautiful.\\" =Fractal/Chaos Paintings, 1988‚Äì1992, 9 works= Earthworld II, 1990 In this series of paintings, Zammitt began exploring the effects of the Chaos Theory while maintaining the concepts and techniques of color relativity he developed in earlier work. Differing orders of color mixtures were painted in a spontaneous and chaotic way to bring about relationships that intertwined, intermixed and interpenetrated with each other. The color relationships were kept in their logarithmic order but their application on the canvas was brought together through the spontaneous drawing and painting of shapes resembling the fracturing, cracking and the breaking up of space.

Self Portraits 1998‚Äì2007 Self Portrait with Blue Burning, 2006 Although the City of Los Angeles declared his studio a historical site where his mural existed, Norman was unable to remain there due to expenses and decreased health and was forced to give up the large scale of his work, drastically altering the scale of his interest in color. He had begun drawing self portraits casually at a friend's request for one as a birthday gift. After leaving his studio, he continued to develop these portraits, working in his home studio over the next 7 years into a body of work approximating 200 in depictions that could be seen in series or groups. His media were pen, ink, brush, and pencil. The portraits' intent was, in his words, \\"... a very intimate exploration of the human condition, using myself as the subject matter and focal point. Every emotional aspect of the human psyche would be revealed, its relationship to an ever-increasing hostile environment and the struggle to resolve the inner and outer conflicts of the human spirit ...while expressing the promise of whatever is pure, sublime, hopeful and enduring in the human soul.\\" Later self portraits included both light hearted spin offs from known characters and more subjective, personal portraits.

Capable of filling the roles of night fighter, light bomber and ground-attack, it had mixed propulsion, having both piston engine driven propellers and jet engines. Design The P 203 was conceived as a multi-role fighter-bomber, using mixed powerplants in an otherwise conventional layout.Pohlmann (1982) At that time jet engines could provide a high maximum speed but were unreliable and suffered poor thrust at low speeds, on the other hand conventional propellers provided good thrust at low-to-medium speeds but struggled as speeds increased. By using both kinds of powerplant, excellent performance across the whole speed range could be achieved. The P 203 was to carry two of each. The fuselage was of broadly conventional layout, having a two-crew cabin at the front, a bomb bay underneath the centre and a conventional tail with remote rear gun barbette. The mid-mounted wing was straight and of two different, untapered sections. The inboard sections had a deep chord front to back and were thick enough to house the main landing gear. They ended at wing-mounted nacelles which housed the powerplants. BMW 801J radial piston engines at the front drove twin propellers in the ordinary manner, while slung below and behind each of these and faired into the nacelle was a jet engine. Three versions were studied, each having a different type of jet engine; the P 203.01 had Heinkel-Hirth HeS 011A engines, the P 203.02 a Junkers Jumo variant and the P 203.03 a BMW type. Outboard of the nacelles were thinner and shallower, lower-drag outer wing sections.Cowin (1963)Masters (1982) Besides the tail barbette, additional armament was housed in the nose. Also unusual for the era was a tricycle undercarriage arrangement, with a nosewheel retracting up beneath the cabin.

Early life Burden was born in October 1864 in Irvington, New York. He was the son of Amelia Stuart Newton Worthington (d. 1901) and Edward M. Whitehouse (d. 1870), his mother's first husband whom she married in 1863. After his father died, his mother remarried to Thomas Whiteside Rae. His full-brother was Edward Whitehouse (1866‚Äì1894) and his half-brothers were Izard Newton Whiteside Rae and Thomas Rae. His paternal grandparents were Edward Whitehouse and Julia (n√©e Cammann) Whitehouse, of the prominent Cammann Knickerbocker family. His uncle was James Henry Whitehouse, dean of the New York Stock Exchange and his cousin was Sheldon Whitehouse, U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala and Colombia. His maternal grandparents were Henry Rossiter Worthington (1817‚Äì1880), who invented the first direct-acting steam pump, and Sara Jane (n√©e Newton) Worthington (1817‚Äì1893), herself the daughter of Commodore John Thomas Newton of Alexandria, Virginia. His uncle was Charles Campbell Worthington (1854‚Äì1944), who took over his grandfather's Worthington Corporation. His grand-nephew through his brother Izard, was Thomas Newton Whiteside Rae (d. 2011). His niece was Edwina Worthington Whitehouse, who married Gregory Van Sicklen McLoughlin, a painter, and committed suicide in 1923. He was educated in New York, taking a class at St. John's School, and then abroad to complete his studies. After graduation, he spent three years traveling, including in Africa. Career After returning to the United States, he joined Edward Sweet & Co., bankers, working with them for three years. His cousin Henry Worthington Bull (1874‚Äì1958), the son of his maternal aunt Sara Newton Worthington and her husband William Lauman Bull, also worked at Edward Sweet & Co. Following Edward Sweet & Co., he joined with Edward Ludlow Hall (1872‚Äì1932) in real estate ventures. He later formed a partnership known as Mills & Whitehouse. It was dissolved and he joined John N. Golding to form Golding & Whitehouse, later Whitehouse & Porter with Clarence Porter, the only surviving son of Gen. Horace Porter, the U.S. Ambassador to France. After Porter's death, Whitehouse later founded his own real estate firm, Worthington Whitehouse Inc. in 1915, which rented and sold properties in New York, especially along Fifth Avenue and in Murray Hill, and in Newport, Rhode Island. In 1921, he stepped down as president of his firm, Worthington Whitehouse Company, Inc., and appointed Newton Rae, his relative who was a friend of Albert Eugene Gallatin, as president in his place. In 1935, several years after his death, his firm was dissolved and its president, Newton Rae, and officers joined Douglas L. Elliman & Co. Society life Whitehouse was a member of the infamous \\"Four Hundred\\" of New York Society, as dictated by Mrs. Astor and Ward McAllister and published in The New York Times on February 16, 1892. He was known for being the master of the cotillion, along with Cathleen Neilson Vanderbilt, the wife of Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt.

The ensuing surge in support and attention was referred to in the media as \\"Jacindamania\\" or the \\"Jacinda effect\\".  History  Immediately following her appointment as leader, the Labour Party was inundated with donations from the public, reaching up to NZ$700 per minute at its peak. Ardern's election was followed by a spate of positive coverage from many sections of the media, including international outlets such as CNN, with commentators referring to a \\"Jacinda effect\\" or \\"Jacindamania\\". Many subsequent public events featuring Ardern have been characterised by large crowds and capacity attendance; such as at the 2018 Labour Party Conference, where the Dunedin Town Hall was filled to its maximum 1,200 person capacity. Hundreds more people, unable to enter, queued on the street outside in a line that snaked around the building. A year after Ardern forming her government, The Guardian's Eleanor Ainge Roy reported that Jacindamania was waning in the population, with not enough of the promised change visible. When Toby Manhire, the editor of The Spinoff, reviewed the decade in December 2019, he praised Ardern for her leadership following the Christchurch mosque shootings and the Whakaari / White Island eruption:  Reaction  The \\"Jacindamania\\" phenomenon was cited as a major factor behind New Zealand gaining global attention and media influence in many reports, including the Soft Power 30 index. In a 2018 an overseas trip Ardern attracted much attention from international media, particularly after delivering a speech at the United Nations in New York. She contrasted with contemporary world leaders, being cast as an \\"antidote to Trumpism\\". Tracy Watkins stated Ardern made a cut-through on the world stage and her reception was as a \\"... torch carrier for progressive politics as a young woman who breaks the mold in a world where the political strongman is on the rise.

Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"a powerful and inspiring experience\\".

She was one of a number of 13th century lay women who led devout lives, following the example of Marie of Oignies. Called mulieres religiosae or mulieres sanctae, some gathered together in beguinages while many others lived at home practicing voluntary poverty, chastity, prayer, fasting and penance, a lifestyle known as the vita apostolica in imitation of Christ.Anke Passenier, Women on the Loose, Stereotypes of Women in the Story of the Medieval Beguines, included in Female Stereotypes in Religious Traditions, Ria Kloppenborg & Wouter J Hanegraaff, eds, Leiden: Brill Academic Publishers, 1995, pp 68-69 In Margaret‚Äôs time, such Dominican female penitents were unregulated by the Church and were under the guidance of individual spiritual advisers. A rule would not be established until Munio of Zamora‚Äôs Rule of the Brothers and Sisters of Penance of the Blessed Dominic (Regula Fratrum et Sororum Ordinis de Paenitentiae Beati Dominici) in the late 13th century.Maiju Lehmijoki-Gardner, ed. & trans., Dominican Penitent Women, Mahwah NJ: Paulist Press, 2005, pp 3-6 Life Information on Margaret comes from a biography, The Life of Margaret Ypres by Thomas of Cantimpr√© written in 1240.Thomas de Cantimpr√©, The Life of Margaret Ypres, Margot H. King, trans., Toronto: Peregrina Publishing Co., 1990. Margaret was born in Ypres into a well-off middle class family. Her father died when she was four and Margaret, with her mother and three sisters, went to live with an uncle. She showed a predilection for a holy life from a young age. While attending a local convent school, she smelled a wonderful odor on first beholding the host and begged the Abbess to be allowed to partake of the Eucharist with the nuns. From the age of seven she began severe fasting and practiced self-mortification by stuffing stinging nettles and burrs down the front of her dress. By age ten she was tearing her flesh with thorns to experience the torment of Christ. After the death of her uncle when she was 18, she turned to the Dominican Friar Zegher from Lille as her spiritual director, who encouraged her in her devotions. About this time she was attracted to a young man, but quelled her feelings and made a vow of chastity. She retreated entirely from the world and spent her days in constant prayer, even, although she rarely spoke, praying when in conversation with her mother and sisters. To avoid the temptation of men, she had her mother dismiss a twelve year old boy who was helping in the household. Margaret slept little, often due to severe headaches, ate little, kept frequent vigils, engaged in long periods of fasting and continued her self-mortification. She wore ragged clothing and would go out begging until Zegher made her stop. Any money she received from begging she gave to the lepers. Margaret had visions of Christ and of the Virgin Mary and felt angels holding her up when her austerities left her too weak to stand. Many miracles were attributed to Margaret, such as making whole some smashed eggs so the family would have something to eat, and saving her sister who was on the point of death during childbirth. Her austere lifestyle took a toll on her health and she was eventually bedridden, experiencing great pain, fevers and convulsions, all of which tribulations she bore with grace. After lingering for a year, she died at age of 21. See also *Marie of Oignies *Beguines and Beghards Notes References *Thomas de Cantimpr√©, The Life of Margaret Ypres, Margot H.

The battle is mentioned by the historian Polybius and by the Achaean poet Damagetus, who calls it the \\"Battle at the Achaean Trench\\". Prelude In the first years of the war the Aetolians had raided the Peloponnese on several occasions, and the Achaeans appeared incapable of defending their territory. For this reason, after the Battle of Caphyae, the Achaean leader Aratus of Sicyon had called on the Hellenic allies for help, and on the turn of 219/18 the Macedonian king responded, launching a winter offensive in Arcadia, Elis and Triphylia. On this occasion he captured the Aetolian general Euripidas. Based in allied Elis, Euripidas had been one of the most active Aetolian generals in the war, raiding the Western Peloponnese year after year. After his seizure, the Aetolians sent Pyrrhias of Aetolia to command their forces in Elis. But the Eleans were not satisfied with their new commander, and when they heard that Euripidas had been released on parole by the Macedonians, they asked to have him back. In the summer of 217 BC Euripidas planned to repeat his incursions of the previous years to demoralize the enemy. He therefore assembled 2000 foot and 60 horsemen, and when the Achaeans were united in assembly, he invaded the territory next to their capital Aigion. After collecting enough booty he retreated into the mountains around Leontion. Earlier that year, however, the Achaean leader Aratus had reorganized the army, creating regional commands for quicker reaction to any local threat. Hypostrategos of the Western district was then Lycus of Pharae, who moved fast enough to block the further retreat of the Aetolians in the pass between Mount Panachaikon and Mount Erymanthos near Leontion. Battle The Achaeans immediately attacked with ferocious courage, killing 400 enemies and taking 200 prisoners, among them some very prominent Eleans and Aetolians listed by Polybius.The names given are Phissias, Antanor, Clearchus, Androlochus, Evanoridas, Aristogeiton, Nicasippus and Aspasius. Evanoridas can be identified with the former Olympic victor Evanoridas of Elis, writer of a history of the Olympic games. Polybius, V 94. Moreover, they took the enemies' weapons and the whole booty away. After this success Lycus called the hipparch Demodocus with the Achaean cavalry and together they entered the territory of Elis, where they killed 200 more and took 80 prisoners.Polybius, V 94. The Achaean poet Damagetus seems to refer to the same battle in two of his epitaphs, where he talks of a \\"battle at the Achaean graben\\", specifying that the purpose of the encounter was to avenge the looting of Patras. The dedication is for one soldier on each side, a hot blooded Elean called Chaironides and a young Achaean ephebos called Machatas, who both fell in battle.Greek Anthology, VII 438 and 541. Aftermath About the same time of the land battle, the Achaean navarch took 100 prisoners on the Aetolian coast and captured two large plus one smaller enemy vessel with their entire crews, and this string of success finally helped to raise the morale of the Achaeans.Polybius, V 94. The war ended the same autumn, when the Macedonian king Philip V learned about the Roman defeat by Hannibal at Lake Trasimene and decided that Italy was a worthier battleground.

It successfully expanded performance venues from the country's prominent population centers to those much smaller communities that were able to form Concert Associations of 600‚Äì4000 subscribers. Following the Organized-Audience Plan, these concert associations typically launched short membership drives with the resulting subscriptions used to fund a series of visiting artists who, in turn, contracted with a few national management organizations. The income would usually sustain an annual series of 4‚Äì9 concerts balanced between prominent and emerging artists. The Organized-Audience Plan was sometimes dubbed as \\"a Carnegie Hall in every town.\\" Some prominent artists started their careers by performing on the concert association circuit.  History   Early history  The concept of the Organized-Audience Plan is often credited to Arthur Judson, at that time the manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra. In 1920 Judson experimented with the concert subscription model when he was asked by philanthropists Adolph Lewisohn and Minnie Guggenheimer to manage a concert series at City College Stadium which was geared toward creating affordable high quality music performances. In 1922, after being appointed as the manager of the New York Philharmonic, Judson began to lead efforts to enhance cooperation and shared resources between cultural organizations. In that year he also negotiated cooperation between the national organizations, one representing soloists and the second, local booking managers. Borrowing from the model of the Redpath Lyceum Bureau, Judson envisioned an organized national network of traveling artists who were efficiently booked to local venues. In 1927 Judson formed Community Concerts, Inc. which linked networks of performers and \\"organized audiences.\\" This idea was also borrowed from the community fund-raising models developed by Chicago's Harry P. Harrison, Dema Harshbarger, and Ward French.  Community Concerts, Inc.  Community Concerts, Inc. became the preeminent organizer of concerts in the United States. In its 1951‚Äì1952 season it supported approximately 1000 local concert associations. It provided assistance to the local associations in their membership drive efforts and also helped them plan concerts. It provided a menu of artists and repertory from which the local concert associations could select. The success of Community Concerts rested on finely attuning its programs to evolving audience tastes. In this 1951‚Äì1952 season the choices of composers were exclusively limited to those in the Romantic period with no representation of the Renaissance or Modern eras. Perhaps due to the impact of emerging technologies such as FM radio and high quality disc recording, by the 1957‚Äì58 season non-Romantic composers were represented in the sponsored programs.Goldin, pp. 39, 42 The competing promoters of the Organized-Audience Plan were Civic Concert Service Inc.Goldin, p. 37 and United Audience Service. In 1966 community organizations began to incorporate the Organized-Audience Plan independent of Community Concerts and its key competitors through publications such as Musical America. By 1977 Community Concerts membership had declined to approximately 700 local organizations. It closed during the 2002‚Äì2003 season.  International model  The Organized-Audience Plan model has spread abroad. In the 1950s there were 75 concert associations in Canada although the total now is reduced to approximately 15. Arguably the largest concert association in the world is Min-on Concert Association in Japan.  Criticisms  Although the Organized-Audience Plan achieved much success, it also met with controversy. Performers criticized their levels of remuneration, often 30% discounted from typical fees due to circuit travel costs and overhead, and complained about being blocked out by favored performers. The organizers were criticized for favoring certain types of performances over others. In 1939 Time magazine maligned the Organized- Audience Plan as \\"chain store music\\" and a \\"stooge set-up\\" in which small communities did not receive value for their fund-raising efforts.Doering, p. 170  Representative concert associations  The Organized-Audience Plan is initiated and managed at the community level. Frequently local concert associations are in small and medium cities and information about them can be found on their own self-promoting websites. For example, the Sheboygan Concert Association was founded in 1929 and celebrated its 89th season in the fall of 2017. The annual membership fee is $55 and entitles a subscriber to four concerts each year. JC Concerts in Jackson County Oregon is celebrating its 75th anniversary.http://jcconcerts.org/ In southern Delaware, the Seaford Concert Association was organized in 1949.

The plot focuses on when twenty-four-year-old Jae (Barton) is released from prison and returns to her childhood home in small-town Ridgecrest. Once reunited with her brother, (Davis), she joins him and some friends on a road trip to a music festival in Death Valley, resulting in them getting hopelessly lost and fighting to survive the elements. The film was written by Avis. It premiered in October, 2016 at The Crest Theater formerly known as Majestic Crest Theater.\\" The film was released by Invincible Pictures on February 28, 2017. Plot In Ridgecrest, California, twenty-four year old Jae, (Barton) is released from prison for murdering her mother 7 years prior. She is reunited with her older brother, Robin (Davis) at their childhood home and finds herself quickly wanting to escape the bad memories that still preside there. When Jae discovers that Robin will soon be leaving town to go to a desert music festival, 'Burn The Moon' in Death Valley with his girlfriend Rosemary (Zoli) and her friends Heather (Rosendorff) and Jasmine (Kelly Brannigan), she said she'll tag along. Once the group is on the road, the car breaks down in the middle of no where. A good samaritan, Clay (Busey) tows the car to the local mechanic, Archer (Sebastian Bach) who informs them, that the car will take at least 2 days to fix. While waiting at a local bar being served by Lizard (Gerry Bednob) some guys- Troy (Ford), Dax (Michael Milford) and Wade (Tyler Sellers) who stopped at the mechanic for gas and a drink, also on their way to the festival, offer to take the group along with them. Eventually they all head off together for the festival in the boys RV. As they head toward Death Valley they accidentally take a wrong turn in the darkness, and have no choice but to set up camp for the night. The group experiments with peyote, Jae and Troy have a semi-romantic tryst and Jasmine, unbeknownst to the others, accidentally kills the battery in the RV, while playing with the headlights when high. In the morning, they wake up to find that Rosemary is dead - assumed to have overdosed on the peyote or to have had some kind of bad reaction. The RV is now stranded, they have no cell reception and are completely lost. They have no choice but to take off on foot, leaving Rosemary's body behind in the RV. Things then continue to get progressively worse for the group. Over the course of the following 72 hours Wade gets bitten by a rattle snake and can no longer continue on with the group. Dax stays behind to look after Wade, until he eventually dies. Tensions start to rise between Robin and Troy until Robin decides that they will have a better chance of survival if he takes off alone in search of help. A huge sandstorm then hits the group which suffocates and kills Jasmine. Now alone, Dax - though having survived the sandstorm, sees no way out and jumps off a cliff face, committing suicide. Soon, Jae and Heather separate from Troy and eventually Heather dies from dehydration. In the end, a helicopter soon finds Robin and it is assumed that he is rescued. Jae finally finds a road and is picked up by a passing family. And at the very end of the film, after the credits have run, we see that Troy stumbles upon the 'Burn The Moon' festival, now over and done with.
