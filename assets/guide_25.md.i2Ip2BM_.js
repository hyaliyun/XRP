Glossip v. Gross Beginning in April 2015, Evans' credibility and qualifications as an expert witness became heavily criticized when the case of Glossip v. Gross went before the Supreme Court of the United States of America. At this time, it was revealed that over 150 pages of his report he provided in his testimony came directly from the consumer website Drugs.com. Many have also criticized Evans‚Äô opinion as an expert on midazolam due to his testimony regarding of the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines. Evans testified that: ‚ÄúMidazolam attaches to GABA receptors, inhibiting GABA‚Ä¶ that's what generates the clinical effect or the pharmacological effect from midazolam and all the other benzodiazepine drugs‚Äù and further stated ‚ÄúGABA receptors are responsible for anxiety disorders. So when you basically inhibit GABA, you basically begin to control those kind of symptoms‚Äù. These statements drew criticism as they describe the exact opposite of benzodiazepines, which actually work by enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor. By enhancing the effects of GABA, benzodiazepines use results in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects.

Gross, No. 14-7955, 576 U.S. (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held, 5‚Äì4, that lethal injections using midazolam to kill prisoners convicted of capital crimes do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court found that condemned prisoners can only challenge their method of execution after providing a known and available alternative method. Background On January 7, 1997, Justin Sneed beat Barry Van Treese to death with a baseball bat.Liliana Segura & Jordan Smith, What Happened in Room 102, The Intercept (July 9, 2015). The killing occurred at the Best Budget Inn in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where Van Tresse was the owner, Sneed was the maintenance-man, and Richard Glossip was the manager. In exchange for avoiding the death penalty, Sneed confessed and told police that Glossip had instructed him to commit the murder. Glossip insisted on his actual innocence and refused to accept a plea bargain. In July 1998, an Oklahoma jury convicted Glossip of the murder and sentenced him to death. In 2001, the unanimous Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals threw out that conviction, calling the case \\"extremely weak\\" and finding Glossip had received unconstitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.Glossip v. Oklahoma, 29 P.3d 597, 2001 O.K. C.R. 21 (Okla. Crim. App. 2001). In August 2004, a second Oklahoma jury convicted Glossip of the murder and sentenced him to death. Glossip complained that prosecutors had intimidated his defense attorney into resigning, but, in April 2007, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the death sentence, with two judges in the majority, one judge specially concurring, and two judges dissenting.Glossip v. Oklahoma, 157 P.3d 143, 2007 O.K. C.R. 12 (Okla. Crim. App. 2007). Glossip attracted the advocacy of Sister Helen Prejean, but failed to get the clemency board to consider letters from Sneed‚Äôs family, who believe Sneed is lying. After a three-justice plurality opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the use of the sedative sodium thiopental during lethal injections in Baze v. Rees (2008), disconcerted pharmaceutical companies began refusing to supply states with the drug.The Supreme Court, 2014 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 129 HARV. L. REV. 171 (2015). Oklahoma replaced the general anaesthetic with an untested off-label use of midazolam, keeping the drug‚Äôs origin secret.Jeffrey E. Stern, The Cruel and Unusual Execution of Clayton Lockett, The Atlantic (June 2015). Condemned prisoners Clayton Lockett and Charles Warner sued, and the state trial court found the secrecy law unconstitutional. However, pending an appeal by Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals refused to then stay the plaintiffs' imminent executions, so, on April 21, 2014, the Oklahoma Supreme Court did.Lockett v. Evans, 356 P.3d 58, 2014 O.K. 33 (Okla. 2014) (per curiam). Faced with conflicting court orders, Governor Mary Fallin decided to disobey the supreme court order, explaining the \\"attempted stay of execution is outside the constitutional authority of that body\\". The day after the Oklahoma House of Representatives drafted articles of impeachment against the supreme court justices, the court withdrew its stay of execution and reversed the trial court's holding against the state.Lockett v. Evans, 330 P.3d 488, 2014 O.K. 34 (Okla. 2014) (per curiam). On April 29, 2014, Oklahoma used midazolam in the execution of Clayton Lockett. After executioners had performed the lethal injection, Lockett began to struggle on the gurney, reportedly groaning \\"this shit is fucking with my mind\\" and \\"the drugs aren't working.\\" Lockett died forty-three minutes after the lethal injection. Oklahoma decided to delay the execution of Warner, who was scheduled to die later that night. After an investigation, Oklahoma elected to continue using midazolam in executions. On June 25, 2014, Warner, Glossip, and nineteen other Oklahoma death row inmates sued in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, alleging Oklahoma's use of midazolam violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. At the end of a three- day hearing, U.S. District Judge Stephen P. Friot orally denied the condemned prisoners' request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the use of midazolam in their executions.Warner v. Gross, On January 12, 2015, Tenth Circuit Judge Mary Beck Briscoe, joined by Neil Gorsuch and Scott Matheson Jr., affirmed.Warner v. Gross, Supreme Court of the United States On January 13, 2015, the condemned prisoners petitioned for a writ of certiorari and stays of their executions from the U.S. Supreme Court. The petitioners argued that the midazolam, intended to be used as sedative, would not render them unable to feel the pain of the other two drugs. On January 15, 2015, the Court denied lead petitioner Warner‚Äôs application for a stay of execution, over the written dissent of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan.Warner v. Gross, 135 S. Ct. 824 (2015) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting from denial of stays of execution). Oklahoma executed Warner later that day. However, on January 23, the Supreme Court decided to hear the case, staying the surviving petitioners' executions. The proceeding was then renamed, with Richard Glossip as lead petitioner. One hour of arguments were heard on April 29. At oral arguments, four conservative justices expressed impatience with obstructionist unavailability caused, Justice Scalia said, \\"by the abolitionists putting pressure on the companies that manufacture\\" the drugs. Justice Alito called this \\"guerrilla war against the death penalty\\", and Justice Kennedy insisted to have an answer from the petitioners on whether the court should take this element into account. Four liberal justices, conversely, harshly questioned the Oklahoma Solicitor General, with Justice Kagan describing the execution protocol as \\"burning alive, from the inside.\\" Opinion of the Court Justice Samuel Alito found the prisoners \\"failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth Amendment.\\" On June 29, 2015, the last day of the term, the Supreme Court ruled against the condemned prisoners in a 5‚Äì4 decision. At the opinion announcement, Justices Sotomayor and Breyer read aloud their dissents from the bench, while Scalia also read aloud a statement criticizing the previous week‚Äôs decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.\\"Glossip v. Gross.\\" Oyez. Chicago-Kent College of Law at Illinois Tech, n.d. Dec 13, 2016. Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of the Court, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas., 135 S. Ct. 2726 (2015). According to the Court, the Eighth Amendment requires prisoners to show there is a known and available alternative method of execution. The prisoners had failed to do this, the Court found, because the alternative drugs they proposed were unavailable to Oklahoma.. The Court explained that Hill v. McDonough (2006) did not apply.Glossip, 135 S. Ct. at 2738. Secondly, the Court found the Eighth Amendment requires prisoners to show the challenged method of execution poses a demonstrated risk of severe pain, emphasizing the burden of proof was on the prisoners, not the state. Although midazolam is not recommended or approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an anesthetic, the Court explained that a constitutionally adequate method of execution does not need to meet the medical standard of care.. The Court credited the testimony of Dr. Roswell Lee Evans, Oklahoma's expert witness, that there is \\"a virtual certainty\\" prisoners will feel no pain during lethal injection, rejecting the prisoners' \\"speculative evidence\\" of midazolam's ceiling effect. Finally, the Court found there was no merit to the prisoners' criticisms that Dr. Evans' report overused unreliable sources, such as drugs.com, and that it contained mathematical errors. Justice Scalia's concurrence Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concurred. Scalia attacked Breyer for offering \\"a white paper devoid of any meaningful legal argument.\\"135 S. Ct. at 2747 (Scalia, J., concurring). Mocking Breyer's use of statistics, Scalia wrote \\"if only Aristotle, Aquinas, and Hume knew that moral philosophy could be so neatly distilled into a pocket-sized, vade mecum 'system of metrics'\\".135 S. Ct. at 2748 (Scalia, J., concurring). Scalia then cited several studies concluding that the death penalty is more deterrent than life in jail.135 S. Ct. at 2749 (Scalia, J., concurring) citing Zimmerman, State Executions, Deterrence, and the Incidence of Murder, 7 J. Applied Econ. 163, 166 (2004); Dezhbakhsh, Rubin, & Shepherd, Does Capital Punishment Have a Deterrent Effect? New Evidence from Postmoratorium Panel Data, 5 Am. L. & Econ. Rev. 344 (2003) ; Sunstein & Vermeule, Is Capital Punishment Morally Required? Acts, Omissions, and Life-Life Tradeoffs, 58 Stan. L. Rev. 703, 713 (2005). Given Breyer's call to review precedent, Scalia adds his own call to counsel to brief whether Trop v. Dulles (1958) should be overruled.135 S. Ct. at 2749 (Scalia, J., concurring). Noting that the capital punishment debate in the United States had been deliberately left open by the Founders, Scalia concluded \\"by arrogating to himself the power to overturn that decision, Justice Breyer does not just reject the death penalty, he rejects the Enlightenment.\\"135 S. Ct. at 2750 (Scalia, J., concurring). Justice Thomas's concurrence Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, concurred. Thomas wrote that \\"the best solution is for the Court to stop making up Eighth Amendment claims in its ceaseless quest to end the death penalty through undemocratic means\\". Thomas wrote separately to clarify that he believes the Eighth Amendment only prohibits executions \\"deliberately designed to inflict pain.\\"135 S. Ct. at 2750 (Thomas, J., concurring). Calling Breyer's use of statistics \\"pseudoscientific\\", Thomas found one study's use of \\"depravity points\\" dehumanizing.135 S. Ct. at 2752 (Thomas, J., concurring) citing McCord, Lightning Still Strikes, 71 Brooklyn L. Rev. 797, 833‚Äì834 (2005). Thomas rejected Breyer's example of a double murderer arbitrarily receiving a lighter sentence than a murderer, citing news reports on WRAL-TV as explanation.135 S. Ct. at 2752 fn. 3 (Thomas, J., concurring) citing Charbonneau, Andre Edwards Sentenced to Life in Prison for 2001 Murder, WRAL, Mar. 26, 2004; Charbonneau, Jury Finds Andre Edwards Guilty of First-Degree Murder, WRAL, Mar. 23, 2004. Noting that, \\"in my decades on the Court, I have not seen a capital crime that could not be considered sufficiently 'blameworthy' to merit a death sentence\\", Thomas concluded by spending several pages graphically describing some of those crimes, including several rapes and several murders committed by the mentally retarded and by juveniles.135 S. Ct. at 2752-2755 (Thomas, J., concurring). Justice Breyer's dissent Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in dissent \\"I believe it highly likely that the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment.\\" Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, dissented. Explaining that the Constitution did not enshrine the standards of the Bloody Assizes or those found in Blackstone‚Äôs Commentaries on the Laws of England, Breyer believed that circumstances have radically changed since the death penalty was restored by the Court in Gregg v. Georgia (1976).135 S. Ct. at 2755 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 369‚Äì370 (1769) (listing mutilation and dismembering, among other punishments). Breyer gives four reasons he believed the death penalty is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment: 1) Serious unreliability: Breyer believed the wrongful execution of innocent men was cruel, listing Carlos DeLuna, Cameron Todd Willingham, Joe Arridy, and William Jackson Marion as examples.135 S. Ct. at 2756 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing e.g., Liebman, Fatal Injustice; Carlos DeLuna‚Äôs Execution Shows That a Faster, Cheaper Death Penalty is a Dangerous Idea, L. A. Times, June 1, 2012, p.

Breyer cited to research that indicates those convicted of capital crimes are more likely to be exonerated.135 S. Ct. at 2757 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing National Registry of Exonerations, Exonerations in the United States, 1989‚Äì2012, pp. 6‚Äì7 (2012); accord, Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), Innocence: List of Those Freed from Death Row.

Ct. at 2757 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing Stroud, Lead Prosecutor Apologizes for Role in Sending Man to Death Row, Shreveport Times, Mar. 27, 2015 Henry Lee McCollum (whom Antonin Scalia had previously cited to support his views on the death penalty),135 S.

Ct. at 2757 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing Blinder, Alabama Man on Death Row for Three Decades Is Freed as State‚Äôs Case Erodes, N. Y. Times, Apr. 4, 2014, p. A11. From this, Breyer concluded that the \\"intense community pressure\\" involved in capital cases increases the likelihood of convicting the wrong person.135 S. Ct. at 2758 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing Gross, Jacoby, Matheson, Montgomery, & Patil, Exonerations in the United States 1989 Through 2003, 95 J. Crim. L. & C. 523, 531‚Äì 533 (2005); ; see also B. Garrett, Convicting the Innocent: Where Criminal Prosecutions Go Wrong (2011) . Breyer was also concerned the search for a death-qualified jury might cause bias.135 S. Ct. at 2758 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing ; . Breyer further questioned the reliability of forensic testimony, citing problems with hair analysis.135 S.

Ct. at 2758 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing ; Risinger, Innocents Convicted: An Empirically Justified Factual Wrongful Conviction Rate, 97 J. Crim. L. & C. 761 (2007). Regardless of the actual innocence of the accused, Breyer cited research identifying prejudicial error in 68% of capital cases.135 S. Ct. at 2759 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing . Breyer then included editorials by former Virginia Attorney General Mark Earley rejecting the death penalty.135 S. Ct. at 2759 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing Earley, A Pink Cadillac, An IQ of 63, and A Fourteen-Year-Old from South Carolina: Why I Can No Longer Support the Death Penalty, 49 U. Rich. L. Rev. 811, 813 (2015); Earley, I Oversaw 36 Executions. Even Death Penalty Supporters Can Push for Change, Guardian, May 12, 2014. 2) Arbitrariness in application: Breyer believed it is cruel that the death penalty is imposed without reasonable consistency. To show this, he cited a study that attempted to measure the \\"egregiousness\\" of different crimes, finding that most death row inmates had not committed worse crimes than those sentenced to life in prison.135 S. Ct. at 2760 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing . Rather, Breyer believed the race and gender of the victim is much more important.135 S.

B5. 3) Excessive delays: Breyer believed it is cruel that there is a lengthy delay between sentencing and execution, noting that since 1960, the average delay grew from two years to 18.135 S. Ct. at 2764 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing ; Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), T. Snell, Capital Punishment, 2013‚ÄîStatistical Tables 14 (Table 10) (rev. Dec. 2014); DPIC, Execution List 2014. Firstly, Breyer believed longer delays are cruel, noting that solitary confinement had been criticized by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture.135 S. Ct. at 2765 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), A Death Before Dying: Solitary Confinement on Death Row 5 (July 2013); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Treatment of Prisoners 6 (3d ed. 2011); ; . Repeatedly issuing and then revoking death warrants is, according to Breyer, also cruel, noting that, before being exonerated, Willie Jerome Manning,135 S. Ct. at 2766 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing Robertson, With Hours to Go, Execution is Postponed, N. Y. Times, Apr. 8, 2015, p. A17; Nave, Why Does the State Still Want to Kill Willie Jerome Manning?

Edds, An Expendable Man 93 (2003) . had all come within days or hours of being executed, multiple times. In light of the death row phenomenon, Breyer did not find it surprising that many inmates volunteer to be executed.135 S. Ct. at 2766 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing ; . Breyer next noted the hostility foreign common law courts have shown to delays before executions in Pratt v A-G for Jamaica (1993), S v Makwanyane (1995), Soering v United Kingdom (1989), and United States v Burns (2001).135 S. Ct. at 2767 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Secondly, Breyer believed the only punishment rationales for the death penalty are deterrence and retributive justice. Breyer believed that the death penalty has no deterrent value.135 S. Ct. at 2767 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing Sorensen, Wrinkle, Brewer, & Marquart, Capital Punishment and Deterrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in Texas, 45 Crime & Delinquency 481 (1999) ; Bonner & Fessenden, Absence of Executions: A Special Report, States With No Death Penalty Share Lower Homicide Rates, N.

Rev. 791, 794 (2005); National Research Council, Deterrence and the Death Penalty 2 (D. Nagin & J. Pepper eds. 2012) . Likewise, Breyer believed that retribution is almost as well achieved by life in prison without parole.135 S. Ct. at 2769 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing Austin Sarat, Mercy on Trial: What It Means To Stop an Execution 130 (2005) ; ACLU, A Living Death: Life Without Parole for Nonviolent Offenses 11, and n. 10 (2013)). Breyer did not believe the Founders could have contemplated decades long delays when they wrote the Eighth Amendment.135 S. Ct. at 2769 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing P. Mackey, Hanging in the Balance: The Anti-Capital Punishment Movement in New York State, 1776‚Äì 1861, p. 17 (1982) ; Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments (1779), reprinted in The Complete Jefferson 90, 95 (S. Padover ed. 1943); 2 Papers of John Marshall 207‚Äì209 (C. Cullen & H. Johnson eds. 1977) (describing petition for commutation based in part on 5-month delay). Breyer highlighted that, after retiring from the Court, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. testified to Congress that he had changed his mind and now thought excessive delays made the death penalty unconstitutional.135 S. Ct. at 2764 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing Habeas Corpus Reform, Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 100th Cong., 1st and 2d Sess., 35 (1989 and 1990). 4) Most places within the United States have abandoned its use: Beside being cruel, Breyer believed the death penalty is also unusual because it has become rare. Noting that 41 states had the death penalty before the Court blocked it in 1972,135 S. Ct. at 2773 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing E. Mandery, A Wild Justice: The Death and Resurrection of Capital Punishment in America 145 (2013) . now there are 31, and only three, Texas, Missouri, and Florida, account for 80% of executions.135 S.

Ct. at 2777-80 (Breyer, J., dissenting) citing Ford, \\"The Death Penalty's Last Stand\\", The Atlantic, Apr. 21, 2015) Justice Sotomayor's dissent Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissent, in which Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Elena Kagan joined. Sotomayor stated that \\"under the Court's new rule, it would not matter whether the State intended to use midazolam, or instead to have petitioners drawn and quartered, slowly tortured to death, or actually burned at the stake: because petitioners failed to prove the availability of sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, the State could execute them using whatever means it designates.\\" Sotomayor attacked the credence the Court gave to Oklahoma's expert witness, writing \\"Dr. Evans' conclusions were entirely unsupported by any study or third-party source, contradicted by the extrinsic evidence proffered by petitioners, inconsistent with the scientific understanding of midazolam's properties, and apparently premised on basic logical errors.\\"135 S. Ct. at 2788 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) Sotomayor contended Dr. Evans' testimony that midazolam could \\"paralyze the brain\\" was directly refuted by peer-reviewed articles cited by the prisoners' expert witnesses.135 S. Ct. at 2784 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) citing ; ; . The majority erred, Sotomayor argued, by \\"imposing a wholly unprecedented obligation on the condemned inmate to identify an available means for his or her own execution.\\"135 S. Ct. at 2797 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) Calling the Court's holding \\"legally indefensible,\\" she argued the Court had failed to distinguish Hill v. McDonough (2006), and went on to criticize the Court for treating the plurality opinion in Baze v. Rees (2008) as precedent, noting that the Court was ignoring the concurring opinions necessary to achieve that judgment.135 S. Ct. at 2793 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Condemned prisoners should not be required to meet an additional burden of proof, in Sotomayor's view, simply because they face executions that \\"States hurriedly devise as they scramble to locate new and untested drugs.\\"135 S. Ct. at 2796 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) citing ; . Finally, Sotomayor anticipated that, due to the prevalence of botched executions,135 S. Ct. at 2796 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) citing A. Sarat, Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America‚Äôs Death Penalty, App. A, p. 177 (2014) . those condemned to die will increasingly choose execution by firing squad.135 S.

Brandon, The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History 39 (1999) . Subsequent developments Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt scheduled Glossip to die on September 30, 2015. However, Governor Mary Fallin ordered the sentence halted one hour before the execution, explaining that the state did not have in its possession the correct drugs. An Oklahoma grand jury report in May 2016 revealed that the state had obtained the wrong drugs during the execution of Charles Warner, lethally injecting him with potassium acetate instead of potassium chloride. Commentators complained that the Court majority had applied the preliminary injunction factors from Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council (2008) as four separate necessary elements, upsetting the balancing test and sliding scale approaches the circuit and district courts had been using to weigh the factors against each other.

This gene encodes a component of a mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate-dehydrogenase-complex-like protein involved in the degradation pathways of several amino acids, including lysine. Mutations in this gene are associated with 2-aminoadipic 2-oxoadipic aciduria and Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2Q.  Structure  The DHTKD1 gene encodes a protein that has 919 amino acids, and is one of two isoforms within the 2-oxoglutarate-dehydrogenase complex.  Function  DHTKD1 is part of an OGDHc-like supercomplex that is responsible for a crucial step in the degradation pathways of L-lysine, L-hydroxylysine, and L-tryptophan. Specifically, this enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA. There is a strong correlation between DHTKD1 expression levels and ATP production, which signifies that DHTKD1 plays a critical role in energy production in mitochondria. Moreover, suppression of DHTKD1 results in decreased levels of biogenesis and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the mitochondria. Globally, this impairs cell growth and enhances cell apoptosis.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the DHTKD1 gene are associated with alpha-aminoadipic and alpha-ketoadipic aciduria, an autosomal recessive inborn error of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan degradation. Only a handful of mutations have been observed in patients, including three missense mutations, two nonsense mutations, two splice donor mutations, one duplication, and one deletion and insertion. Two missense mutations are the most common cause of the deficiency. The clinical presentation of this disease in inconsistent. Mutations in this gene could also cause neurological abnormalities. Indeed, one form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease has been associated with DHTKD1, although the disease encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical neuropathies. Specifically, a hyterozygous nonsense mutation within the gene leads to decreased levels of DHTKD1 mRNA and proteins, and impaired ATP generation. This implicates this mutation as a causative agent for CMT-2 Disease.

The only member of the genus is Herpolitha limax, commonly known as the tongue, slipper, mole or striate boomerang coral. It is a free-living species and is native to reefs and lagoons in the Indo-Pacific region. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this coral as being of \\"least concern\\". Description Herpolitha limax has an elongated structure with somewhat rounded ends and a single, central, axial furrow that extends nearly from end to end. In the furrow are many conspicuous slit-like mouths and there are irregularly spaced, less-distinct mouths elsewhere. The primary septa are densely-toothed with fine spines and do not reach the edge of the colony. The costae are low with crowded, obtuse teeth. Sometimes the furrow is forked and forms a \\"Y\\" shape, a \\"T\\" shape, or even an \\"X\\" shape. This coral can grow to a length of or more and is usually some shade of grey, brown or greenish-brown. Distribution Herpolitha limax is native to the Indo-Pacific region, its range extending from East Africa and the Red Sea to Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the South Central Pacific. It is found on reef slopes and in lagoons, often in close proximity to Fungia spp. at depths down to about . Ecology Herpolitha limax is a colonial, free- living, zooxanthellate species of coral. Under stressful conditions it is susceptible to bleaching and corals appear white after expelling their symbionts. In a period of high water temperature in Thailand in June 2010, bleaching was common and 52% of the corals of this species were affected, along with many other species of mushroom coral. By the following February, they seemed to have recovered with no trace of thermal-induced bleaching being present, and the species composition being similar to that before the bleaching event. Status Herpolitha limax has a very wide range and is a common species in suitable habitats. The population trend is unknown but this coral is harvested for the reef aquarium trade, over 2,000 pieces being collected in 2005. Corals face threats associated with climate change but the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this species as being of \\"least concern\\".

It is thought that the area of Jericho was so named when the reverend John Wesley preached there in 1778 along with his pilgrimage through Bircle. Methodist Church The current Jericho Methodist church used to be called Moulding Methodist church. The original Moulding Methodist Church was founded in 1824, built at Higher Moulding, Bircle on a gift of land by Thomas Royds who farmed at Higher Moulding Farm. He was a Methodist Class Leader. The old church was made redundant in 1910 and relocated to the Elbut Lane site. In 2003 the old Moulding Methodist church on the Elbut Lane site was demolished and a chapel put there in its place and renamed Jericho Methodist church. During the rebuilding of the church the services were held at a pub called The Pack Horse Inn. The workhouse Long since gone is the old Jericho Workhouse, also known as Bury Union Workhouse. Nowadays a lot of the buildings are being used to form Fairfield General Hospital. Initially, the Bury Union continued to use the old township workhouses at Bury, Radcliffe, Heywood, Heap, Tottington Lower End, and Pilkington. Until 1852, children were accommodated at the Pilkington workhouse but from that date most were sent to the Manchester Union's industrial Schools at Swinton. The Radcliffe workhouse appears to have housed only male paupers, with Heap used for females. In 1850, Lord Derby refused to renew leases for the Bury, Heap and Pilkington workhouses which stood on his land, saying that the Guardians had \\"already spent as much money as would have built a union workhouse by paying extra salaries and not having a labour test.\\" The following year, the Poor Law Board proposed the building of a joint workhouse for Bury and the adjacent Union of Rochdale which was in a similar position. In 1852, the Bury Guardians borrowed ¬£6,000 and submitted plans for a workhouse to accommodate 400 inmates. It was also built with a separate Infirmary to hold up to 60 people. Work on the new buildings finally commenced in 1855 when a further ¬£8,000 was borrowed. The workhouse opened on January 21, 1857, and a year later the total cost for the scheme had grown to ¬£20,481. References External links * District of Jericho, Bury.

It is a listed historical monument since 1914. Chapelle Sainte-Marie-du-Menez-Hom Description The chapel of Sainte Marie du M√©nez-Hom at Plomodiern dates to the 16th century and stands in an enclos paroissial accessed through an 18th- century triumphal arch. This dates to 1739 and bears a statue of the blind Saint Herv√© with his guide Guic'haran. The enclos has a calvary comprising three crosses inscribed \\"Jehan Le Faloder Fabricque Feist Iceste Croix Faire MVCXLIIII\\". The bell tower porch is elaborate and was built in various stages between 1668 and 1773. It has a lanterned dome imitating that in Rome. The chapel's frontage gives onto the enclos' grass patch (plac√Ætre) and the building itself has used granite from the Logonna quarries for the southern section, a tougher granite from another area for the middle section and grey granite from Armorica for the surrounds to the doors and windows for the section built from 1570 to 1591. The baroque altarpieces Inside the chapel are three baroque altarpieces, that belonging to the master altar and those in the altars placed in the south and north of the chapel. . All three are dated to between 1703 and 1710 and have been listed as historic monuments since 24 December 1912. The master altar includes depictions of the Virgin Mary and the Holy Family (Sainte Famille) with Saint Joachim, Saint Joseph and Saint Anne. It was the work of Jean Le S√©ven and Jean C√©va√´r. The altarpiece in the south of the church celebrates Saint Peter, Saint James, Saint Andrew and Saint Paul whilst that in the north of the church depicts John the Baptist, Saint Louis, Saint Lawrence and Mary Magdalene.

Prior to the acquisition by Dillard's, Miller & Paine had three stores: two in Lincoln, the downtown flagship store and Gateway Mall with one in the Conestoga Mall in Grand Island, Nebraska. Miller & Paine was one of the first department stores in Lincoln. History Miller & Paine crestJ.E. Miller arrived in Lincoln from Pennsylvania in 1879 and in 1880 formed a partnership with Dr. Bartlett Paine to build a department store at 13th and O streets in downtown Lincoln. The building was built in 1898. The store was named Miller & Paine. In 1916, a new building was constructed on the site at 13th and O streets. The new building was designed by Berlinghof & Davis. In 1935, Miller & Paine became the first air-conditioned department store in Nebraska. Miller & Paine downtown store plaque Miller & Paine had a lunch counter in the basement and the Tea Room on the fifth floor in the flagship downtown store. Besides having the tearoom and lunch counter, they also had a bakery that was famous for its cinnamon rolls and crumb cookies and made their own candy to sell in their candy department. Miller & Paine imported cinnamon for its trademark cinnamon rolls, and sharp English cheddar cheese for its macaroni & cheese which was served crusted in its own individual serving bowl. The company also owned a farm near Emerald, Nebraska for its own supply of poultry, vegetables and eggs. In 1960, Miller & Paine opened a store in the newly developed Gateway Mall in Lincoln as an anchor store and in 1974, Miller & Paine opened a store in the Conestoga Mall in Grand Island. Miller & Paine sold their department stores in 1988 to Dillard's. The department stores ceased to use the name Miller & Paine re- branding the stores Dillard's. Shortly after the purchase, Dillard's closed the downtown store. The company Miller & Paine continues to operate today as Miller & Paine LLC which operates properties in Lincoln, Nebraska. The Berlinghof & Davis designed 13th and O street building is still extant and in use as offices. The trademarked Miller & Paine's cinnamon rolls which were once served in the department store's tearooms continue to be produced and sold by the Lincoln, Nebraska-based fast food restaurant Runza, which purchased the rights to the recipe in 2007.

Its sole known species, Thambotricha vates, is also known by the vernacular name wonder-haired prophet. It is endemic to New Zealand. This species is classified as \\"At Risk, Naturally Uncommon\\" by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy and etymology  T. vates was described by Edward Meyrick in 1922 from a specimen collected in Wellington by C. E. Clarke. George Hudson discussed and illustrated the species in his 1928 book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. The vernacular name of this species, \\"wonder-haired prophet\\", comes from a translation of its Latin name. The name is as a result of the male having very long hairs on its antenna.  Description  Meyrick described the species as follows:  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. Along with its type locality of Gollan's Valley in Wellington, this moth has also been collected at the Waipoua State Forest in Northland, in the Hakarimata Range near NgƒÅruawƒÅhia in the Waikato, in Taranaki, at Katikati in the Bay of Plenty, and near Aorere River in Nelson.  Biology and life cycle  Little is known of the biology of this species. T. vates are on the wing in March. This species appears not to attracted to light and has been caught by sweeping during daytime. Males of the species have been however been collected at night with the use of a pressure lamp.  Host species and habitat  The host species of the larvae of this moth is unknown. This species prefers native forest habitat.

Cultural aging  Cultural age is defined not only as a biological function nor a calendar mark, but also as all the meanings ascribed to categories of age across different places and times. It takes into account the diverse realities of aging including how it intersects with disability, gender, ethnicity, race, sexuality, class, etc. Researchers use narrative, performative, and materiality approaches to study age. For example, they analyze representations (e.g. autobiography, fiction), cultural scripts connected to life stages, as well as the ways people manage the physical changes that come with age.Aagje Swinnen & Cynthia Port, Aging, narrative, and performance: essays from the humanities, International Journal of Ageing and Later Life, 2012 7(2): 9 15, http://www.ep.liu.se/ej/ijal/2012/v7/i2/a01/ijal12v7i2a01.pdf.

The HKGA is primarily concerned with managing and overseeing the development of the sport of golf in Hong Kong. The HKGA provides guidance on the running of national championships, supports in the training of players, and also helps to finance a national team that represents Hong Kong in international competitions. The HKGA currently oversees 40 amateur tournaments annually, and is involved in the running of The Hong Kong Open. In addition, the HKGA also provides a centralised handicapping service for more than 15,000 subscribers that conforms to standards set by the USGA.  History  The establishment of the HKGA was predicated by a growing interest in the game of golf by the local population of Hong Kong. While golf had been in Hong Kong since around 1889, it was primarily the domain of the expatriate population. This developing interest in golf by locals created the need for an authoritative body to oversee the development of the sport. The HKGA was officially established in 1968 to co-ordinate efforts in growing the game of golf in Hong Kong. The organisation now acts as the governing body for amateur golf in Hong Kong.  Organisational structure  The HKGA has an Executive Committee formed through the membership of constituent golf clubs in Hong Kong. These clubs include the Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club, Discovery Bay Golf Club, The Hong Kong Golf Club, and Shek O Country Club. The Executive Committee includes a President, Vice-President, and Delegates from each of the four constituent clubs (as well as alternates from each club), an Honorary Secretary, and an Honorary Treasurer position. The positions of President and Vice-President are assigned annually through a rotating nomination by the four constituent clubs.  Hong Kong national teams  The HKGA has focused on building an internationally competitive national team through the financing of a developmental squad training programme. Currently, the HKGA has both a Men's and a Women‚Äôs National Team. Selection for these teams is based largely on tournament performance. The majority of national team players are ranked as top amateurs by the World Amateur Golf Rankings.  Initiatives  In addition to building and supporting a competitive national team, the HKGA is also involved in several other golf-focused initiatives. These initiatives have facilitated a growing interest in golf by the local population of Hong Kong. The HKGA now supports more than 1,600 junior golfers, and has over 100 individuals in its junior development programme. HSBC Junior Golf Programme An effort to provide Hong Kong's youth with a structured introduction to golf. The programme includes various initiatives, such as the HSBC Golf for Schools Programme, the HSBC Junior Development Programme, and the organisation of a match between top junior golfers from Hong Kong and China. =HSBC Golf for Schools Programme= This programme provides children between the ages of 6‚Äì12 with the opportunity to try golf at their local schools through an introductory training system called ShortGolf. The primary goal of the programme is to introduce golf to primary school students across Hong Kong, and to make the sport more accessible by providing children the opportunity to be exposed to golf. The programme also provides basic-level golf instruction to teachers so that they will be able to continue lessons independently. The program has seen great support. In 2014 at the Hong Kong Open, golfing professionals Robert-Jan Derksen and Liang Wen-Chong ran a seminar open to the public for all four-tournament days. The program concludes with on-course golf lessons, and the opportunity to earn an official HKGA handicap index. =HSBC Junior Development Programme= A talent- identification programme that tracks performance in HKGA-sanctioned junior tournaments. Top performers are offered the chance to become part of the HKGA Junior Squad for weekly coaching and talent development.  HKGA squads  The HKGA supports several different golfing squads with the primary mission of developing golfing talent in Hong Kong. These squads include: the Junior Squad, the Elite Junior Squad, the Men‚Äôs and Ladies‚Äô Squad, and the Hong Kong National Team. Invitations are extended based on performance at pre-defined local tournaments, performance at talent identification days, or on the recommendation of a golf professional. Minimum handicap requirements are also set. Junior Squad The entry-level HKGA squad that provides a structured instructional development programme for Hong Kong‚Äôs top junior golfers under the age of 18. The programme includes weekly training classes, on-course practice, tournament entry, and other development initiatives. Elite Junior Squad Top Junior Squad members are promoted to the Elite Junior Squad, which consists of golfers between the ages of 11 and 17. Men's and Ladies' squads Top Elite Junior Squad members are promoted to the HKGA Men‚Äôs and Ladies‚Äô squads once they have reached the age of 18. Hong Kong National Team The Hong Kong National Team consists of the top golfers in Hong Kong. There is no set age restriction, and eligibility is determined by performance. In addition to attending training sessions and participating in tournaments, National Squad members are expected to demonstrate their understanding of the game by attaining at least a Level 1 R&A; rule accreditation certification.  Tournaments  Currently, the HKGA runs 40 different amateur men's, women's, and junior golf tournaments annually. With the best-known of these being the Hong Kong Open Championship, a professional tournament co-sanctioned by the European and Asian Tours.

He killed one police officer and wounded two others before he was shot dead by other police officers. This was the first attack of its kind in Republika Srpska; attacks have occurred in the other entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the 1997 Mostar car bombing. Police forces of Republika Srpska launched a counter-terrorist operation codenamed Operation Ruben, with the declared aim of disrupting targets suspected of possessing firearms and involvement in radical Islamist circles. The move was heavily criticised by several Bosniak politicians because of the absence of coordination with the central government, with some suggesting that the operation was calculated to intimidate Bosniak refugees who had returned to live on what is today Republika Srpska's territory.  Shooting  Nerdin Ibriƒá, born in 1991 in Sapna near Zvornik, drove up to the Zvornik police station at around 19:00. When a sentry told him that he could not park in front of the station, Ibriƒá produced a rifle and opened fire at the officer. Several Bosnian-language news portals claimed that Ibriƒá had never shouted \\"Allahu akbar\\", citing another news portal which only reported that he had shouted profanities and threats. However, the following day, the same portal reported that Ibriƒá had initially yelled profanities and threats, but then began shouting Allahu akbar. Police officer Dragan ƒêuriƒá was struck by several bullets, and killed. Ibriƒá then went inside the station and continued shooting, wounding two other officers, after which he was killed by the police. The wounded policemen were quickly transferred to the local hospital. Police believe that the attack was well- planned in advance, as Ibriƒá knew exactly when the officers' shifts switched, and thus began his spree when the most policemen would be inside the station. The Minister of Interior of the Republika Srpska, Dragan Lukaƒç, said that the assailant was probably a Wahhabist and called the shooting an act of terrorism. The President of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, criticised police and security agencies at the state-level for not providing Bosnian Serb authorities with any useful information about potential terrorist plots prior to the attack. However, three days prior to the shooting, the Intelligence- Security Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina (OSA-OBA BiH) had informed police agencies in the country that there was a possibility of a terrorist attack as retribution for the recent arrests of several individuals of Bosniak origin in Australia who had planned terrorist attacks there.  Investigation  On the day of the shooting, the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) had arrested Ibriƒá's friend, Avdulah Hasanoviƒá. Hasanoviƒá was previously arrested by SIPA during the anti-terrorist action Operation Damascus, as he was suspected of being a member of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Hasanoviƒá was known to have participated in the Syrian Civil War in 2014. Another one of Ibriƒá's associates, Kasim Mehidiƒá, was arrested. After a two-day interrogation, both Hasanoviƒá and Mehidiƒá were handed over to the State Attorney of Bosnia and Herzegovina for further investigation. The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ordered that they be detained for one month under suspicion that they had recruited Ibriƒá for the attack. Soon after Ibriƒá's two friends were arrested, the police expanded its investigation to include other suspected radical Islamists, some of whom were also veterans of the Syrian Civil War. The police suspect that the village of Dubnica near Kalesija is one of the major gathering points of radical Islamists. Soon after the attack, Dodik met with Serbian President Tomislav Nikoliƒá and Prime Minister Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, asking them for intelligence and counter-terrorist assistance. On 6 May, the Republika Srpska launched Operation Ruben in order to root out suspected radical Islamists from the entity, detaining dozens of Muslim Bosniaks, as well as confiscating weapons, ammunition and propaganda material believed to be aimed to encourage Bosnian citizens to join fighters in Syria. The operation has been criticised by multiple Bosniak politicians, including Bakir Izetbegoviƒá who said that the Republika Srpska police had \\"crossed the line\\". The Mayor of Srebrenica said that the Serb police stormed the homes of Bosniaks who returned after the war and carried out arrests without explanation. He called it a \\"form of repression\\".  Possible motives  The Presidency and the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Government of Republika Srpska characterised the shooting as a terrorist attack. The United States Embassy to Bosnia and Herzegovina also referred to it as terrorism. The Office of the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina condemned the attack in a press release but did not describe it as a terrorist operation. The Sarajevo-based newspaper Dnevni avaz claimed the Bijeli Potok massacre that occurred on 1 June 1992 as a possible motive, when 668 Bosniaks of Zvornik, among whom was Ibriƒá's father Sejfo, were separated from their families and killed by the Army of Republika Srpska and police of Zvornik, with help of paramilitary units from Serbia. A radical Islamist magazine Saff claimed that ƒêuriƒá and Gajiƒá were linked to the Srebrenica massacres in 1995. According to Balkan Insight, their names were mentioned among more than 850 Serb soldiers and policemen on a 2004 Republika Srpska government report on the Srebrenica massacres. However, one of the officials who made the report explained that it just listed military and police personnel who were on duty in 1995 in the territory between Zvornik and Vi≈°egrad (including Srebrenica); the official said that \\"it is insane to claim that all of them committed war crimes\\".

As a child, he lived in the Aires Puros barrio (neighborhood) on Burges Avenue, near Fazenda Ipiranga Airport. He attended a local elementary school before moving up to the Mother Ana Lyceum. As a young adult, he went on to attend Dr. Eduardo Acevedo Institute in Montevideo, studying advocacy, where he went on the achieve a Baccalaureate in Law.  Early years  Like many children, he was introduced to the wonderful stories of literature at an early age, as his parents and grandparents read to him frequently, passing on their love of literature to young Hector. And as he grew into his teen years, the world of fiction provided a much-needed escape for Rosales. Through literature, he was able to experience the joys and happiness of life which the political turmoil in Uruguay, at that time, prevented him and others from enjoying. The world around him, the real world, was filled with misery, unhappiness and despair as a result of violent tactics employed by the ruling political party that had recently overthrown Uruguay‚Äôs former democratic government. On June 27, 1973, when Rosales was just fifteen years old, a military coup established itself as the new form of government in Uruguay. The suffocating, repressive atmosphere of economic, political and social decline that followed that existed at the time of military rule, however, greatly influenced Rosales‚Äôs writings. In 1976, at eighteen years of age, he wrote his first short stories and poems, which express the sorrow and despair he felt about the political situation. These early works were not made public, but were simply passed around among friends and relatives to be read. Rosales would comment years later that these first writings had little aesthetic value and were written only as an outlet for his adolescent despair.  Career  Between 1977-1978, Rosales wrote his first two books of poetry, Visions and Agonies and Night Mirrors. In January 1979, he made the decision to leave the turmoil of Montevideo behind him, and move to Ruby, Spain., near Barcelona. He became a Spanish national in 1980 and continued to stay busy with various writing and media projects. He wrote numerous journal articles, collaborated on literary works with other writers, established the poets group known as ‚ÄúGroup Now,‚Äù was involved in publishing, organized discussions, workshops, recitals, worked in graphic design, radio, and immersed himself in studying the works of Spanish poets. In 1992, he moved to Barcelona and from 1993-1995 he ran a language school there. From November 1994-September 1996, he edited the folios for The Leaves of the Flood, an anthology of Latin American and Spanish poets. From 2000-2006, he was a member of the governing body of the English Library. He currently manages a group of schools in the Catalan capital of Barcelona. Rosales credits Juan Carlos Onetti (1909-1994), short story writer and novelist with having the greatest influence on its own writings. Onetti was imprisoned in 1974 for disseminating a short story by Nelson Marra (‚ÄúThe Bodyguard‚Äù) whose subject matter offended the military dictatorship in Uruguay. The works of Hector Rosales have been translated into English, Italian, German, Polish, Catalan and Galician. Rosales continues to write, at his leisure, away from the public and media splendor. He also continues to promote the works of his fellow Uruguayan writers as well as continuing on with his travels, all things which he says are in a constant battle with his ‚Äúunique and disproportionate enemy:time.‚Äù  Works  ;Poetry *Visions and agonies (Barcelona, 1979, 2nd ed. revised and expanded, New Jersey, 2000) *Mirrors at night (Madrid, 1981) *Folder 1 (Barcelona, 1982) *Dende eigui / booklet (Pontevedra, 1983) *Spectra (Gijon, 1983) *Desvuelo (1st ed.

Research topic: the comparative religious history of pre-Christian times.  Early life to World War II  William Juhasz came from a family of industrialists, financiers and land owners. Many members of this family were also involved in the world of arts and letters, among whom the most important and prominent was the composer Franz Schrecker. Juhasz's early interests and eventual career were a departure from his immediate family's involvement in finance and industry. Influenced by some of his secondary school teachers who were recognized leading intellectuals as well as some of his classmates and school mates who became leading intellectuals of the period between the two World Wars. He went on to become a leading intellectual of that period. Secondary education was at the Mark√≥ Street Gymnasium in Budapest. His home room teacher, Marcell Benedek, as well as his class and school mates were formative influences in his life and work. Among his youthful friends were some of the leading lights of the Hungarian intelligentsia between the Wars; including: Bence Szabolcsi, Gy√∂rgy S√°rk√∂zi, M√°rta S√°rk√∂zi, M√°rta V√°g√≥, Zolt√°n Horv√°t, and the monks L√°szl√≥ and D√©nes Szed≈ë. Like many in his milieu, William came from a Jewish family, and, again, like many in his milieu he became a convert to Roman Catholicism. Two of his closest friends, and associates, the Szed≈ë brothers, also from Jewish families, became cloistered Carthusian monks in Italy. His conversion was a milestone in his personal and professional development. Mary Christianus, his future wife, was yet another major influence on his spiritual and professional development. Having decided not to follow the family line of finance and industry, he embarked upon studies at the University with the aim of becoming a scholar. He dropped out after the second year and did not receive a degree, and embarked upon an intellectual career not based on higher educational attainments. It was shortly after abandoning his university studies that he married Mary Christianus. Mary's background and educational career was quite different from his own although they were members of the same emerging intellectual elite between the wars. Her family background was more in the trades and manufacturing than in finance and industry. She never attended classical academic secondary school. Her family was not primarily Jewish and she had been raised Roman Catholic. William and Mary met in their early 20s in the turmoil of post-World War I Budapest, as it found itself a capital of a minor European country after being a co-capital of one of the world's major powers. Mary Juhasz, was a lifelong collaborator both in the thought process as well as the actual writing of his published works. As is not uncommon, she did not receive formal recognition as a collaborator. Nonetheless there was nothing that he published that he did not or, more accurately, they did not discuss in depth and come to consensus on. One of the members of his circle, Bence Szabolcsi's father-in-law Gy≈ëz≈ë Andor, who was the proprietor of an eponymous respected publishing house, provided William with the opportunity to edit several encyclopedias as well as the writing of numerous entries in these. The entries in Encyclopedia of the Theater (Szin√©szeti lexikon) dealing with the ancient history of dance and drama in which he developed his ideas regarding symbolism in performance art, received very favorable notice not merely in Hungary but elsewhere in the world as well. With this, his career as a non-university educated intellectual was under way. William Juhasz was passionate for many different branches of the humanities, the social sciences and the arts; he read widely and his career spanned an unusually wide swath of human learning and performance. For example, as a young man he participated in the archaeological work of N√°ndor Fettich, he wrote a science fiction novel, he wrote poetry (unpublished), he did editorial work for several publishers. In effect he became something of a Renaissance man, a polyhistor, someone who can synthesize and distill important information and lines of thought with originality and purpose. His work in comparative religious history encompasses original research, and in some ways he was extraordinarily proud of having been able to do that in addition to his other labors. During the 1937-1938 period as the anti-intellectual, anti-Semitic, and anti-democratic climate in Europe increasingly darkens the landscape, William and Mary give serious consideration to emigration to Canada, along with some of their close circle. In fact, they do not emigrate at this time and, by 1939, the window of opportunity for emigration had closed. His encyclopedic knowledge made him a natural choice for editing encyclopedias (or writing entries in them); his knowledge of languages and his fine Hungarian style made him a natural choice as translator from German and English to Hungarian; he wrote for periodicals, newspapers and reviews on many subjects of interest to him and he began a career of publishing works on history, travel, and cultural history in this period. By the time he was 40 years old he was a known quantity with a known readership in Hungary, and his name was to some measure a guarantee of quality and of success. Some of the more important work from this period are: *Heroes, scientists, men: the last seventy years of history 1860-1930 *The world's peoples and cultures,United States of America *The prince vol II. R√°k√≥czi Ferencz  1939-1945 World War II  1939 was a fateful year. William was forty. He had become an established name in Hungarian letters by the fourth decade of his life‚Äîand was ready to really take flight on the basis of what he had already accomplished. But war broke out and he was in a difficult, dangerous, and awkward position. At the height of the promise of his career his line of retreat from Hungary had been cut off by the outbreak of the war; and his Jewish background, his anti-Nazi politics and his progressive views made him an ever increasing target of personal or objective opponents. The process of excluding Jews and progressive voices from public life had begun. These developments were also catastrophic to the entire family‚Äîand of course, William being a family man‚Äîthis fed back into his own personal and professional behavior. As a frosting on the cupcake, in 1939 he was called up for military service‚Äîironically he was called for service in the First Hussar Regiment, an elite regiment of consummate cavalry men. This awkward intellectual, who had never sat on a horse in his entire life, was assigned the task of guarding Polish prisoners of war. In practice, the powers that be closed their eyes or looked the other way as Poles drifted out of Hungary, and as such his assignment became redundant. He was not called up again until 1944. He was forced by the ascendancy of National Socialism (Nazism), as well as the progress of the war, to lay aside his open struggles for peace, freedom, and democracy. As the lead political editor of the newspaper Az √öjs√°g, he nevertheless attempted to provide an objective view for its readers. The Hungary of 1939 through late 1944 was not the Germany of that period. It could be likened perhaps to Italy or Vichy France‚Äîawkwardly allied with the Germans. As such, the latitude for an intellectual was much wider than it would have been in Germany during this period. William understood and exploited this situation with masterful diplomacy. He was one of the leading members of the Szent Kereszt Egyes√ºlet (Holy Cross Society) which was founded for the protection of Catholics who would be effected by the Jewish laws. His highly successful work Nyersanyagh√°bor√∫ (War for natural resources) was written to make it crystal clear that the Axis powers were in no position to prevail in the war. Nagy H√≥dit√≥k (Great conquerors) was written to demonstrate that history proves that dictators of the ilk of Hitler inevitably sow the seeds of their own destruction. As the managing editor of the Dante publishing house, he supported progressive writers and published progressive books. Megv√°lt√°s Fel√© (Towards Redemption) deals with comparative religious history from the perspective of humankind's universal and timeless yearning for redemption. This was his most clearly original research scholarly work, its thrust is in line with what could be seen as a broadly-speaking Abrahamic view of human fate and the human condition, and its implicit condemnation of Nazism is transparent although unstated. The German occupation of Hungary in 1944 put an end to these efforts. He was called up to be in a work camp. During these months, which included the Sz√°lasi Arrow Cross regime, Mary Juhasz performed heroic service, at the risk of her own life, to protect and shelter the persecuted. She had such courage and presence of mind that she could face down armed uniformed adversaries‚Äîand did. William was able to flee from the work camp and spent the rest of the war in the attic of the Motherhouse of the Sisters of Social Service.  From 1945-1948 in Hungary  In certain respects, it was a beaten family that emerged from the war‚Äîthe horrors of the German occupation, not to mention the Arrow Cross regime, were a profound and deep crisis and catastrophe for the family. Among William's closest friends Gy√∂rgy S√°rk√∂zi, Antal Szerb, J√≥zsef Kepes, and Gy√∂rgy Kecskem√©ti, had fallen victims to the holocaust and Bence Szabolcsi's only child had been murdered. Nonetheless, the victory of the allies provided an opportunity for hope and optimism. In the beginning, William believed he could be the participant in the forging of a new and democratic nation. He accepted a post as the political editor of the daily Szabad Sz√≥ (Free Speech) and with S√°ndor S√≠k he edited the restarted prestigious Catholic intellectual monthly review Vigilia. He was professor at the University of Szeged, which had belatedly bestowed a doctorate on him (in the absence of an undergraduate degree) taking Towards Redemption (Megv√°lt√°s Fel√©) as his doctoral dissertation. He was co-editor of the equally prestigious literary weekly √öj Id≈ëk (New Times). He provided radio commentary on foreign affairs and lectured frequently on a wide range of topics. He found himself at the vanguard of the post-Nazi progressive Catholic intelligentsia and was deeply involved in the formation of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Party (which modeled itself on its Western European counterparts) however, in the absence of direct support from the Allies, as the understanding of the Great Powers was that Hungary would be within the Soviet sphere of influence (although of course that had not been made plain to the Hungarians themselves). He resumed his publishing activities (although with increasing pressure to find at least a neutral tone towards the emerging Sovietization of the Hungarian government) and in a short period of time edited the first Hungarian encyclopedia after the War R√©vai K√©tk√∂tetes Lexikona, and he wrote books on such diverse subjects as for example the meaning and importance of the Atomic Age (Az atomkorszak √∫j vil√°ga) and edited the first post-war world atlas in Hungary‚Äîand with the aid of his eldest son Francis, the Hungarian Export Catalog. However, with the start of the R√°kosi Communist regime, (1945-1949) he became more and more a member of the opposition, or more accurately went into opposition. This of course, given the nature of the regime, made his work difficult and even risky. As a professor of the Catholic Free University he spoke out against the regime forcefully and frankly nevertheless. During the fall of 1948 the regime began a campaign against Cardinal J√≥zsef Mindszenty, the Prince Primate of Hungary and Archbishop of Esztergom. Mindszenty was made the symbol of the futility of resistance to the regime. As part and parcel of this campaign, all public figures who were associated with him or with a religious viewpoint became suspect and objects of attention by the authorities. William Juhasz was kept under visible surveillance. On at least one occasion, when he picked up the telephone, the Secret Police answered.  Emigration  Peaceful resistance and coexistence became futile as the Hungarian regime stepped up its efforts to eliminate opposition. His view was that he could carry out his work more effectively as a political exile. Steven Koczak, an American diplomat stationed in Budapest, provided assistance such that he was able to flee to Vienna. Hence he proceeded to Salzburg. His hotel room was like a press room: he was in touch with journalists beyond count, among whom we can mention Simon Bourgin, who represented Time, and George Weller, who represented the Chicago Daily News. He acted as a valuable source for Western journalists, Americans in particular, for current events in Hungary. In 1950 he was put in charge of the Vatican Holy Year exhibition's section that dealt with the Church behind the Iron Curtain and moved his family to Italy. His work in this period included participation in the Marian Conference where he presented an original paper \\"Amictae sole\\" fundamenta etimologica et historica mission which argues that the power of the image of Mary as the \\"woman clothed in the Sun\\" was the motive force for the successful suppression of the bogomil heresy by Hungary. His stay in Italy saw him as co-editor of Katolikus Szemle (Catholic Review). At the end of the Holy Year he emigrated to the United States. From that point on, his main work was with the National Committee for a Free Europe. He worked as an editor in their journalism and publishing sector. He was also a planning officer of the International Advisory Board to the National Committee for a Free Europe and he was the force behind the distribution of Western scientific and scholarly books to scholars behind the Iron Curtain under cover of their being review copies. It was during this period that he authored a series of monographs and book chapters which may be best understood as counter propaganda directed against the Soviet-dominated regime in Hungary. These works reveal a hope and, even conviction, that the Bolshevik experiment in Hungary was doomed and would be replaced by a return to the proper order of things within the framework of Catholic liberal humanism of Western Civilization that Hungary had embraced for almost one thousand years. A brief summary of some of these works follows. The Development of Catholicism in Hungary in Modern Times In this sweeping, 60 page survey of the history of Catholicism in Hungary the author covers almost 1000 years in a masterful yet unavoidably dizzying way. Written as a Hungarian √©migr√©, this monograph is clearly aimed at exposing the brutal, unjust and inhumane attack on the Catholic Church by the Soviet-led forces in Hungary. This is done less by dwelling on the specific instances of oppression, such as Cardinal Mindszenty, which were already well-documented elsewhere. Rather, this piece seeks to inform the reader that the Church in Hungary holds a unique place as a moral force for social reform which clearly cannot be matched by a morally bankrupt Bolshevism. The argument is made by providing historical context and citing specific examples rather than ideological debate. In terms of the examples cited, the author enumerates a litany of heroic Hungarian men and women of the Church. One man is particularly singled out for attention as a sort of exemplar, Ottokar Prohaszka, who is quoted extensively and of whom the author states: \\"the first true genius since the Counter Reformation, of Hungarian Catholic literature and theology, and the advocate of a radical solution, in a Christ-like spirit, of the social problems. Spiritualist, creative writer, and social reformer; these basic elements of his personality were united in perfect harmony.\\" The historical context is perhaps best summed up in these words of the author: \\"‚Ä¶ the curious recurring paradox of the history of Catholicism by which persecution and oppression proved beneficial to the deepening and purification of religious life.\\" Blueprint for a Red Generation Written in 1952, at the height of the Cold War, this critique draws back the iron curtain from the author's native post-war Hungary for an in-depth critique of the educational methods and goals of the Soviet socialist system as applied in Hungary. As a clear antithesis to the deceptive propaganda behind the Iron Curtain, the author presents a well-researched, fact based analysis which recognizes that the Soviet engineered education reforms were very successful at achieving their goals. These achievements are cited with specific data and include historically high enrollment and graduation rates and almost complete elimination of illiteracy. The author reminds us that the stated goal of this is to serve the State in building its new Industrial utopia with ever increasing production efficiency. As argued by Juhasz, these goals come at the expense of human freedom, breakdown of the family, suppression of national identity, and elimination of religious practice. Not only are the goals anathema to the author's view of humanity and culture, but the methods to achieve them are a testament to their malevolence including the omnipresence of political commissars (thought police), and the brutal attacks on those who showed less than total enthusiasm for the new order. \\"The narrow specialization, the complete ideological control, the autocratic domination, the Russification, the cultural, technological, and historical distortions to match Russian patterns ‚Ä¶ The constant anti-democratic propaganda and above all the iron curtain against free expression and exclusion of all true Western knowledge and history‚Ä¶\\" The devil is in the details and the author cites numerous examples of the tyranny that the Hungarian people were subjected to in their education system at this time. Mother of the Church of Silence Explores the deep and pervasive devotion to Mary, Mother of God, by Hungarians throughout its history and how this devotion has sustained the faith of the people in spite of the suppression of the Church and religious practice in the Cold War. Bartok's Years in America Based on a series of anonymous interviews with close friends and acquaintances of Bartok during his time in America. The theme is the high emotional cost of leaving one's native land to uphold moral convictions.  Post 1956  In the period following the 1956 Uprising in Hungary, there is a paucity of published writings by Dr. Juhasz, and certainly nothing that would suggest a hope for a counter-revolution in Hungary or, even critiques of the post-1949 Hungarian regime. However, Dr. Juhasz played a key role in a covert, CIA-funded book distribution program that was revealed in extensive detail in a 2013 book Hot Books in the Cold War. The author, Alfred Reisch, was Juhasz's assistant from 1956 until 1967 and his successor in the book distribution program until its demise at the end of the Cold War in 1991. According to Reisch, the book program had as its primary objective to maintain ties to the intellectual and political elite in Eastern Europe who were otherwise deprived of Western publications due to severe censorship. The publications covered a broad range of recognized literary works as well as specialized scholarly and scientific articles. In 1959 he began lecturing on Hungarian Cultural History at Columbia University (New York) and from 1964 on he was a well-respected teacher of the Sz√©ch√©nyi Literary Circle in New York. In 1967 he suffered a brain embolism. At first he appeared to recover. However shortly thereafter there was one medical incident after another. He died September 29, 1967 in New York.

Biography Sanders was born at Kinghorn, Fife, in 1774, and educated at Edinburgh. There he was apprenticed to a coach-painter named Smeaton, and afterwards practised as a miniature-painter and drawing-master, and designer of book illustrations. At that period he executed a panorama of Edinburgh taken from the guardship in Leith Roads. Before 1807 Sanders came to London, where, after working as a miniaturist for a few years, he established himself as a painter of life-sized portraits in oil. Though of limited abilities, he was for a time a very fashionable artist, and obtained high prices, as much as 800l. being paid for his portrait of Lord Londonderry. He usually represented his male sitters in fancy dress. His portraits of the Dukes of Buckingham, Devonshire, and Rutland, Lord Dover, Lord Falmouth, Jane Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, Mr. W. Cavendish, and Sir W. Forbes, were well engraved by J. Burnet, C. Turner, H. Meyer, and others. Sanders painted several portraits of Lord Byron; one, dated 1807, was engraved whole-length by E. Finden as a frontispiece to his \\"Works,\\" 1832, and half-length for Finden's \\"Illustrations to Lord Byron's Works,\\" 1834; another, representing the poet standing by his boat, of which a plate by W. Finden was published in 1831, is well known. He also painted a miniature of Byron for his sister, Mrs. Leigh, which was engraved for the \\"Works,\\" but cancelled at Byron's request. Sanders exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1834 only, sending then five portraits, which were severely criticised at the time. He frequently visited the continent, and made watercolour copies of celebrated pictures by Dutch and Flemish masters; twenty-three of these are now in the National Gallery of Scotland. He died at Allsop Terrace, New Road, London, on 26 March 1846. George Sanders trained and introduced his niece Christina Robertson to a customer basis for her miniatures. She was to become a painter at the Russian court.V.

Military career Upon William of Orange's invasion of England, Barrymore came out for William against James II and was subsequently appointed lieutenant-colonel in William's army on 31 December 1688. After the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1702 he purchased for 1,400 guineas the 13th Regiment of Foot from Sir John Jacob, 3rd Baronet (his brother-in-law) and became Colonel of the Regiment. He was in turn appointed brigadier-general (c. 1707), major- general (1709) and lieutenant-general (1711). He served under Lord Galway and was captured after the Battle of Almansa in 1707. Upon the accession of the first Hanoverian monarch George I and his proscription of the Tories in 1715, Barrymore was forced to sell his regiment. Political career Barrymore took up his seat in the Irish House of Lords in 1704 and was elected Tory MP for Stockbridge for the British House of Commons in the Tory landslide of 1710. He lost his seat to the famous Whig writer Sir Richard Steele in 1713 but regained it upon appeal. In 1715 he was elected MP for Wigan, which he held until 1747 apart from a break during 1727‚Äì34. In 1714 he was appointed to the Irish Privy Council. Jacobitism Barrymore embraced the Pretender's cause late in life. In 1740 he conspired with English Tories for a Stuart restoration aided by a French invasion and visited Cardinal Fleury to persuade him to support it. In 1743 Louis XV of France's master of horse, James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, travelled to London to meet Barrymore and other Tory peers to conspire to French invasion. Barrymore was to be part of Charles Edward Stuart's council of regency should he successfully oust the Hanoverians. In February 1744 the British government discovered from a spy in their service in France the English members of the conspiracy and Barrymore was arrested. After the collapse of the Jacobite rising of 1745 the government decided not to prosecute Barrymore.The History of Parliament, The Tories Personal life He married,Cokayne, G.E.; Vicary Gibbs, H.A.

Reviewing the first novel, Terms of Enlistment, io9 described it as sticking close to the conventions of the genre, focusing on \\"guns, acronyms, hard-ass drill sergeants, explosions and battles on alien worlds\\". The reviewer considered the second novel, Lines of Departure, to be an improvement in that it reflected a critical outlook towards powerful, centralized government that was often absent in leading works of the genre such as Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers. Lines of Departure was nominated for the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Novel on a slate organized by the \\"Sad Puppies\\", a group of \\"right-leaning science fiction writers.\\" In reaction to this, Kloos withdrew the novel from consideration for the award.

Fuentes helped organize first annual Dia de los Muertos procession in Lubbock in the late 1990s. Early life and education Fuentes was born in San Angelo, Texas. She was raised in Odessa, Texas. She began her study of art at Odessa College. She received her BFA and MFA at North Texas State University. During her time in New Mexico, Fuentes attended and trained at the Tamarind Institute. Fuentes designed her own home, basing it on native adobe architecture.  Career and Art  Fuentes taught art in Albuquerque, New Mexico for about 15 years. Over the years, she has taught in Texas Public Schools, the Waco Art Center and at the University of Albuquerque and the University of New Mexico. Fuentes now resides in Lubbock, TX and works at Texas Tech University's School of Art as a professor of painting in the studio art department. Since 2014, Fuentes has been collaborating with Eric Bruning, an associate professor of atmospheric science at Texas Tech, on a five year interdisciplinary initiative on severe weather funded by a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation.

For many years, Fuentes limited her palette to black and white. Her art, over a 30-year period, has explored the boundaries of both abstract and representational art. Deconstructing everyday objects has also become an important part of her work. Fuentes herself describes her work as \\"non- objective or abstract,\\" but also as \\"biographies and self-portraits.\\" She sees her art as revealing who she is and how she has developed and grown as a person.

In the meantime, Reto Hunkeler (Mathias Gn√§dinger), Kommiss√§r (inspector) of the Basel Police, reflects on his impending retirement ‚Äì in fact his boss, (prosecuting attorney) Staatsanwalt Suter, has already written him off and sends Hunkeler to Alsace to research a study about youth crime, but he prefers to spend his time at the local spa. When Hunkeler returns to Basel, a colleague tells him about the murder case that his partner is investigating: Aische Aydin, a young woman of Turkish origin, is found slain in her apartment in Basel where she lived the past five years. Her husband Ali Aydin (Baris Eren) is suspected, but he keeps silent, and Hunkeler's ambitious young colleague Mad√∂rin (Giles Tschudi) leads the investigations and arrests the victim‚Äôs husband. Later, Aydin even attempts suicide when alleged staff of the Turkish consulate tried to get further information. Hunkeler is assailed by doubts, and finds an amulet in the apartment ‚Äì representing a couple in a boat ‚Äì that attracts his attention. Hunkeler meets a colleague in a bar that recommends him to ask a narc of the drug police in Basel, and Fredy later 'assists' Hunkeler to complete his investigations. Hunkeler is looking for further hints, surveys Theo Ruf who gave a job as charwoman to Aische, and a neighbor of the Aydin's tells Hunkeler that she observed a Roma girl escaping the house. Hunkeler investigates the strange amulet in the neighbouring Alsace in France in private, as he assumes that Mad√∂rin is wrong, where Hunkeler meets Roma families to find the girl. Shortly afterwards, the heroin addict Theo is found murdered, Hunkeler is sandbagged by the murder, but the police assumes a drug delict as there is a greater amount of heroin. Acquaintances of Aydin confirm that the amulet belonged to Aische, but the forensic scientist Anne de Ville (Emanuela von Frankenberg) remarks that there's no forensic hint that Aische was wearing an amulet, but she was beaten, and Theo even was tortured by his murder. Aydin remains hospitalized, but now is also associated by the police with drug trafficking: Mad√∂rin investigates the drug case and homicide, and Hunkeler now officially investigates the murder of Aische. Advised by his lawyer Sp√§lti who also assisted Aische to bring their children to Switzerland, Ali still keeps silent. Attorney Sp√§lti introduces Hunkeler the Turkish diaspora in Kleinbasel, and informs Hunkeler about the Basel drug scene, doubting that the police will try to solve the homicide, but rather will concentrate their effort to solve the 'drug' case. Theo's alleged killers continue to search for the missing material. Hunkeler contacts again the narc Fredy to get further information, and once again, travels to Alsace to find the supposed witness, the Roma girl. Hunkeler finds the girl as she breaks a car at a train station in Alsace: Zarah (Sophie Scholz) lost the amulet and confirms that she observed the murder from a hiding place. Hunkeler brings Zarah for a comparison to Basel, wins her to do so by entertaining Zarah to dinner, and they spend a day in his favourite spa. But first the young Roma woman has to be surveyed by the youth advocate, and Hunkeler's boss is cheesed with him because he kidnapped Zarah from France to Switzerland. The youth advocate interrogates Zarah as a witness, but claims involuntary commitment to the underage Roma girl as she committed other crime delicts in Basel. Hunkeler's friend was attacked by two alleged employees of the Turkish consulate, but in fact members of the drug mafia, who later even menace Hunkeler who guests his friend and Zarah. The next day, the two Turkish gangsters have been arrested, but on occasion of the identification parade, Zarah identifies Ali's lawyer, attorney Sp√§lti, and tells what she saw that evening when Aische was killed. Now, Ali is talking about: He had been forced by the mobsters to courier services, but his wife had hidden the goods. Fearing reprisals, he had been reluctant to satisfy the desire of his wife Aische, and to bring their children to Switzerland. Sp√§lti admits to have slain Aische in the dispute. She had sought his advice, because she necessarily wanted to have their children in Switzerland. Aische liked Sp√§lti, but he wanted more from her then friendship. After Sp√§lti had learned a lot about the background, he tried to blackmail Aische. As she still rejected him, he went berserk and thereby became the killer. Hunkeler sends Zarah back to France to prevent that she is arrested for the minor delicts in Basel. At the end, Hunkeler meets again Anne de Ville.  Title  The title of the film derives from the German term meaning Hunkeler and the couple in the boat, and refers to the amulet that Hunkeler found.  Background  The television film is the first episode of six films about Kommiss√§r Hunkeler starring Mathias Gn√§dinger, which were produced for the Swiss television SF DRS between 2004 and 2012 (Hunkeler und die Augen des √ñdipus). The Swiss German language movie bases on the 1999 novel Das Paar im Kahn by Hansj√∂rg Schneider,Hansj√∂rg Schneider: Das Paar im Kahn: Hunkelers dritter Fall. Diogenes, Z√ºrich 2011, . and was filmed at location in Basel and in Alsace in France. Marie-Louise Bless, director of Das Paar im Kahn, told in an interview that she was contacted by Trudi Roth (Fascht e Familie) in 2000, and urged to read the novel to realize a film adaption. Bless sent the book to Peter Butschert to write the script.  Production   Locations  Rhine in Basel The representation of Basel in the novel, the production team tried to realize as authentic as possible. The postcard Basel would not fit the novel; the film is focussing the unspectacular, easy Basel, the city of the small people and the foreigners which are living there, as well as the Rhein river with its ferries and the Tr√§mli. The production team put the city in a atmospheric, wintery light set. The team was very generously supported by the Basel prosecutor's office and the youth advocate, unfortunately, the police did not provide staff and uniforms for filming.  Implementation of the film adaption  Although the novel's writer Hans J√∂rg Schneider and his publisher were contacted, there was initially no option granted on the film rights, so that the project have been proposed to SR DRS to be realized as a television movie. The co-operation with a first author failed, and Peter Purtschert was involved as an author. Schneider has read some first versions of the script, and was disappointed, because he missed the figure of Hunkeler's girlfriend Hedwig; but the present script he really liked, despite a reduction in the number of minor characters and the laying of internal processes, such as thinking and pondering outward, which were required for the screenplay, to tell the story more stringent as shown in the novel. The focus, however, was the presentation of the fairest possible implementation of Hunkeler's figure and the city of Basel. A movie has its own laws, and economy, hence the part of the detective story had to be told linear. But Putschert expanded the figure of the Roma girl Zarah from Alsace - in the novel a side story, but now directly woven into the homicide case, and so she witnesses the murder.  Kommiss√§r Hunkeler  To determine Hunkeler's unconventional way, his compassion for the little people, his conflicts with colleagues, make him a geek. The Basel police wants to get rid of him because Hunkeler often does not adhere to the rules. As the film director loves thick commissioners, she looked for an actor that was thick, credibly embody the representative of the little people and having charisma. Mathias Gn√§dinger was the ideal choice, even for Hans J√∂rg Schneider: Gn√§dinger is Hunkeler is Gn√§dinger. Mathias Gn√§dinger, in his early years a stage actor at the Theater Neumarkt at Neumarkt, Z√ºrich, died on 3 April 2015, hence the Hunkeler serial comprises six films in all.  Reception  Das Paar im Kahn premierred at 10e Cin√©ma tout √©cran at Geneva in Switzerland in October 2004 and at the 40th Solothurn Film Festival in January 2005.

The brothers played a historic role in Canada's agricultural and industrial development. Early years Ogilvie was born at the family farmhouse at C√¥te-Saint-Michel, Lower Canada (now Quebec) on January 8, 1833, the second son of Alexander Ogilvie and Helen Watson. He received his early education from Mr. Gibson, a Scotsman employed by the English speaking residents of the district to teach their children. He attended high school in Montreal. He lived with his parents working on their farm until April 1855 when he moved to Montreal. Business career A.W. Oglivie & Co. In Montreal, Ogilvie became the first partner of his elder brother Alexander with A. W. Ogilvie & Co., millers and grain dealers, opening their first mill in 1856. The third brother, William Watson, joined them in 1860 and the brothers administered the company for the next forty years as it became Canada's largest flour miller and exporter. Initially, the firm had only one mill, \\"Glenora\\", in Montreal but during the following years expanded its operations to mills in Ontario at Goderich and Seaforth. John, despite objections from those who questioned his sanity in investing in the unsettled West, was one of the few to see the potential of Canadian prairie wheat. The company purchased several thousand acres of prairie land and built numerous wheat elevators and the extensive Winnipeg flour mills. John was in charge of construction and during the last years of his life spent almost half his time in Ontario and Manitoba managing the company‚Äôs expansion. He had a reputation as a shrewd and successful businessman. When Alexander retired from the family business in 1874, John became head of the firm until his death in 1888. Public service Unlike his brothers, he shied away from public life. He was a Justice of the Peace for the District of Montreal and as a young man was in the Montreal troop of cavalry commanded by his brother, Alexander. He was one of the earliest life members of the St. Andrew‚Äôs Society. He was a governor of the Montreal General Hospital and a member of the American Presbyterian Church on Dorchester (now Rene Levesque) Blvd. Marriage and family life On April 28, 1863 he married Margaret Watson (1839-1915), whose father, Thomas Watson, of Brown & Watson, contractors, was involved in the construction of the Victoria Bridge and the Lachine Canal. They had 9 children of whom 8 survived to adulthood. John Ogilvie's health suffered in 1868 when he was thrown from a horse and dragged along the road causing severe injuries. He visited specialists in Britain who did not think he would live much longer. He was unable to exercise as a result of these accidents and suffered from heart problems in his later years. In the hope of restoring his health, he and his wife visited New Mexico, California, and Vancouver in the spring of 1888. He died on July 23, 1888 of heart disease, and is buried in Mount Royal Cemetery.

He was commissioned in the Pembroke Yeomanry in October 1915. He was killed in action in France in September 1918. Another early black officer, Walter Tull, was born in Kent, the son of a black Barbadian carpenter and white Englishwoman; he was commissioned in the Middlesex Regiment on 30 May 1917, and was killed in action on 25 March 1918. A third, George Bemand, was also born in Jamaica, son of a white English father and a black Jamaican mother; he was commissioned in the Royal Field Artillery on 23 May 1915, was killed in action on 26 December 1916. Almost a century earlier, Nathaniel Wells served in the Yeomanry Cavalry of Gloucestershire and Monmouth in 1820 to 1822, and John Perkins served in the Royal Navy from 1775 to 1804. Early life Clemetson was born in Port Maria, in Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica. He was the eldest son of David Robert Clemetson and his wife Mary Eliza, of the Frontier Estate sugar plantation. His grandfather, Robert Clemetson, had been a slave, but he was also the son of his owner; he was freed by his father and became one of the wealthy elite on the island. Robert Clemetson himself owned slaves and, in 1840, was elected to the House of Assembly of Jamaica. Clemetson was educated at Potsdam School in Jamaica, and then Clifton College in Bristol, England, where he served in the Officers' Training Corps. He studied Law at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1912, where he rowed for the First Trinity Boat Club's fourth boat (crewed by the rugby team). First World War Unicorn Cemetery, Vendhuile Following the outbreak of war, Clemetson left college without graduating, and enlisted in the 1st Sportsman's Battalion (the 23rd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers) in 1914. He became an acting lance sergeant, and played in the battalion's rugby team. On the recommendation of his commander Lieutenant Colonel H. J. H. Inglis, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Pembroke Yeomanry on 27 October 1915. His unit was sent to Egypt in March 1916 with the 4th Dismounted Brigade (later the 231st Brigade). He may have served at the Second Battle of Gaza (some reports suggest he served on the Macedonian front in Salonika, but his unit was not sent there). He returned to England after suffering shell shock, and was rescued after the ship taking him back to England, HMHS Dover Castle, was sunk by a German submarine off North Africa on 26 May 1917. While he recuperated at Craiglockhart, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in July 1917. He returned to his unit, which in March 1917, with the Glamorgan Yeomanry, formed the 24th (Pembroke & Glamorgan) Battalion of the Welsh Regiment. He served on the Western Front from March 1918. Clemetson was killed near P√©ronne, on the Somme, in September 1918, less than two months before the Armistice of 11 November 1918. He is now buried at Unicorn Cemetery in Vendhuile, Aisne. He is listed on the British West Indies Regiment memorial in Port Maria, Jamaica. A poem, \\"In Memoriam\\", written by a friend, was published in the Jamaica Gleaner after his death.

But when she is left to herself, she can read it perfectly. The only one who treats her well is Sepp, an almost 60-year-old labourer. He tells her a touching story about North American Indians in which a woman outcast by her tribe is rescued by a white man. The labourer, downtrodden by Beppi's parents, longs for freedom and independence, but is unable to fulfill his social and sexual desires. He can only act as master towards his dog. Act 2 Beppi and Sepp take a ride on a ghost train in an amusement park. Sepp initially comforts the frightened Beppi, but then seduces her. Afterwards he takes her to a restaurant, increasingly developing his new role as her master and protector. When Beppi's parents discover the affair, Staller loses his temper, confronts Sepp, and poisons the dog in revenge. Sepp has to leave the farm and gives Beppi a bar of chocolate as a leaving present. Act 3 Staller and his wife argue about what to do with their pregnant daughter, even contemplating murder. They want her to have an abortion, but don't force it on her out of pity. Like it or not, Beppi must now be taken more seriously than in the past. The play ends with the onset of her labour pains. Sex and violence Stallerhoff and Geisterbahn, both first published in 1971, (although Geistbahn was not performed until 1975) are plays which are known for their sex and violence, with \\"graphic scenes of rape, defecation, masturbation, nudity, and an infanticide\\". In another play, two of the protagonists take turns to shoot and wound each other. The \\"only action\\" in the third scene of this play is said to be the sight of the ageing farmhand masturbating whilst sitting on a toilet. Reception The premiere of the stage play was in Hamburg's Deutsches Schauspielhaus on 24 June 1972, directed by , who was known for social criticism. It made the 18-year-old actress Eva Mattes, who was seen nude for half a scene, famous. wrote on June 26 in the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung that the Beppi played by Mattes gained an aura that Kroetz had probably not even planned. Mattes received the Hamburg Island Award for Best Actress of the Year for her performance in 1972. The film scholar has stated that no later production reached the intensity of the first one. Stallerhof was translated into Hebrew and in 1986 performed at the Habima National Theatre in Israel. In 2014 the play enjoyed a tour across Cyprus by the ONE/OFF group, performed in Greek.  Sequel  In 1975, Stallerhof was followed by the sequel Geisterbahn, which ends with Sepp and Beppi's child being killed.  Opera  In 1988 the Austrian composer Gerd K√ºhr wrote an opera of the same title, on a libretto by Kroetz, closely modeled on the original. It was premiered at the first Munich Biennale. A review notes: \\"Kroetz's Stallerhof is a work about inability to communicate, which opens space for music. ... There is expressionist music, which brings to mind. the inarticulacy and exploitation suffered by Wozzeck. In 2006 it was revived at the Southwark Playhouse in London.

Its only species, Yi qi (Mandarin pronunciation: ; from and ), is known from a single fossil specimen of an adult individual found in Middle or Late Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation of Hebei, China, approximately 159 million years ago. It was a small, possibly tree-dwelling (arboreal) animal. Like other scansoriopterygids, Yi possessed an unusual, elongated third finger, that appears to have helped to support a membranous gliding plane made of skin. The planes of Yi qi were also supported by a long, bony strut attached to the wrist. This modified wrist bone and membrane-based plane is unique among all known dinosaurs, and might have resulted in wings similar in appearance to those of bats. Description Size of the type specimen compared with a human Yi qi is known only from a single partial skeleton (holotype specimen STM 31-2) currently in the collections of the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature. The fossil was compressed and is visible on a stone plate and a counterplate. It is largely articulated, including the skull, lower jaws, neck and limb bones but lacking most of the backbone, pelvis and tail. Yi was a relatively small animal, estimated to weigh about . Like other scansoriopterygids, the head was short and blunt-snouted, with a downturned lower jaw. Its few teeth were present only in the tips of the jaws, with the four upper front teeth per side being the largest and slightly forward-pointing, and the front lower teeth being angled even more strongly forward. The long, slender forelimbs were similar, overall, to those of most other paravian dinosaurs. Like other scansoriopterygid dinosaurs, the first finger was shortest and the third was the longest. Unlike all other known dinosaurs, a long, pointed wrist bone known as a \\"styliform element\\", exceeding both the third finger and the ulna in length, extended backward from the forelimb bones. This styliform, an adaptation to help support the membrane, may have been a newly evolved wrist bone, or a calcified rod of cartilage. It was slightly curved and tapered at its outer end. The only known specimen of Yi qi preserved a heavy covering of feathers. Unusually, based on its classification as an advanced theropod in the clade Pennaraptora (a group containing theropods with advanced, bird-like feathers), the feathers were all very simple in structure and \\"paintbrush- like\\", with long quill-like bases topped by sprays of thinner filaments. All these structures were rather stiff. The feathers covered most of the body, starting near the tip of the snout. The head and neck feathers were long and formed a thick coat, and the body feathers were even longer and denser, making it difficult for scientists to study their detailed structure. The longest feathers, with a length of about six centimetres, were present behind the upper arm and the shinbone. The metatarsus of the foot had a feather covering also. Restoration Small patches of wrinkled skin were also preserved, between the fingers and the styliform bone, indicating that unlike all other known dinosaurs, the planes of Yi qi were formed by a skin membrane rather than flight feathers. The membrane stretched between the shorter fingers, the elongated third finger, the styliform bone, and possibly connected to the torso, though the inner part of the wing membrane was not preserved in the only known fossil. This would have given the animal an appearance similar to modern bats, in an example of convergent evolution. However, in bats, the membrane stretches between the fingers only, no styliform wrist bone being present. Ossified styliform bones are found, however, in the wings of some modern gliding animals like flying squirrels. The greater glider, and the prehistoric gliding rodent Eomys quercyi, also have a similarly long cartilaginous styliform element. On twelve positions the fossil was checked by an electron microscope for the presence of melanosomes, pigment-bearing organelles. All nine feather locations showed eumelanosomes, which cause a black colour. In the head feathers also phaeomelanosomes were present, rendering a more yellow-brownish hue. On the membranes, only one observation had a positive result, of phaeomelanosomes. The eumelanosomes of the calf feathers were exceptionally large. Discovery and naming Skeletal diagram showing known elements The first and only known fossil specimen of Yi qi was found by a farmer, Wang Jianrong, in a quarry near Mutoudeng Village (Qinglong County, Hebei). Wang sold the fossil to the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature in 2007, at which point Ding Xiaoqing, a technician at the museum, began further preparation of the fossil. Because many of the unique features and soft tissues of the specimen were uncovered by museum staff during preparation rather than amateur fossil sellers before the purchase, the scientists who studied it were confident that the specimen was authentic and unaltered. This was confirmed by a CAT scan. The initial study of Yi was published in the journal Nature. The team of scientists who authored this initial study were led by Xu Xing and also included Zheng Xiaoting, Corwin Sullivan, Wang Xiaoli, Xing Lida, Wang Yan, Zhang Xiaomei, Jingmai O'Connor, Zheng Fucheng Zhang and Pan Yanhong. They named and described the type species Yi qi. The generic name Yi means \\"wing\\" in Mandarin. The specific name qi means \\"strange\\". Yi is notable for having the shortest generic name of any dinosaur, containing only two letters. Its binomial name, Yi qi, is also the shortest possible under articles 11.8.1 and 11.9.1 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, at four letters. (It shares this distinction with the great evening bat Ia io.) Classification Yi was placed in the Scansoriopterygidae, a group of maniraptoran theropods. A cladistic analysis failed to resolve its exact relationships with the other known scansoriopterygids, Epidendrosaurus and Epidexipteryx. In the analysis the Scansoriopterygidae was recovered as the most basal clade of the Paraves. Paleobiology Life restoration by Emily Willoughby Yi qi, and presumably other scansoriopterygids, possessed a type of wing unknown among any other prehistoric bird relatives. Unlike other paravian dinosaurs, they seem to have replaced bird-like feathers with membranous wings, in what may have been one of many independent evolutionary experiments with flight close to the origin of birds. The membranous wings of Yi qi are unique among dinosaurs and difficult to interpret. That the arm could in principle function as a wing, is shown by being longer than the already elongated hindlimb and the sufficient thickness of its long bones. Also it is hard to explain the styliform element outside a flight context. The presence of a long styliform bone adding support to the membrane, found only in other animals that glide, suggests that Yi qi was specialized for gliding flight. While it is possible that some form of flapping flight was also used by this animal, the lack of evidence for large pectoral muscles‚Äîthe deltopectoral crest of the humerus being small‚Äîand the cumbersome nature of the styliform, make it more likely that Yi qi was an exclusive glider. At best, the researchers who conducted the initial study of the only known Yi specimen concluded that its mode of flight should be considered uncertain. The authors proposed three main models for the wing configuration. In the \\"bat model\\", the styliform element would have pointed straight to the rear, a membrane connecting styliform and torso. This would have resulted in a broad wing. A variant of the bat model might be the \\"pterosaur model\\" in which the styliform bone would have been directed obliquely to the outside, with a narrower wing as a result. The second main possibility is the \\"maniraptor model\\", in which the styliform element was pointing towards the body, reinforcing the trailing edge of a narrow membrane, possibly widened by feathers, on the top or the underside, sticking out. A last configuration would be the \\"frog model\\", the styliform bone enlarging a membranous hand plane, like that used by flying frogs. In this last case, no membrane would have formed an inner wing but possibly the arm feathers would have generated some lift. A preliminary analysis was made of the flight characteristics of the bat model and the maniraptor model. For both models it was assumed that the wingspan was about sixty centimetres. The narrow wing of the maniraptor model would have resulted in a 320 cm2 wing surface with a wing loading of 1.19 gr/cm2. For the broad bat model wing these values would have been 638 cm2 and 0.6 gr/cm2 respectively. In both cases the wing loading is well below the critical 2.5 gr/cm2 upper limit for bird flight. The maniraptor model loading is typical for ducks, though these have a relatively larger wingspan and a lower aspect ratio. The bat model has a loading typical for shore birds, though again their wingspan is (much) larger while their aspect ratio to the contrary is higher. A problem for the hypothesis that Yi was specialised for gliding flight, resides in the fact that because of it having a forelimb wing, instead of a gliding skin along its torso as with most gliders, its center of mass seems to be behind its control and main lift surfaces, causing flight instability. This problem might have been lessened by a short fleshy tail and long tail feathers, as known from its relative Epidexipteryx. Its stability might also have been improved by a few flapping movements of its wings. A modern analogue is the kakapo, that likewise glides from trees but also flaps to control its descent. Paleoecology The only known Yi qi fossil was found in rocks assigned to the Tiaojishan Formation, dating to the Callovian-Oxfordian age of the Middle-Late Jurassic, dated to approximately 159 million years ago. This is the same formation (and around the same age) as the other known scansoriopterygids Epidexipteryx and Scansoriopteryx. The ecosystem preserved in the Tiaojishan Formation is a forest dominated by bennettitales, ginkgo trees, conifers, and leptosporangiate ferns. These forests surrounded large lakes in the shadow of active volcanoes, ash from which was responsible for the remarkable preservation of many of the fossils. Based on the Tiajishan's plant life, its climate would have been subtropical to temperate, warm and humid. Other vertebrate fossils found in the same rock quarry as Yi qi, which would have been close contemporaries, included salamanders like Chunerpeton tianyiensis, the flying pterosaurs Changchengopterus pani, Dendrorhynchoides mutoudengensis, and Qinglongopterus guoi, as well as the early gliding mammaliaform species Arboroharamiya jenkinsi.

He founded the hotel owning firm of Knapman and Son which survived past the mid-20th Century. His descendants included four of South Australia's most famous sportsmen, a well- known pianist and numerous publicans. History William Knapman was born in Devonshire, England, served an apprenticeship as a carpenter, and on 9 October 1853 married, at St. Andrew's Church, Plymouth, Charlotte Bowden, daughter of a farmer of Christow, near Exeter. They emigrated to South Australia on the Taymouth Castle, arriving in 1854. He worked as a carpenter until 1859, when he was the builder and first licensee of the Lord Exmouth Hotel on LeFevre Peninsula, now the suburb of Exeter. In 1860 he leased George Coppin's \\"White Horse Cellars\\" hotel and theatre at the corner of Commercial Road and St. Vincent Street, Port Adelaide. After seven years he was in a position to purchase the property, and converted the theatre to a brewery (in 1883 he moved the brewery to Cannon Street, dubbed it the \\"Cannon Brewery\\", and converted the property into a block of shops). In 1873 he built the Port Pirie Hotel in Port Pirie, managed by his son-in-law Samuel Wills. In 1876 Knapman and his family moved to Port Pirie, where his wife managed the Port Pirie Hotel. In 1880 Maria Knapman, presumably William's sister, took over the Pilot Boat Hotel, Port Pirie. In 1895, having remarried after the death of Charlotte, he and his family moved to his residence \\"Canonteign\\" (perhaps named for Viscount Exmouth's mansion in Exeter, England) at the corner of Cannon Street and The Minories, Port Adelaide, where he died in 1908, survived by his widow, four children (Alf and Samuel Knapman, \\"Polly\\" Wills and \\"Lottie\\" Ritchie), 22 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.

Vida Silvestre has three offices, located in Buenos Aires, Puerto Iguaz√∫ and Mar del Plata. It also has its own two nature reserves: Urugua-√≠ in Misiones, and San Pablo de Valdez in Chubut.  About Vida Silvestre   History  On April 28, 1976 Alix Reynal died, who in the words of her father Mike Reynal, \\"whenever she was in contact with nature she was totally happy\\". This led him to change his mourning and memory for a living memorial of his daughter. Thus he created an organization dedicated to the conservation of the wildlife of Argentina. Reynal made contact with important people in conservation in the country such as Teodosio Brea, Felipe Lariviere and Francisco Erize. Miguel Reynal was backed by Jose Maria Gallardo, Director of the Argentine Natural History Museum, and Maximo Gainza, Director Editor of La Prensa daily newspaper, who with thirty men of science, sport, culture, politics and the business community, joined up to face the challenge of founding an institution. Their agreement was signed on June 29, 1977 in the Argentine Museum of Natural History. From the very start they worked with the intention of slowly reaching tangible results, with scientific backing. It required the management to be overseen by the scientific sector which was achieved by the creation of a committee of specialists who helped to choose programs and evaluate results. In 1988 Vida Silvestre became the official representative of WWF in Argentina.  Workteam  Management is divided in two parts. The administrative council, currently presided by Marina Harteneck. It also has support from a scientific committee formed by a team of specialists. The management structure is a team made up of some 40 persons who include biologists, agriculturalists, foresters, electrical engineers, geographers, museum specialists, communicators, teachers, lawyers, environmental scientists, politicians, all working in three offices ‚Äì Buenos Aires, Iguazu and Mar del Plata. As of 2017, Vida Silvestre's CEO is Manuel Jaramillo.  Work  Overuse of natural resources is the major topic of Vida Silvestre's work. At present human activity uses up more resources than our planet can provide. As a result, we need 1.3 planets to support human activity and conserve species and ecosystems that are in danger. Climate change is the most visible result of humanity's use of natural resources on a global scale. To face this situation Vida Silvestre defined four work strategies.  For more protected areas  Throughout its history Vida Silvestre has been involved in the creation and effective management of over twenty protected public areas, marine and on land, municipal, provincial and national thus contributing to the protection of over 7.5 million hectares destined for conservation and sustainable use of nature. This has been achieved through various forms of participation ‚Äì purchase of lands for donating to the state; management and support actions of public policies, and identification, evaluation, and drawing up of areas for consideration and/or revision of projects, laws or decrees. In this sense different strategies are followed, such as the identification of valuable areas for conservation in priority eco- regions with the object of encouraging the creation of protected areas. In 1983 Vida Silvestre did a survey of the Urugua-√≠ stream in Misiones, where a dam was planned, and proposed measures to compensate the loss of natural areas which led to the creation of Islas Malvinas Provincial Reserve protecting ten thousand hectares of Atlantic rainforest and its subsequent increase to the 87 thousand hectares of the Urugua√≠ Provincial Park. In 1985 the Somuncura plateau in Patagonia was explored and from the report in which Vida Silvestre proposed its conservation in 1986 the Somuncura Plateau Provincial Reserve of one million hectares in northern Patagonia was created. Two years later Vida Silvestre started the first complete evaluation of Patagonia's coastal areas and initiated the paper work for the creation of Cabo Blanco Provincial Park with the Isla Pinguino Complex ‚Äì Oso Marino Bay, which in 2010 was declared an inter-jurisdictional marine park, and Monte Leon Island a national park since 2004. Vida Silvestre actively promotes the creation and management of protected areas with important precedents for Argentina and the region. In 2003 Vida Silvestre was awarded the Conservar el Futuro Prize by the National Parks Administration in recognition of its work on protected areas. Some of the contributions include the first two private reserves in Argentina, today a fundamental system of conservation: in 1979 Laguna de los Escarchados in the province of Santa Cruz, and the Campos del Tuy√∫, a wildlife reserve in the province of Buenos Aires, this last under an agreement with the land owners. In 2009 Campos del Tuy√∫ was donated to the National Parks Administration, thus creating the first national park in the Pampas grasslands. In 1997 through an agreement with Alto Parana S.A., a reserve of 3243 hectares bordering the Urugua-√≠ provincial park, the Urugua-√≠ Wildlife Reserve was created, and administered by Vida Silvestre. Eight years later the San Pablo de Valdez Wildlife Reserve (7360 hectares) came into being, the first private property to protect the habitat within Peninsula Valdez provincial natural area, a world heritage site of UNESCO. In 1983 the Ribera Norte Wildlife refuge was created under an agreement with San Isidro municipality ‚Äì the first protected municipal area in the country. Two years later thanks to a team coordinated by Vida Silvestre, the Costanera Sur Ecological Reserve came into being, the most important area for biodiversity in Buenos Aires city with over 300 hectares. In 1991 the National Parks Administration created Otamendi National Reserve in Buenos Aires province following a recommendation by Vida Silvestre. That same year the Punta Rasa Municipal Reserve of 520 hectares of coastal grassland and dunes was also created by initiative of Vida Silvestre because of research made on the importance of the area for migratory birds. In 2014 Vida Silvestre supported the creation of El Impenetrable National Park, part of La Fidelidad Estancia in Chaco Province, one of the last stands of Chaco Woodland. Other conservation- related activities include the environmental impact studies of gas pipelines in the northern Andes and Atacama desert and a series of proposed areas for compensation. Thanks to this, reserves El Nogalar (4000 hectares) and Provincial Park Laguna Pintascayo (12,139 hectares) both in Salta Province came into being. Meanwhile, for ten years, Vida Silvestre trained 50 technicians and park rangers, as well as national rangers for protected areas on the Atlantic coasts of Argentina, Uruguay and the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) in tools and methods of monitoring migratory shore- birds. Through agreements with ranger training centers, scholarships for students from the Urugua-√≠ and San Pablo de Valdez Wildlife Reserves were a further contribution. As from 1987 the Vida Silvestre Wildlife Refuge Programme has grown successfully, the first system of voluntarily protected areas in Argentina, the pioneer programme for Latin America, with over l77.000 hectares of high biological value in 9 provinces in the country. Some of these are over l0 years old. Since 2014 Vida Silvestre has coordinated the Argentine network of private nature reserves which encompasses different organizations in private conservation: 58 reserves covering over l80.000 hectares in 15 provinces and 15 different private organizations in a unique network at a national level. Vida Silvestre participates in the management committee as an organizer, as well as owner, because of its own wildlife reserves.  Towards effective legislation  According to Article 41 of Argentina's constitution, all inhabitants have a right to a healthy environment, balanced, fit for human development and where productive activities satisfy present needs without committing those of future generations, and must preserve them. By law priority must be given to reparation of environmental damage. Authorities will ensure the fulfillment of this requirement, proper use of natural resources, preservation of natural and cultural heritage and biological diversity, as well as environmental information and education. For this reason Vida Silvestre works non-stop with governments, legislators, and organizations to have an input in environmental legislation, promote a state policy that plans strategically; and support procedures that guarantee environmental protection. In 1990 Vida Silvestre took to court, oral and public, the first environmental case against illegal trade of wildlife. This ended in a conviction. Three years later, in 1993 the organization collected 1,200,000 signatures from citizens to back the inclusion of Environmental Crime in the Civil Code. Though the aim was not achieved it was the first step towards awakening the public to the importance of the subject. Towards the end of 2007 Congress approved law 26.331 for Minimal Budgets for Environmental Protection of natural woodlands. However the Executive Government only brought out the pertinent regulations in February 2009, after an appeal made by over 70 social organizations, Vida Silvestre amongst them. The Woodland Law (Ley de Bosques) makes the provinces responsible for the territorial order of their native woodlands (Orden Territorial de Bosques Nativos) through a participative process, categorizing the possible uses of wooded lands: from conservation to the possibility of transformation to agricultural ends, or the sustainable exploitation of the woods. Thus woodlands undergo zoning as follows: first category (red) areas of very high value for conservation that should never be cleared nor used for the extraction of timber, but kept as woodland forever. This would include nature reserves and surrounding areas with outstanding biological values, and/or areas that protect important watersheds (headwaters of streams and rivers); second category (yellow) areas of high or medium conservation interest that can have been degraded but with restoration could have high conservation value. These areas may not be cleared (deforested) but may be used for the following: sustainable use, tourism, scientific collection and studies; third category (green): sectors of low conservation value that could be partially or totally altered, after an environmental impact evaluation. As from the passing of the woodlands law the average yearly deforestation has been reduced by almost 20 percent, passing from about 280,000 to 230,000 hectares yearly. This figure is still too high. Between 2008 and 2011 some 932,109 hectares in the jurisdictions evaluated by the experts in Santiago del Estero province, 399,660 hectares of native woodland had been cleared; in Salta it was 222,868 hectares; in Formosa 113,109 Hectares; and Chaco province lost 102,592 hectares. This shows that between passing the law and late 2012, 1,145,044 hectares were cleared of forest. Vida Silvestre believes that special attention should be paid to the Chaco eco- region which has been subjected to the greatest loss of native woodlands over the last 20 years. This makes it essential that dialogue be held between the provincial governments to revise their territorial ordering of natural woodland that cross political borders, and that there should be uninterrupted landscape between the different provinces that include the eco-region. A complete revision of the possible alternative models of sustainable production also needs to be implemented in the yellow areas of the map, within the framework of genuine dialogue and analysis, between the social, productive and environmental sectors. These matters in question are fundamental to solve and initiate administrative mechanisms to improve the efficiency of using the funds provided by the laws through the provinces, with additions to the funds corresponding to the National government's budget. The Woodland Law is a tool to be applied properly for the conservation of our native woodlands. In this sense Vida Silvestre participates in and monitors the application of this standard norm in the provinces within the priority eco-regions: Gran Chaco (Chaco, Formosa, Salta, Santiago del Estero) and the Panaraense rainforest (Misiones) to promote sustainable use over time, of the native woodlands of Argentina. In 2013 Vida Silvestre through its Earth Hour campaign promoted the law to create the first Protected Marine Area in the country, of the Burdwood Bank (Namuncur√°) some 34,000 square kilometers of great biodiversity subject to environmental changes, located within Argentina's exclusive economy zone. With technical data this undersea plateau increases the area of protected Argentine seas from one percent to about 3.2 percent. That same year Vida Silvestre organized the first International Meeting on Protected Oceanic Marine Areas. The meeting aimed at government representatives, civil organizations, research institutes, and the private sector working on the conservation of marine resources, was aimed at improving the local capacity and providing tools for the creation and implementation of a system of protected marine areas, the law being passed in 2014.  For responsible production and consumption  All stages of production generate an impact on the environment, which does not depend solely on the activity as such, but also on the ways they are carried out. The main factors of the ecological footprint in Argentina are the source and consumption of energy, and the changes in soil use as a result of agricultural and forestry practices. Argentina is basically a producer and exporter of commodities, with its natural resources covers its internal consumption needs and that of distant regions such as Europe and USA. This is why Vida Silvestre works in coordination with WWF to promote changes in the global market aimed at countries, companies and citizens to develop commercial practices that try to reduce the global ecological footprint and as a result, the impact on climate change and natural resources. = Forestry = Since 2002 the organization promotes responsible forest management leading the forest certification in Argentina under FSC standards and the creation of the Forestry Business Network. The FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) is an international organization whose object is to promote environmentally responsible, socially beneficial and economically viable uses of the world's forest. To achieve its aims it has developed national and international standards and the system of certification to identify and label products from well-managed forests. This has been developed with the participation of different interest groups such as forest owners, administrators, producers of forestry products, local communities and NGOs amongst others. Vida Silvestre is a member of FSC's environmental committee and from 2002 to mid 2006, FSC's contact organization in Argentina. During this period Vida Silvestre assumed responsibility for promoting their certification system at a national level. As well as activities of promoting FSC in the country; during that time a work group of representatives of environmental, social and economic sectors was formed. With them were drawn up the Procedures for Development of Norms for Management of Forests in Argentina, and the country's norms for Forest Management of plantations. = Energy = In 2006 Vida Silvestre presented the report on the Energy Situation in Argentina between 2006-2020; it was estimated the reduction potential for that period could be between 30 and 48 percent referring to emissions foreseen for 2020, if policies for reducing consumption are applied. An important part of this potential saving is in the residential sector and the commercial/public sector. These two sectors represent 62 percent of the potential saving of electricity. In 2011 Vida Silvestre published the WWF study on renewable energy: \\"l00 % Renewable Energy by 2050\\" which shows that the energy needs of the planet can be satisfied in a \\"clean\\" renewable way as well as economically possible, by 2050. The report which took two years preparation includes an analysis carried out by WWF and a setting presenting by Ecofys, specialists on the subject of energies. The analysis shows that by 2050 energy production for transport, industrial activities and domestic needs, could be obtained with but a tiny fraction of fossil and nuclear fuels. Energy efficiency in buildings, vehicles and industries will be the key ingredient together with energy from electricity generated in a sustainable way, distributed via \\"intelligent\\" electricity networks to reach their objective. In 2013 this report was updated. Argentina's energy 2013-2030, with efficiency policies reflected in the measures already implemented in the sector has started to show concrete results. Further, Vida Silvestre promotes the application of energy efficiency labeling on various products so that consumers can consider options with reduced emissions. Energy efficiency labeling with information on such products provides adequate data from the energy point of view. Argentina's energy efficiency labeling, as in Europe and other countries shows a comparative scale of types of efficiency, identified with colors and letters that vary according to the apparatus, informing in a simple way the level of energy an apparatus uses. So far in Argentina this is obligatory for refrigerators, lamps, washing machines, air conditioners, cooking stoves, railways, and water heaters. The system can be enlarged to cover all appliances such as electric motors, gas equipment, homes, automobiles, doors and windows, etc. = Fishery = Vida Silvestre aims at establishing a sustainable fishing model, working with different sectors related to the sea to promote sustainable administered fishing, adequately regulated and implemented through sustainable and responsible fishing practices, environmentally friendly, and all this within the framework of a new model of fisheries development that guarantees economic environmental social and political sustainability of the sector based on varying strategies. These would include a system of fisheries-management based on the best scientific information available, applying precautionary criteria and an eco- systemic approach; developing a participative governability that contributes towards generating agreement and commitment between all parties and promoting responsible fishing practices. It includes public access to the information; updating the legal framework, with dynamic focusing that ensures compliance with fisheries policies regarding sustainable management; implement a system of monitoring fisheries which is efficient and clear, giving trustworthy data (statistics; control checking of inboard catch; discarded rejects and off- loading rejects, and with onboard observers); adjusting the potential catch to the availability of the resource; incorporating selective capture technologies; optimizing technological and economical aspects to raise the value of fishery resources, taking advantage of incidental catch, diversifying products and processing them with value added and intensive labor. So after the coordinated work, the first fisheries management model based in Argentina's ecosystem based in Golfo San Mat√≠as, Rio Negro province, was developed. This model fishery was concrete evidence that all this is possible. Since 2004, together with local companies, the government of the province of Rio Negro and the Marine Biology Institute (MBI) in San Antonio Oeste, Vida Silvestre promotes the Golfo San Matias as a model to follow. At the same time the national authorities were encouraged to back planning of the industry based on the best scientific data available, considering the sustainability of the resource as a basis for fishing. Vida Silvestre works simultaneously on informing on fishing problems, especially with hake, having campaigned towards dealing only with adult specimens (yielding fillets of over 20 cm in length) and proposals of markets for other species of fish. As to the certification, Vida Silvestre promoted a sustainable environmental alternative through a program of fishery licensing of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). Such licensing of fisheries aims at recognizing and favoring good fishing practices and providing a simple way for buyers and consumers to identify sustainable marine resources. In Argentina at present there are three fisheries with MSC certification: Patagonian scallops (2006), the first scallop in the world to be thus certified, the anchovy sardine of Buenos Aires (2012) the world's first such fishery to be certified (2011) and the Argentine hake (2012). Including these in a medium long term plan, MSC's ecolabelling is aimed as a tool for regional, sustainable development. = Livestock = Studies aimed at identifying important areas for the conservation of Pampas grasslands and wildlife (especially birds) that depend on them have shown that well-kept pampas grasslands were mostly private properties and the reason that they were well preserved was mostly due to having been used carefully for extensive cattle raising. So Vida Silvestre deduced that these ranchers and their extensive cattle-raising were conservation's allies. Since then we work together with the productive sector to conserve and manage carefully this natural capital ‚Äì the Pampas grassland, home to a valuable and unique biodiversity, in many cases threatened with extinction, but at the same time a grazing resource supporting one of the most important economic activities of the country. Meanwhile, Vida Silvestre has identified some management practices that generate changes in the habitat, such as permanent grazing, introduction of winter forage through use of herbicides, inadequate management of livestock \\"loads\\" and replacement of natural grassland by sown lays. At the same time such practices may hasten degradation of the pasture and start erosion and salinization of the soil with negative effects on production. In 2006, together with members of the Field Veterinary Program of the Wildlife Conservation Society a model sanitary program was drawn up for production together with conservation in cattle lands of Samboromb√≥n Bay. This was developed from a series of studies of cattle on lands neighboring protected areas in the region. It included not only direct evaluation of infectious diseases and the parasitological situation, but also surveys of cattle breeders in the area to evaluate their sanitary measures. Together with Aves Argentinas and the Grasslands Alliance Initiative and with the support of INTA (National Institute of Agricultural Technology), Vida Silvestre carried out the project Grassland and Savannahs of the Southern Cone of South America: an initiative for their conservation in Argentina, with the main objective of promoting sustainable cattle ranching in grasslands, promoting the inclusion of nature conservation and production. 21 farms covering some 59,700 hectares are already being worked with sustainable cattle-raising following the results of the program. In the region within the Grassland Alliance this increases to 121,000 hectares that participate in the certification program. In this way and with technical assistance, environmental evaluation and monitoring, as well as management policies and incentives applied to sustainable production systems, Vida Silvestre seeks to support those who show willingness and interest in the conservation in our natural resources. = Soy = As a consequence of soy production huge areas of woodlands, grasslands and savannah were lost to agriculture. All together the area of land in South America where soy beans are grown increased from l7 million hectares in 1990 to 46 million in 2010, mostly on lands converted from natural eco-systems. Between 2000 and 2010 there were 24 million hectares converted to crops in South America and soy beans increased some 20 million over the same period. On this subject Vida Silvestre participates in the RTRS (Round Table for Responsible Soy) in search for a solution, considering that the sustainability of the soil and water should interest the producer because they are part of his production resources, his possibility of further crops in the future. Sound agricultural practices must be generally adopted, including crop rotation; integrated management of pests, responsible use of agrochemicals, and conservation- oriented tilling of the soil. These practices are understood and known to all, communicated by private and official organizations. Regrettably their application is not generally practiced. All this can be promoted through public policies that establish regulatory, clear and imposable frameworks as well as incentives for sustainable production to be made more profitable. Further, on this subject, WWF in 2014, published \\"Growing Soy: Impact and Solutions\\" that explains the magnitude of the problem, the factors that favor it, and how each one of us has a role in implementing solutions.  Toward more awareness and environmental education  Vida Silvestre has been involved in environmental education since 1978 through pioneering in exposing adults and children to Nature through conservation safaris. These produced a generation of nature-aware people through camps that combined adventure with getting to know Argentina's natural riches, with fun and learning about the value of Nature. Over 7000 participants got to know about wildlife and such through more than 150 educational safaris. In 2014 Vida Silvestre re-launched the safari program with trips that include recreation in contact with Nature, aimed at all sectors of the public; children, youth of scholastic age, Vida Silvestre members, companies, families, teachers.... They partake in activities in Nature, are exposed to teamwork under tutelage of biologists, park rangers, and experts in the field. As from 1982 our magazine Vida Silvestre has been published, being the first in Argentina to cover conservation topics. Over time it has received several prizes for exposing the problems of the environment, including the ADEPA prize in 1999 and 2003 and the Santa Clara de Asis in 2004. The latest issues may be consulted free of charge in their digital edition in Vida Silvestre's website. A pioneer in covering environmental topics, in 1981 Vida Silvestre sponsored the TV series Wonderful World of Animals aired on Saturdays on public television. In 1982 Argentina's leading naturalists gave courses on conservation for Vida Silvestre; they included Pablo Canevari, Jose Maria Gallardo and Enrique Bucher. In 1986 educational guides and posters were printed covering the various natural regions of the country, the first such in this field. The next year this was followed up by a poster on the Misiones Subtropical Forest. In 1997 Vida Silvestre put out a box of educational material on the Andean deer (huemul) after a great effort for the conservation of this emblematic species from Patagonia. That same year educational material \\"Aprend√© Jugando\\" (Learn while Playing) with Villa del Sur bottled water, was very popular. For Vida Silvestre teachers fill a central role in the awakening in the up-and-coming generations about how humans relate to Nature. For this reason we continually offer different tools for teachers throughout the country to incorporate in their environmental subjects. Allied to prestigious places of learning Vida Silvestre offers courses, seminars, talks and training to teachers for them to find a way to share their knowledge and experiences under guidance from various experts on the subject. In 1992 there were l000 teachers trained by Vida Silvestre; in 2010 a box of materials was prepared for Misiones province; 25 teachers and 200 students received materials in l30 schools. Indirectly this reached 528 teachers and 5,300 students in the province. In 2012 a similar box of materials to cover the urban environment was launched in Buenos Aires; it reached l000 schools plus 4000 students. That same year teacher- training courses were held in 5 provinces, reaching l00 teachers.  Work with local fauna  = Pampas deer and others = In 1992 Vida Silvestre launched a campaign for \\"adoption\\" of Pampas deer: this is a grassland species in critical danger of extinction with only 4 small populations in the country. Earlier Vida Silvestre had created a natural reserve (Campos del Tuy√∫) to protect its habitat. In 1996 \\"Grasslands and Pampas Deer\\" a video of the San Luis specimens, was edited. Today the challenge is to promote sustainable cattle raising in Tuy√∫'s neighboring lands. Cattle-ranching there is producing quality beef from natural grasslands which also provide prime habitat for the endangered Pampas deer. This has been made possible by the joint efforts of ranchers, municipalities, national and provincial organizations. There are possibly only 3000 of these Pampas deer in the country, all but a very few sharing habitat with cattle ‚Äì preservation of the habitat through management and good husbandry practices are essential to the Pampas deers' conservation. Other work with deer carried out by Vida Silvestre includes the Huemul Project started in 1986 to protect one of the scarcest deer in the world, resident in Argentina's Patagonia. Three years later, thanks to Vida Silvestre this species was declared a \\"natural monument\\". In 1997 an educational box on the huemul was launched, the contents awakening awareness of the plight of this species. Further, in 1978 Vida Silvestre, together with New York Zoological Society and the National Parks Administration set up a breeding facility for the pudu on Victoria Island. In 1986 Vida Silvestre made the first release of this species back into Nahuel Huapi National Park. = Whales and other cetaceans = Between May and December every year some 2400 southern right whales return to the Gulfs bordering Valdez Peninsula ‚Äì a World Natural Heritage Site ‚Äì to breed and bear their offspring. Vida Silvestre works in monitoring just what happens in the region to help in the slow but constant recuperation of this species and others associated with it through regulating activities in the gulfs, an especially in Nueva bay. In 1983 Vida Silvestre led the first campaign of whale- and dolphin-watching in the Antarctic. The next year it headed an appeal to stop whaling. Since 1999 Vida Silvestre supports the Estimate of the Abundance of Southern Right Whales and Other Small Cetaceans in the Area of Valdez Peninsula that the Centro Nacional Patagonico carries out yearly by aerial census. Thanks to the information thus gathered it is now known that the number of whales has doubled over the last 10 years; today there are some 2500 that visit Valdez. In the same year Vida Silvestre started a photographic catalogue for identification of individuals from these images of the right whales of Valdez. Thanks to a provincial initiative, tour operators, tour agencies, research institutes, Vida Silvestre and other NGOs, a law has been passed that regulates the main activity of the area by setting behavioral codes for whale watching. At present Vida Silvestre monitors the correct implementation of the law. In 2011, together with local and international organization Vida Silvestre called for diplomatic action to reject Japan's recent announcement that it was renewing its \\"scientific\\" harvest of whales in the Southern Oceans. That same year WWF published a document on climate change and how this affects whales. It was distributed by Vida Silvestre. = Pumas and guanacos = In 2012 Vida Silvestre launched a campaign for the protection of the puma and the guanaco which got enormous public support because of proposed laws declaring them \\"plague species\\"; in Rio Negro Province law no. 763/72 economically encourages those who kill pumas on their property, while in Santa Cruz province resolution 109 of the Chamber of Deputies declared the guanaco a pest species because of their large numbers, their biological characteristics and their economic damage as well as the harm to Society they produce. Vida Silvestre sent letters to the responsible authorities in each province requesting that they abolish the measures and launched a campaign to collect signatures over one week receiving 36,000 adherents. = Jaguars = In Argentina there are less than 200 jaguars left. Loss of their woodland and forest habitat as a result of deforestation, illegal hunting, or indiscriminate killing of their prey species, and conflicts with farm stock directly affect the survival of these animals. According to studies over these last years it is estimated that in the Paranaense rain forest some 60 individuals still survive. This emblematic species, a natural monument of Argentina, is a priority for Vida Silvestre who since 2003 has funded researchers from CelBA-CONICET jointly with the Ministry of Ecology, Misiones Renewable Natural Resources Secretariat, and the National Parks Administration in developing projects to study the situation of the jaguar in the Paranaense Rain Forest. All the information obtained in these years has been basic in drawing up a jaguar conservation plan. The studies so far have revealed that the population of jaguars in the Paranaense suffered a drastic decrease over the last 15 years. This shows us the need to take serious concrete action to turn this situation around. Vida Silvestre supports researches by providing funds and broadcasting this specie's problems. Further the jaguar is a priority species for WWF who support jaguar programmes in several countries where this species exists, such as Peru and Brazil. In 2014 with the help of Vida Silvestre, the documentary Jaguar: The Last Frontier was released, directed by Marcelo Vi√±as and produced by Juan Maria Raggio, narrated by Ricardo Darin, depicting the status of the species and the problems it faces. The documentary had its premiere in various cinemas and festivals, was released through internet, reaching over 25,000 people in this country.

Its northern end starts in the Seaton Village neighbourhood and it passes through Mirvish Village, Palmerston‚ÄìLittle Italy, Trinity‚ÄìBellwoods and ends at West Queen Street West at its south end. Character Markham Street intersects with several neighbourhoods consisting mainly of residential side streets full of semi-detached homes, mostly built in the early 20th century. The major cross streets Bloor Street, Harbord Street, College Street, Dundas Street and Queen Street run east‚Äìwest, are mainly commercial in nature and are two to four-lane arterial roads. To the east is Bathurst Street, running north‚Äìsouth, another four-lane arterial road with mostly residences along both sides. To the west is north‚Äìsouth Palmerston Boulevard. Trinity‚ÄìBellwoods House numbering on Markham Street begins at Queen Street West. Walking north into the Trinity‚ÄìBellwoods neighbourhood from Queen to Herrick Street, it is a two-lane street with traffic one-way down from north to south. The street is residential on both sides consisting of mainly of two-storey semi-detached or row houses north to College Street. Very few houses look alike. Many homes have Victorian or Edwardian architectural styles. At Dundas, the intersection meets two story buildings with restaurants and a brewery. Palmerston‚ÄìLittle Italy At College, the street enters Palmerston‚ÄìLittle Italy under an intimate canopy of mature trees lining the road. The intersection has two multi-storey commercial buildings and two mainly residential buildings. The former warehouse Pedlar People Building at 473-489 College Street has many offices and board gaming restaurant/bar Snakes and Lattes on the south west corner. On the south-east corner is Ideal Lofts condominium which contains a Shoppers Drug Mart. On the north-west corner at 474 College Street is a brutalist medical centre building. On the east is Lunsky Optometry, established in 1933. North of College, are two-storey homes, although further to the north, the homes are larger, and some are three storeys tall and Edwardian in vintage. North of Harbord Street, the homes continue in their eclectic mix of styles, generally three storeys, and semi-detached. North of Herrick Street, the traffic is one-way from south to north, part of the \\"traffic maze\\" in the neighbourhood implemented to reduce traffic flows through the neighbourhood. Mirvish Village The former Honest Ed's and Victorian homes in Mirvish Village Mirvish Village is a commercial enclave on Markham Street that runs one block south of Bloor Street. It has changed radically since 2018. Five apartment towers and a parkette are now under construction by Westbank Corp. Along this stretch, former homes that were once converted to art-related uses, retail, or restaurants have been demolished with facades preserved. Also gone is the Toronto landmark Honest Ed's department store which owned the former homes. The business dominated the Bloor St intersection from Markham Street to Bathurst Street from 1948-2016. In March 2015, developer Westbank Properties, which had bought the Mirvish Village and Honest Ed's properties in 2013 announced their plans for the area. Markham Street from Bloor to Lennox Street would become a \\"pedestrian- friendly\\" street with restricted vehicular access. The roadway would be replaced with paving from paving stones, with added trees and expanded room for patios. Fourteen of the existing former homes along Markham would be retained, with new buildings at Bloor Street. Immediately west on Bloor Street is Koreatown. Seaton Village North of Bloor, the street enters Seaton Village and intersects with the Bathurst (TTC) subway station's west entrance and a municipal parking lot atop the subway on the west side. Further north on the east side is St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church and its associated buildings which dominate the block to London Street. Traffic is one-way north along this block, and it is one-way south along the rest of its length. On the next block north is Monsignor Fraser College on the full length of the west side. It is a modernist two-storey structure with brick facade like the neighbourhood. The homes along this stretch are typically two-storey semi- detached. North of Barton, the west side of the street is dominated by the 38 Barton Street apartment building, which is three and a half storeys in height (its first floor is elevated a half floor to give light to basement apartments). The street ends one block north at Folis Avenue.

The section bars the States from imposing any tax that would be considered to be of a customs or excise nature. While customs duties are easy to determine, the status of excise, as summarised in Ha v New South Wales, is that it consists of \\"taxes on the production, manufacture, sale or distribution of goods, whether of foreign or domestic origin.\\" This effectively means that States are unable to impose sales taxes. Whether a State tax is of an excise nature or not has been the subject of numerous cases in the High Court of Australia, and it has had difficulty in reaching a clear majority opinion as to how \\"excise\\" should be interpreted in specific circumstances. It has been described as \\"one of the significant failures of the High Court.\\" Text Scope Starting with Peterswald v Bartley (1904), it was initially held that \\"excise\\" is an indirect tax, and is accordingly based on the definition given by John Stuart Mill: However, since Dennis Hotels Pty Ltd v Victoria, it has been held that indirectness is neither a necessary nor sufficient quality for such a tax. Since the High Court's ruling in Parton v Milk Board, subsequently endorsed unanimously in Bolton v Madsen, excise duties in the Australian context are generally agreed to apply in several situations: :* \\"What probably is essential is that it should be a tax upon goods before they reach the consumer.\\"Parton, at p. 260 :* \\"A tax upon a commodity at any point in the course of distribution before it reaches the consumer produces the same effect as a tax upon its manufacture or production.\\" :* \\"It is probably a safe inference ... that a tax on consumers or upon consumption cannot be an excise.\\"Parton, at p. 261, citing In Hematite Petroleum Pty Ltd v Victoria, it was further held: In Gosford Meats Pty Ltd v New South Wales, Gibbs CJ summarised the position by stating that \\"an impost cannot be an excise unless it is a tax upon, or in respect of, a step in the production, manufacture, sale or distribution of goods.\\"Gosford Meats, per Gibbs CJ at par. 8 While the reasoning of these cases appears straightforward, the application has not. The High Court held in a series of cases that license and franchise fees did not constitute \\"excise\\", such as: #a levy of six per cent of the wholesale value of liquor on liquor retailers (Dennis Hotels); #a license fee scheme for the sale of petrol (HC Sleigh); #a licence fee calculated using a back-dating device (i.e., by reference to results of a preceding period) (Parton); and #a tobacco licensing scheme (Dickenson's Arcade, Philip Morris). However, other taxes have been held to be \\"excise\\": #a levy which fell equally upon local and imported petrol (Petrol Case); #a consumption tax on tobacco (Dickenson's Arcade); #taxing receipts issued by vendors that acknowledged payment of the purchase price of commodities (Hamersley); #a tax on the processing of fish intended for human consumption (MG Kailis); #a tax on livestock used in the production of meat or wool (Logan Downs); #a pipeline charge held to be an excise on petrol (Hematite); #a meat industry licence (Gosford Meats); and #an X-rated video licensing scheme (Capital Duplicators). But Ha v New South Wales has since cast doubt on State licensing schemes previously held to be valid for tobacco, alcohol and petrol, and which have accounted for a significant portion of State revenues. Ha held that where such a scheme is not in reality of a regulatory nature, it is therefore invalid: This has created significant debate as to the validity of other State taxation schemes, such as in the recent trend for States to extend stamp duty to certain dealings in goods.

He has also reported at least twenty doctors to the General Medical Council in the course of two decades of investigating research misconduct.  Background   Sterling-Winthrop case  In 1986, Wilmshurst, a cardiologist then working at St. Thomas' Hospital, London, approached The Guardian newspaper with a substantial dossier detailing alleged misconduct in the development of Amrinone, a cardiac drug manufactured by Sterling-Winthrop. The drug was supported by a study at Harvard Medical School and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, whose lead author was Eugene Braunwald, a leader in his field. Wilmshurst's group ran a series of experiments on the promising new drug but found no effect on contractility and frequent life-threatening side effects. Wilmshurst reported these findings to Sterling-Winthrop, who asked him to suppress the data. He refused, and they retaliated by threatening litigation. He continued the research and published his adverse findings in abstracts and conference presentations, until Sterling-Winthrop staff removed all stocks of the drug from the hospital pharmacy. A review by the Netherlands Committee for the Evaluation of Medicine found substantial discrepancies between the record cards of Wilmshurst's group and those submitted by Sterling-Winthrop. Wilmshurst showed that they had falsified the records, suppressing the adverse events he had reported. He then contacted the UK's Committee for the Safety of Medicines and discovered that Sterling-Winthrop had also failed to report the adverse events to the UK; they had also threatened the UK Government with closure of a large manufacturing plant in the UK. Sterling-Winthrop subsequently reported over 1,400 adverse events to the US Federal Food and Drug Administration, and terminated research and marketing in the US, while continuing to market the drug in the developing world. Finally, after a substantial Guardian feature, they withdrew the oral drug entirely in 1986. In 2003 he was given the Health Watch Award for this work.  NMT Medical case  In 2000, Wilmshurst published a paper linking migraine to patent foramen ovale, a common cardiac condition affecting up to one in four people. This led NMT Medical to develop a PFO closure device branded STARflex. Wilmshurst was recruited as part of the \\"Migraine Intervention with STARflex Technology\\" (MIST) trial. The number of patients and potential value of the market (estimated in excess of $15bn) drove NMT's stock price to $25/share. A substantial discrepancy emerged between echocardiogram result interpretations of the implanting cardiologists and Wilmshurst's review. Wilmshurst reported a significantly higher proportion (one in three versus four in sixty-five) with residual cardiac shunts. An independent review backed Wilmshurst's figures. Less than a fortnight after returning from a conference in Washington where he discussed his results, Wilmshurst was contacted by lawyers for NMT making accusations of \\"seriously defamatory allegations\\". The first NMT libel suit was lodged in 2007, and drew media attention. NMT served four separate writs on Wilmshurst. The courts demanded that they lodge ¬£200,000 due to their parlous financial state and the likelihood of failing in the action. NMT declared bankruptcy after pursuing Wilmshurst for over three years.  Bawa-Garba Case  In light of the Hadiza Bawa-Garba case, Dr Peter Wilmhurst has both referred himself to the GMC, as well as asking the regulatory body to both remove himself from the register, and scrutinise his medical practice. This is due to the ongoing concern felt by medical practitioners in England with the GMC's outcome and appeal (successfully won) against Bawa-Garba. Multiple parties have been concerned about the outcome of this hearing, as well as the repercussions on current medical practice.  Libel reform  Wilmshurst's experience, along with British Chiropractic Association v Singh, have been cited as catalysts for the UK's libel reform campaign, leading to the Defamation Act 2013.

The tunnelling units were occupied in offensive and defensive mining involving the placing and maintaining of mines under enemy lines, as well as other underground work such as the construction of deep dugouts for troop accommodation, the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches and underground chambers for signals and medical services.The Tunnelling Companies RE , access date 25 April 2015 Background By January 1915 it had become evident to the BEF at the Western Front that the Germans were mining to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter- tactics or underground listening devices before the war, field marshals French and Kitchener agreed to investigate the suitability of forming British mining units. Following consultations between the Engineer-in-Chief of the BEF, Brigadier George Fowke, and the mining specialist John Norton-Griffiths, the War Office formally approved the tunnelling company scheme on 19 February 1915. Norton-Griffiths ensured that tunnelling companies numbers 170 to 177 were ready for deployment in mid-February 1915.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 49. In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the BEF was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 165. To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer. These companies each comprised 5 officers and 269 sappers; they were aided by additional infantrymen who were temporarily attached to the tunnellers as required, which almost doubled their numbers. The success of the first tunnelling companies formed under Norton-Griffiths' command led to mining being made a separate branch of the Engineer-in-Chief's office under Major-General S.R. Rice, and the appointment of an 'Inspector of Mines' at the GHQ Saint-Omer office of the Engineer-in-Chief. A second group of tunnelling companies were formed from Welsh miners from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who were attached to the 1st Northumberland Field Company of the Royal Engineers, which was a Territorial unit. The formation of twelve new tunnelling companies, between July and October 1915, helped to bring more men into action in other parts of the Western Front. Most tunnelling companies were formed under Norton-Griffiths' leadership during 1915, and one more was added in 1916. On 10 September 1915, the British government sent an appeal to Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to raise tunnelling companies in the Dominions of the British Empire. On 17 September, New Zealand became the first Dominion to agree the formation of a tunnelling unit. The New Zealand Tunnelling Company arrived at Plymouth on 3 February 1916 and was deployed to the Western Front in northern France.Anthony Byledbal, \\"New Zealand Tunnelling Company: Chronology\\" (online ), access date 5 July 2015 A Canadian unit was formed from men on the battlefield, plus two other companies trained in Canada and then shipped to France. Three Australian tunnelling companies were formed by March 1916, resulting in 30 tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers being available by the summer of 1916. Unit history Formation 176th Tunnelling Company was formed at Lestrem in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Nord-Pas-de- Calais region of France in April 1915, and moved soon after to the Neuve Chapelle area, facing Bois du Biez. From its formation until the end of the war the company served under First Army.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 19. Givenchy 1915 In June 1915 the company was moved to Givenchy, where it relieved 170th Tunnelling Company which had been operating there since spring 1915 to counter enemy mining activity in that sector. Cuinchy 1915 The company was next deployed in Summer 1915 on operations under the command of 2nd Division near Cuinchy, again alongside 170th Tunnelling Company and the 173rd Tunnelling Company. Givenchy 1916 176th Tunnelling Company saw action in the northern Givenchy area until it was relieved by 254th Tunnelling Company, arriving from Gallipoli, in Spring 1916. Vimy 1916 British-dug fighting tunnel in Vimy sector In April 1916, 176th Tunnelling Company moved to Neuville-Saint-Vaast near Vimy in northern France, where it remained for a considerable time. Neuville-Saint-Vaast was close to the German \\"Labyrinth\\" stronghold between Arras and Vimy and not far from Notre Dame de Lorette. British tunnellers took over mining in this area progressively from the French between February and May 1916.The Durand Group: Vimy Ridge online, access date 2016-08-03 From spring 1916, the British had deployed five tunnelling companies along the Vimy Ridge, and during the first two months of their tenure in the area, 70 mines were fired, mostly by the Germans. Between October 1915 and April 1917 an estimated 150 French, British and German charges were fired in this sector of the Western Front. In March 1916, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company had taken over this sector of the Western Front between Roclincourt and √âcurie from the French 7/1 compagnie d'ing√©nieurs territoriaux. On 29 March 1916, the New Zealanders exchanged position with the 185th Tunnelling Company and moved to Roclincourt-Chantecler, a kilometre south of their old sector. At the same time, the 172nd Tunnelling Company was deployed in the Neuville-Saint-Vaast sector along with the 176th and 185th Tunnelling Companies. 172nd Tunnelling Company was relieved in this area by the 2nd Australian Tunnelling Company in May 1916. Also in May 1916, a German infantry attack, which forced the British back , was aimed at neutralising British mining activity by capturing the shaft entrances. From June 1916, however, the Germans withdrew many miners to work on the Hindenburg Line and also for work in coal mines in Germany. In the second half of 1916 the British constructed strong defensive underground positions, and from August 1916, the Royal Engineers developed a mining scheme to support a large-scale infantry attack on the Vimy Ridge proposed for autumn 1916, although this was subsequently postponed. After September 1916, when the Royal Engineers had completed their network of defensive galleries along most of the front line, offensive mining largely ceased although activities continued until 1917. The British gallery network beneath Vimy Ridge eventually grew to a length of . The Canadian Corps was posted to the northern part of Vimy Ridge in October 1916 and preparations for an attack were revived in February 1917. Prior to the Battle of Vimy Ridge (9‚Äì12 April 1917), the British tunnelling companies secretly laid a series of explosive charges under German positions in an effort to destroy surface fortifications before the assault.Boire (1992) pp. 22‚Äì23 The original plan had called for 17 mines and 9 Wombat charges to support the infantry attack, of which 13 (possibly 14) mines and 8 Wombat charges were eventually laid. At the same time, 19 crater groups existed along this section of the Western Front, each with several large craters.Boire (1992) p. 20 In order to assess the consequences of infantry having to advance across cratered ground after a mining attack, officers from the Canadian Corps visited La Boisselle and Fricourt where the mines on the first day of the Somme had been blown. Their reports and the experience of the Canadians at St Eloi in April 1916 ‚Äì where mines had so altered and damaged the landscape as to render occupation of the mine craters by the infantry all but impossible ‚Äì, led to the decision to remove offensive mining from the central sector allocated to the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge. Further British mines in the area were vetoed following the blowing by the Germans on 23 March 1917 of nine craters along no man's land as it was probable that the Germans were aiming to restrict an Allied attack to predictable points. The three mines already laid by 172nd Tunnelling Company were also dropped from the British plans. They were left in place after the assault and were only removed in the 1990s. Another mine, prepared by 176th Tunnelling Company against the German strongpoint known as the Pimple, was not completed in time for the attack. The gallery had been pushed silently through the clay, avoiding the sandy and chalky layers of the Vimy Ridge, but by 9 April 1917 was still short of its target. In the end, two mines were blown before the attack, while three mines and two Wombat charges were fired to support the attack, including those forming a northern flank. Other units active around Vimy were 175th, 182nd, 184th and 255th Tunnelling Companies.

He served in the American Revolutionary War where he saw action at the Battle of the Saintes, the French Revolutionary Wars where he fought at the Glorious First of June and the Battle of Groix, and the Napoleonic Wars where he served in North-American waters. Byron was in command of HMS Belvidera when she was attacked by a squadron of heavy frigates in one of the first actions of the 1812 Anglo-American War. Personal life Richard Byron was born in 1769 to the Honourable Richard Byron, rector of Haughton, and Mary, n√©e Farmer. He was the nephew of Admiral John Byron. On 23 September 1803, he married Sarah Sykes, the daughter of a navy agent and the sister of John Sykes (1773‚Äì1858), later to be Vice-admiral John Sykes. They had four sons. Byron died in Leatherhead on 2 September 1837, aged 68. His wife outlived him by several years, passing in August 1861.Tracy (p.68) Early career The Battle of the Saintes by Thomas Whitcombe, painted 1783 In October 1781 he was listed as a volunteer aboard his cousin's ship, HMS Proserpine and when his cousin, George Byron, was given command of the newly built, HMS Andromache in January 1782, the young Richard went with him as an Able seaman.Tracy (p.67) Andromache sailed for the West Indies, arriving in the Dominica Channel on 9 April 1782 and was thus present at the Battle of the Saintes. Returning to home waters, Andromache joined Lord Howe's fleet in The Channel and later participated in the relief of Gibraltar.Winfield (p.213) On 2 June 1784, still serving under his cousin, Byron was promoted to midshipman of HMS Druid, searching for smugglers along the Devon and Cornish coast. Byron served for a while under Druid's next captain, Joseph Ellison, who joined the ship in March 1785, then in November 1788, Byron rejoined his cousin who was at that time in command of the 36-gun Phoenix. Phoenix sailed for the East Indies where she took part in actions against Tippoo Sahib. During the campaign, the boat carrying George Byron overturned and, severely injured, he was sent home to England, where he later died. Richard Byron, who had been serving as master's mate, then transferred to HMS Crown, under the flag of Rear-admiral William Cornwallis, as a midshipman once more. Cornwallis later moved his flag to Minerva and was soon after followed by Byron. On 1 October 1792, Byron was promoted to lieutenant of the 36-gun HMS Perseverance. When Perseverance returned to home waters in July the following year, Byron was on leave until he was appointed to Rear-admiral Caldwell's flagship, Impregnable in October 1793. Byron was aboard Impregnable when she fought in a fleet action on 1 June 1794. Glorious day The British and French fleets on the morning of 1 June 1794 Admiral Lord Howe's Channel Fleet was in the Atlantic Ocean, when on 1 June 1794, it intercepted and engaged the French Atlantic Fleet, under the commanded of Rear-Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse at latitude 44¬∞ 26' 58\\" north, longitude 13¬∞ 03' 27\\" west, approximately south-west of Ushant.Willis (p.28) The battle was the last of three engagements between these fleets, that occurred over five days.Willis (p.39) Howe's initial plan was for his 25 ships to independently turn and cut the enemy line of 26 ships, so that each British ship passed between the stern and bow of a different pair of French ships, raking both. Once through the line, the British ships would turn and engage their opposite number on the leeward side thus preventing any possibility of an escape.Willis (pp.57‚Äì58) Only a few captains followed Howe's orders however, either because they had misunderstood or had willfully chosen to disobey, or they had been prevented from doing so by damage incurred in the previous actions. Despite this the British were able to capture seven ships, although one almost immediately sank, while the rest of the French fleet was so badly damaged it was forced to retire.James (Vol. I) (p.153) The British suffered 290 killed and 858 wounded during this and the encounters which took place on 28 and 29 May. French accounts give their losses as 3,000 killed or wounded; however as the dead and wounded on board the six captured ships amounted to 690 and 580 respectively, plus the 300 or so estimated to have gone down with the seventh, British estimates are much higher some claiming 7,000.Willis (p.75)James (Vol. I) (pp.152‚Äì153) Impregnable was eighth in line and one of those that did not engage as Howe intended. James (Vol. I) (p.147) She had seven of her crew members killed and 24 wounded.Willis (p.74) After the battle, Byron served aboard the 100-gun, HMS Queen Charlotte and in her took part in another large engagement off the island of Groix a year later. Action off Groix An engraving of the action on 23 June by Robert Dodd, from the original by Captain Alexander Becher, RN. Having received word that Villaret had left Brest, the Channel Fleet of 14 battleships, by then under Alexander Hood, set off in pursuit. On 22 June, the British fleet was at , when at 03:30 the 12 ships-of-the-line of the French Atlantic Fleet were spotted. Hood sent his fastest ships, the Sans-Pareil, Orion, Colossus, Irresistible, Valiant, and Russel, ahead.James (Vol. I) (p.245) Although both fleets were affected by periods of calm, by 19:00 the leading British ships were in a position to open fire. The chase continued through the night and at 03:00 the following morning the wind began to pick up. By dawn, Queen Charlotte, which had forged ahead through superior sailing, was alongside Irresistible with the rest of the British fleet spread out behind. The French fleet by contrast had remained together, except three or four ships astern, the closest of which was some three miles ahead. By 06:00 the British were beginning to overhaul the French and there was some sporadic firing. At around 06:15, the Queen Charlotte engaged Formidable which after receiving a broadside from the passing Sans Pareil, soon struck.James (Vol. I) (p.246) The Queen Charlotte's sails and rigging had become so badly damaged that by 07:14, she was beginning to drift out of the action. She continued to fight however, firing into what ships she could and forcing the surrender of the Alexandre before leaving the battle completely. Only eight British ships, the rest being too far astern, fought with all but four ships of the French Fleet, managing to capture three before Hood called off the action. The British had 31 men killed and 113 wounded. Byron's ship, Queen Charlotte, had four of her crew killed and 32 wounded. Total French losses cannot be determined but aboard the three captured ships, there were 670 killed and wounded.James (Vol. I) (p.248) Command In September 1797, Byron joined HMS Doris then the following month he joined La Virginie, as flag-lieutenant to Hugh Christian, and in her sailed to the Cape of Good Hope. On 22 June 1798, Byron was given his first command, the brig, HMS Cornwallis but he held this position for less than a month. He did not find employment again until 12 August 1801, when he was appointed to the 18-gun , a French prize. In her he sailed to the West Indies where he served on the Jamaica station. Byron made Post-captain in August 1802 and in October the following year was due to command Inconstant, but after she was fitted out, his commission was revoked and he didn't command again until he received command of the 36-gun in February 1810. It was while in command of Belvidera that Byron became involved in one of the first conflicts of the 1812 Anglo-American war.James (Vol.VI) (p.66) Anglo-American war On 23 June 1812 Belvidera was 35 miles south-west of the Nantucket Shoals where she was waiting to ambush the French privateer Marengo. There an American squadron spotted Belvidera. The United States had declared war on Britain four days previously but word had not yet reached Byron, who nevertheless prudently moved away. James (Vol. VI) (pp.80‚Äì81) The heavy frigates President and United-States, together with the 18-pounder 36-gun frigate Congress, the 20-gun ship-sloop Hornet and the 18-gun brig-sloop Argus, gave chase. The chase of the Belvidera After ten hours in pursuit, the leading American ship, President, had closed to 600 yards and began firing. One of Belvidera's guns was hit and the resulting explosion killed two seaman and wounded three others. Belvidera returned fire and a running battle ensued. Ten minutes later, President was forced to suspend her attack when one of her guns burst, killing or injuring 16 of her crew.James (Vol.VI) (p.82) When President renewed her attack she did so by bringing her starboard guns to bear, which caused considerable damage to Belvideras sails and rigging. While repairs were carried out, Byron personally supervised the chase guns, despite having sustained a wound to his leg. By 17:00, President had closed the gap to 400 yards and again put her helm over in order to give Belvidera a second broadside.James (Vol.VI) (p.82) President continued alternating between her chase and maindeck guns and only once did Belvidera yaw in an attempt to use hers, but President matched the manoeuvre and Belvidera was forced to turn back without firing. At 18:25 it became apparent to Byron that President was now in a position overhaul her opponent and bring her to close action. Byron therefore gave the order to jettison four of Belvideras anchors. This loss of weight, together with President's constant yawing, allowed Belvidera to put so much water between them that President ceased firing. Congress however was still in the chase, overtaking President at 18:30 and opening fire. Finding her shots falling short however, she too stopped firing soon after. Belvidera continued to shed weight, throwing her water and boats over the side in an attempt to put distance between her and her pursuers, and by 20:00, she was two miles ahead of the nearest American ship.James (Vol.VI) (p.83) Having by this time repaired much of the damage that had been done, Byron ordered the studding sails out and set course for Halifax. The American squadron gave up the chase and returned to their original mission, searching for the Jamaican merchant fleet, not realising that Belvidera had, over the last 15 hours, led them further away from it.James (Vol.VI) (pp.83‚Äì84) Belvidera arrived in Halifax on 27 June with a number of American prizes she had managed to capture en route. On hearing of the altercation, Admiral Sawyer despatched the sloop to New York to demand an explanation. Once confirmation was received, the schooner sailed to England with news of the war, arriving on 25 July.James (Vol.VI) (p.84) Constitution Constitution employs boats and anchors to pull away from the pursuing British squadron On 14 July 1812, Byron, still in command of Belvidera, was part of a squadron under Philip Broke which also included: Shannon, Aeolus, Guerri√®re and the 64-gun Africa. The squadron was cruising off the coast of New Jersey when at 15:00, on 16 July, a strange sail was spotted. Having received word two days previous, that an American squadron was in the vicinity, Broke ordered his ships to investigate. The light winds caused the pursuit to drag on into the night when the British ships lost sight of each other and their quarry.James (Vol.VI) (p.92) At about 22:00 Guerri√®re had relocated the ship and by 03:00 the following morning, closed to within half a mile. When Guerri√®re spotted two other frigates which did not appear to answer her signals correctly, she erroneously believed them to be part of the American squadron, and veered away but the two frigates were in fact Belvidera and Aeolus. The heavy American frigate, USS Constitution, it was later discovered, was sailing alone and the result of Guerri√®re's course change was that when daylight came, the nearest British ship was the Belvidera four miles away. Guerri√®re was a little astern of Belvidera and, Shannon and Aeolus two miles further back from her. The larger, slower Africa was already a long way astern of these two and the distance was widening all the time as the smaller, faster frigates pushed on. By 05:30 the wind had died completely and Constitution's captain, Isaac Hull, ordered the boats launched to take her in tow. In order to stay in touch, Byron had to imitate the manoeuvre and ignore the danger to his boats' crews from Constitution's five 24-pound stern chasers. Within a few minutes, the other British frigate captains had also begun to tow their vessels. Just before 07:00, Constitution entered shallower water and this allowed her crew to row out a kedge anchor to winch up to. This was abandoned shortly after 09:00 when the wind picked up and Belvidera began to gain ground.James (Vol.VI) (pp.92‚Äì93) Constitution was thus forced to jettison some cargo in order to maintain her advantage. When the wind dropped again, Byron ordered his boats to row out and began warping using two anchors alternately. By 14:00 this had resulted in Belvidera getting close enough to exchange fire with its chase but with little effect on either side. An hour later the breeze increased and Constitution once more began to pull away.James (Vol.VI) (p.93) By daybreak on 18 July, Belvidera was four miles behind and the next British ship a further six miles. At 09:00, an American merchant vessel was spotted and in a ruse de guerre to lure the ship closer, Belvidera hoisted American colours. In response, Constitution raised British colours and the merchantman veered off. The wind held all day and by 16:00 Constitution had increased her lead to seven miles, and by dawn the next day, she had doubled this distance. The British continued their pursuit until 08:30 when they headed off to the north-east. Later life Byron retired from the navy on 25 October 1814. He was made a Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath (CB) on 4 June 1815. Promoted Rear-admiral 10 January 1837, Byron died 2 September that year.

His works have cased walls in Cairo, Luxor, Alexandria, Beirut, Frankfurt, Berlin, Amsterdam and Brussels.Ammar Abo Bakr. Tea After Twelve, issue #03. Ammar Abo Bakr was born on February 14, 1980.Facebook, Ammar Abo Bakr. Accessed on April 28, 2015. He attended Luxor Institute of Fine Arts from 1996 and 2001 where he studied painting. Beginning in 2004, Abo Bakr began researching the Egyptian people, looking for inspiration for his artwork. In addition to creating his own graffiti pieces, he was a professor at the Luxor Institute of Fine Arts where he attended school.  His Work Ammar's work depicts the history of Egypt, Islamic culture, and the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Some of his most well known murals were on Mohamed Mahmoud Street which is close to Tahrir Square where the January 25 revolution occurred. His work is inspired by what is going on in the country at the time and by what society wants. Since his work often goes against the government, it can be dangerous when creating these works or murals. He sometimes has to take time off in a certain location because he knows of many family and friends who have gone to prison. During and shortly after the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Ammar was busy putting graffiti on anything he could find. Other artists and activists were also writing on public spaces, so not only were they sending messages to the government, but they also were keeping up a dialogue among themselves and responding to other artists' graffiti work. His work on Mohamed Mahmoud Street was especially important because this street connects Tahrir Square and the Ministry of the Interior. The graffiti on this street served as a \\"newspaper\\" of what was happening during the revolution. When writing about his work, Abo Bakr noted, \\"What we did in Egypt in recent years was not about presenting art, at least it wasn't to me: We used walls as a newspaper... Me, I was a fine arts assistant professor. I left the faculty of arts to report on the revolution in the city‚Äôs walls.\\" In 2012, Ammar, along with other artists started the \\"No Walls\\" campaign. This campaign was aiming to cover with graffiti all of the concrete barricades that had been put up by the government.Cairo's graffiti revolution. CBS News, Accessed on April 28, 2015. The government put barricades up in neighborhoods, which were not only a visual sign of oppression but also inconvenienced the community members because they had to navigate through the barricades. Along with famous artists, many community members helped paint the walls. There were intricate murals or simple paintings of the continuation of the street behind the barricades. The goal of the campaign was to use trompe l‚Äôoeil to artistically transform the restrictive barriers put in place by Egypt's Interior Ministry, in order to make it appear as if they were not there. Ammar is strongly connected with everyday Egyptian people. He credits them for giving him his inspiration and creativity.Ammar Abo Bakr, graffiti artist. Slow Words, Accessed on April 28, 2015. He also believes that the art in Luxor and Cairo should remain out of galleries because that limits who sees it and because art is constantly changing.

Chouliarakis was praised by Thomas Wieser, the president of the EU's Economic and Financial Committee, as being a \\"gifted negotiator\\", despite never truly fighting for Greece and even threatened to go over the other side if he didn't get his way. He has been called \\"the invisible negotiator\\" by some of the Athens media due to being notoriously media-shy. The Wall Street Journal described him as a \\"constructive interlocutor\\".

His responsibilities included overseeing the national accounts office, \\"a post seen as critical to achieving the ambitious fiscal targets set by the bailout programme\\" according to the Financial Times.

Chouliarakis has also resumed the role of Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors (SOE), and in that capacity is a member of the Board of Directors of the Greek Public Debt Management Agency.

In the 1861 University Match against Oxford University, he took three Oxford wickets for 19 runs in the first innings and six, again for 19 runs, in the second, to lead Cambridge to victory after the team had trailed on the first innings; the second innings figures were the best of his first-class career. He was also successful in the 1862 University Match, taking the first four Oxford wickets in the first innings to reduce the Oxford score to 9 for 4, though he took only one further wicket in the match; he also top-scored in the Cambridge first innings, making an unbeaten 32 in his accustomed position as No 11 in the batting order. After the university cricket season was over, he played only one further match, for a Gentlemen of the North side. Salter graduated from Cambridge University in 1863 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.

She was prosecuted along with seven other individuals involved. In December 2013, Sabahi was acquitted of her convictions, overturning her conviction and previous fine.

The Sylvan Grove Theater and Columns, also known as the Sylvan Grove Theater or simply the Sylvan Theater, is a sylvan theater located on the University of Washington campus in Seattle, Washington. Within the theater are four tall Ionic columns from the original University building downtown, constructed in 1861. They are some of the oldest-standing architectural pieces in Seattle. It has been called \\"one of the most beautiful places on campus.\\" The columns were named \\"Loyalty\\", \\"Industry\\", \\"Faith\\", and \\"Efficiency\\" (LIFE) by University Comptroller Herbert T. Condon and Edmond S. Meany, head of the History Department. History The original University of Washington building in downtown Seattle officially opened on September 16, 1861. It had a portico with four Ionic columns made of hand-fluted cedar. In 1908, as the building was about to be demolished, Edmond S. Meany saved the columns, intending that they should be used in the construction of the new campus. From 1911 through 1920, the columns stood in the Quad, near Savery, Denny, and Raitt Halls. Eventually it became clear that the Greek columns could not be integrated into the University design plan, which specified Gothic architecture for the buildings on upper campus. A student design competition was organized and was won by a sophomore, Marshall W. Gill, the son of Seattle Mayor Hiram Gill. In 1921, the columns were moved to their current location in Sylvan Grove. They are maintained by the university's Facility Services, which last repaired them in 2008.

It was released in 1985 by Recycled Records. The album was sold as an LP record with no cover or protective packaging, such that the damage from shipping, storing, and playing the record becomes a part of the work. Background and composition Marclay recorded Record Without a Cover in New York City with a four-track machine. The album has only one untitled track, which opens with a ten-minute section of silence.Ferguson 2003, p. 98. During this period, the record contains audio artifacts from multiple vinyl records being played, a sound that gradually grows louder. Marclay then introduces drums and bells, which leads into samples including classical music, a tango, various sound effects, and \\"Caravan\\" by Duke Ellington. Toward the end of the record, the clicks and pops from the introduction interrupt the samples for two minutes. Record Without a Cover was sold without any packaging, such that the wear and tear on it gradually transformed the sound of each copy. The record's reverse side is printed with instructions not to \\"store in a protective package\\", which gradually becomes less legible as the record is played repeatedly. The record's transformation can be interpreted as a form of spontaneous composition, with each copy becoming a distinct performance. Marclay wanted to ensure that \\"you can't ignore the medium\\", and the evolving sound of the record blurs what he originally recorded with the way in which the record has physically changed.Kelly 2009, p. 173. Discussing the impact of Michael Snow's films on his work, Marclay cited Wavelength as another piece in which the audience moves \\"between being fooled and being aware of the illusion.\\"Kelly 2011, pp. 150‚Äì1. He noted that both artists focused on their medium's technical elements to draw the audience's attention to it. Music journalist Alan Licht offered Bruce Conner's films as a comparison. Licht drew a parallel between the silent beginning of Record Without a Cover and Conner's 1958 collage film A Movie, which opens with an extended cut of its title card. Release and legacy Marclay promoted the record's release with a performance at Hallwalls. With the support of the Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center's performance program, Record Without a Cover was originally released in 1985 by Recycled Records.Dworkin 2013, p. 148. It was distributed through the New Music Distribution Service. The album sold several thousand copies. It has since become a collector's item, particularly among vinyl aficionados. Japanese label Locus Solus reissued Record Without a Cover in 1999. The reissue was pressed on white vinyl, making it noisier than the original.Criqui 2014, p. 125. The Wire included the album in its list of \\"100 Records That Set the World on Fire\\". Tank magazine characterized Record Without a Cover as \\"one of the most important moments in the history of 20th century sonic art\\", likening its \\"conceptual neatness\\" to John Cage's composition 4‚Ä≤33‚Ä≥.

He started the season on the sidelines after being diagnosed with glandular fever during the 2017 season pre-season. In round 12 he made his debut for Collingwood, recording 16 disposals against Melbourne in a four- point loss. Personal life Brown is the son of former Collingwood captain, Gavin Brown, and brother of his team-mate Tyler Brown. His sister, Tarni Brown, was selected for the 2020 AFL Women's (AFLW) academy and will be eligible for the 2020 AFL Women's draft as a potential father-daughter pick for Collingwood. He was educated at Marcellin College, where he played Australian rules football and basketball, and was awarded the Terrance Cleary Memorial Award for Sporting Excellence. Brown is studying for a Bachelor of Arts at Deakin University.

After coming to power, Hitler moved to make himself tax-exempt. Early life Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 and grew up in Braunau am Inn, a small Austrian village on the border with Germany. His family was rather poor and three of his siblings ‚ÄîGustav, Ida, and Otto‚Äî died in infancy due to common childhood diseases. Hitler's father, Alois, unsuccessfully tried to establish a farm, and his wife, Klara, was a housewife. In 1913, Hitler received legacies from his deceased relatives and decided to move to Munich, a large German city located in Bavaria. Artistic ambitions The Courtyard of the Old Residency in Munich, painting by Hitler from 1914 Once in Munich, Hitler lived a Bohemian life alongside his childhood friend August Kubizek. The two shared a room rented from a local tailor. Hitler painted pictures, watercolors and copied postcards and sold them to tourists for a small profit. In 1907, he applied to join Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, but was rejected due to a \\"lack of talent\\". In 1908, Hitler tried again, but was once again rejected. Shortly afterwards, Hitler ran out of money and was forced to live in homeless shelters and men's hostels. Mein Kampf sales Hitler wrote his political manifesto and autobiography Mein Kampf (\\"My Struggle\\") in Landsberg prison while serving a sentence for high treason committed during the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923. Mein Kampf was printed by the Franz Eher Nachfolger publishing house and largely ignored at first, but sales began to boom in the late 1920s and early 1930s as economic depression and social unrest troubled Germany, factors which significantly boosted Hitler's popularity. After Hitler came to power in 1933, couples who married during the Nazi state were given a copy as a wedding gift. The book eventually became a best-seller within Nazi Germany, selling almost twelve million copies by the war's end. Nazi Party funds While hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic had crippled the German economy and plunged millions of German workers into unemployment, Hitler and his party received lavish donations from wealthy benefactors at home and abroad. The iconic American car maker and anti-Semite Henry Ford was reported to be one of the foreign supporters. Helene Bechstein, part of a rich aristocratic family who sold pianos, supported Hitler financially. The Ruhr steel barons Fritz Thyssen and Gustav Krupp donated almost five million Reichsmarks to the Nazi Party over the course of the war. The Berghof, Hitler's private retreat, was renovated at a massive cost, all of it paid for with Nazi Party donations Much of the party's income from donations was used to pay for Hitler's private projects, such as the Berghof and Eagle's Nest. He caused a minor controversy within leading elements of the party when he, in 1925, purchased a luxury Mercedes- Benz and a chauffeur to drive it for a total expenditure of 20,000 Reichsmarks. After examining Hitler's tax records from the Bavarian State Archives in Munich, economics journalist Wolfgang Zdral said, \\"He's driving a Mercedes, which cost incredible amounts of money at the time, can afford to go on travels and has enough money to finance his propaganda appearances. All of this is financed through a system of slush-funds, essentially the donation of larger and smaller benefactors\\". Tax evasion Throughout his rise to power, Hitler neglected to pay taxes on his income and allowances. In 1934, one year after becoming Chancellor, the tax office of Munich sent Hitler a fine of 405,494.00 Reichsmarks for not paying taxes nor properly declaring his income. He was given only eight days to pay off this debt. The new Chancellor responded by ordering a state secretary of the ministry of finance to intervene, which resulted in Hitler becoming tax-free. The head of the Munich tax office declared, \\"all tax reports delivering substance for a tax obligation by the F√ºhrer are annulled from the start. The F√ºhrer is therefore tax-exempt\\". After the death of President Paul von Hindenburg, Hitler took over his office and claimed his salary as well. In his last will and testament, Hitler said regarding his personal earnings, \\"what I own, as far as it is worth anything, belongs to the party. Should this no longer exist, the German state. Should the state also be destroyed, there is no need for a further decision on my part\\".

Biography Gertrude Bugler was born in 1897 in Dorchester, Dorset (the hometown of Thomas Hardy). Gertrude was the daughter of Augusta, a local milkmaid who had attracted the attention of the young Thomas Hardy, not yet a writer. Hardy had been too shy to approach Augusta but had used her as the model for the heroine in his classic novel \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" in 1890. Hardy then moved to London to pursue his successful writing career and did not see her again until he returned to Dorchester in 1913. Hardy, then age 72, had returned to his old home to work on dramatizations of his novels. By this time Augusta had been married and was running a hotel where Hardy set up house and used as a headquarters for his theatrical troupe called The Hardy Players, made up of local amateur actors. Augusta's daughter Gertrude, then 16, was an aspiring actress who joined the troupe. Hardy was quickly smitten with the beautiful young girl who reportedly bore a strong resemblance to her mother, and he cast her in a role in \\"The Woodlanders\\". The play was staged locally but drama critics who came from London to preview the play gave Gertrude glowing reviews for her angelic beauty and her naturalistic acting style. Returning in 1921, Hardy cast her in a lead role in \\"Return of the Native\\" to once again rave reviews. In 1924, he would adopt \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" and once again cast Gertrude with similar rave results. Hardy made plans to take the play to London with Gertrude as the lead role. Hardy's wife Florence Dugdale was controlling and had been jealous of Hardy's affection for Gertrude even though he was at that point 83 years old and Gertude was 26 and married. Florence put her foot down and forbade the bringing of Gertrude and the Buglers to the London production, much to the disappointment not only of Hardy but also those critics who had seen Gertrude play the role. After Hardy's death in 1928, Florence, feeling some guilt over preventing Gertrude from a chance at performing on the London stage, gave her the role of Tess in a 1929 London production at The Duke of York's Theatre which garnered the expected lavish praise for her sensitive performance and natural charm. However, \\"The London Stage 1920-1929: A Calendar of Productions, Performers, and Personnel\\" states that the reviews were decidedly mixed. At any rate after enjoying her moment in the sun, Gertrude, now married with a daughter and an ailing mother (who later died in 1940) and a younger sister Norrie, simply turned her back on acting and returned to Dorchester where she lived quietly and happily, living to the old age of 95. Gertrude later wrote about her experiences in \\"Personal recollections of Thomas Hardy\\" published by The Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society in 1962. Her younger sister Norrie Woodhall (another aspiring actress who also stayed in Dorchester) was still alive in 2008 and for her 100th birthday staged a production of \\"Tess\\" for the internet. Norrie Woodhall died in 2011 at the age of 105 as the last member of the Hardy Players.

Responsibilities In child welfare, ACS contracts with private nonprofit organizations to support and stabilize families at risk of a crisis through preventive services, and provides foster care services for children not able to safely remain at home. On any given day ACS is serving nearly 25,000 children and their families via community-based prevention programs. ACS has reduced the number of NYC children in foster care to the lowest level in decades. At the end of CY 2018, there were approximately 8,200 children in the NYC foster care system, representing a continued decline over the past two years, in the face of foster care increases nationally. Each year, the agency's Division of Child Protection conducts more than 55,000 investigations of suspected child abuse or neglect. In juvenile justice, ACS manages and funds services including detention and placement, intensive community-based alternatives for youth, and support services for families. In early care and education, ACS provides vouchers for children eligible for subsidized care. In 2017, ACS created an entirely new division within the agency called \\"Child and Family Well-Being.\\" This division focuses on a primary prevention approach and aims to engage families before they ever reach the child welfare system, with resources and services to help them prosper. As part of the division, ACS launched three Family Enrichment Centers (FEC) in neighborhoods with the highest rate of child welfare involvement. Everything about each FEC‚Äîfrom the name, to the physical layout, to the services offered‚Äîwas co-developed with families and the community. The FECs are open to all families in their communities and provide a range of services that support healthy child development. History When the agency was first created under Mayor John Lindsay's administration, it was known as the Bureau of Child Welfare (or BCW). In 1969, Lindsay placed it under the Human Resources Administration, and changed its name to Special Services for Children. Mayor Ed Koch later renamed it the Child Welfare Administration in the 1980s, shortly after the death of a 6-year-old in the West Village. In 1995, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani made the agency separate of the Human Resources Administration and renamed it to the Administration for Children's Services. In 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio appointed David A. Hansell as Commissioner. Immediately following Hansell's appointment, he conducted a top-to-bottom review of the agency to examine every aspect of child protective work. Growth The agency has been expanded repeatedly, after incidents in which children were killed by their parents. In 1995, after Giuliani had previously refused to expand the agency, he created 200 new jobs in response to Elisa Izquierdo being killed by her mentally ill mother. Mayor Michael Bloomberg eliminated 169 of those jobs in 2003. However, in 2006, Bloomberg increased the size of the agency, in the wake of the murder of Nixzmary Brown by her stepfather. The death of Nixzmary was also followed by a spike in abuse reports, which greatly increased pressure on the agency. In 2014, the agency saw even more expansion after three children died; Mayor Bill de Blasio hired 362 new staff members, which drastically reduced case workers' work load. As of 2019, Commissioner Hansell hired over 1,100 new child protective specialists. With more frontline staff on board, Commissioner Hansell successfully reduced the average investigative caseload to 10.1 cases per caseworker during the first four months of FY 2019, well below the nationally recommended standard of 12 and lower than almost every other jurisdiction in New York State. As of 2019, all frontline child-protective staff were provided with portable tablets that allow workers to conduct clearances, obtain case history, and access other critical information in real time while out in the field  Initiatives  Safe Medication Campaign: In Fall 2017, ACS launched a citywide Safe Medication campaign to provide families with tools to help ensure that medications and potentially dangerous household items are stored out of children's reach. As part of this campaign, ACS partnered with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop informational palm cards and promotional posters to raise awareness of the dangers of unsafe medication storage. In addition, our child protection frontline staff distributes medication lock boxes and bags to families engaged with ACS as needed to help keep medication out of children's reach, and ACS also supplied lock boxes to our provider partners to distribute to other families in need. Safe Sleep Campaign: A significant proportion of child fatalities in NYC‚Äîapproximately 50 each year‚Äîare attributed to unsafe sleep practices. To help prevent sleep-related injuries, ACS is partnering with NYC Health + Hospitals (H+H) to put Safe Sleep information directly into the hands of new parents. In 2019, ACS announced that parents who give birth in any of H+H's eleven delivering hospitals will receive a toolkit that includes a onesie with safe sleep instructions, a sleep sack (wearable blanket), crib netting to protect from household pests, as well as educational materials about best practices for infant safe sleep, including an informational video entitled, 16 ‚ÄúBreath of Life: The How and Why of Safe Sleep,‚Äù which is also accessible on ACS's website. Foster Care Strategic Blueprint: In 2016, ACS developed and issued the ACS Foster Care Strategic Blueprint (FY 2016-FY 2018). The Blueprint identified key priorities and strategies for improving case practice and results across the foster care continuum‚Äîfrom family reunification to kinship placement to adoption to supporting older youth in care. In 2018, the next phase of this work was in the five-year ACS Foster Care Strategic Blueprint (FY2019-FY2023). The five-year plan builds upon the progress made under the 2016-2018 blueprint, and is informed by the recommendations of the NYC Interagency Foster Care Task Force, the findings from a major review of the cases of 2,200 children, the findings from the ACS Youth Experience Survey of youth ages 13+, an examination of older youth permanency, an intensive analysis of foster care performance data and input from a range of stakeholders including youth, parents, providers, advocates and others. The NYC Child Tattoo Eradication Project and Network: The NYC Child Tattoo Eradication Project and Network is composed of leaders within the ACS Office of Child Trafficking Prevention and Policy, the ACS Agency Medical Director and its Office of Older Youth, along with medical professionals with prior experience in tattoo removal. The network was first developed when ACS learned of a vulnerable teen whose pimp's initials had been tattooed onto her forehead. Seeking a solution that would provide physical and emotional support to the teen and to others in similar situations, ACS professionals sought the expertise and contributions of medical professionals with prior experience in tattoo removal. The providers who expressed interest in contributing their time and expertise joined the Network. The NYC Child Tattoo Eradication Network is operated by ACS‚Äô Office of Child Trafficking Prevention and Policy, with several goals in mind. First, to ensure that all ACS involved youth have the opportunity to safely remove exploiter or gang brandings. Second, to reduce trauma by connecting medical providers with case planners and youth to provide an opportunity for shared discussion of situational understanding and to provide tattoo removal in a trauma informed, and physically and emotionally safe environment. Third, to provide training to medical providers on trafficking and gang dynamics to enhance their knowledge of, and empathy for branded youth. Close to Home: The Close to Home program allows young people found to need a period of out-of-home placement by the Family Court to be placed in residential programs closer to their families and communities. Under Close to Home, young people receive therapeutic services at small group homes in or near the five boroughs where they are close to resources that can support their treatment and transition back into their communities. ACSConnectME: ACSConnectME is a mobile website for youth in foster care, foster parents, adoptive parents, families and child welfare professionals. The site provides users with greater access to information about services and resources across ACS, other government agencies and more. Users can search for the services that are right for them (education, housing, parenting support, etc.) in the location in which they reside. ACSConnectMe is the brainchild of a former foster youth who pitched the idea at a NYC Foster Care Technology & Policy Hackathon sponsored by ACS, after explaining the need to more easily access resources about education, housing and more all in one place. Budget ACS‚Äô Fiscal 2020 Executive Budget totals $2.66 billion.

He is the leading advocate for the call for adherence to constitutional legitimacy (1951 Constitution) in confronting the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. Early life Ben Ghalbon was born in Benghazi, Libya in 1947. He studied at \\"Al-Ameer\\" School, then in Benghazi High school. He followed his family‚Äôs tradition in trade and commerce and later in construction between 1968 and his departure from Libya to Britain in 1978 where he took up residence, with his wife and four children, in Manchester where his two younger brothers Hisham and Ali studied. Position Against the Gaddafi Regime His first confrontation with Gaddafi‚Äôs regime was in September 1974 when he expressed his objection to the regime's introduction of the unprecedented policy of compulsory conscription for girls. He saw this as a calculated first step towards humiliating the Libyan people and undermining the traditions upon which Libya's conservative society was built. In the early hours of 8 September 1974 he carried out an armed attack on the barracks where the female students were detained in an attempt to release his sister who was a student at the Faculty of Law in Benghazi University. Of the three young male soldiers guarding the barracks the attack left one dead and two injured. This made him the first civilian to raise arms against the military junta ruling the country since 1 September 1969.\\"Mohamed Ben Ghalbon; the bullet that shaped the start of the resistance\\". Al-Kalima Newspaper, Issue (144), 09 February 2014. He was subsequently arrested, detained and tortured, first in civilian then in military prisons in the period between September 1974 and early 1976 when he was acquitted of the charges against him due to lack of sufficient evidence to indict him. The judicial system was still free of the dominance of the junta‚Äôs security apparatus in Libya in those days. He was released when the authorities were satisfied that he was not part of an organised group who posed a serious threat. Despite the quashing of the charges against him Ben Ghalbon made contact with the soldier‚Äôs family as soon as the threat of political and security reprisals was negated with the collapse of the Gaddafi regime in 2011. He reached a satisfactory settlement in accordance with Islamic tradition, concluded an official judicial reconciliation and was granted a full pardon from the deceased's family who acknowledged that the attack was an act of rebellion against the regime and not aimed at their son. During his first two years of exile in the UK, he participated in the clandestine political resistance which was in its early stages by lending support to the Libyan student union which his brothers Hisham and Ali were founding members of. He also communicated with the Libyan opposition groups which had just begun taking shape. He subsequently reached the conclusion that any effective political endeavour must be public, and that it must begin from the end of the \\"independence era\\". He believed the first step must be to undo the offence to the country's true leader and legitimate monarch, King Idris I, raise the true Libyan flag (the tricolour) and adopt the Libyan constitution which led to the birth of the Libyan state on 24 December 1951, as the source to constitutional legitimacy. And not to endorse its annulment by the Junta. In August 1981 he visited King Idris in his exile in Cairo and reiterated the pledge of allegiance to his majesty as historical leader of the Libyan people's struggle for independence and national unity and as a symbol of legality for the nation. He gained the King‚Äôs blessing to establish the Libyan Constitutional Union (LCU).

The LCU called upon all Libyan opposition spectra to rally around the King in order to return to the constitutional legitimacy of 1951 and embarrass the international community into the cessation of dealings with a regime that usurped power by force with neither a public mandate nor constitutional authority, while the legal representative of that constitutional legitimacy was very much alive with sectors of his people are calling for his return. Mr. Ben Ghalbon and his family immediately became targets of Gaddafi's assassination teams notoriously known in the 1980s as \\"hit squads\\".‚ÄúHit-list Kids study in terror‚Äù, Daily Mirror, 30 October 1981 Gaddafi openly labelled his political opponents \\"stray dogs\\" and ordered their \\"physical liquidation\\" wherever they may be.‚ÄúFamily of six on Gaddafi‚Äôs List of Death‚Äù, Manchester Evening News 29 October 1981 He continued his opposition to Gaddafi's regime and propagating constitutional awareness amongst the Libyan people. He again became a target during the regime's wave of terrorist acts which began in the UK on 11 March 1984 with the two bombings in London and Manchester, and reached its deadly peak on 17 April 1984 with the murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher with bullets fired from the Libyan Embassy in London while she was on duty organising a peaceful protest by Libyan opponents of the regime outside the Embassy in St. James Square. Mr. Ben Ghalbon and his family were placed under 24 hours armed police protection for several weeks since the beginning of the bombing campaign.‚ÄúBrothers knew a death squad was closing in on them‚Äù ‚Äì The Daily Mail, 21 February 1985. Their lives returned to normality and the children resumed school only after diplomatic relations between the UK and Libya were severed on 23 April 1984 and England was totally rid of Gaddafi‚Äôs agents. His Relationship with King Idris I and Queen Fatima Queen Fatima Ben Ghalbon had a strong relationship with King Idris until his majesty‚Äôs death on 25 May 1983, and with Queen Fatima whom he and his family served and defended until her final hours. Both he and his brother Hisham were by her bed side in the hospital when she died on 3 October 2009. In coordination with the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Libya Prince Al-Hassan Al-Rida Al-Sanussi, who was receiving medical care in the UK, he launched an intense humanitarian media campaign to publicise the Prince‚Äôs plight and bring to the attention of Arab Royalties the severe hardship he was suffering as a result of Gaddafi's callas exploitation of his poor health and financial conditions. He initiated that campaign with an open letter addressed to Colonel Gaddafi which he published as a paid advert in the London The GuardianGaddafi and the Libya Crown Prince: An Open Letter to Col. Gaddafi, The Guardian, 2 April 1992. newspaper of 2 April 1992. He opened the letter by saying: \\"Misfortune brought one of the Arab noblemen to remain under your rule for more than twenty years\\" and went on to expose his cruelty and abuse of the Prince and concluded it by asking him: \\"How can a man reach this level of fiendish behaviour? And Why?\\" The story was snapped up by Arab and International media. He followed it up with press statements and interviews with Arabic and International newspapers. The campaign ended with a significant positive impact on the Prince's conditions. The First Book about King Idris Eric Armar Vully de Candole, CBE, who held the post of Her Britannic Majesty's Resident, Cyrenaica, wrote a unique book \\"The Life and Times of King Idris of Libya\\", the nearest thing to a biography of the late King. When he failed to find a publisher to publish and distribute the book he published it privately in a 250 copy run as a tribute to his lifetime friend. In 1989 Mr. Ben Ghalbon re-published it in both English and Arabic language after reaching an agreement with the author's heirs and enhancing it with footnotes, appendices and a large number of photos. He distributed it free of charge in large numbers among Libyans inside and outside Libya as well as Public and University libraries and research centres worldwide, to counter the regime's relentless attacks to defame the King and his true role in shaping modern Libya, and in order to correct his history from the systematic distortion inflicted on him by the regime's propaganda machine. The case of the Jews of Libya Ben Ghalbon contributed some substantive documentary articles on the subject of the Jews of Libya and their abrupt exodus from the country following the six days war in June 1967 which he published in several serialised articles in the London-based Arabic daily Al-Hayat newspaper. He relied mainly on official British documents released after 30 years and reports of the British Military Administration (Libya) which was in charge of the country during the disturbances of 1945 and 1948, as well as authoritative Jewish sources . His contribution offered much needed source information to dispel the blur that surrounded that thorny issue, and expel many of the fallacies and fabrications which were written in the absence of a fair and neutral narrative of those events. The February Revolution Mr Ben Ghalbon was quick to lend his full support to the February revolution from its early hours. He immediately called for the need for the prompt activation of the Libyan Constitution\\"I call upon the NTC to adopt the Constitution of the Independence Era\\", Asharq Al-Awsat Newspaper, 13 June 2011. and enactment of the necessary laws from it to secure stability and the rule of law until the Libyan people are past the upheaval of the collapse of the Gaddafi regime and in a position to decide such form of body politic and system of government they may choose of their own free will. He repeatedly and openly warned of the dangers of civil war and fragmentation in the event of political vacuum no matter how short. He took a step back when the National Transitional Council ignored his call and adopted the ‚ÄúLibyan Interim constitutional declaration\\" on 3 August 2011, which he publicly described as an \\"inadequate document hastily patched up by unqualified individuals who lacked a popular mandate to bypass the nation's legitimate constitution\\". Water Conservation in the Islamic World: The ‚ÄúMoudd & Saa‚Äô‚Äù Initiative In response to the escalating water management problems in the Islamic world, Ben Ghalbon launched the ‚ÄúMoudd & Sa‚Äôa‚Äù initiative in 2001. The Initiative was based on facilitating the employment of ‚ÄúSunna‚Äù (the traditions of Prophet Mohamed) to stimulate Muslims to become environmentally responsible citizens fully aware of their duties towards water resources, and their religious and moral obligations towards its preservation. His novel concept suggested introducing minor, low cost, minimally invasive adjustments in standard modern bathrooms in order to simplify the adherence to the teachings of Prophet Mohamed, who encouraged his followers to conserve water no matter how abundant it was.Narrated by Anas : ‚ÄúThe Apostle of Allah (PBUH) performed ablution with one Moudd (of water) and performed Ghussl with a Saa' up to five Moudds‚Äù. (Sahih Muslim : Book 003, Hadith No 0635) He derived the name ‚ÄúMoudd & Saa‚Äô‚Äù from the quantities of water the prophet used for his ‚ÄúWudu & Ghussl‚Äù (minor & major ablution). In 2015, ‚ÄúMasdar Institute of Science and Technology‚Äù developed this idea by producing a low cost, easy to install and user friendly device that limits the amount of ablution water to 1200 millilitres and is fitted with a line at the 600 millilitres index to encourage adherence to the amount that sufficed the Prophet for his Wudu.

The first year samples were returned to Earth in mid-2016, panels from the second year were brought back in late 2017, and the last set ended exposure in February 2018. The last aerogels were placed inside the 'landing & return capsule' in early 2018 and ejected toward Earth for retrieval. After retrieving the aerogels, scientists are investigating the captured microparticles and tracks formed, followed by microbiological, organochemical and mineralogical analyses. Particles potentially containing microbes will be used for PCR amplification of rRNA genes followed by DNA sequencing.Tanpopo mission: Astrobiology exposure and capture experiments of microbes and micrometeoroid.

American Geophysical Union - Geospace. Larry O'Hanlon. 19 May 2017. This may support the idea that clumps greater than 0.5 millimeters of microorganisms could be one way for life to spread from planet to planet. It was also noted that glycine's decomposition was less than expected, while hydantoin's recovery was much lower than glycine. In August 2020, scientists reported that bacteria from Earth, particularly Deinococcus radiodurans bacteria, which is highly resistant to environmental hazards, were found to survive for three years in outer space, based on studies conducted on the International Space Station. These findings support the notion of panspermia, the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe, distributed in various ways, including space dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planetoids or contaminated spacecraft.

After that he spent a period in a position at the Deutsches Arch√§ologisches Institut in Damascus. A position as a member of the Mainz University Archaeological institute followed. From 1986, Siebler was an editor of the literary supplement of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In this role he looked after archaeological matters and the page on the art market. A key focus of his published work is research on Homer, Troy and Heinrich Schliemann. As FAZ editor he helped spread the findings of Manfred Korfmann, but in the end he did not endorse Korfmann's position in the Troy Controversy. After he left FAZ, he was employed by the pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim, where he managed the historical archive.

Playing career  Kouzamanis began his career in the Canadian National Soccer League in 1996 with the Toronto Supra. In his debut season with the Supra he helped the club finish third in both regular and cup standings. In the playoffs the Supra faced St. Catharines Wolves in the semi- finals, but were eliminated by a score 2-1 on goals on aggregate. At the conclusion of the season he was awarded the CNSL Rookie of the Year award. During the winter of 1995, he played with the Wichita Wings of the National Professional Soccer League. He returned to Toronto in 1997, but an injury kept him out the entire outdoor season. During the winter season he signed with the Toronto Shooting Stars, where he appeared in 30 matches and scored 15 goals. In 1998, he signed with Toronto Olympians of the newly formed Canadian Professional Soccer League. Kouzmanis had a tremendous debut season with the organization he assisted in the club's undefeated season run, and was rewarded with the CSL Golden Boot as finishing as the league's top goalscorer. In the Open Canada Cup final match he scored twice to secure the trophy for Toronto in a 3-0 victory over St. Catharines Wolves. As the Olympians reached the CPSL Championship finals there opponents were once more St. Catharines, but this time history would not repeat itself as the Wolves would go on to win the championship 4-2 on penalties. The following season, he repeated Toronto's undefeated season and achieved a treble - the first CPSL club to record this milestone. He finished third as top goal scorer in the league. In 2000, the Olympians finished once more as regular season, and Open Canada Cup champions, but were defeated by Toronto Croatia in the CPSL Championship final. For the second time in his career he was awarded the CPSL Golden Boot, and thus made history by becoming the only player to have won the award on more than one occasion. In 2001, Kouzmanis requested his release from Toronto after not being guaranteed a starting position. For the remainder of the season he signed with the Glen Shields Sun Devils and played with the franchise for two seasons. In the 2002 season he played with his brother Tom Kouzmanis, but unfortunately the club failed to reach the postseason.

The Chakma Circle encompasses parts of Rangamati Hill District and Dighinala and Rajasthali Upazilas in neighbouring Khagrachari District and Bandarban District respectively. The chiefdom's members are of Chakma descent.  Leadership  The Chakma Circle is led by a hereditary chieftain called a \\"raja,\\" whose role encompasses judicial, administrative, ceremonial, legal and social responsibilities. Political power is passed from the father to the first-born son. The incumbent chieftain is Devasish Roy (b. 10 April 1959), according to the Chakma Bijok, a compilation of the Chakma history (1876-1934 CE). The Chakma chieftain also sits on the Advisory Council for the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs and the Bandarban Hill District Council. The Chakma chieftain leads a \\"rajpunnah\\" festival.  History  Pre-colonial era The lineage of Chakma chieftains may date to the 11th century or mid-16th century. Chakma folklore and tradition ascribe the Chakma origins to the warrior castes of Bhagalpur in modern-day India. The legendary raja Bijoy Giri (c. 1630), who is believed to have migrated the ancestors of the Chakma people north of the Naf River. Through intermarriages with the Rakhine people, the Chakmas eventually converted to Buddhism. Extant historical records date to the 1700s. Following the expansion of the Mughal Empire into Chakma territory, Chakma chieftains adopted Muslim names and titles (e.g., Khan) in exchange for tributary payments.  British rule and modern era  During British rule, the Chittagong Hill Tracts were administratively divided into three circles in 1884, namely the Chakma Circle, the Bohmong Circle, and the Mong Circles, each presided over by a hereditary chief from the Chakma and Marma peoples. The circles were codified into law with the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regulations, 1900, which eased revenue collection and administrative burdens on British authorities by delegating tax collection, land administration management and social arbitration responsibilities to the chieftains. In 1901, the Bohmong Circle extended . This administrative structure remained in place until 1964, when the introduction of local self- government abolished the special status of these circles and brought local administration under the control of the central government.

She is credited with creating the concept of \\"mash-ups\\", editing a TV show or a film by disconnecting the images from the original soundtrack and re-editing them to a song to tell a new story. Fong's media practice includes zine editing, short story writing, slideshow creation and sketch comedy. The United Federation of Phoenix While attending Arizona State University in 1973, Fong was compelled by a newspaper advertisement to join a group of students in forming a Star Trek fan club. This club would become the United Federation of Phoenix\\" (UFP), which stands as the longest- running Star Trek fan club in the world. What do you do with a drunken Vulcan? Fong constructed her first slideshow with another member of the UFP, John Fong, who had a collection of outtakes from the original Star Trek series. In collaboration with other club members, Fong assembled frames set to a tape-recorded audio track, that included narration written and read by Fong and, notably, an a cappella performance of the folk song \\"What Do You Do with a Drunken Vulcan?\\" The first public performance of the same slideshow took place in 1975 at a fan-run Star Trek convention. As her practice developed, Fong became interested in videotaping her performances and developed a two- projector technique allowing for soft fades between slides. Correspondence with Gene Roddenberry At Equicon, Gene Roddenberry expressed an interest in the slideshows. Roddenberry had been trying to convince Paramount Studios that there was demand for a Star Trek film and granted Fong permission to continue making slideshows. The two maintained a correspondence and Roddenberry, who provided her with Star Trek slide outtakes. Both Sides Now Both Sides Now sets images of Mr. Spock to a recorded performance of the titular song by Leonard Nimoy. Fong says that her Both Sides Now performance was inspired by the music video for the Beatles' \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" single. As with Fong's work, this 1967 promotional clip interprets a song with images that do not depict the performance of the song by the artist. In an interview with media studies academic Francesca Coppa, Fong described her interpretation of the performance: > Spock is such a dual character: half human, half Vulcan. Half trying to > follow Starfleet. half trying to do the whole thing with his parents. The > two sides of him. And then there's Chapel, and then there's T'Pring, and > then there's Kirk.

The series premiered on 1 June 2016 on SundanceTV in the United States and 2 June (other side of International Date Line) on ABC in Australia. The six-part drama series reimagines several stories of the Aboriginal Dreamtime in a modern, superheroic context, and reflects on racism, asylum seekers and border protection. Its central story revolves around two estranged Gumbaynggirr brothers who are forced together to fight for their own survival when one of them is passed the mantle of the \\"Cleverman\\". Creatures from the Dreaming also feature in the series' real world dystopian landscape. The series was renewed for a second series on 2 June 2016, set six months later, having received 450,000 in funding from Screen NSW. The second series aired another 6 episodes in 2017, concluding the series with a total of 12 episodes. Cleverman The Cleverman is an important figure in many Australian Aboriginal cultures. Series creator Ryan Griffen describes the Cleverman as \\"like the Pope of the Dreamtime ... the conduit between the present and the Dreaming\\". The version in the television series combines many Cleverman traditions from different Aboriginal clans to create a superheroic version, with powers relating to the Dreaming's connection to past, present and future. Koen West, the protagonist of the series displays his powers through both seasons either from instinct or learned by experience. He can heal instantly, and can not die by conventional methods, but can be hurt or killed either by a being from the spiritual plane such as the Namorrodor, or the tree sap his brother Waruu used from their childhood tree that he forged into a dagger. Koen can receive visions from touching others seeing future events, and he can shape shift into a bird when escaping or needing to sneak into a building. He also has access to a spiritual energy shot dubbed the ‚ÄòBlue Blast‚Äô, a ball of energy fired from his chest that when it hits its target it separates them from their soul thus when they die they fade to nothingness. Koen can swallow the soul if he chooses to erase it from existence or return it to its body by killing the host and resurrecting them. As Cleverman, Koen uses the Nulla Nulla, a traditional Aboriginal War Club also used by the Hairies. Hairypeople The Hairypeople or \\"Hairies\\" are designed by Jacob (\\"Jake\\") Nash, production designer for the Australian Aboriginal Bangarra Dance Theatre, and realised by the Weta Workshop, known for their work on The Lord of The Rings and other fantasy and science fiction films. The Hairypeople in Cleverman are inspired by Australian Aboriginal mythology of hairymen drawn from multiple Aboriginal peoples, including the Gamilaraay and Bundjalung people of northern New South Wales. In the series, they speak Kumbainggar, another language from northern New South Wales. In the world of Cleverman, Hairies are stronger and hardier than humans, covered in thick facial and body hair, and have tough, sharp fingernails. They also have much longer lifespans. They share some things with Aboriginal Australians, including a knowledge of land, culture and the Dreaming. Their DNA differs enough from humans to be considered a different species. They come to the notice of modern human society six months prior to the beginning of the series, in an event known as \\"Emergence Day\\". Those who choose to live their lives as they always have‚Äîcovered in a coat of hair and speaking their traditional languages‚Äîare confined to \\"The Zone\\" by a fearful government. To escape, some Hairies become \\"shavers\\", learning to speak English and removing their body hair in order to blend in with human society.

The gritty Australian production uses a sci-fi backdrop to test notions of racial identity and integration with a twist of supernatural terror\\", and went on to say \\"The first episode is confusing, introducing a multitude of characters and agendas. Stay with it. The second episode brings several of the characters and the conflicts into focus.\\" Mike Hale of The New York Times stated that \\"Cleverman has a rough immediacy in its pacing and cinematography that helps to make up for its deficiencies elsewhere, and if you have an appetite for sci-fi conspiracy thrillers, it's worth sampling.\\" A review from The A.V. Club said \\"Cleverman is full of potential\\" but \\"is too busy building a world to tell a story.\\" Ratings The American premiere on 1 June 2016 gained 197,000 viewers, and an 18‚Äì49 demo rating of 0.04, while the Australian premiere the following day was watched by 452,000 viewers.

In 1921, 2CM became the first Australian station to regularly broadcast music and talk. (However, Ernest Fisk (later Sir Ernest) of AWA ‚Äì Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) did conduct an isolated experiment in which music was broadcast, in 1906). In some quarters Maclurcan has been called Australia‚Äôs leading radio amateur. History The electrical engineering firm of Maclurcan and Lane was issued an experimental licence in 1910. The principals of the firm were Charles Dansie Maclurcan and his brother-in-law Cyril Herbert Dodson Lane; Both were wireless experimenters and the firm traded with other Sydney area wireless experimenters, although this was a minor part of their business. The station was established on the roof of the Wentworth Hotel and both were involved in transmission and reception from the station. A major fire started in the station's equipment room in 1912 destroyed the valuable wireless facility. Only concerted action by the fire services prevented the fire spreading to the hotel proper. The station was not re-established prior to the commencement of WW1 when all experimental licences were revoked for the duration. In 1921 2CM commenced broadcasting Sunday night classical music concerts on the long wave band (214 kHz.), using seven watts. Maclurcan broke numerous long-distance broadcasting records, including an O.0037 watt transmission, that was recorded as being heard in New Zealand and San Francisco. It is believed that he was the only Australian amateur allowed to operate during World War I. At this time, the station was situated at the Maclurcan family‚Äôs Wentworth Hotel, in the Church Hill district of the Sydney CBD, but after the war, Maclurcan built a new installation at his home in the Sydney suburb of Strathfield. 2CM was issued with the first broadcasting licence in Australia (Licence No.1, signed by Prime Minister William Morris (Billy) Hughes,) in December 1922. (2SB was later the first station to be officially recognised, on 23 November 1923). Maclurcan received over 2,000 letters from listeners who had heard his initial transmissions. 2CM was also the first station to publish a program guide. Each day‚Äôs broadcasting ended with the invocation: don‚Äôt forget to wind up the clock and put out the cat. 2CM was transferred to the short wave band on 21 February 1924. Charles Maclurcan was President of the Wireless Institute of Australia, immediately following Sir Ernest Fisk. Maclurcan also designed and built the popular Maclurcan radio receiver. The call sign 2CM is the only one listed by the Federal Government as never to be reissued, in recognition of the pioneering achievements of Charles Maclurcan.Bruce Carty, Australian Radio History, Sydney, 2011.http://bpadula.tripod.com.au/australshortwave/id34.html See also * History of broadcasting * History of broadcasting in Australia * Oldest radio station * Timeline of Australian radio References History of broadcasting History of radio History of telecommunications in Australia Defunct radio stations in Australia ","title":"2CM"},{"id":"46566860","text":"The Federal University of Acre' (', UFAC) is a Brazilian university with headquarters in Rio Branco, Acre.

While the party's main concerns were the impact of clothes on men's health and hygiene, their mission also aimed to increase the variety and choice in men's clothing.  Background  The injuries and casualties of World War I shifted the public's focus to the capabilities and general health of the human body, and a general concern for the social and medical impacts of clothing grew. The New Health Society, an entity formed to effectuate change in these areas, was composed of a group of professionals led by Alfred Charles Jordan who wanted to improve the overall health of adults and children. They pushed for more exercise and fresh air, improved diets, and improved conditions in homes and workplaces. In 1927, Sir Arbuthnot Lane, a co-founder of the New Health Society, formed the Clothing Subcommittee, a subcommittee within the society focused on the health impacts of dress. On 12 June 1929 this subcommittee officially separated from the New Health Society to form the Men's Dress Reform Party through an address to the public in London, England. It read: \\"Men and women, old and young, rich and poor‚Ä¶ interested in healthier and better clothes for men‚Ä¶[and to] reform their clothes with as much profit to health and appearance as women have recently achieved.\\"  Leadership  Alfred Charles Jordan, Sir Arbuthnot Lane and Dr. Caleb Williams Saleeby served as the leaders of the Clothing Subcommittee and led the charge to form their own party, with Williams as the Chairman of the Council of the Party. Founding members also included the members of the former Clothing Subcommittee, the Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, the Very Revd William Inge, Guy Kendall, Richard Sickert, Ernest Thesiger, and Leonard Williams.Sadar, John Stanislav. (2016). Through the Healing Glass: Shaping the Modern Body through Glass Architecture, 1925-1935. Routledge. p. 106. Ideology John Carl Fl√ºgel, a psychologist and member of the MDRP, claimed since the end of the 18th century men had been ignoring the colorful, elaborate, and varied forms of \\"masculine ornamentation.\\" He called this time the Great Masculine Renunciation. \\"Man,\\" Fl√ºgel claimed, had \\"abandoned his claim to be considered beautiful. He henceforth aimed at only being useful.\\" This view aligned with that of founding member of the Men's Dress Reform Party, William Ralph Inge. Inge believed that the democratic movements of the French Revolution had led to the increasingly dull male look: \\"to escape the guillotine, dress as bourgeois as possible.\\" The party's goals were largely reactions to circumstances brought on by World War I. They saw the everyday man as \\"oppressed by capitalist labor\\" and saw his clothes as \\"depressing\\" and lacking in creativity. The military-style uniformity of the interwar period had created a culture of men who were happy to see others dressed like them, as opposed to seeing those who craved individuality. World War I also brought increased unemployment, which caused state intervention, which the Men's Dress Reform Party saw as the \\"oppression of professionals\\". Lastly, the status of women in society was changing. Feminism was developing in the interwar period, as women had taken over for men during World War I in jobs, schools, and social life. This threatened men, causing some to feel \\"like accessories to women\\". The MDRP sought to improve the health and hygiene of men by changing their dress, as they saw the typical male styles and materials growing more restrictive and harmful, while women's clothing was increasingly becoming more \\"emanicipating\\" Their goals included \\"freeing the neck\\" by wearing the \\"Byron collar\\" which was an open-front collar, and gaining approval of the kilt as everyday wear for men. They also preferred blouses instead of shirts, sandals over shoes, and shorts or breeches to trousers. The party felt that hats and coats were only acceptable in appropriate weather, and that underclothing should be loose. Most of these rules were already acceptable for occasions such as vacation, but the party looked to make these the standard for town, professional, and evening dress.  1929‚Äì1937 Unlike other organizations of the time, the MDRP had no formal journal. Instead, the group published articles about their reform ideas in Sunlight, a quarterly journal produced by The Sunlight League. MDRP member Dr. Caleb Saleeby chaired the Sunlight League, and thus incurred the league's support of the Men's Dress Reform Party. A Design Committee was organized to construct designs of \\"acceptable\\" clothing, and received national attention for their recommendations. Members claimed that branches were forming in all corners of the world, including India, China, Australia, South Africa, the USA, New Zealand, Canada, and Europe in addition to the approximately 200 branches in the UK. These groups held social events, rallies, and debates, but the prevalence of such events decreased with the onset of World War II. In 1937, the Men's Dress Reform Party lost the support of the New Health Society due to financial trouble and eventual bankruptcy. Then, in 1940, the Sunlight League also dissipated after a bomb destroyed their offices and the death of its founder, Dr. Saleeby. After this period, the Men's Dress Reform Party largely ceased to exist.

She now lives in Australia. Verolme has written about her experiences as a child in Bergen- Belsen. She is a recipient of the Australian \\"Most Successful Migrant\\" award.  Early/personal life   Moving with family  In 1931 the Werkendam family moved to Amsterdam from Antwerp. Eight years later, World War II broke out and May 1940 the Germans occupied the Netherlands.  WWII  In 1943, when Verolme was 12 years old, the Werkendam family was transported first to the Westerbork camp for a short stay, then to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. At Bergen-Belsen, Verolme and her brothers, Max and Jack, were sent to Barrack 211, also known as the Children's House. Sister Luba, a Polish prisoner, saved the children and took full responsibility for the group. Due to Verolme's age, she was tasked with supervising the small children there. She became known as 'Little Mother'. Food and water was very limited and the conditions of the barracks were poor. Hetty relied on other children who were older for support and good spirits amongst the growing number of children. Sister Luba had other ladies to help her protect the children; however, many died. Their bodies were piled up on a mound right outside the Children's house. When World War II was in its last months, the camp experienced a typhus epidemic. Verolme fell sick, but survived. In April 1945, the British Army liberated Bergen-Belsen.  Experiences/death of family and friends  On Friday 2 October 1942 at 8:15 am, Verolme's grandmother, grandfather and cousin were taken away and killed. Verolme's school boyfriend and her school friend Sonia Santiel both died in Auschwitz on 22 October in 1943. Later, two of her uncles, Philip Van Kamerik and Max Werkendam (b. 1917), died in Bergen- Belsen. Verolme lost over 110 Werkendam family members during the Holocaust, spread through many work and death camps. As recently as 2015, names are still emerging of relatives who perished.  Post WWII  After the war, Verolme and her brothers were reunited with their parents. With assistance from the Red Cross organisation, the family moved back to the Netherlands. As an adult, Verolme built a successful career in the fashion industry. In 1954, Verolme emigrated to Australia. Once there, she worked as a waitress, bus conductress, door-to-door sales person, real estate agent and a shopping centre developer. Verolme became the first female president of the Netherlands Society in Adelaide and was on charity committees such as the Lady Mayoress's Committee and later worked with the Ethnic Affairs Council. She is a founding Trustee of Children of Belsen and The Holocaust Trust, formed to help holocaust survivors, their descendants and promote the continued awareness of the Holocaust.

WVE is a non-profit organization (501(c)(3)) whose mission is to amplify women's voices to eliminate toxics that harm communities and health. With its inclusive vision of environmental work WVE has become a hub for visionary feminist environmentalism that recognizes the systemic connections between health, class, race, and the environment. Addressing the inter-connectivity of these various channels of exposure to toxic chemicals has been key to WVE's approach which is multi-scalar: targeting consumer behaviors, corporate practices, and government policies. History Women's Voices for the Earth (WVE) began in Missoula, Montana in 1995 in response to a lack of diversity in the environmental movement. Early work focused on local issues including, reducing pesticide spraying by state and local agencies, addressing air pollution from a nearby mill, and stopping a proposed goldmine on Montana‚Äôs Blackfoot River.

Monks remained at the site for nearly a century, then the monastery was almost abandoned. The structures passed to the parish and were occupied by the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin monks in 1537, who dedicated the church to the St Michael Archangel. This order was dedicated to a more eremitic lifestyle befitting this rural site. In 1634, the church was rededicated to St Antony of Padua.

The by-election came about because Vernon Reed's win in the 1914 general election was declared void by an electoral court. The seat was won by William Stewart of the Reform Party. Reed, who was also of the Reform Party, was barred by the court from standing for election for 12 months. Background Reed was first elected to the Bay of Islands electorate in the 1908 general election as a candidate of the Liberal Party. The resulted in significant losses for the Liberal Party and Joseph Ward's government survived a no-confidence motion on the casting vote of the speaker only. Ward chose to resign, though, and made way for a new liberal Prime Minister, Thomas Mackenzie. Reed expected to be part of the new cabinet and the media discussed that he might be appointed Attorney-General due to his legal background. Reed was invited to cabinet, but he did not join because the majority of the cabinet did not support his views of freehold. When the Mackenzie government faced a no-confidence vote in July 1912, Reed voted with the opposition, thus effectively joining the Reform Party. Reed's switch to Reform caused problems in the . George Wilkinson had been the Reform candidate in the Bay of Islands electorate in 1911, he was keen to represent Reform in that electorate in 1914, and he had the backing of the local electorate committee. Reed also wanted to run for Reform, and as he had the backing of the party head office, he was declared the official Reform candidate. Reed narrowly won the election against Te Rangi Hƒ´roa of the Liberal Party, with Wilkinson coming third. Bill Veitch, at the time a United Labour Party MP in Wanganui, claimed that Wilkinson had been under immense pressure from the Reform Party not to contest the Bay of Islands election, and that William Massey had promised him a seat in the Legislative Council in return, an allegation later picked up by other media outlets but also implicating Reed in the affair. This complaint was elevated to a formal election petition in April 1915 by Waipapakauri resident Edward Evans and Edward Parsons of Waipuna on the Whangaroa Harbour, who engaged a King's Counsel, John Findlay, and a solicitor, Bill Endean, as their counsel. Reed used his brother John, also a King's Counsel, as his legal representative. The primary complaint was that Reed had, through an intermediary, tried to convince Wilkinson to retire by promising him a seat on the Legislative Council, and to reimburse him for his election campaign expenses. On 8 May 1915, the petition was upheld Justice Chapman and Justice Hosking, the election declared void, and Reed barred from standing in another election for one year. Since 1913, there have been over 100 by-elections held in New Zealand, and this was one of only five cases where a general election was declared void by the courts. Result and aftermath The following table gives the election results: On 8 June 1915, Stewart won the by-election against George Gardiner Menzies of the Liberal Party. Stewart resigned his seat again in March 1917 owing to not being able to give enough time to his constituents and because of business pressures, but the editor of the North Otago Times offered a different explanation: > Mr Stewart silently served in the House of Representatives as a sort of > political warming pan for the Bay of Islands seat while Mr Vernon Reed, its > former occupier as a supporter of the Reform Party, marked time during the > period of his technical disqualification as a candidate at the 1914 > election. Immediately that time was over, Mr Stewart resigned owing to > pressure of private business. Stewart's resignation caused the and Vernon Reed stood again for the Reform Party. In accordance with the agreement between the Reform and Liberal parties during World War I, the Liberal Party did not field a candidate, as the Reform Party held the seat prior to the by-election. With no other candidates having come forward, Reed was declared elected unopposed. When the Massey government made 19 appointments to the Legislative Council in May 1918, Stewart was one of the appointees.

History It was initially built as a bastion that was part of the medieval walls of the city. There are two theories about the name pallata: it may be derived from palizzata, the Italian word for a palisade, or it may derive from the name of Pallas Athena, with the stones perhaps having been purloined from a temple of that goddess. Construction began in 1254, in the city quarter of San Giovanni. It was associated with a medieval gate, the Porta di San Giovanni, in the early walls of the city. The tower once held the vaults of a bank or Monte di Pieta. Over the centuries, decorations were added, such as a clock in 1461 and merlons and a small tower at the top between 1476 and 1481. In 1597, the west side of the tower had the addition of a fountain, built in Mannerist style. The fountain was based on a design and iconography by Pier Maria Bagnadore and built by the architect Antonio Carra, and the statuary was completed by the sculptor Valentino Bonesini.Guida di Brescia rapporto alle arti ed ai monumenti antichi e moderni, by Federico Odorici (1853), page 112-113.

The hotel was purchased and renovated by Denton Corker Marshall Architects in 1989.  History  Formerly a rag trade warehouse built in 1938, it was bought over by Denton Corker Marshall architects in 1989, who converted the building into a boutique hotel. Construction phase 1 started out from its basement from May 1989 until October 1990. The bistro bar was located in the basement, opened after phase 1 to December 1991, and was temporary closed down for phase 2 construction, which started on January 1992. The hotel officially opened in November 1992. In 2013, the hotel was bought by three new owners, Dion Chandler, Ozzie Kheir and Simon Ongorato, and they hired design studio Hachem to redesign the hotel's interior and image.  Description  Situated within the former rag trade building on Flinders Lane, within a dense area of Melbourne's CBD, the original 1930s building is a concrete framed structure, free of columns with beams spanning 3.8 metre centres from wall to wall piers. It was originally designed as a street facade building, with the lane facade rendered in cement with openable steel framed windows to provide lighting from the side. The Flinders Lane facade was painted and rendered, with horizontal full-width strip windows surrounded by projecting concrete heads and sills. The semi-basement level and ground floor were clad with ceramic tiles. In 1989 DCM Architects began refurbishing the building into the small boutique hotel, retaining much of these original design elements and adding three new levels to the roof of the existing 8 floors. The Adelphi Hotel stands eleven storeys high with 3.2 metres floor to floor, 8 metres wide and 48 metres deep. Adelphi consists of the half basement bar and cafe. The ground floor half a level up from the street has the hotel reception, lounge, bar and restaurant. There are 34 hotel rooms from levels 3 to 8, with levels 3 to 6 having six rooms per floor. These rooms range from 32sqm to 37sqm and are connected via a single gallery corridor, with the front two rooms being larger to allow interconnection to create a suite. Levels 7 and 8 have five rooms per floor and a rooftop bar and restaurant area known as the Club Bar in the top three levels. Unlike conventional hotel swimming pools, DCM designed the pool in the form of a shipping container, cantilevering one metre over the front facade on Flinders Lane with a glass bottom.. to Australian architecture, giving a sense of absurdness, exaggerating common architecture principles to an extreme degree. DCM's intentions were to keep the original 1938 building intact and to take a careful and considered approach to adding and implementing new features. They implemented such elements as stainless steel, aluminium, translucent glass, timber veneered panels and coloured planar surfaces. Coloured panels in blues, greens, yellows, oranges and reds were overlaid on the natural cement grey render tones.  Key influences and design approach  All furniture and rugs were bespoke designed specifically for the hotel by the architects themselves, who wanted everything within the hotel to be Australian-designed and made. This is considered to be a complete opposite and contrasting design compared to the general design of International hotels where new innovation and disruptive design is inhibited.

Network services are offered using the company's One Marketplace hub, which aggregates the access and pricing information for broadband telecommunications services, including MPLS VPN, Ethernet over copper and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). The company buys and combines multiple high-speed network connections and then resells multiple lower-speed connections to customers. The company also manages and updates LATTIS, a proprietary database of telecom pricing information. On June 26, 2017 GTT Communications announced it was acquiring Global Capacity for $100 million and 1.85 million shares of GTT common stock. History Global Capacity, originally known as Global Capacity Group, was founded in Houston, Texas in 2000, as a wholesale broadband trading company. The two founders, John Abraham and David Walsh, had worked together at Enron's broadband unit and realized the potential demand for a broadband market trading company. The company began creating individualized communications networks that didn't rely on any one network, allowing the company to offer the best connections at the cheapest price. By 2006, the company had expanded its services from broadband delivery to network operations management and consulting services, creating and building secure, private data and voice networks for other businesses. In December 2006, the company was sold to Capital Growth Systems (CGS), and was combined with two other companies, Centrepath, a provider of network management services, and 20/20 Technologies, a provider of telecommunications quoting and configuration software. 20/20 Technologies, which had been bought by CGS, had earlier acquired software vendor Magenta NetLogic in 2004. The combined company continued to do business as Global Capacity. In November 2008, Global Capacity paid $15M to acquire Vanco Direct USA, a network service provider of consulting services for global corporate networks, and the owner of LATTIS (Local Area Transport Tariff Information System), an information tool for circuit pricing. In 2009, Global Capacity announced their organization into two groups: Optimization Solutions and Connectivity Solutions. Optimization Solutions were targeted to improving network efficiency for clients and offered network pricing, monitoring and engineering services. Connectivity solutions were targeted at simplifying the network connectivity procurement process for customers. Also in 2009, Global Capacity launched One Marketplace, a network connectivity trading platform that combines network capacity from multiple suppliers and uses telecommunications switching equipment to deploy this capacity toward market demand. In May 2011, Capital Growth Systems, Inc. (CGS) sold Global Capacity to Pivotal Global Capacity Pivotal (GC Pivotal), an affiliate company of Pivotal Group, a Phoenix-based national investment company. Later that month, the company announced the release of LATTIS Global, an extension of its LATTIS tariff quoting system, to 35 additional countries. In 2013, Global Capacity announced it was expanding its Points of Presence (PoPs) into eight Equinix data centers in North America, allowing it to connect to Equinix's Ethernet Exchange. In March 2014, the company announced the expansion of its services into the UK, citing the large number of US multi-national companies with offices in the UK. In July 2014, the company signed a master service agreement with the National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC), allowing NCTC‚Äôs 950+ independent and rural members to use One Marketplace to automatically expand their North American network service coverage outside their network service areas. In September 2014, Global Capacity announced its plan to buy MegaPath's wholesale and direct access business. The assets included those acquired from DSL- provider Covad, which in 2010 had merged with MegaPath and Speakeasy to form the new MegaPath. The acquisition was completed in January 2015. In April 2015, the company announced the availability of MPLS VPN services over the One Marketplace platform, as a result of the network assets acquired from MegaPath. In May 2015, the company announced the addition of Google Cloud to its service portfolio. On June 26, 2017 GTT Communications announced it was acquiring Global Capacity for $100 million and 1.85 million shares of GTT common stock. The deal, anticipated to close in the third quarter of 2017, was expected to help GTT expand its SD-WAN and data center services. Products and services One Marketplace Global Capacity is a network service provider focusing on the delivery of Connectivity-as-a-Service (CaaS). The company purchases high-bandwidth connections from network operators and resells lower-speed connections to other network operators, through an interconnected network platform called One Marketplace. One Marketplace allows network operators to obtain quotes on wholesale services, and it automates their purchases. Customers access One Marketplace using an application called Circuit Lifecycle Manager (CLM). The company offers an Application Programming Interface (API) for CLM, to allow third developers to create complementary applications for accessing One Marketplace. One of the applications the company developed for One Marketplace is Network Builder, used for designing wide-area networks with a modeling approach allowing customers to examine different scenarios when designing their networks. Using the Covad legacy access infrastructure purchased from MegaPath, the company also sells its own Ethernet over copper and DSL connections to customers. With Global Capacity's equipment located inside the phone companies' central offices (COs), One Marketplace calculates whether a customer can get Ethernet over copper service or DSL service at a specific address by measuring the distance from the customer site to the serving CO. As of January 2015, the One Marketplace platform included access to 41 points of presence (PoPs), 2,007 COs and over 4,500 last-mile network interconnections for customer service delivery. LATTIS tariff pricing database The company owns and updates the LATTIS tariff pricing database, which provides access to a database of published local area tariff rates for multiple carriers and geographies. The database includes 325 tariffs with large service providers, including tariff rates for E-LINE and E-LAN services offered by ILECs and operators including AT&T;, Verizon, CenturyLink, FairPoint Communications, among others. The database is also targeted towards international carriers trying to understand telecommunications pricing in the US market. LATTIS stands for Local Area Transport Tariff Information System. Global Capacity acquired LATTIS from Vanco Direct in 2008. Network management services The company also offers a range of network management services related to the development, enhancement and monitoring of broadband networks. Awards and recognition In 2015, the company was awarded the Pipeline Innovation Award by communication industry publication Pipeline, for the One Marketplace solution and Network Builder application. In 2015 and 2014, the company was awarded the Communications Solutions Product of the Year by global media company TMC for the One Marketplace solution and Network Builder application. In 2014, One Marketplace was awarded the Best Service Innovation award for its One Marketplace solution, by Capacity Magazine, a publication of Capacity Media, a company focused on the wholesale telecommunications industry. In 2012, One Marketplace was named Best Technology Partner by Capacity Magazine. In 2011, the company received Internet Telephony Magazine's TEM award for their ability to help telecommunications expense management.

He is a former member of the All India Muslim League, who served as a Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan (1990-1993). During the pre- and post-partition of the subcontinent, Nazir Ahmed Khan played a significant role in political parties such as the All India Muslim League (Pre-Partition) and Jamaat-e- Islami Pakistan.  Early life  Nazir Ahmed Khan was born in 1923 to a Muslim Rajput family in the Tehsil Batala of District Gurdaspur. His great- grandfather accepted Islam and changed his name from Kesar Singh to Kesar Khan. Keser Khan was the direct descendant of famous Rajput warriors, Jaimal and Fatta, known for their legends. One legend was their resistance to Mughal Emperor Akbar, when Akbar's army besieged the fort of Chittor. After the Partition of India , Nazir Ahmed Khan's family migrated to Sialkot Pakistan. He later permanently settled in Bhopalwala, a small town of Sialkot district. Nazir Ahmed Khan holds a Bachelor of Education, a Diploma in Civil Engineering and later completed his master's degree in Political Science. In 1940, when All India Muslim League adopted Lahore Resolution (Urdu: ŸÑÿß€ÅŸàÿ± ŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ±ÿØÿßÿØ ), popularized as Pakistan Resolution or Resolution of Pakistan, Khan was a student in M.A.O College of Amritsar, where poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz was his professor of English. During the years 1944 - 1948, Khan worked as a subengineer in the Public Works Department. From 1949 - 1962, he served as School Teacher and then College Lecturer in Tehsil Daska of Sialkot District.  Career  In the general elections of 1990, Khan was elected as Member of National Assembly of Pakistan (MNA) from NA-87 Sialkot-III, which is divided into two constituencies NA-111 Sialkot and NA-112 Sialkot. He stood for Jammat-e Islami-Pakistan at that time, but after being elected, he requested his party Jammet-e-Islami to detach him from party responsibilities. His three-year term ran from 1990-1993. As a member of National Assembly and Ruling Alliance, Khan represented Pakistan in Iran and 6th OIC Summit Conference in Dakar, Senegal (9‚Äì11 December 1991). He was one of the least controversial and honest members of Pakistan National Assembly. During his tenure, he strived to eradicate corruption from Government Departments, especially Police. When Ghulam Ishaq Khan dissolved the National Assembly in 1993, city police of Daska launched a celebratory gunfire to hail the decision. Upon asking the reason of aerial firing by the Assistant Commissioner of Daska, policemen replied ‚ÄúThank God we finally got rid of the old man‚Äù(Punjabi: ÿ¥⁄©ÿ± ÿß€í ÿ®ÿßÿ®€í ÿ™Ÿà⁄∫ ÿ¨ÿßŸÜ ⁄Ü⁄æŸàŸπ€å ).

When Muhammad Ali Jinnah was travelling to Lahore with his team for the three-day general session, the occasion later marked as Lahore Resolution or Pakistan Resolution, Khan was one of the students who greeted him at Amritsar Railway Station. In 1946, when All India Muslim League started rallies against the Government of Khizar Hayat Tiwana (Prime Minister of Punjab Province), Khan actively participated in these rallies. Each day during the rallies, a group of Muslim League's youth surrendered to the authorities. The decision of volunteer arrest was made by Muslim League and Syed Bahauddin Ahmed Gillani (President of City Muslim League). In the final rally, Khan led the group of youth who surrendered to the authorities. He continued his struggle with Muslim League until the creation of Pakistan.  Jammat-e-Islami-Pakistan  Khan became a member of Jamaat-e-Islami in 1952 and served his party in multiple positions. He remained a member of Central Advisory Committee of Jammat-e-Islami for 42 years (1958-2000).

It originally aired on April 29, 2015. The episode was written by Stephen Lloyd & Chuck Tatham, and directed by Chris Koch. In the episode, Claire tries to bribe the school Principal to give Luke an award as she thinks that Luke's bad mood is because Alex gets all the awards each year. Luke and Manny are fighting over a girl. Gloria tries to interfere when she sees how Haley's boss treats her with no respect. Jay is upset that Gloria wants him to get Lily's princess castle for Joe, while Phil is upset because Claire does not allow him to buy a vintage Ms. Pac-Man game. Mitchell and Cameron feel like they want to adopt another kid but after second thoughts after babysitting Joe. \\"Integrity\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Plot Jay (Ed O'Neill) begins to worry that he does not have a conventionally masculine son, as Manny (Rico Rodriguez) mourns his girlfriend's loss and Gloria (Sofia Vergara) dresses and makes up Joe (Pierce Wallace) like a girl. Phil (Ty Burrell), who runs errands with him in order to get Lily's (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) Princess Castle for Joe, is upset too as Claire (Julie Bowen) refuses to let him buy a new Pac-Man game. On the road, the two men bond over their respective difficulties and exchange advise with each other, until Phil misinterprets Jay's words and unties the castle from the car. The castle falls in the road and a truck hits it before the two of them get it back, resulting in its destruction. Haley (Sarah Hyland) feels as if her boss, Gavin Sinclair (Michael Urie), disrespects her since he treats his own plant better than he treats her or his employees. Gloria suggests that Haley should stand up for herself more, but Haley explains that Gloria cannot understand the full situation, as Haley still lives in her parents‚Äô house and does not have a rich husband to fall back on. At first, Gloria seems to understand, but then her choleric personality comes back and she forces Gavin to apologize to Haley. Luke (Nolan Gould) feels bad because Manny's girlfriend hit on him, but Claire misinterprets his mood as him having trouble in accepting the fact that Alex (Ariel Winter) receives medals from their school while he gets nothing. Claire decides to visit Principal Brown (Andrew Daly) who, though he remembers Alex and Haley, has no recollection of Luke and does not seem to know who he is. When Claire fails to bribe him in giving an award to Luke, she pushes the car of the winner of the \\"Integrity Award\\" into a handicapped parking space. When the Principal finds the car there, he decides to finally give the award to Luke. Luke soon reveals that he did not want an award in the first place, and consequently lived the worst day of his life. Initially believing Manny to be the real culprit, Luke prepares to fight him, until Claire reveals the truth. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) have the desire to adopt another child but because they think that the other one might not be ready, no one says anything and they try to make each other understand their wish by babysitting Joe and looking happy while doing it. Lily feels excluded but Mitch and Cameron notice that Joe can be quite handful, especially when he begins to break and damage their possessions. They ultimately realize they are more than happy with their lives as they are, and decide not to adopt another baby. The episode ends with the whole family (except Haley) trying to re-build Lily's princess castle and paint it into a Pirate's castle for Joe, while he and Lily play together. Alex receives more prizes and medals and provides a speech to the family about integrity. Reception Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"Integrity\\" was watched by 8.00; down by 0.85 from the previous episode.  Reviews  \\"Integrity\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Whitney Evans of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4/5 saying there were a lot of moving parts in the episode and some stories worked better than the others but everything came together beautifully at the end. Evans praises the pairing of Phil and Jay stating: \\"You know you're in for a fun half hour whenever Jay and Phil are together. Of all the many Modern Family pairings over the years, the Jay and Phil dynamic has always been one of the stronger ones. I could watch Phil attempt to give Jay a high five over and over again and it would never get old.\\" Lisa Fernandes of Next Projection rated the episode with 7.5/10 commenting on the plot around Joe, with Jay's reaction to Gloria painting Joe's toenails red and wanting him to get Lily's Princess Castle for him: \\"This episode isn‚Äôt the worst thing the show‚Äôs ever produced but it also serves as an example of how far behind American society it‚Äôs fallen. In a world where transgender rights is being celebrated and the struggle for acceptance is reaching a new fever pitch, we should be beyond plots like these.\\" By concluding her review she says: \\"Embarrassing gender politics combine with decent humor. Kudos to Ariel Winter for providing the episode‚Äôs biggest laugh with Alex‚Äôs multiple acceptance speeches over the credits.\\" David Kallison of The A.V. Club awarded the episode with a C+, also criticizing the way Joe's plotline was presented. \\"It‚Äôs honestly a bit strange how Modern Family handles this storyline. [...] I‚Äôm not saying the show is required to dive into a thesis on gender dysmorphia, but you‚Äôve never seen fear on a dad‚Äôs face like when his boy grabs a pink bike. ‚ÄúIntegrity‚Äù seemed to be set up to make fun of Jay‚Äôs fears, but instead skirts and somewhat excuses them. None of it feels narratively cohesive.

He formed a secret revolutionary society from among the members of the circle, which included the young Fyodor Dostoevsky. After the government of Tsar Nicholas I arrested the members of the Petrashevsky Circle in 1849, Speshnev was interrogated, threatened with torture, and eventually sentenced, along with Dostoevsky, Petrashevsky and others, to execution by firing squad. The sentence was commuted to hard labour in Siberia, but the prisoners were only informed of this after enduring a mock execution. Dostoevsky drew on his experiences with Speshnev's secret society and the Petrashevsky Circle when writing his socio- political satire Demons. The novel's central character‚ÄîNikolay Stavrogin‚Äîis thought by many commentators to be partly based on Speshnev. Biography Speshnev was born in the Kursk province in 1821 into a very wealthy noble family. He attended the elite Alexander Lyceum at Tsarskoye Selo, where he first met Petrashevsky. From 1842 to 1847 he lived and travelled in Europe. While abroad he studied a number of political philosophers including Feuerbach, Marx and Proudhon, and was influenced by the amoralist egoism of Max Stirner. In Dresden and Paris he associated with Polish √©migr√©s opposed to Russian rule, which piqued his interest in the techniques of underground conspiracy. He studied Buonarroti's History of Babeuf‚Äôs ‚ÄòConspiracy of Equals' , a handbook on conspiratorial tactics, and Abb√© Barruel's Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism, which described the Masons and Jacobins' alleged secret orchestration of the French Revolution. Speshnev is thought to have participated in the Sonderbund war in Switzerland in 1843, fighting on the side of the liberal Cantons. By the time of his return to Petersburg, Speshnev had become something of a legend as both a revolutionary and a Byronic romantic. A reputation as a libertine did not prevent him from being a determined and forceful campaigner for the socialist cause. He attended the meetings of the Petrashevsky Circle but, dissatisfied with Petrashevsky's lack of commitment to positive action, assembled his own secret society from among its members. In April 1849 Speshnev, along with the other members of the Petrashevsky Circle, was arrested by the tsarist government and confined in the Peter and Paul Fortress. In December of the same year, the prisoners were taken to Semonovsky Square for execution by firing squad. Just as the first shots were about to be fired, a message from the tsar arrived commuting the sentences to hard labour in Siberia. Originally sent to Tobolsk, Speshnev served most of his ten year sentence at the Nerchinsky mines. He was granted amnesty in 1856 but had to remain in exile and served in the local administration for a time before settling in Irkutsk. Here he befriended the renowned liberal governor-general of Eastern Siberia, Nikolay Muravyov- Amursky, and became part of his administration. Muravyev was the second cousin of the anarchist philosopher and exile Mikhail Bakunin, upon whom Speshnev also made a strong impression. In a letter to Herzen, Bakunin described him as \\"intelligent, cultivated, handsome, aristocratic in bearing, not at all standoffish though quietly cold, inspiring confidence‚Äîlike everyone possessing a quiet strength‚Äîa gentleman from head to foot.\\"P.S. Schegolev, ed. (1928). Petrashevtsy p 134. quoted in Frank (2010) p 145 Dostoevsky, commenting on Speshnev's appearance in Irkutsk, wrote to his brother: \\"The fate of this man is amazing! No matter where or how he shows up, the most sincere and astute people immediately surround him with reverence and admiration.\\"Lantz (2004). p 410 Speshnev was appointed by Muravyev as the editor of the local government- published newspaper, a position he held from 1857 to 1859. In 1859 he joined the governor on an expedition to China along the Amur River. Speshnev was allowed to return to Petersburg in December 1859 and with Muravyev's help had his title and rights as a nobleman restored the following year.Frank, Joseph (2010). p 276 In Petersburg he set about acquainting himself with the leaders of the new radical generation, such as Chernyshevsky and Dobrolyubov. The poet Pleshcheyev, a fellow former member of the Petrashevsky Circle, recommended him to Dobrolyubov, writing that Speshnev was \\"a man very close to my heart...He is in the highest degree an upright character with a will of iron. It can absolutely be said that, among us all‚Äîhe was the most remarkable figure.\\"quoted in Frank (2010). p 276 In 1861-62 Speshnev lived in the Pskov province. He worked as an arbitrator in disputes between landowners and peasants and was known for upholding the rights of peasants. Speshnev died in Saint Petersburg in 1882. Activities in the Petrashevsky Circle Speshnev began attending the Friday meetings of the Petrashevsky Circle in early 1848. He was resolutely in favour of promoting the socialist cause by any means possible, including terrorism, and sought to form a secret society within the circle. According to Speshnev, infiltration, propaganda and revolt should be the three methods of illegal action for a secret society. He and Petrashevsky held meetings with charismatic Siberian figure Rafael Chernosvitov to discuss the possibility of co-ordinated armed revolts. Speshnev's associate, the army lieutenant Nikolay Mombelli, initiated a series of conversations promoting the idea of organized infiltration of the bureaucracy to counter government measures. Mombelli suggested that all members should submit their biography and that traitors be executed. Petrashevsky himself, though party to the conversations, consistently urged against the adoption of violent methods. Speshnev therefore continued the formation of the society without him and succeeded in recruiting a number of talented members, including Dostoevsky. Although no real action was taken by this group, Dostoevsky had no doubt that there was a \\"conspiracy in intent\\" that included promoting dissatisfaction with the current order and establishing connections with already discontented groups such as religious dissidents and serfs. The growth of the Petrashevsky Circle in the aftermath of the 1848 revolutions in Europe led to the formation of a number of satellite groups, most notably the Palm-Durov Circle. According to Dostoevsky, the original purpose of this group had been to publish a literary almanac, but Speshnev follower Pavel Filippov convinced them to actively produce and distribute anti-government propaganda. Two works of this kind were produced, both of which were later discovered by the police. The first, a sketch entitled \\"A Soldier's conversation\\" written by another Speshnev follower, the army officer Nikolay Grigoryev, was an exhortation of the popular uprising in France aimed at a peasant audience. The second, by Filippov, was a re-writing of the Ten Commandments that characterized various acts of revolt against oppression as being in conformity with the will of God. In the Petrashevsky circle the Speshnev group's push for greater activism had been provoking conflict with those, led by Petrashevsky himself, who favoured a more moderate approach. However, Dostoevsky's reading of Belinsky's searingly anti-establishment Letter to Gogol produced a response of universal approval and excitement that transcended the deepening divisions. Filippov and Mombelli made copies of the letter and began distributing them, but it was at this time that the government decided to act. Unknown to the members, a government agent had been attending the meetings and reporting back to his superiors. On the night of April 22, 1849, approximately sixty members and associates of the circle were arrested. Among the documents found in Speshnev's apartment after his arrest was a prototype 'oath of allegiance', in which the signer would pledge obedience to a central committee and a willingness to be available at any time for whatever violent means were deemed necessary for the success of the cause.Frank, Joseph (2010). pp 151, 156‚Äì9 Despite months of interrogation, Speshnev's personal secret society was never discovered by the authorities. Its members had never disclosed its existence to others in the circle, and all had remained loyal to each other under interrogation. Under threat of torture Speshnev confessed to the original discussions within the Petrashevsky circle, taking all the responsibility upon himself. Awaiting what they thought to be imminent execution at Semenovsky Square, a telling exchange between Speshnev and Dostoevsky is said to have taken place. According to the testimony of one of their fellow condemned, Fedor Lvov, Dostoevsky approached Speshnev and quoted from Victor Hugo's The Last Day of a Condemned Man: \\"Nous serons avec le Christ\\" [We shall be with Christ]. Speshnev, according to Lvov, replied: \\"Un peu de poussi√®re\\" [A bit of dust].Lvov's Zapiska, p 188. Quoted in Frank, Joseph (2010). p 179 Speshnev and Dostoevsky Considering Dostoevsky was a devout Christian and never particularly sympathetic to the socialist cause, it is noteworthy that he was an active member of Speshnev's secret revolutionary society and had no illusions about its aims. It can be partly explained by Speshnev's charismatic personality and Dostoevsky's compassion for the terrible sufferings of the Russian peasantry, but there were other factors at play as well. Their paths crossed at a time when both, for different reasons, were deeply disenchanted with Petrashevsky. Speshnev despised what he saw as Petrashevsky's passivity in matters of social change, while Dostoevsky was repelled by his scornfully dismissive attitude toward Christianity.Frank (2010). p 140 In a letter written after Dostoevsky's death, Apollon Maykov reports that Dostoevsky visited him in January 1849 and invited him to become the eighth member of Speshnev's society, saying that Petrashevsky was \\"a fool, an actor and a chatterbox\\" from whom \\"nothing sensible would ever come\\". The aim of the society was \\"to set up a secret printing press\\" and work \\"to produce a revolution in Russia\\", and Maykov recalls an overwrought Dostoevsky \\"lavishing all his eloquence on the sanctity of this action, on our obligation to save the fatherland, etc.\\"Frank (2010). p 150Lantz (2004). p 409 Dostoevsky's friend and doctor, Stepan Yanovsky, reports that in the months leading up to the arrests his patient became anxious, irritable and melancholy, and often complained of giddiness. Dostoevsky frankly confessed to Yanovsky that the cause of this was Speshnev: he had borrowed a large sum of money from him, \\"and now I am with him and his. I'll never be able to pay it back, and he wouldn't take it back: that's the kind of man he is.\\" According to Yanovsky, Dostoevsky repeated several times: \\"from now on, I have a Mephistopheles of my own.\\"quoted in Frank (2010). p 152 According to Dostoevsky biographer Joseph Frank, Nikolay Speshnev \\"unquestionably furnished Dostoevsky, twenty years later, with some of the inspiration for the character of Nikolay Stavrogin in Demons.\\"Frank (2010). p 145 Stavrogin, like Speshnev, is a mysterious aristocratic figure moving in revolutionary circles, and a Byronic type who holds a strange fascination for everyone with whom he is involved.Frank (2010). pp 146,645 Speshnev's contemporaries spoke of his charismatic personality, his constant self-possession, and his handsome appearance and extreme attractiveness to women.Lantz (2004). p 410 Bakunin said of him that he \\"creates quite an effect: he is particularly good at wrapping himself in the mantle of a deeply pensive and quiet impenetrability.\\"P.S. Schegolev, ed. (1928). Petrashevtsy p 135. quoted in Frank (2010) p 145 Stavrogin's persona is depicted in similar terms in the novel, and his demeanour is described as \\"stern, pensive and apparently distracted.\\" While Stavrogin, unlike Speshnev, is not particularly interested in political activism, he is idolized by the master of the novel's secret revolutionary society‚ÄîPyotr Verkhovensky‚Äîand occasionally makes suggestions on how to operate the society. Frank argues that the somewhat diabolical Stavrogin is not to be identified with Speshnev the man, but is rather a kind of imagined non plus ultra of his atheistic moral-philosophical ideas, particularly those derived from Feuerbach and Max Stirner. In a letter written in 1847, Speshnev discusses Feuerbach's anthropotheism, describing it as a new religion, but with a new object - 'man' instead of 'God'. While he appears to laud Feuerbach's deification of humanity, he also denies the existence of a metaphysical authority of any kind, whether 'God' or 'man'. He sees Feuerbach's position as merely another instance of deification, and as such another appeal to an alien authority: \\"Is the difference between a God-man and a Man-god really so great?\\" he asks. Like Stirner, he argues that since such abstractions have no real authority over the individual ego, it follows that there are no objective criteria for anything at all: \\"Such categories as beauty and ugliness, good and evil, noble and base, always were and always will remain a matter of taste.\\" Frank compares these words to Stavrogin's in the suppressed chapter of Demons when, in the midst of confessing to a terrible crime, he formulates the guiding idea of his life: \\"that I neither know nor feel good and evil and that I have not only lost any sense of it, but that there is neither good nor evil (which pleased me), and that it is just a prejudice.\\"Frank (2010). pp 645‚Äì6 It is speculated that Dostoevsky also refers to Speshnev on one occasion in The Idiot. The central character, Prince Myshkin, recounts a long conversation with \\"a certain S‚Äî\\", an erudite and well-bred man, on the subject of atheism.

Racial discrimination prevented its adoption for thirty years. Background She was born in North Carolina and came from a family of inventors. Her father, who she credited for her initial interest in discovery, was Sidney Nathaniel Davidson (June 1890-November 1958). In her lifetime, he patented a clothing press which would fit in suitcases, though he ultimately made no money on the invention. Her father also patented a window washer for trains and invented a stretcher with wheels for ambulances. Her grandfather invented a light signal for trains, though this invention was stolen from him. Her sister, Mildred Davidson Austin Smith (1916‚Äì1993) invented and commercially sold board games. Kenner graduated from high school in 1931. She attended Howard University, although she was unable to finish due to financial difficulties. Inventions She invented an adjustable sanitary belt with an inbuilt, moisture-proof napkin pocket. In 1956, she was finally able to save up enough money to get her first patent on it. However, the company that first showed interest in her invention, the Sonn-Nap-Pack Company, rejected it after they discovered that she was African American. Kenner never made any money off of the sanitary belt, because her patent expired and became public domain, allowing it to be manufactured freely. Between 1956 and 1987 she received five total patents for her household and personal item creations. She shared the patent on the toilet tissue holder with her sister, Mildred Davidson. The toilet tissue holder was created to be more accessible for blind individuals and people with arthritis. The patent number was , dated October 19, 1982. She also held a patent on a back washer that could be mounted on the shower or bathtub wall. This invention was patented in 1987 patent number 4696068 . She also patented the carrier attachment for a walker in 1959, after Mildred developed multiple sclerosis. Personal Life Mary Kenner worked as a professional floral arranger and had four flower shops scattered around the Washington DC area. She worked in her stores for a total of 23 years. Kenner was married to a renowned heavyweight boxer named James \\"Jabbo\\" Kenner. Together, they lived in McLean, Virginia, near the Kennedy's complex. They were foster parents to five boys.

Works include titles such as Taken by the T-Rex, Ravished by Triceratops and A Billionaire Dinosaur Forced Me Gay. Despite being called by some in the media \\"the Kardashian of erotica,\\" the genre's titles have generated sales and media interest. Themes Works of dinosaur erotica tend to be self-published short stories and often focus on common themes such as prehistoric female hunters who save their tribes from threatening (male) dinosaurs by having sex with them. According to Professor Clarissa Smith of the University of Sunderland, who co-edits the journal Porn Studies, dinosaur erotica is essentially an appeal to sexual fantasies: \\"The idea of having sex with [a dinosaur] is outside the realms of possibility. It's a bit like 'magic', where all rules become suspended, and for that reason it may well allow ... for kinds of imaginative risk-taking impossible in more standard couplings.\\" Authors and works Noted authors of dinosaur erotica include Christie Sims, Alara Branwen, Pippa Pout, Chuck Tingle and Hunter Fox (all pseudonyms). The genre was pioneered by Sims and Branwen, who were at Texas A&M; University together when they came up with the idea. Sims' author biography claims that \\"while my outward tastes are relatively simple, my inner thoughts are filled with lusty thoughts of big, strong, powerful monsters having their way with beautiful maidens\\". Her co-author Alara Branwen describes their source of inspiration in rather more mundane terms. She was working in a supermarket to help pay her bills when a co-worker mentioned how people were publishing fiction online and suggested that she should try writing erotica. After researching what sold well, she decided to experiment with the subgenre of monster erotica. Her first story, Doing the Dragon (involving a dragon having sex with a human girl), was a success and she was soon earning so much that she quit her supermarket job and went part-time at her college so that she could focus full-time on writing erotica together with Sims. One day, thinking about the movie Jurassic Park, she \\"pictured dinosaurs having their way with women. I died laughing. I was about to dismiss these thoughts as the workings of my freaky mind, but then I had an epiphany. Dinosaur erotica was something new that I'd never tried before.\\" Dinosaur erotica is not the only genre tackled by the duo, who also write in other subgenres including \\"Dragon Beast Erotica\\", \\"Centaur Erotica\\" and \\"Dinosaur Beast Mating Erotica\\". While Sims and Branwen's titles focus on heterosexual sex, gay dinosaur erotica also exists. The Guardian's columnist Damien Walter has published a review of Hunter Fox's short story A Billionaire Dinosaur Forced Me Gay by speculative fiction author Phronk. The review comments that the book \\"has no intrinsic redeeming qualities. It is horribly written, morally questionable, and even the sex in it seems like an afterthought ... It's the Kardashian of crappy erotica.\\" Nonetheless, its mere success gives it meaning and appeal:  In other languages  The Spanish author Virginia Lauda is the first writer to publish dinosaur erotica in Spanish, with the trilogy Amada por una manada de Deinonychus (Loved by a Deinonychus Pack). With this trilogy, Virginia Lauda is also the first author to introduce lesbianism between human and dinosaurs in the genre.

The geology of the country is the base for a large mining sector that extracts gold, diamonds, iron and coal from world-class deposits. The geomorphology of South Africa consists of a high plateau rimmed to west, south and southeast by the Great Escarpment and rugged mountains beyond this there is strip of narrow coastal plain. Cratons and orogens The magenta-colored area shows the present-day extent of the Kaapvaal Craton. The basement of much of the northeastern part of South Africa is made up by the Kaapvaal Craton. To the south and east, the craton is bordered by the Namaqua-Natal belt. In Neoproterozoic times, much of South Africa stabilized into the large Kalahari Craton that came to form part of the supercontinent Rodinia. The Kalahari Craton was near the center of Rodinia with paleogeographic reconstructions indicating it was surrounded by the cratons of Laurentia, R√≠o de la Plata, Congo and Dronning Maud Land. Evidence of this is the continuation of the Namaqua-Natal belt in East Antarctica indicating that South Africa and East Antarctica formed a single continent when this belt formed about 1000 million years ago. Tectonics and erosion since the Mesozoic Since the Mesozoic the tectonics of South Africa have been shaped by an initial phase of rifting and then by episodic epeirogenic movements. South Africa is currently an elevated passive margin much like Eastern Greenland and the Brazilian Highlands. The uplift of these margins is tentatively related to far-field compressional stresses that has warped the region as a giant anticline-like lithosphere fold. These tectonics have had a profound effect in shaping the Great Escarpment and uplifting, creating and destroying plateaux including the African Surface, a key reference surface. On average, 2.5 to 3.5 km rock was eroded in the Mid to Late Cretaceous. Further erosion in Cenozoic times amount to less than one kilometer. Limited erosion means that many of the major relief features of South Africa have existed since the Late Cretaceous. Warping of Southern Africa has led to significant changes in drainage basins with the Orange River likely losing a drainage area in the Kalahari Basin, the Limpopo River losing interior drainage areas to the Zambezi River and the west-draining Karoo River ceasing to exist altogether. Overall, the boundaries of the drainage basins coincide with the axes of uplifted epeirogenic flexures. Partridge and Maud (1987) links tectonics to three cycles of landscape development: African, Post-African I and Post-African II: *African cycle: The break-up of Gondwana was accompanied by an eastward tilting of western South Africa and Namibia during the Late Cretaceous. The ensuring erosion cycle that begun with the Mesozoic rifting and uplift of Gondwana ended in the Miocene, albeit judging from offshore sediments erosion was minimal already in the Oligocene, an epoch that nevertheless was one of large-scale crustal deformation. It was during the African cycle, 70‚Äì40 million years ago that the etchplains that characterize the African Surface formed. By the Miocene the African Surface was at an elevation of 600 to 500 m. *Post-African cycle I: Erosion increased again after 150‚Äì300 m of tectonic uplift tilted surfaces to the west in the Miocene. This erosion continued until the Pliocene. Albeit erosion surfaces were eroded into existence during the cycle no well-developed planation surface was formed. The Kalahari Basin accumulated large amounts of its sedimentary fill during this cycle as did also major oceanic basins surrounding the continent. Other sediments ended up making the formations of Uloa, upper Alexandria, Bredasdorp, Elandsfontyn, Varwater. *Post-African cycle II: In the Late Pliocene the central-eastern parts of Southern Africa were uplifted up to 900 m. This uplift led to increased river incision along the coast and in the large inland rivers. While some planation surfaces were warped or eroded by the uplift a new was formed around the eastern Lowveld regions of \\"Zululand, Swaziland, eastern Transvaal, and inland of Algoa Basin\\". All of these surfaces developed in areas of weak rock. Elsewhere, surfaces resulting from erosion were not particularly flat. The drainage area of the Limpopo River decreased dramatically in Late Pliocene or Pleistocene times when its upper course was captured by the Zambezi River. Stratigraphy An approximate SW-NE geological cross section through South Africa, with the Cape Peninsula (with Table Mountain) on the far left, and north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal on the right. Diagrammatic and only roughly to scale to scale. The difference in both composition and structure of the Cape Fold Mountains and the Central Plateau surrounded by the Great Escarpment, in particular the Drakensberg, can clearly be seen. Cape Supergroup The Cape Supergroup is divided into several distinct Groups. The western and southern extents of the Supergroup have been folded into a series of longitudinal mountain ranges, by the collision of the Falkland Plateau into what would later become South Africa (see diagrams on the left). However, the entire suite in this region slopes downwards towards the north and east, so that the oldest rocks are exposed in the south and west, while the youngest members of the Supergroup are exposed in the north, where the entire Cape Supergroup dives beneath the Karoo rocks. Drilling in the Karoo has established that Cape Supergroup rocks are found below the surface up to approximately 150 km north of their northernmost exposure on the surface. The Cape Supergroup extends eastwards beyond the Fold into the northern Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, where no folding took place. Karoo Supergroup The Karoo Supergroup is the most widespread stratigraphic unit in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The supergroup consists of a sequence of units, mostly of nonmarine origin, deposited between the Late Carboniferous and Early Jurassic, a period of about 120 million years. Transvaal Supergroup The Transvaal Supergroup is a stratigraphic unit in northern South Africa and southern Botswana, situated on the Kaapvaal Craton, roughly between 23 and 29 degrees southern latitude and 22 to 30 degrees eastern longitude. It is dated to the boundary between the Archean and Proterozoic eras, roughly 2,500 Mya. It is delimited by the Witwatersrand Basin (2,700 Mya) and the Bushveld Igneous Complex (2,050 Mya). Mineral resources Diamond and gold production are now well down from their peaks. , South Africa was the world's fifth- largest producer of gold but South Africa still possesses the world's second- largest reserves of gold. It is the world's largest producer of chromium, manganese, platinum, vanadium and vermiculite and the second largest producer of ilmenite, palladium, rutile and zirconium. South Africa is one of the ten largest coal producing countries in the world. South Africa is also a huge producer of iron ore; in 2012, it overtook India to become the world's third biggest iron ore supplier to China, which is the world's largest consumer of iron ore. Prince Edward Islands Marion Island The Prince Edward Islands are a pair of islands in the south Indian Ocean; they are the country's only offshore islands. Both islands are of volcanic origin. Marion Island is the larger of the two islands and is one of the peaks of a large underwater shield volcano that rises some from the sea floor to the top of Mascarin Peak. It is the only active South African volcano, with eruptions having occurred between 1980 and 2004.

He is also a pre-Tertiary geologist/paleontologist, Paleozoic corals specialist, and archaeologist.  Biography  Admitted into the Society of Foreign Missions of Paris and ordained in 1948, he was sent to Hanoi (Vietnam) in 1951 as professor at the Petit S√©minaire. Meantime, he plunged into the study of Devonian corals of Indochina and Yunnan. In 1954 when Viet Nam was divided into North and South, he settled at Saigon.  1954-1975  When he arrived in Saigon, there was neither a geological survey nor geologists. Upon the request of the Government of South Viet Nam, he set up and oversaw the new Geological Survey, and carried out research into limestone and coal for developing a cement factory and coal mine, pure silica sands for glassworks, and mineral springs for drinking and medicinal waters. Mineral water of the Dangun Spring (Province of Binh Thu√¢n), one of the studied springs, has been exploited and bottled under the name Laska; its label mentions discovery in the 1950s by the French scientist H. Fontaine. He released the only annual geological publication Archives g√©ologiques du Viet Nam of which the first number came out in 1952 at Hanoi under the direction of Edmond Saurin who was the last chief of Geological Survey of Indochina. From then on to 1975, this publication went through 16 new editions under his responsibility. Early 1960, after getting Doctorat √®s Sciences (PhD) at the University of Paris (Sorbonne, France), he was officially appointed expert- geologist to the Geological Survey of the Republic of Viet Nam, dependent himself on the Department of Cultural and Technical Cooperation (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France) from then on to 1976. He founded the Department of Geology of the University of Hu√™ (ancient imperial capital) and supported post-graduate students at the Faculty of Sciences of Saigon. His research improved the geological maps 1/2 000 000 of the former French Indochina, the geological understanding of coastal areas, islands of the Gulf of Thailand, and early Quaternary alluvial formations in the northwest of Saigon. He also contributed to developing pilot studies in order to build up dams on different rivers (La Nga, D√¥ng Nai ‚Ä¶) and to explore heavy minerals in dunes of sand, along the eastern coast, and bauxite on basaltic plateaus. On fieldworks, he discovered a prehistoric site at Phuoc T√¢n (on the route to B√† Ria) and unearthed many others (Ngai Thang, C√π lao R√πa, ‚Ä¶). Furthermore, he studied some archeological sites (Dau Giay, Ho√† Vinh near Phan Thi√™t). In 1971, with Hoang Thi Than, he discovered a funeral jars site at Phu Hoa (Province of D√¥ng Nai). The sites of Ho√† Vinh and Phu Ho√† belong to the Sa Huynh Culture.. At the end of 1975, a few months after the establishment of the communist regime over the South, unwillingly he returned to France.  1976-1977  He joined the Catholic Institute of Paris and continued his research.  1978-2013  Late 1978, he was officially appointed cooperating expert to the CCOP (Coordinating Committee for Coastal and Offshore Geoscience Programmes in East and Southeast Asia) which is based at Bangkok (Thailand) and supported until 1991 by the United Nations; thereafter it was sponsored by member countries and cooperating countries. From 1973 onwards, the CCOP has conducted a research project entitled \\"Pre-Tertiary Petroleum Potentials in the CCOP Region\\" with the support of the French Government which appointed his experts on pre-Tertiary geology and palaeontology to the CCOP.Fontaine, Henri (1990). Ten years of CCOP Research on the pre-Tertiary of East Asia. CCOP Technical Publications (20), 375p.. Bangkok. Father Fontaine succeeded Mr Andr√© Bonnet, another French geologist, and spent many months each year in Asia. Following predetermined programs, he realized several missions on the field, accompanied by the geologists of the member countries of the CCOP (Cambodia, China, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand). Many thousands of samples were collected, from which thin sections were produced first for the National Museum of Natural History (France) and thereafter for Thailand. They were studied in France with the cooperation of his French colleagues. He published on the matter. His works provided many new data on stratigraphy, palaeontology and paleogeography in Southeast Asia.Carboniferous rocks were identified for the first time in different localities in east, northeast, northwest and central Thailand, in a handful of sites in Malaysia, and in Indonesia (Sumatra). The study of the Permian period was extended with more detail in these countries and in Philippines. Regarding the Triassic period, it was identified instead of the Permian at many localities of Thailand and Malaysia. The presence of marine Jurassic in the west of Thailand which had been almost unknown was demonstrated by the discovery of fossils. Reaching the age limit in his 80's, he undertook fieldwork as a volunteer with support from the national Geological Surveys and geologists of the countries of the Southeast Asia, while being on good terms with the CCOP. In 2013 at the dawn of his 90's, he performed his last fieldwork in Thailand along with Thai geologists.  2014 ‚Äì  Slowing down his pace, he pursues his research and takes pleasure in analysing his long list of publications (about 300 papers) which were sent to many technical or scientific bulletins in Asia. His international scientific career, exceptionally long (almost 60 years), was possible only thanks to effective and long-lasting cooperation and to good terms between geologists in spite of their difference of language, age and religious inspiration.

Technology JPEGmini technology has two main components: The first is an image quality detector, which imitates the perceptual qualities of the human visual system, to determine the maximum amount of compression which can be applied to each individual photo without causing visible artifacts. The second is a JPEG encoder, which adapts the JPEG encoding process to the original photos, creating the compact representation of the photos that is possible under the JPEG standard. Combining these two components enables JPEGmini to achieve an extremely high recompression ratio of up to 5x, or 80% reduction on digital photos, depending on their resolution.

It was built to replace the T. J. Clark, which was then transferred from passenger service to freight service. She was built to carry 980 passengers. However, in 2007, Transport Canada published new passenger vessel regulations regarding damage stability (TP10943) requiring various upgrades to be implemented within prescribed compliance schedules. Thomas Rennie and her sistership Sam McBride, and William Inglis were also modernized under a life extension program while a fleet renewal process was undertaken. A series of technical submissions to Transport Canada from the City's naval architectural engineering consultants took place through 2016. These technical submissions supported Transport Canada's risk assessments that considered the ferry's operations and environmental limits. Ultimately, Transport Canada approved the Rennie and McBride to be able to carry a total passenger complement of 915. In October 2012, Toronto City Council decided that funds should be set aside to replace Thomas Rennie and her two fleet-mates with new vessels. Replacement costs were estimated at million per ferry. Incidents In 1953, the Rennie ran aground at Hanlan's Point in a fog. In July 1954, it crashed into the city wharf when it failed to reverse, injuring two passengers. In 1958, when water levels were low, the Rennie ran aground at Centre Island. A police launch was able to pull the Rennie free. In 1959, while a maintenance man tested its engines, the Rennie moved slowly out of its Queen's Quay dock, unpiloted. She went out 100 yards into the harbour, and made a slow arc to the west, crashing into the wharf at the Terminal Warehouse. The boat's controls had been left in the 'dead slow ahead' position. The ship suffered minor hull damage and was repaired by Toronto Dry Dock. In 1965, the Rennie had a stack fire when its engines overheated. The William Lyon Mackenzie fireboat was able to douse the flames while Toronto Harbour Police evacuated the passengers. In 1968, the Rennie crashed into Queen's Quay ferry dock when it failed to reverse its engines. Eight children and four adults were taken to hospital with non-life- threatening injuries. The collision damaged the dock but the ferry was not damaged. In 1976, while on a party cruise, a 21-year-old male passenger fell into the harbour from the Rennie. The man spent several minutes in the water clinging to a ring buoy until Harbour Police arrived. He had to be treated for shock.

The title of the film refers to Richard Nixon's re-election slogan. The convention named Nixon as the Presidential nominee and Spiro Agnew as the nominee for Vice President. All filming takes place on the site of the convention center in Miami Beach, Florida. It was TVTV's second production, after The World's Largest TV Studio (1972), which covered the Democratic Convention one month prior. Content Four More Years was part of the guerrilla television movement. While the filmmakers do not hide their leftist sympathies, neither do they try to ridicule and instead allow all parties to express themselves. In general, the documentary avoids coverage of staged events such as performances and speeches. Instead, the camera offers a behind-the-scenes look at the staging of the event. The film utilizes shots of the convention hotel and the convention floor in both filled and empty states. Interviews are conducted in an informal, spontaneous style by Skip Blumberg and Maureen Orth. Interviews are also punctuated by irreverent moments like Blumberg playing the harmonica on the convention floor. The film avoids voice-over commentary or added music. Instead, still shots of official campaign buttons or other political buttons are used to provide context for the interviews. Campaign buttons include \\"Get to know a Nixonette\\", \\"Nixon's the One!\\", and \\"One of 250,000\\". Buttons from protesters of the event include ‚ÄúVietnam Veterans Against the War‚Äù, \\"Acid Amnesty Appeasement Vote McGovern\\", and \\"McGovern for President of North Vietnam\\". Politicians and their family members are interviewed throughout. Interviews were conducted with Nixon's daughters Julie Nixon Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon Cox, as well as Tricia Cox's husband, Edward Cox. The camera does not follow the cues of the interviewee and instead tries to extend the interview as long as possible, following Cox as he retreats into a private section of the convention floor. For the most part the film chooses to show politicians in transitional or unofficial moments rather than on stage of the official event program. For example, as Henry Kissinger gets into a vehicle, Maureen Orth asks him, \\"How are the girls?\\" to which he replies, \\"They're very pleasant\\". One exception is an extended scene of Ronald Reagan giving a speech to the Young Republicans with a young woman hollering in the front of the audience. Members of the Young Republicans are interviewed and express indignation about media reports that their participation in the event is arranged by the Republic Party rather than being self-organized. Unlike typical convention coverage, the TVTV crew sought opinions from news teams as well as politicians. TVTV asked questions relating not only about the event but about news coverage in general. On the convention floor the crew interviews Cassie Mackin, Tom Pettit, and Douglas Kiker from NBC, Herb Kaplow from ABC, and Mike Wallace and Roger Mudd from CBS. Of these personalities, only Roger Mudd refuses to answer TVTV's questions. There is also a longer interview with CBS anchor Walter Cronkite in an editing room in which he defends his decision, which Reagan had criticized, to not stand for the national anthem due to his journalistic duties. Cronkite also recommends that viewers glean their news from multiple sources and critically examine these sources for a functional democracy. The last major group featured in the film is protesters outside the convention, which includes both student protesters and Vietnam Veterans Against the War. The location of the convention was moved from San Diego to Miami in response to concerns about Vietnam protests in California. Among the crowd of anti-war veterans in the film is the activist Ron Kovic. The atmosphere outside the hotel is much different than within: the national guard is present, tear gas is used, and the film shows a congressman having trouble getting into the Convention Center due to the heightened security. Republican bystanders criticize the protesting veterans. The film concludes by juxtaposing Kovic shouting, \\"Stop the bombing! Stop killing! Stop the war!\\" with Republican delegates popping the balloons falling from the ceiling after the announcement of Nixon's confirmed candidacy. Production Michael Shamberg founded TVTV for the purpose of filming the 1972 Democratic National Convention and released The World's Largest TV Studio, a film with a similar sensibility. A positive New York Times review of The World's Largest TV Studio encouraged TVTV to continue the project and cover the Republican convention as well. The production of Four More Years was a collaboration with other technical and artistic groups, including videofreex. The production crew was composed of Wendy Appel, Skip Blumberg, Nancy Cain, Steve Christiansen, Michael Couzens, Bart Friedman, Chuck Kennedy, Chip Lord, Anda Korsts, Maureen Orth, Hudson Marquez, Martha Miller, T.L. Morey, Allen Rucker, Ira Schneider, Michael Shamberg, Jodi Sibert, Tom Weinberg, and Megan Williams. Reception Throughout September and October 1972, Four More Years was broadcast by Group W, New York's WOR-TV, San Francisco's KQED, as well as stations in Boston, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia. The documentary was well received by critics and pundits across party lines. One critic lauded TVTV's ability to produce a successful and compelling portrait \\"for the money CBS spent on coffee.\\" Four More Years was the first independently produced feature shown in its entirety on national television. Some people in the movie claimed that they did not know that the camera was wide-angled and therefore did not know they were in the shot. Additionally, the use of the Portapak, a much smaller device than typical news cameras, likely helped the crew film inconspicuously. The film has been the topic of media and art historical studies for its role in the history of counterculture media.

There are also a number of operations internationally with bases across Europe, the Middle East and North America. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and also features in the FTSE 100 Index. It is majority-owned by its chairman, Tony Murray. History Originally set-up in 1857, the company was established as a pumps specialist working on numerous schemes along the River Thames. In the late 1920s, founder Henry Sykes bought land on the Greenwich marshes to supplement premises in Bankside which became the business headquarters. 1964 saw the introduction of Andrews Industrial Equipment, which was at this time a separate entity from the Sykes brand. Andrews was predominantly involved with heating equipment and steam cleaners initially but by 1970, had branched out into air conditioning units. During this period, the company quickly broadened its geographical presence by opening depots in London, Glasgow and Nottingham ‚Äì in addition to its original base in Wolverhampton. Following Braithwaite Group‚Äôs acquisition of what was by then known as Sykes Pumps, a merger was completed in 1989 ‚Äì forming what is known today as Andrews Sykes Hire Ltd. In the years since, the organisation has been heavily involved in a number of high-profile projects including the construction of the Millennium Dome in 1999. In 2017, Sykes Pumps celebrated their 160th anniversary. The year has coincided with the company opening other depots in the UK and also marked the conclusion of one of their largest developments. In September 2017, the Queensferry Crossing in Scotland was officially opened to the public.

The player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The player unlocks chains of emails by completing a series of puzzles wherein a beam is reflected around a room to a set destination. TouchTone core concept grew from a two-day game jam immediately following their 2012 release of Gasketball, but only found its hacker theme following the mid-2013 Edward Snowden global surveillance disclosures. The tone of TouchTone story grew from satirical to serious over the course of the game's development. The game was released on March 19, 2015. Review aggregator Metacritic characterized TouchTone reviews as generally favorable. Critics praised the game's visual style and story, but criticized the way the game did not allow players to skip puzzles. Reviewers found the light-bending puzzle premise unoriginal, but appreciated its thematic connection.  Gameplay  As part of a government surveillance program, the player monitors phone calls to find public threats. Apart from infrequent interaction with their handler, the player is left to solve puzzles in pursuit of one such lead. The puzzles are based on the \\"reflection puzzle\\" popularized by role-playing video games wherein the player moves mirrors to reflect a beam of light about a room. In TouchTone, the player swipes the screen to move pieces that redirect incoming beams, symbolic of phone signals, into specific locations. The waveform beams are displayed in different solid colors and must be matched with the destination \\"node\\" of the same color by passing through moveable pieces that reflect and split the beam. The pieces do not move individually but as rows and columns in cardinal directions. The levels are displayed in an overworld with a branching, tree structure. The player must pursue multiple branches to further the story. Optional, side-story branches do not advance the main plot but have the hardest puzzles. The story is told through chains of emails, which are unlocked by completing puzzles. The player assumes the role of an American Muslim National Security Agency agent who determines whether the hacked emails are pertinent to national security. The ethics of government surveillance are a core theme of the game.  Development  Mikengreg, an indie game developer duo of Mike Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend, released the 2010 Solipskier and 2012 Gasketball together before TouchTone in 2015. After Gasketball release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend planned a celebratory road trip to a game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. Gasketball turned out to be a \\"financial flop\\", and so Boxleiter wanted to use the jam to create \\"something new, ... something really small and perfect\\". By the end of the two-day jam, the core mirror reflection mechanics of TouchTone were in place, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize the remainder of the game. During this time, the two also worked separately, and Wohlwend released the well-received Threes with Asher Vollmer in 2014. Wohlwend tried to fit audio signal elements into TouchTone nascent theme of light, lasers, and prisms. They felt this direction was unsuccessful, like a \\"boring Flash game\\", and that the game too closely mimicked \\"a hacking minigame from a bigger AAA game like BioShock or System Shock\\". TouchTone found its theme following the Edward Snowden global surveillance disclosures in mid 2013, as Mikengreg felt they could provide satirical commentary through the \\"hacking\\" element of the game. The story shed its jocular tone as it and its political content grew deeper and more serious. Boxleiter wrote most of the script, which totaled over 20,000 words in length. It was his first effort at professional writing, and it took him five months. He and Wohlwend would conference after each chapter for coherency. Boxleiter wanted the story to explore the \\"questions ... floating around the national consciousness\\" rather than be \\"heavy-handed\\" and prescriptive. Despite this work, Boxleiter felt that the story and the gameplay \\"don't necessarily interact with each other\\", with the story serving to drive those less interested in puzzles through the rest of the game. They playtested the game in public at the theater in Logan Square, Chicago, though they acknowledged difficulty in playtesting the story's private experience. Mikengreg decided against including an option to skip puzzles, which they felt would spoil the game and the player's capacity to adapt to increasing difficulty. They attribute this game design philosophy to Derek Yu of Spelunky. TouchTone was released as an iOS universal app for both iPhone and iPad on March 19, 2015. It received a front page feature on the iOS App Store upon its release.  Reception  TouchTone received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. It received Pocket Gamer silver award. Reviewers praised the game's aesthetics and criticized its unoriginal puzzle concept. TouchArcade Shaun Musgrave wrote that the game's \\"striking\\" visuals and \\"politically charged\\" message were not completely reconciled but were \\"individually strong\\". He described its art style as similar to Wohlwend's previous work and its political statement as indicative of Mikengreg's strong opinions. Musgrave praised the game's writing but thought the actual puzzles were weaker. 148Apps Jordan Minor found the \\"clinical, minimally-colored cyberspace\\" and 1970s thriller film aesthetic \\"chillingly appropriate\\" for the theme's tension. He also chided the puzzles for not being \\"a reward unto themselves\\" and the gameplay's \\"monotony\\" for being similar to that of Papers, Please without serving the same dehumanizing point. Minor called TouchTone \\"essentially a series of the hacking minigames ... [from] BioShock, Deus Ex, or Watch Dogs.\\" Pocket Gamer Craig Grannell appreciate how the game \\"often forces a kind of upside-down thinking\\" and compared its message to that of Blackbar. Gamezebo Jim Squires said that TouchTone is \\"perfectly designed for a certain set of mobile gamers\\" and compared its gameplay to the 1987 Deflektor. Despite the game's similarity to \\"countless light-bending puzzle games\\", he found Mikengreg's implementation \\"fiendishly clever\\" in the way the player moves rows of tiles rather than one at a time. Reviewers did not like the inability to skip puzzles. Musgrave wrote that moments of being \\"stuck on a mandatory stage\\" detracted from the player's investment and sense of immersion in the story. Grannell of Pocket Gamer wrote that TouchTone linearity was its \\"only downside\\", though he also wished for options to \\"undo\\" mid-game choices and to save puzzle progress upon leaving the game. Multiple reviewers appreciated the game's story. Wired Kyle Vanhemert felt that the act of determining whether messages were pertinent to national security was a \\"powerful experience\\". Squires of Gamezebo considered the story one of the game's strong points, and unusually so for a puzzle game. He wrote that there was sufficient \\"intrigue\\" to want to finish the story, and that the reward of more story encouraged him to get through the harder puzzles.

As a monarchist loyal to the carlist claimantGuinovart i Escarr√© 1997, pp. 39, 110 he acknowledged with little enthusiasm that the majority of Spaniards opted for republican solution, though he seemed to respect the choice.

Throughout all public career he vehemently supported Catalan cultural and political ambitions, yet always combined with the Spanish raison d‚Äôetat.Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 30 In the 1919 declaration Cayl√† listed his Catalan identity as third in terms of importance, put after the Catholic and Spanish ones; the statement clearly implied that being Catalan and being Spanish were complimentary selves.dedicated to Catalan spirituality, rights, language, character and ‚Äúmodo d‚Äôesser‚Äù they supported ‚Äúautonomia integral‚Äù, Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 31 Supporting various cultural initiativesCayl√† and Joventut were active as animators of ‚Äúrenaixenca castellera‚Äù local Catalan folk and festive tradition of building human towers; one of the group they supported, Colla Vella, gained fame as ‚ÄùColla deis carlins‚Äù, see Josep Miralles Climent, Aspectos de la cultura pol√≠tica del carlismo en el siglo xx, [in:] Espacio, Tiempo y Forma 17 (2005), pp. 147-174; Cayl√† and Joventut advocated declaring Catalan the only official language of Catalonia, Vallverd√∫ 2010, p. 101 he also acknowledged Catalan political ambitions, best embodied in the autonomous project; for Cayl√†, separate regional establishments were rooted in the Carlist vision.Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 32; they often used to refer to the oath, taken in name of the Carlist claimant Carlos VII by his general Rafael Tristany in Olot on 1.10.74, and pledging to defend and respect Catalan fueros, Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 34.

The regional diet was supposed to have decisive say on administrative, fiscal and economic issues, with diputaci√≥n forming the Catalan executive and municipalities allowed large degree of their own autonomy.during the meeting of Carlist Catalan executive of late 1932 he initiated two motions aiming at underlining the role of municipal and comarcal autonomy, Vallverd√∫ 2008, p. 124 Though all Catalans were obliged to defend the country, according to Cayl√† Madrid was not allowed conscription.Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 33 During dictatorship Cayl√† kept supporting Catalan ambitions, highly sympathetic to Macia and highly critical towards governmental measures applied against himVallverd√∫ 2010, p. 100, Vallverd√∫ 2008, p. 38 after the Prats de Moll√≥ affair.

Following the advent of the Republic Carlism backtracked, prompting defection of some of its most pro- Catalanist members; Cayl√† was not among them.the splitters were Esteban Ferr√© i Calvi√°, Josep M.

Trias Peitx, Anton Olivares, Francisco Balany√°, Francisco Guarner, Vallverd√∫ 2010, p. 98 anti-statute meeting The turn of Catalan case during the Republic left Cayl√† hugely disappointed. Enthusiastically supportive about the ongoing talks on autonomous statute, he refused to join the militant anti-Spanish Catalanization waveGuinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 47-8 and opposed separatism,Catalonia ‚Äûno fuera tradicionalista si defendiera la tesis de la separaci√≥n, tesis tan bien combatida por el maestro de catalanismo Prat de a Riba‚Äù, quoted after Vallverd√∫ 2010, p. 101 at best lukewarm about the ultimately prevailing, allegedly integral vision of the Republic. He believed that in the autonomous agreement the Catalan rights should have taken precedence instead of having been subordinated to the Spanish constitution.Vallverd√∫ 2010, p. 102; Joventut of 18.05.32 wrote: ‚ÄúHa faltado la voz que proclamase bien claro que los derechos de Catalu√±a son superiores a los del estado integral‚Äù Last but not least, Cayl√† was profoundly unhappy about secular character of the autonomyhe believed that ‚Äúeither Catalonia is Catholic or there is no Catalonia‚Äù, Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, pp. 31, 418 and accepted the statute not as an ultimate solution but rather as a stepping stone towards his vision.‚ÄúNo quiere decir eso que el proyecto de Estatut no tenga puntos aceptables y que constituya un paso hacia el total reconocimiento de los derechos de Catalu√±a. En este sentido y como t√°ctica de procedimiento, marcada por la mayor√≠a que regenta los destinos de Catalu√±a, puede aceptarse y votarlo. Lo que no se ha de consentir es que se tome como finalidad √∫ltima lo que solo es un paso. De hacerlo enga√±ariamos a los catalanes y enga√±ariamos a los ciudadanos de las otras tierras ib√©ricas.

Always sympathetic to the conservative Lliga, he was alarmed by militancy of Companys and the Catalan Left, denouncing ‚Äúel feixisme esquerr√°‚ÄùGuinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 261 and what he considered potentially barbarian course of October 1934, though he opposed suspension of the autonomy.Vallverd√∫ 2008, pp. 204-205 Social question primate Goma Cayl√† inherited social sensitivity from his father, possibly reinforced rather than weakened by the fact that his parent was killed as result of the social conflict. As early as during the late Restoration period he kept discussing the issue on gatherings of the Valls Traditionalists.like the lectured titled La q√ºesti√≥ social en nostra ciutat, Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, pp. 25-26 Acknowledging that ‚Äúel problema social [...] √©s el primer problema de l‚ÄôEstat espanyol‚Äù, he approached the question mostly in religious terms, perceiving it as consequence of dechristianisation or at best religious indifference of modern societies, which attempted to substitute God with false idols.Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 380 Ringing a typically Carlist tone he saw Liberalism as primordial source of evil, anti- Christian, anti-fueristaGuinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 32 and anti-social, leading to alienation of enslaved proletarian masses.Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 380 To Cayl√† the popular movements of the Left, undistinguished into Anarchism, Socialism or Communism and approached jointly as ‚Äúred syndicalism‚Äù, were deceiving the masses by utopian visions of fictitious liberty‚ÄúEl sindicalisme roig invandint-ho tot trepithava tota justicia. Les masses populars, enlluernades per un fictici sol de llibertat, no veien com els seus predicadors, tot sentat que la propietat era un robatori, anaven fincant-se i adquirint valors com qualsevol borges desocupat‚Äù, quoted after Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 40 and turning the Catalan idea into ‚Äúbranch of the Russian ideology‚Äù.Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 285; Cayl√† was hostile to what he considered dictatorships in Mexico and the Soviet Union, Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 79 According to Cayl√†, there were two concepts of tackling the burning social issue: the Socialist one and the Christian one, the latter laid out in papal teachings of Rerum novarum and Quadragesimo anno. Instead of class warfare it offered a harmonious vision of a society, stemming from Catholic principles and achieved by means of various regulatory bodies.‚ÄúDues concepcions contraposades es disputen en la pr√°ctica el terreny de les solucions: la concepci√≥ solcialista i la concepci√≥ cristiana‚Äù, quoted after Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 391 However, none of the sources consulted mentions Cayl√† as engaged either in typical Christian-democratic initiatives of this era, like Asociaci√≥n Cat√≥lica Nacional de Propagandistas and Juventud Cat√≥lica, or in various political incarnations of Social-Catholicism.Cayl√† is not mentiond a single time in Jose Luis Orella Mart√≠nez, El origen del primer cat√≥licismo Espa√±ol, [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012 His criticism of laissez-faire has also never amounted to general onslaught on capitalism; considering private property and individual self foundations of civilized societyGuinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 40 he followed Vatican in its harsh judgment of ‚Äúcapitalisme liberal‚Äù and unlimited accumulation of wealth.Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 76 Carlist standard Political and social toolset intended to defuse the social conflict was very much dependent on Christian trade unions and various associations of employers and employees. Though not an entrepreneur, Cayl√† tried to lead by example; in Valls he set up Carlist social association Agrupaci√≥ Social Tradicionalista,in 1933, see El Siglo Futuro 18.03.33, available here animated its Casa SocialGuinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 299-300; the centre focused on mostly on leisure activities, like theatre or sports and served as its treasurer.El Siglo Futuro 18.04.33, available here He kept encouraging co-operative initiatives like Cooperativa Electrica de Valls,Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 85-6 perceived as an alternative to anonymous commercial enterprises.compare co-operative efforts of another Carlist politician, Marcelino Oreja El√≥segui He also encouraged new Christian syndicates of the Tarragona province,in 1935 Gremios Obreros and Gremios Patronales, confederated in Agrupacion Gremial de Trabajadores.Bau claimed he was the founder with Cayl√† reduced to the approving role, Monserrat Cavaller 2001, p. 78 When running for the provincial Catalan parliament he competed in Tarragona as a member of the rightist coalition Uni√≥ Ciutadana,an alliance formed also by anti-separatist Lerrouxistas. As Lerroux and his vehemently anti-clerical Radicals have traditionally been Carlist enemies, with history of Carlist-Radical relations marked by violence and bloodshed, the alliance raised many eyebrows; Cayla presented his case in Joventut, see here while Carlists from Barcelona formed Dreta de Catalunya, endorsed by the then Catalan Carlist jefe Junyent.La Vanguardia 08.11.32, available hereand afterwards concluded that one of the reasons for defeat was Carlism ‚Äús‚Äôavia allunyat del poble treballador‚Äù, quoted after Vallverd√∫ 2008, p. 122 Final months monument to Catalan requet√©s There are conflicting accounts of Cayl√†'s position towards the Carlist anti-Republican buildup during the last few months prior to the July 1936 coup.

In the 1940s Cayl√† remained a hero of the Tarragona Carlists, serving as a role model for the branch opposing FrancoismCarlist anti-Francoist Tarragona groups distributed leaflets aimed against Joaq√∫in Bau and other collaborative Carlists, reading ‚ÄúEl Requet√© de los Cayl√° y de los navarros exige justicia, el Requet√© de la Tradici√≥n insobornable, el que no admite unificaciones ni pactos, escupe a los politiquillos disfrazados de carlistas que se apoyan en nosotros para su medro personal y les exigir√° cuentas de sus actos. POR DIOS POR LA PATRIA Y EL REY‚Äù, quoted after Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 217; Guinovart, Cayl√†'s personal secretary, in the 1948 local elections ran against the Falangist candidate and won, Robert Vallverd√∫ Mart√≠, La metamorfosi del carlisme catal√†: del \\"D√©u, P√†tria i Rei\\" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975), Montserrt 2014, , p. 110 and for those who chose to side with the regime, supporting the claim of self-styled claimant Carlos VIII.An internal Falangist document describing Tarragona in the early 1940s divided Carlists into 3 groups: 1) ‚ÄúUna parte bastante considerable est√° firmemente unida a Falange y la campa√±a de Carlos VIII ha aumentado bastante la fracci√≥n. Son los Tradicionalistas del grupo aut√©ntico que sigui√≥ a Cayl√°. Gente sana y ruda que constituye un grupo excelente por su espa√±olismo decidido‚Äù; 2) ‚ÄúOtra parte del carlismo autentico, algo superior en n√∫mero al anterior, forma el n√∫cleo rebelde. Su jefe provincial es un pobre diablo de Reus llamado Sugra√±es [...] pero su jefatura no la acatan mis que en su pueblo y en alguna localidad vecina. Se mueven dentro del Falcondismo y andan de capa caida‚Äù 3) \\"existe el n√∫cleo que sigue a la trilogia Bau, Sentis, Prat. Los carlistas puros est√°n en contra porque les acusan de haberse vendido al juanismo franquisme tarragona\\". In another paragraph of the same document Bau is presented as leading ‚Äúuna fracci√≥n moderada frente al integrismo del Sr. Cayl√° de Valls‚Äù, quoted after Joan Maria Thom√†s, El Franquisme des de dins: un informe sobre Tarragona, [in:] Butllet√≠ de la Societat Catalana d'Estudis Hist√≤rics 9 (1998), pp. 152-153 Juventud, the Falangist weekly launched in Tarragona in 1943 was styled as continuation of Joventut; issued in Spanish and subtitled Semanario nacional sindicalista it had little in common with the original Cayl√†'s periodical.see index of Vallencs publications available here Except singular cases of homage on part of intransigent anti-Francoist Sivattistasin 1961 they tried to unveil a commemorative plaque in Valls; it read \\"Tom√°s Cayl√° ejemplo vivo.

Una biograf√≠a pol√≠tica (1901-1980), Barcelona 2001, , pp. 161-162 the memory of Cayl√† went into oblivion; he started to figure prominently in the Carlist political discourse some time in the late 1960s. At that time the progressist supporters of socialismo autogestionario, grouped around the young Carlist prince Carlos Hugo, launched their bid to take control of the movement. Their political vision was supported by an attempt to re-define Carlist history as popular social struggle, with genuine Carlists pitted against aristocratic, clerical and conservative aliens who infiltrated into the party;compare Josep Carles Clemente, Historia del Carlismo contemporaneo, Barcelona 1977, : ‚Äúingresaron el el Carlismo grupos de la derecha integrista. Esas minorias, aunque intentaron influir en la ideologia y en la l√≠nea del partido, nunca arraiganon en √©l‚Äù (pp. 13-14), also ‚Äúintegrismo infiltrado en sus filas‚Äù (p. 23), \\"la infiltraci√≥n se iba desarrollando\\", Jos√© Carlos Clemente, Breve historia de las guerras carlistas, Madrid 2011, , 9788499671697, p. 150. Later and more elaborated versions of this theory in Clemente 2013, p. 28 Cayl√† started to serve as an exemplary case of a genuine, tolerant, humanist, progressist, democratic, proto-socialist, anti-capitalist and popular Carlist.Jacek Bartyzel, Bandera Carlista, [in:] Umierac ale powoli, Krakow 2006, , p. 307, Jacek Bartyzel, Don Carlos Marx, Wroclaw 2011, , p. 52. For the latest sample of this vision see Vallverd√∫ 2010, p. 100 (almost identical wording in Vallverd√∫ 2008, p. 302): ‚ÄúSus campa√±as ciudadanas durante el periodo republicano fueron siempre al servicio de intereses populares y destacaron por el sentido federalista y anticapitalista de sus comentarios. [...] Tanto en pol√≠tica como en religi√≥n fue un precursor de las corrientes progresistas abiertas al socialismo que se desarrollar√≠a treinta a√±os m√°s tarde en el carlismo con la llegada del pr√≠ncipe Carlos Hugo‚Äù. This vision has recently been elaborated further on in Robert Vallverd√∫ Mart√≠, La metamorfosi del carlisme catal√†: del D√©u, P√†tria i Rei a l‚ÄôAssemblea de Catalunya (1936-75), Montserrat 2014, His second biography - also highly hagiographical, though pursuing the opposite vision than the earlier one - was published in 1997 and it fits into this progressist outlook well;written by Cayl√†'s personal secretary of the mid-1930s; the work re-defines also a number of other Carlist figures, like the claimant Jaime III, presented ‚Äì in line with the general progressist interpretation ‚Äì as disposed to tolerance rather than to intransigence, see Guinovart i Escarr√© 1997, p. 39 also some fiercely anti-capitalist, anti-globalist groupings of Spanish or Catalan extreme Left keep presenting Cayl√† as their predecessor.see e.g. Tom√†s Cayl√† Grau: Catalanismo, la √∫nica soluci√≥n, [in:] Legitimista Digital.

Life There is considerable confusion about the identity and potential family connections of various musicians called Carter in Dublin and London, three of whom abbreviated their name as \\"T. Carter\\". The first was Timothy Carter (c. 1715‚Äì1772), a Dublin musician who became the father of the present (Charles) Thomas Carter and of Sampson Carter (c.1749‚Äì1815).William Barclay Squire: \\"Carter, Thomas\\", in: DNB vol. ix (London, 1887), p. 206‚Äì7. Another Irish-born composer named Thomas Carter (1769‚Äì1800) was considerably younger, but died earlier ‚Äì the London-published music of these two Thomas Carters during the 1790s is difficult to distinguish. (Charles) Thomas often, but not always, abbreviated his name as \\"C.T. Carter\\". According to John O'Keeffe,John O'Keeffe: Recollections of the Life of John O'Keeffe (London, 1826). Thomas was a choirboy in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, but there is no other evidence for this. He was organist at St Werburgh's Church, Dublin, from 10 December 1751 to 7 November 1754, when the organ was destroyed by fire.Barra Boydell, Axel Klein: \\"Carter family\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. Harry White and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p. 165‚Äì6; . There were benefit concerts on his behalf in Dublin in 1754 and 1756. He was then appointed organist at St Peter's Church, Dublin, between November 1757 and October 1762. After a new organ had been installed at St Werburgh's, he returned there for the period April 1767 to September 1769.Boydell/Klein (2013), p. 165. In late 1769, following a London repetition of the Dublin production of Amintas by George Rush (died 1780), to which Carter had written a new overture, he moved to London, obviously attempting to gain a foothold in operatic work,Roger Fiske: \\"Carter, (Charles) Thomas\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie (London: Macmillan, 1980), vol. 3, p. 836. which initially met with little success. In 1787, he became the musical director of the newly built Royalty Theatre, and in 1789 of the private theatre of the Duke of Barrymore at Wargrave. The most successful of his operas was Just in Time, produced in 1792 at Covent Garden. Despite his undoubted talent, Carter died in poverty in London. Squire explained this as \\"[‚Ä¶] his improvidence and carelessness were such that he was in perpetual difficulties\\".W.B. Squire (1887), p. 206; as above). Music Despite his long work as organist, it is surprising that Carter doesn't seem to have composed more organ music, except for one late publication. As soon as he was in London, Carter showed a remarkable proficiency at vocal music and music for the stage. Of his large-scale works, only the last one, the opera Just in Time enjoyed some success. His overtures were described as \\"of more than average ability\\", Fiske (1980) singling out the overture to the pastoral The Birthday (1787) as being \\"remarkable for an astonishingly modern sequence of chords\\" and that of Just in Time (1792) as \\"well above average for its day\\".R. Fiske (1980), as above. However, Carter excelled as a composer of songs, which were made popular during the fashionable open-air promenades in the Vauxhall Gardens. In particular, the song Oh Nanny wilt though fly with me from his first collection of Vauxhall Garden songs (1773) proved an enduring success and was sung and reprinted for many decades. Carter also wrote some accomplished music for the harpsichord or piano. Fiske (1980) described his Six Sonatas op. 3 as \\"of especial interest\\", because of its independent violin part.R.

It is a conversion of the M48 Patton medium tank chassis in combination with a German MTU MB 871 Ka 501 liquid-cooled turbocharged Diesel engine. The main role of the Keiler vehicle is clear a lane through minefields to let soldiers and vehicles pass safely. A deployable mine flail system has been fixed to the front of the vehicle, being used to clear both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. 24 Vehicles of this kind were produced between 1997-1998 for the German Army. Design Keiler is built on the M48 Patton medium tank hull. Developers removed the turret of the Patton and fitted the vehicle with a heavy-duty rotor-powered mine flail, a rapidly rotating cylinder mounted between two arms in front of the vehicle consisting of two shafts with 24 chains terminating in large metal \\"feet\\". In traveling mode the mine flail folds over the vehicle. In common with other mine flails, the spinning cylinder swings the chains around, bringing the feet into contact with the ground, thus simulating the force exerted by a person or vehicle passing over the ground. If a flail strikes the ground above a buried mine, the impact will cause the mine to safely detonate. The vehicle can clear a lane wide and long in 10 minutes. An automatic system fixed on the rear of the hull marks the cleared lane. The Keiler has no defensive weapons except its smoke grenade dischargers. The vehicle is operated by a crew of two (commander and driver). Propulsion Original engine of the M48 Patton has been replaced with a more powerful, German MTU MB 871 Ka 501 liquid-cooled turbocharged Diesel engine. This develops in traveling mode, and when driving the mine flail. A Renk HSWL 284 M transmission was fitted. The Keiler uses the same Torsion bar suspension as the M48 Patton tank, and has 6 wheels on each side.

He worked under a false name with regular factory workers, to learn on the job. He first worked as a fitter, then a driver, and later in sales and marketing. He served as the CEO of Michelin from 1955 to 1999. He increased the marketshare from the tenth top tire manufacturer in the world to number one. For example, from 1960 to 1979, he opened twenty-five new factories globally, even as far away as Vietnam. He hired Carlos Ghosn in 1978 to expand Michelin's marketshare in the United States. After he acquired Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. in 1990, Michelin dominated the US marketshare. While the buyout incurred debt for the company, Michelin stood firm in his decision to consolidate. By 1994, he was proved right, as the company was solvent again. He pioneered the use of the radial tire, which became the gold standard of tires globally thanks to him. In 1993, he launched the green tire, which helps cars consume less fuel. His leadership style was non-hierarchical. He believed in listening to all employees no matter what their ranks or social statuses were. He also believed in letting his employees take risks to innovate. Moreover, he believed business needed to be conducted discreetly and stressed the need for confidentiality. He became co-Chairman in 1999, when his son √âdouard Michelin stepped in. He retired in 2002. He published And Why Not? The Human Person at the Heart of Business, a non-fiction book published in English by Lexington Books in 2003. A speaker read a text he wrote about the same topic for a conference organized by the Acton Institute in Rome in 2007. He served as the Vice President of the Association Nationale des Soci√©t√©s par Actions alongside Edouard de Roy√®re and Bertrand Collomb. He turned down the Legion of Honour. Personal life In 1951, he married Bernadette Montagne, whose brother, R√©my Montagne, was a politician and the owner of Famille chr√©tienne, a Catholic French magazine. They had six children. One of his sons, √âdouard Michelin, died in a fishing accident in 2006. They resided at La Bosse, his grandfather's mansion in Orcines near Clermont-Ferrand and summered in the Luberon. He also owned an apartment in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. He flew his own helicopter to go to Paris. His wife died in 2013. He was a practising Roman Catholic. He shook the hand of Pope John Paul II in Rome in 2004. By the end of his life, he lived at EHPAD Ma Maison, a retirement community run by the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Roman Catholic charity in Clermont-Ferrand. Death He died on 29 April 2015 in his hometown of Clermont-Ferrand. He was eighty-eight years old. French President Fran√ßois Hollande called him, \\"one of the greatest French industrialists in the postwar years.\\" He added, \\"He understood the importance of innovation and of long-term industrial development. By developing the radial tire, he transformed a family and regional company into one of the biggest French groups and one of its best-known.\\" Former employee Carlos Ghosn, who served as the CEO of Renault and Nissan in 2015, called him \\"a humble and honest man, a humanist boss and captain of industry deeply attached to the global performance of a French industry with solid French roots.\\" Awards and Honors *1997: Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement *2008: Tire Industry Association Hall of Fame References External links *Hour-long interview with Fran√ßois Michelin in French about the workplace and the Christian faith *Acton Institute: A substitute speaker reads the lecture of Mr. Fran√ßois Michelin about Family and Economy 1926 births 2015 deaths People from Clermont-Ferrand French chief executives Michelin people French Roman Catholics ","title":"Fran√ßois Michelin"},{"id":"46569134","text":"What Women Dream () is a 1933 German comedy crime film directed by G√©za von Bolv√°ry and starring Nora Gregor, Gustav Fr√∂hlich, and Otto Wallburg.

The Aurora Borealis Express is an overnight express train operating between Helsinki and Kolari in Finland. The train travels via many major cities and towns in Finland, and stops at most of them. The total distance is a little under 1000 kilometers, and the journey lasts for 14 and a half hours. The service is bi-directional, with a corresponding train operating southwards over the same route. The train consists of seven to ten sleeping cars, two open seating cars and one restaurant car. The car types are older blue cars, which are rarely used nowadays in Finland. A few car carrier wagons are added at the end of the train to transport cars. On the last distance from Oulu to Kolari the electric locomotive is switched out for a diesel locomotive since the railway line to Kolari isn't electrified.

Course and features The headwaters of the Wickham River are situated on an area of rugged stony hills and a sandstone plateau as the river rises on the southeastern slopes of Mt Kimon. It flows generally northeast, joined by seven tributaries including the Humbert River, Soda Springs Creek, Depot Creek and Broadarrow Creek and through one permanent waterhole, Johnston Billabong, before reaching its confluence with the Victoria River, south of the Fitzgerald Range near Pompey Knob. The Wickham River descends over its course. The Judbarra / Gregory National Park was established in 1981 encompassing much of the catchment. Mount Sanford was exhumed to enlarge the park boundaries in 1996. The Wickham flows for only six months of the year, during the wet season. During the dry season, a string of waterholes form along the course of the river some of which are spring-fed and almost permanent. When Lawrence Wells started his trigonometric survey of the Northern Territory in 1905 he formed his depot on the Wickham River not too far from Victoria River Downs Station homestead. The area surrounding the Wickham River are the traditional lands of the Aboriginal community of Yarralin, also known as Walangeri. Etymology The river is named in honour of Captain John Clements Wickham who sailed up the Victoria River in 1839 aboard HMS Beagle.

Due to line maintenance on the main East-West corridor, which connects hydropower rich Eastern Turkey with the population centers in Western Turkey, the remaining lines became overloaded after the Osmanca ‚Äì Kursunlu line tripped, as the system was not in a n-1 secure state. The electric system in Turkey split in half at CET 09:36:11 and separated from the Central European (CE) synchronous zone, i.e. connecting lines to Greece and Bulgaria also tripped. This was the reason that the disturbances only had effects in Turkey and did not cascade to neighbouring countries. The two parts inside Turkey behaved differently. The Western part suffered from a lack generation (21%) and frequency went down. Load shedding schemes did stabilize the frequency, but as some power plants in Turkey did not cope with running at reduced frequency, additional power was lost and resulted in a blackout of the Western part. The Eastern part suffered from hydropower oversupply (41%) that wasn't able to flow westward. The Eastern part was accelerated by ca. 1.6 Hz/s and culminated at 52.3 Hz. Power plants tripped due to overfrequency and the initially oversupplied Eastern part collapsed at underfrequency values less than 47.0 Hz. At 16:12 (CET) - ca. 6.5 hours after the blackout - the Western and Eastern part were resynchronised, while the Turkish grid was already about 80% energized. At 18:30 almost 95% of the loads were served again.

The operation was mounted in conjunction with Operation Masher in northern B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province. The operation was inconclusive as the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Vietcong (VC) had largely slipped away.

On 6 January III MAF commander LG Lewis W. Walt instructed BG Jonas M. Platt to reestablish Task Force Delta and commence planning the operation in coordination with ARVN 2nd Division commander General Ho√†ng Xu√¢n L√£m. It was believed that the PAVN 18th and 95th Regiments and the VC 2nd Regiment were operating in Qu·∫£ng Ngai Province, but that their base areas were located further south in the coastal areas of B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province. The Marines and ARVN would attempt to engage the PAVN/VC while the 1st Cavalry Division in the complementary Operation Masher would attack the base areas. The Marines' operation plan would consist of 3 phases: first Marine reconnaissance units and an artillery battery would be landed at Ba T∆° Special Forces Camp and a company from 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines with units from the ARVN 2nd Division would reconnoiter the landing beach (named Red Beach) () northeast of ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï. On 27 January another company from 2/4 Marines and a company from the ARVN 4th Regiment would secure Hill 163 () south of Red Beach. On 28 January Battalion Landing Teams (BLTs) 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines and 2/4 Marines would make an amphibious landing on Red Beach and secure the area. Two days later following B-52 strikes further inland, the Marines would move by helicopter to cut off any PAVN/VC attempting to retreat west. Meanwhile the ARVN 2nd Division would operate to the south along the Qu·∫£ng Ngai/B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh provincial border blocking any retreat in that direction. On 10 January 2 platoons from 1st Force Reconnaissance Company and 4 105mm howitzers of Battery H, 3rd Battalion, 12th Marines were landed by helicopter at Ba T∆° Special Forces Camp and the reconnaissance Marines began patrols from the base. On the afternoon of 21 January a 14 man patrol was attacked by PAVN/VC at the base of Hill 829 () 4km northwest of Ba T∆° with the artillery forward observer going missing. The next day the Marines were again attacked by PAVN/VC and scattered into bush where they were later rescued by helicopters covered by helicopter gunships, losing another Marine missing. On 13 January the company from 2/4 Marines and the ARVN Reconnaissance Company, 2nd Division completed their reconnaissance of Red Beach. On 24 January the 1st Cavalry Division began Operation Masher. On 26 January HMM-261 helicopters landed Company E, 2/4 Marines at the ARVN Nui Dau base south of Red Beach and after midnight on 27 January Company E and the ARVN 2nd Company, 3rd Battalion began a night march to Hill 163 arriving at 13:00 on 27 January. Operation D-Day 28 January was rainy with low clouds however the landings proceeded smoothly with BLT 3/1 Marines on Red Beach by 07:00. The landing was supported by naval gunfire support from and and air support from Marine Aircraft Group 11 and Marine Aircraft Group 12, however opposition was minimal. BLT 2/4 Marines and Battery H 3rd Battalion, 11th Marines landed by midday but worsening weather in the afternoon delayed further amphibious landings and buildup of forces ashore. The bad weather continued into 29 January. Company E 2/4 Marines left Hill 163 and rejoined the rest of their battalion. BLT 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines was landed by HMM-362 helicopters on Nui Xuong Giong (), a hill northwest of Red Beach, in the afternoon. Also on 29 January the 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines was flown into Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Airfield to exploit the results of the B-52 strikes scheduled for the next day. On 30 January, despite efforts by III MAF to postpone the B-52 strikes due to the bad weather, the B-52s hit targets in the Song Ve Valley (), but the Marines were unable to immediately follow up the strikes due to bad weather. That afternoon helicopters moved BLT 2/3 Marines further inland, completing their landing by 17:30. That same afternoon Marine Aircraft Group 36 established a helicopter forward operating base called \\"Johnson City\\" 400m inland from Red Beach. On 31 January the weather began to improve and the Marines began their westward sweep. Helicopters deployed Battery H, 3/11 Marines to BLT 2/3 Marines' position to provide fire support for the advance and that afternoon Company B, 2/4 Marines was landed on Hill 508 () a further southwest of BLT 2/3 Marines and the rest of 2/4 Marines was landed 2km further west in the Song Ve Valley itself. On 1 February the 2/9 Marines command group and 2 companies were landed by helicopters 7km northwest of 2/4 Marines and the 2 battalions began sweeping the valley. Meanwhile BLT 2/3 Marines searched to the west of Nui Xuong Giong. The Marines encountered only small groups of PAVN/VC who engaged in hit and run tactics, the only sizable encounter being two skirmishes by 3/1 Marines north of Red Beach killing 31 PAVN/VC. On 3 February BG Platt ordered his forces to move south in an attempt to press the PAVN/VC against the 1st Cavalry and ARVN in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province. On 11 February, after minimal results in their southern sweep, BG Platt ordered his forces to move back towards Red Beach/Johnson City. On 12 February a 4-man team from Company B, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion operating 11km northwest of Ba T∆° Camp observed a 31-man PAVN/VC force and called in artillery fire killing 10 of them, a further group of more than 80 PAVN/VC then arrived and the team requested helicopter extraction following which airstrikes were called in on the PAVN/VC. The limited results of the operation indicated that the PAVN/VC were not in the operational area in force and this was confirmed by prisoner interrogations that revealed that the units had left the area several days before D-Day. Aftermath Operation Double Eagle concluded on 17 February, the Marines had suffered 24 dead and had a body count of 312 PAVN/VC killed and 19 captured. A total of 18 individual weapons and 868 rounds of ammunition were recovered. On 19 February after receiving intelligence that the VC 1st Regiment was operating in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley to the north, BG Platt launched Operation Double Eagle II. BLT 2/3 Marines, 2/9 Marines and 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines were landed at landing zones in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley while 3/1 Marines took up blocking positions west of Tam K·ª≥. Over the next 10 days the Marines claimed to have killed 125 VC and captured 10 for the loss of 6 Marines killed. On the early morning of 28 February, VC disguised as ARVN soldiers attempted an attack on BG Platt's command post, the VC were identified at the last minute with 2 killed and 1 captured for the loss of 1 Marine killed. Operation Double Eagle II ended on 1 March. BG Platt regarded the operation as a success because it had inflicted severe damage to local VC forces, however Fleet Marine Force, Pacific commander LG Victor Krulak disagreed, believing that details of the operation had been leaked to the PAVN/VC who were able to withdraw their forces intact and that Vietnamese civilians saw that the Marines \\"would come in, comb the area and disappear; whereupon the VC would resurface and resume control.\\" References Double Eagle United States Marine Corps in the Vietnam War Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1966 History of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province ","title":"Operation Double Eagle"},{"id":"46569409","title":"List of members of the United States House of Representatives in the 32nd Congress by seniority"},{"id":"46569431","text":"Grant Hagan Hermanus (born 10 November 1995 in Cape Town, South Africa) is a South African rugby union player for in the Currie Cup and the Rugby Challenge.

Behind its simple statement of purpose lies the belief that carers should not just be allowed but should be welcomed, and that a collaboration between the patients and all connected with them is crucial to their health and their well-being. Alistair Burns, the national clinical director for dementia and mental health in older people with NHS England, said: ‚ÄúWe would encourage hospital trusts, as part of the care they provide to individuals with dementia and their families, to consider facilitating an approach whereby the families and carers of people with dementia can support them fully while they are in hospital.‚Äù In February 2014 Nicci Gerrard's father Dr John Gerrard, aged 86, spent five weeks in hospital for the treatment of leg ulcers. He suffered from Alzheimer's disease and his family's visiting was severely restricted because of a combination of normal \\"visiting hours\\" and an infectious outbreak. His condition deteriorated dramatically while he was in hospital; having previously been living well with Alzheimers he became \\"skeletal, incontinent, immobile, incoherent\\" and needed 24-hour care. He died in November 2014. His family believe that the lack of contact with familiar people and the lack of the individual attention they would have given him contributed significantly to his deterioration. In November 2014 Nicci Gerrard wrote an article in The Observer after her father's death, the following week's issue featured several supportive letters, and the campaign developed thereafter. An Early Day Motion was put before the UK Parliament in December 2014 with the title \\"John's Campaign and the right to stay with dementia patients in hospital.\\" The campaign has received coverage including the April 2015 edition of the Alzheimer's Society's magazine Living with Dementia and BBC Radio 4's You and Yours consumer programme on 29 April 2015. In March 2016 it was announced that the campaign had been endorsed by the NHS and that trusts would be encouraged \\"to consider facilitating an approach whereby the families and carers of people with dementia can support them fully while they are in hospital\\". Care homes and Covid-19 During the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic John's Campaign became concerned about the restrictions on visits to residents of care homes in England. In July 2020 John's Campaign was the lead signatory of a letter to the Secretary of State describing \\"The hidden catastrophe that is taking place in care homes\\" and stating that \\"there has ... been much suffering and a deterioration in mental and physical health among many of the residents because of the ban on all visitors\\".

In 1842 the \\"Asultos de Moro\\", the great raid in the Island of Mindoro, destroyed the first settlement in Bancuro by Moro invaders SAN AGUSTIN CHAPLAINCY MASS MEDIA ARCHIVES (2016) and because of this, the church served not only as a house of worship but also as a fort and refuge for the locals. In 1858, the capital of Naujan was transferred from Bancuro to \\"Bulwagan\\" Naujan. It was then became a pastoral community of San Nicolas de Tolentino Parish under the supervision of the Society of the Divine Word in 1937. In 2006, the San Agustin Chaplaincy took over the pastoral work of the Simbahang Bato. Archaeology In 2004, the University of the Philippines Archaeological Studies Program excavated in the church ruins with the goal of investigating the main settlement of Naujan, as mentioned in old written documents. Initially seen as a suspicious activity in the light of the looming 2004 national and local elections, the excavation contributed to the tourism sector later on when the municipal and provincial governments included the Bancuro Church Ruins in their list of tourist attractions.

He played an active role in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw Uprising. He was born in Pabianice, Poland and died aged 53 in exile in Montfermeil, Paris, France.http://www.um.pabianice.pl/informator-miejski/historia- miasta/wylowione-z-sieci/pluskowski; http://www.sprawiedliwi.org.pl/en/family/760,jozef-pluskowski/  Early life  J√≥zef was born to Julian Pluskowski and Agnieszka Dolewska in Pabianice, then under Prussian control. After studying at St Petersburg University and fluent in Polish, German, Russian, and French, he returned to Pabianice where he became a teacher. During this time, from 1914-1918, he acted as a liaison- member of the secret Polish Military Organisation (POW) formed by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. The Pabianice district history records, under the section on Peowiacy, presents a short memoir by Pluskowski of a clash with German police whilst curfew-breaking to hang POW posters in 1918. He also wrote a paper in 1932 entitled \\"Komendant J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudzki w walce o wolno≈õƒá Polski\\". In 1937 his contribution was acknowledged with the Cross of Independence (Krzy≈∫ Niepodleg≈Ço≈õci), awarded to individuals who had \\"fought heroically for the Independence of Poland\\". Among the various privileges, it gave recipients a right to be elected to the Senate of the Republic of Poland. Working in Warsaw as Inspector of Schools, he developed his ideas and published several volumes of poetry, including Na rubie≈ºach ≈õnie≈Ñ and P≈Çomienne dale, both by Editions M.

P≈Çomienne dale came out in a second edition that same year followed by Trubadur z kolorowych bajek, also by Fruchtman in 1939.Pluskowski, J. 1939. Trubadur z kolorowych bajek. Warsaw: M. Fruchtman.  Resistance and the Warsaw Ghetto  \\"Warsaw was said to have two special treasures: its mayor and its poets\\"Davies, N. 2004. Rising 44' 'The Battle for Warsaw. London: Pan. During the Nazi-Soviet invasions of 1939, Pluskowski was awarded the Cross of Valour (Krzy≈∫ Walecznych). This was certified by the legendary ex-mayor, Civilian Commissar Stefan Starzy≈Ñski, who had become the symbol of the defence of Warsaw. An early organiser of what became the Armja Krajowa (AK) resistance, Starzy≈Ñski is believed to have been shot at Dachau in October 1943. Pluskowski remained in Warsaw during the \\"Generalgouvernement\\" period when the Nazis, as described by his contemporary, the poet Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, divided the local population into those for quicker extermination (the Jews) and those assigned for slave labour. Mi≈Çosz wrote, \\"A generation was lost. Also cities. Nations.\\"Mi≈Çosz, C. 1953. Zniewolony umys≈Ç. Paris: Instytut Literacki, preface. An active underground state grew up in opposition where Pluskowski was \\"assigned\\" by his superiors to work in the ghetto.Friedman, P. 1957. Their Brothers Keepers. New York: Crown. He found the Jewish Underground, provided forged documents for many of their members, served as a liaison between the ghetto and the outside, was a source of valuable information and supplied the fighters with ammunition for the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. On one occasion, his wife supplied the ghetto with 97 grenades hidden in her fur coat. Pluskowski, who lived in the \\"Aryan\\" side, concealed eight Jewish families in his apartment and continued giving aid even after the Uprising had been crushed.Friedman, P. 1957. Their Brothers Keepers. New York: Crown. In a statement issued by the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Jewish Committee, 3 Dec 1946, Gustaw- Gerszen Miller testified that he and his family had been sheltered by the Pluskowskis in their multi-room home at 5 Elektoralna for over two and a half years, even though discovery would have meant instant execution for J√≥zef and his family as well, and had been present in an adjoining room when J√≥zef was interrogated by the Gestapo about smuggling Jews out of the ghetto and hiding them in Grodzisk and Warsaw. He further states that during a second series of interrogations, which lasted seven days, Pluskowski was tortured.Document in archives of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw Throughout this period of occupation, when teaching in Polish was forbidden, alongside its use in public meetings and cultural events, Pluskowski continued to write and participated in numerous clandestine poetry readings. His poems of that period, printed on a duplicating machine and circulated as broadsheets, were collected in 1944 as Z walki i pracy. Poezje.Pluskowski, J. 1944. Z walki i pracy. Poezje. Warsaw: Odbito na powielaczu (self-published). After readings, he always slept in different locations so as not to be identified or followed home.  Warsaw Uprising  Pluskowski participated in the Warsaw Uprising as lieutenant of the Polish Armed Forces and was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for valor, the Virtuti Militari, on 5 August 1944. He was captured on 7 August and, including a period of seven weeks in a concentration camp, remained in a POW camp in Gerolstein, Germany, until liberated by the Allies on 8 March 1945.Copy of the original documents in Polin; Museum of the History of Polish Jews, http://www.sprawiedliwi.org.pl/en/family/760,jozef- pluskowski/ His son, Andrzej, was born during the Warsaw Uprising on 23 September, as Pluskowski later wrote, \\"on a table, in our cellar, in the middle of a German bombardment\\". Although he was unable to see his son for the first time until after the war ended, he wrote a moving letter on his name- day, sent from the prison camp in Gerolstein, Germany. Earlier, on 11 November, he had written a \\"Letter from Captivity\\" poem, later collected as part of the Kolorowe listy series. Liberated in March 1945, Pluskowski was, shortly after, made commander of the Polish Guard Company alongside the US Army in Paris. He requested repatriation to Poland and returned via Reims/√âpernay on 15 November. Records state that he had been wounded three times. Warsaw having been totally destroyed, he joined his family in nearby Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki, and attempted to start a business enterprise. He was, however, quickly made unwelcome by the authorities, briefly imprisoned, and only rescued due to the efforts of the Jewish Underground group Bricha who spirited him over the Tatra Mountains to Czechoslovakia and eventually back to Paris.  Life in exile  On 26 August 1948, a certificate issued by the administrator of <≈öWIAT≈ÅO (√âdition La Lumi√®re)Archives of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Jewish Committee, now in the archives of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw at Rue d'Alsace guaranteed J√≥zef Pluskowski an appointment as editor for a period of 12 months, at a salary of 15000 Francs (Ff). There is also a residence record at 3, Rue Brey, and his French identity card /passport, issued December 1948, lists his profession as R√©dacteur-journaliste. In August 1948 the Bricha group arranged for his wife and son to leave Poland by train as Jewish immigrants travelling to the newly proclaimed State of Israel. They travelled on passports and papers issued to a Rachelle Miller and her son Adam. Not trusting a four year old to remember a change of name, Andrzej/Adam was instructed, if asked his name, to answer, \\"I don't remember\\", an answer he persisted with for many months afterwards. During this period, Pluskowski wrote poems of longing for his country, \\"Codzie≈Ñ Jestem w Kraju\\" (Every Day I am in My Country) and \\"Tƒôsknota za OjczyznƒÖ\\" (Longing for My Fatherland); a Parisian interlude \\"Paryskie Chimery\\" followed, describing times in favourite caf√©s and fishing in the River Marne (with his old friend Zygmunt Zaremba). Among his last poems is one addressed \\"Do ≈ªyd√≥w\\" (To the Jews) in which, having witnessed the horrors of the ghetto first-hand, he celebrated the creation of Eretz Yisrael, the Jewish homeland. By the end of 1949, he had assembled a last, carefully chosen selection from all his poetic writings entitled \\"DziewiƒôƒádziesiƒÖt Cztery Utwory Poetyckie\\" (94 Poetic Creations) by Edition Libella, Paris.A copy is kept in the French National Archives in Nanterre. Death and funeral A second son, Grzegorz was born and in October 1950, Pluskowski applied for immigration to the United States where he had distant relatives. His health had been steadily weakening, however, and he died of exhaustion in November at the age of 53. At his funeral, a broadsheet was circulated with an article he had written for the Polish Socialist Press, extolling \\"La Marseillaise\\" as a song that \\"since 1792 enflamed all those who had loved Freedom above all\\". It was entitled \\"Pie≈õ≈Ñ Purpurowa\\" (The Purple Song) and finished with the words, \\"always will the Marseillaise work its magic on people who long for Freedom and fight for it\\". When leaving Poland, Pluskowski had been entrusted with an ancient Torah scroll parchment by the Miller family to take to safety. He brought it with him to Paris. Following his death, his wife Irena was invited to come to Britain by former Polish President/Prime Minister in Exile, Mr Tomasz Arciszewski. She left the Torah scroll in Paris (with family friends, Mr and Mrs Neimann and Mr Z. Solski). Having settled into a teaching job in London with her children, in the late 1950s she instructed her Paris friends to bequeath the scroll to an appropriate Jewish institution. In 1968, J√≥zef Pluskowski - \\"MIERZWA\\" - was posthumously awarded the Armia Krajowa Cross (Krzy≈º Armii Krajowej), given to commemorate the soldiers of the Home Army (Armja Krajowa) between 1939-1945 and established by General B√≥r-Komorowski in 1966. In May 2015, J√≥zef Pluskowski was added to the list of the Polish Righteous by the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, POLIN, in Warsaw.http://www.sprawiedliwi.org.pl/en/family/760,jozef-pluskowski/ In March 2016, the Commission for Designation of the Righteous at Yad Vashem awarded J√≥zef Pluskowski and Irena Pluskowska the status of Righteous Among the Nations.

It is now the Englishmans Bed and Breakfast, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description and history The Archibald-Adams House is set on the west side of Main Street (between it and the Narraguagus River) a short way north of the village center of Cherryfield. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. A pair of brick chimneys rise from the interior of the house. The house has prominent facades facing both east, toward the road, and south, toward the village. Both of these facades are five bays wide, with a center entrance that has a distinctive surround. The south facade entry has flanking sidelight windows and pilasters, and is topped by a transom window and entablature, all in the Greek Revival style. The eastern entry has a simpler treatment, with no windows and an entablature with gabled pediment. The interior has retained much of its original late 19th-century woodwork and hardware. The house was built about 1795, probably by Thomas Archibald, who held a number of local civic offices between about 1790 and 1810. Archibald's daughter Elizabeth married Joseph Adams, who remarried into the locally prominent Campbell family after her untimely death in 1811. Adams was also prominent in civic affairs, serving as a justice of the peace, town selectman, and as a trustee of the Cherryfield Academy.

Burgess and Macellari had embarked on an affair while Burgess was married to his first wife, and Macellari gave birth to a son nine months after their meeting. The couple became tax exiles in the late 1960s, living in Malta and Italy, and spent several years in the United States. The couple finally settled in Monaco. Macellari played an important role in Burgess's later literary career, negotiating film rights and acting as his European literary agent, and translating his novels. Academic life Macellari was born in Porto Civitanova, Italy, in 1929. Her mother was an amateur poet and artist, Contessa Maria Lucrezia Pasi della Pergola, and her father was Gilberto Macellari, a photographer and actor. Her father died in the Second World War. Macellari had a sister who was later killed in a mountaineering accident. Macellari learnt the English language by reading the novelist Henry James. Macellari studied at the University of Bologna and the University of Paris and was the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship which enabled her to study literature in the United States, at Mount Holyoke College. Shortly after her move to America, Macellari met and married Benjamin Johnson, an African-American translator of Italo Svevo. Shortly after their marriage the couple separated and were finally divorced in 1967. After moving to Rome in the late 1950s Macellari founded a theatre company and after having an affair with Englishman Roy Halliday, moved to London with him. Halliday later drowned when sailing in the Atlantic ocean. It was while in Rome that Macellari started her Italian-language translation of Lawrence Durrell's fiction tetralogy The Alexandria Quartet. Macellari also translated James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. Life with Burgess In 1963 Macellari was tasked with creating a report on new English fiction for the Bompiani Literary Almanac, and in the course of her research, enthusiastically wrote to the authors of the novels A Clockwork Orange and Inside Mr. Enderby. Burgess was the author of both novels, having published Inside Mr. Enderby with the pseudonym of Joseph Kell. Macellari and Burgess met for lunch and began an affair, although Burgess was already married. Burgess was unhappily married to Llewela (Lynne) Isherwood Jones, who suffered from alcoholism, and Burgess apparently refused to leave her due to the offence he felt would be caused to George Dwyer, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds, who was his cousin. In 1964 Macellari's son, Paolo Andrea, was born. Her former partner, Roy Halliday, was named on the birth certificate as Paolo Andrea's father, and Burgess would later describe him shortly before his 1968 marriage to Macellari as his step- son. Burgess would also later be described as Paolo Andrea's father. Paolo Andrea died in 2002. Burgess's wife died in March 1968, and the couple married not long after. Macellari then ended her academic career at the University of Cambridge. Macellari had joined King's College, Cambridge to teach applied linguistics in 1967, and had made Italian-language translations of Thomas Pynchon's novels V. and The Crying of Lot 49. Macellari played an important role in the development of Burgess's literary career, being depicted as a fictional Italian photographer, Paola Lucrezia Belli, in his 1976 autobiographical novel Beard's Roman Women, and worked as his European literary agent from 1975. Her translation of his Malayan Trilogy received the Premio Scanno prize, and she also translated the sonnets of Giuseppe Gioachino Belli that were featured in his 1977 novel Abba Abba. She also sued the producers of the film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange, winning a 10% share of the film's profits which were worth more than $1 million. The couple left the United Kingdom in 1968 as a result of the income tax demands that Burgess now faced as a high earning writer, and traveled Europe in a Bedford Dormobile, with Burgess writing in the back of the vehicle while Liana drove. The couple next settled on the island of Malta, which they then left for a four-year tour of universities in the United States. While touring America she worked on her translation of Joyce's Finnegans Wake, retitled pHorbiCEtta by her. The Burgesses ultimately departed Malta in the aftermath of a lecture he had delivered that was poorly received by an audience of Catholic priests, and settled in Italy on the shore of Lake Bracciano, near Rome. The couple had experienced further problems with income tax following their move to Italy, having found difficulties in transferring money to Italy from the United Kingdom without incurring taxation in both countries. The couple settled in Monaco in 1974, moving to a large apartment at 44 Rue Grimaldi. The couple had decided to settle in the tax haven of Monaco as the country did not levy income tax and additionally, widows were exempt from death duties, a form of taxation on their husband's estates. The couple's move to Monaco accorded with her conviction that an author's earnings should be exempt from taxation. At the time of his death from lung cancer in 1993, Burgess was worth $3 million and owned 11 properties across Europe. The proceeds of these assets enabled Macellari to further the study and promotion of Burgess's work, and to fund the creation of the University of Angers's Anthony Burgess Centre and Manchester's International Anthony Burgess Foundation. She also donated ¬£200,000 to Liverpool Hope University to promote the study of her husband's work. In his obituary of Liana Macellari for The Guardian, Christopher Hawtree wrote that \\"Perhaps she fretted unduly about his posthumous reputation, but certainly without her, his best work might not have found its lucrative place among the most exhilarating postwar writing.\\" References * 1929 births 2007 deaths Academics of the University of Cambridge Fulbright Scholars Italian emigrants to Monaco Italian expatriates in England Italian expatriates in Malta Italian expatriates in the United States Italian translators Literary agents Mount Holyoke College alumni University of Bologna alumni University of Paris alumni 20th-century translators ","title":"Liana Burgess"},{"id":"46569705","text":"Hector is an unincorporated community in Putnam County, in the U.S. state of Ohio.

In the late 13th century, the Aegean Sea was a haven for piracy. In 1286, a group of pirates raided Tinos, a possession of the Ghisi family, and carried off a donkey. Although marked with the initials of its owner, it was then bought by William Sanudo, Lord of Syros and son and heir of Marco II Sanudo, Duke of the Archipelago. Learning of this, the Ghisi invaded Syros and besieged William in his castle. At the same time, however, an Angevin fleet made port in nearby Melos. As vassals of King Charles II of Naples, the Sanudi were entitled to his protection, and the entreaties of the lady of Melos, Cassandra Sanudo, bore fruit: making common cause with the Sanudo forces, the Angevins quickly forced the Ghisi to raise the siege. In the end, the issue of the donkey's ownership was referred to the Venetian bailo at Negroponte. The bailo managed to reconcile the two great families of the Archipelago and restore peace, but, as the historian of Frankish Greece William Miller observes, \\"only after 'more than 30,000 heavy soldi' had been expended for the sake of the animal, which had probably died in the interval\\".

A Steam Early Access version of the game was released on 27 April 2015, and the full version was released on 7 December 2015. PlayStation 4, Xbox One and physical PC DVD versions were released on 5 April 2016. The Linux and macOS versions, developed by Feral Interactive, were released on 2 March 2017. A sequel, Dirt Rally 2.0, was announced in September 2018 and released in February 2019.https://www.autosport.com/esports/news/138958/dirt- rally-20-release-announced  Gameplay  Dirt Rally is a racing video game focused on rallying. Players compete in timed stage events on tarmac and off- road terrain in varying weather conditions. On release, the game featured 17 cars, 36 stages from three real world locations - Monte Carlo, Powys and Argolis - and asynchronous multiplayer. Stages range from 4 to 16 km. Subsequent updates added three more locations in the form of Baumholder, J√§ms√§ and V√§rmland, as well as rallycross and player versus player multiplayer modes. Codemasters announced a partnership with the FIA World Rallycross Championship in July 2015, leading to the inclusion of the Lydden Hill Race Circuit (England), L√•nkebanen (Norway), and H√∂ljesbanan (Sweden) to the game. Dirt Rally features a large number of vehicles in a wide variety of classes, and 16 manufacturers. It contains cars from the 1960s, 70s, 80s, Group B, Group A, Group R, 2000s and 2010s modern rally, Rallycross and Pikes Peak, with cars having up to 10 liveries. In terms of image quality, a full 1080p resolution is delivered on both PS4 and Xbox One, with post-process anti- aliasing, along with matching art and effects work, whereas the PC version includes Steam Workshop that consists of preset setups made from each vehicles by users that helps benefit races from different terrains from different tracks (though the game holds up to 100 mods as subscribing to more than 100 mods will not function). Development Dirt Rally was developed by Codemasters using the in-house Ego engine. Development began with a small team of individuals following the release of their 2012 video game Dirt: Showdown. The team has emphasised a desire to create a simulation with Dirt Rally. They started by prototyping a handling model and creating tracks based on map data. The game employs a different physics model from previous titles, rebuilt from zero. An early version of Dirt Rally was showcased to journalists in late 2013, but the game wasn't officially announced until 27 April 2015. It was released later that day for Microsoft Windows in early access on digital distribution service Steam. Game director Paul Coleman stated that it was important to publicly release an unfinished build of the game so that the development team could get feedback from players. He expressed an interest in releasing Dirt Rally on consoles in the future but said that it was not possible currently with it being an early access game. Codemasters intended to introduce new cars, locations, and modes in monthly content updates, and make gameplay tweaks throughout the early access process. The full version of the game was released on 7 December 2015. The game was released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 5 April 2016. Reception Reception towards Dirt Rally was positive. GameStar gave the game 90% and said \\"Dirt Rally is the best rally simulation at the moment and one of the best racing games of all time. Beginners will find it to be quite difficult.\\" GamesTM celebrated the change of direction, saying \\"this is the best thing the 'Dirt' name has ever been associated with and rallying enthusiasts are sure to be relieved that the obsession with the kind of American slang that was only partially hip in the 90s has been overcome and removed.\\" Play magazine said \\"It doesn't patronise with gimmicky mechanics, nor is it a dry, joyless simulation\\". GameSpot praised the physics model, graphics, and the range of cars, but said that the \\"Hill Climb and Rallycross modes feel half-baked\\". Italian version of Eurogamer agreed too: \\"All we can hope for is new content - more cars and tracks.\\" GamesRadar highlighted the game's unforgiving nature, saying \\"Tires burst, radiators overheat, and you can frequently find yourself hobbling over the finish line with a slack time simply because you‚Äôve lost control of your car once in an otherwise clean and competitive race.\\" GamesMaster, Edge and IGN agreed. VideoGamer.com praised the game's \\"incredible speed\\", PlayStation Universe stated that it was better than Richard Burns Rally. Official PlayStation Magazine said it was \\"The most exhilarating driving game Codemasters has created in years, and undoubtedly the best rally game on PS4\\", with OXM adding \\"Without question the best rally sim ever made.\\" On the contrary, PC Gamer stated: \\"Unfortunately, though, in physics and handling detail, it falls a little flat. The lack of any sort of precarious feel when flying over ice and mud is an absolute shame, and the amount of forced assistance is a disappointment. Anyone waiting for a new Richard Burns will need to carry on waiting.\\" Evo praised the audio, saying \\"At times, Dirt Rally excels. The sound design in particular is excellent, as is the wide variety of cars on offer. The audio in Dirt Rally really does deserve special mention. Not only is it some of the best we‚Äôve heard in a racing game, it serves real purpose, with the co-driver almost perfectly matching his pace notes up with a stage\\". Of the graphics, they added \\"While it definitely can‚Äôt come close to the production values of the likes of a Gran Turismo title, there is a lot of visual flourishes that impress with Dirt Rally.\\" The Australian Official PlayStation Magazine said the game worked well with a steering wheel. Top Gear compared the game favorably to its rivals, stating \\"S√©bastien Loeb Rally Evo‚Äôs handling remains nowhere near as satisfying or convincing as Dirt Rally‚Äôs superlative scrambling\\". Stuff magazine stated that this was \\"a game that leaves WRC 5 eating gravel.\\" The game reached number 1 in the UK PS4 physical sales chart, and number 19 in the European download chart. It reached number 2 in the UK multiformat physical sales chart in its week of release, only behind Quantum Break. The month after the release, The Official PlayStation Magazine listed Dirt Rally as the 16th best PS4 game of all time.Hall of Fame listing, PlayStation Official Magazine, Future Publishing, May 2016 The Telegraph listed it in their top games of 2016. TechRadar included the game on their list of the \\"10 best racing games on PC\\". Octane magazine put it at #1 on their list of the best sim racing games. At the BAFTAs, the game was nominated for the award for best sports game of 2016. Game Informer gave it their award for best racing game of the year. Gameplanet listed it as one of their best games of the year. Alphr put Dirt Rally in their top 5 PS4 racing games. PCGamesN said it was in the top 3 most realistic PC racing games.

Hawkins travelled to Agra to negotiate consent for a factory from Emperor Jahangir in 1609. Life and career The eldest son of William Hawkins or Hawkyns (d. 1589) and nephew of Sir John Hawkins (1532‚Äì1595), he served in Sir Francis Drake's voyage to the South Sea in 1577, presumably in the Elizabeth with John Wynter, though possibly in the Golden Hind with Drake himself. In October 1581 he was nominated, apparently at the request of his uncle, then treasurer of the navy, as lieutenant to Edward Fenton, appointed to command an expedition for the East Indies and China, which sailed from England in May 1582. Notwithstanding the connection between Fenton and John Hawkyns, who had married sisters, there was from the first a bad feeling between him and William Hawkyns, arising partly no doubt out of jealousy of the claims which had been put forward on behalf of young Hawkyns to command the expedition over Fenton's head; partly also, it may be, out of the insolent and insubordinate conduct of Hawkyns himself; the feeling was doubtless intensified by the formal instruction to Fenton not to remove him \\"but upon just cause cause duly proved and by consent of your assistants\\". When the little fleet was sailing from Plymouth, Hawkyns was still on shore, and Fenton put to sea without him; he was brought out in the Francis, one of the squadron, and put on board his own ship, the Leicester. Throughout the voyage the captain and the lieutenant seem to have quarrelled and thwarted each other on every occasion, and the Leicester finally arrived in the Thames with Hawkyns in irons. It does not appear that John Hawkyns gave his nephew any support in this quarrel; for five years afterwards he was on terms of confidential friendship with Fenton. Hawkyns may probably be identified with the William Hawkyns who, in 1587, commanded the Advice on the coast of Ireland; and again with the William Hawkyns who, in 1588, commanded the Griffin against the Spanish Armada. It has been suggested that the commander of the Griffin was his father, then mayor of Plymouth; but this is impossible, for on 19 July the Griffin was at sea with Sir Francis Drake, and the mayor of Plymouth was on shore collecting reinforcements. Hawkins was, however, not an uncommon Devonshire name, and it is quite possible that the commander of the Advice or Griffin belonged to some other family. By his father's will in 1589 Hawkyns inherited an annuity of ¬£40. His uncle, Sir John Hawkyns, left him by will in 1595, besides a share of the prospective profits of the last fatal voyage to the West Indies, ¬£10 a year to be paid quarterly, \\"on condition that he do not alienate nor sell the same annuity nor rent-charge, or any part thereof, for otherwise this gift shall be void.\\" He left also legacies of ¬£100 to each of Hawkyns's children, to be payable \\"to every such child at the time of their marriage, or at the accomplishment of their several ages of eighteen years, which shall first happen.\\" From the wording of this clause it would seem probable that the children were girls; but we know nothing more of them. Nor do we certainly know anything more of Hawkyns himself, though he has been identified with the man of the same name who in 1607 commanded the East India Company's ship Hector on a voyage to Surat with William Keeling, and was charged with \\"his Majestys letters and presents to the princes and governors of Cambaya, on account of his experience and language\\". This William Hawkyns, on arriving at Surat, proceeded accordingly to Agra and the court of the Great Mughal Jahangir, which he reached in April 1609, and where he remained for nearly three years. According to the account given in his Journal the emperor took much pleasure in his conversation, and detained him, assigning him a handsome maintenance, estimated at upwards of ¬£3,000 a year, his serious occupation being to combat the intrigues of the Portuguese and to endeavour to obtain a formal permission for the establishment of an English factory at Surat. His favour with the emperor enabled him to overcome all difficulties, and the required license was given; it was the first distinct recognition of English commerce in the East. Jahangir was desirous of attaching him to the country and to his interests, and pressed him to marry a maid out of the palace. Such a wife could also ensure that his food was not poisoned since Jahangir had already told the Jesuits that if Hawkins \\"dyed by an extraordinary casualtie, they should rue for it.\\" Hawkins consented to the match, conditionally on her not being a Moor, and accordingly he took as his wife the daughter of an Armenian Christian. Afterwards, having fallen into some disfavour with the emperor, he was allowed to depart, and in this the Portuguese readily assisted him. He left Agra in November 1611, and three months later arrived at Surat, where he found Sir Henry Middleton, with whom he went to the Red Sea, and afterwards to Java. At Bantam he went on board the Thomas, part of the fleet under the overall command of John Saris, and in her sailed for England. She touched at the Cape of Good Hope in April 1613, and on the passage home, probably near the end of it, Hawkyns died. His remains were brought to Ireland and buried there. This Hawkyns was certainly a man of superior ability, and rendered valuable service to English commerce in procuring its formal recognition at Surat. But his identification with the nephew of Sir John Hawkyns is very unsatisfactory. It is not based on any evidence; and, indeed, what little evidence there is seems to point the opposite way. Fenton's lieutenant, if only by reason of his name and family, was a man of some consequence, and it is difficult to conceive that he could have been to the West Indies, or have gained experience in the East without any record remaining. Fenton's lieutenant had not a brother Charles , nor yet brothers Giles or Roger; the Mughal's friend seems to have had all three. A good deal was said in 1614 about the inheritance of the widow of Captain Hawkyns who died, apparently intestate, on board the Thomas, but nothing was claimed for any daughters by a former marriage. Another point is this: when, on the passage out in 1607, Captain Keeling called a council to consider the advisability of touching at Sierra Leone, it was resolved to do so, because \\"Sir Francis Drake and Captain Cavendish had made a favourable report\\" of it; but not a word was said about the much greater experience and knowledge of Sir John Hawkyns. All which tends to the conclusion that the Hawkyns of East Indian distinction was not the son and grandson of the mayors of Plymouth. Personal life Hawkins married Mariam Khan, an Armenian Christian who was the daughter of an influential merchant in the court of the Mughal Emperor Akbar by whom he does not seem to have had issue. The year after Hawkins death Mariam married Captain Gabriel Towerson and with him returned to India.

It was established in 1990 as the Wellcome Trust's History of Twentieth Century Medicine Group, and reconstituted in October 2010 as part of the School of History at Queen Mary University of London.http://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/items/hss/140113.htm  History  The project originated as The Wellcome Trust's History of Twentieth Century Medicine Group, and later functioned as the Academic Unit of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine. It was originally established at the Royal College of Physicians in 1990 and comprised Sir Christopher Booth (the Harveian Librarian) and Professor Tilli Tansey. Its purpose was to devise ways of stimulating historians, scientists & clinicians to discuss, preserve and write the history of recent biomedicine. The Group's activities were originally overseen by a Programme Committee, which included professional historians of medicine, practising scientists and clinicians. From 2000‚Äì2010 it was a constituent part of the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London. In October 2010 it moved to the School of History, Queen Mary's University, London. In 2011 the Group received a Strategic Award from the Wellcome Trust to embark upon a new project, \\"Makers of Modern Biomedicine\\".  Outputs  An archive of oral and written history, plus videoed interviews, has been compiled by the HoMBRG and consists of three projects: Witness Seminars, Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History and SAD at 30. All material and documentation related to the project is deposited with the Wellcome Library. The resultant publications are open access, and made freely available online via the HoMBRG website, a partnership with the Medical Heritage Library, and iTunes. The topics covered by the archive fall broadly into five themes: clinical genetics, neuroscience, global health and infectious diseases, medical technologies and ethics of research and practice. Resources from the archive are online at The History of Modern Biomedicine Archive and the internet archivehttps://archive.org/search.php?query=publisher%3A%22London%3A+The+History+of+Modern+Biomedicine+Research+Group+at+UCL%22  Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History  The Group's 'Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History' initiative (2006-2008) was funded by a Wellcome Trust Public Engagement grant. It recorded interviews on three themes, neuropharmacology, psychiatry/neuropsychology, and neuroimaging, with twelve neuroscientists, including Geoffrey Burnstock, Salvador Moncada, Michael Rutter and Uta Frith.  The Witness Seminars  A series of witness seminars began in 1993, with regular meetings being held, about four per year. These recorded the voices of those who have contributed, in diverse ways, to the development of modern biomedicine, using oral history methodology. The aim is to make the series widely available for education, research and outreach purposes. The results are published online, with most edited transcripts appearing within 18 months. Witness Seminar participants have included Usama Abdulla, Thomas Brown, Professor Dugald Cameron, Professor Stuart Campbell, John Fleming, Professor John MacVicar, Professor Peter Wells, Dr James Willocks, Sir Douglas Black, Sir John Gray, Sir Raymond Hoffenberg, Dr Sheila Howarth, Professor Peter Lachmann, Sir Patrick Nairne, Professor Sir Stanley Peart, Dr Peter Williams and Professor Anthony PM Coxon. Each witness seminar is transcribed and published by HoMBRG.http://www.medicalheritage.org/2014/10/mhl-partner-history-of-modern- biomedicine-research-group-celebrates-21st-anniversary/ Recent volumes have been edited by E M Jones, C Overy and E M Tansey. there are 62 Volumes. Titles include The Development of Brain Banks, Narrative Medicine; Migraine; The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles; and The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) The publication of these works are often referred to by specialists in their fields of medical practice. The first two volumes were reviewed in Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1999, with the comment, \\"Few books are so intellectually stimulating or uplifting.\\" Reviewing the series in the British Medical Journal in 2002, medical historian Irvine Loudon wrote, \\"This is oral history at its best...all the volumes make compulsive reading...they are, primarily, important historical records In 2014 a seminar, chaired by Professor Sir Brian Follett, with Norman Rosenthal and Alfred Lewy, entitled 'The Recent History of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): 30 Years of SAD' was undertaken on the topic of Seasonal Affective Disorder. This resulted in a number of podcasts, and Volume 51 of the Witness Seminar publications.  Clips and Conversations  In 2015 the Group began producing oral history interviews with notable scientists and clinicians. This material is made freely available on YouTube (in the case of video interviews) and the Group's website, as are the transcripts of both audio and video interviews.

It is one of Australia's few working traditional windmills. The Lily is a 16th-century Dutch design windmill of brick construction with diameter sails. It was built by Dutch born Pleun Hitzert between 1991 and 1997. The Lily is a flour mill equipped with one set of millstones. It is the only working windmill of traditional construction on mainland Australia. Its uniqueness in the Australian landscape combined with the proximity of the Stirling Range has made The Lily a popular tourist landmark. The Lily with Stirling Range  Design  View inside the cap of The Lily The design of The Lily is inspired by several windmills from the Netherlands but most notably by that of De Lelie (Dutch for \\"The Lily\\") located in Puttershoek. The tapering brick tower of The Lily is five storeys high and is of circular cross section. The tower measures in excess of from the base of the footing to the cap bearing plate. The wall thickness varies between and . The cap has a mass of approximately and is able to rotate through a full 360 degrees to face the wind. The Common sails are of welded steel stock construction with Russian larch latticework. Canvas sails can be fitted over the latticework to catch more wind and improve the power the windmill can generate. The Lily has diameter sails with stocks constructed of welded steel rectangular sections. In strong wind the sails can revolve at around 25 rpm, at which speed the sail tips are travelling at more than . The Lily is equipped with one set of millstones for producing flour. Note that of the two millstones, only the top stone rotates. The gap between the stationary (bottom) stone and the top (rotating) stone can be manually controlled via a rope and pulley system and automatically via a centrifugal governor.  Gear train  As in many windmills, The Lily features two sets of gears between the sails and the millstones. The first one is between the brake wheel and the wallower which have 63 and 29 teeth respectively. The second gear is formed by the great spur wheel and the stone nut which have 66 and 23 teeth respectively. The number of teeth in each gear has been designed to be coprime to ensure even wear and smooth running of these gears. Both gears together provide a speed increasing gear ratio between sails and millstone of ‚âà6.2. This means that one complete revolution of the sails causes approximately 6.2 revolutions of the (top) millstone. cross section of The Lily  Brake  The Lily features a Flemish brake design which incorporates a rope drum which lifts a loaded lever which in turn pulls a set of wooden blocks tightly around the windshaft (the shaft the sails are mounted on). This brake design which is similar to a band brake is very effective when the sails are facing the wind, but much less so when the wind is coming from behind. For this reason a ‚Äòkneppel‚Äô is installed which prevents counter-rotation of the sails when the windmill has stopped.  Windshaft bearings  The rotating assembly of stocks, sails, windshaft, brake wheel etc. is supported on two bearings. The neck bearing supports by far the largest fraction of the weight. This is a plain bearing which supports the majority of the vertical component of the weight of the rotating assembly. The bearing block is of solid brass construction and is lubricated with animal fat. The shaft lays in a shallow groove of the neck bearing block and is kept in position by the weight of the rotating assembly. The tail bearing supports the remainder of the vertical weight and any (horizontal) thrust generated by the wind. The neck bearing does not react any thrust forces.  Construction  All the main parts of The Lily except the millstones have been constructed in the period between 1991 and 1997 virtually single-handedly by Pleun Hitzert. In preparation for building The Lily, Pleun travelled to the Netherlands to work with experienced millwrights in order to learn how to operate and build a windmill. Even though the windmill was essentially complete in 1997, no millstones were fitted at that time. This was because at that time The Lily restaurant and cafe occupied the bottom three floors of the windmill. It wasn‚Äôt until a new restaurant (housed in the re-constructed Gnowangerup railway station building) was constructed next to the windmill that the flour milling equipment could be fitted in the windmill. This work was carried out in 2003 after which The Lily produced its first flour, from grains grown on the property that surrounds the mill. Millstone in The Lily  Recycled material use  Extensive use has been made of recycled materials for the construction of The Lily. * The brick tower was constructed with handmade bricks from the Broomehill co-op store, which was destroyed by fire in 1991. These bricks were transported to The Lily's construction site and cleaned there by hand. * The structural timbers were sourced from the old Albany deep water jetty and from old telephone poles, both of which are made of native Australian wood. * The tail has been made from the stock of a sail of the windmill Landzigt in the Netherlands which was destroyed by a fire in 1990. * Cross-arms from telephone poles were used for the flooring. The brick tower of The Lily windmill under construction  Operation  The Lily can be operated by one person, but during milling the assistance of a second person is desirable. Due to its location The Lily can mill flour during most times of the year, as good winds are frequently available. Although the milling stones can be used to mill a large variety of wheat, it is almost exclusively used to produce spelt flour.

Early life and career Born on August 21, 1858, Viljoen was raised at Middelplaas, Caledon, and was the only one of his 10 siblings to be properly educated, matriculating at the South African College school in Cape Town. He studied medicine eventually at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle. He travelled in Europe and studied a range of agricultural practices too. On returning to South Africa, he served as District Surgeon in Caledon, where he met and married his wife Margaretha Johanna Jacoba (Maggie) Beyers. The couple had three daughters, Maria Elizabeth Anna (who died at age 8 years), Johanna Jakobmina Kurgerina (Hannah) (married to Rawbone), and Oaklene Savoye Marguerite (married to Hewat). Elgin farming (1898‚Äì1918) The undulating hills of the vast Elgin valley - source of much of South Africa's deciduous fruit exports. In the 1880s he lived and worked in the Transvaal Republic, and served as pres Paul Kruger's personal surgeon (one of his daughters was named \\"Krugerina\\" after Paul Kruger) and with the money he earned there, he bought farmland in the Elgin Valley in 1898, part of which was the Oak Valley farm. He spent much of the next few years under house arrest on his farm (he had signed up as a medical officer with the Boer army, during the Anglo-Boer war, and was soon captured by the British. His internment on Oak Valley was only granted on condition that he paid for the services of two British soldiers to guard him for the duration of the war!) Antonie Viljoen was a farmer extraordinaire growing everything from grape vines to potatoes. Among his many farming achievements were the purchase of the first deciduous fruit trees in the Elgin valley after realising that the area was ideally suited for the cultivation of apples and pears. He is regarded as the pioneer to establish the apple industry of the region. These were initially grown and maintained by his farm labourers, largely as their own separate concern, however they constituted the first known deciduous orchard in the region.C.

Penstock Publishing, South Africa. 2015. . The Elgin Wine Region, Oak Valley Estate. p.150. Political career Viljoen was elected to the Legislative Council (Upper House) of the Cape Parliament in 1903, for the South Western Circle. For the year he was on the council, he worked primarily on healing the wounds between the English and Afrikaner ethnic groups after the Anglo-Boer War. In 1904 he was elected to the House of Assembly (Lower House) of the Cape Parliament, for the Caledon district. In this capacity, he worked on conservation (banning the sale of certain species of wild flower, and cooperating on the founding of Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden). Viljoen was part of a liberal grouping in parliament, who strongly supported women's suffrage and the extension of the multi-racial Cape Qualified Franchise. His most famous contribution was in being part of the first attempt to extend the vote to women of all races, with fellow MPs JW Sauer and James Molteno on 4 July 1907. Viljoen was in fact the MP who first tabled the motion.C. Schoeman: The Historical Overberg. Traces of the Past in South Africa's Southernmost Region. Penguin Random House South Africa. 2017. p.28. At the formation of the Union of South Africa, he was also elected to the Senate, where he continued his policies of pushing for a more inclusive, multi-racial, and gender-sensitive future for the country. He was knighted by the British king in 1916. The Viljoen pass between Elgin and Villiersdorp is named after him. His descendants still farm on Oak Valley, Elgin, under the surname Rawbone-Viljoen after the husband of his daughter Johannah Jakobmina Krugerina, George Crundwell Rawbone, changed the family's surname to Rawbone- Viljoen to comply with Viljoen's will and testament, viz that the farm can only be inherited by a descendant who bears the surname \\"Viljoen\\". Later life In later life he served on the boards of Old Mutual and the National Bank of South Africa. He was knighted in 1916, and died at his Oak Valley farm in Elgin in 1918.

This protein is conserved all the way back to invertebrates. Proteins containing WD transducin repeating domains have been found to play a role in a variety of functions ranging from signal transduction and transcription regulation to cell cycle control, autophagy and apoptosis.  Gene  Human chromosomal position of WDR90 gene on the short arm of chromosome 16 In the human genome, WDR90 spans from base pairs 649363 to 667833, and has an mRNA sequence that is 5,250 nucleotides in length. This gene consists of 41 exons and encodes for a 1,750 amino acid protein in humans.  Locus  This human gene is located in the positive DNA strand on chromosome 16 at the position 16p13.3. Flanking sequences on the positive strand include FAM195A and RHOT2.  Aliases  Aliases for WDR90 include: C16orf15, C16orf16, C16orf17, C16orf18, C16orf19, and KIAA1924.  Homology   Paralogs  One human paralog for WDR90 has been found. This paralog is known as WDR16. According to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, WDR16 may play an essential role in growth or survival of hepatocellular carcinoma. This protein in humans if 620 amino acids long.  Orthologs  Orthologs for protein WDR90 are found conserved all the way back to single invertebrates.

There is a domain of unknown function called DUF667 that is conserved across its 30 predicted isoforms.Domains and locations on the human WDR90 gene.  Post- translational modifications  WDR90 is predicted to be a heavily phosphorylated protein.  Domains and motifs  There are three domains that repeat throughout the human sequence. Protein WDR90 primary amino acid sequence and its internal features/structures.  Secondary Structure  The de novo protein structure of WDR90 in humans is predicted to possess beta sheets, beta turns, and random coils. Predicted structure of WDR90 using the program Phyre2. There is a distinctive 7-bladed beta propeller present.  Tertiary and Quaternary Structure  The human protein WDR90 adopts a 7-bladed beta propeller that is indicative of the WD40 repeat family. This structure was predicted with 100% confidence by the structure predicting program Phyre2.  Interacting Proteins  The most notable proteins that interact with human WDR90 are predicted to be UTY, KDM6B, SETD1B, and ASH2L. These proteins are primarily found as histone modifiers.  Transcription Factors  The promoter for WDR90 in humans has been predicted to have domains for the transcription factors: ARNT, AP-1, MYB, and Cis2His2.  Expression  Expression levels of human WDR90 appear to be relatively constituent in low levels, with its highest levels in the lymph nodes and thymus. The expression of WDR90 in development is the highest in blastocyst and fetal stages. Expression is notably absent from the neonatal and infant stages, then comes back during juvenile and persists through adulthood.  Function  The function of WDR90 in humans in not well known. Given its broad expression in many tissues, its ties to the protein superfamily WD40 domain- containing proteins, and the known protein interactions, it could play a role in histone modifications, vesicular transport, or transcription regulation.

E. Housman‚Äôs death in 1936, his brother Laurence was made his literary executor and over the next two years published further selections of poems from his manuscripts: in 1936 More Poems and, between 1937-9, Additional Poems, although the latter were never printed as a separate edition. As much more of Housman's earlier writing was brought to light, its autobiographical nature clarified his suppressed homosexuality. There are also recognisable Classical influences. Editing Cover design by Francis Todd for the U.S. edition of More Poems In the preface to More Poems, Laurence Housman quoted the following instructions from the poet's will: : \\"I permit [my brother] but do not enjoin him to select from my verse manuscript writing, and to publish, any poems which appear to him to be completed and to be not inferior to the average of my published poems; and I direct him to destroy all other poems and fragments of verse.\\" Only two collections of A. E. Housman's poems had been published at widely separated intervals during his lifetime, A Shropshire Lad (1896) and Last Poems (1922). Laurence published a further 49 poems in More Poems on 26 October 1936, only a few months after the poet's death. The first impression was of 8,856 copies, followed immediately by a second impression of 5081; a later corrected third printing of 7,500 followed that.Haber 1955, pp.41-2 The American edition published that year had several textual differences to the British original.Ricks 1988, p.492 A further selection of 18 poems under the title Additional Poems appeared in Laurence's memoir My Brother, A.E. Housman (1937), together with his light verse and parodies and a selection of letters. Five more poems (three from old periodicals) were added to these in the Collected Poems of 1939. Subsequent scholarship, most notably by Tom Burns Haber in The Manuscript Poems of A. E. Housman (1955) and Archie Burnett in his edition of The Poems of A. E. Housman (1997), has deprecated Laurence's editing. Burnett charged that ‚ÄúThe text of many poems was misrepresented: poems not completed by Housman were printed as though complete; versions he cancelled were reinstated; separate texts were conflated; and many poems were mistranscribed from the manuscripts.‚ÄùArchie Burnett, notes to A Shropshire Lad and Other Poems, Penguin 2010, p.xxxi  The poems  Several poems in Laurence's selection for More Poems had already been considered by Housman for his previous collections, even reaching the page proof stage, before being rejected as not meeting his editorial aims there. Among them was the earnest ‚ÄúThe Sage to the Young Man‚Äù (4), with its old fashioned forms of address, originally destined for A Shropshire Lad. It had, however, been published anonymously at a later date in the school magazine The Edwardian (April 1916).Haber 1955, p.32 Five more, Poems 18, 26, 33, 45 and 46, had been intended for Last Poems.Ricks 1988, pp.494-5 Among work taken from old publications, Poem 48 was one of the earliest, having appeared as ‚ÄúParta Quies‚Äù, under his initials only, in Waifs and Strays (March 1881). With textual variants, it was retitled ‚ÄúAlta Quies‚Äù for More Poems but the original title and text were restored in Collected Poems (1939).Ricks 1988, p.496 One of the notable qualitative differences between More Poems and the earlier collections was the greater use of a personal voice, unmediated by such fictitious masks as the rustic ‚ÄòShropshire Lad‚Äô, on which Laurence commented himself in his memoir: ‚ÄúI found that most of these were more autobiographical than any that had appeared previously,‚Äù citing in particular Poems 30-33.Carol Efrati, The Road of Danger, Guilt and Shame, Associated University Presses 2002, p.338 The first two of those poems have been taken to refer to the break in relations with Moses Jackson.Steven Payne, Carrying the Torch, Xlibris 2010, pp.263-67 The intimations of homosexual feelings there were reinforced by the publication of ‚ÄúOh who is this young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists‚Äù, Poem 18 in Additional Poems, for which there is evidence that it shows sympathy for Oscar Wilde at the time of his trial in 1895.Haber 1955, p.ix Other personal themes occur towards the end of More Poems. ‚ÄúFarewell to name and number‚Äù (40) commemorates, not the death of an anonymous soldier but that of Housman's brother George Herbert in October 1901 during the Second Boer War.Haber 1955, p.x Again, the initials ‚ÄúA. J. J.‚Äù (42) conceal those of Housman's friend Adalbert Jackson who died on 12 November 1892.Ricks 1988, p.495 In the case of ‚ÄúFor my Funeral‚Äù (47), Housman was anticipating his own death. In a sealed envelope with that title had appeared instructions that the poem should be used during his funeral service. It was accordingly printed in the four page sheet with the service order on 4 May 1936, when it was sung in Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge. It also appeared in the Evening Standard for that date.Haber 1955, pp.39-40 Evidence that the poem was written more than a decade before that event is given by the appearance of a translation into Latin alcaics which was published by his colleague Allen Beville Ramsay in Ros Rosarum in 1925.David Butterfield, ‚ÄúClassical verse translations of the poetry of Housman‚Äù, Housman Society Journal 2011, pp.185-8 Classical influences Although Housman insisted on the separation between his work as a professor of Latin and his writing as a private person, and specifically denied all but the most superficial influence of his Classical learning on The Shropshire Lad,Richard Stokes, The Penguin Book of English Song, 2016, p.li this was not true of his other published work. Already in Later Poems there had appeared ‚ÄúEpithalamium‚Äù (24), with its Classical references and form, contiguous to ‚ÄúThe Oracles‚Äù (25), which has the Battle of Thermopylae as its subject.Introduction to the poem by Caroline Jackson-Houlston, Oxford Brookes University The story of ‚ÄùAtys‚Äù opens Additional Poems. The account was available to Housman in Herodotus,John Wright, ‚ÄúA source of A. E. Housman‚Äôs \\"The Land of Biscay\\"\\", Victorian Poetry 8.4, West Virginia University 1970, p.341 but in this case he has made of it a dialogue in the manner of a Border ballad. In More Poems, ‚ÄúDiffugere Nives‚Äù is a translation of one of Horace‚Äôs Odes and had already been published in Quarto (Vol. 3, 1897) in the year following the appearance of A Shropshire Lad.Ricks 1988, p.494 Another poem, ‚ÄúCrossing alone the nighted ferry‚Äù (23), is based on ancient Greek beliefs about the journey to Hades, the land of death. Song settings Of the 49 texts in Last Poems, thirteen still remain unset by composers. Thirty separate settings are due to the enthusiasm of John Ramsden Williamson (1929-2015), who also compiled some into two cycles. 4 Housman Songs (2001) included single poems from A Shropshire Lad and Additional Poems as well as Poems 43 and 19 from More Poems; 3 More Housman Songs (for baritone and piano, 2004) contained ‚ÄúParta Quies‚Äù (48) from More Poems and two more from Additional Poems. Other song-sets also combine poems from more than one of Housman's collections. Of the five in Jake Heggie‚Äôs Here and Gone (2005), two are from Last Poems and three from More Poems (14, 7 and 31); in Green Buds (1954) by Leslie Mann (1923-77), there are two from A Shropshire Lad and two from More Poems: Poem 9, which has been given the cycle‚Äôs title, and Poem 19, retitled ‚ÄúThe Mill Stream‚Äù; in Peggy Glanville-Hicks‚Äô 5 Songs for medium voice and piano (1952), the first two pieces are from Additional Poems, while the other three are Poems 7, 12 and 29 from More Poems. Jan Meyerowitz‚Äôs 2 Choruses (1957) for male voices and horn are settings of poems about death and burial (14 and 24) from More Poems alone.Lieder Net Archive References Bibliography Tom Burns Haber, The Manuscript Poems of A.

The company was named an Intangible Cultural Asset by the city of Tokyo and an Intangible Folk Custom Cultural Asset by the Japanese government. Since the mid 1990s, the company has been directed by Koryu Nishikawa V, who has brought the art form to international attention, touring mostly Europe and the Americas. Kuruma Ningyo puppetry Kuruma Ningyo puppetry is a style of puppet manipulation. As it is derived from the older bunraku, it is part of Japanese theatrical heritage, which has its origin in religious artistic expression. For this reason, it is not a form of children‚Äôs entertainment like in the West, but rather a form of entertainment for the masses, performing stories from classical Japanese literature and famous events of the Edo period (19th century) Japan. Performances begin with the sanbaso, a puppet dance which seeks to clear the stage of bad energy and acts as a petition for the show's success. Like bunraku, the performance of the puppets on stage is accompanied by shinnai musicians (generally one singer and one shamisen player), one main chanting narrator (tayuu) and an assistant. The music of the three-stringed shamisen is to highlight background themes, emotions and other non-verbal elements. What distinguishes kuruma ningyo from its predecessor is how the puppets are manipulated on stage. Kuruma is from rokuro-kuruma (a small seat with wheels) and ningyo means \\"puppet\\", thus \\"puppet on a cart\\". Large puppets over a meter tall are placed in front of a single puppeteer, dressed in black, who is seated on the wheeled vehicle. The use of this seat means that there is one puppeteer per puppet, unlike the three needed for bunraku, . and also allows movement of the puppets over the entire stage, rather a limited horizontal plane. The attachment of the puppet to the front of the black-clad person, also allows the puppeteer to match elements such as hands, feet and head for more realistic movement, such as walking feet, allowing an easier illusion of the puppet moving on its own. The right hand of the puppet is controlled by the right hand of the puppeteer, and the feet are attached correspondingly by the puppeteer's toes grasping pegs under the feet of the puppet. The heads are attached by a thin black cord that allows corresponding head movement. While the left hand is used to manipulate the left hand of the puppet, it is also used to manipulate the eyelids and/or mouth of the puppet. When this is required, the puppeteer must manipulate both arms with the right hand, making this style of puppetry more difficult. Much of its traditional repertoire is similar to that performed in the 19th century, using traditional music, stories and scenery. The company regularly performs with Shinnai Joruri Narrative Song master Tsuruga Wakasanojo XI, who has been designated a Living National Treasure (Bearer of Intangible Cultural Property). This title is held by only about 100 people in all artistic and craft endeavors in Japan. However, under its current director it has experimented with non-traditional elements and story lines. The troupe has performed with a female gidayu (chanter/narrator), something that is rare. It also has higher quality set design and more sophisticated lighting than most puppet theater productions. History of the Hachioji company Kuruma ningyo refers to the puppetry technique, developed starting in 1872 by the Nishikawa family. Hachioji is the name of the company, and is taken from the name of the suburb in western Tokyo, where the troupe‚Äôs headquarters is located. Since its inception, the art has been passed down through five generations, with all of the directors named after the original founder Koryu Nishikawa I. Starting in the mid 1990s, the company began to have international performances, touring extensively in Europe, Asia and the America. They have performed in countries such as Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Russia, Canada, the United States and Saipan, along with most of Japan. For the shows in Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, the company received the Florencia S√°nchez Prize for the best foreign performance at the International Theater Festival in Uruguay. In 2014, the company was invited to represent Japan at the 42nd Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico. The Hachioji Kuruma Ningyo was designated at an Intangible Cultural Asset by the city of Tokyo in 1962 and later an Intangible Folk Custom Cultural Asset by the national government. Koryu Nishikawa V The current director (iemoto) of the Hachioji Kuruma Ningyo is Koryu Nishikawa, the fifth generation with this name and this occupation, taking on the role in 1996. He began studying kuruma ningyo puppetry when he was thirteen years old, apprenticing under his grandfather and father. Later he studied bunraku at the School of the National Bunraku Theater. Nishikawa V has internationalized the company and its productions to a degree because of his international experience. He learned from working with Michael Meschke‚Äôs theater company in Stockholm and his work shows influence from this time teaching at the Marionette Theater Institute in Sweden in 1987. This includes productions aimed at international audiences and foreign elements such as flamenco dancers. Nishikawa carries on the tradition not only to the next generations of his family, but also to young people in Japan, establishing the Passing Traditional Puppetry to Next Generation puppet festival to promote traditional Japanese puppetry. In 2004, his hometown named him their cultural ambassador.

CCDC176 is neighbored by ALDH6A1 and ENTPD5 at the same locus. The mRNA is 3123 base pairs long and has 12 exons, the protein is 529 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of 61987 Da and a predicted isoelectric point of 9.07 in humans. Homology and evolution CCDC176 has no known paralogs and is orthologous in primates, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, all the way back to invertebrates, a fungi parasite and a proteobacteria. The domain found to be homologous is the DUF4515, a domain of unknown function. Protein function and characteristics This basal body protein has been shown in multiciliated cells to align and maintain cilia orientation in response to flow. This protein may also act by mediating a maturation step that stabilizes and aligns cilia orientation. No other genes or proteins have been found that encode basal body orientation factors. A similar set of genes, tubulin tyrosine ligase-like genes 3 and 6, has been found in zebrafish that maintain cilia structure and motility. These genes belong to the TTL (tubulin tyrosine ligase) family. BBOF1 has two coiled coil domains, one that is 117 amino acids in length at the position 85-201 and the second is 91 amino acids in length at the position 271-361. There is also a region of interest located at the position 77-270 and is named DUF4515, a domain of unknown function belonging to the family of pfam14988. There are three predicted protein- protein interactions concerning CCDC176. The most prevalent and most likely interaction is with LIG4, a human gene that encodes the protein DNA Ligase IV. Two experiments in a publication of 1030 unique reactions support the LIG4-CCDC176 interaction.http://thebiogrid.org/149877/publication/charting- the-landscape-of-tandem-brct-domain-mediated-protein- interactions.html The second and third predicted interactions are NRF1 and HYLS1. The predicted secondary structure of BBOF1 in humans is as follows: 87.1% alpha helix, 63.9% beta sheet, and 15.7% beta turn. Expression, research, and clinical significance CCDC176 has known expression in the human testis, cerebellum, and lung tissues. There are six articles of research related to the gene CCDC176, with four out of six being large-scale sequencing, one article not naming the gene or protein, and one article with only the abstract available. This last article, Global, in vivo, and site-specific phosphorylation dynamics in signaling networks, is the only article that directly mentions the protein of interest and it does so only once. This study detected 6,600 phosphorylation sites on 2,244 proteins. Expression data from different health states in humans predicts high expression of CCDC176 in glioma. The interaction data concerning CCDC176 and LIG4 came from a publication studying protein-protein interaction involved with the DNA damage response network in association with cancerhttp://thebiogrid.org/149877/publication/charting-the- landscape-of-tandem-brct-domain-mediated-protein- interactions.html  References  Human proteins ","title":"CCDC176"},{"id":"46570388","title":"2015 African Youth Athletics Championships"},{"id":"46570424","text":"Kellam Road and Constitution Drive were two planned light rail stations on the proposed Tide Light Rail line extension towards Virginia Beach, Virginia, U.S., These stations, along with Witchduck Road was to open in late 2019 or early 2020, however, due to the 2016 Virginia Beach City referendum regarding light rail being a no-majority, work on light rail has been ceased as of December 2016.

It is named after Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena, the Grand Master who commissioned it. It was built between 1726 and 1728 to designs of the French architect Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion, on the site of the meeting place of the Universit√†. The palace was used a hospital in the 19th and 20th centuries, and it became known as Connaught Hospital after 1909. Since 1973, it has been open to the public as Malta's National Museum of Natural History. History Background and construction The site of Vilhena Palace has been inhabited since ancient times, and post-Punic remains have been found in the area. In around the 8th century, a Byzantine fort was probably built on the site, and in the Middle Ages it developed into a castle known as the Castellu di la Chitati. The castle's inner walls were demolished in the 15th century, and the remaining part was built up as a palace by Grand Master Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam in the 1530s. The palace was called the Palazzo Giuratale, and it housed the civil administrative council known as the Universit√†. The structure was damaged in the 1693 Sicily earthquake. Interior of the palace On 3 November 1722, the newly elected Grand Master, Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena, issued orders for the restoration and renovation of Mdina. The city entrance was completely rebuilt, and the seat of the Universit√† was demolished to make way for a summer palace for the Grand Master. A new Banca Giuratale was built to house the Universit√† following the demolition of its meeting place. Construction of Vilhena's new palace began in 1726, and it was completed two years later in 1728. The building was designed by Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion in the French Baroque style that was popular in Parisian h√¥tel palaces, and it was constructed under the supervision of the Maltese capomastro Petruzzo Debono. Hospital The palace served as a temporary hospital during a cholera outbreak in 1837. On 12 June 1860, the palace was converted into a sanatorium by the British military. The palace was leased for ¬£160 a year, and conversion of the building into a hospital cost less than ¬£1000. The hospital was temporarily closed down in 1890, and it briefly served as a barracks. It reopened soon afterwards, and was finally closed down in 1907. The palace was reopened by King Edward VII on 22 April 1909, as a hospital for patients suffering from tuberculosis. It was known as Connaught Hospital after Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, who donated ¬£800 to buy new equipment for the hospital. The hospital was closed down in 1956. Museum National Museum of Natural History The palace was inaugurated as the National Museum of Natural History on 22 June 1973. Its collections include samples of flora and fauna, fossils, rocks, minerals and dioramas of Maltese habitats. The palace's forecourt was restored in the early 2000s at a cost of around Lm46,000. It was inaugurated by the President of Malta, Guido de Marco, in July 2002. The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. It is now a Grade 1 national monument, and it is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Architecture The arch leading to the forecourt Vilhena Palace is a large building which is considered to be \\"an excellent example of French Baroque.\\" It has a U-shaped forecourt surrounded with loggias, which follows the plan of the original castle, and it possibly contains some remnants of the 16th century palace incorporated into the structure. The forecourt is approached through a gate decorated with Vilhena's coat of arms. The central fa√ßade of the palace contains the ornate main doorway, which is flanked by Corinthian columns and is surmounted by a bronze relief of De Vilhena and another coat of arms. The palace's interior is irregularly planned, contrasting sharply with the regularity and balance of the exterior. The building also contains an inner courtyard. Vilhena Palace is linked to the Corte Capitanale, which was built at the same time as the palace and was also designed by Mondion. This building served as Mdina's law courts, and its linking to the palace was a symbolic gesture to convey that the courts were under the jurisdiction of the Order of St. John. The Corte Capitanale now serves as the seat of Mdina's local council.

By the late 1970s, it had become a red light district overrun with adult movie theaters and street prostitution. The adult businesses were zoned out in the late 1980s under an initiative spearheaded by then-downtown councilwoman Susan Hammer. Nightclubs began opening and the district became known as SoFA during that period. In 2011, Arts Place, a consortium of 11 large foundations, granted $500,000 to a SoFA Initiative proposed by the 1stAct nonprofit to turn Parque de los Pobladores into an ‚Äúurban plaza‚Äù and an \\"outdoor living room\\" for SoFA.

He is noted for his work on thermal radiation and on his creation of 4-figure logarithm tables, used to convert long multiplication and division calculations to simpler addition and subtraction before the introduction of fast calculators. Background The grave of James Thomson Bottomley, Western Necropolis, Glasgow He was born in Fort Breda, County Down in Ireland, on 10 January 1845, the son of William Bottomley JP, a merchant in nearby Belfast. His mother, Anna Thomson, was the sister of William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, a connection which served him well throughout his life. He was educated at Queens College, Belfast and then Trinity College, Dublin, originally studying natural philosophy and chemistry. Career His first employment was as assistant to scientist Thomas Andrews in Belfast. He then became a Demonstrator at King's College London, first in chemistry and then in physics. In 1870 he became a Demonstrator in Physics at Glasgow University. In 1875 this was retitled the Arnott and Thomson Demonstrator in Experimental Physics, following a bequest from the widow of Neil Arnott. In 1872 his uncle Lord Kelvin proposed him as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and this was duly accepted. In June 1888 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in London. On 5 February 1896 Bottomley was involved in the first demonstration of x-rays in Scotland. His uncle, Lord Kelvin, had received papers from Rontgen, but being ill passed them to his nephew, Bottomley, to deal with, also passing special equipment needed for the demonstration. Bottomley engaged Dr John Macintyre an electrical expert at Glasgow Royal Infirmary to make the demonstration.http://sshm.ac.uk/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/PROCEEDINGS-SESSION-1994-1995-and-1995-1996.pdf In 1899, again with his uncle, the Glasgow engineering firm of Kelvin, Bottomley & Baird (K.B.B) was formed, specialising in gauges and meters but also producing loudspeakers and telephones. He became its chairman in 1908. In 1913 it became a Limited Company. He lived at 13 University Gardens, Glasgow, in this period.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1911-12 He died in Glasgow on 18 May 1926. His grave stands close to the summit of the Western Necropolis in Glasgow. The company of Kelvin, Bottomley and Baird continued until 1947. Family He married twice: firstly to Annie Elizabeth Heap of Manchester; secondly to Eliza Jennet Blandy, daughter of Charles R Blandy of Madeira. William Thomson, Lord Kelvin and James Thomson were his uncles. Publications * Dynamics: Theoretical Mechanics. 1877 * On radiation from dull and bright surfaces.

Education and experience  Chester (Chet) Sutula obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from Holy Cross College, Worcester, Massachusetts in 1954 and his Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry from Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa in 1959. He worked for eight years for Marathon Oil Company, Littleton, Colorado, performing research on the influence of capillarity and surface chemical forces in secondary oil production, and, the structural properties of microemulsions using small angle x-ray scattering. In 1967, he joined Ames Company, a division of Miles Laboratories, Inc. in Elkhart, Indiana and became its Research Director in 1970. His team at Ames performed fundamental and applied research on the properties of solid, porous analytical devices, such as, Lateral flow device (strip test) for urinalysis, blood chemistry, microbiology and quantitative, simple measurement of blood glucose for daily use by diabetics. In 1976, he joined Ortho Diagnostics Systems, a division of Johnson & Johnson, Inc., as vice president of R&D; and worked on new systems for blood typing, high volume immunoassays, and tests to detect hepatitis, pregnancy and blood coagulation disorders. In 1981, with his wife, Jane, and a technology partner in Europe, Dr. Sutula founded Agdia, Inc., Elkhart, Indiana, to develop and provide reliable and practical diagnostics for the detection of plant pathogens. Dr. Sutula has served on American Phytopathological Society (APS) committees for Industry, for Virology, and for Diagnostics and has been a reviewer for Plant Disease. He has authored several articles and many posters and presentations dealing with the detection of plant pathogens.  Realization/ Works  1/ In the 80's, diagnostic assays based on the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method were already being developed for human and veterinary applications. Following the reports of the first use of ELISA to detect plant viruses by Voller and Clarke (1976), Dr. Sutula introduced in 1981 the first commercial kits for the detection of common viruses and bacteria in potato. These kits provided all of the components that were necessary to perform the test in a ready-to-use format, called PathoScreen¬Æ. He established collaborations with many plant pathologists all over the world to produce tests that are recognized worldwide for their quality and value. 2/ With two competing companies in Europe, Inotech, Basil, Switzerland and Boehringer Mannheim, Germany, Dr. Sutula pioneered the concept of \\"reagent sets\\"‚Äîmatched, quality-controlled antibodies and antibody-enzyme conjugates that can be used to prepare and perform one's own test. He integrated these ideas into plant diagnostics, expanded the scope of diagnostic assays, and guided Agdia to a continuous company growth over the past 35 years. 3/ In response to many requests, he formed Agdia Testing Services in 1982, a unit of Agdia. Agdia currently offers more than 200 tests that use several technologies, such as ELISA, Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), nucleic acid hybridization, immunochromatography, and Immunofluorescence assay (IFA), to detect viruses, viroids, bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, insects, plant hormones, and proteins in conventional and genetically modified crops (GMO). He developed international sales and helped to establish Agdia-Biofords, French company based in Genopole √âvry, in charge of product distribution in Europe, Africa and Middle East. Dr. Sutula's vision was to make research on detecting plant pathogens available to many persons in worldwide agriculture and to package this technology into easy-to-perform, affordable tests. Now in retirement, Chet continues his special interest in simplifying complex chemistry and procedures into tests that are reliable and simple to perform.

History P W Wills was started by husband and wife, Percy and Helen Wills in 1922. Percy had worked in the shoe trade building up contacts, and as he knew his wife had taste in fashions and decided to open a small ladies fashions store in Park Road, Rushden. The business use to hold fashion shows to show off the wears, with the 1948 show being held at the Windmill Hall and attracting over 2000 people. The business was successful, so the business moved to new premises on the corner of Newton Road and the High Street in Rushden. The new store allowed the company to increase their product range. The business continued to grow adding further stores in Wellingborough (1936) and Kettering (1938). Between 1961 and 1962 the business renovated the store with new shop fronts and interiors, and in 1969 the company joined the Associated Independent Store group, the largest buying group in the country at that time. The building was further remodelled in 1974, which doubled the shop floor space in Newton Road. During the 1980s, a hardware department was added to the store plus a car park was created in Newton Road. Further refurbishment of the store occurred in 1985/86 on the first floor, with the ground floor receiving a refurbishment in 1987. However, in 1986, the Kettering store was closed. During the 1990s the store was extended by purchasing the lease on the neighbouring George Allan property, turning this new area into an exclusive Wills for Men department. In 1999 the shoe department was relaunched in new premises, that had formerly housed Horsley's Pet Shop. However the financial collapse of the late 00s and the fall off in sales saw the business be put into liquidation and closed in September 2010.
