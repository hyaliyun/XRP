The story of her life as it has been preserved is a mixture of fact and fiction. She is venerated as one of nine sisters, including Quiteria and Liberata (Santa Librada). Legend She is said to have been born in Bracara (today Braga, Portugal) to Lucius Catilius Severus, Roman governor of Gallaecia and Lusitania, and Calcia, his wife. Marina was one of nine daughters. Calcia, frightened that her husband would interpret this multiple birth as a sign of infidelity, ordered her servant Sila to drown the girls in the Mi√±or River. Disobeying her mistress, Sila, secretly a Christian, left Calcia's daughters in the care of several families. Marina and her sisters were baptized by the Bishop of Braga Saint Ovidius (Ovid, Ovidio) and brought up in the Christian faith. When they were twenty, they were accused of being Christians and brought before their father the governor. He recognized them as his own daughters, and asked them to renounce their faith, promising them luxuries. St. Quiteria is one of her sisters who also venerated as a saint. The sisters refused and were imprisoned. They managed to escape and were ultimately martyred for their faith. A spring of water gushed out of the spot where they were beheaded; the spot was called Aguas Santas (\\"Holy Waters\\"). Veneration Marina's legend is similar to another Portuguese saint, the virgin martyr St. Quiteria and it is also believed that St. Quiteria is her sister. Her legend was sometimes also confused with that of Margaret of Antioch, who was sometimes also called Marina. Due to a confusion with the popular figure of Wilgefortis, Liberata is sometimes represented as martyred on a cross. The saint is no longer included in the Roman Martyrology, but previous versions ‚ÄîBaronius introduced her in the second edition‚Äîdescribe her as: .‚ÄòSanta Marina di Orense Martire ‚Äô, Santi e Beati. The spread of her cult is attested by the fact that many churches were dedicated to her not only in Galicia and Astorga, but also at C√≥rdoba and Seville. The friar and historian Juan Mu√±oz de la Cueva was an ardent protector of the cult of Marina of Aguas Santas.Jos√© Mar√≠a Castroviejo, Galicia: Gu√≠a Espiritual de una Tierra (Madrid: Espasa-Calpe, 1960), 340. Popular devotion traditionally places the date of death for Mari√±a and Liberata (one of her sisters) on January 18, 139. The feast of Marina is celebrated on July 18. Liberata's feast day is celebrated on July 20, which is the date for the translation of her relics from the city of Sig√ºenza to Baiona in 1515. Liberata (in Portuguese Livrada) is the patron saint of Sig√ºenza. The chapel dedicated to her in the transept of the city's cathedral, with a splendid reredos and the relics of the saint, was constructed at the expense of Bishop Fadrique de Portugal.Ram√≥n Ruiz Amad√≥ and Teodoro Rodr√≠guez y Fern√°ndez, ‚ÄòSig√ºenza‚Äô, in The Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 13 (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912).

She is a former lover and colleague of Reed Richards. Alyssa works as a scientist, and has a genius-level intellect nearly equal to that of Reed. She first appeared in Fantastic Four vol. 3 #5 (May 1998). Fictional character biography Alyssa Moy has been a seldom used character since her creation and has been associated almost exclusively with the Fantastic Four. In one instance, for example, she lends her hovercar to assist Reed and Ben Grimm in retrieving an essential item a villain has tossed miles away. In another instance, Alyssa and Franklin Richards face down the extra-dimensional threat of the Warwolves, who pursue them through the New York City. The wolves take on the shape of civilians to try to entrap them. Alyssa witnesses the wolves killing at least one police officer, a sight she tries to shield Franklin from. Alyssa and Franklin are soon rescued from the wolves by the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four vol. 3 # 7; July 1998; Chris Claremont (plot), Salvador Larroca (pencils), Art Thibert (inks), Comicraft (letters), Liquid!

Everyone is transported to the Otherworld, to face the entire Captain Britain Corps, which is controlled by Roma. The entire incident had started because Roma believed Franklin to be a threat to the multiverse. He uses these powers to save everyone and the Human Torch convinces Roma Franklin is better off with his family. Alyssa helps uncover the mental manipulation done to Reed. Her first clue is when he fails to perform as expected during one of their long-running mental chess games. Alyssa also helps rescue the alternate-version Alysande Stuart from her extra-dimensional captors. Alyssa later returns to solicit Reed's help with 'Nu-World', an man-made planet designed to take refugees from what is seemingly our doomed Earth. Fantastic Four #555 (May 2008) Relationship with Reed Richards At some time in the far past, Reed Richards had proposed to Moy, Moy turning him down with the claim that they had a 'duty' to spread their genius-level genes as widely as possible rather than 'confine' themselves to each other. Reed did not tell Susan this until some time after Moy had re-entered his life. According to the current Fantastic Four writer, Mark Millar, Moy will again play a role in the comic as he explores her relationship with Reed Richards much more in depth. Millar said: \\"It just always struck me that Reed would have had someone prior to Sue, since he's ten years older than she is. Also, Sue's so different from Reed and I felt the girl out there would be much more like he was, a female Reed Richards of sorts, and someone he'd have met at university. As luck would have it, Chris Claremont created exactly such a character and her name is Alyssa Moy. Her nickname in our story is Mrs. Fantastic and you'll see why when you read the first issue.\\"Interview with Mark Millar in Uncanny X-Men # 495. Brubaker, Choi, Oback. During a reunion, Alyssa suggested to Reed that both of them had married the wrong people on the grounds that neither of their spouses could fully understand their work, but Reed informed Alyssa that he married Sue because he loved her.Fantastic Four #557 (July, 2008) The Alyssa of eight years in the future of 'Nu-World' is now a floating brain in a robotic body still married to Ted Castle, helping to keep the planet from being destroyed.

It also organizes archeological digs in Lithuania. History The Museum of Antiquities in Vilnius, founded by Eustachy Tyszkiewicz in 1855, was the forerunner of today's museum. At its inception, the museum focused on the culture and history of the Lithuanian Grand Duchy. Made up mostly of Polish private collections, it was quite popular and received many visitors. After the January Uprising of 1863, the Russian Empire moved much of the collection to Moscow; the remaining collections were re-organized and were incorporated into the Vilnius Public Library. From 1866 to 1914, the museum and the library operated together. In 1915, when the Eastern Front of World War I approached Vilnius, more of the exhibits was taken to Russia. After Lithuanian independence was established in 1918, the Museum of History and Ethnography was founded, based on the collections in the Museum of Antiquities and the Lithuanian Scientific Society. Its director was Jonas Basanaviƒçius, one of the signatories to the Act of Independence of Lithuania. After 1919, Vilnius became a part of Poland, and the organization was incorporated into Vilnius University. In 1941, the Academy of Sciences acquired the collections of all the museums in Vilnius. The museum again became a separate entity in 1952 under the direction of the historian Vincas ≈Ωilƒónas. In 1967, the museum established itself at the Vilnius Castle Complex's New Arsenal. The museum hosted a major exposition in 1968. During the 1970s and 1980s historic materials from across the country were gathered. In 1992, after Lithuania re-established its independence, it was renamed the National Museum of Lithuania. It is now part of the Ministry of Culture. Organization The House of the Signatories houses a part of the museum's collections The museum has five main departments: History and Latest History, Archaeology, Ethnography, Numismatics, and Iconography, containing a total of 800,000 items. The collections are housed at: * New Arsenal at the Vilnius Castle Complex * Old Arsenal at the Vilnius Castle Complex * Gediminas Tower in Vilnius * Bastion of Vilnius Defensive Wall * Kazys Varnelis House- Museum * House of the Signatories in Vilnius * Vincas Kudirka Museum in the ≈†akiai district * Jonas Basanaviƒçius Birthplace in the Vilkavi≈°kis district * Memorial Homestead of Jonas ≈†li≈´pas in Palanga Additional departments belonging to the institution are the Department of Information and Education, the Department for Displays Registration and Preservation, the D√©partement for Restoration and the Department of Publishing.

Harcourt Brace & Company (1919) Alfred Harcourt and Donald Brace were friends at Columbia University in New York, and both worked for Henry Holt & Company before founding their own publishing company in 1919. Harcourt Brace & Company published the works of a number of world-renowned writers, including Sinclair Lewis, Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, James Thurber, George Orwell and Robert Penn Warren. By 1960, Harcourt Brace led the market in high school textbook publishing, but had little presence in the elementary school market. That year, William Jovanovich, who had become president of the company in 1954, took the company public and merged Harcourt Brace & Company with World Book Company to create Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc. This was a strategic move that had a long-term impact on the company because World Book was an established elementary textbook publisher and a test publisher. In 1970, the company became known as Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (HBJ), with William Jovanovich as chairman. That same year, the company acquired The Psychological Corporation. Under Jovanovich's leadership, the company diversified into non-publishing businesses such as insurance and business consulting. It also bought several theme parks‚Äîincluding SeaWorld, which it acquired in 1976 for $46 million. The company divested its theme park division in 1989 for $1.1 billion. World Book Company (1905) World Book Company opened its first office in Manila in 1905 and published English- language educational materials for schools in the Philippines. The company later moved to New York City, where it became a test publisher. Much of the company's success was based on the work of Arthur S. Otis, who was best known for the intelligence tests he developed for the U.S. Army. Millions of World War I draftees took Otis‚Äô tests. World Book Company became the first publisher of group-administered tests measuring mental ability when it published Otis‚Äô Group Intelligence Scale in 1918. Otis joined World Book in 1921. By the time World Book merged with Harcourt Brace in 1960, it had a portfolio of educational tests, including the Stanford Achievement Test (1923), the Metropolitan Achievement Test (1932) and the Otis Mental Ability Test (1936). World Book Company was not related to World Book, Inc., the Chicago-based publisher of encyclopedias and other reference books. The Psychological Corporation (1921) Psychologist James McKeen Cattell founded The Psychological Corporation in New York in 1921. Cattell was a leading figure in psychology and was the president of the American Psychological Association, as well as founder and editor of Scientific Monthly and head of Columbia University‚Äôs psychology department. At age 60, when Columbia dismissed him because of his public opposition to the draft in World War I, Cattell decided to pursue his interest in publishing. He joined forces with two former graduate students, Robert Sessions Woodworth and Edward Lee Thorndike. Both were eminent psychologists, and Thorndike was regarded as the foremost authority on the analysis and measurement of learning. The three men started a business to market psychological tests and related materials to educational, corporate and government clients. In 1939, the company published the Wechsler- Bellevue Intelligence Scales. David Wechsler was a former student of Woodworth at Columbia University. In 1970, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich acquired The Psychological Corporation and, in 1976, merged its educational testing department, acquired from World Book Company in 1960, into The Psychological Corporation. In the 1980s and 1990s, The Psychological Corporation (TPC) expanded through a number of acquisitions. In 1986, the company acquired Merrill Publishing's test division with its portfolio of tests for language, speech and hearing. In 1993, it acquired Cognitronics Corporation. In 1994, the company acquired Communication Skill Builders/Therapy Skill Builders and its therapy products for speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists and physical therapists. In 1983, The Psychological Corporation moved from New York to Cleveland. When the company moved to San Antonio, Texas, in 1985, it established its own operational services, including customer service, warehouse, distribution, information technology, scoring and reporting services. In order to establish a stronger identity for its educational assessment products, and to link them more closely to the Harcourt name, The Psychological Corporation's education testing unit was branded as Harcourt Brace Educational Measurement in 1995. The name was shortened in 1999 to Harcourt Educational Measurement. Harcourt General, Harcourt, Inc. and Harcourt Assessment, Inc. In 1991, General Cinema Corporation, a diversified company that operated retailers such as Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, as well as a national chain of movie theaters, acquired Harcourt Brace Jovanovich for more than $1.5 billion. In 1993, General Cinema Corporation renamed itself Harcourt General and restored the publishing division's name to the historic Harcourt Brace & Company. At the end of the year, Harcourt General divested its cinema division. In 1999, Harcourt General divested its retail division and shortened the publishing division's name to Harcourt, Inc. That same year, Harcourt, Inc. adopted the brand name Harcourt Assessment for its testing businesses. At the time, Harcourt Assessment comprised The Psychological Corporation, which was known as the clinical division, and Harcourt Educational Measurement, which was known as the education division. In late 2003, the testing business legally changed its name to Harcourt Assessment, Inc., and unified its two divisions into one operating company. The company retired the two division names ‚Äì Harcourt Educational Measurement and The Psychological Corporation ‚Äì although it retained ‚ÄúPsychCorp‚Äù as a brand imprint for select products. Reed Elsevier Group plc In 2001, the Anglo-Dutch publishing company Reed Elsevier acquired Harcourt General and Harcourt, Inc., including the business then known as Harcourt Assessment, Inc. Harcourt Assessment encountered two straight years with mass layoffs as a result of poor management and a failed strategy to expand into the state assessment market. In January 2006, more than 70 workers were laid off.Harcourt's recent job cuts due to competitive testing market, San Antonio Business Journal, February 10, 2006.

On February 15, 2007, Reed Elsevier announced its intention to sell its education arm, Harcourt Education, of which Harcourt Assessment is a part. According to Reed Chief Executive Crispin Davis, \\"This is essentially a strategic decision that we want to focus more sharply on our three existing businesses ... with better growth rates\\". Pearson Education plc On May 4, 2007, Pearson, the international education and information company, announced that it had agreed to acquire Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier for $950m in cash. The sale of the two units left Reed Elsevier with most of Harcourt Education still to sell, comprising its large U.S. textbook business and a number of supplemental publishing businesses. Pearson already held a market-leading position in the U.S. textbook market and would not be interested in the main Harcourt business on account of regulatory concerns. Reed stated that it expected to complete the sale in the second half of the year and would use the funds raised to return cash to shareholders. On January 30, 2008, Pearson completed the acquisition of Harcourt Assessment, Inc., having obtained all necessary regulatory approvals. Doug Kubach, president of Pearson's Assessment & Information group, led the integration of Harcourt Assessment into Pearson.

It was entered into the 1967 Cannes Film Festival. It was filmed in colour in West Germany in 1967. Plot Marie (Anita Pallenberg) shoots her ex- boyfriend with his own gun, after he attempts to beat her.

Soundtrack The soundtrack by Brian Jones has never had an official release, possibly because of legal conflicts. Jones played on the soundtrack, while Yardbirds guitarist Jimmy Page, session pianist Nicky Hopkins, musician Peter Gosling, and Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones also contributed their respective instruments to the recording sessions which took place between late 1966 and early 1967 at IBC Studios in London. Jones stated that \\"the boys in the band played on the record\\" but Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman has said that neither he nor drummer Charlie Watts participated and Jones never specified exactly which members played on the soundtrack. Jones also claimed that included many session musicians, but according to the session logs most of the instrumentation was done by Jones himself.

Distribution and habitat  The Manx robber fly was first discovered on the Isle of Man in the 1940s, hence the name 'Manx', meaning from the Isle of Man, although this species has been referred to as the Irish robber fly in British Soldierflies and their Allies. It was originally thought to be endemic to the island but has since also been found across the Irish Sea on sand dunes on the east coast of Ireland. There is only one authenticated record from the United Kingdom. Speight also found the fly in Germany in 1987 and has identified flies from museum specimens collected from north Germany, the Netherlands, northern France and Hungary to be M. cowini, not M. cingulatus as formerly believed. It was first discovered in curragh (willow carr/swamp) habitat in the north of Isle of Man and was recorded there again in the mid-1990s, when a pair was caught in a pan trap by Steve Crellin, a local entomologist. Although found in the curragh, this pair were probably associated with a man-made sod hedge. Furthermore, it is believed that a former locality of the species, on road verges and farmland near the old Ballamona Hospital, just outside Douglas, the capital of the Isle of Man, have been unknowingly destroyed by road widening and other ribbon development, as an ecological survey undertaken before the building of the new Nobles Hospital failed to locate any specimens despite extensive trapping and surveying. The robber fly still exists at a number of sites throughout the north of the Isle of Man, including The Ayres National Nature Reserve and Manx Wildlife Trust's reserve at Cronk y Bing, where it is probably associated with dry sandy conditions (possibly its larval habitat) and vegetation such as brambles and gorse which provide perching sites. Speight noted flourishing colonies along the sandy coasts of the north-east Isle of Man in 1987.  Taxonomy  The scientific name of the species, Machimus cowini (Hobby, 1946), comes from the entomologist who discovered the species, W. S. Cowin. The scientific name of the species was once Epitriptus cowini; however, it was renamed Machimus cowini after being placed in the genus Machimus.  Conservation  The conservation status of the species is currently unknown; however, the Manx Wildlife Trust and Manx National Trust, through the creation of nature reserves, have saved the habitat of the robber fly from total destruction.  Miscellaneous  In 1979 the Isle of Man Post Office issued a 13-pence stamp to celebrate 100 years of the Manx Natural History & Antiquarian Society. Painted by J. H. Nicholson, it depicts the Manx robber fly, and gives its former binomial name Epitriptus cowini. On 1 February 2001 the Isle of Man Post Office again issued a stamp depicting the Manx robber fly, in the series named 'Bugs and Bees', with the value of 58 pence.

Cross-country (XC) cycling is a discipline of mountain biking. Cross-country cycling became an Olympic sport in 1996 and is the only form of mountain biking practiced at the Olympics. Mountain Biking in the Olympics Terrain Cross-country cycling is defined by the terrain on which it is performed. XC courses and trails consist of a mix of rough forest paths and singletrack (also referred to as doubletrack depending on width), smooth fireroads, and even paved paths connecting other trails. Until recently cross-country trails were deemed \\"easy\\" or \\"intermediate\\", due to the concept that this discipline of mountain biking relies more on physical prowess than technical ability. Bikes and equipment South African Burry Stander winning on a dual-suspension Specialized. Cross-country bicycles are some of the lightest mountain bikes, typically between . They usually feature suspension forks in front and sometimes have suspension in the rear. In both the front and rear, most XC bicycles have approximately of suspension travel, although some riders prefer of travel as bicycle frame strength and technology advance. The geometry of the frames generally places the rider in a little more upright position than on a road bicycle but much less than on a downhill bike. Bicycle helmets are often used for cross-country riding. However, XC riders only rarely wear full- face helmets and do not wear the full body \\"armour\\" employed by downhill riders. Cross-country cyclists are more prone to injuries than road cyclists; however, the injuries sustained by XC riders are usually not as severe. Racing A cross-country mountain biking race. Cross-country racing emphasizes endurance above technical prowess, and races vary from 30 minutes to 24 hours in length. Additionally, many mountain bike races are divided up into stages so as to span several days. Races can be either point-to-point or lap-based. Short-track cross-country consists of many very short laps so as to be spectator-friendly. Unlike downhill races, which are conducted in a time trial format, cross-country races traditionally feature a mass start or interval start, where riders are released in several large groups divided by age and/or ability. Races with very large fields that do not wish to stagger starts will sometimes employ a Le Mans start where racers begin by running to their bikes. Start line for the under 23 men's cross-country race at the 2009 UCI World Championships. Globally, XC racing is governed by the Union Cycliste Internationale. In the United States, it is under the purview of USACMTB a division of USA Cycling. In the United Kingdom, British Cycling is the governing body. Racing disciplines There are some XC racing disciplines, like XCE ( Cross-Country eliminator ), XCO ( Cross-Country Olympic ) or XCM ( Cross-Country Marathon ). Cross-Country Eliminator (XCE) A race where the last person or the last two people who go through the finish line are out of the race. Cross-Country Olympic (XCO) Consists of a lap racing around a short circuit. It's the only discipline which is in the Olympics, and high mountain bike skills are required. Cross-Country Marathon (XCM) With a route usually between 65 and 100 km. It has gained popularity in the last years, because XCM competition participation is open to everyone, including beginners. Wheel size Course used at the 2009 UCI World Championships in Australia. In cross-country, more than other areas of mountain biking, a debate has begun over the optimal wheel size. The 26-inch wheel size that was settled on with the inception of the current age of mountain biking has all but died off at the top level of cross-country racing as 27.5 inch (650b) and 29 inch wheels are much more popular now. 650b wheels are 584 mm diameter wheels, and approximately 27.5\\" with a mounted tire. 650b bikes are becoming ever more prevalent, while 29\\" bikes, or \\"29ers\\" experienced rapidly gaining popularity in the mid to late 2000s, and having some success in cross-country racing, but more so in marathon cross-country. A notable boost to their popularity came with Lance Armstrong, racing and winning on a Gary Fisher 29er. Advantages to the larger wheel formats are less need for suspension due to a decreased angle of attack, and also less loss of momentum. Disadvantages include increased weight, decreased acceleration, higher rolling inertia, rider fit issues for those under 5'5\\" (165 cm), and slower handling, although handling issues are being addressed successfully in newer designs with geometry changes like steeper head tube angles and higher fork offsets. A further disadvantage is that, all other variables (spoke number, rim design and material, etc.) being equal, a 26\\" wheel will be much stronger than a 29\\" one.

By analogy, the term Misiurewicz point is also used for parameters in a multibrot set where the unique critical point is strictly preperiodic. (This term makes less sense for maps in greater generality that have more than one (free) critical point because some critical points might be periodic and others not.) Principal Misiurewicz point of the wake 1/31 Mathematical notation  A parameter c is a Misiurewicz point M_{k,n} if it satisfies the equations :f_c^{(k)}(z_{cr}) = f_c^{(k+n)}(z_{cr}) and : f_c^{(k-1)}(z_{cr}) eq f_c^{(k+n-1)}(z_{cr}) so : :M_{k,n} = c : f_c^{(k)}(z_{cr}) = f_c^{(k+n)}(z_{cr}) where : * z_{cr} is a critical point of f_c, * k and n are positive integers, * f_c^{k} denotes the k-th iterate of f_c. Name Misiurewicz points are named after the Polish-American mathematician Micha≈Ç Misiurewicz.Micha≈Ç Misiurewicz home page, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Note that the term \\"Misiurewicz point\\" is used ambiguously: Misiurewicz originally investigated maps in which all critical points were non-recurrent (that is, there is a neighborhood of every critical point that is not visited by the orbit of this critical point), and this meaning is firmly established in the context of dynamics of iterated interval maps.Wellington de Melo, Sebastian van Strien, \\"One-dimensional dynamics\\". Monograph, Springer Verlag (1991) The case that for a quadratic polynomial the unique critical point is strictly preperiodic is only a very special case; in this restricted sense (as described above) this term is used in complex dynamics; a more appropriate term would be Misiurewicz‚ÄìThurston points (after William Thurston, who investigated postcritically finite rational maps). Synonyms * hub ( in case of branch point) Quadratic maps A complex quadratic polynomial has only one critical point. By a suitable conjugation any quadratic polynomial can be transformed into a map of the form P_c(z)=z^2+c which has a single critical point at z = 0. The Misiurewicz points of this family of maps are roots of the equations :P_c^{(k)}(0) = P_c^{(k+n)}(0), (subject to the condition that the critical point is not periodic), where : *k is the pre-period *n is the period *P_c^{(n)} = P_c ( P_c^{(n-1)}) denotes the n-fold composition of P_c(z)=z^2+c with itself i.e. the nth iteration of P_c. For example, the Misiurewicz points with k=2 and n=1, denoted by M2,1, are roots of :P_c^{(2)}(0) = P_c^{(3)}(0) :\\\\Rightarrow c^2+c=(c^2+c)^2+c :\\\\Rightarrow c^4+2c^3=0. The root c=0 is not a Misiurewicz point because the critical point is a fixed point when c=0, and so is periodic rather than pre-periodic. This leaves a single Misiurewicz point M2,1 at c = ‚àí2\\\\. Properties of Misiurewicz points of complex quadratic mapping Misiurewicz points belong to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. Misiurewicz points are dense in the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.Adrien Douady, John Hubbard, \\"Etude dynamique des polyn√¥mes complexes\\", pr√©publications math√©matiques d'Orsay, 1982/1984Dierk Schleicher, \\"On Fibers and Local Connectivity of Mandelbrot and Multibrot Sets\\", in: M.

Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics 72, American Mathematical Society (2004), 477‚Äì507 or online paper from arXiv.org If c is a Misiurewicz point, then the associated filled Julia set is equal to the Julia set, and means the filled Julia set has no interior. If c is a Misiurewicz point, then in the corresponding Julia set all periodic cycles are repelling (in particular the cycle that the critical orbit falls onto). The Mandelbrot set and Julia set J_c are locally asymptotically self-similar around Misiurewicz points.Lei.pdf Tan Lei, \\"Similarity between the Mandelbrot set and Julia Sets\\", Communications in Mathematical Physics 134 (1990), pp. 587-617. =Types= Misiurewicz points can be classified according to number of external rays that land on them :, points where branches meet * branch points ( = points that disconnect the Mandelbrot set into at least three components.) with 3 or more external arguments ( angles ) * non-branch points with exactly 2 external arguments ( = interior points of arcs within the Mandelbrot set) : these points are less conspicuous and thus not so easily to find on pictures. * end points with 1 external argument ( branch tips ) According to the Branch Theorem of the Mandelbrot set, all branch points of the Mandelbrot set are Misiurewicz points (plus, in a combinatorial sense, hyperbolic components represented by their centers). Many (actually, most) Misiurewicz parameters in the Mandelbrot set look like \`centers of spirals'.The boundary of the Mandelbrot set by Michael Frame, Benoit Mandelbrot, and Nial Neger The explanation for this is the following: at a Misiurewicz parameter, the critical value jumps onto a repelling periodic cycle after finitely many iterations; at each point on the cycle, the Julia set is asymptotically self- similar by a complex multiplication by the derivative of this cycle. If the derivative is non-real, then this implies that the Julia set, near the periodic cycle, has a spiral structure. A similar spiral structure thus occurs in the Julia set near the critical value and, by Tan Lei's aforementioned theorem, also in the Mandelbrot set near any Misiurewicz parameter for which the repelling orbit has non-real multiplier. Depending on the value of the multiplier, the spiral shape can seem more or less pronounced. The number of the arms at the spiral equals the number of branches at the Misiurewicz parameter, and this equals the number of branches at the critical value in the Julia set. (Even the \`principal Misiurewicz point in the 1/3-limb', at the end of the parameter rays at angles 9/56, 11/56, and 15/56, turns out to be asymptotically a spiral, with infinitely many turns, even though this is hard to see without magnification.) =External arguments= External arguments of Misiurewicz points, measured in turns are : where: a and b are positive integers and b is odd, subscript number shows base of numeral system.

The term slot is common for this purpose in very long instruction word (VLIW) computers, where the relationship between operation in an instruction and pipeline to execute it is explicit. In dynamically scheduled machines, the concept is more commonly called an execute pipeline. Modern conventional central processing units (CPU) have several compute pipelines, for example: two arithmetic logic units (ALU), one floating point unit (FPU), one Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) (such as MMX), one branch. Each of them can issue one instruction per basic instruction cycle, but can have several instructions in process. These are what correspond to slots. The pipelines may have several FUs, such as an adder and a multiplier, but only one FU in a pipeline can be issued to in a given cycle.

He can switch between all perimeter positions (shooting guard, small forward and point guard). He was part of the Italian national team that won a silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Professional career The Mantuan played youth basketball with local clubs Vigor and Pallacanestro Mantovana before moving to third division Serie B side Juvi Cremona in 1993 to start his professional career. After three years with Cremona Soragna discovered the first division Serie A with Rolly Pistoia in 1996. He then moved to Basket Barcellona of the fourth division Serie B2, helping the Sicilians earn promotions to the Serie B1 in 1998, then the Serie A2 in 1999 before losing in the promotion playoffs final in 2000. Moving to Pallacanestro Biella in 2000, he was this time part of a successful promotion run as the side moved up to the Serie A at the end of the season. The 2001-02 season saw him become Biella's captain. In his fourth season with the side he posted 11.1 points (with 39.1% shooting accuracy from three), 2.9 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 2.3 steals in nearly 33 minutes per game. As he was leaving the club in 2004, Biella retired his number 7 shirt in recognition of his contributions to the club. Soragna moved to Benetton Treviso for 2004-05, making his European top-tier Euroleague debut and winning the Italian Cup that same season. He was named club captain the next season following the departure of Denis Marconato, leading Treviso to the 2006 Serie A title. He also won the 2006 Supercup and 2007 Cup in his five years with the side. Soragna returned to Biella in July 2009, signing a three-year deal with the side about to make its European second-tier Eurocup debut. After becoming the all-time best scorer and the player with the most appearances for Biella in 2010-11, Soragna extended his contract for three seasons in July 2011. The 2012-13 season was less uplifting as he injured himself early in the season, missing a good part of it as Biella were relegated after twelves years in the top-flight. He would return to the Serie A2 with a different club, signing with Upea Capo d'Orlando in August 2013. Again serving as captain, Soragna averaged 7.3 points (42.2% shooting from three), 3 rebounds and 2 assists in 29 regular season games and 9.5 points (51% from three), 3 rebounds and 2.5 assists in the playoffs, he had an important part in the team's promotion, including playing in the final whilst injured. In August 2014, he extended his contract for the following season, one that saw him return to Serie A. On 3 August 2015, he moved to Serie B side Bakery Piacenza, signing a one-year deal. On 26 October 2017, he announced his retirement from professional basketball. International career Soragna played for the Under-22 Italy squad at the 1996 European Championship. He made his debut for the senior Italian national team on 25 November 2001 in a FIBA EuroBasket 2003 qualification game against the Czech Republic. At the EuroBasket 2003 final phase he averaged 6.5 points, 1.3 assists and 1 steal in nearly 21 minutes per game, Italy upset Germany, Greece and France, the latter in a third place game that gave them a bronze medal and a place in the 2004 Summer Olympics, Soragna played 31 minutes in that game, for 5 points, 3 rebounds, 1 assist and 2 steals. Again part of the Italian team at the Athens Olympics the next summer, he averaged 5.2 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.1. assists in nearly 24 minutes per game. He scored 12 points to help Italy get past European champions Lithuania in the semifinal, which already assured the Italians an olympic medal. Soragna also contributed 12 points in the final against Argentina but that was not enough to earn the win, with the Italians going home with a silver medal. At EuroBasket 2005, Soragna had 5 points and 2.3 assists in nearly 20 minutes per game as Italy finished joint-ninth. Soragna was one of the veterans kept in the squad for the 2006 FIBA World Championship after Italy - receiving a wildcard invitation - sent a younger squad. He posted averages of 10,3 points, 1.8 rebounds and 2.7 assists in about 24 minutes, that included 15 points in the third group stage win against Senegal that took Italy to the Last 16, where they lost. Called up for EuroBasket 2007, he had averages of 6.5 points, 1.7 assists and 1.3 steals over around 24 minutes, he was held scoreless in 22 minutes (for 1 assist, steal and turnover each and 2 fouls) as Italy lost to Germany in the Second Round to exit the tournament. He was Italy's captain during FIBA EuroBasket 2009 qualification, but could not help them reach the tournament proper, this proved to be his last participation with the national team.

Plot Colonel Nathan B. \\"Skipper\\" Gregory (Edward Hearn), a former World War I ace pilot, is the owner of a travelling carnival, that has fallen on hard times. Only the money brought in by Craig McCoy (John Wayne), the carnival stunt pilot, keeps the carnival from closing. Jean Gregory (Dorothy Gulliver), Colonel Gregory's daughter, works with Craig as a wing walker and parachutist. A mysterious pilot, the legendary \\"Eagle\\", thought to have been shot down by accident by his own squadron and killed in the war, attempts to sabotage the Evans Aero Co., a large corporation, sending threatening messages to the company's five directors via skywriting, the date that the \\"Eagle\\" was shot down: May 23, 1918. Gregory is thought to be the Eagle because he has a grudge against the company who stole plans for a radio- piloted aircraft. Suspicions also fall on Craig McCoy (John Wayne), the carnival stunt pilot, who is also skilled in skywriting and had left the message about the \\"Eagle\\" after being paid by an anonymous source. Craig goes looking for the \\"Eagle\\", with a new suspect, Mr. Green (Lloyd Whitlock), a director of the corporation and a pilot who flew in the same squadron as the \\"Eagle\\", the likely culprit who stole plans to Gregory's invention. When confronted, Green escapes and teams up with two compatriots, Tim Moore {Bud Osborne} and Boyle (Yakima Canutt) but Craig grabs the plans and rushes back to the carnival to show Jean. Gregory, who is confined to a wheelchair tries to hide from the authorities. Someone steels Craig's aircraft and tries to burn down the carnival. Hoping to prove her father's innocence, the pair then learn of Gregory's disappearance, captured by the henchmen of the \\"Eagle\\". A murder occurs at the corporation and Gregory is again implicated. Jean still thinks that her father is innocent and with Craig, escapes death on many occasions, fighting with gang members, as they go after the real \\"Eagle\\".

Title card Production During the 1930s, after starring in The Big Trail (1930), its subsequent commercial failure meant that Wayne was relegated to minor roles in A-pictures, or starring, with his name over the title, in many low-budget Poverty Row Westerns, mostly at Monogram Pictures and serials for Mascot Pictures Corporation, such as The Shadow of the Eagle.

Erhard Etzlaub (born ca. 1455[?]-1465 in Erfurt; died 1532 in Nuremberg), was an astronomer, geodesist, cartographer, instrument maker and physician. Life One \\"Erhart Etzlauber\\" became a citizen of Nuremberg in 1484, but his profession was not recorded on that occasion. Assuming that the \\"Eberhardus Eczleiben\\" who matriculated at the Erfurter Hochschule in 1468 is very probably the same person, then the year of his birth should be between 1455-1460 rather than later. From letters from a third party dated 1500 and 1507, we learn that he was a well-known instrument (\\"compass\\") maker and a geodesist, and from a letter dated 1517, that \\"he had also practicised as a physician for at least four years\\" and that he \\"comes from Erfurt\\". In 1515, he declared himself to be an \\"astronomer and physician, from Erfurt University\\". His death is officially quoted as the 15th entry in an official list of 20 people buried between December 20, 1531 and February 21, 1532. Therefore, he very probably died in January or early February 1532. There were no inheritors. The cartographer=The \\"Romweg\\" Map On the occasion of the Holy Year 1500, when many pilgrims were expected to go to Rome, he designed his famous \\"Rom-Weg\\" map (= the Way to Rome), a 41 x 29 cm wood engraving in stereographic projection to a scale of about 1:5,600,000. This is the earliest printed road map of central Europe. It is, as all of Etzlaub's maps, \\"south up\\". Distances between cities can be computed by dotted lines, where a one-dot-step means one German Mile (7400m). Coloured prints (according to author's innovative requirements) show political regions, too. The area of the map is between latitudes 58¬∞ (Viborg, Denmark) and 41¬∞ (Naples). No longitudes are given, but Paris shows up at the western margin, and Budapest at the eastern one. Data may have been drawn from c.1421 Klosterneuburg Fridericus map as well as from Etzlaub's own interviews with travelling merchants. The \\"Roman Empire\\" road map This was a second and improved edition of principally the same map, 1501, 54.5 x 39.7 cm, printed in Nuremberg by Georg Glogkendon. In 1533, Glogkendon's son Albrecht printed one more (unchanged) edition. The area covered by that later map was expanded to latitude 40¬∞ (south of Salerno), and about 74 more km towards west, and the map was more detailed in former marginal regions. From all three editions, only 6 samples are known to have survived (e.g. the ones held by SUB (G√∂ttingen), Germanisches Nationalmuseum (Nuremberg), Biblioth√®que Nationale (Paris), British Library (London)), but Etzlaub's data were widely used during the first half of the 16th century, among others by Martin Waldseem√ºller and Sebastian Munster. Often, even the \\"south up\\" display was copied. More maps Miniature map (93 x 65 mm) on the outside of 1511-sundial's hinged lid. This one and a similar one from 1513 were by error called precursors of Mercator's projection since 1917. Besides the innovative \\"Romweg\\" map and its later editions, only two still existing maps are definitely known to be designed by Etzlaub: #A 1492 wood-cut (39 x 27 cm, printed by Jorg [George] Glogkendon, Nuremberg), showing 100 localities and their names within a radius of 120 km from Nuremberg. #Another map of Nuremberg's territory, 1519, painted on parchment by Nuremberg painter Michel Graf (scale ca. 1:30.000, 94 x 84 cm). *An earlier similar map, from 1516, came to us only as a copy made in 1600. *A 1507 plan of Hauseck real estates bought by the Nuremberg magistrate is lost. *With some probability (being very similar to the 1519 map), a map from 1516, parchment, 60 x 69 cm is Etzlaub's design. *The earliest map of Bohemia, created by Mikul√°≈° Klaudy√°n (Nikolaus Klaudian or Claudianus) and printed in Nuremberg in 1518, is likely to be somehow \\"connected\\" to Etzlaub: Klaudy√°n stayed at Nuremberg several times during the years before, and one of Etzlaub's Almanachs appeared in Czech language in 1517 although Etzlaub is very unlikely to have spoken it. The Klaudy√°n map is \\"South-up\\", shows an outline of Bohemia's borders similar to the \\"Romweg\\" map, and is coloured in a similar way. The instrument maker Etzlaub's 1513 sundial, 84 x 116 mm. \\"Kompast\\" [sic!] was the term used for pocket-size sundials produced in Nuremberg since Regiomontanus' days, which were fitted with a compass, too, and were also used by seafarers. Only two of Etzlaub's pieces remain: one, from 1511, is kept by Germanisches Nationalmuseum (Nuremberg), another one, from 1513 and in Drecker's collection, purportedly \\"went to the USA\\". In his time, Etzlaub's pieces were demanded: In a 1507 letter, Michel Beheim, brother of famous globe maker Martin Behaim, tells his brother Wolfgang that such pieces (i.e. more than one) will be sent to him to Lisbon within a few weeks, as soon as Etzlaub would have finished them. Johannes Cochlaeus notes on Etzlaub's work in Brevis Germaniae Descriptio, 1512, that his sundials were even demanded in Rome. Miniature maps (latitudes 67¬∞‚Äì0¬∞, \\"South-up\\", no longitudes given) are engraved on the outside of the instrument's lids, allowing its user to adjust the gnomone according to actual latitude. To cope with compass bearings between the cities given, varying latitudes were used, reducing scale for lower latitudes, which was innovative, but conceptually opposite to Mercator's later approach (F.W. Kr√ºcken, 2004). In 1917, Joseph Drecker (1853‚Äì1931) had examined the 1513 miniature map and declared it to be a Mercator projection. After carefully analyzing both Etzlaub's und Mercator's maps, Kr√ºcken finds out: \\"There is no reason to see Etzlaub as a precursor of Mercator's projection\\". Instructions on the use of his sundials were given by Etzlaub in Codex ad Compastum Norembergensem which was kept by Staatsbibliothek, Munich, Germany, but seems lost. Etzlaub's \\"almanachs\\" Etzlaub's coat of arms. Those were calendars to be hanged on the wall, giving festive days, new and full moon, some planet's positions and hints on healthcare like best times for blood-letting. They show up since 1515. It is likely that Etzlaub published them every year, although the preserved samples are not continuous. According to different regions where they would be sold, the same content was presented in a varying design. From 1520, four different versions exist, designed for \\"Hochstift Eichst√§dt\\", \\"City of Regensburg\\", \\"Pfalzbayern\\" and Austria. Since 1517, Etzlaub's coat of arms shows up in many but not all of his almanacs. It seems, however, to be unknown to relevant German collections of heraldry.

It was created by former President Ibrahim Babangida via a democracy project meant to form two detribalized political parties - one slightly to the left and one to the right. During the Nigerian Third Republic it was seen as a moderate party attractive to young radical intellectuals and socialists. In its manifesto, it called for concerted efforts to improve welfare and fight for social justice. Structure After 13 prospective parties were banned by the administration of Ibrahim Babangida in 1989, some of the associations decided to re-align. The People's Front of Nigeria, People's Solidarity Party, and the Nigerian Labor Party emerged to form the core constituency of the new SDP. The leadership was mostly dominated by Northern Nigerians. Babagana Kingibe was elected party chairman in 1990 over his rival Mohammed Arzika. Despite the dominance of Northern Nigerians, the party's strength lay in the Yoruba people in the states of Imo and Anambra. The party won 57% of Senate seats and 53% of House of Representatives seats in the 1992 National Assembly election. The party was primarily financed by the Federal Government and a individuals such as Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, Francis Nzeribe and M.K.O. Abiola.

On 1 April 2007, Shotgate became the first area of Wickford to have a Parish Council. History Mid-Iron Age pottery found at Shotgate Farm shows that the area was inhabited in 300 BC. In Roman times, a road ran from Ilford to Latchingdon through here. In the Saxon period commonhold land was often sliced into parallel strips known as 'Sceats'. This is the origin of the 'Shot' part of Shotgate, which has nothing to do with shooting or hunting. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists four farmsteads in Wickford, one of which was probably on the site of Shotgate. By 1300 this is listed as Ames or Aimes Farm. By 1540 the Rede family owned the farm, and one of its members, Elizabeth, emigrated to America to marry the son of the governor of Massachusetts, and is an ancestor of both former US president George W. Bush and presidential contender John Kerry. In 1663, Turnpike (Toll) roads appeared in England, and one ran from Shenfield to Rayleigh until 1866 along the Old Southend Road, after which it was turned over to the Rochford Highway Board. During this period (1747), the Sharpe family renamed the Ames Farm as Shotgate Farm. Perhaps this indicated the existence of a tollgate at the Wickford / Rawreth boundary. During this period an inn, the King's Head, stood near present-day Oak Avenue. In 1907, houses were built as part of the \`Plotlands' initiative in Enfield Road and Oak Avenue. In 1921, the Archer family bought Shot Farm, and in 1927 sold land for development. This led to the foundation of modern-day Shotgate, consisting of Bruce Grove, 1st to 5th avenues and the shopping parades. In 1989, the village was greatly expanded by the Hodgsons Way Industrial Estate and housing estates, so named after the WW2 RAF Pilot Officer William Henry Hodgson, who was shot down but managed to ditch his Hurricane aircraft, avoiding the houses of the Shotgate estate. Shotgate sign The sign is located next to the Southend Road (A129), it is made up of various symbols; Gate, Wheatsheaf, Archer, River, Hurricane. *The gate is the way into and out of a SHOT of land. *The wheatsheaf derives from the Wickford coat of arms. *The archer represents the fact that land previously owned by the Archer family, sold in 1927, became known as the Shotgate Estate. *The River Crouch was once much wider and deeper than today and its salt marshes covered what is now Shotgate. *The Hurricane fighter recalls the incident on 31 May 1940, when RAF Pilot Officer William Henry Hodgson, a New Zealander, engaged hostile bombers and fighters over the River Thames in his Hawker Hurricane, but it was hit and caught fire. In attempting to return to his base at RAF Debden, he resisted bailing out, which would have left the aircraft to crash on a populated area and instead, crash landed in fields just outside Shotgate to avoid damage and injury to local people. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.Shotgate Parish Council - News  Community Hall  Before the idea for a community hall had been conceived, many different groups were meeting on a regular basis in Shotgate. These included: * Allotment Holders and Gardeners Association; This was formed in response to governments Dig for Victory appeal in 1942. * Shotgate No. 1 Branch O.A.P. Club; Meetings were held at the Merly Club in Southend Road, which was located opposite where Fred's (F.H. Ives) Timber Yard now stands. * Women's Institute; Meetings were held in the Baptist Church Hall. From this, the ‚ÄòYoung Wives Group‚Äô was formed ( which is now the ‚ÄòShotgate Wives‚Äô). Amongst the groups it was decided that a communal building would be needed for the village. A committee was formed and started to raise funds. This included a weekly collection of 6d (2¬Ωp) from each household, as well as from fetes and waste paper collections. A plot of land in Bruce Grove was to be auctioned in 1952 and a request was made to the Urban District Council to reserve it for the committees. The land was purchased for ¬£325.00 in 1955. A building sub- committee was formed to facilitate the building works. The hall was opened, free of debt, on Saturday 8 November 1958 by councillor Tanswell, the then Chairman of Basildon Council. Some of the materials used in the construction of the building were reclaimed such as the wooden wall panelling which was from a public house in the East End of London and the flooring was from American pre-fabricated buildings. The doors came from Fred's Scrap Yard (now known as Fred's (F.H. Ives) Timber Yard). The committee raised ¬£1200, and with further grants from the Ministry of Education (United Kingdom) for ¬£1218 a grand total of ¬£2418 was reached. The hall would have cost more than this to construct had it not have been for the free labour given by local volunteers. The hall has been extended and refurbished several times since being built originally with the most recent being in 2007 when a disabled toilet was added. The hall is, to this day, still free from debt. It is run by the Shotgate Community Association and funded by the monies raised from hiring out the hall, membership fees and donations. It is not subsidised by the council or any other organisation.Shotgate Community Association Nature reserves There are two adjoining nature reserves. Shotgate ThicketsEssex Wildlife Trust form the northern part of this reserve, which is owned by the Essex Wildlife Trust. The southern part of the reserve is owned by Basildon Borough Council and is named Giddings Copse, in memory of the co-founder and ex-Chairman of the Wickford Wildlife Society - Phil Giddings. The reserve is situated on both sides of the tidal River Crouch which is narrow at this point. It consists of a remnant of old oak woodland on the south side, and thorn thickets, rough grassland and large ponds on the north side. With the adjoining river banks and railway embankment this small area has a surprising diversity of habitats and, consequently, of wildlife.

In Maryland, the federal highway runs from the West Virginia state line at the Potomac River in Williamsport north to the Pennsylvania state line near Maugansville. US 11 is the primary north-south surface highway in central Washington County, connecting Hagerstown with Williamsport to the south and Hagerstown Regional Airport to the north. The federal highway was once a major long-distance highway, but that role has been assumed by Interstate 81 (I-81), which parallels US 11 not only in Maryland but for most of its course from Tennessee to Upstate New York. US 11 is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration except for the municipally-maintained portions within the corporate limits of Williamsport and Hagerstown. US 11 is the descendant of a trail blazed through the Great Appalachian Valley in the 18th century. In the 19th century, this trail was upgraded to a pair of turnpikes, one from Williamsport to Hagerstown and the second from Hagerstown to the Pennsylvania state line. The highway was constructed in its modern form in the early 20th century, with the bridge across the Potomac River constructed in 1909 and the old turnpikes paved as all-weather roads by the nascent Maryland State Roads Commission in the 1910s. These highways and the streets of Hagerstown and Williamsport were designated Maryland's portion of US 11 in 1926. The federal highway was improved outside of the towns in the years surrounding 1930 and again around 1950. Since the completion of I-81 in two sections in the late 1950s and mid-1960s removed long-distance traffic from the highway, US 11 has seen its two major relocations: one that removed the highway from downtown Hagerstown and another required by expansion at Hagerstown Regional Airport. Route description US 11 northbound entering Williamsport US 11 begins at the West Virginia state line on the south bank of the Potomac River. The highway crosses the Potomac River on a two-lane bridge just south of its confluence with Conococheague Creek. The bridge passes over Potomac Park and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. At the east end of the bridge, US 11 enters the town of Williamsport, where the highway is a municipally-maintained two-lane undivided road. The federal highway makes a turn to the north, then makes a sharp turn to the east onto Potomac Street adjacent to the Williamsport Visitor Center of the historical park. Within the Williamsport Historic District, US 11 intersects MD 68 (Conococheague Street) and MD 63\\\\. MD 63 joins MD 68 in a concurrency on Conococheague Street to the south and US 11 on Potomac Street east to Artizan Street, where MD 63 heads north out of town. US 11 veers northeast and heads through a more suburban area of Williamsport. The federal highway leaves the town of Williamsport and becomes state-maintained immediately before expanding to a four-lane divided highway for its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-81 (Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway). US 11 continues northeast as Virginia Avenue, a two-lane highway through residential subdivisions. The federal highway passes close to the historic home Tammany and intersects Governor Lane Boulevard, which heads south through an industrial park. US 11 passes under I-70 with no access and enters the suburb of Halfway, where the highway crosses the Winchester and Western Railroad at- grade and at an angle. The federal highway intersects both Massey Boulevard and Halfway Boulevard, which head northwest toward the Valley Mall. US 11 continues into the city of Hagerstown, where the highway becomes municipally- maintained and enters an industrial area. The federal highway crosses Norfolk Southern Railway's Hagerstown District rail line immediately before its intersection with Wilson Boulevard, which heads east. Virginia Avenue, the old alignment of US 11, continues north toward downtown Hagerstown, passing through the South Prospect Street Historic District and passing by Hagerstown City Park, which contains the Hager House and the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts. US 11 turns west onto Burhans Boulevard and immediately crosses over the Norfolk Southern rail line again. The federal highway curves to the north, paralleling the rail line, then crosses over the Winchester and Western rail line as its junction with the Norfork Southern line. US 11 continues north through a residential neighborhood before passing by the Hagerstown Roundhouse Museum and passing under CSX's Lurgan Subdivision just east of its wye with the Norfolk Southern line. At the intersection with Elgin Boulevard and Lanvale Street, US 11 turns east to remain on Burhans Boulevard and starts to parallel the CSX rail line. The federal highway and railroad curve to the north, where the highway intersects US 40 on the opposite side of the tracks from downtown Hagerstown. US 40 consists of a one-way pair, Washington Street eastbound and Franklin Street westbound. Between the two directions of US 40, US 11 passes the historic Western Maryland Railway Station, which is now the headquarters of the Hagerstown Police Department. North of US 40, US 11 intersects Salem Avenue, crosses Norfolk Southern Railway's Lurgan Branch, and curves north away from CSX's Hanover Subdivision, which turns to the east. Burhans Boulevard reaches its northern end at an oblique three-way intersection with Pennsylvania Avenue. US 11 continues north on Pennsylvania Avenue, passing North Hagerstown High School. State maintenance of the federal highway resumes and the highway's name changes to Middleburg Pike at Haven Road just before the highway leaves the city of Hagerstown. US 11 continues north past residential subdivisions in the suburbs of Fountain Head and Orchard Hills. The federal highway passes a Volvo manufacturing plant and intersects Maugans Avenue, which heads west to Maugansville. North of the intersection with Showalter Road, US 11 adjoins the property of Hagerstown Regional Airport. The federal highway curves to the northeast and passes through a tunnel under the airport's east-west runway. The federal highway curves back to the northwest through an industrial area before resuming its northward course to the Pennsylvania state line. US 11 enters Pennsylvania just south of the federal highway's intersection with PA 163 (Mason Dixon Road). History US 11 northbound in Hagerstown US 11 is the descendant of a trail blazed from Pennsylvania following the establishment of Evan Watkins's ferry across the Potomac River at the mouth of Conococheague Creek in 1744. This trail became part of the Great Wagon Road from Philadelphia south through the Great Appalachian Valley to Virginia and North Carolina. In the center of the Hagerstown Valley along the trail, German immigrant Jonathan Hager laid out his namesake town in 1762. In the 19th century, the Hagerstown and Middleburg Turnpike was constructed between Hagerstown and Middleburg, a settlement on the Pennsylvania side of the state line. In addition. the Williamsport and Hagerstown Turnpike was constructed between the town that sprung up at the Potomac River crossing and the county seat of Washington County. Starting in 1896, the Hagerstown Railway Company of Washington County operated an interurban between Williamsport and Hagerstown adjacent to the turnpike. The streetcar suburb of Halfway developed along the turnpike and trolley line at the midpoint between the two municipalities. The first portion of modern US 11 to be constructed was the bridge over the Potomac River at Williamsport, which was financed and constructed by Washington County and completed in 1909. The new bridge, which became the only crossing between Cumberland and Washington, D.C. to survive the flood of March 1936, charged tolls from a tollgate at the West Virginia end of the bridge. The Maryland State Roads Commission later purchased the bridge in 1954 and removed the tolls in 1958. Both the Williamsport Pike and Middleburg Pike, their right-of- way now owned by the Maryland State Roads Commission, were paved by 1921. Those highways as well as Potomac Street in the town of Williamsport and the streets connecting the two former turnpikes within the city of Hagerstown-- Virginia Avenue, Jonathan Street, and Pennsylvania Avenue--were designated Maryland's portion of US 11 in 1926. The first upgrades to US 11 occurred when Williamsport Pike and Middleburg Pike were rebuilt and widened in the late 1920s and early 1930s, respectively. Williamsport Pike was rebuilt again in 1948, with the highway widened using the right-of-way of the Williamsport- Hagerstown interurban that had ceased service in 1947. By 1950, US 11 in Hagerstown followed a one-way pair: the northbound direction followed Summit Avenue and Jonathan Street between Virginia Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue and the southbound direction used Prospect Street through the downtown area. The first relief from long-distance traffic came to US 11 when the first section of I-81 was completed from US 40 to the Pennsylvania state line in 1958. Following the completion of I-81 from US 40 south to the Potomac River in 1966, US 11 became a highway mainly for local traffic. US 11's bridge across the Potomac River was rebuilt in 1979. In addition, the highway's name south of Hagerstown was changed from Williamsport Pike to Virginia Avenue around 1995. Despite the construction of I-81, another bypass of downtown Hagerstown, Burhans Boulevard, was constructed in the 1960s. Burhans Boulevard was named for Winslow F. Burhans, the mayor of Hagerstown from 1953 to 1965 who was instrumental in elevating the tracks of the Western Maryland Railway on the west side of downtown Hagerstown to eliminate a series of grade crossings. The boulevard was started in 1960 between Salem Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue. Construction was underway on the section between Virginia Avenue and Elgin Boulevard by 1962. Both sections were completed by 1965. Burhans Boulevard was completed around 1968 from Elgin Boulevard to Washington Street, from which the boulevard continued north paralleling the Western Maryland tracks along what had formerly been Foundry Street. At the southern end of Hagerstown, Burhans Boulevard, Virginia Avenue, and Wilson Boulevard were relocated to eliminate two grade crossings with the Norfolk Southern Railway tracks in 1983. Burhans Boulevard remained a regular municipal street until US 11 was rerouted away from downtown Hagerstown around 1987. The other major relocation of US 11 occurred around Hagerstown Regional Airport. Due to the airport's east-west runway being extended eastward, US 11 was relocated by Washington County in 1964, resulting in a wide curve in what had been a straight highway. The portion of highway between Showalter Road and the Pennsylvania state line was subsequently county-maintained until 1972. Another extension of the east- west runway occurred between 2004 and 2007. For this extension, US 11 was relocated to a tunnel underneath the extended runway along the curved alignment in 2006.

It is native to the coastline of western North America from the Alaskan panhandle to Baja California. This slender, vivid green plant has long, flat blades. It grows in large clumps or beds exposed during low tide and submerged at high tide. It is found attached to rocks in the middle to low intertidal zones. Biology Male and female flowers are borne on different plants and there are many more female plants than males. The flowers are in spikes at the base of the leaves and do not have petals. The pollen is spread by water movement which can occur underwater, but most pollination takes place on the surface of the sea at very low tides. Seedlings cannot establish themselves directly on rocks or colonise bare areas. Instead they germinate among algae, such as red coralline algae, attaching themselves by means of small barbs and intertwining their roots among the algae as they grow. They also send out rhizomes which can colonise new areas. When established, the surf grass may dominate the habitat. A biodiverse invertebrate community lives in surf grass beds and includes snails, limpets and crustaceans, and algae may grow on the stems and leaves. Uses Sea grass was used by Native American tribes along the Southern California Coast to make cordage and other woven objects, including specimens from San Miguel Island dated between about 10,000 and 8,600 years ago (see Connolly, Erlandson, and Norris 1992).

It passed through the former town of Enfield, then northward along the Swift River into Greenwich and the northern end of Dana before heading through the current town of Petersham and into Athol, where it terminated at what is now Route 2A. The southern portion of the road (Old Enfield Road) is still accessible in Belchertown. The northern trunk follows Pleasant Street and New Sherborn Road in Athol, then the Monson Turnpike (Turnpike Road) in Petersham, where the road had an intersection with Route 122. Much of the route south of this intersection lies within the Quabbin Reservoir State Reservation.Tougias, Michael. Quabbin: A History and Explorers Guide. Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts: On Cape Publications, 2002, p.48. Into the 1970s. MA-21 Started in Forest Park with an Intersection with U.S. Route 5 near the South End Bridge, today Interstate 91 now overtakes that intersection along with MA-83. From there, the route went down Longhill Street until Sumner Avenue. Through the 6 way Intersection with Belmont Avenue and Dickinson Street, known to locals as the X. From there, the route went down Sumner until the intersection with Allen Street which then made a turn onto Cooley Street at the Sixteen Acres section of town. From there, Cooley Street continued north into Parker Street which took drivers to today's terminus, outside of Indian Orchard. There were plans to bypass this with the Springfield Bypass but it was never completed. Only a small part where Summner and Allen Streets were made for the highway and a short highway bypass of Allen and Cooley Streets known as Bicentennial Highway was constructed to relieve passengers. It is unknown why it was shortened, speculation includes to ease the traffic through that section and to keep motorists away since that area of town was some of the most dangerous in the 1970s. Today, MA-83 overtook the route from the X down to Route 5 and Interstate 91.

With nine species and one natural hybrid, the genus is distributed from Costa Rica and Trinidad in the north to Brazil and Bolivia in the south. Common names in their native range are bacaba in Brazil, and palma milpesos (or just milpesos) in Spanish-speaking countries. These terms may also refer to the most well-known member of this genus, O. bacaba, but more precise common names exist for that species. The fruit of Oenocarpus palms are food for various animals, such as the green aracari (Pteroglossus viridis) for which O. bacaba fruit are a mainstay food. They are also locally eaten by humans, and these palms are also used in folk medicine. Their wood is useful for handicraft and the fruits can also be used to produce oil, which is of excellent quality and was used as a substitute for olive oil during WW2.

Life and work According to the limited family records available, Barnard was born in 1837 into a Baptist family in Thaxted, a rural village in Essex. He was one of eight children. His father was a draper and grocer. In 1859, aged 22 he married Fanny Ruffle, also 22. At this time Alfred is thought to have been a grocer residing in Kensington. They had two daughters, Theodora and Edith, and one son, Harold. Barnard is described on the respective birth certificates as a toilet soap exporter, then a merchant and finally as a gentleman. Different addresses are given on the certificates, ranging from Islington in 1861, to the Cavendish Square area in 1869. In the 1881 they are listed as living near Dulwich, London. Curiously, Barnard does not appear on the 1901 census. As secretary of Harper's Weekly Gazette, he visited every working whisky distillery in Great Britain and Ireland from 1885-1887. In all, he visited an incredible 162 distilleries; 129 in Scotland, 29 in Ireland and 4 in England. The result of which was the monumental 500 page The Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom, covering in depth technical information on the distilleries, along with sketches and engravings. Of the original print, only a small number of copies survive to this day, some are in presentation binding (leather) but most have a green cloth binding. Copies of the first edition have changed hands for ¬£2,500. However, a facsimile copy was published in 1987, and has been reprinted three times since. This book has been referred to as possibly the most important book written on whisky.\\" Rarestandfinest.com February 20, 2006 Many of the distilleries Barnard visited have since closed, and in most cases, especially in Ireland, the buildings themselves have disappeared. In other instances the surviving distillery names have changed. Following publication of Whiskey Distilleries he was commissioned by various distilling companies to produce promotional pamphlets. Six are known to still exist and are very rare. They are:How to blend Scotch Whisky for Mackie & Co, Pattison's/Glenfarclas, Johnnie Walker, Watson's of Dundee, the Highland Distillers and Dalmore distillery. He also wrote a thirty four page Pamphlet for Duncan, Alderdice & Co, Newry, Co. Down who had an extensive blending business. A copy is extant in the Newry Mourne and Down, Museum, Newry Co Down. There are plans to reprint the first listed 6 pamphlets in time. Following his first success, Barnard undertook a similar beer tour in 1889-1891 visiting over 110 breweries in Great Britain and Ireland. The end product of this tour was The noted breweries of Great Britain and Ireland, published over three years and in four volumes. They give a great description of the scale of industry at the time and also some biographies on some of the distinguished families involved, such as the Guinnesses. Again, promotional pamphlets were produced though unlike Barnard's whisky pamphlets, which were new and original works, these appear simply to be facsimile reprints of the relevant entry in the main volumes. In any event, the entries in Noted Breweries are generally far more extensive than those in his Distilleries volume. He died in Croydon, South London on 31 May 1918, aged 81.

He has since retired. Dominguez' professional football career spanned 19 years during which he played for teams in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, winning titles with all but one. Early life Dom√≠nguez was born in Buenos Aires and moved to Rosario at an early age with the relocation of his parents'. There, he played in the youth system of Newell's Old Boys. His father coached Lionel Messi in the club's youth divisions. Club career Primak made his professional debut for Newell's Old Boys in 1998, at 18 years. At an early age he was purchased by a third-party and loaned to Talleres de C√≥rdoba along with his teammate Maxi Rodr√≠guez, but he was never authorized to play for the club and returned to Newell's shortly after. He played as a defensive midfielder until 2004, when he was moved to centre back by coach Am√©rico Gallego and he captained the team that won the 2004 Apertura tournament, thus breaking the club's 12-year title drought. The central defender played 18 games (out of 19) during the tournament, all of them as a starter. After winning the league championship with Newell's, Dom√≠nguez was purchased by third-party Media Sports Investment for $2.5 million (US), that loaned him along with fellow Argentine players Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano to Brazilian side SC Corinthians. With his new club, he won the 2005 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A. During the 2007 January transfer window, Dom√≠nguez returned to Argentina to play for Estudiantes de La Plata, under Diego Simeone's coaching. He played with the team the whole year, after which he was signed by Mexico side Am√©rica in January 2008. Although he helped the team to win the 2008 InterLiga and scored in the derby against Chivas de Guadalajara, he was released from his contract at year-end. On 27 January 2009, V√©lez S√°rsfield signed the defender on a free transfer. He immediately established himself as a starter as center back playing along Nicol√°s Otamendi. Dom√≠nguez featured in all 19 games of his first tournament in V√©lez, the 2009 Clausura, helping the team to claim the national championship. He was also a regular along Fernando Ortiz as centre back in V√©lez' 2011 Clausura winning campaign (playing 16 games), as well as the team's 2011 Copa Libertadores semi-finalist campaign (playing all 12 games and scoring one goal). Dom√≠nguez also helped V√©lez to win the 2012 Inicial, starting 18 games and scoring two goals. In that year he was also selected by the fans of V√©lez on an online poll as the club's best player of the year. In 2013, the defender obtained two further titles with V√©lez: the 2012‚Äì13 Superfinal (defeating his former team Newell's Old Boys) and the 2013 Supercopa Argentina (defeating Arsenal de Sarand√≠), in both of which he was a starter for his team. During that year Dom√≠nguez also played his 200th official game with the club in a 1‚Äì1 draw with All Boys. International career On 31 August 2009 Dom√≠nguez was called by coach Diego Maradona for the Argentine national team, along fellow V√©lez S√°rsfield teammates Nicol√°s Otamendi and Emiliano Papa. With Argentina, the defender started the World Cup qualifier games against Brazil and Paraguay (both defeats for Argentina). Dom√≠nguez was later called by coach Alejandro Sabella for the 2011 and 2012 editions of the friendly competition Supercl√°sico de las Am√©ricas, in which he captained the national team. He was also called by Sabella for 2014 World Cup qualifying matches, including the last two against Peru and Uruguay. However, he did not take part of the squad for the World Cup. Personal life Dom√≠nguez studied architecture, but did not get far in his career. He plays guitar and harmonica and enjoys Argentine and British rock.

Transportation Wunnumin Lake First Nation can be accessed primarily through air transportation to Wunnumin Lake Airport; however, during the winter season, one can also travel to this community using the winter roads, The White Highway. Policing Wunnumin Lake is policed by the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service, an Aboriginal-based service. History Wunnumin Lake is called Wanaman-zaaga'igan meaning \\"Vermillion Lake\\", in reference to the vermillion-coloured clay about the lake. Legend says that Wiisagejaak (the \\"Crane manidoo\\") used to hunt for food, found \\"Big Beaver\\" that lived on the Pipestone River and chased \\"Big Beaver\\" and its baby beaver to this area. When Wiisagejaak caught up with \\"Big Beaver\\" and its baby beaver, he killed the baby beaver and put it aside in this particular area with foliage; as the baby beaver laid there in this foliage, it bled from its wound. The blood from the baby beaver's wound seeped into the ground, staining the clay to this colour. Residents of Wunnumin Lake originated from Big Beaver House, Ontario. After a large forest fire, the community at Big Beaver House relocated to two separate location, of which one was Wunnumin Lake.

Brown became a member of the PGA in 1928, and the GCSAA in 1957, after having worked as a caddie in New Jersey. He was a renowned golf club maker and golf teacher during the 1920s and 1930s, and he crafted a set of golf clubs for President Warren G. Harding. In addition to Harding, Brown also crafted clubs for notable persons such as Vice President Charles Davis and Chick Evans. In 1934, he worked as an assistant golf pro at Shawnee in Pennsylvania. It is speculated that the PGA terminated Brown's membership when they discovered that he was African American. They previously believed he was white because of his light skin color but coincidentally at the time of his dismissal the PGA had recently implemented a Caucasian-only clause in its bylaws. Brown purchased Cedar River Golf Club in Indian Lake, New York, in 1947. His son took it over after Brown retired in 1972.  Early life  Brown was born on October 24, 1899, in North Carolina, before later moving to New Jersey as a young boy. It was at the age of eight when he was first introduced golf as he began caddying at the Madison Golf Course. He also worked as a groundskeeper on the facility. His passion for golf continued to grow, and under the tutelage of pro Tom Hucknell he displayed skill in club making. Brown worked for several years at Shawnee-on-the-Delaware as an assistant to the club professionals in addition to maintaining positions at Baltusrol Golf Club and the Hollywood Golf Club, both in New Jersey. Through his continual involvement in and interest in the golfing business, his skill in the sport itself began to cultivate and began to rival his adeptness at club crafting. So much so that many prominent individuals such as President Warren G. Harding purchased sets of his handmade clubs. With his aptitude in both teaching and playing Brown participated professionally in number of local tournaments.  Professional career  In 1928, Brown became the first known African American member of the Professional Golfer's Association. Possessing very light skin, question of his racial identity did not arise. Unbeknownst to many at the time, he had in fact broken through the glass-ceiling of the golfing profession. Then in 1934 without reason or any forewarning his eligibility was revoked. Due to Brown's inexplicable termination, it is speculated that discovery of his black ancestry was the reason for his dismissal from the association. His light skin may have previously gone overlooked and mistaken for inclusion within the Caucasian race. Coincidentally, 1934 is same the year the PGA amended its bylaws to include a \\"Caucasian-only\\" clause. It was not until three decades later in the year 1965 when Brown's application for reinstatement was approved. Formally re-elected to class 'A' membership he was a member of the PGA once again. At the age of 66, his professional career would be short-lived as his touring days were over. Records of his actual participation in major tournaments are scarce and official date of retirement is unknown.  Life post-golf  He did not let his dismissal from the PGA affect his love for the game or impact his involvement in the sport. In fact, in the year 1947, he purchased, managed, and served as the club professional at the Cedar River Golf Club located in Indian Lake, New York, in the Adirondacks. Here his teaching, playing, and crafting of clubs continued. Brown would own and operate the course and facility until his death. He lived the rest of his days in the Adirondacks and from his living quarters he would witness profound change. Specifically in regards to golf the heavily scrutinized and contested \\"Caucasian clause\\" was rescinded in the year 1961. In 1965, Brown's application for reinstatement would be approved and he was readmitted in the PGA.  Family life and death  Brown died on December 22, 1973 at the age of 74. At the time of his death he was survived by his now late widow Ruth, three sons, two brothers, a sister, five grandchildren and a great-grandchild. His first born son Ronald M. Brown was also a man worthy of acknowledgement. Similarly to his father Ronald Brown was a trailblazer in his own right also being at the forefront of an African American first. Ronald Brown served the United States in World War II as a member of the famed Tuskegee Airmen. Sixty years later and a few years after his death Ronald Brown as well as his fellow Tuskegee Airmen pilots were awarded with Congressional Gold Medals for their service and achievement in the war. In June 2011, Dr. Roland Brown, (son of Major Brown and grandson of Dewey Brown, Sr.) donated his father's Congressional Gold Medal to the Adirondack Museum. There is no doubt the Brown's have left a mark in the Adirondack's but their mark left on American history is even greater. Dewey Brown's family lineage has only grown since his death as has an extensive amount of relatives left in his succession.  Legacy  Brown was a pioneer in the golfing profession, being credited as the first known African American in the PGA, but, for all his on-field accomplishments, his legacy will be remembered in terms of his impact off the golf course. From humble beginnings in North Carolina, Brown was a man who climbed the ladder in his profession. He had gone from caddying at various golf clubs to becoming a professional in Professional Golfer's Association. Commonly referenced as a sincere man, Brown was an individual whose social impact can be compared with that of fellow African American trailblazer Jackie Robinson. Brown too had pioneered a sport and was a pivotal figure in the movement of racial integration of blacks in sports. In the book, Adirondack Golf Courses: Past and Present Peter Martin stated, \\"A black man who was to golfing what Jackie Robinson was to major league baseball: a black pioneer in a white world, a superb athlete, a sportsman and a gentleman.\\" Brown conducted himself in a professional manner being known to his peers as a smooth-swinging and dapper fellow. He has been described by sportswriters as the 'Knight of the Fairways' because he was one of God's great gentlemen and sincerity was his trademark.\\" His admittance, termination, and eventual re- admittance into the PGA highlighted change in America and that the fight for equality was much more than a political matter. While enjoying an illustrious career the greatest achievement of the renowned golf club maker, golf teacher, and professional golfer that was Dewey Brown was his social impact. Utilizing his rare skill set and mental fortitude, he overcame many obstacles, paving the way for future generations. Through perseverance and while displaying a great passion for the sport of golf Brown opened the proverbial door for other African American golfers to follow in his footsteps.

He was a member of the first Dunfermline Athletic side to win a major honour, the 1961 Scottish Cup. Playing career After leaving Larkhall Academy, Miller started playing for local side Royal Albert, where he would stay until 1959. He was signed by Dunfermline Athletic before the start of the 1959‚Äì60 season, instantly becoming a first-team regular as the Pars battled against relegation. The arrival of Jock Stein in 1960 transformed the side however, and against the odds they reached 1961 Scottish Cup final against Celtic. Miller played as a wing-half in an initial 0‚Äì0 draw, however an injury to Jackie Williamson required him to move to centre-half for the replay. The subsequent 2‚Äì0 victory enshrined that XI's place in Dunfermline folklore and served to galvanise the entire club. Dunfermline developed into regular challengers at the top end of the league table and Miller notched seven goals as they finished an unprecedented 4th in 1961‚Äì62. The team also enjoyed several notable European campaigns, with Miller's individual highlight coming in the 1962‚Äì63 Fairs Cup, his 2nd-leg goal helping the Pars to a memorable 2‚Äì1 aggregate victory over English giants Everton. Miller was the subject of a lucrative transfer bid from Wolves in October 1964 and the ¬£28,500 on offer proved too much for Dunfermline to resist. However, he failed to settle in the West Midlands and returned to Scotland after just 13 months after 45 appearances, joining league runners-up Heart of Midlothian in November 1965. He spent three seasons at Tynecastle, with the highlight being a run to the final of the 1967‚Äì68 Scottish Cup final, where his former side Dunfermline defeated the Maroons 3‚Äì1. In November 1968, Miller joined Falkirk,Falkirk FC Managers then struggling near the bottom of the First Division. Despite his best efforts they were relegated but bounced back to claim the 1969‚Äì70 Division Two title. By this stage Miller was approaching veteran status and, after two seasons of First Division consolidation with Falkirk, he left Brockville Park in 1972 to become manager of recently relegated Dunfermline Athletic in the summer of 1972. Managerial career Miller was able to lead the side to promotion in his first season in charge, although Clyde took the 1972‚Äì73 Second Division title. Miller's first managerial season in the top flight witnessed Dunfermline avoid relegation on goal difference, however it was largely overshadowed by the death of left-back John Lunn, at only 31 years of age. League reorganisation the next season saw the Pars placed in the new (second tier) First Division but a disastrous 1975‚Äì76 campaign would end in relegation. Miller resigned his position in late 1975 but was quickly back in the game when appointed Falkirk manager in December 1976. The Bairns were also struggling though, and ended the season bottom of the First Division and relegated. When Miller could not secure promotion the following year, finishing 9-point behind the second promotion place, his time at Brockville came to an end. Hamilton Academical was Miller's next port of call, where he worked as commercial manager from 1984. On two occasions he fulfilled the role of caretaker manager, after the departure of Jim Dempsey in 1989 and John Lambie in 1990. Miller died of cancer on 26 December 2008.

He was educated at St Peter's College, Johannesburg, also known as the \\"Black Eton\\" of South Africa (Oliver Tambo was his mathematics teacher before becoming a lawyer and president of the African National Congress).\\"Arthur Maimane\\", South African History Online. Maimane was originally intending to study medicine, when a young priest, Trevor Huddleston (who was involved in the Sophiatown forced removals), persuaded him to take a vacation job at Drum magazine. As a result, Maimane choose journalism as his life career. He was a versatile journalist for Drum, covering a wide spectrum of subjects, including writing sports reports, thriller and interviews with beauty queens and other celebrities. Reporter Joining Drum in the early 1950s, he was mentored by Henry Nxumalo. The photograph of Maimane in Anthony Sampson's 1956 book Drum: A Venture into the New Africa, \\"trilby on back of head, cigarette dangling\\", is an amusing take-off of the Hollywood \\"newshound\\" image, but conceals his innate seriousness as a reporter and analyst of the world around him. Under the pseudonym Arthur Mogale, he wrote a regular series for Drum entitled \\"The Chief\\", in which he described gangster incidents he had heard about in the shebeens. Don Mattera, a leading Sophiatown gangster, took exception to this: \\"The gangsters were pissed off with him and there was a word out that we should wipe this guy off.\\" Maimane moved to Golden City Post, Drum magazine's sister daily paper, as the news editor but did not stay long. In 1958, the year after his friend Nxumalo was murdered by unknown assailants, Maimane moved to Ghana to work on the West African edition of Drum. In 1961, he moved to London. The young editor accepted a position at Reuters and was posted to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania as its East African correspondent. There he met his second wife, Jenny, and, when he was deported from Tanzania after refusing the founding editorship of TANU's new daily and for critically reporting political events, they both returned to London, England. He worked for the BBC African Service at Bush House for a while, and then moved to ITN. In 1976 his novel Victims was published in London by Allison and Busby but was banned in South Africa, although the English Academy of South Africa awarded Maimane its Pringle Award for Creative Writing in 1978. After the 1994 elections in South Africa, he returned and was appointed Features editor of the liberal Weekly Mail. After a brief return to England, he was appointed editor of the Star, South Africa‚Äôs biggest daily (1994‚Äì97). In 2001, Maimane and his wife returned to London. His novel Victims was republished in 2000 as Hate No More. His post-apartheid play, Hang On In There, Nelson, was performed at the Windybrow Theatre in Johannesburg and at the State Theatre in Pretoria, in 1996. Maimane died in 2005 in London, aged 72.

Crampton undertook the first major study of evolution in nature in his research in the Society Islands. Crampton made twelve separate expeditions over the course of his career to Moorea near Tahiti to study the land snail genus Partula, while years more were spent measuring and cataloguing his specimens. In all, he dedicated nearly half-a-century to the study. Crampton served as professor of zoology at Columbia University and Barnard College from 1904 to 1943. He was the curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History. Stephen Jay Gould has cited Crampton as an inspiration, both for his evolutionary observations on Partula, and the enormous dedication and effort required to undertake them. He was also the inspiration for future work on Partula by Bryan Clarke, James Murray and Michael Johnson. This research was central to much of the development of the science of genetics. Crampton's monographs remain some of the most remarkable publications on any species, for their meticulous detail and the beautiful illustrations they contain. His work on the Society Islands species was never finished, his monographs covering only those of Tahiti and Moorea. The volumes on Huahine, Raiatea, Tahaa and Bora Bora were never finished.

It is the seat of the administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Twardog√≥ra. It lies approximately north of Ole≈õnica, and north-east of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw. As of 2019, the town has a population of 6,692. History=Middle Ages The beginnings of Twardog√≥ra go back to the times of Polish rule under the first Piast dynasty. It was then a trade settlement connected to the trade route from Wroc≈Çaw to Pozna≈Ñ. It was inhabited by Poles, descendants of the Silesians tribe, and from the 12th century also settlers from other countries, especially from the German states, came to Twardog√≥ra. The modern name of the town is said to have been created during the First Mongol invasion of Poland in 1241. The inhabitants of the settlement gave the Mongols a hard resistance and hence the name, which means in Polish \\"Hard Mountain\\". Its name also covers terrain topography (Twarda G√≥ra). Town rights were given to Twardog√≥ra by Henry III, Duke of G≈Çog√≥w on August 1, 1293. Although Polish, the town was first mentioned as Vestenberg in 1293. From the beginning of the 14th century, Twardog√≥ra was part of the Duchy of Ole≈õnica, which remained under the rule of the Polish Piast dynasty until 1492, although as a fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia. Early modern period Residents of the city remembered the unpleasant experiences of the Hussite Wars in the late 15th century building a defensive structure. A hundred years later a castle was built there. Twardog√≥ra Palace In 1526, Twardog√≥ra and the Duchy of Ole≈õnica (Oels) came under the suzerainty of the Habsburg Monarchy. At that time, duke John, from the Czech noble Podiebrad family, introduced Lutheranism in 1538. It is presumed that at that time there was already a church (lower) in the city, which was thoroughly renovated in 1587. The Duchy of Oels from 1647 was under the rule of dukes of W√ºrttemberg. During its rule, Twardog√≥ra flourished. Change in Twardog√≥ra was foremost contributed to by Dutches Eleonora Karolina Wirtemberska (1676‚Äì1712). She rebuilt and expanded the town's castle into a Baroque palace. She also took care of the health of the people, the development of the craft, trade and education, as well as the development of charities. In the years 1729‚Äì1738 the church was rebuilt giving it its present shape. In 1742 Silesia became part of the Kingdom of Prussia and the town came under Prussian suzerainty, remaining part of the Duchy of Ole≈õnica. In 1743 Henryk L. von Reichenbach brought the town hardwood, and the town joined the newly created state country in Goszcz a year later. In 1786 the town was inhabited by 1175 people, among whom the most prosperous at the time were the weavers. 19th and 20th centuries At the beginning of the 19th century, two new cemeteries were set up outside the city, separate for Protestants and Catholics, and the old church cemetery was demolished. Catholics built a church in 1869 near the new market. In 1873, a fire destroyed the evangelical church, which was rebuilt three years later in Gothic Revival style. From the middle of the 19th century Twardog√≥ra began to acquire industrial character. Henryk Piirschel founded a mechanical weaving factory in 1852, and Henry Lichtenberg began industrial furniture production. Until 1945 the town was part of Germany. The demographic development of the town in the 19th century (in 1885 ‚Äì 2202 people, and after the merger with the Old Twardog√≥ra in 1910 ‚Äì 3351 people) caused an increase in the town's infrastructure. Before the World War I, a credit bank (1901), a printing house (1907), a court and detention center (1902), a town hall, a cemetery chapel (1906), a town hall (1912) and a new water supply (1901) and electrification of the city was conducted (1910). In 1944, the town was home to 4500 people, who primarily engaged in craft, trade and services. The town had, among other things, an agricultural and general school, two cinemas, a hospital, a child's home and extensive gastronomy. German rule ended in Twardog√≥ra on January 23, 1945, when it came under Polish administration. As a result of Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the town was transferred to Poland in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

After a very successful career at Texas A&M; University, Crite was selected with 53rd overall (7th in third round) pick in the 1987 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns and spent two following seasons in the NBA playing for Suns. Afterwards he played professionally in Europe. At 6'7\\" (2.00 m) and 233 lb (106 kg), he played power forward. Early years Winston Crite was born and raised in Bakersfield, California. He attended South High School Bakersfield, where, as a sophomore, he led his team to the San Joaquin Valley Championship. In his senior year, Crite was voted by the Bakersfield Californian as the All Area Player of the Year, and was later named to the All Northern California all- star team. Texas A&M; University (1983-1987) Crite chose to attend Texas A&M; University and play basketball under coach Shelby Metcalf. In his very first game, against Texas Lutheran in 1983-1984, Crite became the first freshman in Aggie history to post a double-double (in this case, 24 points, 15 rebounds) in his first game. Only one other Aggie freshman, Joseph Jones, has duplicated that feat. Crite started 118 of the 123 games of his career, and showed steady improvement throughout his four years. His freshman year (1983‚Äì1984), Crite averaged 8.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.2 assists, and .9 blocks per game and completed 53% of his field goal attempts. The following year, he averaged 12.1 points per game, 8.2 rebounds, 1.2 assists, and 2.2 blocks, completing 56.7 percent of his field goals. In the 1985-1986 season, Crite completed an impressive 58.0% of his field goals, averaging 13.3 points, 8 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 1.3 blocks per game. By his senior season he was averaging 16.8 points, 2.0 blocks, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game, completing 56.1% of his field goals. For his accomplishments, Crite was a four-time \\"All Southwest West Conference\\" choice and was named \\"All Tournament\\" for three straight years. Just as Crite appeared to be at the top of his game in his senior year, the team began struggling, losing nine of their last eleven games to finish the regular season 14-13. The Aggies were seeded eighth in the Southwest Conference, meaning they would open the conference tournament facing the top-seeded TCU Horned Frogs, who were ranked 15th nationally. After Crite scored thirty points in a stunning upset of TCU, the team defeated the defending tournament champion, Texas Tech before beating number two seed Baylor in the tournament championship game, where Crite was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. Winning the tournament gave the Aggies an automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament, their last NCAA tournament appearance until 2006. Crite holds the Aggie record as the all-time leading shot blocker (200). He is second on the school's list of leading rebounders (913) and for field goal percentage (.562). He has attempted the third-most number of free throws, with 518 attempts, and is the fourth leading Scorer in school history. Crite was inducted into the Texas A&M; Hall of Fame in September 2009. Professional basketball Crite was selected by the Phoenix Suns with the seventh pick in the third round of the 1987 NBA Draft.1987 NBA Draft, basketballreference.com In his first season, 1987‚Äì1988, Crite scored 87 points in his 29 games, averaging 3.0 points per game with 2.2 rebounds and 0.5 assists per game. The following season, he played for a total of only 6 minutes in two games, and made only one rebound, before being placed on the injured list in January 1988. Crite played the 1989 season in Australia's NBL, with the Brisbane Bullets. He made the Northern All-Stars team for the Australian NBL All-Star Game played at the \\"Glasshouse\\" in Melbourne, and played a significant second half in a narrow two-point loss to the South. Crite averaged 20.8 points on 57% shooting from the field, and 7.5 rebounds per game. After some questionable management decisions during the year, Winston left the Bullets in the 1990 season. He then spent several years playing professional basketball in Europe, earning All-League honors in Spain and France. Crite was named the Most Valuable Foreign Player of the French 2nd Division, while playing with ASA Sceaux in 1993 (Pro-B League). He also led that team to a French 2nd Division championship that year. After that season, he was also named to The Buckler all Europe Team. http://www.nblstats.com/players.php?playerid=10248&hyear;=2003-04 Retirement After Crite's retirement from professional basketball, he returned to his hometown of Bakersfield. He was soon approached by parents of local student-athletes to mentor and train their children. In 2002, Crite and his wife Mechelle formed The Footwork Shop, Inc, a basketball training club. Instead of offering more traditional league-type play, Crite's company offers year-round skill training, focusing especially on advanced footwork, without playing actual basketball games. As of April 11, 2016 he is the School Community Specialist and Varsity Boys‚Äô Basketball Coach at Frontier High School also located in Bakersfield.http://frontier.kernhigh.org/new-varsity- boys-basketball-coach-mr-winston-crite/ ReferencesExternal links *NBA statistics @ basketballreference.com 1965 births Living people African-American basketball players American expatriate basketball people in Argentina American expatriate basketball people in Australia American expatriate basketball people in France American expatriate basketball people in Spain American expatriate basketball people in the Philippines Basketball players from California Brisbane Bullets players Cholet Basket players Grand Rapids Hoops players Liga ACB players Montpellier Paillade Basket players Philippine Basketball Association imports Phoenix Suns draft picks Phoenix Suns players Power forwards (basketball) Sportspeople from Bakersfield, California Magnolia Hotshots players Texas A&M; Aggies men's basketball players American men's basketball players ","title":"Winston Crite"},{"id":"9613186","text":"Notomithrax is a genus of crabs of the family Majidae, containing four species: * Notomithrax minor (Filhol, 1885) * Notomithrax spinosus (H.

The rivers Orla and Barycz meet here. As of 2019, the town had a population of 2,662. History Piast Castle in WƒÖsosz WƒÖsosz dates back to the medieval Piast-ruled Kingdom of Poland and its name is of Polish origin. It was granted town rights by Henry III, Duke of G≈Çog√≥w in 1290. It was part of the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w of fragmented Poland and in the 14th century the local castle of the Piast dukes was built. The castle was unsuccessfully besieged by the Hussites in 1432. In 1520 WƒÖsosz passed to the bishops of Wroc≈Çaw and in 1525 it passed again under Piast rule as part of the Duchy of Legnica. After the dissolution of the duchy in 1675, the town became part of Habsburg-ruled Bohemia, in the 18th century it was annexed by Prussia, in 1871 it became part of Germany, and in 1945 it was reintegrated with Poland. During World War II, in 1943, the Germans established a camp for Polish children up to 5 years of age, which were deemed \\"racially worthless\\", and whose mothers were deported to forced labour in Lower Silesia. At least 485 Polish children passed through the camp, and due to its terrible sanitary conditions many died, bodies were transported in wheelbarrows to the local cemetery. 39 children survived until the liberation of the camp. Local pastor Paul Tillmann rescued these children when, during the German evacuation the camp, he opposed the idea of blowing up the building with the children, and looked after them until the town was liberated. As the result of WWII, the town was assigned to Poland. The totality of its populace was expelled for new Polish settlers to find a new home here.

Twenty-eight African National Congress supporters and one soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a protest march when they attempted to enter Bisho (now renamed to Bhisho) to demand the reincorporation of Ciskei into South Africa during the final years of apartheid. Background Bhisho (previously spelled Bisho) was the capital of the Ciskei, a nominally independent homeland (bantustan) for the Xhosa people in South Africa. The government of Ciskei was formed in 1961 under the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951 after the South African government declared it a separate administrative territory. In 1972, the status was elevated to self- governing territory. This coincided with stronger efforts to forcibly remove Xhosa-speakers to Ciskei. On 4 December 1982, Ciskei became an independent republic, recognised only by the South African government and other 'independent' homeland states in South Africa. The system of racially segregated homelands had been a core of apartheid, but between 1990 and 1994, negotiations were taking place between the government of South Africa and the African National Congress (ANC) to end the apartheid system. With multi-racial democratic elections as the likely outcome of the negotiations, the ANC wished to organise and mobilise its supporters in the Ciskei, particularly as it lay in the Eastern Cape area, a traditional stronghold for ANC supporters. However, its military leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo resisted this and prevented the ANC from organising. In 1991, Gqozo formed the African Democratic Movement to counter the ANC in Ciskei. In December of the same year, he was part of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) negotiations. Codesa was a forum made up of government (National Party) and non-government interest groups to negotiate a new constitution and the transition to democracy in South Africa. In March 1992, Gqozo accused the ANC of planning to overthrow him and in August he stopped ANC marchers from entering Ciskei from King William's Town, a town in South Africa, although close enough to Ciskei. Protest march and massacre On 3 September, the ANC sent a memorandum to President F. W. de Klerk demanding that he replace Gqozo with an interim administration which would permit free democratic activity in Ciskei, but De Klerk refused, on the grounds that the Ciskei did not fall under South Africa's jurisdiction. At the time, negotiations had broken down, with the ANC withdrawing following the Boipatong massacre and accusing de Klerk's government of fomenting the violence. As a result, the ANC began a campaign of \\"mass action\\", organising a protest march to occupy Bisho and force Gqozo's resignation. Gqozo sought a court interdict to prevent the march, and the magistrate ruled that it could take place at the homeland's independence stadium, outside Bisho, but could not enter the capital. The ANC refused to recognise the jurisdiction of the Ciskei court. On 7 September, about 80,000 protesters gathered outside Bisho, signalling the wide opposition to Gqozo's rule. The meeting was led by senior ANC leaders including South African Communist Party Secretary General Chris Hani, Cyril Ramaphosa, Steve Tshwete and Ronnie Kasrils. A razor wire was erected on the border between South Africa and Ciskei to prevent the marchers from entering Bisho. When Kasrils led a group trying to break through the Ciskei Defence Force lines to enter Bisho, Ciskei Defence Force soldiers opened fire on the marchers with automatic weapons, killing 28 marchers and one soldier, and injuring over 200. More than 425 rounds were fired, the first fusillade lasting one and a half minutes, and the second lasting a minute. Various inquiries agreed that the order to fire came from Colonel Vakele Archibald Mkosana, who incorrectly told his commanders by radio that his troops were under fire, and was given permission to return fire. Rifleman Mzamile Thomas Gonya was also found to have opened fire with a grenade launcher, killing one marcher. Goldstone Commission The Goldstone Commission was tasked with investigating the massacre, and Justice Richard Goldstone condemned Gqozo for preventing political activity in Ciskei as well as for the lethal brutality of the Ciskei Defence Force troops. It dismissed his claim that the demonstrators had fired first, and it was later found that a Ciskei soldier who died during the shooting had been shot by a fellow soldier. It recommended strong action against Gqozo and those responsible. It also condemned Ronnie Kasrils for his irresponsible action in leading marchers breaking through the razor wire and provoking the forces into opening fire. Aftermath On 8 September 1992, a day after the massacre, the ANC released a statement demanding that Oupa Gqozo be removed as the leader of Ciskei, Section 43 of the Ciskei National Security Act which prevented political activity in Ciskei be revoked and South African Military Intelligence officials be removed from Ciskei. Ultimately, the massacre led to new negotiations between the ANC and the government. Nelson Mandela met de Klerk on 26 September and signed a Record of Understanding, establishing an independent body to oversee police operations. Gqozo remained in power in Ciskei but resigned shortly before the elections of 27 April 1994. A granite monument was erected on the site of the massacre, outside Independence Stadium, off Maitland Road between Bhisho and King William's Town. It was unveiled by Archbishop Desmond Tutu in 1997. The victims were buried in Ginsberg township outside King William's Town. Each year during the month of September, the Bisho Massacre Memorial Lecture is held to commemorate the massacre and various leaders from around South Africa take part in it. Truth Commission hearing and prosecution Only two applications for amnesty for the massacre were received by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, from Colonel Mkosana, who gave the order to open fire, and Rifleman Gonya, who fired a grenade launcher. Gqozo agreed to testify before the TRC, but failed to appear after being admitted to a psychiatric hospital suffering from depression. In 2000, both Mkosana and Gonya were denied amnesty on the grounds that their actions were reckless and disproportionate and not associated with a political motive. Following their failure to receive amnesty, Mkosana and Gonya were charged with one count of murder and Mkosana with 28 counts of culpable homicide. They were found not guilty on all charges on the grounds of self-defence. Testifying at a Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing on the massacre, Gqozo's former deputy, Col Silence Pita, revealed that Gqozo had received a message stating that the Mkhonto Wesizwe was planning coup and would take us where we didn't want to be \\" but the source of the information had not been made clear in the report. Pita said security arrangements for an African National Congress march on September 7, 1992 were left to the Ciskei Defence Force. Former Ciskei foreign affairs minister Mickey Webb testified that the Ciskei government had been maneuvered into a confrontation with the ANC by South Africa's intelligence services. He claimed that South African Military Intelligence and Ciskei's own intelligence agency fed the Ciskei government with misinformation \\"which could only have ended up in confrontation between the authorities and the ANC\\".

Horowitz was a member of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

From 1977 to 1980, he was chairman of the biology division at Caltech. Since 2013, Horowitz has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education. Among advocates of space exploration, he was noted for his opposition to a space program centered on the use of human astronauts. Charlene Anderson recalls, \\"In personal discussions, he could be particularly vociferous on the topic of human versus robotic exploration. Norm argued that human exploration could only interfere with scientific exploration and confuse the public as to why we should explore space. In his view, science should drive the endeavor, not a lust for adventure.\\" Scientific career Horowitz earned his BS in biology at the University of Pittsburgh in 1936 where his experience conducting research as an undergraduate helped to persuade him to pursue further graduate training in science. He later established the endowed Norman H. Horowitz Fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh to support undergraduate research.The Norman H. Horowitz Fellowship, accessdate=2009-02-06 He completed his PhD at Caltech in 1939 under embryologist Albert Tyler, and then became a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in the laboratory of George W. Beadle. Horowitz returned to Caltech as a faculty member in 1946 and stayed at the Institute for the remainder of his career. He served as chair of the Biology Division from 1977 to 1980, and became professor emeritus in 1982.Norman Horowitz Dies; Conducted Experiment with Viking Lander to Search for Life on Mars. Caltech Press Release, June 1, 2005. As a scientist, Horowitz is best known for his discovery and demonstration in 1944 that a metabolic pathway is a series of steps, each catalyzed by a single enzyme. Working with Neurospora crassa, Horowitz demonstrated that each step in the metabolism of arginine from its precursors depends on the intactness of a single gene. His discovery helped to clinch the case for George Beadle and Edward Tatum's \\"one gene-one enzyme hypothesis\\" (a term Horowitz coined for their concept). The importance of the ‚Äúone gene-one enzyme‚Äù concept can only be understood in the context of how geneticists thought about the gene in the first half of the twentieth century. Many geneticists doubted that genes, as definable entities even existed. Rather they attributed the phenotypes of mutants to altered properties of whole chromosomes. Even among geneticists who believed in the existence of individual genes, a vague concern was often expressed that there was no simple causative relationship between genes and proteins. Metzenberg remarked on the stubborn courage required for Horowitz to espouse and defend the initially unpopular idea of ‚Äúone gene-one enzyme‚Äù and to see it through to general acceptance. Another important contribution of Horowitz was his 1945 proposal on the ‚Äúbackward evolution‚Äù of biosynthetic pathways. This proposal provided a framework for understanding the evolution of biosynthetic pathways and presaged the study of molecular evolution. Horowitz proposed that the earliest life forms reproduced themselves by utilizing non-biologic organic molecules in the environment. Depletion of such organic molecules by the early reproducing life forms could have continued until a point was reached where the supply of one of these molecules limited further multiplication. By a process of mutation and natural selection, these life forms then evolved a catalytic activity for utilizing another related available molecule by catalyzing its conversion to the previously limiting molecule. When this precursor molecule was in turn eventually depleted, further mutations allowed the conversion of another available substrate (a pre- precursor) into the precursor. Horowitz considered that repetition of such mutation/selection events formed the basis of the evolution of biosynthetic pathways. Horowitz was head of the Pyrolytic Release experiment during the Viking program.The Times, 27 August 1976, Experiment points to life in Mars soil Dr Beadle (1958 Nobel Prize winner in Medicine) gave credit to Dr. Horowitz for his original work on biological reactions.https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/04/science/04horowitz.html The results from incubating Martian soil with complex media, and from pyrolysis of soil followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of the pyrolysis products, suggested that the surface of Mars is lifeless. Furthermore, in the soil samples analyzed by the Viking program there were no detectable biochemical footprints in the form of organic compounds that might be expected if living organisms ever thrived on Mars. However, in 2013, NASA‚Äôs Curiosity rover provided evidence of an ancient Martian lake (in existence about 3.7 billion years ago) that may have been capable of supporting life for long stretches --- perhaps for millions of years. Thus, although Horowitz‚Äôs pyrolytic release experiments in 1976 provided the first indication that there is no current life on the surface of Mars, it remains possible that life did exist on Mars in the distant past.

Hundreds of men, including many non-Afghans, surrendered near Kunduz and were being held as enemy combatants at Qala-i-Jangi fortress by the Afghan Northern Alliance (United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan) forces for an interrogation by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel interested in al-Qaeda suspects. The prisoners violently revolted and the ensuing fighting escalated into one of the bloodiest engagements of the conflict. It took Northern Alliance fighters, assisted by British and American special forces and air support, six days to quell the revolt. All but 86 prisoners were killed as well as a number of Northern Alliance fighters. The only U.S. fatality was the CIA officer Johnny \\"Mike\\" Spann, the first American to be killed in combat during the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. Among the surviving prisoners were two American citizens suspected of fighting with the Taliban: Yaser Esam Hamdi and John Walker Lindh. Background In late November 2001, with their military situation in northern Afghanistan becoming critical, many Taliban field commanders agreed to surrender to the Northern Alliance General Abdul Rashid Dostum, leader of the ethnic-Uzbek dominated National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, outside the besieged city of Kunduz. Hundreds of Al Ansar \\"guest\\" foreign fighters (mostly from Arabic-speaking countries of the Middle East) also surrendered their weapons, including a large group that had arrived in a convoy one day earlier to a place away of the agreed capitulation site, close to Mazar-i-Sharif. Dostum described the Taliban surrender as a \\"great victory\\" for the Alliance, a bloodless success that would allow the future reconciliation of citizens of Afghanistan. Thousands of prisoners were transported to the Sheberghan Prison (it was alleged that many of them died due to mistreatment during and after the transport). Meanwhile, as the U.S. forces wanted to question the captured foreign fighters about possible links with the al-Qaeda international jihadist network, the Afghans decided to transfer such prisoners to Qala-i-Jangi (\\"the war fortress\\" in Persian), a 19th-century fortress near Mazar-i-Sharif that Dostum had previously used as his headquarters and ammunition depot. On November 24, between 300 and 500Estimates of the number of prisoners vary: some sources place their number at 300 , others at 400 , others at 500 . foreign suspects were transported on flatbed trucks to the fortress, now turned into a prison. The prisoners had not been searched, and some had concealed weapons during the surrender. On the day of the surrender, two prisoners committed suicide with grenades and killed one of Dostum's commanders and some others in two separate incidents at the makeshift prison. Despite the deaths, the National Islamic Movement militia did not reinforce security at the prison.Perry, Alex, \\"Inside the Battle at Qali i Jangi\\", Time, Dec 1, 2001 John Kerry's report for the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations later alleged it was a pre-planned \\"Trojan Horse\\" style operation, a gambit that would allow a die-hard force of foreign fighters to take over a strategically important fortified position at Qala-i-Jangi and capture a massive munitions stockpile.Tora Bora Revisited: How We Failed to Get Bin Laden and Why It Matters Today , page 37 (chapter \\"Qala-i-Jangi: The Trojan Horse\\") Uprising On November 25, two CIA officers, Johnny \\"Mike\\" Spann from the highly secretive Special Activities Division, and Dave \\"Dawson\\" Tyson, an Uzbek speaker and region expert, arrived at Qala-i-Jangi to carry out prisoner interrogations in the fort's courtyard. The CIA officers questioned selected prisoners, especially one Sulayman al-Faris who was an American citizen born as John Walker Lindh (at the time, they noticed only that Lindh was a European-looking prisoner and different from the others, so he was singled out for an interrogation). Approximately two hours after the interviews began, a number of prisoners, some of them with concealed grenades, suddenly stood up and attacked their captors, who were outnumbered about four to one.George Tenet, At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA 2007, pp. 221-224. . Attacking in a suicidal manner, revolting prisoners overran and killed Spann and several Afghan guards; they also appeared to be often much better trained than their Northern Alliance captors, many of whom got shocked and frightened by their enemies' display of skill and fanaticism. The prisoners managed to take over the southern half of the fortress, including the armory and ammunition depot, seizing a large store of small arms, grenades, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, mortars and ammunition.Berntsen, Gary and Ralph Pezzullo. Jawbreaker: The Attack on Bin Laden and Al Qaeda: A Personal Account by the CIA's Key Field Commander 2005, p. 252. With Spann missing in the chaos, Tyson escaped to the northern and more secure part of the fortress, where he was trapped with a television crew from the German ARD network. He borrowed their satellite phone, and called the U.S. embassy in Uzbekistan, requesting reinforcements.house of war ‚Äì www.cnn.com‚Äì Retrieved February 20, 2007 Tyson specifically requested no air support, due to the proximity of allied Afghan forces. CENTCOM sent a quick reaction force from a Task Force Dagger safe house in Mazar-e-Sharif, housing members of Delta Force, some Green Berets and an 8-man team from M Squadron Special Boat Service, the quick reaction force was assembled from whoever was in the building at the time: a headquarters element from 3rd Battalion 5th Special Forces Group, a pair of USAF liaison officers, a handful of CIA SAD operatives and the SBS team.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.73 The Afghans also brought reinforcements: their personnel and a T-55 tank entered the compound and started firing into the prisoner-controlled area. Several other television crews arrived on the scene of the battle, ensuring it got wide media coverage; the successive stages of the fighting were filmed extensively, providing rare footage of special forces units in combat. At 2 pm, a mixed special ops team, formed with nine U.S. Army Special Forces and six British Special Boat Service operators, one of them a U.S. Navy SEAL exchange Operator, arrived and joined the Afghans firing at the prisoners from the northern part of the fort. From 4 pm until nightfall, they directed two U.S. fighter-bomber aircraft for nine airstrikes against the entrenched prisoners, who continued to put up a fierce resistance. Despite Tyson's requests, 500-pound GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs were dropped on the armory, which was serving as a base of fire for the prisoners. He and the German journalists were rescued when a relief action by four U.S. troops enabled them to escape. The next day, the allied Afghan militia set up a command-and-control post near the northern gate to direct their tank and mortar fire. By mid-morning they were joined by U.S./British forces divided into three teams: a close air support team designated CAS-1 that went inside the fortress along the bottom of the northeast tower to direct bombing strikes into the southern courtyard, a second close air support team designated CAS-2 that positioned itself near the main gate of the fortress, and a Quick Reaction Force consisting of four more Special Forces troops, a U.S. Navy surgeon, and eight soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division. At 11 pm, a GBU-31 JDAM guided bomb, weighing 2,000 pounds (957 kg), was dropped, directed by the Air Force Special Tactics combat controller on the CAS-1 team who called in the JDAM strike. The pilot mistakenly punched in the wrong coordinates, hitting the combat controller's position. The bomb's explosion killed at least four (some sources say 30) allied militiamen on the northeast tower above the CAS-1 team, flipped over a friendly tank, and injured all members of the CAS-1 team, including five U.S. and two British operators. That night two AC-130H Spectre gunships (callsigns GRIM 11 and GRIM 14) circled over the fortress, firing at the prisoners. The main ammunition depot was hit, creating a massive explosion which continued to burn throughout the night.Dodge Billingsley on location account of the event and post action interview with AC-130 105mm gunner. One prisoner managed to escape from the fort, only to be captured and lynched by the local population.Mark Kukis, \\"My Heart Became Attached\\": The Strange Journey of John Walker Lindh, pages 126-146. By the morning of November 27, prisoner resistance had slackened. The allied forces mounted a systematic assault supported by tanks and other armored vehicles, and defeated a counterattack by the prisoners. By the end of the day, they had recaptured most of the fort, at that point facing sporadic gunfire and some suicide grenade attacks. The Americans recovered Spann's body, which the prisoners had booby trapped with a grenade. Afghan fighters looted the bodies of prisoners, extracting gold teeth, and killed at least two who were found to be still alive. At that point, the Coalition forces assumed all of the prisoners were dead. In reality, however, well over 100 surviving prisoners had retreated to the basement dungeon of a central building, where they hid and were discovered only when they killed the body collectors who attempted to enter it. The fighting resumed. Northern Alliance fighters fired and threw in grenades and explosives into the basement, and even poured oil in and lit it on fire, but nevertheless the resistance continued. On November 28, General Dostum arrived and personally tried to persuade the last prisoners to surrender, to no effect. The next day, Dostum ordered the dungeon flooded with frigid irrigation water. This tactic worked and the last holdouts finally surrendered on December 1. Of the estimated 300‚Äì500 prisoners brought to the fortress, 86 emerged still alive (some of whom later died of their wounds) from the flooded basement (where more than 60 of them had died), including John Walker Lindh. Some survivors later claimed they did not participate in the battle. One also told The Observer reporter Luke Harding that some wanted to surrender earlier, but a group of seven Arabs took control and did not let them. The Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party's \\"Islamic Turkistan\\" magazine in its 5th edition published an obituary of its member Turghun (Ibn Umar al Turkistani) speaking of his time training at the Al Khaldan training camp and his meeting with Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi. The Uyghurs in Afghanistan fought against the American bombing and the Northern Alliance after the September 11 2001 attacks. Ibn Umar died fighting against Americans at Qala-i-Jangi that month. Aftermath Surviving prisoner John Walker Lindh photographed after being transported to Camp Rhino on December 7, 2001 Of the 86 prisoners who survived the battle, one was found to be John Walker Lindh, an American convert to Islam who had moved to Afghanistan to help the Taliban battle the Northern Alliance prior to the September 11 attacks. Shortly after the battle, an embedded journalist working for CNN, Robert Young Pelton, managed to identify the badly injured and hypothermic Lindh as an American. Lindh was then separated from other prisoners and his life was saved by an American special forces medic. Lindh was later repatriated to the United States to face charges of treason. In 2002, he was found guilty of aiding and supporting the enemy and sentenced to 20 years in prison without parole. In early 2002, at least 50 other surviving prisoners were transferred to Camp X-Ray at the newly constructed Guantanamo Bay detention camp at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. They were mostly Arabs, including 21 Saudis and nine Yemenis, but there were also some nationals from other countries such as Russian national Rasul Kudayev (from Kabardino-Balkaria), who had allegedly joined the Afghanistan-based Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU),Oliver Bullough, Let Our Fame Be Great: Journeys Among the Defiant People of the Caucasus, page 417. and Abdul Jabar, an Uzbek member of the IMU. In 2004, after three years of detention without trial (at first at Camp X-Ray, until his identity was discovered), the U.S. citizen Yaser Esam Hamdi won a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, which affirmed the right of U.S. citizens to habeas corpus and trial; he was released from United States custody without charges and was deported to his native Saudi Arabia. Major Mark E.

Johnny \\"Mike\\" Spann, the only U.S. fatality, was recognized as the first American killed in combat during the U.S. 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. For his \\"extraordinary heroism\\" in fighting off the prisoners long enough to allow his colleagues to escape, Spann was posthumously awarded the CIA's Intelligence Star; because the Intelligence Star is considered analogous to the Silver Star, the Department of Defense allowed him to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.Bob Woodward, Bush At War, Simon and Schuester, 2002, page 317. At Spann's memorial at the cemetery, officials said that, after being attacked, Spann \\"fought with his AK-47 until it ran out of ammunition, then drew his pistol and emptied it, before turning to hand to hand combat which saw him shot.\\" Mike Spann‚Äôs family visited the fortress after his death. Afghan doctors who were present on site at the time of the riot told the Spann family they \\"thought Mike might run and retreat, but he held his position and fought using his AK rifle until out of ammo, and then drew and began firing his pistol,\\" and that the only reason that they and several others were able to live was \\"because Mike stood his position and fought off the prisoners while enabling them the time to run to safety.\\" Controversies Due to the high number of prisoner casualties, and the use of massive firepower against them, the Northern Alliance and the foreign coalition forces were accused of breaking the Geneva Conventions by using disproportionate means.Luke Harding, Simon Tisdall, Nicholas Watt & Richard Norton-Taylor. \\"Fatal errors that led to massacre\\" , The Guardian, December 1, 2001.

Amnesty International called for an independent inquiry,Richard Norton-Taylor. \\"SAS role in fort deaths questioned\\" , The Guardian, December 15, 2001. but the U.S. and British governments rejected this, arguing that the fierce and well- armed resistance of the uprising fully justified the use of air-power and heavy weapons against the revolting prisoners. The Afghan forces were criticized for mismanagement of the prisoners, which is believed to have enabled the uprising. The captives were not properly searched and some carried grenades into the prison. Dostum later admitted this had been a mistake. Also, as Qala-i-Jangi had been previously a Taliban base, many of the prisoners had been there before and knew its layout. Dostum had planned to hold the men at a nearby airfield, but the U.S. was using it to ferry in supplies. By questioning the prisoners in a group, rather than separately, protected by few guards, the interrogators put themselves at risk with men known to be dangerous. George Tenet, director of the CIA, dismissed the accusations of mismanagement and praised his agents as \\"heroes\\";\\"Spann described as a hero\\" . CNN, Nov 28, 2001. in Bush at War, the journalist Bob Woodward described Spann as a hero whose actions saved the lives of many.

Professional career Garri moved to Don Bosco Livorno aged 15, loaned to Zucchetti Montecatini in 1999-00, he played for their youth team before returning to Livorno. He made his professional debut with Mabo Livorno (Don Dosco's parent club) during the 2000-01 season, in the second division Serie A2, helping the side earn a promotion. He then spent the next three seasons in the Serie A with the side. After that successful spell, he signed a three-year deal with fellow Serie A side Lottomatica Roma, however he didn't manage to crack the first team and a mid-season transfer to Spanish side Etosa Alicante was nearly completed before it was scrapped following an injury to his substitute Vassil Evtimov. He was loaned to Angelico Biella for 2005-06, refinding his form to average more than 11 points per game in leading Biella to the title playoffs. He returned to Roma afterwards but his 2006-07 season with the side was no more successful than his first. Garri then signed a three-year contract with Virtus Bologna in August 2007. After one season in Bologna, he returned to Biella in 2008 on another three-year deal, playing two more seasons with the club. In July 2010, he moved to Pepsi Caserta on a two-year deal. After spending the 2011-12 season with Cimberio Varese, Garri returned to the second division (now LegaDue), spending three seasons with respectively Bitumcalor Trento, FMC and Sigma Basket Barcellona. In June 2015, Garri joined Derthona Basket of the Serie A2 (second division). International career Garri played for the Italian under-age teams at the 2000 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship (averaging 8.5 points and 3.8 rebounds in around 18 minutes per game) and at the 2002 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship (15 points and 7.6 rebounds in more than 28 minutes per game). He made his debut for the senior Italian national team on 1 June 2002, scoring five points against Latvia, gradually working his way into the Italy fold over the next two seasons.

The play tells the story of Richard II of England in a romantic fashion, emphasizing the relationship between Richard and his first wife, Queen Anne of Bohemia. The play was a major hit in 1933, playing a significant role in turning its director and leading man John Gielgud into a major star. Audiences found its portrayal of medieval characters speaking like modern people refreshing.Sheridan Morley, John Gielgud: The Authorized Biography, Simon and Schuster, 2010, p.115.

Gielgud had reservations about the play but agreed to test it out for two matin√©e performances at the Arts Theatre. Gielgud finally recognised the play's potential and directed it with himself as Richard at the New Theatre in February 1933. Prior to that production, Gielgud was regarded as a highly respected classical actor based on his performances at the Old Vic, but the overwhelming success of Richard of Bordeaux catapulted him into the status of superstar. The play ran for over a year in the West End (a substantial run for its time). At the time the play was compared to George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan, which was also noted for the refreshingly modern and lighthearted language with which the medieval characters were portrayed speaking.Martial Rose, Forever Juliet: The Life and Letters of Gwen Ffrancon- Davies, 1891-1992, Larks Press, 2003, p.76. The play depicts Richard in the light of the pacifism that was prevalent at the time, after the carnage of World War I. Richard is portrayed as a gentle, refined individual in a brutal militaristic culture, whose \\"struggle for peace is fine and ennobling\\". Niloufer Harben, Twentieth-century English History Plays: From Shaw to Bond, Rowman & Littlefield, 1988, p.103-4. The depiction of Richard intentionally diverged radically from Shakespeare's portrayal of him as a self-dramatising narcissist preoccupied with his divine right to rule. Many audience members came to see the play several times, and the production was notable for the fact that souvenir dolls were created and marketed depicting the actors in character.Lawson, Mark, \\"The play's the thing\\", The Guardian, Saturday 29 March 2008. Productions It went on to play in the British provinces many times, first on the original tour with Gielgud, then with other actors, on tour and in repertory revivals. Robert Morley variously played York and Gloucester in it. Michael Redgrave played Richard at Liverpool Playhouse, and John Clements at the Intimate Theatre in Palmer's Green. The play crossed the Atlantic to Broadway in 1934 with Dennis King as Richard, but without Gielgud in the role, the play ran for only 38 performances. The play was performed on television in 1938 with Andrew Osborn as Richard and the original Queen Anne, Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies. After the War, Osborn again played the part on the small screen, now with Joyce Heron as the Queen. Peter Cushing starred in 1955 in another BBC television version, which survives and has been shown at the National Film Theatre. For BBC radio, Griffith Jones played the young King in 1946. Probably because its brand of 1930s pacifism became discredited as appeasement, the play is rarely revived. However, Laurence Payne played the King at the old theatre at Guildford after the War, when Kenneth Williams was John Maudelyn. Gielgud himself reprised his stage role at the microphone in 1941 and 1952. Some of the latter broadcast can be heard on a commercially released recording of Gielgud's audio work. Martin Jarvis was well-received as Richard in a 1974 radio production. Gielgud wrote a letter of congratulation to Jarvis on his performance. Projected film Gielgud tried to make one of his then rare film appearances in the role in the 1930s and teamed with Alexander Korda to produce it, but the project fell through. He wrote to Douglas Fairbanks Jr., hoping to interest him in the project, and suggested Lillian Gish for the role of Richard's wife Anne. He later tried to persuade Dirk Bogarde to play the part on film in the 1960s, but to no avail.Mangan, Richard (ed), Gielgud, John, Sir John Gielgud: A Life in Letters, Arcade Publishing, 2004, pp.32, 203.

Early life and education He was born in Bardstown, Kentucky at Wickland to Governor (and later U.S. Postmaster General), Charles A. Wickliffe. His maternal grandfather was the famed Colonel Crips, an Indian fighter in Kentucky. Wickliffe attended several schools including St. Joseph's College in Bardstown and Augusta College. He graduated from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky in 1840 and resided in Washington, DC during his father's tenure as Postmaster General in the Tyler Administration. He studied law under United States Attorney General Hugh Lagare and was admitted to the Kentucky bar. Move to Louisiana In 1843, Wickliffe married Anna Dawson, the daughter of Louisiana Congressman John Bennett Dawson and niece of Louisiana Governor Isaac Johnson. In 1846, the Wickliffes moved to St. Francisville, Louisiana so Robert could recover from pneumonia at his wife's family's plantation, Wyoming. Wickliffe ran for the Louisiana State Senate in 1851 as a Democrat and won. Reelected in 1853, he is appointed Chairman of the Commission on Public Education, and became President Pro Tempore of the Louisiana Senate when W. W. Farmer became Lieutenant Governor. When Farmer died in office in 1854, Wickliffe, as President Pro Temp, became Lieutenant Governor. In 1855, Wickliffe was nominated as the Democratic candidate for Governor of Louisiana. He went on to defeat Charles Derbigny, son of former Governor Pierre Derbigny, who was running on the Know Nothing ticket. In winning, Wickliffe drew 3,000 more votes than Derbigny and carried 31 of 48 parishes. In his inaugural address in Baton Rouge, Governor Wickliffe advocated a united Democratic South to protect state's rights and he championed the expansion of American power to the Caribbean, Mexico, Cuba and Central America in order to protect slavery in the United States. His administration continued the trend of railroad building, but critics claimed he ignored public education. The Panic of 1857 caused unrest and depression throughout the country and Louisiana was hard hit. Governor Wickliffe blamed a loosely managed Board of Currency in Louisiana. As a consequence, he ordered banks to make weekly statements to the Board of Currency. The unrest changed to violence in New Orleans, which was under Know Nothing control, and Wickliffe was forced to dispatch the militia to ensure the validity of the 1858 elections. After his term as Governor ended, Wickliffe returned to planting and the practice of law in St. Francisville. In the Presidential election of 1860, Wickliffe joined Senator Pierre Soul√© in backing Stephen A. Douglas. The other Louisiana Senator, John Slidell, backed former Vice President John C. Breckinridge from Kentucky. Wickliffe was selected to be a delegate for Douglas at the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1861, Wickliffe did not actively support secession and during the Civil War he tried to act as an intermediary between the Confederacy and the Union. After the war was over, in 1865, Wickliffe was elected to the United States House of Representatives representing Louisiana's 3rd congressional district. He was not seated as Louisiana was deemed \\"not reconstructed.\\" Wickliffe married his second wife, Anna Davis Anderson in 1870. He was elected a delegate to the Democratic National Convention supporting Samuel J. Tilden in 1876 and in 1884 was delegate supporting Grover Cleveland. In 1892, he reentered electoral politics when he was nominated for Lieutenant Governor by the Louisiana Lottery faction of the Democratic Party. Wickliffe lost to anti-lottery Democrats led by Murphy James Foster. Wickliffe died while visiting relatives in Kentucky on April 18, 1895.

The book was released on May 4, 2004 by William Morrow and Company. By 2008 Kevin Spacey's Trigger Street Productions has the film rights to the book. Plot summary In 1992, twenty Ivy League football players visit Japan, to play an exhibition match against Japanese college kids. On this trip, Princeton University's contribution to that all-star-Ivy team, John Malcolm, encountered a Princeton alum, Dean Carney (also a pseudonym).Carney is thought to be based on Richard Tavoso managing director of RBC Capital Markets and head there of Global Arbitrage and Trading. Tavoso spent seven years at Kidder Peabody in the equity derivatives group, and built and managed its Tokyo equity derivatives business from 1990 to 1993. He was awarded Kidder Peabody's equity trader of the year for his efforts in 1992. He graduated with a major in history from Princeton University. Carney was an executive in Kidder Peabody's Tokyo office, and he suggested Malcolm contact him about a job if his pro football career did not pan out. When it did not, and following a job search on Wall Street, Malcolm contacted Carney in 1993. Malcolm then became one of KP's two Osaka-based traders. This lasted until April 1994, when KP discovered a $350 million \\"accounting glitch,\\" and assigned responsibility for the glitch to one of its managing directors, Joseph Jett. KP (and its corporate parent, General Electric) made sweeping cutbacks in their trading operations as a result. Both Carney and Malcolm‚Äîneither of whom had anything to do with Jett's accounting trickery‚Äîwere out of jobs, and they went their separate ways. Malcolm took a position with a venerable English bank, Barings. He was again to work out of Osaka, but this time his orders were coming from Singapore, where Barings' star trader, Nick Leeson, held court. Leeson, though, was making huge unauthorized trades during this period. In January 1995 he made an enormous bet on a rise in the key Japanese stock exchange index, known as the Nikkei (large enough so that if he won, he would recover all his losses). However, the huge bet went against him, due to the Kobe earthquake (January 17) and its devastating effects on Japan's economy. After a brief period as a fugitive, Leeson was captured and did prison time. Meanwhile, Barings suffered historic loses from the gamble, and later went into receivership. For the second time in eight months, a superior's malfeasance had cost Malcolm a job. He called Carney for help. Carney, meanwhile, had founded a hedge fund, and Malcolm was soon trading for it, primarily index arbitrage. In 1994, the Hong Kong government created a tracker fund for the Hang Seng (the Hong Kong equivalent of the Dow Jones or the Nikkei; see Tracker Fund of Hong Kong). In 1995, after Malcolm was settled into his Tokyo job, a company named Pacific Century Cyberworks (PCC) merged with Hong Kong Telecom, and under the terms of the tracker funds' charter, its managers had to buy $225 million worth of PCC stock. This was widely known, and so several traders were \\"front running\\" this deal, i.e. buying PCC stock ahead of the fund's expected purchases. Malcolm, though, discovered that the tracker fund was not going to buy the PCC stock through the exchanges at all. It made a private off-exchange deal with PCC's founder Richard Li. This meant that, when the day of the expected fund purchases arrived and no purchases took place, there'd be a strong downward pressure on the stock price. Accordingly, on Malcolm's suggestion, Carney's hedge fund took a \\"short\\" position on $100 million of PCC stock. In the event, the tracking fund did not make the expected purchases, and the price dropped dramatically‚ÄîMalcolm covered the short position, winning his firm more than twenty million dollars. This one deal made Malcolm a star, known to expat western traders throughout east Asia as their \\"hot young gunslinger.\\" The ending of the book turns on another, quite similar, but even larger deal involving the addition to the Nikkei index of several high-tech firms. This is the deal that justifies the book‚ÄîMalcolm made Carney's firm five hundred million dollars in cash out of the restructuring of the Nikkei. Disillusioned, Malcolm then leaves Carney's employ and heads for semi-retirement in Bermuda, where he still does light trading.

It was Gnome-Rh√¥ne's major aircraft engine prior to World War II, and matured into a highly sought-after design that would see licensed production throughout Europe and Japan. Thousands of Mistral Major engines were produced, used on a wide variety of aircraft. Design and development In 1921 Gnome-Rh√¥ne purchased a license for the highly successful Bristol Jupiter engine and produced it until about 1930, alongside the smaller Bristol Titan. Starting in 1926, however, they used the basic design of the Titan to produce a family of new engines, the so-called \\"K series\\". These started with the 5K Titan, followed by the 7K Titan Major and 9K Mistral. By 1930, 6,000 of these engines had been delivered. However, the aircraft industry at that time was rapidly evolving and producing much larger aircraft that demanded larger engines to power them. Gnome-Rh√¥ne responded by developing the 7K into a two- row version that became the 14K Mistral Major. The first test examples were running in 1929. As the Jupiter had set the pattern for one-row radials in the 1920s, the Mistral Major became a canonical design for twin-row radials of the 1930s. It was widely licensed and formed the basis for many successful designs. Among the licensees were Industria AeronauticƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ in Romania, Manfred Weiss in Hungary, Alvis of the UK, Tumansky in the USSR, Walter of Czechoslovakia, and Isotta Fraschini and Piaggio in Italy. Nakajima in Japan also licensed it, but did not put it into production, developing their own designs based on features taken from the Mistral and other designs.

The Pet√©n-Veracruz moist forests mostly occupy a coastal lowland with meandering rivers, and includes the Lacandon Forest of Chiapas and the Pet√©n Basin of Guatemala. ;Adjacent ecoregions The ecoregion is bounded on the south by a series of mountain ranges and highlands, including the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca, Sierra Madre de Chiapas, Chiapas Plateau, and Guatemalan Highlands, where the lowland Pet√©n-Veracruz forests yield to montane moist forests and pine-oak forests. In central Veracruz, the Veracruz dry forests separate the Pet√©n-Veracruz moist forests from the Veracruz moist forests further north. The western portion of the ecoregion mostly extends to the Gulf of Mexico, although the montane forests of the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the flooded forests and wetlands of the Pantanos de Centla constitute distinct ecoregions. The eastern portion of the ecoregion is bounded on the north by the Yucat√°n moist forests, which extend east and west across the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The Pet√©n-Veracruz moist forests extend east to the Caribbean Sea in Belize, surrounding enclaves of Belizian pine forests in the Maya Mountains and near the coast. The Belizean Coast mangroves run along the Caribbean coast. People The northern Pet√©n-Veracruz moist forests were home to the Olmec culture, which built cities between 1200 and 400 BCE. The Classic Maya civilisation (250-900 CE) was centered in the eastern and southern portions of the ecoregion, from Tabasco and northern Chiapas across northern Guatemala to Belize.

The film starred yesteryear actress, Leela Naidu, in a comeback role after many decades. The film was selected for the Indian Panorama at Filmotsav 1986, and for the Indian Film Retrospective, Lisbon 1986. It was later invited to the London Film Festival 1986.Shyam Benegal Awards Overview Set in 1961 Goa, when colonial rule of the Portuguese was in its last gasp,Trikaal - Overview New York Times. the movie revolves around the life and tribulations of a fictional Goan Christian family called \\"Souza Soares\\" Liberally sprinkled with dashes of humor, this is a fast-paced drama about a family and their friends who lived through the transition of Goa from a Portuguese colony to a state governed by India. Ana (Sushma Prakash) is about to become engaged (unwillingly) to the unappealing Erasmo when her beloved grandfather suddenly dies. Her grandmother (Leela Naidu) is so overwhelmed by grief that Ana's engagement is put on hold indefinitely (along with everything else) while granny tries to contact the spirit of her dead husband using her maid Milagrinia (Neena Gupta) as her medium. But her wires get crossed each time and instead of grandpa (Ernesto Souzasuarez), she brings forth ghosts of people the family has wronged in the past. Meanwhile, Anna‚Äôs real love - Leon (Dalip Tahil), an anti-Portuguese anarchist, is hiding out in the cellar. At Anna‚Äôs engagement to Erasmo (Lucky Ali), she faints because (as he soon finds out) she is pregnant, but not by him. Ruiz (Naseeruddin Shah) also pursues Anna who never reciprocates his feelings. However, Ruiz impregnates Milagrinia. Anna elopes with the love of her life - Leon - leaving a letter and later is revealed that is settled in Portugal with husband and her child whom she names after her grandfather - Ernesto. Milagrinia also gives birth to a baby and is later married to an old man from a foreign land. These and other events are revealed in flashbacks as the now grown up Ruiz [Naseeruddin Shah], a former guest of the house, returns to visit 25 years later. The film was shot in the ancestral home of Mario Miranda, at Loutolim, Goa, and is loosely based on Miranda and his family. Benegal admitted to having been deeply influenced by Miranda's house and family after a visit, prompting him to make the movie. The movie ends with Naseeruddin Shah‚Äôs monologue which actually questions the action of characters within the movie including his. He wonders what brought him back after so many years. Was it the grand manor? Or Dona Maria? Or Anna? Or was it, in fact, Millagrenia, who in his view was only a servant and a commodity that was reared as fodder for use by others? He then reconciles with himself and his past by questioning how long can a criminal carry the guilt of a past crime? Everything fades under layers of time and all that remains is sweet memory.

Productivity, Innovation & Technology eJournal. Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 27 January 2020. The digital economy is also referred to as the Internet Economy, New Economy, or Web Economy. Increasingly, the digital economy is intertwined with the traditional economy, making a clear delineation harder. It results from billions of everyday online connections among people, businesses, devices, data, and processes. It is based on the interconnectedness of people, organizations, and machines that results from the Internet, mobile technology and the internet of things (IoT). Digital economy is underpinned by the spread of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) across all business sectors to enhance its productivity. Digital transformation of the economy is undermining conventional notions about how businesses are structured, how consumers obtain services, informations and goods and how states need to adapt to these new regulatory challenges.  Definition  The Digital Economy also referred as the New Economy.It refers to an Economy in which digital computing technologies are used in Economic Activities. The term 'Digital Economy' was first mentioned in Japan by a Japanese professor and research economist in the midst of Japan's recession of the 1990s. In the west the term followed and was coined in Don Tapscott's 1995 book, The Digital Economy: Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence. This was among the first books to consider how the Internet would change the way we did business. According to Thomas Mesenbourg (2001), three main components of the 'Digital Economy' concept can be identified: *E-business infrastructure (hardware, software, telecom, networks, human capital, etc.), *E-business (how business is conducted, any process that an organization conducts over computer-mediated networks), *E-commerce (transfer of goods, for example when a book is sold online). Bill Imlah comments, new applications are blurring these boundaries and adding complexity; for example, social media and Internet search. : In the last decade of the 20th century. Nicholas Negroponte (1995) used a metaphor of shifting from processing atoms to processing bits. \\"The problem is simple. When information is embodied in atoms, there is a need for all sorts of industrial-age means and huge corporations for delivery. But suddenly, when the focus shifts to bits, the traditional big guys are no longer needed. Do- it-yourself publishing on the Internet makes sense. It does not for a paper copy.\\" In this new economy, digital networking and communication infrastructures provide a global platform over which people and organizations devise strategies, interact, communicate, collaborate and search for information. More recently, Digital Economy has been defined as the branch of economics studying zero marginal cost intangible goods over the Net.  Digital platforms  An online platform operator is any natural or legal person offering, on a professional basis, whether remunerated or not, an online communication service to the public based on:  Classification or referencing, by using computer algorithms, content, goods or services offered or put online by third parties;  Or the connection of several parties for the sale of goods, the provision of a service or the exchange or sharing of content, goods or services.  Spread of Information, Communication Technologies (ICT)  The widespread adoption of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) combined with the rapid decline in price and increase in the performance of these technologies, has contributed to the develop new activities in both the private and public sector. These new technologies allow market reach and lower the costs, it offers a window of opportunities to development new products and services that were not needed before. This field changes the ways multinational enterprises (MNE), as well as, start up are doing business and change the design of their business models. Economic Impact The Digital Economy is worth three trillion dollars today. This is about 30% of the S&P; 500, six times the U.S.‚Äô annual trade deficit or more than the GDP of the United Kingdom. What is impressive is the fact that this entire value has been generated in the past 20 years since the launch of the Internet. It is widely accepted that the growth of the digital economy has widespread impact on the whole economy. Various attempts at categorizing the size of the impact on traditional sectors have been made.The New Digital Economy - How it will transform business, Oxford EconomicsTaking leadership in a digital economy , Deloitte Digital & Telstra The Boston Consulting Group discussed ‚Äúfour waves of change sweeping over consumer goods and retail‚Äù, for instance.Digital‚Äôs Disruption of Consumer Goods and Retail. bcg.perspectives (2012-11-15). Retrieved on 2013-07-23. In 2012, Deloitte ranked six industry sectors as having a ‚Äúshort fuse‚Äù and to experience a \\"big bang‚Äù as a result of the digital economy.Deloitte Australia: Digital disruption - Short fuse, big bang?. Econsultancy (2012-10-22). Retrieved on 2013-07-23. Telstra, a leading Australian telecommunications provider, describes how competition will become more global and more intense as a result of the digital economy. In 2016, the Digital Economy represented $11.5 trillion, or 15.5 percent of global GDP ‚Äì 18.4 percent of GDP in developed economies and 10 per cent in developing economies, on average. It found that the digital economy had grown two and a half times faster than global GDP over the previous 15 years, almost doubling in size since 2000. Most of the value in the digital economy was produced in only a few economies: the United States (35 percent), China (13 percent) and Japan (8 percent). The EU together with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway accounted for another 25 percent.  Impact on Retail  The digital economy has had a substantial impact on retail sales of consumer product goods. One effect has been the fast proliferation of retailers with no physical presence, such as eBay or Amazon. Additionally, traditional retailers, like WalMart and Macy's have restructured their businesses to adapt to a digital economy. Some retailers, like Forever 21, have declared bankruptcy as a result of their failure to anticipate and adapt to a digital economy. Others, such as Bebe stores have worked with outside vendors to completely convert their business one that is exclusively digital. These vendors, such as IBM, Microsoft and Branded Online, have enabled smaller retailers to compete with large, multi- national established brands.  Key features = Mobility  Mobility of intangibles = Both development and exploitation of intangible assets is a key feature of the digital economy. This investment in and development of intangibles such as software is a core contributor to value creation and economic growth for companies in the digital economy. In early 2000, companies have started to substantially increase the amount of capital advocated to intangibles such as branding, design and, technology rather than in hardware, machinery or property. = Mobility of business functions = Advancements in information and communication technologies (ICT) have significantly reduced the cost associated with the organization and coordination of complex activities over a long period. Long businesses are increasingly able to manage their global operations on an integrated basis from a central location that may be removed geographically from both the locations in which the operations are carried out and the locations in which their suppliers or customers are located. Consequently, it allowed to expand access to remote markets and thus, provided an opportunity to provide those goods and services across the borders.  Reliance on Data  The Digital economy relies on personal data collection. In 1995, the Data Protection directive (Directive 95/46/CE, art.2), defined data as ‚Äúany information relating to a natural person who can be identified by reference to his identification number or to information which is specific to him‚Äù. At that time, this regulation emerged in response to the need to integrate the European market. By adopting common European data protection standards, the EU was able to harmonize conflicting national laws that were emerging as a trade barrier, inhibiting commerce in Europe. For this reason, GDPR and its predecessor were viewed as internal market instruments, facilitating the creation of a digital, single market by allowing an unhindered flow of data within the entire common market. Due to its ability to bridge the information asymmetry between supply and demand, data now has an economic value. When platforms compile personal data, they gather preferences and interests, which allow companies to exert a targeted action on the consumer through advertising. Algorithms classify, reference and prioritize the preferences of individuals to better predict their behavior. Via free access to platforms in exchange for the collection of personal data, they make the content non-rival. Thus, the intangibility of content tends to give a collective natural aspect to this information accessible to everyone, to benefit public good which would create a digital public space. The McKinsey Global Institute Report (McKinsey Global Institute report, 2014) notes five broad ways in which leveraging big data can create value for businesses: # Creating transparency by making data more easily accessible in a promptly on time to stakeholders with the capacity to use the data. # Managing performance by enabling experimentation to analyze variability in performance and understand its root causes. # Segmenting populations to customize products and services. # Improve decision making by replacing or supporting human decision making with automated algorithms. # Improve the development of new business models, products, and services. In 2011, the Boston Consulting Group estimated that personal data collected in Europe was worth 315 billion euros.  Network effect  This new economic model is based on the 'Network effect'. It occurs when the value of a product or service to the user increases exponentially with the number of other users using the same product or service. For instance, WhatsApp provides a free communication platform with friends and contacts. The utility to use it relies on the fact that a substantial part of or friends and colleagues are already users. The attractivity relies here on the snowball effect  Multi-sided market  The Digital market is a market can be labeled as a ‚Äòmulti-sided‚Äô market. The notion developed by French Nobel prize laureate Jean Tirole is based on the idea that platforms are ‚Äòtwo-sided‚Äô. This feature allows to explain why these platforms can propose freely their content, with customers on one side and the software developers or advertisers on the other. On a market where multiple groups of persons interact through platforms as intermediaries, the decisions of each group affect the outcome of the other group of persons through a positive or negative externality. When the users spend time on a page or click on links, this creates a positive externality for the advertiser displaying a banner there. The digital Multinational enterprises (MNEs) do not collect revenue from the user side but from the advertiser side, thanks to the sale of online advertisement.  Tendency to oligopoly and monopoly formation  As a result, the outcomes of these intertwined and combined effects tend to lead to the formation of dominant market positions, also called digital monopoly or oligopoly In this sense, digital platforms such as the GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon) can be considered as first movers -large companies that introduce a service or a product on an immature market, allowing that company to establish strong brand recognition and service loyalty.

Public incumbents have tried to respond to the regulatory challenge imposed by the Digital economy, among which is tax evasion. Due to the immaterial nature of digital activities, these digital multinational enterprises (MNEs) are extremely mobile, which allows them to optimize tax evasion. They can carry out high volumes of sales from a tax jurisdiction. Concretely, governments face MNE fiscal optimization from companies locating their activity in the countries where tax is the lowest. On the other hand, companies can undergo double-taxation for the same activity or be confronted with legal and tax vagueness. The Conseil National du Num√©rique concluded that the shortfall in corporate tax gain for Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook was worth approximately 500 million euros in 2012.  Energy use  The Digital Economy uses a tenth of the world's electricity. The move to the cloud has also caused the rise in electricity use and carbon emissions by the digital economy. A server room at a data center can use, on average, enough electricity to power 180,000 homes. The Digital Economy can be used for mining Bitcoin which, according to Digiconomist, uses an average of 70.69 TWh of electricity per year. The number of households that can be powered using the amount of power that bitcoin mining uses is around 6.5 million in the US. Cashless societyEU Digital area = Remaining barriers to fulfill the Digital Single Market  The Digital Single Market (DSM) was included as part of the SMA I and SMA II initiatives. Even if the question had already come up earlier in 1990 and was brought up again later in 2010, it emerged at a sensitive moment in the post-crisis of 2008, used as a catalyst for action. The crisis opened a window for opportunities to place the Single Market upfront in the European agenda and was aimed to resolve two issues: financial supervision and economic coordination. This gave a new dimension to the Market. The proposal for the DSM had been made under the strategy of the Commission entitled ‚ÄúDigital Agenda for Europe‚Äù in the political guidelines of the second Barroso Commission and pointed out the need to eliminate barriers in order to implement the European Digital Market as an attempt to relaunch the Single Market. This strategy was similar to the one used for the Internal Market in 1985 and focused on one of the weaknesses of this latter namely the fragmentation of the national digital market. Building on the Monti report, the communication 'Towards a Single Market Act' detailed 50 proposals to reform the SM by the end of 2012. But the DSM was only adopted in 2015 and the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council was made in September 2016. The DSM is presented as a key priority in the economy of Union, even if there were several attempts to deepen the integration, there are still obstacles remaining. The creation of the DSM constitutes, a catalyst to resolve several issues, and was supposed to have a widespread multiplier effect throughout sectors across the EU. The EU Commission had to face several obstacles. The commission acts in a way to deeply transform the SM. However, the EC lack of political support to enhance the impact of its decision The issue of the low salience was a causal factor explaining the limits of the commission's commitment to reform the single market. Even though the member states approved the DSM, and the definition for the DSM was accepted by European institutions as a key priority, only one proposal was adopted at the end of 2012. Despite being a priority in the SMA I & II, legislative initiatives failed due to the high cost of implementation measures. Also, there were its potential ‚Äòblockbuster for economic gains‚Äô and the protest of citizens against sovereign debt countries rescues and bail-out banks. The slow adoption of the proposal is partly due to Member States‚Äô protectionist temptations after the economic crisis. Each state wanted to put forward its preferences and legislation about concerning this field. With regard to artificial intelligence (AI), the Commission adopted various initiatives with no meaningful coordination. The more pervasive the digital ecosystem becomes, the more sector-specific regulatory framework should be merged into general regimes. Even if the Commission used the crisis as a window of opportunity, it did not allow to go deeper and further in implementing a high transformation of the Single Market (SM). The crisis context pushed the political actors to move forward to better manage the crisis, but it does not permit to fully implement the DSM. = Current challenges = One of the key priorities of the EU is to guarantee fair competition. Yet, within the Digital Market, the competition seems to be distorted. The more network effects are exerted, the higher the barriers to entry (difficulty for a new entrant to enter the market and compete) in the hub market. Vertical or horizontal mergers and acquisitions take place in closed ecosystems. In order to limit this digital ecosystem to absorb all the market are the tools, the EU aims to qualify them either as an ‚Äúabuse of dominant position‚Äù or a ‚Äúcartel‚Äù which are against the competition prosperity within the Single Market. Digital companies such as the GAFA prosper thanks to their various free services that they make available to consumers, which seems to be beneficial for consumers, but less for other firms to compete in a fairway. It seems difficult for the regulators to sanction them, in the way that the GAFA provides jobs and services worldwide. = Challenges for the regulator = The problems remain plural for the regulators. They need to identify and define platforms. There is no possibility to regulate exante to limit the size of the platform. The European Commission can sanction afterwards when the platform abuse already of its dominant position. Moreover, Member-states lack coordination, and may be independent of the regulator, who can not have a global vision of the market. Tax evasion of digital MNEs has become a growing concern for most of the European governments, including the European Commission. Attracting foreign investment is less and less seen as a relevant reason to implement tax cuts. Aside from the fiscal revenue shortfall, this issue has taken a political turn in recent years since people and politicians feel that, in a time of financial crisis, these highly profitable firms do not contribute to the national effort.  The main strength within the EU digital policy  Digital Market is characterized by its heterogeneity The European Market is in a difficult position to compete with other advanced countries within the Digital World (such as US or China). There are currently no European digital champions. The European Digital Market is divided in regulations, standards, usages and languages The MS cannot meet the demand, or support innovation (R&D;), due to the fact that the digital environment is by nature transborder. As noted by the European parliament, taxation on Digital Market could bring about 415bn euros to the EU economy, and be considered as an incentive to further deepen the EU integration (EP opinion's 2014). = Mechanisms of control = The EU control ex-post (in the case of abuse of dominance for example) and seems to be very cautious in term of concurrence (exclusive competence). The EU sanctions cartels‚Äô behavior and examines mergers in order to preserve competition and protect small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to enter the market. Within the digital market, the merger is the rule to build a digital giant, it can be a brake to construct digital European giant. Indeed, in a way, the EU regulator may handicap giant to build themselves, and do not inject as well money in the sector. Moreover, the EU could be a leader in regulation to protect people working in the digital sector or for the digital sector (such as Uber‚Äôs driver, a case recently in France), which could a window of opportunity. However, the EU needs to be cautious with its regulation in order to create barriers at the market entry. = European Commission versus Google = The European Commission (EC) decided to fine Google ‚Ç¨2.42 billion for abusing its dominant position as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to Google Shopping. The EC aimed to pave the way to concurrent who suffers from its abuse of dominant position. Moreover, it proved that the strategy of the EC does work and may fine companies at a great rate. = Junker Commission = The Digital Economy has been a concern for the Commission concern since the 1st Barroso Commission. Yet, it is only under the Junker that the strategy of the DSM was adopted on the 6th May 2015 as it was ranked as the second priority out of the 10 priorities for the new Commission‚Äôs mandate. Throughout this document, the DSM emphasized 3 policy pillars: # improving access to digital goods and services # an environment where digital networks and services can prosper # digital as a driver of growth. As a key priority for the newly President-elect Juncker, he made Andrus Ansip, the vice-president of the Commission, in charge of the DSM. The decision to approach the DSM from a different point of view is also because the digital space is in constant evolution with the growing importance of online platform and the change of market share. The DSM was a priority because of its economic importance; the total of EU e-commerce reached 240 billion ‚Ç¨ in 2011, and out of that 44 billion were cross-border trade between member state.  Within the new commission  In 2020, the digital economy continues to be a top priority for the EC, and belongs once again to the agenda of the Commission president. Frans Timmermans has been designed to be the vice president in charge of one of the six priorities of the EC, called ‚ÄúA Europe fit for digital age‚Äù. The priority is elaborated as follow, EC is working on a digital transformation that will benefit to everyone . These goals are set to open up new opportunities for businesses, to boost the development of trustworthy technology, foster an open and democratic society, enable a vibrant and sustainable economy, and help fight climate change and achieve the green transition. The strategy of digital economy is included in a wider strategy for the future of Europe. However, as explained on the EC's website, the aim to become a global role model for the digital economy fit within the EU's goals for decades, as it is the aim in the environmental field. However, the EU had to review its aim in this field, and becomes a 'Leadiator'. It is possible that in the Digital Economy, the EU has to behave and evolves in the same way, because the champions of the digital sector aren't European, which creates a handicap in the way the EU refrain from legislating. The EU cannot restrict the offer to its citizens, because digital leader are not mainly Europeans. One objective of the single market is to make available the better quality at the better price, and propose a better choice to its citizens.  Conclusion  As explained earlier, the digital economy is based on computing technologies. More and more business result in the connection around the world. It is referred to as a new type of economy that emerges. The rapid spread of ICT all around the world has led to the development of a new kind of product and services, that changes the way we are doing business today. The Digital Economy represents today 15% of the global world GDP. It is relying on personal data, which has been regulated by the EU's directive of 1995, which had the goal to integrate EU within the Digital market. Digital Single Market has been for long a priority for the EU and has beneficiated of the 2007 crisis as a window of opportunity to act. However, we see how the mandate of the EC is thin, to the heterogeneity of the market, and the fact that the EU has to act ex-post. As a result, Member States lack of coordination. The goals of the Single Market concerning consumers, is to offer a panel of choice at a better price. Yet, the champions of the Digital market aren't Europeans. Due to the network effect, barriers to European businesses that want to enter within the market, the barriers remain even higher. Dominant position harbored by US big tech platforms do not give a wide possibility of manoeuver combined with the volatility of the market.  Critics/debate = Rise of intangible capitalism  The digital economy is also qualified as \\"intangible capitalism\\"f which fosters inequality and social division. In 2017, Haskel and Westlake published ‚Äúcapitalism without capital‚Äù which raises concerns about policymakers‚Äô inability to tailor from the transition of the traditional economy to the New Economy based on intangible assets. From the mid-2000s onwards, companies have been investing more in ‚Äòintangibles‚Äô such as branding, design, and technology than they have in machinery, hardware or property. Businesses such as Uber do not own cars, they own software and data. Coffee bars and gyms rely on branding to help them stand out from the crowd. Pharmaceutical companies have vast budgets for marketing as well as research and development. As opposed to the traditional production where the marginal cost of production decreases after the first unit produced which does not apply to the software. Once the first unit is produced such as data, insurance, e-books, even movies, the rest of the production is virtually free. As the proportion of the world's economy that does not fit the old model keeps getting larger, it has implications for a wide range of policies. The intangibility of assets may widen the gap between small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and multinationals enterprises (MNEs). On the one hand, the current bank system struggles to value and monitor immaterial assets. In the old days, when a company went bankrupt, banks could recover their money by selling the physical assets such as buildings, machinery, etc. Yet, if the intangible assets drop, those assets can not be sold easily as the value of the company goes down. As a result, SMEs are more reliant on venture capital which is different than bank financing. The easier access to resources allow MNEs to benefit from synergies of the intangible assets. For instance, in creating the iPod, Apple combined MP3 technology with licensing agreements, record labels, and design expertise to produce a winning product. This ability to combine technologies and then scale up to help these companies to increase their dominant position on the market.  Exploitation of labour forces  Expansion of Global value chains = The digital economy has accelerated the spread of global value chains in which Multinationals enterprises (MNEs) integrate their worldwide operations. These advances, coupled with liberalization of trade policy and reduction in transportation costs, have expanded the ability of businesses in all sectors to take advantage of global value chains in which production processes can be geographically dispersed in locations around the world to take advantage of the features of local markets. It is easier for firms to implement their activities where there are low wages and to coordinate their activities from countries with high wages. = Bypassing labor laws = The rise of online platforms raises concerns in terms of legal questions about social security and labor law. Since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, there is an increase in 'uberization' of work. As within a company that gives its name to this phenomenon, workers are defined as ‚Äòindependent workers‚Äô (with temporary, off- site, autonomous contracts) which challenges the application of labor and occupational health and safety law. As a result, online platforms encourage the flexibilization of jobs and a higher volatility of the labor market rather than on traditional companies. ‚ÄòGig economy‚Äô companies such as Deliveroo and Uber hire drivers which are self-employed and sign a contract with the digital platform while the way they work is much regular to a regular employee statute. Yet, for the first time in March 2020, France's top court (Cour de Cassation) ruling acknowledged that a Uber driver could not qualify as a ‚Äòself-employed‚Äô contractor because he could not build his clientele or set his prices, establishing a relation of a subordinate of the company. = Intensification of the global competition for human resources = Digital platforms rely on 'deep learning' to scale up their algorithm's capacity. The human-powered content labeling industry is constantly growing as companies seek to harness data for AI training. These practices have raised concerns concerning the low-income revenue and health-related issues of these independent workers. For instance, digital companies such as Facebook or YouTube use ‚Äòcontent monitor‚Äô-contractors who work as outside monitors hired by a professional services company subcontractor- to monitor social media to remove any inappropriate content. Thus, the job consists of watching and listening to disturbing posts that can be violent or sexual. In January 2020, through its subcontractor services society, Facebook and YouTube have asked the ‚Äòcontent moderators‚Äô to sign a PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) disclosure after alleged cases of mental disorders witnessed on workers.

It is the sequel to the 1969 film The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes and was followed by 1975's The Strongest Man in the World. Now You See Him, Now You Don't was the first Disney film to be shown on television in a two- hour time slot, in 1975. Previous television showings of Disney films had either shown them edited or split into two one-hour time slots. Plot At Medfield College, science buff Dexter Riley and his friends, including Richard Schuyler and Debbie Dawson, eavesdrop via a hidden walkie-talkie on a board meeting led by Dean Eugene Higgins, discussing the small college's continuing precarious finances. Later that afternoon, Professor Lufkin shows Higgins around the science lab where Dexter is working on an experiment with invisibility and another student, Druffle, explores the flight of bumblebees. That night, during a powerful thunderstorm, the lab is struck by lightning, resulting in the destruction of Dexter‚Äôs work. The next day, as Dexter examines his burnt equipment with dismay, Higgins meets with A.J. Arno, a recently released prisoner, who had also purchased Medfield's mortgage. When Dexter accidentally drops one half of his glasses into a container of his experimental formula, it appears as if the substance destroys them, but upon closer examination, Dexter realizes the frames are merely partially invisible. After several tests, Dexter places his fingers in the liquid and they disappear. Schuyler and Debbie arrive and are horrified to see Dexter with a partial hand, but Dexter insists Schuyler test the substance as well, admitting only afterward that he does not yet have an antidote. Just then, Higgins brings Arno to visit the lab, stunning the students, as only two years earlier, Dexter was instrumental in exposing Arno's crooked gambling scheme. Dexter and the others notice that Arno is more concerned with the campus architecture than Higgins' speech. Curious about Arno's behavior, Dexter convinces Schuyler to use the invisibility formula to sneak into Arno's office that night. Despite several mishaps, the boys get inside Arno's office where they find a model of Medfield College redesigned as a gambling establishment. After taking photos of the model, the boys flee with Debbie's help. The next day Dexter shows the photos to Lufkin and Higgins. Convinced that Druffle's bumblebee study would draw attention and investments to Medfield, Higgins reacts angrily when Dexter assures him that his invisibility formula could win the top prize money in the upcoming Forsythe science contest. Not having admitted to anyone that Medfield has been dropped from the contest for being too insignificant, Higgins contacts the contest's sponsor, millionaire Timothy Forsythe, and agrees to meet over a game of golf, despite his inability to play. Upon learning of Higgins' plan and suspecting it must be connected with raising money for the college, Dexter urges Schuyler to volunteer to serve as Higgins' caddy while, hidden by the invisibility formula, he will take control of Higgins' golf ball. At the golf club, Forsythe and the state university dean, Collingsgood, are amazed by Higgins' quirky golfing abilities, which include numerous hole-in-one-shots, as is Arno who is also at the club. After the game, Forsythe agrees to reinstate Medfield into the competition. Meanwhile, Arno accidentally sees Dexter becoming visible in the club showers and grows suspicious. When the local television news covers Higgins' extraordinary golf game, he is invited to join an exclusive tournament in nearby Ocean City. Convinced that he will win enough money to pay the college's mortgage, Higgins brashly accepts and that afternoon departs with Schuyler. Learning of the tournament too late, Dexter misses the plane and is forced to watch the competition on television where Higgins' game against two professionals is a disaster. Arno and his henchmen also watch the tournament and ponder Higgins' odd inconsistency. Upon returning to the college, Higgins tells Lufkin that Druffle's bumblebee experiment is the school's last chance. Both men are stunned when Druffle appears swathed in bandages after being attacked by the bumblebees, to which he is allergic. Hoping to assuage the crestfallen Higgins, Lufkin suggests that they give Dexter's unproven formula a chance and the dean reluctantly agrees. That evening, Arno‚Äôs henchman Cookie, disguised as a janitor, sneaks into the campus lab where he witnesses Dexter and Schuyler using the invisibility spray and reports to Arno, who orders him to return and steal it. The following day, Forsythe and members of his committee arrive on campus to judge the best science experiment at the college. Unaware that their spray bottle has been replaced by Cookie, Dexter and Schuyler make their presentation and are stunned when it has no effect. Forsythe and Higgins depart as Dexter remains confused until he chats with Charlie the janitor. Learning that there is no night janitor, Dexter realizes that Cookie likely stole the formula. Concluding that Arno must be behind the theft, Dexter plants a walkie-talkie in his office. A couple of days later, Schuyler overhears Arno plotting with Cookie to rob the Medfield Bank by making themselves and the money invisible. Certain that if he could retrieve the formula before the Forsythe Award announcement that night he could still win the contest, Dexter sends Schuyler to the police and goes to inform the bank's president, Wilfred Sampson. When both the police and Sampson dismiss the boys' story about invisibility, Dexter and his friends gather outside of the bank. When an invisible Arno and Cookie knock out the guards and take the money, Dexter unsuccessfully tries to use a fire hydrant to hose the men down as they exit the bank. Sampson contacts the police, who join the college students in a wild chase of the car driven by the invisible robbers. After a long police chase, Dexter forces Arno's car into a swimming pool where it, the money, and the men become visible. Arno and his henchmen are arrested. Dexter and the others dash to the presentation of the Forsythe Award and plead for one more opportunity to demonstrate their invention. Frustrated by Dexter's determination, Higgins intervenes just as Dexter sprays Schuyler, and, again, there is no result. Realizing the dip in the pool has diluted the formula, Dexter tries to explain to Forsythe. Just when Higgins tells everyone for the last time that invisibility does not exist, the top half of him becomes invisible, thus shocking the group and winning the top prize to save Medfield for another year.

Parts of the chase scenes were done along the main street that goes through the area of the golf courses in Griffith Park.  Props  The green Volkswagen Beetle used by Schuyler was two Herbie cars from The Love Bug: one was the vehicle carried by Tang Wu's Chinese Camp students (this was a gutted car and a rubber truck tire tube was placed under the passenger door, and when inflated suddenly, it would tip the car over, this car used in the scene where A.J. Arno rams it). The other car was used in the scenes with Schuyler driving it on a flat tire (the Art Dept. painted the car green and dusted it to give a look of neglect. When the sunroof is open, the original Herbie pearl white paint job under the tarp sunroof can be seen where the green was not painted). Comics adaptations A text piece with illustrations adapting the film appeared in Walt Disney Comics Digest #37 (Oct. 1972) with a production still on the cover. The Walt Disney's Treasury of Classic Tales comic strip ran an adaptation written by Frank Reilly and drawn by John Uslher that appeared between April 2, 1972 and June 25, 1972. Reception The movie received a mixed reception. A negative review came from The New York Times, which accorded, \\"Now with all due respect to children's intuition and judgment, may we suggest that they now try the Real McCoy, if they haven't already.

It was founded in 1947 by Dr. Rudolf G√∂rike and Ernest Plass in Vienna, Austria. It is a part of Harman International Industries, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics. The products currently marketed under the AKG brand mostly consist of microphones, headphones, wireless audio systems and related accessories for professional and consumer markets. History The company was founded in Vienna, Austria in 1947 by two Viennese: physicist Dr. Rudolf G√∂rike and engineer Ernst Pless. Originally, its main business was to provide technical equipment for cinemas: loudspeakers, film projectors and light meters. The business slowly expanded and AKG started selling car horns, door intercoms, carbon microphone capsules for telephones, headsets and cushion speakers. The first AKG microphone was used by radio stations, theaters, jazz clubs and cabarets. About this time, the company developed its first patents, the moving coil technology and the principle of mass load membranes, allowing its products to have extended frequency ranges.Retrieved April 2, 2014 With the creation of the D12 microphone in 1953, AKG achieved international fame, setting the standard for voice transmissions. Being the world's first dynamic cardioid microphone, it possessed excellent sonic qualities for that time, making its way into radio stations and recording studios from across the world.Retrieved April 2, 2014 The product was improved through subsequent upgrades, spanning the famous C414 and C12 microphones. End of the 70es and in the 80s Magnetic cartridges were produced, in 1982 for example the P 25.HiFi-Stereophonie 11/1982 especially p.4 of PDF (German; PDF, 3,4 MB), retrieved 2020-05-21. In 1984, AKG became a public company, listed on the Vienna stock exchange. As a blue chip company, it was one of the most traded stocks.Retrieved on April 2, 2014 The company was acquired by the American company Harman International Industries in 1994. By this time, AKG's United States subsidiary had been established (in Los Angeles in 1985). AKG Acoustics USA, still headquartered in the San Fernando Valley, also houses regional offices for Crown Audio, another Harman Industries subsidiary. In 2010, the company received the prestigious Technical Grammy award. In 2016 it was announced that the AKG Vienna facilities (headquarters, manufacturing, and engineering) would be shut down in 2017, with a transfer of brand headquarters to California, USA.

Those microphones are equipped with the famous CK12 large diaphragm capsule designed by AKG's engineer Konrad Wolf. The CK12 was a milestone in transducer technology and the first to offer constant frequency response and sensitivity for all polar patterns (omni to figure eight). AKG microphones have been used for shooting Hans Hass's movie Adventures in the Red Sea and were installed on the MIR space station. They are also mentioned by Dan Brown in his novels The Da Vinci Code and Deception Point. Some microphone models include: *D12E - a dynamic cardioid microphone with a bass boost between 60 and 120 Hz utilized for sources with high sound pressure and low-frequency content *D130 - an omnidirectional microphone often used by reporters *D19c - dynamic cardioid mic.

It featured a ground lift switch on the power supply, which can be useful in combating ground loop problems. Standard accessories included a spider type shock mount, pop screen and strong carrying case. Headphones AKG also manufactures a range of high-specification headphones. The K50 model, introduced in 1959 were the world's first supra-aural and open-back headphones. The K1000 was the flagship model, but is no longer being produced. It was a unique fully open headphone. The current flagship model for the AKG headphone line-up is the K812. The K702 features a removable cord and is black, the K701 is white. The Q701 also has a detachable cable and comes in three color variants: white, black, and a lime green. All three models are still in production. The K701s have been largely used by professional musicians and technicians in recording studios. Many top recording studios use AKG K240 headphones as a solution for best general use for both monitor and playback. They received particular notoriety from their prominent display in Eddie Murphy's 1985 music video for \\"Party All the Time\\" (which features the K240 Monitor). Another notable, yet short-lived model was the K280 Parabolic ‚Äì a multi-driver headphone which focused compression waves to a central point in the earcup. As well as studio headphones, AKG also manufactures a range of Hi- Fi headphones and earphones for domestic use. One notable use includes Samsung, their parent company, using AKG to tune their headphones that come equipped with Samsung's most-recent flagship devices, starting with the Galaxy S8 and S8+, the stereo speakers as of the Galaxy S9, S9+, S10E, S10+, Note 9, and the Note 10 (USB Type-C connector). In 2017, the Y50 model was awarded Product of the Year for on-ear headphones by What Hi-Fi? magazine.

King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, then ruler of the Upper Lusatian lands, ceded it to the Meissen bishop Conrad I of Wallhausen. The fortress probably lost its strategic importance with the construction of Czocha Castle further east in the early 14th century. Church of Christ the King The Lissa settlement is documented in 1329. It may have been a founding of the Silesian Duke Henry I of Jawor, heir of the Upper Lusatian Kwisa District by his mother Beatrice of Brandenburg. Upon Henry's death in 1346, the Kwisa lands reverted to the Bohemian Crown, whereafter the lordship was enfeoffed to local noble dynasties. A first town layout was abandoned in 1434 upon devastations by the Hussite Wars, a flood and a fire, and rebuilt at its present location further south on the route from Fr√Ωdlant to Luba≈Ñ. A centre of cloth manufacturing, it received market rights in 1515. The name Marklissa first appeared in 1574. Upon the 1635 Peace of Prague it fell with Upper Lusatia to the Electorate of Saxony. The town's economy was boosted by the immigration of Protestants fleeing from the Counter-Reformation in the adjacent Habsburg lands of Bohemia and Silesia. After the Napoleonic Wars and the 1815 Congress of Vienna, southeastern Upper Lusatia was annexed by Prussia and incorporated into the Province of Silesia. With Prussia Marklissa became part of the German Empire in 1871. After World War II the town, located east of the Oder-Neisse line, was ceded to the Republic of Poland according to the 1945 Potsdam Agreement. The German population was expelled and the area resettled with Poles deported from the eastern Kresy borderlands. Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities See twin towns of Gmina Le≈õna.

Identification = Species description  This crustacean has a hard rounded-triangular shell, or carapace, that is covered in hair-like projections that vary in size. The shell's length is 1.3 times the size of its width, the shell's surface has many tubercles with spines running to the front of the shell going to the sides. The edges of the carapace have nine outward directed sharp spines: 3 supraorbital, 3 hepatic and 3 brachial. Two spines at the front of the crab's head form a V-shape and are covered with small bristles. Some of the bristles along the carapace are short and hooked while others are long and straight. The abdomen has seven segments in both sexes with the male abdomen being more narrowwith the segments being broader than longer. The legs are longest in the front and get progressively shorter towards the back. It has three pairs of walking legs, a pair of swimming legs in the back, and a pair of claws at the front called chelipeds. The walking legs are long and slender with the back of the legs covered in a longitudinal row of short hooked bristles including long straight bristles. The pincers are orange or red with white tips, and the legs have brown hairs. As a decorator crab, this crab attaches seaweed or algae from its environment to the hooked hairs on its body, which gives this crab camouflage along the ocean floor. Hairy seaweed crabs change their camouflage with 10-20% of the cover being replaced each day, this causes their movement to be very sluggish like many other spider crabs.  Distribution and habitat = Natural global range  The seaweed crab is antipodean as it is native to New Zealand and south-east Australia.  New Zealand range  The seaweed crab is broadly dispersed across New Zealand shorelines on both the North and South Islands. It is also found on the Stewart and Chatham Islands.  Habitat preferences  The seaweed crab can be found along the coast amid rocks in tide pools and the intertidal zone. Its bathymetric range extends to 75 meters, meaning that it can be found in waters up to this depth, but it is mostly found in shallow waters. Crabs living in deeper waters usually do not show any masking behaviour. It is negatively phototactic, which means it moves away from light. For this reason, it often buries itself in the sand or hides among seaweed.  Life cycle/Phenology  The female seaweed crab lays fertilized eggs from which larvae develop and break free. The eggs are bright orange when freshly laid and turn brown as they approach time to hatch, and are approximately 0.75mm across. There are multiple stages of the larva before they reach maturity including pre-zoea, zoea 1, zoea 2, and megalopa. When the larva hatches it is enclosed in a thin and transparent covering that is shed shortly after. Then this comes the first zoea stage during which the larva is about 3.0mm. Zoea 1 lasts 8‚Äì16 days before the exoskeleton of the larva is shed and it enters zoea 2. At zoea 2 the larva is about 3.5mm long. The larva transforms into megalopa after 12‚Äì15 days at a temperature of 16 degrees Celsius. After 20 days, the megalopa larva moults into a juvenile crab. They shed their shells every few months in order to grow, and will grow faster if they live in warmer water. Seaweed crabs typically grow to 5 cm across and live for approximately two years. Diet and foraging= Diet  Crabs are typically scavengers, meaning that they eat whatever they can find, and as omnivores this includes both plants and other animals. In a study conducted on seaweed crabs living on the coast of the South Island of New Zealand, the foreguts were opened among a sample of crabs to determine what foods had been consumed. Algae, including calcareous red algae and branched brown algae, was identified as the most commonly eaten substance, as it was found in nearly all of the crabs sampled. Other common foods included isopods, amphipods, and decapods (e.g. small fish, crayfish, other crabs). Bivalves, sponges, bryozans, and more were consumed as well but not commonly. Meat consumed is usually from dead animals because seaweed crabs are slow moving and not very strong. The guts of female crabs contained more brown non-branched algae and unknown substances than male crabs, although there was no apparent difference in the amount or variation of food consumed. Types of foods consumed also varied by the size of the crab. Smaller male crabs ate more gastropods, isopods, and amphipods, while larger males ate more algae and decapods. Similarly, smaller female crabs ate more isopods and larger females ate more algae. These differences are likely due to the impact of size on the crab's ability to process foods. Both soft-bodied and hard-bodied animals were consumed, as well as a wide range of algae. Seaweed crabs use their claws to tear apart their food, and predation techniques vary based on the mobility of the prey. Larger mature crabs have a greater ability to process foods because they have more powerful claws and larger mouths. There is also evidence that the species of algae that the seaweed crab attaches to its body are preferred species for consumption as well, so the masking behavior of these crabs serves as food storage. The crab can eat up to 4.1% of the algae masking them when there is no food available to consume. The types of algae for masking may also be chosen based on ‚Äúcalorific value or content of vitamins, nitrogen, or specific nutrients such as sugars and amino acids‚Äù.  Foraging  N. ursus uses its chelipeds to execute a wide variety of feeding techniques that it uses on those different types of prey. They can be used to pull off chitons and limpets from rocks, or open bivalves and gastropods. Small arthropods, juvenile crayfish and polychaetes were obtained by probing around with opened chalae and quickly closing them when they contacted the prey. Chelipeds are also used to tear prey into smaller pieces. E.g. brittlestar is rotated using the chelipeds to tear of the arm. Also, ‚Äògravel-scrubbing‚Äô is used to feed on detritus and micro-organisms. For this feeding technique, N. ursus uses a cheliped to pick up pieces of gravel and move them along the inner mouthpart, thereby taking particles from the gravel.  Predation  Seaweed crabs require camouflage because they are unable to defend themselves from other sea animals, such as sea otters, sea turtles, lobsters, rock crabs, and octopuses. Other fish may eat smaller crabs as well if they have strong enough jaws. Studies have shown a significant decrease in the predation experienced by decorated seaweed crabs compared to ones that had been cleaned. These crabs may also avoid predators more because they are nocturnal. Sometimes seaweed crabs will hide themselves amongst sponges that may serve as a level of protection because of the neurotoxins they have.  Other information  A study conducted by Chris Woods in 1995 examined the foregut morphology of seaweed crabs, shedding light on the digestive system of the understudied spider crab. Brachyura have the most highly developed gut systems of decapod crustaceans. Seaweed crabs have adapted to a macrophagous diet, in other words eating large foods. They have teeth to break down the material they consume and setae, hair-like structures, to aid in the process. Cuspidate setae help to hold the food as it is torn apart to be ground into smaller pieces. Serrate setae serve as chemoreceptors or filters to separate out particles during digestion so that digested liquid is more easily absorbed. Plumodenticulate setae also help to filter and move particles along, but could serve to close gaps to keep out unwanted particles. Pappose setae might perform a range of functions such as chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, gap sealants, or scrapers. As mentioned in the diet section, decorating behavior of seaweed crabs is thought to be a method of food storage in addition to camouflage. A study conducted by Woods and McLay (1994) explores this decorating behavior more in depth. Their study revealed that these crabs consume their camouflage materials most often when food is scarce but that it is still important as a food store during other times because they eat it even when other food sources are present. Feeding on their decorative algae also occurs mostly at night and is taken from their bodies rather than their legs. Both behaviors contribute to the maintenance of camouflage.

The song was written and sung by guitarist Dickey Betts, who penned it about his girlfriend (and later wife), Sandy \\"Bluesky\\" Wabegijig. The track is also notable as one of guitarist Duane Allman's final recorded performances with the group. The band's two guitarists, Duane Allman and Dickey Betts, alternate playing the song's lead: Allman's solo beginning 1:07 in, Betts joining in a shared melody line at 2:28, followed by Betts's solo at 2:37. The song is notably more country-inspired than many songs in the band's catalogue. Background His debut as a vocalist for the band, Dickey Betts composed \\"Blue Sky\\" about his Native Canadian girlfriend, Sandy \\"Bluesky\\" Wabegijig, whom he would later marry. The lyrics leave out any references to gender to make it nonspecific: \\"Once I got into the song I realized how nice it would be to keep the vernaculars‚Äîhe and she‚Äîout and make it like you‚Äôre thinking of the spirit, like I was giving thanks for a beautiful day. I think that made it broader and more relatable to anyone and everyone,\\" he later said. Betts initially wanted the band's lead vocalist, Gregg Allman, to sing the song, but guitarist Duane Allman encouraged him to sing it himself: \\"Man, this is your song and it sounds like you and you need to sing it.\\" An embryonic version of the song can be found on the fan bootleg, The Gatlinburg Tapes, a recording of the band jamming in April 1971 in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The song was one of Duane Allman's last recorded performances with the band. \\"As I mixed songs like \\"Blue Sky,\\" I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's not going to be any more from him,\\" said Johnny Sandlin. Alternate versions While Duane Allman died before Eat a Peach's release, the Band played the song live several times before and after the album's studio version was recorded. Only one of these performances, recorded live during a September 19, 1971, concert at S.U.N.Y. Stonybrook, has been released by the band; several bootleg recordings from other shows circulate. Two versions of \\"Blue Sky\\" were being performed as of 2012: An Allman Brothers take on the SUNY Stony Brook/Eat a Peach original (with Warren Haynes on lead vocals, though Gregg Allman does them sometimes), and an arrangement which evolved between 1973 and 2001 played by Dickey Betts and his band Great Southern.

The present square, largely occupied by the through traffic to and from Munkbroleden and Vasabron, and surrounded by old palaces occupied by modestly extrovert state-level offices, is the faint remains of what used to be the centre of Swedish politics; the palace of the Swedish nobility standing face-to-face with the emergent Liberal press, the entire scene using the idyllic eastern canal as a backdrop. History Riddarhustorget in the 18th century. Riddarhustorget in 1885. A product of the redesign of the western parts of the city in the early-17th century, the square first appears in historical records as Riddare huuss platzen (\\"Knight's House Space\\", 1641), and Riddarehuus Torget (1662). In 1765, the nobility decided to transfer the southern premises of their lot to the city for the enlargement of the open space in front of the palace, and had the statue of King Gustav Vasa placed in the middle of it. When the square was redesigned in 1914‚Äì1916, the statue was moved to its present location immediately in front of the palace. Increasing traffic loads during the early-20th century, resulted in over 20 proposals for a long bridge passing through central Stockholm over Gamla stan. Discussions in 1930 ending up in a temporary solution, by its customers dubbed Slingerbultsleden (\\"Dodge Route\\"), leading the north-bound through traffic around Riddarhustorget by means of two bridges to and from Riddarholmen. By the end of the 1950s, the southern bridge of the present more permanent solution Centralbron was completed, a few years later accompanied by its northern extension. Setting On the western side of the square is a scenic view of the bridge Riddarholmsbron stretching over Riddarholmskanalen and the motorway Centralbron to the islet Riddarholmen and some prominent buildings there, including Riddarholmskyrkan and a few of the palaces. On the eastern side, the street Myntgatan passes between the arcades of two of the buildings of the Parliament, Kanslihuset (\\"Chancellery House\\") and Kanslihusannexet (\\"Annex of the Chancellery House\\") over to Mynttorget. On the southern side of Riddarhustorget, the alley Storkyrkobrinken leads up to the Stockholm Cathedral and the Royal Palace, while the street Stora Nygatan passes through the western part of the old town and Munkbroleden leads along the western waterfront past the neighbouring square Munkbron. North of the square the alleys R√•dhusgr√§nd and Riddarhusgr√§nd connects to the cast iron bridge Vasabron from the 1870s. Several prominent palaces are located around Riddarhustorget: House of Knights Riddarhuset, southern front. Occupying the northern side of the square and still dominating its environment is the House of Knights (Riddarhuset), a Swedish equivalent to the British House of Lords. While the building was begun by the French-born architect Simon de la Vall√©e in 1641 (a year before his dramatic death), the fa√ßade is largely the work of the Dutch architect Justus Vingboons (1620‚Äì1698) in 1652-1656, and the original roof the design of the son of the former Jean de la Vall√©e (1620‚Äì1696) in 1656-1674, the entire composition completed by Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz (1716‚Äì1796) in 1762. The entire composition reflects the decreasing influence of Swedish nobility during the transition from the era of Swedish Empire to the Age of Liberty; the original intentions, including towers on the corners and wings, reduced to the present Corinthian pilasters projected on a plain bricked wall, centred on the temple gable motif. Before the small garden in front of the palace was created to the design of Isak Gustaf Clason (1856‚Äì1930) in the 1910s, Riddarhuset formed the scenic background for what was the country's political centre. In front of the building stands the statue of King Gustav Vasa. Bonde Palace The Bonde Palace East of the House of Knights is the Bonde Palace (Bondeska palatset), arguably the most prominent monument of the era of Swedish Empire. It was originally created as the private residence of Gustaf Bonde (1620‚Äì1667) in the 1660s to the design by Jean de la Vall√©e and Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, however overtaken by the city in the early 18th century to serve as a city hall until the early 20th century and since WW2 accommodating the Supreme Court. The Ionic pilasters of the main building still reflects the original design, while the top floor and roof are from the 17th century. The building has been destroyed by fire on several occasions and was much neglected during the 18th and early 19th centuries, but post-WW2 restorations have been focused on giving prominence to the oldest features of the building, today given the status as an historical monument of national interest. Ryning Palace Ryning Palace at Riddarhustorget The Ryning Palace (Ryningska palatset), located south of the square, was begun by the capable Erik Ryning in the 1640s to the design of Simon de la Vall√©e. The architect died within a year of starting so large parts of the palace were not completed until 1770, many years after the death of the original proprietor and in an apparently different style to the older parts. The new proprietor Gottfried Sackenhielm used part of his palace to run a tavern and a brothel that was frequently visited by many notable men of the era, including the still popular troubadour Carl Michael Bellman. Following the death of Sackenhielm, the property was taken over by Johan Bergstrahl, who, except giving parts of the block their present names, raised the activities in the buildings to an unprecedented level, introducing social clubs, newspapers and caf√©'s. Today the building is occupied by the Supreme Court and the Labour Court.

The majority of the population lives in rural areas. In isolated areas there still remains a handful of the giant communal structures that previously housed the whole male population, with a circling cluster of huts for the women. The Papuan people are Melanesian people composed of at least 240 different peoples, each with its own language and culture. Sago is the staple food of the Papuan supplemented with hunting, fishing and small gardens. Papuans may be related to the Iatmul on the Sepik River and to the Asmat and Marind-anim farther west along the coast. There the cultures share concepts of village ‚Äúbig men‚Äù, great longhouses, huge dugout canoes, headhunting and, in some areas, cannibalism. Ancestors are important, but not necessarily revered in Papuan culture. The important quality is called ‚Äúimunu‚Äù, the power that pervades things, including ritual objects. Imunu is personified in the masked ceremonies. Most representations are of humans or ancestors, not plants or animals. Traditional cultural ceremonies on a large scale existed into the 1950s, but declined as Christian missionaries converted the villages. Religion The Christian church has been extraordinarily influential. Most Papuan people regard themselves as Christians. The largest denominations are Catholic, Evangelical Lutheran and United Church. Pantheistic beliefs are also widespread and traditional rituals are important in Papuan culture. For example, people who live in danger of crocodile attacks are likely to give crocodiles an important role in their culture, while farming communities often place greater emphasis on the weather, accordingly celebrating fertility and harvest. Placating the spirits of ancestors is a dominant theme in traditional beliefs while the fear of sorcery and witchcraft is also widespread. Most Papuans manage to create a personal theology that seemingly blends Christianity with the finer points of their traditional religion. Art Papuan art forms are as diverse as they are distinctive. In a country where language varies from village to village, it can be expected that artistic expression will differ in style just as dramatically. Pottery, weapons, carvings, basketwork and musical instruments are produced by different people in different places, according to their traditional skills and beliefs. Most provinces specialize in different kinds of weaponry. Bows and arrows are traditional in several areas. Shields have a decorative and spiritual role just as important as their defensive purposes. Gope boards are believed to possess the spirits of powerful warriors or to act as guardians of the village. Before hunting or war expeditions, the spirits were called upon to advise and protect the men. Story boards are a modern version of the fragile bark carvings villagers used to make. The boards illustrate incidents of village life in raised relief.

As of 2019, the town has a population of 4,828.

In the 18th century a mineral spa was founded in the Jedlinka estate. It was named Charlottenbrunn by its founder in honour of his wife Charlotte von Seherr-Thossa. In 1737 a spa house and other buildings were built. Later on, the village became a centre of textile trade. Four fairs a year took place here. In 1742 the settlement was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1768 it was granted town rights. In the 19th century the spa town often changed its owners, which slowed its development.. In the interwar period there were six hotels and about 30 pensions in the town. During World War II, in 1944, the Germans established a labor camp, which was a branch of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, in the town. After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II the town became once again part of Poland and was renamed Jedlina-Zdr√≥j. The suffix \\"Zdr√≥j\\" is typical for names of spa towns in Poland.

Unlike the inland and less heavily travelled Nakasend≈ç, the T≈çkaid≈ç travelled along the sea coast of eastern Honsh≈´, hence the route's name. Traveling the T≈çkaid≈ç The standard method of travel was by foot, as wheeled carts were almost nonexistent and heavy cargo was usually sent by boat. Members of the higher class, however, travelled by kago. Women were forbidden to travel alone and had to be accompanied by men. Other restrictions were also put in place for travellers, but, while severe penalties existed for various travel regulations, most seem not to have been enforced. T≈çkaid≈ç, photographed by Felice Beato in 1865. Along the T≈çkaid≈ç, there were government-sanctioned post stations (shukuba) for travellers' rest. These stations consisted of porter stations and horse stables, as well as lodging, food and other places a traveller may visit. The original T≈çkaid≈ç was made up of 53 stations between the termination points of Edo and Kyoto. The 53 stations were taken from the 53 Buddhist saints that Buddhist acolyte Sudhana visited to receive teachings in his quest for enlightenment. The route passed through several provinces, each administered by a daimy≈ç, the borders of whose regions were clearly delineated. At numerous checkpoints set up by the government, travellers had to present travelling permits in order to pass onward. There were almost no bridges over the larger, fast-flowing rivers, forcing travelers to be ferried across by boat or be carried by watermen porters. Additionally, at one point in Nagoya the road was barred by several rivers and voyagers had to take a boat across the sea for 17 miles to reach Kuwana station. These water crossings were a potential source of delay: In ideal weather the entire T≈çkaid≈ç journey on foot could be made in about a week, but if conditions were bad a trip might take up to a month. The T≈çkaid≈ç in art and literature Nissaka-shuku, the 25th station on the T≈çkaid≈ç, as illustrated by the ukiyo-e master Hiroshige. This print is from the first (Hoeiko) edition of The Fifty-three Stations of the T≈çkaid≈ç. Travel, particularly along the T≈çkaid≈ç, was a very popular topic in art and literature at the time. A great many guidebooks of famous places were published and distributed at this time, and a culture of virtual tourism through books and pictures thrived. Jippensha Ikku's T≈çkaid≈çch≈´ Hizakurige, translated as \\"The Shank's Mare\\", is one of the more famous novels about a journey along the T≈çkaid≈ç. The artist Hiroshige depicted each of the 53 Stations of the T≈çkaid≈ç (shukuba) in his work The Fifty-three Stations of the T≈çkaid≈ç, and the haiku poet Matsuo Bash≈ç travelled along the road.Forbes, Andrew; Henley, David (2014).

The T≈çkaid≈ç goj≈´san tsui (Fifty-Three Pairings along the T≈çkaid≈ç Road), created in 1845, is one of the most well- known and fascinating examples of woodblock prints inspired by the road. Japan's three leading print designers of the nineteenth century‚ÄîKuniyoshi, Hiroshige, and Kunisada‚Äîpaired each T≈çkaid≈ç rest station with an intriguing, cryptic design. Nissaka Station, Utagawa Kuniyoshi, T≈çkaid≈ç goj≈´san tsui . Collection Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art (2005.25.7.26) Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art Due to the harsh and punitive Tenp≈ç-era reforms which attempted to impose a strictly defined morality, prints of celebrity actors, courtesans, and entertainers were outlawed during this time. Crafted to outwit the artistic restrictions imposed by the reforms, the woodcuts in the Parallel Series became popular visual puzzles that were frequently reproduced. Because of the ingenious approach to the T≈çkaid≈ç theme, the T≈çkaid≈ç goj≈´san tsui has been praised as one of the most innovative and important works from the late Edo period. Its three designers followed their individual interests and strengths, and yet shared a common composition‚Äîdominant figures against distant landscapes. They used a variety of motifs, including stories from kabuki theater, poetry, famous tales, legends, landmarks, and local specialties. In the early 1980s, inspired by Hiroshige, American artist Bill Zacha travelled the Tokaido stations. He created a series of 55 serigraphs, each depicting one stop along the Tokaido way, and printed 100 copies of each design. These were collected in the 1985 book Tokaido Journey, along with Bill's recollections (in both English and Japanese) of travelling the road and the people he encountered.. The British painter Nigel Caple travelled along the T≈çkaid≈ç Road between 1998 and 2000, making drawings of the 53 stations along the T≈çkaid≈ç. His inspiration was the Hoeido Edition of woodblock prints entitled The Fifty-three Stations of the T≈çkaid≈ç by Utagawa Hiroshige. These drawings by Nigel Caple formed the basis for a series of paintings and culminated in a touring exhibition and lectures during 2001 and 2002. Locations included Hertfordshire University and The British Museum. The exhibition was part of the UK‚Äôs Japan Festival 2001.Exhibition catalogue, The 53 Stations of the Tokaido Road Paintings by Nigel Caple, edited by Matthew Shaul, published by UH Galleries (University of Hertfordshire Galleries), 2001. .

The video game T≈çkaid≈ç Goj≈´san-tsugi, released by Sunsoft for the Famicom in July 1986 and later ported to other Nintendo platforms, features a firework maker protagonist who must travel the T≈çkaid≈ç to visit his fiancee, while thwarting attacks from a rival businessman. ≈åsaka Kaid≈ç In 1619, the ≈åsaka Kaid≈ç (Â§ßÈò™Ë°óÈÅì) was established as a spur of the T≈çkaid≈ç; it had four stations of its own after ≈åtsu-juku.

In 2011, Solomon joined the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she serves as the Ellen Swallow Richards Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry & Climate Science. Solomon, with her colleagues, was the first to propose the chlorofluorocarbon free radical reaction mechanism that is the cause of the Antarctic ozone hole. Solomon is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the European Academy of Sciences, and the French Academy of Sciences. In 2002, Discover magazine recognized her as one of the 50 most important women in science. In 2008, Solomon was selected by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\\"The 2008 TIME 100\\", Time. She also serves on the Science and Security Board for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Biography left Early life Solomon's interest in science began as a child watching The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau. In high school she placed third in a national science fair, with a project that measured the percent of oxygen in a gas mixture. Solomon received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Illinois Institute of Technology in 1977. She received her Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1981, where she specialized in atmospheric chemistry. Personal life Solomon married Barry Sidwell in 1988. Work Solomon was the head of the Chemistry and Climate Processes Group of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Chemical Sciences Division until 2011. In 2011, she joined the faculty of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. =Books= * The Coldest March: Scott's Fatal Antarctic Expedition, Yale University Press, 2002 ‚Äì Depicts the tale of Captain Robert Falcon Scott's failed 1912 Antarctic expedition, specifically applying the comparison of modern meteorological data with that recorded by Scott's expedition in an attempt to shed new light on the reasons for the demise of Scott's polar party. * Aeronomy of the Middle Atmosphere: Chemistry and Physics of the Stratosphere and Mesosphere, 3rd Edition, Springer, 2005 ‚Äì Describes the atmospheric chemistry and physics of the middle atmosphere from altitude. =The Ozone Hole= Susan Solomon at the Crafoord Prize ceremony in Stockholm 2018 Solomon, working with colleagues at the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, postulated the mechanism that the Antarctic ozone hole was created by a heterogeneous reaction of ozone and chlorofluorocarbons free radicals on the surface of ice particles in the high altitude clouds that form over Antarctica. In 1986 and 1987 Solomon led the National Ozone Expedition to McMurdo Sound, where the team gathered the evidence to confirm the accelerated reactions. Solomon was the solo leader of the expedition, and the only woman on the team. Her team measured levels of chlorine oxide 100 times higher than expected in the atmosphere, which had been released by the decomposition of chlorofluorocarbons by ultraviolet radiation. Solomon later showed that volcanoes could accelerate the reactions caused by chlorofluorocarbons, and so increase the damage to the ozone layer. Her work formed the basis of the U.N. Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to protect the ozone layer by regulating damaging chemicals. Solomon has also presented some research which suggests that implementation of the Montreal Protocols is having a positive effect. Using research work conducted by English explorer and navy officer Robert Falcon Scott, Solomon also wrote and spoke about Scott's 1911 expedition in The Coldest March: Scott's Fatal Antarctic Expedition to counter a longstanding argument that blamed Scott for his and his crew's demise during that expedition. Scott attributed his death to unforeseen weather conditions ‚Äì a claim that has been contested by British journalist and author Roland Huntford. Huntford claimed that Scott was a prideful and under-prepared leader. Solomon has defended Scott and said that \\"modern data side squarely with Scott\\", describing the weather conditions in 1911 as unusual. =Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change= Solomon served the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

It is needed for the import of iron into the cell and is regulated in response to intracellular iron concentration. It imports iron by internalizing the transferrin-iron complex through receptor-mediated endocytosis.; Figure 3: The cycle of transferrin and transferrin receptor 1-mediated cellular iron uptake. The existence of a receptor for transferrin iron uptake had been recognized over half a century back. Earlier two transferrin receptors in humans, transferrin receptor 1 and transferrin receptor 2 had been characterized and until recently cellular iron uptake was believed to occur chiefly via these two well documented transferrin receptors. Both these receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins. TfR1 is a high affinity ubiquitously expressed receptor while expression of TfR2 is restricted to certain cell types and is unaffected by intracellular iron concentrations. TfR2 binds to transferrin with a 25-30 fold lower affinity than TfR1. Although TfR1 mediated iron uptake is the major pathway for iron acquisition by most cells and especially developing erythrocytes, several studies have indicated that the uptake mechanism varies depending upon the cell type. It is also reported that Tf uptake exists independent of these TfRs although the mechanisms are not well characterized. The multifunctional glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH,EC 1.2.1.12) has been shown to utilize post translational modifications to exhibit higher order moonlighting behavior wherein it switches its function as a holo or apo transferrin receptor leading to either iron delivery or iron export respectively. Post-transcriptional regulation Low iron concentrations promote increased levels of transferrin receptor, to increase iron intake into the cell. Thus, transferrin receptor maintains cellular iron homeostasis. TfR production in the cell is regulated according to iron levels by iron-responsive element-binding proteins, IRP1 and IRP2. In the absence of iron, one of these proteins (generally IRP2) binds to the hairpin like structure (IRE) that is in the 3' UTR of the TfR mRNA. Once binding occurs, the mRNA is stabilized and degradation is inhibited.

The use of slavery expanded in the mid-nineteenth century as White American settlers, primarily from the Southeastern United States, crossed the Mississippi River and brought slaves with them. Slavery was present in Spanish America and Mexico prior to the arrival of American settlers, but it was not highly developed, and the Spanish did not rely on it for labor during their years in Spanish Texas. The issue of slavery became a source of contention between the Anglo-American (called that because they spoke English) settlers and Spanish governors. The governors feared the growth in the Anglo-American population in Texas, and for various reasons, by the early 19th century, they and their superiors in Mexico City disapproved of expanding slavery. In 1829 the Guerrero decree conditionally abolished slavery throughout Mexican territories. It was a decision that increased tensions with slave-holders among the Anglo-Americans. After the Texas Revolution ended in 1836, the Constitution of the Republic of Texas made slavery legal. The General Provisions of the Constitution forbade any slave owner from freeing his slaves without the consent of Congress and forbade Congress from making any law that restricted the slave trade or emancipated slaves. Americans of European extraction and slaves contributed greatly to the population growth in the Republic and State of Texas. Settlements grew and developed more land under cultivation in cotton and other commodities. The cotton industry flourished in East Texas, where enslaved labor became most widely used. The central part of the state was dominated by subsistence farmers. Free and runaway blacks had great difficulty finding jobs in Texas. Many worked in other parts of the state as cowboys herding cattle or migrated for better opportunities in the Midwest, California, or southward to Mexico. Early slavery The first non- Native slave in Texas was Estevanico, a Moor from North Africa who had been captured and enslaved by the Spanish when he was a child.Williams (1997), p. 1. Estevanico accompanied his master Captain Andr√©s Dorantes de Carranza on the Narv√°ez expedition, which landed at present-day Tampa. Trying to get around the Gulf Coast, they built five barges, but in November 1528 these went aground off the coast of Texas.Barr (1996), p. 1. Estevanico, Dorantes, and Alonso Castillo Maldonado, the only survivors, spent several months living on a barrier island (now believed to be Galveston Island) before making their way in April 1529 to the mainland.Donald E. Chipman, \\"Estevanico\\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed 13 Aug 2009 American Indians captured and enslaved the party, putting them to work as laborers. They survived with the help of Castillo's faith healing among the Indians. Later they were joined by √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca. Five years later, in September 1534, they escaped to the interior. Although Estevanico was still enslaved, after these events the Spaniards treated him more as an equal. Later he was given leadership of a Spanish expedition.Barr (1996), p. 2. His account, along with those of the others, led to more extensive Spanish exploration of the new territory.Williams (1997), p. 2. Slavery in colonial times Both the civil and religious authorities in Spanish Texas officially encouraged freeing slaves, but the laws were often ignored.Barr (1996), p. 5. Beginning in the 1740s in the Southwest, when Spanish settlers captured American Indian children, they often had them baptized and \\"adopted\\" into the homes of townspeople. There they were raised to be servants. At first the practice involved primarily Apaches; eventually Comanche children were likewise adopted as servants. Importation of enslaved Africans was not widespread in Spanish Texas. In 1751, after three Frenchmen were found to have settled along the Trinity River to trade with the American Indians, the Spanish arrested and expelled them from the colony.Barr (1996), p. 13. A 1777 census of San Antonio showed a total of 2,060 people, with 151 of African descent.Williams (1997), p. 4. Of these, only 15 were slaves, 4 male and 11 females.de la Teja (1956), p. 123. The 1783 census for all of Texas listed a total of 36 slaves. There was intermarriage among blacks, Indians and Europeans. In 1792 there were 34 blacks and 414 mulattos in Spanish Texas, some of whom were free men and women. This was 15 percent of the total 2,992 people living in Spanish Texas.Douglas Hales, \\"Free Blacks\\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed 12 Aug 2009 When the United States purchased Louisiana in 1803, Spain declared that any slave who crossed the Sabine River into Texas would be automatically freed. For a time, many slaves ran away to Texas. Free blacks also emigrated to Texas. Most escaped slaves joined friendly American Indian tribes, but others settled in the East Texas forests. When some French and Spanish slaveholders moved to Texas, they were allowed to retain their slaves.Barr (1996), p. 14. In 1809, the Commandant General of the Interior Provinces, Nemesio Salcedo, ordered the Texas-Louisiana border to be closed to everyone, regardless of ethnic background.Almar√°z, p. 35. His nephew, governor of Texas Manuel Mar√≠a de Salcedo, interpreted the order as allowing slaveholders from the United States to enter Texas to reclaim runaway slaves.Almar√°z, p. 29. The United States outlawed the importation of slaves in 1808, but domestic trade flourished, especially in New Orleans during the antebellum decades. In part due to the slave trade, New Orleans was the fourth largest city in the US in 1840 and one of the wealthiest. Between 1816 and 1821, Louis-Michel Aury and Jean Lafitte smuggled slaves into the United States through Galveston Island.Barr (1996), p. 14. To encourage citizens to report unlawful activity, most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction. The men sold slaves to James Bowie and others, who brought the slaves directly to a customhouse and informed on themselves. The customs officers offered the slaves for auction, and Bowie would buy them back. Due to the state laws, he would receive half of the price he had paid. After that, he could legally transport the slaves and sell them in New Orleans or areas further up the Mississippi River.Hopewell (1994), p. 19.Edmondson (2000), p. 91. Mexican Texas In 1821 at the conclusion of the Mexican War of Independence, Texas was included in the new nation.Chipman (1992), p. 239 That year, the American Stephen F. Austin was granted permission to bring Anglo settlers into Texas.Williams (1997), p. 6. Most of the settlers Austin recruited came from the southern slave-owning portions of the United States. Under Austin's development scheme, each settler was allowed to purchase an additional of land for each slave he brought to the territory. At the same time, however, Mexico offered full citizenship to free blacks, including land ownership and other privileges. The province continued to attract free blacks and escaped slaves from the Southern United States. Favorable conditions for free blacks continued into the 1830s. In 1823, Mexico forbade the sale or purchase of slaves, and required that the children of slaves be freed when they reached age fourteen. By 1825, however, a census of Austin's Colony showed 1,347 Anglo-Americans and 443 people of African descent, including a small number of free blacks. In 1827, the legislature of Coahuila y Tejas outlawed the introduction of additional slaves and granted freedom at birth to all children born to a slave. In 1829 Mexico abolished slavery, but it granted an exception until 1830 to Texas. That year Mexico made the importation of slaves illegal. Anglo-American immigration to the province slowed at this point, with settlers angry about the changing rules. To circumvent the law, numerous Anglo-American colonists converted their slaves to indentured servants, but with life terms. Others simply called their slaves indentured servants without legally changing their status.Barr (1996), p. 15. Slaveholders trying to enter Mexico would force their slaves to sign contracts claiming that the slaves owed money and would work to pay the debt. The low wages the slave would receive made repayment impossible, and the debt would be inherited, even though no slave would receive wages until age eighteen.Vazquez (1997), p. 57. In 1832 the state passed legislation prohibiting worker contracts from lasting more than ten years.Vazquez (1997), p. 63. Many slaves who escaped from masters in Texas or in the United States joined various East Texas Indian tribes. Although not considered equals in the tribes, they were generally treated well. Many former slaves fought with the Cherokee against the Texan army that drove the tribe from East Texas in 1838.Barr (1996), p. 28. Slaves often fought against the Comanche tribe, however. The Comanche indiscriminately killed slaves and their white masters during raids. The Comanche sold any captured slaves to the Cherokee and Creek in Indian Territory, as they were both slave-holding tribes.Barr (1996), p. 29. By the 1800s, most slaves in Texas had been brought by slaveholders from the United States. A small number of slaves were imported illegally from the West Indies or Africa. In the 1830s, the British consul estimated that approximately 500 slaves had been illegally imported into Texas.Barr (1996), p. 16. By 1836, there were approximately 5,000 slaves in Texas.Barr (1996), p. 17. Exportation in the slave-owning areas of the state surpassed that of the non-slave-owning areas. A survey of Texas in 1834 found that the department of Bexar, which was mostly made up of Tejanos, had exported no goods. The Brazos department, including Austin's colonies and those of Green DeWitt, had exported 600,000 pesos worth of goods, including 5,000 bales of cotton.de la Teja (1997), p. 91. The department of Texas, which included the eastern settlements, expected to export 2,000 bales of cotton and 5,000 head of cattle.de la Teja (1997), p. 92. The abolition of slavery created tensions between the Mexican government and slave-holding settlers from the United States. These tensions came to a head in the Anahuac Disturbances. In August 1831, Juan Davis Bradburn, the military commander of the custom station on Upper Galveston Bay, gave asylum to two men who had escaped from slavery in Louisiana. The slave owner hired William Barret Travis, a local lawyer, in an attempt to retrieve the men. When Bradburn arrested Travis on suspicion of plotting an insurrection, settlers rebelled. The disturbances were resolved through a combination of arms and political maneuvering. One result was the Turtle Bayou Resolutions, which were an explanation of the grievances that had led to the disturbances. One of the resolutions challenged Bradburn for \\"advising and procuring servants to quit the service of their masters, and offering them protection; causing them to labor for his benefits, and refusing to compensate them for the same.\\" Republic As the Texas Revolution began in 1835, some slaves sided with Mexico, which provided for freedom. In the fall of 1835, a group of almost 100 slaves staged an uprising along the Brazos River after they heard rumors of approaching Mexican troops. Whites in the area defeated and severely punished them. Several slaves ran away to serve with Mexican forces. Texan forces executed one runaway slave taken prisoner and resold another into slavery.Barr (1996), p. 32. Other slaves joined the Texan forces, with some killed while fighting Mexican soldiers. Three slaves were known to be at the Battle of the Alamo; a boy named John was killed, while William B. Travis's slave Joe and James Bowie's slave Sam survived to be freed by the Mexican Army.Barr (1996), p. 6. The Section 9 of the General Provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, ratified in 1836, made slavery legal again in Texas and defined the status of slaves and people of color in the Republic of Texas. * People of color who had been servants for life under Mexican law would become property. * Congress should pass no law restricting emigrants from bring their slaves into Texas. * Congress shall not have the power to emancipate slaves. * Slaveowners may not free their slaves without Congressional approval unless the freed slaves leave Texas. * Free persons of African descent were required to petition the Texas Congress for permission to continue living in the country. * Africans and the descendants of Africans and Indians were excluded from the class of 'persons' having rights. The following year all those who had been living in Texas at the time of independence were allowed to remain. On the other hand, the legislature created political segregation; it classified free residents with at least 1/8 African heritage (the equivalent to one great-grandparent) as a separate category, and abrogated their citizens' rights, prohibiting them from voting, owning property, testifying against whites in court, or intermarrying with whites.Barr (1996), p. 8. As planters increased cotton production, they rapidly increased the purchase and transport of slaves. By 1840 there were 11,323 slaves in Texas. Statehood In 1845 the state legislature passed legislation further restricting the rights of free blacks. For example, it subjected them to punishments, such as working on road gangs if convicted of crimes, similar to those of slaves rather than free men.Barr (1996), p. 9. By 1850, the slave population in Texas had increased to 58,161; in 1860 there were 182,566 slaves, 30 percent of the total population. Texas ranked 10th in total slave population and 9th in percentage of slave population (30 percent of all residents). Forty percent of Texas slaves lived on plantations along the Gulf Coast and in the East Texas river valleys, where they cultivated cotton, corn, and some sugar. Fifty percent of the slaves worked either alone or in groups of fewer than 20 on small farms ranging from the Nueces River to the Red River, and from the Louisiana border to the edge of the western settlements of San Antonio, Austin, Waco, and Fort Worth.Barr (1996), p. 19. Some slaves lived among the cattlemen along the southern Gulf Coast and helped herd sheep and cattle. Rarely, a slave also broke horses, but generally only white men were used for that dangerous task. If they died, the boss did not suffer a monetary loss.Barr (1996), p. 20. Slaves were not held between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. A large supply of cheap Mexican labor in the area made the purchase and care of a slave too expensive. Although most slaves lived in rural areas, more than 1000 resided in both Galveston and Houston by 1860, with several hundred in other large towns.Barr (1996), p. 24. Unlike in most southern cities, the number of urban slaves in Texas grew throughout the 1850s. Most worked as house servants or on farms on the edges of towns, but others served as cooks and waiters in hotels, as teamsters or boatmen, or as coachmen and skilled artisans, such as blacksmiths, carpenters, and barbers.Barr (1996), p. 24. Plantation slaves generally lived in one or two- room log cabins. Most field hands received two sets of clothing twice each year, with a hat and coat for winter. Meals often consisted of bread, molasses, sweet potatoes, hominy, and beef, chicken, and pork.Barr (1996), p. 18. Slaves often lived similarly to the whites in Texas, especially those new to the territory and just getting started. The whites, however, could hope to improve their lives with their own hard work, while the slaves could have no such hope or expectation as, of course, their work belonged by law to their owners and not to them. Many churches in Texas accepted slaves as members. Both the Baptist and Methodist churches appointed missionaries to the slaves and allowed active participation by them. In 1860, the Methodists claimed 7,541 slaves among their members in Texas. Some slaves became ministers, but their masters often tried to instruct them in what they were supposed to preach. As in other southern states, however, the slaves made Christianity their own and they developed strong religious faith.Barr (1996), p. 22. Many local communities adopted laws forbidding slaves from having liquor or weapons, from selling agricultural products, hiring their own time, or being hired by free blacks. In rural areas, counties often set up patrols to enforce restrictions on slaves' traveling without passes from planter owners.Barr (1996), p. 21. Urban slaves often had greater freedoms and opportunity.Barr (1996), p. 25. Unlike most southern states, Texas did not explicitly ban education of slaves, but most slave owners did not allow the practice. In 1865, 95% of the slaves were illiterate.Barr (1996), p. 23. Many slaves ran away. Some hid in the bayous for a time, while others lived among the Indians, and a few managed to board ships bound for northern or foreign ports. Most runaway slaves attempted to go to Mexico.Barr (1996), p. 28. By 1850, an estimated 3,000 slaves had successfully escaped to Mexico, and an additional 1,000 crossed into Mexico between 1851 and 1855. Ninety percent of the runaways were men, most between ages 20 and 40, because they were best equipped to deal with the long, difficult journey. All ages were represented, however, from 5 months to 60 years.Barr (1996), p. 30. As early as 1836, Texas slaveholders sent representatives to Matamoros to try to reclaim their runaway slaves, but Mexico refused. A group of slaves killed the sheriff of Gonzales when he attempted to stop their going to Matamoros. Over 30 of the fugitives made it safely to freedom in Mexico.Barr (1996), p. 29. From 1849 until 1860, Texas tried to convince the United States government to negotiate a treaty with Mexico to permit extradition of runaway slaves, but it did not succeed. Some slave hunters illegally traveled to Mexico and captured runaways. After Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carvajal promised to return all escaped slaves, more than 400 Texans joined his revolt of 1851. He tried to create a Republic of Sierra Madre in Northern Mexico but was defeated by the Mexican Army.Barr (1996), p. 31. White Texans were fearful about slave revolts, and as in other southern states, rumors of uprisings took hold rapidly, often in times of economic and social tension. In 1854, citizens in Austin and other towns drove many poor Mexicans from the area in fear that they might assist in slave revolts.Barr (1996), p. 26. Two years later, Colorado County hanged several slaves and drove one white man and several Mexicans from the area after uncovering a plot to equip 200 slaves with pistols and knives to escape into Mexico. In 1860, mass hysteria ensued after a series of fires erupted throughout the state. Planters had hundreds of slaves arrested and questioned forcefully. Several confessed to a plot by white abolitionists to avenge John Brown's execution by burning food supplies and poisoning slaveowners. Up to 80 slaves and 37 whites may have been executed as a result of the supposed plot.Barr (1996), p. 33. Later newspaper accounts revealed that most of what was confessed under torture appeared to be false. Many of the fires had coincided with a summer drought, and new matches were susceptible to spontaneous combustion. The supposed \\"poison\\" found in slave quarters was baby powder.Barr (1996), p. 34. There was a slave auction block next to the Menger Hotel and near the Alamo.Express Newspaper, 1939, University of Texas at San Antonio archives Confederacy Texas seceded from the United States in 1861, and joined the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. It replaced the pro-Union governor, Sam Houston, in the process. During the war, slavery in Texas was little affected, and prices for slaves remained high until the last few months of the war. The number of slaves in the state increased dramatically as the Union Army occupied parts of Arkansas and Louisiana. Slaveholders in those areas often moved their slaves to Texas to avoid having them emancipated. By 1865 there were an estimated 250,000 slaves in Texas. Many planters, however, lost part of their workforce temporarily to the Confederate Army, which impressed one-quarter of the slaves on each plantation to construct defensive earthworks for the Texas coast and to drive military supply wagons.Barr (1996), p. 36. Anyone convicted of providing arms to slaves during the war was sentenced to between two and five years of hard labor. Unlike in other Southern states, only a small number of Texas slaves, estimated at 47, joined the Union Army. Few battles took place in Texas, which acted as a supply state to the Confederacy. As Texas was much more distant from the Union Army lines for much of the war, slaves were unable to reach them.Barr (1996), p. 37. The last battle of the war was fought at Palmito Ranch near Brownsville, in 1865. Emancipation On June 19, 1865, Union General Gordon Granger and over 2,000 federal troops arrived at Galveston Island to take possession of the state and enforce the two-year-old Emancipation Proclamation. There, he proclaimed his \\"General Order No. 3\\" on the balcony of Ashton Villa: > The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation > from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves > an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between > former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between > them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised > to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are > informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that > they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere. On some plantations, many slaves left immediately after hearing of the emancipation, even if their former owners offered to pay them wages.Barr (1996), p. 40. Throughout the summer, many East Texas newspapers continued to recommend that slaveholders oppose ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, in the hopes that emancipation could be gradually implemented. Some slaveowners did not free their slaves until late in 1865.Barr (1996), p. 39. Slavery was officially abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment which took effect on December 18, 1865. Slavery had been theoretically abolished by President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation which proclaimed, in 1863, that only slaves located in territories that were in rebellion from the United States were free. Since the U.S. government was not in effective control of many of these territories until later in the war, many of these slaves proclaimed to be free by the Emancipation Proclamation were still held in servitude until those areas came back under Union control. Legacy June 19, the day of the Emancipation announcement, has been celebrated annually in Texas and other states as Juneteenth. The long-term effects of slavery can be seen to this day in the state's demographics. The eastern quarter of the state, where cotton production depended on thousands of slaves, is considered the westernmost extension of the Deep South. It contains a very significant number of Texas' African-American population. On the other hand, western parts of Texas were still a frontier during the American Civil War. While settled chiefly by Anglo-Southerners after the war; with the history of ranching, some of these parts have been more associated with the Southwest than the South. After whites regained power in Texas and other southern states in the 1870s, they imposed a system of legalized racial segregation and white supremacy. In 1876 Texas adopted a new constitution requiring segregated schools and imposing a poll tax, which decreased the number of poor voters both black and white.\\"1876 Constitution\\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed 12 Apr 2008 By the late 19th century, Texas passed other Jim Crow laws. The system of school support was inadequate, and schools for racial minorities were seriously underfunded. Texas did not, however, employ techniques common in other Southern states such as complex voter registration rules and literacy tests; even the \\"white primary\\" was not implemented statewide until 1923.Donald S. Strong, \\"The Rise of Negro Voting in Texas,\\" American Political Science Review Vol. 42 (June, 1948): 510, 511-12. In 1900 African Americans comprised 30% of the state's population of 3,084,710.Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia , accessed 15 Mar 2008 The drop in proportion of population reflected greatly-increased European immigration to the state in the 19th century, as well as population growth. Like Georgia, the Texas Democratic Party adopted a whites-only primary. Since they politically dominated the state for decades after 1900, the only contest for office was at the primary level. The white primary was another way to exclude African Americans from making electoral decisions, and it was not overturned by the Supreme Court until 1944 in Smith v. Allwright. States that had used it adopted other means to keep most African Americans from voting. African Americans immediately started raising legal challenges to disfranchisement, but early Supreme Court cases, such as Giles v. Harris (1903), upheld the states. Through organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), African Americans continued to work to regain their ability to exercise their civil and voting rights as citizens. The civil rights movement led to the U.S. Congress and President Lyndon Johnson passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which protected the rights of all citizens to integrated public facilities and enforcement of voting rights. On June 25, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act as unconstitutional, a ruling which was shortly followed the implementation of Voter i.d. laws in Texas. Those against this decision typically argue that it unfairly targets key Democratic constituencies such as minority groups and the elderly, while proponents argue that the law's intention is to prevent voting by illegal immigrants, which has been an issue in the past.

E.267-1942 A fashion plate is an illustration (a plate) demonstrating the highlights of fashionable styles of clothing. Traditionally they are rendered through etching, line engraving, or lithograph and then colored by hand. To quote historian James Laver, the best of them tend to \\"reach a very high degree of aesthetic value.\\"Laver, James. Fashions and Fashion Plates 1800-1900. London and New York: Penguin Books Limited, 1943, p. 3 Fashion plates do not usually depict specific people. Instead they take the form of generalized portraits, which simply dictate the style of clothes that a tailor, dressmaker, or store could make or sell, or demonstrate how different materials could be made up into clothes. The majority can be found in ladies' fashion magazines which began to appear during the last decades of the eighteenth century. Used figuratively, as is often the case, the term refers to a person whose dress conforms to the latest fashions. Fashion plates are frequently used as primary source material for the study of historical fashions, although commentators warn that as they were high-end aspirational catalogues it should not be assumed that the majority of people dressed in the same way expressed by a plate. A more accurate way to use fashion plates for study is to treat them like a modern high-end fashion magazine or designer's shop window with only a few people wearing such luxury items.  History  Prior to the French Revolution, fashion plates were few and far between. This method of disseminating fashionable styles was mostly popular during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Their origins, however, date back to the 16th century, even if the history may not be continuous. Portraits, especially royal portraits, served as the base for the future of fashion plates, as they offered a visual cue as to the popular styles, fabrics and embellishments of the time. Dolls were also popular prior to fashion plates. In fact, Marie Antoinette's dressmaker, Rose Bertin, was known to tour the continent every year with berlines containing dolls outfitted with the latest fashionable styles. Fashion plates were first circulated at the end of the 18th century in England, rather than in France, as would be expected. \\"The Lady's Magazine\\", one of the first distributors of fashion plates in magazines, began publishing in 1770, spreading the trend across Europe. In France, La Galerie des Modes was a pioneer in fashion plate publication. Encompassing over 400 prints, this series was issued sporadically by the print merchants Jacques Esnauts (or Esnault) and Michel Rapilly between the years 1778 and 1787 and paved the way for the distribution of popular magazines such as the Magazin des Modes Nouvelles Fran√ßaises et Anglaises. As technology improved, speed of communication and transportation increased, thus allowing consumers access to foreign fashions, accessories and hairstyles. The introduction of an educated middle class also allowed for a more fashion- conscious population that became devoted to fashion plate publications. Fashion plate, Godey's Lady's Book, January 1837 By the 1830s, U.S. magazines began to include their own fashion plates, although these were often derived from imported French originals. The most popular magazines of the antebellum period, including Godey's Lady's Book and its competitors, particularly Graham's Magazine and Peterson's Magazine, boasted about the quality of their fashion plates. Publisher Louis Antoine Godey claimed in January 1857 that his fashion plates - hand-colored by a corps of 150 women colorists - \\"surpass all others.\\" Godey also made sure his readers were aware of the considerable cost of his fashion plates, and indeed, some readers removed them from the magazine and displayed them as art. It was a common assumption in the antebellum United States that \\"Character is displayed, yes! moral taste and goodness, or their perversion, are indicated in dress.\\" Some influential Americans, including Godey's editor Sarah Josepha Hale, expressed concern about the effect of luxurious European fashions on the republican virtues of their countrywomen, and sought to promote simplicity and refinement as the defining trait of American style. However, the subscriber-driven and increasingly competitive market for periodicals meant that fashion plates would become increasingly common throughout the 1840s. To resolve this political problem, periodical editors increasingly touted their fashion plates as original creations, citing New York City or Philadelphia, the fashion capitals of the nation, as inspiration. The increasing popularity of photography in the early 20th century spelled the end for fashion plates, as photos offered a realistic portrayal of fashionable styles. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tomy revived the concept as a toy marketed simply as Fashion Plates.Doll Kind - Fashion PlatesRetroland - Fashion Plates  Fashion Plates v.

He worked as a performance artist as well as creating paintings, assemblages and prints. Work Lemoyne studied at the √âcole des beaux-arts de Montr√©al from 1958 to 1960. He cited as early influences Les Automatistes and the Plasticiens. Lemoyne had a collaborative approach to making art, seeking active engagement between artwork, audience and the artist. He helped found L‚ÄôHorloge du Nouvel-Age in 1964 with Claude P√©loquin, Yves H√©bert and Jean Gauguet-Larouche and a year later, Le Zirmate. Both groups held events combining music, poetry, dance and visual effects to create happenings. Popular culture was a significant subject of his work--he devoted ten years to exploring hockey. bleu, blanc, rouge is a tribute to the Montreal Canadiens whose uniforms are these colors. Blue, white and red are also the colours found in the flags of France and the United Kingdom--the two language heritages that both unite and divide Canada. Perhaps Lemoyne's best-known work is Dryden, an understated portrait of the goalie mask belonging to Montreal Canadiens star goaltender Ken Dryden. A 2001 exhibition organized by Mus√©e r√©gional de Rimouski, Greg Curnoe, Serge Lemoyne : deux nationalismes? paired the francophone Lemoyne's body of work with that of the anglophone Greg Curnoe. In 2008--ten years after the artist's death, the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Sherbrooke (Sherbrooke) organized Salut Lemoyne! an exhibition of work by Lemoyne together with the works of other Quebec artists with whom he was associated, including Armand Vaillancourt, Pierre Gauvreau, Janine Carreau, H√©l√®ne Goulet, Reynald Connolly, Cozic, Fran√ßois Gauthier, Gilles Boisvert, and Serge Tousignant. Art contemporain en fin de si√®cle (1994), produced by Jacques Larr√©, profiled Lemoyne, as well as the photographer Genevi√®ve Cadieux and the artist and architect Melvin Chaney. Lemoyne : documentaire sur la vie et l'oeuvre du peintre Serge Lemoyne (2005) examines Lemoyne's approach to creating art through personal videos, television archives and interviews with his peers, Claude P√©loquin, Marcel Saint-Pierre and Claude Jasmin.

Mechanism  NPRA and NPRB are linked to guanylyl cyclases, while NPRC is G-protein-linked and is a \\"clearance receptor\\" that acts to internalise and destroy the ligand. ANP activation of the ANP catalytic receptor will stimulate its intracellular guanylyl cyclase activity to convert GTP to cGMP. cGMP will then stimulate cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), which will then induce smooth muscle relaxation. This is particularly important in the vasculature, where vascular smooth muscle will bind ANP released as a result of increasing right atrial pressure and will cause the walls of the vasculature to relax. This relaxation will decrease total peripheral resistance, which will in turn decrease venous return to the heart. The decrease in venous return to the heart will reduce the preload and will result in the heart's having to do less work. There is also a soluble guanylyl cyclase that cannot be stimulated by ANP. Instead, vascular endothelial cells will use L-arginine to make nitric oxide via nitric oxide synthase. The nitric oxide will then diffuse into the vascular smooth muscle and will activate the soluble guanylyl cyclase. The subsequent increase in cGMP will cause vasodilation with the same effects as described above. This is why nitroglycerine is given to a person having a heart attack. The nitroglycerine will be metabolized to nitric oxide, which will stimulate soluble guanylyl cyclase. This will result in a decrease in total peripheral resistance and a decrease in preload on the heart. As a result, work done by the heart will decrease and will allow the heart to contract less strongly. Weaker contractions will lead to more blood flow in the coronary arteries, which will help the ischemic cardiac myocytes.  Types  There are three distinct atrial natriuretic factor receptors identified so far in mammals: natriuretic peptide receptors 1, 2, and 3.

Published in 1996 by Seven Stories Press, then reissued in 2006 with two new stories, Night, Again features key authors emerging from the liberalization of ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi in the 1980s, as well as major writers living overseas. The stories include: :\\"Sleeping on Earth\\" by Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã ·∫§m, translated by Phan Huy ƒê∆∞·ªùng and Nina McPherson :\\"A Marker on the Side of the Boat\\" by B·∫£o Ninh, translated by Linh Dinh :\\"Reflections of Spring\\" by D∆∞∆°ng Thu H∆∞∆°ng, translated by Nguy·ªÖn Nguy·ªát C·∫ßm and Linh Dinh :\\"Without a King\\" by Nguy·ªÖn Huy Thi·ªáp, translated by Linh Dinh :\\"The River's Curse\\" by Tr·∫ßn Ng·ªçc Tu·∫•n, translated by Linh Dinh :\\"Scenes from an Alley\\" by L√™ Minh Khu√™, translated by B·∫Øc Ho√†i Tr√¢n and Nina Sachs :\\"The Way Station\\" by ƒê·ªó Ph∆∞·ªõc Ti·∫øn, translated by Phan Huy ƒê∆∞·ªùng and Nina McPherson :\\"A Stagnant Water Place\\" by Th·∫ø Giang, translated by C∆∞·ªùng Nguy·ªÖn :\\"Nine Down Makes Ten\\" by Ph·∫°m Th·ªã Ho√†i, translated by Peter Zinoman :\\"Men, Women and Flowers\\" by ƒê·ª©c Ban, translated by Linh Dinh :\\"In the Recovery Room\\" by Mai Kim Ng·ªçc, translated by Nguy·ªÖn Qu√≠ ƒê·ª©c :\\"Gunboat on the Yangtze\\" by Tr·∫ßn V≈©, translated by Phan Huy ƒê∆∞·ªùng and Nina McPherson :\\"The Pre-War Atmosphere\\" by ƒê·ªó Kh., translated by Linh Dinh :\\"The Ferry Stop in the Country\\" by Nguy·ªÖn Minh Ch√¢u, translated by Linh Dinh  from the Introduction  III The upheavals in the Communist world in the mid 1980s had profound repercussions in Vietnam. After the 1986 Party congress, the term ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi‚Äîor \\"Renovation\\", the Vietnamese version of glasnost, entered the vernacular. In literature, the new era was announced by Secretary General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Linh at a gathering of writers in October 1987. Admitting that the Party had been \\"less than democratic [in the past], and often dogmatic and brutal\\" in its treatment of writers. Linh promised to \\"unbind\\" them from that point on: \\"Speak the truth... No matter what happens, Comrades, don't curb your pen.\\" The Party was only conceding to what was already happening. The ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi literature can be traced to the appearances of novels by Ma VƒÉn Kh√°ng, L√™ L·ª±u and D∆∞∆°ng Thu H∆∞∆°ng in 1985, 1986, 1987, respectively, with essays by the prominent critic Ho√†ng Ng·ªçc Hi·∫øn and the writer-critic Nguy·ªÖn Minh Ch√¢u serving as catalysts. All had impeccable political pedigrees: Kh√°ng, L·ª±u, H∆∞∆°ng and Ch√¢u were Party members who had served in the war (Ch√¢u retired as a colonel); Hi·∫øn is the director of the Nguy·ªÖn Du writing school, originally modeled after the Gorky school in Moscow to develop Socialist writers. Although the situation had been volatile, with books still being banned, editors fired and authors silenced, the government's tactics are not nearly as Draconian as in the past. In 1958, Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu ƒêang, Th·ª•y An and Tr·∫ßn Thi·∫øu B·∫£o were slapped with 15-year sentences in kangaroo courts for their involvements in the Nh√¢n VƒÉn Giai Ph·∫©m movement. IV The wide circulation of D∆∞∆°ng Thu H∆∞∆°ng's first novel, B√™n kia b·ªù ·∫£o v·ªçng [The Other Side Of Illusion] (1987), established her as a vanguard for ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi literature. Though her roots are in Socialist Realism, H∆∞∆°ng has broken from the movement's sanctioned subjects by listing Party members among her targets of criticism. Later, with the appearance of Nh·ªØng thi√™n ƒë∆∞·ªùng m√π [Paradise Of The Blind] (1988) and Ti·ªÉu thuy·ªÅt v√¥ ƒë·ªÅ [Novel without a Name] (1994) in foreign translations, plus her increasing outspokenness and seven-month imprisonment in 1991, H∆∞∆°ng became Vietnam's most visible writer and dissident. Politics notwithstanding, her gift as a writer is as a purveyor of the quotidian. In the word of one critic: \\"She is unmatched in her ability to capture the small, telling details of everyday life.\\" Huong's first book, a volume of stories called Ch√¢n dung ng∆∞·ªùi h√†ng x√≥m [Portrait of a Neighbor] (1985), revealed both her strengths and weaknesses. In the story \\"Th·ª£ l√†m m√≥ng tay\\" [\\"The Manicurist\\"], fine descriptive passages are perverted by a heavy- handed political subtext. Its bias can be traced to the war, in which both North and South had demonized the other: :Two cousins, separated for 21 years by the civil war, met again when the narrator, a member of the victorious army, arrived in Saigon in 1975. She found Sang, once \\"a fit, alert child, with a ruddy complexion\\", who had vowed to take revenge on the French for killing his father, turned into a pale, listless man obsequiously painting women's toe nails. Sang lived with a busty wife in \\"a sort of hovel\\" next to an open sewer, where they bickered endlessly. As a mascot for the decadent South, Sang's two solaces were his electric guitar and prostitution. A circus act in the zoo, featuring a midget with two monkeys, provided the narrator with an apt analogy to ram the author's point home: \\"Out there [in the North], we do not debase ourselves like that, no matter how much money we can make.\\" A story in the same volume, \\"H·ªìi quang c·ªßa m√πa xu√¢n\\" [\\"Reflections of Spring\\"], included in this anthology, showcases H∆∞∆°ng's literary gifts sans soap box. As her vision matured, Huong's technique permutated seamlessly from Socialist Realism to Social Realism. Other authors‚Äîmost notably the acerbic, funny, and occasionally misanthropic L√™ Minh Khu√™‚Äîjoin her as writers of conscience in debunking the Socialist utopia. In place of what the historian Peter Zinoman termed \\"a canned cheeriness... central to the 'moral building' function of the revolutionary writers\\" are bleak portraits of a backward, rundown and corrupt society. Indignant and with an agenda, their goals are not the same as those who, while not eschewing polemics altogether, busy themselves with words and the intangibles of living. V Unfettered by the exigencies of war and politics, many writers are plumbing their own subjectivity and reinventing the multifaceted self. No \\"cultural fighters\\", the only vindication they need is to write well. Ph·∫°m Thi Ho√†i declared: \\"When a writer publishes a good piece of work, he is contributing to changing society. His intention is not to lunge noisily forward to change society, but if the piece is good, one way or another it has already served its social function.\\" In the works of Ho√†i, ƒê·ªó Ph∆∞·ªõc Ti·∫øn, Nguy·ªÖn Huy Thi·ªáp, among others, complex events and emotions are rendered in language both suggestive and opaque. Totalitarian, dogmatic truth is replaced by playful indeterminacy. In one story of Thi·ªáp [\\"L·ª≠a v√†ng\\", \\"Fired Gold\\"], the reader is offered a choice of three endings. In an addendum to another [\\"C√∫n\\"], a scholar friend of the narrator refutes the story proper with a photograph, and hectors the narrator/author to stick to the \\"principles of realism\\". In many of Ph·∫°m Thi Ho√†i's stories, unusual phrasings and diction betrays language as mere artifice. Educated at the University of Humboldt and a translator of Kafka, Ho√†i, a major player in ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi literature, now lives in Berlin. Other important writers have emigrated or spent significant time overseas. D∆∞∆°ng Thu H∆∞∆°ng lived in Russia, and the protagonist of her most successful novel, Nh·ªØng thi√™n ƒë∆∞·ªùng m√π [Paradise of the Blind], is a Vietnamese \\"guest worker\\" in the former Soviet Union. The gifted and highly touted Tr·∫ßn V≈© escaped Vietnam by boat at the age of 16 and was raised as an orphan in France. Published in California, V≈©'s fiction, populated mostly by Vietnamese characters, living inside or outside of Vietnam, alternates between a crisp, no-nonsense prose and a perversely-wrought archaism, extending the language in contrary directions. Although it may be invigorated by foreign influences, the soul of any literature is in its relationship to the vernacular. Often overlooked in the buzz surrounding Nguy·ªÖn Huy Thi·ªáp‚ÄîVietnam's most influential writer‚Äîis his exceptional ear for the language. Thi·ªáp's sophisticated yet earthy fiction is enlivened by many memorable phrases culled from ordinary speech. A teacher in remote S∆°n La province for 10 years, he now runs a restaurant in Hanoi a stone's throw from a much-bombed bridge on the Red River. At 45, he has never traveled abroad [true as of 1996, when this piece was written]. Considering the paucity of translated books in Vietnam, even after the easing of state censorship, Thi·ªáp's eclectic reading list, as revealed in his own essays and interviews, is an index to the mental life of a contemporary Hanoi intellectual: all the great Vietnamese poets, from the 15th century Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i to Nguy·ªÖn Du; Chinese modern fiction pioneer Lu Tsun; 1st century BC Chinese historian Si Ma Quan (in Phan Ng·ªçc's translation); The Three Kingdoms; Dostoyevski; Gogol; Gorky; Maupassant; Camus; Goethe; Tagore; Neruda; the Bible. Western and overseas Vietnamese critics, in assessing his varied output, have tripped over each other delineating his affinities with experimental writers such as Borges, Eco and Rushdie, most of whom he has never heard of. Like Europeans discovering Modernism through African sculptures, Thi·ªáp arrived at something like Post-Modernism through the goblin stories of Lƒ©nh Nam Ch√≠ch Qu√°i and lores of the Black Thai minority. The stories in Night, Again testify to the resilience of literature in a country which does not reward and often punishes its best writers, where the most famous author is banned and the most accomplished is an erudite maitre d'. For those in exile, there is the unreality of writing in a language one does not hear everyday for a tiny and scattered audience.

It was created in the partition of territories in Mecklenburg that followed the death of Henry Borwin II of Mecklenburg (died 1226). The royal (f√ºrstlich in German) House of Werle was a spur line of the House of Mecklenburg line of the Obotrites. The Fiefdom of Werle lay in the area around G√ºstrow in today's Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, and stretched eastward to M√ºritz. It was named after the then-capital Werle, now a village in the municipality Kassow, Rostock district. The fiefdom collapsed several times into separate dominions. In 1277 it was divided among the sons of the first lord, or Herr in German, into Werle-G√ºstrow and Werle-Parchim. In 1307, both were reunited by Nicholas II, but they were divided again in 1316 into Werle-G√ºstrow and Werle-Goldberg. In 1337, Werle-Waren split off from the Werle-G√ºstrow line. With the death of the William, the last lord on September 7, 1436, the fiefdom once again reverted to Mecklenburg. The title of Lord of Werle was thenceforth carried by all rulers of Mecklenburg. Werle is represented in one of the seven fields of the coat of arms of Mecklenburg.

She arrived with another person in Angola, a nation rich in oil reserves, but 95 per cent of the country's population living below the poverty line. The government has been criticized for mismanagement and many independent organizations including the International Monetary Fund sought independent investigation into the accounts. Cabinda is a region in Angola that produced 1.5 million barrels of petrol everyday. Wyke arrived to Angola on 11 February and her passport was confiscated the next day and her personal belongings like camera, notepad and computer memory stick were seized. An unspecified crime against state security was quoted as the reason of the arrest. She was left on bail three days later and was allowed to return to Britain, while the investigation continued in Angola. At the time of arrest on 18 February 2007, she was discussing the issue of revenue transparency with the leaders in Cabinda. Global Witness demanded access to her lawyers, immediate and unconditional release, an apology for ill-treating her from the Angolan Government. They also wanted the UK Government and international actors in Angola to expedite her release.

Plot The film begins with a sexologist in his office, talking about the history of sex. Izabela (Eva Ras), a Hungarian switchboard operator, meets and falls in love with a Sand≈æak Muslim sanitation inspector named Ahmed (Slobodan Aligrudiƒá), who soon moves into her apartment and has a bathtub installed. The film then cuts away to a police investigation of the death of a young woman by drowning. Ahmed goes away on business for a month. During his absence, Izabela finally gives in to a persistently amorous postman. When Ahmed returns, he finds Izabela different, less loving. (She has found out she is pregnant.) He gets very drunk, and when Isabella chases after him to keep him from harm, he threatens to commit suicide by jumping into an underground vat of water. However, Ahmed ends up accidentally pushing Izabela in instead, killing her. He goes into hiding, but is arrested by the police for murder. The film concludes with a scene of Ahmed and Izabela walking down a staircase.

This masterpiece created a revolution because of the image of naked Isabella with a black cat on her back, one of the most iconic scenes in Yugoslav film history. The film is more a judgement of society on communist regime in that time, and how sexuality, freedom of living and art was banned and restricted by people in power. The film was also considerably unconventional and revolutionary at the time as it incorporated instances of people talking towards the screen, with a sexologist and criminologist both addressing the audience in separate sections of the film. It was also one of the first films to create a plot that was not chronological, with the narrative jumping from one point in time to another.

History  Gothic Saint Catherine church The history of ≈Åasin dates back to the rule of first Polish King Boles≈Çaw I the Brave. Polish brothers Mateusz and Jakub owned land near the ≈Åasinka River (≈Åasin). In the year 1298, it was taken from them by the Country Master of the Teutonic Order Meinhard von Querfurt and given to Jan de Nemore, who founded the village of ≈Åasin. Also in 1298, the town received German Magdeburg law city rights from the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights in which it was located. In 1454, King Casimir IV Jagiellon reincorporated the Che≈Çmno Land to the Kingdom of Poland upon the request of the Prussian Confederation, however, ≈Åasin itself was captured by Poles in 1461 during the subsequent Thirteen Years' War. After the war, in 1466, the Teutonic Knights renounced claims to the town, and recognized it as part of Poland. Administratively it was located in the Che≈Çmno Voivodeship in the province of Royal Prussia in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the town, as Lessen, was annexed by King Frederick II of Prussia and made part of the German Kingdom of Prussia. In 1871, during the unification of Germany, it became part of the Prussian-led German Empire and in 1920, in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles, ≈Åasin became part of the Polish Republic, after it regained independence in 1918. In interwar Poland, the mayor of ≈Åasin was Stefan Tomczy≈Ñski, a Polish activist and efficient administrator, who was previously harassed by Prussians for pro-Polish activity in the Prussian Partition.

In humans, the oxytocin receptor is encoded by the OXTR gene which has been localized to human chromosome 3p25. Evolutionary tree of the oxytocin, vasotocin, mesotocin and isotocin receptors and their ligands. From Koechbach et al. Function and location The OXTR protein belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor family, specifically Gq, and acts as a receptor for oxytocin. Its activity is mediated by G proteins that activate several different second messenger systems. Oxytocin receptors are expressed by the myoepithelial cells of the mammary gland, and in both the myometrium and endometrium of the uterus at the end of pregnancy. The oxytocin-oxytocin receptor system plays an important role as an inducer of uterine contractions during parturition and of milk ejection. Oxytocin receptors are also present in the central nervous system. These receptors modulate a variety of behaviors, including stress and anxiety, social memory and recognition, sexual and aggressive behaviors, bonding (affiliation) and maternal behavior. (See the oxytocin article for more details.) In some mammals, oxytocin receptors are also found in the kidney and heart. Mesolimbic dopamine pathways The oxytocinergic circuit projecting from the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) innervates the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens, i.e., the mesolimbic pathway. Activation of the PVN‚ÜíVTA projection by oxytocin affects sexual, social, and addictive behavior via this link to the mesolimbic pathway; specifically, oxytocin exerts a prosexual and prosocial effect in this region.  Polymorphism  The receptors for oxytocin (OXTR) have genetic differences with varied effects on individual behavior. The polymorphism (rs53576) occurs on the third intron of OXTR in three types: GG, AG, AA. The GG allele is connected with oxytocin levels in people . A-allele carrier individuals are associated with more sensitivity to stress, fewer social skills, and more mental health issues than the GG-carriers. In a study looking at empathy and stress, individuals with the allele GG scored higher than A-carrier individuals in a \\"Reading the Mind in the Eyes\\" test. GG carriers, with their naturally higher levels of oxytocin , were better able to distinguish between emotions. A-allele carriers responded with more stress to stressful situations than GG-allele carriers. A-allele carriers had lower scores on psychological resources, like optimism, mastery, and self-esteem, than GG individuals when measured with factor analysis for depressive symptomology and psychological resources, along with the Beck Depression Inventory. A-allele carriers had higher depressive symptomology and lower psychological resources than GG individuals. A-allele individuals scored lower in human sociality than GG people on a Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. AA individuals had the lowest amygdala activation while processing emotionally salient information and those with GG had the highest activity when tested using BOLD during an fMRI. A study looking at facial recognition in British and Finnish families with a single high-functioning autistic child found that a single change in the DNA had a major impact on face memory, with AA individuals having impaired SD scores. The frequency of the A allele varies among ethnic groups, being significantly more common among East Asians than Europeans.  Ligands  Several selective ligands for the oxytocin receptor have recently been developed, but close similarity between the oxytocin and related vasopressin receptors make it difficult to achieve high selectivity with peptide derivatives. However the search for a druggable, non-peptide template has led to several potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable oxytocin antagonists.

Unlike a suitcase, a Gladstone bag is \\"deeper in proportion to its length.\\" Gladstones are typically made of stiff leather and often belted with lanyards. The bags are named after William Ewart Gladstone (1809‚Äì1898), the four-time Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. History Hinged luggage was first developed in the mid 19th century. One of the first recorded official documentations of the Gladstone bag is a British patent registered by Edward Cole. Edward Cole was a leather case maker based at No. 9 Hemmings Row, City of Westminster. The patent for \\"An Improvement In The Frames Of Traveling Bags\\" was registered by Edward Cole on 4 February 1854 and sealed 14 July 1854. This original patent is still held by Cole Brothers of England in their archive. The business of Edward Cole was taken over and run by two of his sons James and Edward at the end of the 19th Century and subsequently changed to Cole Brothers in 1907, being located at 24a Floral Street, Covent Garden after the earlier demolition of the Hemmings Row site in 1886 to make way for the extension to the National Gallery. The Gladstone bag should not be confused with the attach√© case-styled red box (also called a dispatch box or ministerial box) which is issued to British Cabinet ministers to carry official paperwork. Red boxes are made by Barrow Hepburn & Gale, and the pattern of the two styles is totally different. When he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gladstone used a red box to carry his 1853 Budget Speech to Parliament. The travelling case to which his name is now attached was not patented until the following year. It has a frame with an opening top, rather than the book-type opening on a spine featured on the red box. By the end of the 19th century, the Gladstone bag had been adopted by doctors to carry their medical equipment. Gladstone bags were also used by the pursers on the RMS Titanic to carry valuables.

King Nebuchadnezzar (left) watches the three youths and the angelic figure in the furnace (right), while the king's gigantic statue towers behind them (centre). Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are figures from the biblical Book of Daniel, primarily chapter 3. In the narrative, three Hebrew men are thrown into a fiery furnace by Nebuchadnezzar II, King of Babylon, when they refuse to bow down to the king's image; the three are preserved from harm and the king sees four men walking in the flames, \\"the fourth ... like a son of God\\". They are first mentioned in Daniel 1, where alongside Daniel they are brought to Babylon to study Chaldean language and literature with a view to them serving at the King's court, and their Hebrew names are replaced with Chaldean or Babylonian names. The first six chapters of Daniel are stories dating from the late Persian/early Hellenistic period, and Daniel's absence from the story of the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace suggests that it may originally have been independent. It forms a pair with the story of Daniel in the lions' den, both making the point that the God of the Jews will deliver those who are faithful to him. Summary Catacomb of Priscilla, Rome, late 3rd century/early 4th century. Depicted on Moone High Cross, Ireland, 10th century King Nebuchadnezzar set up a golden image in the plain of Dura (a word meaning simply \\"plain\\") and commanded that all his officials bow down before it. All who failed to do so would be thrown into a blazing furnace. Certain officials informed the king that the three Jewish youths Hanania, Mishael, and Azariah, who bore the Babylonian names Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and whom the king had appointed to high office in Babylon, were refusing to worship the golden statue. The three were brought before Nebuchadnezzar, where they informed the king that God would be with them. Nebuchadnezzar commanded that they be thrown into the fiery furnace, heated seven times hotter than normal, but when the king looked he saw four figures walking unharmed in the flames, the fourth \\"like a son of God.\\" Seeing this, Nebuchadnezzar brought the youths out of the flames and promoted them to high office, decreeing that anyone who spoke against God should be torn limb from limb. Composition and structure=Book of Daniel It is generally accepted that the Book of Daniel originated as a collection of stories among the Jewish community in Babylon and Mesopotamia in the Persian and early Hellenistic periods (5th to 3rd centuries BCE), expanded by the visions of chapters 7‚Äì12 in the Maccabean era (mid-2nd century). Modern scholarship agrees that Daniel is a legendary figure. It is possible that the name was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition. The tales are in the voice of an anonymous narrator, except for chapter 4, which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar. Chapter 3 is unique in that Daniel does not appear in it. Daniel 3 Daniel 3 forms part of a chiasmus (a poetic structure in which the main point or message of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by further repetitions on either side) within Daniel 2‚Äì7, paired with Daniel 6, the story of Daniel in the lions' den: * A. (2:4b-49) ‚Äì A dream of four kingdoms replaced by a fifth ** B. (3:1‚Äì30) ‚Äì Daniel's three friends in the fiery furnace *** C. (4:1‚Äì37) ‚Äì Daniel interprets a dream for Nebuchadnezzar *** C'. (5:1‚Äì31) ‚Äì Daniel interprets the handwriting on the wall for Belshazzar ** B'. (6:1‚Äì28) ‚Äì Daniel in the lions' den * A'. (7:1‚Äì28) ‚Äì A vision of four world kingdoms replaced by a fifth Chapters 3 and 6 contain significant differences. The story of the fiery furnace does not include Daniel, while the story of the lions' den does not include Daniel's friends; the first story takes place under Nebuchadnezzar and the second under Darius; and in the first story the disobedience to the earthly ruler takes place in public, while in the second Daniel petitions God in private. The stories thus supplement each other to make the point that the God of the Jews will deliver those who are faithful to him. Genre and themes The Three Young Men in the Fiery Furnace (15th century icon of the Novgorod school). The legendary nature of the story is revealed by the liberal use of hyperbole ‚Äì the size of the statue, the use of every kind of music, the destruction of the executioners, and the king's rage followed by his confession of the superiority of the God of Israel. The plot is a type known in folklore as \\"the disgrace and rehabilitation of a minister,\\" the plot of which involves a man in a state of prosperity who is sentenced to death or prison by the plots of his enemies but vindicated and restored to honour. When Nebuchadnezzar confronts the defiant Jewish youths who refuse to submit to his will he asks them what god will deliver them from his hands. Their reply is the theological high point of the story: without addressing the king by his title, they tell him that the question is not whether they are willing to bow before the king's image, but whether God is present and willing to save. When the three are thrown into the furnace the king sees four men walking in the flames, the fourth like \\"a son of god,\\" a divine being. Interpretation Daniel's absence from the tale of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego suggests that it may originally have been an independent story. The Hebrew names of the three youths were Hananiah ( ·∏§ƒÉnanyƒÅh), \\"Yah is gracious\\", Mishael ( M√Æ≈°ƒÅ‚Äô√™l), \\"Who is what El is?\\" and Azariah ( «çzaryƒÅh), \\"Yah has helped\\", but by the king‚Äôs decree they were assigned Chaldean names, so that Hananiah became Shadrach (◊©÷∑◊Å◊ì÷∞◊®÷∑◊ö ≈†a·∏èra·∏µ), Mishael became Meshach (◊û÷µ◊ô◊©÷∑◊Å÷ñ◊ö÷∞ M√™≈°a·∏µ) and Azariah became Abednego (◊¢÷≤◊ë÷µ÷£◊ì◊†÷∞◊í÷ë◊ï÷π ‚Äò«ç·∏á√™·∏è-N…ô·∏°≈ç).while Daniel became Beltheshazzar ( Belteshazzar, . The Chaldean names are related to the Hebrew ones, with the names El and Yah replaced by Babylonian theonyms: ≈†a·∏èra·∏µ may reflect ≈†udur Aku \\"Command of Aku (the moon god)\\",Orr, James, M.A., D.D. General Editor. \\"Entry for 'ERI-AKU'\\". \\"International Standard Bible Encyclopedia\\". 1915 M√™≈°a·∏µ is probably a variation of Mi-≈°a-aku, meaning \\"Who is as Aku is?\\", and Abednego is either \\"Slave of the god Nebo/Nabu\\" or a variation of Abednergal, \\"Slave of the god Nergal.\\" The word \\"Dura\\" (where the statue is erected) means simply \\"plain\\" or \\"fortress\\" and is not any specific place; the Greek historian Herodotus mentions a golden image of the god Bel in Babylon, but the gigantic size of this statue might suggest that its origins lie in folklore. The statue's dimensions (6√ó60 cubits) are linked intertextually with those of Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah's Second Temple (60√ó60 cubits), suggesting that the king's image is contrasted with the post-exilic place of worship for faithful Jews like Daniel. Christian liturgy The Greek version of Daniel 3 inserts \\"the song of the three youths,\\" two psalms, connected by a narrative emphasising their miraculous salvation (an apocryphal addition, numbered Daniel 3:51-90 in some Bible editions). The song is alluded to in odes seven and eight of the canon, a hymn sung in the matins service and on other occasions in the Eastern Orthodox Church. The reading of the story of the fiery furnace, including the song, is prescribed for the vesperal Divine Liturgy celebrated by the Orthodox on Holy Saturday. The Latin canticle Benedicite Dominum is based on the \\"song of the three youths\\". It is used at Lauds for Sundays and feast days. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the feast day of the three youths, along with Daniel, is 17 December. The Orthodox also commemorate them on the two Sundays before the Nativity of Christ. The Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod also includes Daniel and the three youths in the Calendar of Saints on 17 December.

His work recording them with the Irish Folklore Commission helped to ensure that a spoken record of the Manx language survived. __TOC__  Early life  Clarke was raised in Bark Lane in Ramsey. He spent his early years in the company of his grandfather, a retired sea captain in Sulby. It was from his grandfather he learned his first words of the Manx language: \\"Grandfather had lots of Manx, so it came to me quite naturally\\". As a young man away from the Isle of Man on National Service, he came to the realisation that the language he learned from his grandfather was dying without anyone noticing.  Manx language  On his return to the Island, he endeavoured to learn Manx. Firstly he started by visiting the elderly Manx speakers around the Island, who in turn introduced him to the small community of Manx language enthusiasts. They travelled around the Manx countryside on bicycles, visiting the native Manx speakers and learning the language. As Clarke began learning the language he found that there was very little interest at this time from either the Manx people or government in learning and preserving the native language of the Island: > According to Walter Clarke of the Manx Museum, a member of the society, > there is very little enthusiasm for the language in Man to-day. ‚ÄúPeople > think they can pick up Manx in six easy lessons,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúwhen they find > they can‚Äôt they lose interest.‚Äù Evening classes in the main towns were > abandoned recently, and so was the society‚Äôs Manx journal Coraa Ghailckagh. > An effort to get Manx taught in schools also failed.  Irish Folklore Commission recordings  In the summer of 1947 Irish Taoiseach √âamon de Valera visited the Isle of Man. The Taoiseach was a fluent Irish speaker himself and was greatly interested in Gaelic and Celtic cultures. In Ireland, de Valera had been instrumental in setting up the Irish Folklore Commission in 1935 which recorded not only living and dying Irish dialects, but also Irish folklore and customs. As part of his trip to the Isle of Man, de Valera had a conversation with Ned Maddrell, the youngest of the last remaining native speakers, with Maddrell speaking Manx and de Valera in Irish. During his trip, the Taoiseach heard that the Manx language was close to dying out, but that the Manx Museum did not have the facilities or funds to record and preserve the last speakers of the language. On de Valera's request, Kevin Danaher of the Irish Folklore Commission travelled to the Isle of Man with a crate of fragile acetate discs to record the last remaining native speakers on 22 April 1948. Walter Clarke along with Bill Radcliffe helped to transport the recording equipment and acted as a guide for Danaher, bringing him to the remote and isolated locations where the informants lived. They assisted Danaher and spent considerable time before every recording carefully balancing the equipment with a spirit level and connecting batteries and converters as many of the informants did not have electricity. After the visit by the Irish Folklore Commission, Clarke and other members of Yn √áheshaght Ghailckagh continued to record the remaining natives speakers despite technical and financial restraints: \\"We just ‚Äì we wanted to record the old people but we didn‚Äôt, we had neither the money nor the means of doing it\\". These recordings were often made at significant financial expense to themselves; John Gell for example loaned them ¬£8 to purchase the necessary equipment. Clarke in particular enjoyed speaking to John Kneen, also known as Yn Gaaue (the blacksmith) of which several recordings were made. Like Clarke, Kneen was from the north of the Island and was a very willing informant: > I think 95 or 96 when I first met him, he lived to be over 100, of course, > he went blind, sadly, towards the end, but a tremendous character. He‚Äôd been > a blacksmith, he‚Äôd been a farmer, he‚Äôd been a miller, you know, he really > was a wonderful person.  Later years  Clarke worked as a technician and curator at the Manx Museum. He create the Folk Life gallery and collected stories from informants from all over the Island, as well and material and artefacts for the Museum. Clarke later revived the teaching of Manx in Ramsey by setting up evening classes and talks. Clarke also transcribed the recordings of the Irish Folklore Commission of the native Manx speakers into English and donated them to the Manx Museum: > It's slow work, but I enjoy doing it because it takes me back and I'm with > the old people, sitting by the hearth again. But it also makes me sad, > because their like is not about any more. There's something about the > character that has been lost. They were remarkable people. They led a hard > life, but they weren't bothered with stress. Time wasn't money like it is > today. None of them had travelled very much, except to the fair in Douglas, > but they were much more contented than people are today. In recognition of his lifetime of work in preserving the culture and language of the Isle of Man, Clarke received the Reih Bleeaney Vanannan award in 2001.

He was portrayed in the Academy Award-winning film The Killing Fields by actor John Malkovich, although he has never been happy with this portrayal. Rockoff was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and is of half Russian and half Irish ancestry. After enlisting in the Navy while under age, he subsequently became an Army photographer in South Vietnam.  Career  After several years in Vietnam, Rockoff came to the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh in the spring of 1973, when the US-backed government of Lon Nol was fighting the Khmer Rouge insurgents. Both houses of Congress had voted to end USAF bombing missions over Cambodia that summer, and many journalists expected the fall of Phnom Penh was imminent. Rockoff was known to take tremendous risks to get his pictures at a time when any foreign journalist falling into Khmer Rouge hands could expect execution. In October 1974, he was badly wounded by shrapnel in an attack near the strategic city of Kampong Chhnang, and technically 'died' for several minutes before his heart was revived by a Swedish Red Cross team. In April 1975, Rockoff was one of five US newsmen to remain in Phnom Penh when the US embassy launched a helicopter evacuation of its staff. On the morning of the city's fall, he was visiting the Preah Keth Melea hospital with reporters Sydney Schanberg of The New York Times and Jon Swain of The Sunday Times when they were arrested by a furious company of teenage Khmer Rouge soldiers. Only the intervention of Schanberg's assistant Dith Pran saved their lives. Most westerners took refuge in the French embassy from which they were taken by truck to Thailand two weeks later. But Cambodian citizens sheltering there, including government ministers seeking asylum, were ordered out. No exceptions were allowed, although some Cambodian women married to westerners could remain if they had documentation. Some did not survive the forced exodus to the countryside where they were expected to work in the fields. Rockoff tried to forge a passport for Dith Pran using an old passport belonging to Jon Swain. He is incensed at the way the 'Killing Fields' movie portrayed this, particularly scenes which appear to show him fixing up an improvised dark room and chemical solution while a photo of Pran fades away, until he finally gets it. In reality, Pran had an old photograph which Rockoff successfully attached to a passport. Eventually, Pran left the embassy of his own volition. As a result of this discrepancy, Rockoff and another journalist named Denis Cameron have publicly disassociated themselves from the movie. Rockoff splits his time between his homes in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, US. He still works as a photographer. Some of his images have been exhibited in The Foreign Correspondent's Club in Phnom Penh and he continues to work on a book of photos about Cambodian history since 1970. Controversy continues to surround his photography: He voted against Al Gore in the 2000 US Presidential election over an incident reputed to have occurred when both served in Vietnam. In 2008, Rockoff worked on collaborations with artist Shepard Fairey. These combine Rockoff's images of the Vietnam War and the Khmer Rouge with a modern poster art style. In December 2008, Rockoff exhibited his images of the fall of Phnom Penh for the first time in the US at Composition Gallery in Atlanta.

Its purpose was to win agreement on measures to fight the Great Depression, revive international trade, and stabilize currency exchange rates. It collapsed after it was \\"torpedoed\\" by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt in early July when he denounced currency stabilization. Background When the Great Depression devastated the world economy in 1929 to 1932, it was generally assumed that the United States would serve as a hegemon, providing leadership for a program to bring about recovery. US President Herbert Hoover in 1931 called for a conference to decide how to reduce tariffs and also revive prices by reversing the deflation associated with the Depression. The agenda for the Conference was drafted by representatives of six major nations who met in Geneva in 1932. The agenda asserted that intergovernmental debts should be settled, as they represented a major obstacle in the road to recovery. The Europeans believed that \\"the settlement should relieve the world\\" of the crushing debt burdens.League of Nations, Draft Annotated Agenda, Official Number: C.48.M.18 (Conference M.E.1) II (Geneva: League of nations, 1933) 7-9; Foreign Relations of the United States, 1933 I (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1950) 453, 462-6. However, most of these debts were owed to the US, which was reluctant to write them off. US Senator William Edgar Borah held that \\"the troubles of the world were really due to the War, and to the persistence of Europe in keeping great armaments, and to the mismanagement of money\\" and so he was not willing to postpone, reduce, or cancel the payment of debts \\"and have Europe go ahead with a programme which has practically sunk the world into its present economic condition.\\"The World Economic Conference, Herbert Samuel, International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1931-1939), Vol. 12, No. 4. (Jul., 1933) 445. Other events indicated that the US would not support the Conference agenda as outlined. Roosevelt declared during his inaugural speech, \\"I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment.\\" That was a clear signal to those in the Conference that Roosevelt would carry out his program to revive the American economy regardless of or even against international plans to revive the world economy.Roosevelt: America's Strategist, M. A. Fitzsimons, The Review of Politics, Vol. 7, No. 3. (Jul., 1945), 283. Roosevelt took the US off the gold standard in April.H. W.

(Mar., 1971) 867. Rejection by Roosevelt When the conference opened on June 12, 1933, all attention rested on the tripartite currency discussions happening outside it. The big issue was the exchange rate of the US dollar against foreign currencies, such as the British pound and French franc. Many in the US favored devaluation of the dollar to improve the US trade position. France and Britain wanted to stabilize the dollar rate by fixing it at a relatively-high value. US Secretary of State Cordell Hull led the American delegation to the conference. Roosevelt ordered Hull not to enter into any discussions on currency stabilization. However, when the Conference had gathered, Roosevelt changed his mind by supporting currency manipulation to raise prices and having American banking experts Oliver Mitchell Wentworth Sprague and James Paul Warburg conduct currency stabilization talks with their British and French counterparts.The Ordeal of Cordell Hull, Julius W. Pratt, The Review of Politics, Vol. 28, No. 1. (Jan., 1966) 83. By June 15, Sprague, Warburg, Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, and Clement Moret of the Bank of France had drafted a plan for temporary stabilization. Word of the plan leaked out. The reaction in the US was negative, the dollar rose against foreign currencies, threatening US exports, and stock and commodity markets were depressed. Although Roosevelt was considering shifting his policy to a new median dollar-pound rate, he eventually decided not to enter into any commitment, even a tentative one. On June 17, fearing the British and the French would seek to control their own exchange rates, Roosevelt rejected the agreement in spite of his negotiators' pleas that the plan was only a temporary device, which was full of escape clauses.Jeannette P. Nichols, \\"Roosevelt's Monetary Diplomacy in 1933,\\" American Historical Review, (1951) 56#2 pp. 295-317 in JSTOR On June 30, Roosevelt went further. In an interview with four reporters, he openly criticized stabilization. On July 3, he issued a message to the conference that condemned its efforts at stabilization when \\"broader problems\\" existed and asserted that the exchange rate of a nation's currency was less important than other economic values. Roosevelt's rejection of the agreement gathered an overwhelmingly-negative response from British, French, and US internationalists. British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald feared that \\"Roosevelt's actions would destroy the Conference\\" and Georges Bonnet, rapporteur of the French Monetary Commission, is said to have \\"exploded.\\" Critics see nationalism as a key factor in Roosevelt's decision.The London Monetary and Economic Conference of 1933: A Public Goods Analysis, Rodney J. Morrison, The American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Vol. 52, No. 3. (Jul., 1993), pp. 312, 314. However, the British economist John Maynard Keynes hailed Roosevelt's decision as \\"magnificently right\\" and the US economist Irving Fisher wrote to Roosevelt that the message \\"makes me the happiest of men.\\" Hugenberg controversy Another area of dispute was created by the head of the German delegation, Economics Minister, Alfred Hugenberg, who put forth a program of German colonial expansion in both Africa and Eastern Europe as the best way of ending the Great Depression, which created a major storm at the conference.Hildebrand, Klaus The Foreign Policy of the Third Reich London: Batsford 1973 pages 31-32.

It lies on the Dunajec river, and along National Road Nr. 75. In the years 1928-2000, Czch√≥w was a village. The history of Czch√≥w dates back to the time when this part of Poland probably belonged to Great Moravia. Some sources claim that the very name of the town is of Czech origin, as in the documents from the 13th century, it was spelled Czechou, Cechou, and Cehiov. According to Jan D≈Çugosz, among first residents of the settlements were Germans, captured by King Boles≈Çaw Chrobry during his wars with the Holy Roman Empire. In 1280, Princess Kinga of Poland met here with Prince of Krak√≥w, Leszek Czarny to discuss a conflict among Piast princes. At that time the village of Czch√≥w belonged to the Bishops of Krak√≥w, and at the beginning of the 14th century, it became a royal possession. During the reign of King Casimir III the Great, Czch√≥w was surrounded by a defensive wall, and on November 24, 1355, it received Magdeburg rights. On a surrounding hill the Czch√≥w Castle was built, to protect a merchant route along the Dunajec river towards Kingdom of Hungary, and a custom house. The castle was based on an earlier, Romanesque watchtower. View of the town in 2015 By 1357, Czch√≥w already was the seat of a castellan, a starosta, and of a county, located in Lesser Poland‚Äôs Krak√≥w Voivodeship. Here, local szlachta met for their councils (see sejmik), and the town was a location of a court. In 1433, Czch√≥w received a privilege to organize a fair, and in 1565, King Sigismund Augustus marked Czch√≥w as the location of permanent border fairs. The town was conveniently located along a Dunajec river merchant route to Kingdom of Bohemia and Kingdom of Hungary. Czch√≥w was an important urban center, which in 1545 got its own waterworks and sewage system. In the 16th century, Czch√≥w was one of centers of Protestant Reformation, here Fausto Sozzini lived for a few years. The period of prosperity ended in the mid-17th century. Old merchant route along the Dunajec was replaced with new routes, the river frequently flooded the town, and the area was devastated in the Swedish invasion of Poland. In 1662 the population of Czch√≥w was reduced to only 500, and in 1690, after a disastrous flood, only 36 houses remained. The castle lost its military importance, and was turned into a prison. After the Partitions of Poland, Czch√≥w became part of Austrian province of Galicia (1772), where it remained until 1918. The decline was so severe, that in 1928, the government of the Second Polish Republic reduced it to the status of a village.

It is located about from Tarn√≥w, near the town of Tuch√≥w, and had town privileges in 1824‚Äì1934, and from 2001. Between 1975 and 1998, Ryglice administratively belonged to Tarn√≥w Voivodeship. On 30 June 2007, the population of the town was 2,811.http://ryglice-okolice.pl/ Information Ryglice is a local road junction, with three roads meeting here. The town does not have a rail station, and the nearest one is located in Tuch√≥w. It has a sports club (KS Ryglice), with men‚Äôs football and volleyball departments. Among historic buildings worth visiting is the church from 1940 with antique equipment and a vicarage, palace and a granary all dating back to the 18th century. Recently Ryglice became famous for the controversial \\"monument of Emigration\\", which was established at the initiative of the Mayor of Ryglice Bernard Karasiewicz.http://ryglice.pl/ History First documented mention of Ryglice comes from the year 1301, when Duke and later King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high allowed local noblemen W≈Çadys≈Çaw Burza and Wawrzyniec Kielanowski to own the village. Ryglice prospered during the reign of Casimir III the Great, but it did not receive a town charter, remaining a village. Wars of the 17th century, such as the Swedish invasion of Poland, devastated Ryglice. In 1656, a skirmish between Polish and Swedish soldiers took place here, after which the local stream was called Szwedka (literally meaning Swede). Following the Partitions of Poland, Ryglice was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of Galicia (1772‚Äì1918). Local peasants actively participated in the Galician slaughter, murdering members of the nobility. In November 1914, during World War I, the village was captured by the Russians, who remained here until May 1915. There are several World War I military cemeteries in the area of Ryglice. During World War II, Ryglice‚Äôs Jewish community was murdered by the Germans in the Holocaust. In 1940, the Germans burned a synagogue, and in late 1944/early 1945, most of the village, together with the town hall, three bridges, and 18th century buildings, was burned by the Germans, who retreated on January 17, 1945.

Early years  Long was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Louis J. Long. She graduated from Eden Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1921. Dancer Florenz Ziegfeld insured Long for $100,000 against the possibility of her falling in love or marrying when she danced for his Ziegfeld Follies in the early 1920s. (Long later revealed that at that time she was already married with two children.) After performing with the Follies, Long appeared in the New York City comedy production of Scandals. Her rising popularity secured her a role in the cast of Kid Boots. Composer Milton Ager said Long was his inspiration for the song, I Wonder What's Become of Sally. Film star Long's first film experience came when Jesse Lasky secured fourteen of the prettiest women for parts in his The Dressmaker from Paris (1925). Produced by Famous Players, Long's character was noticed on the screen by filmmaker D.W. Griffith. Soon she appeared in a motion picture with Leatrice Joy. Rudolph Valentino picked Long to play the leading feminine role in The Hooded Falcon. However her contract with Valentino expired before the film was made. Valentino changed his mind about the movie he wished to make. He decided to do a motion picture which called for a blond feminine lead. In 1926, Long signed a five-year contract with A. H. Sebastian, Hollywood producer and executive head of Sebastian-Belasco Productions. Her first part with Sebastian was in Fifth Avenue (1926), playing a Greenwich Village girl. She next starred with Buck Jones in a Pathe Pictures production of the comedy, The Fighting Buckaroo (1926). She was selected as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars of 1926 along with Joan Crawford, Fay Wray, Mary Brian, Joyce Compton, and eight others. In 1927 she appeared in the serial King of the Jungle with Elmo Lincoln. Long's final screen appearances came in Cock o' the Walk (1930) and Traffic Tangle (1930). She studied voice beginning in 1932 with director Mitchell Leisen. Personal life Long married Leo Bovette Tuey in Kansas City in 1916, when she was fifteen years old. The couple had two children. Long divorced Tuey on January 19, 1926. She explained that she kept her marriage to Tuey a secret because it might have inhibited her career advancement. She resided for a time with her mother in a large Spanish home at 628 Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California. In August 1926 she moved to a cozier home in the Mexican Village a few blocks away, at 251 Crescent Drive. Long died in Newport Beach, California in 1987, aged 85.

Founded in 1988, the museum presents a wide range of exhibitions and public programs, including lectures, film, theater, festivals, family events, and music, and performs scholarship, research, and educational outreach. It has two sites and attracts about 150,000 visitors annually. In 2013, it extensively redesigned and renovated the Irene Helen Jones Parks Gallery of Art and the Gamble Firearms Gallery in its main building. In its related opening exhibit for the Parks Gallery, Art of the West, the new organization enabled material to be presented in relation to themes rather than chronology, and paintings were shown next to crafts, photography, video and other elements in new relationships. Locations The Autry Museum of the American West has two sites, about apart: *Griffith Park 4700 Western Heritage Way, Los Angeles, California, 90027 *Mt. Washington, 234 Museum Drive, Los Angeles, California, 90065 (Southwest Museum of the American Indian building and ethnobotanical garden, open on Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.) Elements The Autry was established in 1988 by actor and businessman Gene Autry as \\"Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum\\" to explore and share the comprehensive story of the American West and its multiple cultures and interpret its significance. Its Griffith Park collection includes 21,000 paintings, sculptures, costumes, textiles, firearms, tools, toys, musical instruments, and other objects. The museum presents contemporary and historical exhibitions, year-round programs for children, intellectual forums, and the Native Voices at the Autry performing arts series. Native Voices at the Autry Museum of the American West has been the only equity theater that has only focused on producing new works by Native American, Alaska Native, and First Nation playwrights since 1995. Randy Reinholz (member of Oklahoma‚Äôs Choctaw nation) and his wife Jean Bruce Scott have run this theater program that runs out of the Museum for 20 years. Native Voices has since been able to produce over 34 full productions, gone on over 20 tours, with 23 new play festivals and 13 Native playwrights. Native Voices is a crucial part of the Autry‚Äôs mission to promote art history and cultures of the American West. The museum is located in Griffith Park across from the Los Angeles Zoo. The 4,000-square foot Parks Gallery was renovated in 2013 and has been organized into three theme areas: Religion and Ritual, Land and Landscape, Migration and Movement, and also contains two mini galleries with revolving exhibits. This enables flexible curating of the museum's extensive materials: paintings can be placed near textiles, photographs, pottery and videos. The spaces can also be used for more flexible programming. The Gamble Firearms Gallery also was renovated in 2013. It now shows more of the context and place of firearms in the Old West; curators grouped firearms by themes: \\"hunting and trapping, the impact of technology on firearms, the conservation movement and the West in popular culture.\\" This is part of the Western Frontiers: Stories of Fact and Fiction Gallery. *The Autry's Southwest Museum of the American Indian Collection of Native American art is one of the most significant of its kind in the United States, second only to the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of the American Indian. The 238,000-piece collection includes 14,000 baskets, 10,000 ceramic items, 6,300 textiles and weavings, and more than 1,100 pieces of jewelry. It represents work by indigenous peoples from Alaska to South America, with an emphasis on cultures of California and the Southwestern United States. *The Autry Institute includes the collections of the Braun Research Library and the Autry Library. It is a research and publishing enterprise that produces and supports scholarly work in Western history and the arts. In 2002, the Women of the West Museum of Colorado merged with the Institute. This has broadened the scholarly and educational emphasis to include gender issues and women‚Äôs experiences in the American West.

The CRF concept have been created during the development of separation optimization, to compare the quality of many simulated or real chromatographic separations. Many CRFs have been proposed and discussed. In high performance liquid chromatography the CRF is calculated from various parameters of the peaks of solutes (like width, retention time, symmetry etc.) are considered into the calculation. In TLC the CRFs are based on the placement of the spots, measured as RF values.  Examples in thin layer chromatography  The CRFs in thin layer chromatography characterize the equal-spreading of the spots. The ideal case, when the RF of the spots are uniformly distributed in <0,1> range (for example 0.25,0.5 and 0.75 for three solutes) should be characterized as the best situation possible. The simplest criteria are \\\\Delta R_F and \\\\Delta R_F product (Wang et al., 1996). They are the smallest difference between sorted RF values, or product of such differences. Another function is the multispot response function (MRF) as developed by De Spiegeleer et al. It is based also of differences product. This function always lies between 0 and 1. When two RF values are equal, it is equal to 0, when all RF values are equal-spread, it is equal to 1. The L and U values ‚Äì upper and lower limit of RF ‚Äì give possibility to avoid the band region. MRF = \\\\frac {(U - hR_{Fn})(hR_{F1} - L)\\\\prod^{n-1}_{i=1}(hR_{Fi+1} - hR_{Fi})} {[(U - L)/(n+1)]^{n+1}} The last example of coefficient sensitive to minimal distance between spots is Retention distance (Komsta et al., 2007) R_D = \\\\Bigg[(n+1)^{(n+1)} \\\\prod^n_{i=0}{(R_{F(i+1)}-R_{Fi})\\\\Bigg]^{\\\\frac{1}{n}}} The second group are criteria insensitive for minimal difference between RF values (if two compounds are not separated, such CRF functions will not indicate it). They are equal to zero in equal-spread state increase when situation is getting worse.

Burnett played second base, third base, shortstop, and outfielder for the Cleveland Indians and St. Louis Browns. Born in Bartow, Florida, he made his major league debut for the Cleveland Indians at the age of 22 on May 7, 1927 against the Philadelphia Athletics after graduating from the University of Florida. Burnett wore uniform number 1 in all eight of his seasons with the Indians. In , Burnett's first season as an everyday starter, he was batting above .300 into July when, on July 19, he broke his wrist and was sidelined for the season. Without Burnett, the Indians narrowly missed the playoffs after finishing eight games above .500. On July 10, , still playing for the Indians, Burnett had a major league record nine hits in eleven at-bats in an eighteen inning game against the Philadelphia Athletics. Burnett's record for hits in a game still stands today. He was also the first man to have more than 7 hits in a game that went into extra innings. Since then, only Rocky Colavito in 1962, Cesar Gutierrez in 1970, Rennie Stennett in 1975, and Brandon Crawford in 2016 have collected 7 or more hits in 1 game. In late , in the waning years of his career, after eight seasons with the Indians, Burnett was traded by the Indians to the St. Louis Browns for outfielder Bruce Campbell. Wearing number 4, Burnett played only one season for the Browns before being traded to the Cincinnati Reds near the start of the season for first baseman Jim Bottomley. Burnett never played a game for the Reds, and never played major league baseball again. His last game was on September 29, .

It lies on the Bia≈Ça river, at the height of above sea level. The distance to Krak√≥w is , and to the border with Slovakia, approximately . The town is located on an electrified rail line from Tarn√≥w towards Nowy SƒÖcz and the Polish - Slovak border.  History  The first historical note about Tuch√≥w dates back to 1105. A document of papal legate Gilles de Paris tells us that the village had been given to the Tyniec Benedictine Abbey by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Herman‚Äôs wife. A prosperous salt mine operated here at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, which caused King Casimir III the Great to grant Magdeburg rights to Tuch√≥w in 1340. Polish writer Jan D≈Çugosz wrote in his Chronicles about the development of local artisan guilds: flourmills, carpenters, blacksmiths and furriers. By the 17th century, the town became rich by making profits from different crafts, salt exploitation and trade. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Tuch√≥w started to decline because of invasions by Swedish and Transilvanian armies (see Swedish invasion of Poland, fires and disease outbreaks. The railway connection between Tarn√≥w and Leluch√≥w was opened in the 19th century, which contributed to the economical revival of the town. In the 16th century, the cult of Holy Mary the Virgin was founded. News of miracles taking place in front of her picture spread quickly. Since that time hundreds of pilgrims come every year to the Sanctuary to worship her. Yearly celebrations take place in the first week of July. Tuch√≥w was seriously affected by the results of the World War I. There are a few cemeteries which remind of heavy battles that were fought in that area. However, during World War II, the town was saved and as a result, it started to develop gradually after 1945. Schools and a hospital were built as well as some small plants and housing estates. The town hall and the market square were renovated, and a ‚ÄúCulture Centre‚Äù with a sewage treatment plant were built. The gas pipe system and water lines were also laid. There are 6632 inhabitants in Tuch√≥w at present.  Geography  Administrative unit of Tuch√≥w is situated in Ciƒô≈ºkowice-Ro≈ºn√≥w part of the Carpathian Region, by which the river ‚ÄúBia≈Ça‚Äù flows. Such a location is very advantageous, just from Tarn√≥w and 100 from Krak√≥w. The arterial road of Lesser Poland Voivodeship, which links Tarn√≥w with Krynica, runs through the town. The picturesque scenery that surrounds Tuch√≥w appeared during the process of creating the Carpathian Mountains. There are beautiful hills with mild slopes. Brzanka is the highest hill in the area. It is one of the tourist attractions of the region. In 1990 Tuch√≥w celebrated its 650th anniversary of granting with town rights, which was a good occasion to open a tourist route around the town ( long). There are also farms that offer accommodation for tourists.

The center was the first LSD-based meditation center in Manhattan.Santa Cruz Sentinel. \\"Remembrances\\", 02 January, 2000  Origins  Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert were psychedelic researchers at Harvard University in the Psychology Department during the early 1960s.Staton, Scott. ‚ÄúTurn On, Tune In, Drop by the Archives: Timothy Leary at the N.Y.P.L.\\", The New Yorker, 11 June 2011Hiatt, Nathaniel J. ‚ÄúA Trip Down Memory Lane: LSD at Harvard\\", Harvard Crimson, 23 May 2016 In 1962 Leary set up a grassroots nonprofit group with Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) called the International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF), in order to carry out studies in the religious use of psychedelic drugs.Timothy Leary Archives. ‚ÄúInternational Federation For Internal Freedom ‚Äì Statement of Purpose\\" IFIF was subsequently disbanded and renamed the Castalia Foundation (after the intellectual colony in Herman Hesse's The Glass Bead Game), when Leary and Alpert set up a communal group in 1963 at the Hitchcock Estate in Millbrook, New York.Chevallier, Jim. ‚ÄúTim Leary and Ovum - A Visit to Castalia with Ovum\\", Chez Jim/Ovum, 03 March 2003Ulrich, Jennifer. ‚ÄúTransmissions from The Timothy Leary Papers: Hesse, Gurdjieff and Minor White\\", New York Public Library, 14 May 2012 Leary and Alpert lived and worked at the Millbrook estate with a small group devoted to the exploration of consciousness-expanding drugs.Junker, Howard. ‚ÄúLSD: ‚ÄòThe Contact High‚Äô\\", The Nation, 05 July, 1965 The group's journal was the Psychedelic Review. The Castalia Foundation hosted weekend retreats on the estate where people paid to undergo the psychedelic experience without drugs, through meditation, yoga, and group therapy sessions. The Castalia Foundation adopted some of the mystic teachings of Gurjieff for their non-drug workshops. During 1965 Castalia Foundation members collaborated with artists, including the media art collective USCO (The Company of US), to reproduce the LSD experience in improvised audio-visual psychedelic shows in Manhattan.Ulrich, Jennifer. ‚ÄúTransmissions from The Timothy Leary Papers: Evolution of the \\"Psychedelic\\" Show\\", New York Public Library, 04 June, 2012 The origins of the League for Spiritual Discovery can also be found in the Original Kleptonian Neo-American Church, whose clergy members administered sacraments in the form of psychedelic drugs. The church was founded in 1965 by Arthur Kleps, a participant in Leary's circle at Millbrook. The Millbrook residents were a tight-knit group whose goal was to discover and cultivate the divinity within each person, and they regularly took high doses of LSD in group sessions. Leary was arrested in December 1965 for possession of marijuana.Harvard Crimson. ‚ÄúLeary Arrested On Drug Charge\\", Harvard Crimson, 3 January 1966  History  On September 19, 1966, Leary reorganized the IFIF/Castalia Foundation under the nomenclature of the League for Spiritual Discovery, a religion with LSD as its holy sacrament. By doing this, he hoped to legalize LSD based on a \\"freedom of religion\\" argument.San Francisco Chronicle September 20, 1966 Page One They were influenced by the Native American Church's historical peyote use. The League for Spiritual Discovery was incorporated by Leary as a religious organization in New York State.Linder, Douglas O. ‚ÄúTestimony of Timothy F. Leary\\", Famous Trials Leary's goal was to create a new concept of religion based on his communal experiences at Millbrook, in which people with shared spiritual goals came together to expand consciousness. The organization was also referred to as the League of Spiritual Discovery. Anyone at Millbrook could read publications such as Leary's Psychedelic Prayers (a book of poems inspired by the Tao Te Ching meant to be used as an aid to LSD trips), and underground newspapers to which the group subscribed. The League for Spiritual Discovery's belief structure was based on Leary's mantra: \\"drop out, turn on, tune in.\\" Though the more popular \\"turn on, tune in, drop out\\" became synonymous with Leary, his actual definition was: \\"Drop Out ‚Äì detach yourself from the external social drama which is as dehydrated and ersatz as TV. Turn On ‚Äì find a sacrament which returns you to the temple of God, your own body. Go out of your mind. Get high. Tune In ‚Äì be reborn. Drop back in to express it. Start a new sequence of behavior that reflects your vision.\\" Although The Brotherhood of Eternal Love would subsequently consider Leary their spiritual leader, The Brotherhood did not evolve out of the League for Spiritual Discovery. The motto of the group, \\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\\" became synonymous with the sixties. Nicholas Sand, the clandestine chemist for the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, followed Leary to Millbrook and joined the League for Spiritual Discovery. Sand was designated the \\"alchemist\\" of the new religion.Grimesmay, William. ‚ÄúChemist Who Sought to Bring LSD to the World, Dies at 75\\", New York Times, 12 May 2017 Owsley Stanley encouraged Sand to shift his operations to California, and offered him the services of his lab partner, Tim Scully. There Sand and Scully manufactured Orange Sunshine LSD - their history is documented in the documentary The Sunshine Makers. On October 6, 1966, LSD was made illegal in the state of California. Later, on October 24, 1968, LSD was added to the list of Schedule 1 substances, which made it illegal to possess, manufacture, or use for any purpose in the United States.Jarnow, Jesse. ‚ÄúLSD Now: How the Psychedelic Renaissance Changed Acid\\", Rolling Stone, 06 October, 2016Johnson, Lyndon B. \\"Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Relating to Traffic in or Possession of Drugs Such as LSD\\", 25 October 1968. Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project. At the end of 1966, Nina Graboi, a friend and colleague of Leary's who had spent time with him at Millbrook, became the director of the Center for the League of Spiritual Discovery in Greenwich Village. The Center opened in March 1967. Graboi explained \\"The League of Spiritual Discovery had only two commandments: Thou shalt not alter the consciousness of thy fellow man, and Thou shalt not prevent thy fellow man from altering his own consciousness.\\" Graboi accepted the position as director to disseminate information about the use and misuse of psychedelics, in order to minimize their ill effects. Leary thought their work together could educate people about the constructive use of LSD, as well as serve as a rescue center. Leary and Alpert gave free weekly talks at the center, and other guest speakers included Ralph Metzner and Allen Ginsberg. During late 1966 and early 1967, Leary toured college campuses to spread the psychedelic gospel by presenting a multi-media performance called \\"The Death of the Mind\\" which attempted to artistically replicate the LSD experience. It had initially opened at a theater that became the location for the Fillmore East. Leary said the League for Spiritual Discovery was limited to 360 members and was already at its membership limit, but he encouraged others to form their own psychedelic religions. He published a pamphlet in 1967 called Start Your Own Religion to encourage people to do so. At the end of 1967, Leary was evicted from the Millbrook estate, and shortly thereafter moved to Laguna Beach, California after Rosemary Leary became his third wife. He was arrested on December 26, 1968 in Laguna Beach for possession of marijuana. In 1970, Leary received a ten-year sentence for the marijuana arrest. He escaped from prison with help from the Weather Underground and Black Panthers, but was arrested again in 1973. He was released from prison in 1976.Menand, Louis. ‚ÄúAcid Redux: The life and high times of Timothy Leary\\", New Yorker, 26 June 2006 Around end of 1967/early 1968 the League for Spiritual Discovery was closed down, and the New York Center for the League of Spiritual Discovery was abandoned shortly after Graboi left her position as director. Leary's papers at the New York Public Library include complete records of the International Federation for Internal Freedom, the Castalia Foundation, and the League for Spiritual Discovery.  Revival  In October 2006, the League for Spiritual Discovery was restarted, taking all of the original intents of the prior organization as a foundation, but updating the message and expanding the work.

Under previous kings The members of the Protestant religion in France, the Huguenots, had been granted substantial religious, political and military freedom by Henry IV in his Edict of Nantes. Later, following renewed warfare, they were stripped of their political and military privileges by Louis XIII, but retained their religious freedoms. This situation persisted until the personal rule of Louis XIV. Initially he sought to convert Protestants to Catholicism through peaceful means, including financial incentives, but gradually he adopted harsher measures, culminating in the use of dragonnades, soldiers stationed in the homes of Protestants to force them to convert. In 1685, he revoked the Edict of Nantes altogether, abolishing all rights of Protestants in the kingdom. Under this duress, many Protestants converted to Catholicism; others fled the country. Those who converted, however, usually did so only outwardly as crypto-Protestants, also called Nicodemites. As soon as the vigilance of the government was relaxed they neglected the service of the Catholic Church, and, when they dared, they met in their houses or in the open for the worship of their own faith.Perkins, p. 65. In truth, the number of Protestants who truly became Catholics and passed on their faith to their children was insignificant. The penalties for preaching or attending a Protestant assembly were severe: life terms in the galleys for men, imprisonment for women, and confiscation of all property were common. Beginning in 1702, a group of Protestants in the region of the C√©vennes mountains, known as Camisards, revolted against the government. Fighting largely ceased after 1704, only to resume in 1710 and continue sporadically for the next five years. Protestantism continued to be suppressed in France until the death of Louis XIV in 1715.  Under Louis XV  As Louis XV was only 5 years old when he became king, France came under the rule of a regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans (in office: 1715-1723). The Regent had little interest in continuing the persecution of Protestants. While the kingdom's laws did not change, their application diminished. Protestants began once more to celebrate their religion, especially in regions such as Languedoc, the Dauphin√©, Guyenne, and Poitou.Lavisse p. 84. Nevertheless, there remained those who advocated rigor in the treatment of the Protestants. Prominent among these, the Archbishop of Rouen, Louis III de La Vergne de Tressan, became the grand almoner to the Regent. He argued with both the Regent and the most influential minister, Cardinal Dubois, in favour of severe measures against the Protestants. They rejected his ideas. After Louis Henri, Duc de Bourbon became premier in 1723, however, the bishop found in him a more receptive audience, and he was given permission to draw up a general law against \\"l'h√©r√©sie\\". The King promulgated a law on 14 May 1724: > Of all the grand designs of our most honoured lord and great-grandfather, > there is none that we have more at heart to carry out than that which he > conceived, of entirely extinguishing heresy in his kingdom. Arrived at > majority, our first care has been to have before us the edicts whereof > execution has been delayed, especially in the provinces afflicted with the > contagion. We have observed that the chief abuses which demand a speedy > remedy relate to illicit assemblies, the education of children, the > obligation of public functionaries to profess the Catholic religion, the > penalties against the relapsed, and the celebration of marriage, regarding > which here are our intentions: Shall be condemned: preachers to the penalty > of death, their accomplices to the galleys for life, and women to be shaved > and imprisoned for life. Confiscation of property: parents who shall not > have baptism administered to their children within twenty-four hours, and > see that they attend regularly the catechism and the schools, to fines and > such sums as they may amount to together; even to greater penalties. > Midwives, physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, domestics, relatives, who > shall not notify the parish priests of births or illnesses, to fines. > Persons who shall exhort the sick, to the galleys or imprisonment for life, > according to sex; confiscation of property. The sick who shall refuse the > sacraments, if they recover, to banishment for life; if they die, to be > dragged on a hurdle. Desert-marriages are illegal; the children born of them > are incompetent to inherit. Minors whose parents are expatriated may marry > without their authority; but parents whose children are on foreign soil > shall not consent to their marriage, on pain of the galleys for the men and > banishment for the women. Finally, of all fines and confiscations, half > shall be employed in providing subsistence for the new converts.In Guizot, > p. 54. The law equalled, and even surpassed in some measures, the most severe proclamations of Louis XIV. However, times had changed. Louis XIV's decrees against the Protestants had been greeted by the majority of the country with enthusiasm. But the clergy had not sought the 1724 edict; it was \\"the work of an ambitious man [Tressan] backed up by certain fanatics\\". The magistrates, too, were not as enthusiastic as the public in their application of the edict.Guizot, p. 55. Serious discrimination took place only where the local authorities were strict and loyal to the edict. It mostly occurred in southern France, especially in the dioceses of N√Æmes and Uz√®s, and in Dauphin√©.Lavisse, p. 86. Protestant preachers and/or leaders active during this period in France included Antoine Court,Guizot, pp. 52‚Äì53, 56.Perkins, pp. 65-7. Paul Rabaut,Guizot, p. 56. Alexander Ramsey, and Roger.Perkins, p. 73. They often lived as nomads in wilderness areas in order to avoid capture. Historians estimate that the number of men and women imprisoned or sent to the galleys for religious offences in the 40 years following the edict of 1724 was almost two thousand.Perkins, p. 74. According to Antoine Court, eight ministers were executed in this period.Perkins, p. 72-3. Note 1.- List given by Antoine Court, Le patriote fran√ßais. This was a much lower rate than had occurred during the later part of Louis XIV's reign.Perkins pp. 73‚Äì4; the source for much of his data on numbers of prisoners is Coquerel. Toulon was the centre where most of the men committed to the galleys for religious crimes served their sentences.Perkins, p. 74. Letters of one of its inmates and the accounts of witnesses such as Marie Durand tell of the dreary and desolate women's prison, the Tower of Constance at Aigues Mortes.Perkins, pp. 75-8. Through the efforts of the Prince of Beauvau, the dozen or so women held there were finally released in 1767.Perkins, pp. 75-8. Concerning the Prince de Beauvau's rescue efforts, he quotes a description by the Chevalier of Boufflers in Coquerel. He cites Coquerel, Histoire des √©glises du d√©sert in connexion with the Hugenots generally, but it is not entirely clear whether this is the work containing the Boufflers quote. In the decades following 1724, enthusiasm for the persecution of Protestants continued to wane; after 1764 they \\"enjoyed a practical toleration for a quarter of a century before the law secured them a legal toleration\\"Perkins, p. 78. by the Edict of Versailles in 1787.

O'Byrne). Plot and characters The story is set in present-day England and involves three main characters: a serial killer named Ralph Wantage, who kidnaps and murders a young girl; the murdered girl's mother, Nancy Shirley; a New York psychiatrist, Agnetha Gottmundsdottir, who travels to England to examine Ralph. The three lives slowly intersect -- and the characters gradually change and become \\"unfrozen\\" as they come to terms with the idea of forgiveness. The script begins in monologues, each person showing his or her side of the story; the audience sees each person's story intertwine as they connect with one another. Allegations of plagiarism In September 2004, media sources around the world (including The Times, The Observer, The New York Times, and the Associated Press) reported allegations that Lavery had plagiarized significant portions (nearly 675 words) of the play from a 1997 The New Yorker article by Malcolm Gladwell about psychiatrist Dorothy Lewis, and from Lewis' own book Guilty by Reason of Insanity (1998). Lewis claimed that Frozen was based in large part on her life and that the play lifted both themes and verbatim passages from both sources. However, after interviewing Lavery, Gladwell wrote a second New Yorker article in which he characterized Lavery's appropriation as \\"permissible borrowing.\\" Lavery, for her part, acknowledged that all three characters were drawn heavily from external sources. For the character of Ralph, she drew on the book The Murder of Childhood by Ray Wyre and Tim Tate. For the character of Nancy, she drew on an article in The Guardian by Marian Partington, whose sister Lucy had been murdered by the serial killers Fred and Rosemary West. And, for the character of Agnetha, Lavery drew on the Gladwell article. \\"I wanted [the play] to be accurate\\", she told Gladwell.Gladwell - Something Borrowed Nov 2004 Reviews *\\"[A] big, brave, compassionate play about grief, revenge, forgiveness and bearing the unbearable.\\" -- The Guardian The TalkinBroadway reviewer of a Florida production wrote: \\"[A] powerful drama ... about three people living the human condition... a story that needs to continue to be told.\\" NotesReferences *Malcolm Gladwell, \\"\\"Damaged\\"\\", The New Yorker, February 24, 1997 *Tony-nominated playwright Bryony Lavery accused of plagiarism, Associated Press, September 25, 2004 *Jesse McKinley, Playwright Created a Psychiatrist By Plagiarizing One, Accusers Say, New York Times, September 25, 2004, Page B-1 *Malcolm Gladwell, Something Borrowed: Should a charge of plagiarism ruin your life?, The New Yorker, November 22, 2004 External links 2004 plays British plays Works involved in plagiarism controversies ","title":"Frozen (play)"},{"id":"9615090","text":"Old-timer or oldtimer may refer to: * A veteran * Someone in old age * Oldtimer (in German, Dutch and Hungarian), an antique or classic car, or vintage aircraft ** Oldtimer Grand Prix * A specialized class of free flight model aircraft, for designs initially designed and flown before 1942's end * An eggcorn for someone with Alzheimer's disease *Oldtimers (Pern), a group of dragonriders in the fantasy fiction series Dragonriders of Pern * The Oldtimers, a 1974-75 Canadian television series *A brand of knives manufactured by Imperial Schrade See also *Old-Timers' Day, a US baseball tradition ","title":"Old-timer"},{"id":"9615094","text":"LibiƒÖ≈º is a town in Chrzan√≥w County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, Poland, with 17,671 inhabitants (2004).

After the Confederates fled, Kitchen quickly left Berkeley County and returned to the congressional session in Washington, DC. This incident was later cited by the House Committee of Elections as evidence of the wartime conditions found in Berkeley County and other border counties in the 7th District. These conditions were attributed to disrupting the election process in the area.(The Congressional Globe, 38th Congress, 1st Session, page 850) http://memory.loc.gov/cgi- bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName;=064/llcg064.db&recNum;=921 On October 1, 1864, Kitchen chaired a Union meeting at Martinsburg, West Virginia.

Doc. 12, 38th Congress, 1st Session. https://books.google.com/books?id=0_JUAAAAcAAJ& In December 1863, Kitchen presented his credentials as a member-elect to the 38th United States Congress. When Congress convened on December 7, no representatives from Virginia were present at roll call.(The Congressional Globe, 38th Congress, 1st Session, page 4) http://memory.loc.gov/cgi- bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName;=064/llcg064.db&recNum;=75 On December 23, 1863, runner-up Lewis McKenzie contested the election on the grounds that a majority (730) of Kitchen's votes had come from Berkeley County, Virginia, which simultaneously voted to join the new state of West Virginia on May 28, 1863. In the other counties that remained in the 7th District, Kitchen only received 232 votes.(The Congressional Globe, 38th Congress, 1st Session, pages 847-850) http://memory.loc.gov/cgi- bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName;=064/llcg064.db&recNum;=918 McKenzie argued that Berkeley County votes should be ineligible in Virginia's 7th District election because Berkeley County was no longer in the 7th District or the state of Virginia. McKenzie also alleged misconduct in reporting Berkeley County's election results. Since the Berkeley County clerk's office had been vacated due to the war, Berkeley County polling commissioners had instead reported election results to the county clerk in Alexandria, Virginia, the seat of the Restored Government of Virginia. On February 8, 1864, the House Committee of Elections, led by Henry L. Dawes, presented a report and two resolutions declaring that neither McKenzie nor Kitchen were entitled to a seat. Green Clay Smith presented a minority report.(The Congressional Globe, 38th Congress, 1st Session, page 526) http://memory.loc.gov/cgi- bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName;=064/llcg064.db&recNum;=597 On February 26, 1864, McKenzie presented his case.(The Congressional Globe, 38th Congress, 1st Session, pages 847-848) http://memory.loc.gov/cgi- bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName;=064/llcg064.db&recNum;=918 Dawes discredited McKenzie's claims regarding the legitimacy of the Berkeley County election and irregularities in the reporting process. Berkeley County's participation in the Virginia election was ruled valid, due to West Virginia not fully accepting Berkeley County's admittance until August 5, 1863, more than two months after the May 28 election.(The Congressional Globe, 38th Congress, 1st Session, page 849) http://memory.loc.gov/cgi- bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName;=064/llcg064.db&recNum;=920 The House passed the resolution that Lewis McKenzie was not entitled to the seat under any circumstances due to lack of votes. Dawes presented the committee's reasons for the resolution against Kitchen's eligibility as well. Green Clay Smith asked for the resolution to be struck out. The majority report declared that voting in most 7th District counties had been disrupted so badly by the war that many citizens had not been able to vote. Due to the lack of consistent voting throughout the district, the report concluded that the seat should remain vacant as no candidate could be determined to represent the choice of the majority of the district. On April 16, 1864, Green Clay Smith presented a minority report in defense of Kitchen's eligibility. Smith noted other elections with lower percentages of voter turnout. He cited a lack of evidence that citizens were prevented from voting, and the difficulty in determining why citizens failed to vote. Finally, Smith reasoned that it was not moral to deny representation for the citizens who did vote under wartime conditions, and the majority of votes cast were for Kitchen.(The Congressional Globe, 38th Congress, 1st Session pages 1673-1677) http://memory.loc.gov/cgi- bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName;=065/llcg065.db&recNum;=698 Dawes countered this report with statements Kitchen had given regarding entire counties that had been under rebel control and did not hold elections. Dawes also noted that while Berkeley County had legally been part of Virginia on the day of the election, the county was in the process of being transferred to West Virginia and its votes for Kitchen did not represent the majority of Virginia's 7th District.(The Congressional Globe, 38th Congress, 1st Session pages 1676-1678) http://memory.loc.gov/cgi- bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName;=065/llcg065.db&recNum;=701 Therefore, the House passed the committee's resolution that Kitchen was not entitled to a seat, but also dismissed McKenzie's claim.

It originated in the later half of the 17th century in the southern part of Spain. The seis is influenced by Spanish, African, and Taino cultures. The Arabian aspects come from Spain, where the Muslims or the Moors had ruled for over 700 years. Like other Jibaro music, the seis is associated with Christmas, folkloric festivals, concursos de trovadores (poetry-singing contests), and other large celebrations. The word means six, which may have come from the custom of having six couples perform the dance, though many more couples eventually became quite common. Men and women form separate lines down the hall or in an open place of beaten earth, one group facing the other. The lines would approach and cross each other and at prescribed intervals the dancers would tap out the rhythm with their feet. Instruments The seis was made for a solo voice and accompanying instruments. The melodies and harmonies are simple, usually performed on the cuatro, guitar, bongo, and g√ºiro, although other indigenous instruments are used depending on the available musicians. Spanish instrumentation and harmonies, typically from the Andalusian region, are prominent. In the 20th century, Afro-Caribbean aspects were included through the bongo, syncopated bass, and Cuban rhythms. These were especially used in studio recordings. There are different variations of the seis named after towns where they originated from (ex: seis fajarde√±o or seis de Fajardo), their composers (ex: seis de Andino), the specific dance style (ex: seis chorreao), harmonic style (ex: seis mapay√©), and type of text, which is often improvised (ex: seis con d√©cima). The seis con d√©cima is one of the types that is not danced to and it‚Äôs the slowest. The seis mapay√© or le lo lai is always in minor and the lyrics are about nostalgia. Each variation has its own musical tonality and key (major or minor), making it sound happy or sad. Lyrics Since the 19th century, the lyrics are about migration, urbanization, love, patriotism, sociopolitics, maternal devotion, and other topics. Migration is an important part as a massive wave of Puerto Ricans migrated to the United States between the 20s and 50s. These massive migrations started after the American invasion in Puerto Rico when the economy changed from agriculturally based to industrially based, leaving many Puerto Ricans without jobs on the island. The Puerto Rican government encouraged the Puerto Ricans to migrate, especially after World War II. Most Puerto Ricans dwelled in New York, where Puerto Rican music was played at social clubs, especially Jibaro music.

It is indicated for the treatment of infection by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia in immunocompetent individuals and has been repurposed for the treatment of influenza. Nitazoxanide has also been shown to have in vitro antiparasitic activity and clinical treatment efficacy for infections caused by other protozoa and helminths; emerging evidence suggests that it possesses efficacy in treating a number of viral infections as well. Chemically, nitazoxanide is the prototype member of the thiazolides, a class of drugs which are synthetic nitrothiazolyl-salicylamide derivatives with antiparasitic and antiviral activity. Tizoxanide, an active metabolite of nitazoxanide in humans, is also an antiparasitic drug of the thiazolide class. Uses Nitazoxanide is an effective first-line treatment for infection by Blastocystis species and is indicated for the treatment of infection by Cryptosporidium parvum or Giardia lamblia in immunocompetent adults and children. It is also an effective treatment option for infections caused by other protozoa and helminths (e.g., Entamoeba histolytica, Hymenolepis nana, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Cyclospora cayetanensis). , it is in phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment influenza due to its inhibitory effect on a broad range of influenza virus subtypes and efficacy against influenza viruses that are resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors like oseltamivir. Figure 1: Molecular targets and potential antiviral treatments against influenza virus infection Nitazoxanide is also being researched as a potential treatment for chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, rotavirus and norovirus gastroenteritis. Chronic hepatitis B Nitazoxanide alone has shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B over a one-year course of therapy. Nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily resulted in a decrease in serum HBV DNA in all of 4 HBeAg-positive patients, with undetectable HBV DNA in 2 of 4 patients, loss of HBeAg in 3 patients, and loss of HBsAg in one patient. Seven of 8 HBeAg-negative patients treated with nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily had undetectable HBV DNA and 2 had loss of HBsAg. Additionally, nitazoxanide monotherapy in one case and nitazoxanide plus adefovir in another case resulted in undetectable HBV DNA, loss of HBeAg and loss of HBsAg. These preliminary studies showed a higher rate of HBsAg loss than any currently licensed therapy for chronic hepatitis B. The similar mechanism of action of interferon and nitazoxanide suggest that stand-alone nitazoxanide therapy or nitazoxanide in concert with nucleos(t)ide analogs have the potential to increase loss of HBsAg, which is the ultimate end-point of therapy. A formal phase ‚Ö° study is being planned for 2009.World Journal of Gastroenterology 2009 April 21, Emmet B Keeffe MD, Professor, Jean-Fran√ßois Rossignol The Romark Institute for Medical Research, Tampa Chronic hepatitis C Romark initially decided to focus on the possibility of treating chronic hepatitis C with nitazoxanide. The drug garnered interest from the hepatology community after three phase II clinical trials involving the treatment of hepatitis C with nitazoxanide produced positive results for treatment efficacy and similar tolerability to placebo without any signs of toxicity. A meta-analysis from 2014 concluded that the previous held trials were of low-quality and with held with a risk of bias. The authors concluded that more randomized trials with low risk of bias are needed to determine if Nitazoxanide can be used as an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis C patients. Clinical trials Romark Laboratories has announced encouraging results from international Phase I and II clinical trials evaluating a controlled release version of nitazoxanide in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The company used 675 mg and 1,350 mg twice daily doses of controlled release nitazoxanide showed favorable safety and tolerability throughout the course of the study, with mild to moderate adverse events. Primarily GI-related adverse events were reported. Nitazoxanide has gone through Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of hepatitis C, in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin. A randomised double- blind placebo-controlled study published in 2006, with a group of 38 young children (Lancet, vol 368, page 124-129) concluded that a 3-day course of nitazoxanide significantly reduced the duration of rotavirus disease in hospitalized pediatric patients. Dose given was \\"7.5 mg/kg twice daily\\" and the time of resolution was \\"31 hours for those given nitazoxanide compared with 75 hours for those in the placebo group.\\" Rotavirus is the most common infectious agent associated with diarrhea in the pediatric age group worldwide. Teran et al.. conducted a study at the Pediatric Center Albina Patin√∂, a reference hospital in the city of Cochabamba, Bolivia, from August 2007 to February 2008. The study compared nitazoxanide and probiotics in the treatment of acute rotavirus diarrhea. They found small differences in favor of nitazoxanide in comparison with probiotics and concluded that nitazoxanide is an important treatment option for rotavirus diarrhea. Lateef et al.. conducted a study in India that evaluated the effectiveness of nitazoxanide in the treatment of beef tapeworm (Taenia saginata) infection. They concluded that nitazoxanide is a safe, effective, inexpensive, and well-tolerated drug for the treatment of niclosamide- and praziquantel-resistant beef tapeworm (Taenia saginata) infection. A retrospective review of charts of patients treated with nitazoxanide for trichomoniasis by Michael Dan and Jack D. Sobel demonstrated a negative result. They reported three case studies; two of which with metronidazole-resistant infections. In Case 3, they reported the patient to be cured with high divided dose tinidazole therapy. They used a higher dosage of the drug (total dose, 14‚Äì56 g) than the recommended standard dosage (total dose, 3 g) and observed a significant adverse reaction (poorly tolerated nausea) only with the very high dose (total dose, 56 g). While confirming the safety of the drug, they showed nitazoxanide is ineffective for the treatment of trichomoniasis. Contraindications Nitazoxanide is contraindicated only in individuals who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to nitazoxanide or the inactive ingredients of a nitazoxanide formulation. Adverse effects The side effects of nitazoxanide do not significantly differ from a placebo treatment for giardiasis; these symptoms include stomach pain, headache, upset stomach, vomiting, discolored urine, excessive urinating, skin rash, itching, fever, flu syndrome, and others. Nitazoxanide does not appear to cause any significant adverse effects when taken by healthy adults. Overdose Information on nitazoxanide overdose is limited. Oral doses of 4 grams in healthy adults do not appear to cause any significant adverse effects. In various animals, the oral LD50 is higher than 10 . Interactions Due to the exceptionally high plasma protein binding (>99.9%) of nitazoxanide's metabolite, tizoxanide, the concurrent use of nitazoxanide with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices (e.g., warfarin) increases the risk of drug toxicity. In vitro evidence suggests that nitazoxanide does not affect the CYP450 system. Pharmacology=Pharmacodynamics The anti-protozoal activity of nitazoxanide is believed to be due to interference with the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction which is essential to anaerobic energy metabolism. PFOR inhibition may also contribute to its activity against anaerobic bacteria. It has also been shown to have activity against influenza A virus in vitro. The mechanism appears to be by selectively blocking the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin at a stage preceding resistance to endoglycosidase H digestion. This impairs hemagglutinin intracellular trafficking and insertion of the protein into the host plasma membrane. Nitazoxanide modulates a variety of other pathways in vitro, including glutathione-S-transferase and glutamate- gated chloride ion channels in nematodes, respiration and other pathways in bacteria and cancer cells, and viral and host transcriptional factors. Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration, nitazoxanide is rapidly hydrolyzed to the pharmacologically active metabolite, tizoxanide, which is 99% protein bound. Tizoxanide is then glucuronide conjugated into the active metabolite, tizoxanide glucuronide. Peak plasma concentrations of the metabolites tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are observed 1‚Äì4 hours after oral administration of nitazoxanide, whereas nitazoxanide itself is not detected in blood plasma. Roughly of an oral dose of nitazoxanide is excreted as its metabolites in feces, while the remainder of the dose excreted in urine. Tizoxanide is excreted in the urine, bile and feces. Tizoxanide glucuronide is excreted in urine and bile.  Chemistry  Nitazoxanide is the prototype member of the thiazolides, which is a drug class of structurally- related broad-spectrum antiparasitic compounds. Nitazoxanide is a light yellow crystalline powder. It is poorly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in water.  History  Nitazoxanide was originally discovered in the 1980s by Jean-Fran√ßois Rossignol at the Pasteur Institute. Initial studies demonstrated activity versus tapeworms. In vitro studies demonstrated much broader activity. Dr. Rossignol co-founded Romark Laboratories, with the goal of bringing nitazoxanide to market as an anti-parasitic drug. Initial studies in the USA were conducted in collaboration with Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Marietta, GA) and focused on development of the drug for treatment of cryptosporidiosis in AIDS. Controlled trials began shortly after the advent of effective anti-retroviral therapies. The trials were abandoned due to poor enrollment and the FDA rejected an application based on uncontrolled studies. Subsequently, Romark launched a series of controlled trials. A placebo- controlled study of nitazoxanide in cryptosporidiosis demonstrated significant clinical improvement in adults and children with mild illness. Among malnourished children in Zambia with chronic cryptosporidiosis, a three-day course of therapy led to clinical and parasitologic improvement and improved survival. In Zambia and in a study conducted in Mexico, nitazoxanide was not successful in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in advanced infection with human immunodeficiency virus at the doses used. However, it was effective in patients with higher CD4 counts. In treatment of giardiasis, nitazoxanide was superior to placebo and comparable to metronidazole. Nitazoxanide was successful in the treatment of metronidazole-resistant giardiasis. Studies have suggested efficacy in the treatment of cyclosporiasis, isosporiasis, and amebiasis. Recent studies have also found it to be effective against beef tapeworm(Taenia saginata). Nitazoxanide is also under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19. Nitazoxanide showed moderate to high inhibitory efficacy against COVID-19 PL protease as demonstrated by in silico study. Pharmaceutical products=Dosage forms Nitazoxanide is currently available in two oral dosage forms: a tablet (500 mg) and an oral suspension (100 mg per 5 ml when reconstituted). An extended release tablet (675 mg) has been used in clinical trials for chronic hepatitis C; however, this form is not currently marketed and available for prescription.

John William Dowling (May 13, 1807 Pavensey, Sussex, England - July 4, 1878 Middletown, New York) was an American Baptist minister, the author of The History of Romanism: from the Earliest Corruptions of Christianity to the Present Time.  Personal life  In an irregular way he acquired a classical education, and became a tutor in a classical institution in London in 1826. Three years later he established a boarding-school a few miles from Oxford, where he taught until 1832. In that year he emigrated to New York City with his wife and two children and united with the Baptist church in Catskill, New York, where he was ordained. At this time the cholera was raging as an epidemic. Having left his family in New York City to pay a flying visit to Catskill, he returned to find his wife and one of his children dead from this dreadful disease -- already in their coffins, prepared for burial. Overwhelmed with grief, he returned with his remaining child to Catskill, where he became the pastor of the Baptist Church of that place. While laboring here he met and married Maria S. Perkins, daughter of a prominent gentleman of that town, and who bore him a son.  Career  He held pastorates in New York, Philadelphia, Providence and Newport, R. I. Upon leaving Catskill he accepted a call to the Tabernacle Baptist Church, of New York. Here he remained for several years, during which time his son was born. From here he removed to Providence, R. I., to become the pastor of the First Baptist Church of that town. During his labors in Providence the degree of Master of Arts was conferred upon him by the Trustees of Brown University. From here he removed to New York city, where he labored not only as a pastor, but as a powerful opponent of the Roman Catholic Church. Having enjoyed a liberal college education in his own country, he became a formidable opponent, and entered the list in public discussion with the renowned Archbishop Hughes, at the same time penning the History of Romanism, which went through multiple editions. On leaving New York he removed to Philadelphia, succeeding the celebrated Dr. StoughtonPresumably, William Staughton who retired in 1822 as pastor of the Sansom Street Baptist Church. Here he was as popular as elsewhere, ministering to one of the largest congregations in the city, and maintaining his high position as a leader in the Baptist denomination. He once more returned to New York, where he again officiated in his holy calling, though with less demonstration. As of 1873 he was sixty-five years of age and in the enjoyment of good health. His son by his second wife grew up to become a doctor.  Works  His published works include: * Vindication of the Baptists (New York) * Exposition of the Prophecies (1840) * Defence of the Protestant Scriptures (1843) * History of Romanism (1845), of which 30,000 copies were sold in less than ten years * Power of Illustration * Nights and Mornings * Judson Offering He edited a Conference hymn-book (1868), Noel's work on Baptism, the works of Lorenzo Dow, Conyer's Middleton, on the Conformity of Popery and Paganism, Memoir of the Missionary Jacob Thomas; and a translation from the French of Cote's work on Romanism.

Kingstanding ward includes the areas; Perry Common, Witton Lakes and Wyrley Birch. The other part of Kingstanding falls under the Oscott ward. Kingstanding houses a covered drinking water reservoir, Perry Barr Reservoir, on the site of the former Perry Barr Farm. Kingstanding is served by two libraries; Kingstanding Library and Perry Common Library. The area known as Kingstanding Circle is the where the Kingstanding village centre lies with its shops and Kings Road/ Kingstanding Road roundabout. History The name of the area is derived from the occasion when the Stuart King Charles I supposedly reviewed his troops standing on the Neolithic Bowl Barrow in the area on 18 October 1642 during the English Civil War, after his stay at nearby Aston Hall. The first references to Kingstanding were as King's Standing. The course of the Icknield Street Roman Road runs past this barrow; and when the foundations for the water pumping station were being dug in 1884, a hoard of Roman coins was discovered. Warren Farm Estate in 1929.The area was largely rural until the 1928, when large-scale residential development commenced in the area. The first of the estates was completed in 1934. It was during the 1930s and 1940s that most of the current housing was built. Most of the houses in Kingstanding were built as council houses with the majority being located in the north of the area. At the time, it was the largest council housing development in Europe, containing some 6,700 properties on its completion. In 1935, an Odeon cinema, designed by Cecil Clavering, was opened on Kingstanding Circle. On 6 June 1964, Kingstanding Library opened. It had an area of and was identified as being liable to mining subsidence. Kingstanding is featured in the novel The Last Viking by Dr Ron Dawson. The author grew up at number 79 Parkeston Crescent, and used the estate and its many characters as the backcloth to his Birmingham-based novel. Politics The Kingstanding ward was the scene of political controversy in May 2006 when it initially appeared its voters had elected a British National Party candidate, Sharon Ebanks, to Birmingham City Council ‚Äì the first BNP candidate ever to be elected in Birmingham. However, it was announced by the Returning Officer shortly after the declaration that a counting error had taken place and, following a High Court recount, Ebanks was removed as Councillor on 26 July 2006 and replaced by Labour candidate Catherine Grundy.End of the road for BNP seat battle ‚Äì Birmingham Mail (27 July 2006) In 2014 Conservative Gary Sambrook defeated Labour in a by- election, caused by the resignation of Catharine Grundy. In the 2014 local elections Ron Storer also won the seat for the Conservatives from Labour, in what was once a safe Labour seat. World War II A number of bombs were dropped on the then new Kingstanding housing estate during World War II. On 25 August 1940, four people including a three-year-old boy were killed when a bomb hit a house in Kingstanding Road, while a bomb in Oundle Road claimed the life of a 27-year-old man and a third bomb in Hurlingham Road resulted in the death of a 61-year-old woman. Population Kingstanding had a population 25,702 at the time of the 2001 Population Census. It has a population density of 5,410 people per km¬≤ compared with 3,649 people per km¬≤ for Birmingham.

She was the sister of Patrick and Willie Pearse, two of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising. Early life 323x323px Margaret Mary Pearse was born at 27 Great Brunswick Street, in Dublin, the eldest child of James Pearse and Margaret Pearse (n√©e Brady). A family friend, Kate Brady, was present at the time of her birth. She grew up in cramped living conditions as often the other rooms in the house we rented by subtenants, forcing the Pearse family to share one room. During her childhood, Margaret was very friendly with James Vincent, her half-brother from her father's previous marriage. Their close relationship did not follow into adulthood. She developed a close bond with her father, more so than with her mother. She was educated at the Holy Faith Convent in Glasnevin. After leaving school, she trained as a teacher. Margaret did not enter paid employment after receiving her teacher training but was still interested in education. In 1905 she travelled to Belgium with her brother to study the workings of the bilingual education system and to improve her French. She tried to set up her own school for infants in 1907 in the family home on Great Brunswick Street and was constantly encouraged by her two brothers, whom assisted her in teaching on many occasions. Her younger brother Willie provided art work for the classes to inspire the students. Involvement with St Enda's School Margaret helped to found St Enda's School with her brothers Patrick and Willie in 1908. Margaret, along with her mother Mrs. Pearse, played an intricate part in making the school a comfortable atmosphere for the students. The school's prospectus lists Margaret as the Mistress of Preparatory Schools between 1909‚Äì1910 and as the Assistant Mistress between 1910‚Äì1911. Following the executions of her brothers in the aftermath of the Easter Rising, Margaret continued to run St Enda's School. She was the matron and housekeeper for the school, while her mother was the headmaster. The school began to experience financial difficulties in 1916 after the Easter rising, and was facing closure. Trips to the USA were made to raise funds for the school. The school was saved mostly by donations and continued to operate even though it was operating at a loss. Margaret was directly involved with the teaching as French teacher to junior pupils, and would often write to them to keep in contact during the holidays. During the period when the school experienced staff shortages, Margaret became even more involved with the school's affairs. Her involvement helped to feed her busy and hardworking nature. In 1926, Margaret went to America on a lecture tour with the intention of raising more funds for the school to cover its running costs. Margaret and her mother constantly fought over how to spend the money and eventually they raised enough to buy the school grounds. Margaret's mother had planned to leave St Enda's to the state in her will. However, due to legal complications, Margaret Mary inherited St.Enda's after Mrs Pearse's death in 1932. St Enda's closed in 1935 and Margaret continued to lived in the Hermitage. Margaret Mary did not always plan to leave St.Enda's to the state after her death as per her mother's wishes. Eamonn de Barra along with President at the time √âamon de Valera, influenced her decision to leave the school and its grounds to the state. The government also played an important part in persuading Margaret to leave the school to the nation. It guaranteed that St.Endas will always act as a memorial for Margaret's two brothers Patrick and William Pearse, and this seemed to be the final deciding factor for Margaret. An agreement was settled that while she was alive she would still be the full owner of the school and its grounds, and upon her death, the schools, its contents and the surrounding land would be given to the state. Political career She was first elected to D√°il √âireann as a Fianna F√°il Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin County constituency at the 1933 general election. She was described as a spinster from St Endas College in Rathfarnham. She was proposed for the position by Dr. James J.McCann of 23 Terenure Road.This was seconded by Frank Burke, St. Endas, Harolds Grange, Co.Dublin. She was defeated at 1937 general election by losing on the 7th count of votes. On 29 March 1938, she was elected to the Administrative Panel of the 2nd Seanad. Although she had rarely spoken out in the D√°il or Seanad, or posed any questions, she was described as being a hard worker behind the scenes and rarely missed any meetings. She was often referred to as ‚ÄòMaggie‚Äô by her colleagues. She served in the Seanad until her death in 1968 however, she and her mother were never more than figureheads for the party. She was a founding member of the teaching staff of Ardscoil √âanna in Crumlin, Dublin, upon its establishment in 1939. Her mother Margaret Pearse also served as a TD in the 1920s and she and Margaret Mary supported de Valera because they believed he attempted to sustain Patrick Pearse's political vision.  Family relations  Margaret and her sister Mary became increasingly estranged from one another due to their many disagreements. Margaret devoted the rest of her life preserving her brothers‚Äô memory and supported her brothers‚Äô involvement in the rising while Mary opposed it. Mary was also prone to anxiety and hypochondria. Margaret and her mother became very religious and glorified their family's part in the rising at the expense of other insurgents. They quickly condemned anyone who questioned or spoke out against the Pearse brothers. After the execution of Patrick and Willie, Margaret, Mary and her mother tried to have their bodies released but were refused. Later life Margaret's relationship with her sister was further strained after Mary Brigid published The Home-Life of P√°draig Pearse. This edited version of their brother, Patrick's, unfinished autobiography led to a dispute over the royalties from their brother's writings as Margaret Mary believed it belonged to both of them. A court hearing was set up, however, a last minute reconciliation saw it called off. They never repaired their relationship and Mary Brigid died in 1947, twenty-one years before Margaret Mary. Illness forced Margaret into the Linden Convalescent Home in Blackrock, County Dublin when she was in her 80s. In 1965, the chairman of the Dublin Red Cross Committee awarded Margaret with a certificate for her outstanding service and contribution to the Irish Red Cross Society. She had founded the Rathfarnham Red Cross branch and she had allowed her home in St. Enda's to be used as a first aid hospital. She was still a patient in the Linden Convalescent Home at the time this award was bestowed upon her. In 1967 when she was 89 years old, her condition was described to be deteriorating. However, in 1968 during the upcoming months of Margaret's 90th birthday, she left the Linden Convalescent Home for a short while in order to spend her birthday at St. Endas in Rathfarnham. The president of Ireland at the time, √âamon de Valera, went to visit her at St. Endas to congratulate her on her upcoming 90th birthday. On this visit the president was accompanied by Ann, his granddaughter. Other visitors including The Minister for Finance at the time Mr. Haughey and also The Lord Mayor of Dublin Mr. Frank Cluskey also visited Margaret in St. Endas to congratulate her on celebrating her birthday. Death The Pearse Museum located in Haroldsgrange, Dublin. Margaret Pearse died, unmarried, at the Linden Convalescent Home, Blackrock, County. Dublin, on November the 7th 1968 and was given a state funeral. Big crowds paid tribute Miss Pearse. The state funeral for Margaret was an honouring by military and civil organisations. The people who were close to her all come to the removal of her remains from Linden to Rathfarnham. The crowds gathered mainly consisted of teachers, nuns and students. There was also a big group from the Church due to their memories of the 1916 Easter Rising, to pay a tribute to the sister of the leader of the rising. Margaret was buried beside her parents and sister at Glasnevin cemetery. President De Valera, the church and the state all paid tribute to her at the funeral. Over 200 soldiers gave Margaret a military honour and traffic was halted as people paid their last respects. A detour was made so that the remains should pass by Miss Pearse's old home at Saint Endas. The hearse was followed by two army jeeps filled with green, white and orange wreaths as it passed through the city. The funeral then stood still for a minute outside the general post office. The mass was held in the church of the annunciation in Rathfarnham and was held in Irish by the Rev. Thomas Walsh. After the mass, military policemen of the eastern command carried the coffin, draped in the tricolour, to the hearse and a salute was given by a special guard and officer pallbearers. The funeral then passed through Rathfarnham village where 200 boys and girls from St. Enda's High School lined the route in tribute to Margaret. As the funeral party approached Glasnevin cemetery the army band played a dead march and a special guard of over 200 men gathered to salute the hearse as it passed through the cemetery gates. The coffin was then taken to the grave where her parents and sister were and a guard of honour of the Dublin Brigade lined the path.http://search.proquest.com/docview/525154848 The Taoiseach's tribute to the funeral was he spoke in English and Irish. He said that Margaret Mary Pearse was the last remaining member of the noble Pearse family. He said her life like her patriotic brothers was dedicated to Ireland. As per her mother's wishes, she bequeathed St Enda's to the people of Ireland as a memorial to her brother's sacrifice. The school is now home to Pearse Museum.

It is also the centre of an urban-rural municipality with the same name, an area of about 170 km¬≤, and about 5700 inhabitants (2010). History Brama Choje≈Ñska (Chojna Gate) The town probably originated from a Pomeranian settlement at an important trading route between Pozna≈Ñ and the Baltic Sea and has been a commercial centre ever since. In 1248 the settlement was known as Sconenvlete. Shortly after, the area came under the jurisdiction of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The merchant's house, built in the town centre in the 13th century, soon became the town hall. In 1281 the town was recorded as Schowenfliet which later changed into the High German Sch√∂nfliess. In the 14th century the town gained additional rights such as the one to a free market and the exemption from customs within the New March. From 1373 the town was part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (or Czech Lands), ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with Poland in Krak√≥w. Poland was to buy and re- incorporate the town and its surroundings, but eventually the Luxembourgs sold it to the Teutonic Order, whose rule lasted until 1454. It was burned down in 1433 during the Hussite Wars. Margrave John of Custrin, who took over the area in 1538, introduced the teachings of the Protestant Reformation. During the Thirty Years' War Sch√∂nfliess suffered major damage during occupations by the Imperial army in 1627 and by the troops of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in 1630, and was burned down by Wallenstein's troops in 1634. After the Napoleonic wars, economic development accelerated, and with the growth of the town, extra gates were broken into the old fortifications, parts of which were removed. Large parts of the town walls with several towers and two gates still exist to this day. Mud baths opened in Sch√∂nfliess in the late 19th century, and the town became a health resort and gained the official title Bad in 1907. Between 1871 and 1945 the town was part of Germany. After World War II, it became part of Poland, and its German-speaking population was forced to leave their hometown. The town was renamed to Trzci≈Ñsko-Zdr√≥j. The spa closed in 1948 and was relocated to Po≈Çczyn-Zdr√≥j, necessitated by the establishment of a Soviet airfield in nearby Chojna.

This palm genus is one of the largest in the Neotropics. Its 64 species are distributed from Mexico and Haiti in the north to Paraguay in the south; two are found in the Lesser Antilles. The genus is a member of the palm tribe Geonomeae (Arecaceae: Arecoideae), an important Neotropical group due to its wide distribution across Central and South America, its diversity and abundance, and the use of a number of species by local human populations.Roncal, J. Francisco-Ortega, C.B. Asmussen, and C.E. Lewis (2005). 'Molecular phylogenetics of the tribe Geonomeae (Arecaceae) using nuclear DNA sequences of Phosphoribulokinase and RNA Polymerase II'. (Systematic Botany 30(2): 275‚Äì283). The distribution of the tribe Geonomeae stretches from southeast Mexico down through Central America and into South America, notably Brazil and Bolivia, and species are also found in the Greater and Lesser Antilles.Wessels Boer (1968) as cited by Roncal, J.

(Systematic Botany 30(2): 275‚Äì283) This tribe consists of a group of understory and sub-canopy palms that populate both tropical lowland and montane forests. While members of this group are relatively easy to collect, as they are not canopy palms or spiny palms, and are well represented in herbaria, the taxonomy and phylogeny of the species within the tribe are still uncertain.Roncal, J.

(2001) 'Coding and noncoding plastid DNA in palm systematics' (American Journal of Botany 88: 1103‚Äì1117) The resolution of the tribe has been disputed despite the fact that Geonomeae species are characterized by three morphological synapomorphies: the petals of pistillate flowers are basally connate, the presence of slender and elongate styles, and the flowers are borne in pits in the rachillae.Uhl and Dransfield 1987 as cited by Roncal, J.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Vo≈ædovac.  Location  Braƒáe Jerkoviƒá is located between the valleys of the former creeks of Kumodra≈°ki potok and Mokrolu≈°ki potok. It borders the neighborhoods of Marinkova Bara (north), Du≈°anovac (north-west), Vo≈ædovac (west), Medakoviƒá II (north-east), Padina (east), while in the south it extends into the neighborhood of Braƒáe Jerkoviƒá II. It is bounded by the elbow-shaped street of the same name (on the west and south) and the street of Ignjata Joba (on the east). Northern border to Du≈°anovac and Marinkova Bara, just as it case with many neighborhoods of Belgrade, can not be clearly established, though majority of city maps place it between the Darvinova and Ignjata Joba streets.  Name and history  The name of the neighborhood means \\"Jerkoviƒá Brothers\\" and it was named after two brothers, fighters during the World War II, who were both killed in 1941. Neboj≈°a (1912-41), commander of the Maƒçva partisan detachment, and Du≈°an Jerkoviƒá (1914‚Äì41), commander of the U≈æice partisan detachment, were both teachers. Du≈°an was killed during the Battle of Kadinjaƒça, in November 1941, and was declared a National Hero of Yugoslavia. A street, today central one in the neighborhood, was named in their honor in 1946 so as the neighborhood which later developed around it.  Characteristics  Even though it leans on the Vo≈ædovac's industrial zone along the Kumodra≈°ka street, the neighborhood itself is entirely residential, built since the 1960s and the newer sections consist solely of residential buildings. Population of the local community Braƒáe Jerkoviƒá was 13,413 in 1981, 13,225 in 1991, 11,453 in 2002 and 9,661 in 2011, while the combined population of Braƒáe Jerkoviƒá and Mitrovo Brdo was 23,162 in 2011 and is often named as one of the largest neighborhoods in both municipality of Vo≈ædovac and the city of Belgrade. The main feature in the neighborhood is the Centralno groblje (\\"central cemetery\\"), one of two main graveyards in urban Belgrade (the other one being the Novo groblje (\\"new cememtery\\") in Zvezdara. The church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist is within the cemetery complex. There are three elementary schools in the neighborhood: \\"Branislav Nu≈°iƒá\\" (founded in 1935), \\"Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj\\" (founded in 1967), and \\"ƒêura Daniƒçiƒá\\" (moved from Zvezdara in 1970).

It has two children playgrounds and area for the senior citizens. New paths were placed so as the new lawn. Seedlings of the white birch were planted, so as the both deciduous and evergreen shrubs, including honeysuckle and Syrian rosemallow. In the vicinity of the park is a monument dedicated to Jerkoviƒá brothers, erected in 1979.  Braƒáe Jerkoviƒá II  Braƒáe Jerkoviƒá II or Veljko Vlahoviƒá (Serbian Cyrillic: –í–µ—ô–∫–æ –í–ª–∞—Ö–æ–≤–∏—õ) was officially assigned name to the newer, southern extension of the neighborhood. It occupies the area between the streets of Braƒáe Jerkoviƒá, Pive Karamatijeviƒáa and Dragice Konƒçar. Even though built in the 1970s, the name didn't live up and except for some official uses (like the real estate agencies advertising or the official style of the terminal station of the bus line 26). It was named after the Communist politician Veljko Vlahoviƒá (1914‚Äì75). In the early 2000s the name of the neighborhood was officially changed to Mitrovo Brdo.

The National Republican Air Force (Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana, or ANR) was the air force of the Italian Social Republic during World War II, closely linked with the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) in northern Italy. Description Wing and fuselage emblem of the A.N.R. from 1943 to 1944. The fuselage flag was retained and placed next to the cross. This air force was tasked with defending the industrial areas of the region, intercepting Allied bombers en route to southern Germany and the allied and occupied territories of the Axis, and giving close support to German and Italian land forces. Later during the war various units served with German forces based at Spilve, near Riga (Reichskommissariat Ostland), on the northern Russian Front, amongst others in the central and south area (Crimea) on the front. The ANR, after the 1943 armistice that divided Italy, received numbers of Italian aircraft, later augmented with their own local production, and further aircraft from Germany. This force was opposed to the Italian Co- Belligerent Air Force (Aviazione Cobelligerante Italiana, or ACI, or Aeronautica Cobelligerante del Sud), the Italian pro-Allied air force, though they never actually met in combat. Combat operations began in December 1943, leading, in the following January, to the attack performed by the 1st Squadriglia \\"Asso di Bastoni\\", against a formation of US P-38 Lightnings, three of which were shot down. Starting from June 1944, ANR started to receive Messerschmitt Bf 109G-6s for its fighter force. From October 1944 to February 1945, when the 1st Fighter Group \\"Asso di Bastoni\\" returned from training in Germany, 2nd Fighter Group \\"Gigi Tre Osei\\" was the only ANR fighter unit active in the defence of the northern Italian territory. From mid-1944, the casualty ratio started to outbalance the victories of the Italian pilots. The last interception missions were carried out on 19 April 1945. Bomber units included the Gruppo Aerosiluranti \\"Buscaglia Faggioni\\", led by Carlo Faggioni and named after Carlo Emanuele Buscaglia who, at the time, was presumed dead but was instead held in an Allied Prisoner of War camp and later fought with the Aeronautica Cobelligerante. The unit, using old Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, performed several raids against the Allied bridgehead of Anzio. Its only two recorded victories were the sinking of a British transport ship north of Benghazi (at the time the group was based in Greece), and an enemy cargo vessel off Rimini on 5 February 1945.

History The Lithuanian annexation of Ruthenian lands between the 13th and 15th centuries was accompanied by some Lithuanization. A large part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania remained Ruthenian; due to religious, linguistic and cultural dissimilarity, there was less assimilation between the ruling nobility of the pagan Lithuanians and the conquered Orthodox East Slavs. After the military and diplomatic expansion of the duchy into Ruthenian (Kievan Rus') lands, local leaders retained autonomy which limited the amalgamation of cultures.Orest Subtelny Ukraine. A History. Second edition, 1994. p. 70 When some localities received appointed Gediminids (rulers), the Lithuanian nobility in Ruthenia largely embraced Slavic customs and Orthodox Christianity and became indistinguishable from Ruthenian nobility. The cultures merged; many upper-class Ruthenians merged with the Lithuanian nobility and began to call themselves Lithuanians (Litvins) gente Rutenus natione Lituanus,Marshall Cavendish, \\"The Peoples of Europe\\", Benchmark Books, 2002 but still spoke Ruthenian.\\"The son of Gediminas, the Grand Prince Olgerd [(Algirdas)] expanded the Ruthenian lands he inherited from his father: he attached the Polish lands to his state expelling the Tatars out. The Ruthenian lands under his sovereignty were divided between princes. However, Olgerd, the person of a strong character, controlled them. In Kiev, he installed his son, Vladimir, who started the new line of Kiev princes that reigned there for over a century and called commonly the Olelkoviches, from Olelko, Aleksandr Vladimirovich, the grand-son of Olgerd. Olgerd himself, married twice the Ruthenian princesses, allowed his sons to baptize into Ruthenian religion and, as the Ruthenian Chronicles speak, had himself baptized and died as a monk. As such, the princes that replaced the St. Vladimir's [Rurikid] line in Ruthenia, became as Ruthenian by religion and by the ethnicity they adopted, as the princes of the line that preceded them. The Lithuanian state was called Lithuania, but of course it was purely Ruthenian and would have remained Ruthenian if only the successor of Olgerd in the Great Princehood, the Jagiello wouldn't have married in 1386 to the Polish queen Jadwiga\\" Nikolay Kostomarov, Russian History in Biographies of its main figures, section Knyaz Kostantin Konstantinovich Ostrozhsky (Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski) The Lithuanian nobility became largely Ruthenian,\\"Within the [Lithuanian] Grand Duchy, the Ruthenian lands initially retained considerable autonomy. The pagan Lithuanians themselves were increasingly converting to Orthodoxy and assimilating into Ruthenian culture. The grand duchy's administrative practices and legal system drew heavily on Slavic customs, and Ruthenian became the official state language. Direct Polish rule in Ukraine since the 1340s and for two centuries thereafter was limited to Galicia. There, changes in such areas as administration, law, and land tenure proceeded more rapidly than in Ukrainian territories under Lithuania.

It adapted Old Church Slavonic and (later) the Ruthenian language, and acquired main-chancery-language status in local matters and relations with other Orthodox principalities as a lingua franca; Latin was used in relations with Western Europe. Zigmas Zinkeviƒçius The Problem of a Slavonic Language as a Chancery Language in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania It was gradually reversed by the Polonization of Lithuania beginning in the 15th century and the 19th- and early-20th-century Russification of the former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth.Kevin O'Connor, The History of the Baltic States, Greenwood Press, , Google Print, p.58 A notable example of Lithuanization was the 19th- century replacement of Jews (many Lithuanian Jews, but also Polish Jews), until then the largest ethnic group in Lithuania's major towns with ethnic Lithuanians migrating from the countryside. Lithuanization was primarily demographic, rather than institutionalized. When Lithuania became an independent state after World War I, its government institutionalized Lithuanization.  Interbellum Republic of Lithuania  Interwar Lithuanian propaganda poster depicting Gediminas' Tower, urging Lithuanians not to forget the lost Vilnius Region Around the time of Lithuanian independence, the country began moving toward the cultural and linguistic assimilation of large groups of non-Lithuanian citizens (primarily Poles and Germans). The Lithuanian government was initially democratic, and protected the cultural traditions of other ethnic groups; a 1917 Vilnius Conference resolution promised national minorities cultural freedom. After World War I, the Council of Lithuania (the government's legislative branch) was expanded to include Jewish and Belarusian representatives. The first Lithuanian governments included ministries for Jewish and Belarusian affairs; when the Vilnius Region was detached from the country after ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny, however, the largest communities of Belarusians, Jews, and Poles ended up outside Lithuania and the special ministries were abolished. In 1920, Lithuania's Jewish community was granted national and cultural autonomy with the right to legislate binding ordinances; however, partly due to internal strife between Hebrew and Yiddish groups their autonomy was terminated in 1924. The Jews were increasingly marginalized and alienated by the \\"Lithuania for Lithuanians\\" policy.Eli Lederhendler, Jews, Catholics, and the burden of history, Oxford University Press US, 2006, , Google Print, p.322 As Lithuania established its independence and its nationalistic attitudes strengthened, the state sought to increase the use of Lithuanian in public life. Among the government's measures was a forced Lithuanization of non-Lithuanian names. The largest minority- school network was operated by the Jewish community; there were 49 Jewish grammar schools in 1919, 107 in 1923, and 144 in 1928. In 1931, partially due to consolidation, the number of schools decreased to 115 and remained stable until 1940. = Education = Interwar anti-Polish cartoon At the beginning of 1920, Lithuania had 20 Polish language schools for Poles in Lithuania. The number increased to 30 in 1923, but fell to 24 in 1926. The main reason for the decrease was the policy of Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, which transferred students whose parents had \\"Lithuania\\" as their nationality on their passports to Lithuanian schools. After the party lost control, the number of schools increased to 91. Soon after the 1926 coup d'√©tat, nationalists led by Antanas Smetona came to power. The nationalists decided to ban attendance at Polish schools by Lithuanians; children from mixed families were forced to attend Lithuanian schools. Many Poles in Lithuania were identified as Lithuanians on their passports, and were forced to attend Lithuanian schools. The number of Polish schools decreased to nine in 1940. In 1936, a law was passed which allowed a student to attend Polish school only if both parents were Poles. This resulted in unaccredited schools, which numbered over 40 in 1935 and were largely sponsored by Pochodnia. A similar situation developed concerning German schools in the Klaipƒóda Region.SILVA POCYTƒñ, DIDLIETUVIAI: AN EXAMPLE OF COMMITTEE OF LITHUANIAN ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVITIES (1934‚Äì1939) Edgar Packard Dean, Again the Memel Question, Foreign Affairs, Vol. 13, No. 4 (Jul., 1935), pp. 695-697 Lithuanian attitudes towards ethnic Poles were influenced by the concept of treating them as native Lithuanians who were Polonized over several centuries and needed to return to their \\"true identity\\". Another major factor was the tense relationship between Lithuania and Poland about the Vilnius Region and cultural (or educational) restrictions on Lithuanians there; in 1927, the Lithuanian Education Society Rytas chairman and 15 teachers were arrested and 47 schools closed. = Religion = Although the Lithuanian constitution guaranteed equal rights to all religions, the government confiscated Orthodox churches (some of which had been converted from Catholic churches). Former Eastern Catholic Churches were confiscated as well, including the Kruonis Orthodox church. Thirteen Orthodox churches were demolished. Another target group for discrimination was the Poles; anti-Polish sentiment had appeared primarily due to the occupation of Lithuania's capital Vilnius in 1920. Lithuanian Catholic priests (derogatorily called Litwomans in Polish language) promoted the Lithuanian language in equal terms to Polish, which in many places had been used forced onto the locals by central Church authorities. It was often the case, that the parish was inhabited by Lithuanian-speaking people, yet they knew their prayers only in Polish, as the priests tried Polonizing them. Eugeniusz R√∂mer (1871-1943) noted that the Lithuanian National Revival was positive in some respects, he described some excesses, which he found often to be funny, although aggressive towards Poles and Polish culture. An example of such excess was when Lithuanian priests were forced to drive out of confessional boxes people who wanted to confess in the Polish language or refused to sing Polish songs that were sung in those churches for centuries during additional services, preferring the use of Lithuanian language instead. Anti-Polish propaganda was sponsored by the government; during the interwar period, caricatures and propaganda were published attacking Poles and depicting them as criminals or vagabonds. Modern Lithuania In modern Lithuania, which has been independent since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Lithuanization is not an official state policy. It is advocated by groups such as Vilnija, however, whose activities create tension in Polish-Lithuanian relations.Leonardas Vilkas, LITEWSKA, ≈ÅOTEWSKA I ESTO≈ÉSKA DROGA DO NIEPODLEG≈ÅO≈öCI I DEMOKRACJI: PR√ìBA POR√ìWNANIA (Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian Way to Independence: An Attempt to Compare, on homepage of Jerzy Targalski According to the former minister of education and science of Lithuania, Zigmas Zinkeviƒçius, Lithuanian Poles are Polonized Lithuanians who \\"are incapable of understanding where they truly belong\\" and it is \\"every dedicated Lithuanian's duty\\" to re-Lithuanize them. Lithuanization promoted the cooperation of Polish and Russian minorities, who support the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania. The Law on Ethnic Minorities, which remained in force until 2010, enabled bilingual sings in areas that have \\"substantial numbers of a minority with a different language\\". After the termination of its validity, municipal authorities in ≈†alƒçininkai and Vilnius were ordered to remove bilingual Polish-Lithuanian signs, most of which had been placed during the period when such signs were permitted.

Career Teverson was educated at the University of Exeter. He joined the Liberal Democrats, for which he stood unsuccessfully in South East Cornwall at the 1992 United Kingdom general election. At the 1994 European Parliament election, Teverson was elected Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Cornwall and West Plymouth, becoming one of the first two Liberal Democrats ever elected to the European Parliament along with Graham Watson in Somerset and North Devon. He was Chief Whip of the European Liberal Democrats from 1997 and 1999. In 1999, he was Chairman of Finance South West Ltd. At the 1999 European Parliament election, the UK switched from electing MEPs in first past the post constituencies to a form of region-based proportional representation. Each party put forward a list of candidates, and the higher its vote share, the more seats it would be awarded. Watson and Teverson were both MEPs in the South West region, and the Liberal Democrats placed Watson in first position on its list and Teverson in second position. At the election, the Liberal Democrats polled 16.5% of the vote in the South West, entitling them to just one of the region's seven seats. Thus Watson was elected, but Teverson lost his seat. On 1 June 2006, he was created a life peer as Baron Teverson, of Tregony in the County of Cornwall. During his time in the Lords he has chaired both the House of Lords EU select sub-committee on External Affairs, and its ad-hoc select committee on the Arctic. He oversaw the publication of the Committee's report 'responding to a changing Arctic' which explored 'recent and expected changes in the Arctic and their implications for the UK and its international relations'. Teverson has sat on the Liberal Democrat Federal Executive and has also previously chaired the Party's national finance committee. Teverson was elected to Cornwall Council for the new St Mewan ward in the 2009 election. during which time he sat as the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Cornwall Council. He did not stand in the subsequent 2013 Cornwall Council election. Personal life Teverson is the son of Crofton Teverson. He was educated at Exeter University.

It opened in 1907 and is Seattle's oldest active theater, hosting a variety of theatrical productions, concerts and lectures. The Moore is currently operated by the Seattle Theatre Group, which also runs the 2,803-seat Paramount Theatre and the Neptune Theatre. History Built for Seattle real estate developer James A. Moore and designed by E. W. Houghton,http://pcad.lib.washington.edu/person/1561/ E. W. Houghton the Moore Theatre functioned as a lavish social venue for the Gilded Age elite of early 20th-century Seattle. It opened in late 1907, in time for the originally planned date of the Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition which was ultimately postponed to 1909. The Moore Theatre and adjoining Moore Hotel were designed partly to accommodate and entertain tourists for this event. The theater was initially operated by John Cort, later the founder of a major Broadway theatre venue in New York. Programming continued at the Moore through the 1930s, but changes in entertainment gradually led to it facing a struggle for survival by the 1970s. In 1975 it became the Moore Egyptian, with the lease being taken over by Dan Ireland and Darryl MacDonald. They added Egyptian to the title to link it to the many Egyptian Theaters in the U.S. and Canada and give the venue added sex appeal. There had previously been a Seattle Egyptian Theater on University Way (The Ave) in the University District. Ireland and MacDonald transformed the theater into a movie palace; Dennis Nyback was the projectionist. The Moore Egyptian was the birthplace of the Seattle International Film Festival in 1976. In 1981 the Moore's owners declined to renew their lease and moved to a Masonic Temple on Capitol Hill, taking the \\"Egyptian\\" name with them. The Moore Theatre and Hotel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Since the 1980s, it has hosted touring musicians and theatrical productions. It currently seats about 1,800 people. Architecture Built of reinforced concrete (plus an enormous steel girder spanning the width of the house, carrying the weight of the balcony without the need for support columns)Kreisman, L: \\"Made to Last,\\" page 36. University of Washington Press, 1999 and faced with a fa√ßade of white ceramic tile and terra-cotta, the theater is a mix of elements of the Byzantine and Italianate styles. Like most theaters, the exterior is relatively plain and stylistically neutral compared to the extravagant interior. The staging area was the largest of any theater in Seattle, with an electrical system that was state-of-the-art for its time, and unusually numerous dressing rooms. Seating 2,436 in its original configuration, the Moore was one of the largest theatres in the U.S. at the time. The Moore was characterized by innovative architecture, luxurious materials, and sumptuous decor. The upper balcony, although well-appointed for its day, was originally racially segregated from the rest of the theater hall. It once had separate entrances, and to this day has a separate staircase connecting it to just inside the front door. The Moore's architect, E. W. Houghton, also designed the Seeley Theatre in Pomeroy, Washington.http://historicpomeroy.com/nomination/bldg56.htm Like the Moore, the Seeley, which currently seats 270 people, features a steel girder supporting the balcony without the need for supporting columns.

In 1975‚Äì1982, Porƒôba was a district of Zawiercie. History Porƒôba belongs to Lesser Poland, and until 1795 (see Partitions of Poland), it was part of Krakow Voivodeship. First mention of the Porƒôba settlement comes from 1375, and at that time, it was called Black Porƒôba, located by a lake called Black Lake. Until the 16th century, the area was sparsely populated, and covered by dense woods. The development of industry resulted in influx of settlers, and in the 16th century Porƒôba became a center of early steel and iron plants. The village belonged at that time to the Pilecki family. In 1795, after the third partition of Poland, first blast furnace was built (1798, due to efforts of Count Lucas Bninski). In 1815, the village became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and Porƒôba further developed, becoming a local industrial center. In 1918 Porƒôba returned to the re-created Poland, and in the Second Polish Republic, the settlement belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. Porƒôba developed further in the 1950s, when local metal plant began manufacturing machine tools. A vocational school was opened in 1946, which in the late 1960s moved into a new complex.

It is located in Rio de Janeiro, the capital city of Brazil from 1822 to 1960, more specifically at Cinel√¢ndia square. The largest library in Latin America and the 7th largest in the world, its collections include about 9 million items. It organized the first library science courses in Latin America and its staff has led the modernization of library services, including the development of online databases.Murray, Stuart A. P. ‚ÄúThe Library: An Illustrated History.‚Äù New York, NY: Skyhorse Publishing, 2012, p. 277. History The National Library, c. 1920 The history of the National Library began on 1 November 1755, when Lisbon suffered a violent earthquake. The Royal Library was considered one of the most important libraries in Europe at that time. This irreparable loss to the Portuguese was the impetus for moving many of its contents to Brazil. The collection was brought in three stages, the first being in 1810 and two in 1811. The library of 60,000 books was accommodated initially in the upstairs rooms of the Third Order of Carmel Hospital (in accordance with the charter of July 27, 1810), located in the old back street of Carmel close to the Imperial Palace. The facilities, however, were considered inadequate and as well potentially jeopardizing the valuable collection. Therefore, on 29 October 1810, a date that was assigned to the official founding of the National Library, Prince Regent John (later King John VI of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves) issued a decree which provided that a royal library should be established from the funds of the royal treasury.Murray, S. (2009). The library : an illustrated history / Stuart A.P. Murray ; introduction by Donald G. Davis, Jr. ; foreword by Nicholas A. Basbanes. New York, NY : Skyhorse Pub. ; Chicago : ALA Editions, 2009. Expansion Main entrance to the Library The works for the new building of the Library only took place in 1813, when the collection was transferred. While the process of setting up the books, which began in 1810, was taking place the consultation of the Library collection could already be carried out by scholars, by royal consent, and in 1814, after the collection of the collection was completed, the consultation was public. Officially established, the library continued to have a significant expansion through purchases, donations, mainly, and \\"tips\\", that is, by the obligatory delivery of a copy of all printed material in the typographic offices of Portugal (By decree of 12 September 1805) and in the Royal Printing, installed in Rio de Janeiro. This legislation on tips was improved over the years and culminated in Decree No. 1,825 of 20 December 1907, commonly called the Legal Deposit Decree, still in force. Transfer of sovereignty After the death of Queen Maria I in March 1816, the reign of King John VI began, and it remained in Brazil until 1821, when political circumstances made him return to Lisbon with the Royal Family, except for his eldest son Prince Pedro de Alc√¢ntara of Braganza (future Emperor of Brazil), who came to proclaim the independence of Brazil in 1822. Here also remained the Royal Library. At that time it had grown a lot and, after Independence, in 1822, became property of the Empire of Brazil, because its purchase is included in the Additional Convention to the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance signed between Brazil and Portugal on 29 August 1825. For the goods left in Brazil the Royal Family was indemnified in two million pounds sterling, of that value, eight hundred contos de reis were destined to the payment of the Royal Library, which was then called the Imperial and Public Library of the Court. Building Fa√ßade of the current building in 2010 In 1858, the Library was transferred to the Passeio street, number 60, in Lapa square, and installed in the building that had the purpose to better shelter its collection. As its collection continued to grow with donations, acquisitions and through legal contributions, purchase of rare art collections at auctions and in bookstores around the world, a new building was needed that best suited its needs. The constant and permanent growth of the collection of the library was fundamental for the realization of a project of construction of a seat that would attend all the needs of the library, adequately accommodating its collections. Based on this, his current building was designed, which had its cornerstone launched on 15 August 1905, during the government of Rodrigues Alves. The inauguration took place on 29 October 1910, during the Nilo Pe√ßanha government and in the first centenary of the Library. The building of the National Library, whose project is signed by the military engineer Sousa Aguiar, has an eclectic style, in which neoclassical and art nouveau elements are mixed, and contains ornaments by artists such as Eliseu Visconti, Henrique and Rodolfo Bernardelli, Modesto Brocos and Rodolfo Amoedo. Eliseu Visconti, still in 1903, had already designed the ex-libris and the emblem of the National Library. The library building is located at Rio Branco Avenue, number 219, Cinel√¢ndia Square, in the center of Rio de Janeiro, composing with the National Museum of Fine Arts and the Municipal Theater an architectural and cultural ensemble of great value. Catalog In 1911, Manoel Cicero Peregrino da Silva started a national union catalog for all Brazilian libraries. He set up the first library science course in South America.

The first of these was Royal Veragua, the territories on the Caribbean coast that had been part of Columbian Veragua before the creation of the Duchy of Veragua in 1537 for Admiral Luis Col√≥n y Toledo, namely present-day Nicaragua, Costa Rica and part of Panama. The second was the Pacific coast that had constituted Castilla de Oro, namely from the Gulf of Nicoya on the west to the borders of the Duchy of Veragua. The first governor of Nuevo Cartago y Costa Rica, named in 1540, was Diego Guti√©rrez y Toledo. He arrived in the territory in 1543 and founded the town of Santiago and the city of San Francisco. He was killed by the indigenous inhabitants in 1544. In 1549 Juan P√©rez de Cabrera was named to succeed Guti√©rrez y Toledo, but the Crown revoked the nomination. In 1561 Juan de Cavall√≥n y Arboleda was named alcalde mayor of the province. His assistant, Fray Juan de Estrade R√°vago y A√±ez succeeded him in 1562.

He attended Saint Martin's School of Art, London. His first major official commission was a mural for the 1951 Festival of Britain, in the Country Pavilion, for the Milk Marketing Board. In the same year, he was also commissioned to create the scenic design for the premiere of Fate‚Äôs Revenge by the Ballet Rambert. Throughout the 1950s, he contributed witty line illustrations, decorations and cartoons to Lilliput, for which he also painted several covers in colour, Punch, Picture Post, Scope, and Good Housekeeping, for which he drew a regular series entitled \\"Semolina Silkpaws\\". He also illustrated a series of full-colour booklets for Guinness advertising campaigns. Other important advertising work included elegant watercolour covers for Fortnum & Mason catalogues. In the early 1960s, he moved with his wife Iris to St Ives in Cornwall, so he could diversify from \\"commercial art\\" into painting and other endeavours. As well as developing his noted series of surreal paintings in oil, which were sold through the Portal Gallery in London, he set up, with Iris, an initiative called \\"Studio 22\\". Together, they designed and made ceramic jewellery, art pottery and beach clothes such as kaftans. They moved back to London in the 1970s, where Ronnie continued to paint for the Portal Gallery and provide illustrations for the Bond Street fashion emporium, Ports. However, he was increasingly drawn to book illustration. Alongside a successful series in collaboration with the poet Gavin Ewart ‚Äì The Learned Hippopotamus (1986), Caterpillar Stew (1990) and Like It Or Not (1992) ‚Äì he began writing children‚Äôs stories as well as illustrating them. His first book as both writer and artist, Osbert And Lucy (1988), was successful not only in Britain but also in the USA, and was translated into several European languages. It was subsequently included in the 2003 anthology, The Hutchinson Book of Bunny Tales. His second book, Bumpity And the Big Snake, was published in 1994.

Concerned with poor web response times (in 1996, broadband was virtually unknown in the UK), Tesco offered a CDROM-based off-line ordering program which would connect only to download stock lists and send orders.

The plot follows eight cycles in the lives of six Manhattan residents whose inter-connections form a circle that places each of them less than the proverbial six degrees of separation from the others. Plot  The circle begins with Tommy Reilly, a onetime wannabe writer who became the producer of a weekly television entertainment news show by design rather than choice, and has stayed with it for the money rather than any professional satisfaction. Dumped by his live-in girlfriend without warning, he temporarily moves in with colleague Carpo, an aging Lothario ready to offer unlimited -- and sometimes useless -- romantic advice. At a video store, Tommy meets grammar school teacher Maria Tedesko. The two flirt, meet for coffee and begin to date. Maria, recently divorced, finds it difficult to commit to a new relationship and stops taking Tommy's calls. When she discovers she's pregnant, she attempts to reconnect with him, but at the last moment opts to lie and tell him she's leaving town and chooses to raise the child on her own. Maria's ex-husband, who longs to reconcile with her, is Benjamin Bazler, an apartment house doorman and aspiring songwriter whose obsession is 1960s/1970s rock music. He shares his dream of becoming a full-time musician with Iowa transplant Ashley, an NYU student working as a coffee shop waitress to support herself. Ashley is involved in an affair with considerably older married dentist Griffin Ritso. Although he professes to love his mistress, the once divorced Griffin shies away from leaving his wife Annie Matthews for fear of being a two-time loser at matrimony. Eventually, Griffin's inability to commit to their relationship causes Ashley to dump him and reject his advances to get her back as she becomes involved in a relationship with Benjamin. Real estate broker Annie is unhappy with her marriage but too moral to consider having an affair. She finds herself confiding in and flirting with one of her house-hunting clients -- Tommy Reilly. Thus the circle is complete. She finally leaves Griffin. The narrative segments are intermingled with documentary-like interviews in which of the characters address the camera with their thoughts about sex, love, and relationships. Production notes The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2001. Following the terrorist attacks three days later, Paramount Classics withheld its release until late November. Although the World Trade Center looms behind Tommy during his interviews, the image of the twin towers in the original promotional poster was deleted. In an episode of the Sundance Channel series Anatomy of a Scene that focused on the film, Burns revealed he shot the film in only seventeen days, working with a budget of $1 million. Many of the locations used were within the same neighborhood in order to facilitate a quick move from one to the other.

Scott said, \\"Though it fails to be very interesting, Sidewalks of New York, like the people who populate Mr. Burns's New York, is impossible to dislike. If it's not especially funny, it is appealingly good- humored, and the actors perform well within the limitations of the script ... [Burns] deserves credit for avoiding the sudsy happily-ever-after clich√©s that deform so many contemporary romantic comedies. The view of love that emerges from Sidewalks, while it is not particularly deep or insightful, is refreshingly hard-headed without being altogether cynical.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, \\"The movie lives at the intersection between Woody Allen and Sex and the City...[It] is funny without being hilarious, touching but not tearful, and articulate in the way that Burns is articulate, by nibbling earnestly around an idea as if afraid that the core has seeds.\\" In Variety, Scott Foundas called the film \\"not just instantly forgettable, but beginning to fade from memory even as its images still play across the screen\\" and one \\"seized by fitful bouts of hilarity and charm,\\" a picture whose \\"overall impression is one of overindulgence and underimagination - a sponge cake without the yeast.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \\"In the world of this picture, just about everything people do with their clothes on is a sham, or at best some lame diversion between the spasms of real life that take place only in a bedroom. This may be the way very young adults think, but as a presentation of grown-ups, Sidewalks of New York is just weird. It's also, scene by scene, well acted and well written. Burns writes clever dialogue, and he knows how to work with actors.\\" In USA Today, Mike Clark rated the film two out of a possible four stars and commented, \\"Any goodwill the performers build up is quickly shot down by the incessant interviews, which restate the obvious when they're not showing how self- delusional some of these characters are. Those who teach public speaking sometimes advocate telling your audience what you're going to tell them, then actually telling them, then telling them what you've told them. Sidewalks reproves this isn't a wise path for movies.\\" Box office The film played on 224 screens and grossed $2,402,459 in the United States. The international box office accounted for another $1.1 million.

The converted code can then be synthesized and translated into a hardware device such as a field- programmable gate array. Compared to software, equivalent designs in hardware consume less power (yielding higher performance per watt) and execute faster with lower latency, more parallelism and higher throughput. However, system design and functional verification in a hardware description language can be tedious and time-consuming, so systems engineers often write critical modules in HDL and other modules in a high-level language and synthesize these into HDL through C to HDL or high-level synthesis tools. C to is another name for this methodology. RTL refers to the register transfer level representation of a program necessary to implement it in logic.  History Early development on C to HDL was done by Ian Page, Charles Sweeney and colleagues at Oxford University in the 1990s who developed the Handel-C language. They commercialized their research by forming Embedded Solutions Limited (ESL) in 1999 which was renamed Celoxica in September 2000. In 2008, the embedded systems departments of Celoxica was sold to Catalytic for $3 million and which later merged to become Agility Computing. In January 2009, Mentor Graphics acquired Agility's C synthesis assets. Celoxica continues to trade concentrating on hardware acceleration in the financial and other industries.  Applications  C to HDL techniques are most commonly applied to applications that have unacceptably high execution times on existing general- purpose supercomputer architectures. Examples include bioinformatics, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), financial processing, and oil and gas survey data analysis. Embedded applications requiring high performance or real-time data processing are also an area of use. System-on-chip (SoC) design may also take advantage of C to HDL techniques. C-to-VHDL compilers are very useful for large designs or for implementing code that might change in the future. Designing a large application entirely in HDL may be very difficult and time-consuming; the abstraction of a high level language for such a large application will often reduce total development time. Furthermore, an application coded in HDL will almost certainly be more difficult to modify than one coded in a higher level language. If the designer needs to add new functionality to the application, adding a few lines of C code will almost always be easier than remodeling the equivalent HDL code.

He studied at the College of Aurillac, the Lyc√©e Saint-Louis in Paris and at √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. In 1862 he began work as an assistant in the laboratory of Louis Pasteur (1822‚Äì1895). During his career, he taught classes in Tours (1865), Clermont-Ferrand (1866), Lyon (from 1873) and Paris (from 1878). In Paris, he was a professor of meteorology at the Institute of Agronomy. For much of his career he was associated with the work of Louis Pasteur. In 1888 he was elected to the Acad√©mie des sciences, and in 1894 became a member of the Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine. Duclaux's work was largely in the fields of chemistry, bacteriology, hygiene and agriculture. Duclaux initiated the custom of naming enzymes by adding the suffix \\"-ase\\" to the enzyme's substrate. His intention was to honor the first scientists (namely Anselme Payen, 1795‚Äì1871; and Jean-Fran√ßois Persoz, 1805‚Äì1868) to isolate an enzyme; \\"diastase\\", in 1833.William H.

See Chapter 1, especially p. 9. With Pasteur, he collaborated in the study of silkworm diseases, and also took part in experiments to debunk the theory of spontaneous generation. In the 1870s, he undertook studies of phylloxera, an aphid-like pest that plagued grape vineyards. In addition, he performed research on the composition of milk, and conducted studies on beer and wine. In 1887 he began publication of the Annales de l'Institut Pasteur, with Charles Chamberland (1851-1908), Jacques-Joseph Grancher (1843‚Äì1907), Edmond Nocard (1850‚Äì1903) and Pierre Paul √âmile Roux (1853‚Äì1933) as members of the first editorial board. Following Pasteur's death in 1895, Duclaux became director of the Institute, with Roux and Chamberland serving as its sub-directors. Duclaux was a prolific writer, some of his better known publications were Trait√© de microbiologie, L'hygi√®ne sociale, Ferments et maladies and Pasteur, histoire d'un esprit, the latter being a biography dedicated to Pasteur. Being actively involved in French politics, he was a vocal supporter of Alfred Dreyfus (1859-1935), when the latter was unjustly accused of treason. Duclaux's second wife, Agnes Mary Frances Duclaux (maiden name Agnes Mary Frances Robinson 1857‚Äì1944), was a well-known author, and his son, Jacques Eug√®ne Duclaux (1877‚Äì1978), was a highly regarded chemist.

It is made from a combination of moving the record on the turntable by hand and quick movement of the crossfader.  Creation  The crab scratch was invented by DJ Qbert while in Japan. Qbert then took the idea back to San Francisco and after showing the scratch to DJ Disk, he created a move that used 3 or 4 fingers: the crab. Later in 1995, while the DMC USA finals were being held in San Francisco, a group of DJs and judges which included The Beat Junkies, The X-Men (now called the X-ecutioners), and the rest of ISP among others got together for what would later be known as the \\"Famous Warehouse Session\\" at Yoga Frog's old mobile DJ warehouse. It was at this session that Qbert publicized the new scratch. While the name \\"crab\\" seems self-explanatory since it makes your hand look like a crab when you curl all of your fingers to perform it, according to Qbert the name originated elsewhere. Apparently, he and Mixmaster Mike had just returned from Beirut, Lebanon around the same time that he invented it where they were served crepes one night after a show. He said that when the people over there pronounced crepes, it sounded more like \\"cccccreb\\" and since he thought it was funny, he used it to name the \\"cccccreb\\" scratch which everyone now pronounces as the crab.  Technique  To do a crab scratch the DJ quickly rubs/taps the fader knob with 3 or 4 different fingers in sequence starting with the pinkie or ring finger while using the thumb as a spring to cut the fader back out after each tap (or in if scratching hamster style). The result is much like a 3 or 4 tap transform (or a 3 or 4 click flare if you scratch hamster style) only much quicker than you could probably do with one finger. Many DJs find this move easier or more comfortable to perform hamster style by bouncing the fader off the side of the fader slot, but the move can be performed both normal and hamster. As with orbits, crabs can be performed once as a single distinct move, or sequenced to produce a cyclical never ending type of crab sound.

The Hairy Who Years In 1964, Jim Nutt and Gladys Nilsson began to teach children's classes at the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago. They and James Falconer approached the center's exhibitions director, Don Baum, with the idea of a group show consisting of the three of them and Art Green and Suellen Rocca. Baum agreed, and also suggested they include Karl Wirsum. The name of the group show, \\"Hairy Who?\\", became the name of the group.

There were exhibitions at the Hyde Park Art Center in 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969. The 1968 exhibition traveled to the San Francisco Art Institute, and the last show, in 1969, traveled to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. Later career In 1969, the influential Chicago gallery owner Phyllis Kind agreed to represent Nutt and Gladys Nilsson, giving both of them their first solo shows. In that same year Nutt and Nilsson moved to Sacramento, California, where he was an assistant professor of art at Sacramento State College. In 1972 Walter Hopps, director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, chose Nutt along with other artists to represent the United States at the 1972 Venice Biennial, and he was also included, along with a number of his Chicago colleagues, in the 1973 S√£o Paulo Art Biennial. In 1974 Nutt and his family returned to Chicago. They have lived in Wilmette since 1976. Jim Nutt had his first solo show in 1974 at the Museum of Contemporary Art; it then traveled to the Walker Art Center and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Dubbed \\"Queen of the citadels\\" (Reine des citadelles) by Vauban, it is one of the most notable citadels designed by Vauban. It is remarkable for its size, the quality of the architecture, and the state of preservation today. Its various components have been classified as historic monuments in 1914, 1921 and 1934 respectively. A first-class military installation Layout of the citadel Soay sheep used by the city to crop vegetation around the fortifications. These small sheep are very comfortable on the slopes and replace the mechanical equipment otherwise required. This \\"Queen of Citadels\\" is the matrix of most citadels designed by Vauban. Established on the border of Flanders, it was part of a double-line of fortified towns between Gravelines, Dunkirk and Maubeuge-Rocroi. It delineated the famous \\"Pr√© Carr√©\\" (\\"square field\\") conceived by Vauban comprising 28 fortified cities. From Lille, Vauban supervised the construction of the many citadels and canals of the North, which controlled the border between France and Belgium. Lille was taken from Spain by French troops in August 1667, and Louis XIV immediately ordered the construction of a fortress. Louis Nicolas de Clerville and Vauban proposed plans. Vauban's were those chosen by the King. Work was started in 1668 under the direction of Lille's master mason, Simon Vollant. In 1671, the citadel became operational while Vauban continued to shape the city by constructing, a few steps away, a new neighborhood around the Rue Royale. The design of the citadel follows a simple but very effective idea: not one of its walls can be approached by the enemy without them being under fire from a nearby wall. Location The citadel was constructed to the west of the city on marshland at the junction of the rivers De√ªle and Bucquet. This allowed the use of swamp water and mud as a natural defense to make conditions more difficult for any possible enemy besieging the citadel. Through a system of locks and water gates, 1,700 hectares around the citadel could be flooded to a depth of 55 cm. A wide esplanade interrupted the plans, connecting the fort to the city. In 1750, a canal along the esplanade was drilled according to the plans drawn up by Vauban.

West of U.S. Route 41, the road is 4 lanes wide to get over Sarasota Bay on the Stickney Point Bridge. The road is then 6 lanes wide from US 41 to the Interstate 75 interchange. Immediately east of Interstate 75, the road transforms from 6 lanes wide to 2 lanes wide. It crosses the Myakka River and provides access to Myakka River State Park. A block west of the eastern terminus is CR 661, an alternative of U.S. Route 17 and provides access to State Road 60 (via SR 37). Its eastern terminus is with an intersection of SR 70 near Arcadia. Route description SR 72 westbound past I-75 interchange near Bee Ridge SR 72 begins at an intersection with the southern terminus of SR 758 to the east of the Gulf of Mexico in Siesta Key, Sarasota County, heading northeast on Stickney Point Road, a four-lane divided highway. The road passes through commercial areas, crossing the Intracoastal Waterway on a drawbridge. The state road heads into Gulf Gate Estates, passing through residential areas before heading into a commercial area and crossing US 41/SR 45. Past this intersection, SR 72 passes more homes and businesses as a seven-lane road with a center left-turn lane, curving east onto Clark Road at the Swift Road intersection. The road continues through developed areas, crossing South Lockwood Ridge Road, CR 773 (Beneva Road), and Sawyer Road. The state road becomes a six-lane divided highway and intersects McIntosh Road as it crosses a Seminole Gulf Railway line. SR 72 passes more businesses and intersects Sawyer Loop Road, Honore Avenue, and Gantt Road before coming to an interchange with I-75/SR 93 near Bee Ridge. Past this interchange, the state road narrows to four lanes before becoming a two-lane undivided road as it heads through residential areas, passing to the north of Twin Lakes Park. The road turns to the southeast and heads into a mix of wooded neighborhoods and fields, becoming an unnamed road. SR 72 curves east again and runs through rural areas of woods and swamps. The road enters Myakka River State Park and turns southeast. The state road continues through wooded swamps within the state park, heading east again. SR 72 leaves Myakka River State Park and passes through areas of fields and trees. The road crosses into DeSoto County and continues through rural areas for several more miles, intersecting CR 769. SR 72 turns northeast and passes through farmland and trees with some homes, intersecting CR 661 before ending at an intersection with SR 70 to the west of Arcadia. Future Starting in the Summer of 2021 the interchange with I-75 will be upgraded to a diverging diamond interchange. The on and off ramps on I-75 will be reconstructed as well as a auxiliary lane. Also noise barrier wall, sidewalks and bike lanes will be added along SR 72. The project is expected to cost around 51 million dollars and will take about two years to complete. Major intersectionsCounty Road 72A County Road 72A (CR 72A) is a west-to-east suffixed alternate of SR 72. The road is named \\"Proctor Road,\\" and much of it is four lanes wide. It begins as a four-lane undivided highway at US 41 and doesn't become a divided highway until it reaches the Sarasota County Technical Institute. At McIntosh Road it narrows to a two-lane undivided highway. At Honore Avenue it widens to a four-lane divided highway. After the intersection of Cattleman Road and Grove Point Boulevard the road narrows down to a two-lane undivided highway before crossing over I-75 with no access, then returns to ground level after a power sub-station on the northeast corner of the overpass. After the intersection of a one-lane dead end street named Falcon Place, it curves to the southeast where it will eventually meet up with its parent route at the intersection with Dove Avenue. A former right of way of the road can be seen on the northeast corner of the terminus.

History The committee existed in three different versions during the last 60 years, each with a set timetable and responsibilities.  1945-1947  The committee was established by S. Con. Res. 23, 78th Congress. It held 39 public hearings between March 3 and June 29, 1945, as well as four executive sessions. Over 100 witnesses testified, including 45 members of Congress, and an additional 37 members submitted statements. The recommendations of the committee led to streamlining of congressional committees and adoption of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946.  1965-1966  The committee was established on March 11, 1965 by S. Con. Res. 2, 89th United States Congress. Its mission was to study the operation of Congress and recommend improvements \\"with a view toward strengthening the Congress, simplifying its operations, improving its relationship with other branches of the United States Government, and enabling it better to meet its responsibilities under the Constitution.\\" The committee held hearings over a period of 5 months, taking testimony from 199 witnesses, including 106 members of Congress. The committee issued its final report (S. Rept. 1414) on July 28, 1966. This work eventually led to the passage of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970.  1991-1994  The last and most recent version of this committee attempted further reforms, some of which were adopted by Congress when Republicans gained control of the House and Senate after the 1994 Congressional elections. Key among these was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (), which applied provisions of 11 major labor laws to Congress and its employees for the first time.

She is venerated in the Roman Catholic Church. She is known as the Liberator of the Slaves in the New World, and as the mother of the town of Mana, French Guiana. Early life She was born in the commune of Chamblanc,Rudge, F.M. \\"Venerable Anne-Marie Javouhey.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 7 March 2020 the fifth of ten children of a local wealthy farm couple, Balthazar and Claudine Javouhey. Through her teen years, she helped to hide and care for a number of priests persecuted by the French Revolution, including keeping watch for them as they said Mass. She made a private vow when she was nineteen years old, but was not able to become a nun because the revolutionary government had closed convents and churches. In 1800, she joined the Daughters of Charity at Besan√ßon. In 1800, she is reported to have had a vision of Teresa of Avila entrusting children of different races to her.Ghezzi, Bert. Voices of the Saints, Loyola Press She did not understand its meaning at the time. Javouhey did not remain at the convent. In 1801, she started a school for poor children near Chamblanc. Given the poverty of the conditions, it was not particularly successful. She then entered a Trappistine Convent, and having completed the novitiate, once again returned home. Foundress Javouhey was joined by three of her sisters, and together they opened a school and an orphanage. Their father provided some financial assistance. She founded the Sisters of St. Joseph at Cabillon in 1805 to educate children and to help reduce the miseries which arose out of the French Revolution. In early stages in order to get children to attend the school, she resorted to playing football with the locals and requested them to attend school to play more football. She received permission from the government to use a former seminary which had become national property and there educated young girls and trained them for work. In 1810, the building became a prison for Spanish prisoners of war. The sisters took up nursing in the prison hospital. Javouhey contracted typhus but recovered. In 1812, Javouhey bought them the former Recollects monastery at Cluny.\\"History of Anne-Marie Javouhey\\", Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny, November 10, 2018 This convent became their motherhouse until 1849. Javouhey also opened workshops and a home for war widows. Missions In 1817, Javouhey was invited to open a school on √éle Bourbon, in the Indian Ocean. In 1819 she established a mission presence at Saint-Louis, Senegal and in Gor√©e, Senegal, where she focused on improving the hospitals.Brockman, Norbert C., \\"Javouhey, Anne Marie \\", Dictionary of African Christian Biography Her first attempt to develop an African clergy, was to found a Christian village, but this effort failed after an epidemic. In 1822, the institute was present in Guyana and Guadeloupe; At the request of the British government, she left for St. Mary's in Gambia, a holding place for about 400 slaves taken from Moorish vessels. There she worked tirelessly to help the victims of an epidemic in the area. The governor then asked her to go to Sierra Leone. Again she focused her efforts on tending to the sick and injured. After three months, there was an outbreak of yellow fever; again Javouhey recovered, but was so very weak that she returned to France.Richardson, Michael. \\"The Adventurous Nun: The Story of Anne-Marie Javouhey\\", Australian Catholic Truth Society #1467, 1965 Once back in France, Javouhey realized that she needed to re-establish control of the mission on √éle Bourbon, and sent her sister Rosalie to take charge. The Institute expanded its work to care for the mentally ill. French Guiana The government of France contacted her to try to establish a colony in the interior of the country of the South American colony of Guiana. After receiving full approval for her plans, Javouhey left with 36 nuns and 50 emigrants. Over time New Angoul√™me turned out not to be a success, and after five years work, she returned to France. In 1828, she returned to the area, at the request of the French government to assist in preparing a group of African slaves for emancipation. The settlement, known as Mana, became quite prosperous and attracted the jealousy of colonists at the mouth of the Acarouany River. A plot was hatched to kill her, but the boatman who was to tip her into the crocodile-infested water could not bring himself to kill her. There were no scenes or other troubles at the emancipation and liberation of this group of slaves as marked similar occasions in other French colonies. By 1841, 400 slaves had been emancipated. She returned to France again in 1843, facing several difficulties, including ecclesiastical opposition. During the Revolution of 1848 Javouhey organized the sisters into a sort of ambulance-brigade to care for the wounded. She and her order continued to establish new mission houses of her order all over the world, including in India, Tahiti, Madagascar, and over 30 foundations in France. Death and canonization She died in Paris in 1851. The cause for her beatification was introduced on February 11, 1908, and she was beatified on October 15, 1950.\\"Anne-Marie Javouhey\\", Pontifical Missionaries Societies Legacy Today the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny numbers close to 3,000 Sisters serving in over 60 countries, including the United States, Canada, India and Ireland.

Top shows several LED flash lights, centre are the lens and PIR sensors. A deer being photographed by a game camera at night. A remote camera, also known as a trail camera or game camera , is a camera placed by a photographer in areas where the photographer generally cannot be at the camera to snap the shutter. This includes areas with limited access, tight spaces where a person is not allowed, or just another angle so that the photographer can simultaneously take pictures of the same moment from different locations. Remote cameras are most widely used in sports photography. 35 mm digital or film, and medium format cameras are the most common types of cameras that are used.  Uses and practices  Professor A.N. Kudaktin examines remote camera for implementation of monitoring of wild animals within the Persian Leopard Reintroduction Program in the Caucasus. Remote cameras are used by photographers to take more pictures from different angles. Remotes are very popular in sports and wildlife photography. Cameras are often placed in angles that a photographer cannot physically be during a shoot. Sport use examples include behind the backboard at a basketball game or overhead in the rafters of an arena during a hockey game.  Placement  Remote cameras placed in suspended positions usually are mounted with clamps and arms such as the Bogen Super Clamp and Variable Friction Arm, often referred to as \\"Magic Arms\\". The camera and lens are connected to the variable friction arm which is attached to the Super Clamp which in turn is secured to a fixed item such as a basketball post, hand railing, or rafter. Ground plates or tripods are typically used for remote cameras placed on the ground.  Triggering  Remote cameras can be fired via hand triggers, sound triggers, proximity sensation, radio transmitters (mainly Bluetooth shutters), or the self-timer built into the camera. For remotes that are in close proximity to the photographer, hand or sound triggers can be used. A hand trigger consists of a button or switch that is connected to the camera via a wire that is set to fire the camera's shutter. For remotes that are placed away from the photographer, radio triggering systems such as the Bluetooth shutter button, Pocket Wizards or Flash Wizards are used. A radio trigger consists of a button or switch that is connected to a radio triggering transmitter or transceiver which is set to fire a radio triggering receiver or transceiver that is connected to the camera via a wire that is set to fire the camera's shutter. For rocket launches, including the Space Shuttle, remote cameras are triggered by the sound of the launch.

LPBoost maximizes a margin between training samples of different classes and hence also belongs to the class of margin- maximizing supervised classification algorithms. Consider a classification function : f: \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\\\\\{ -1, 1 \\\\\\\\}, which classifies samples from a space \\\\mathcal{X} into one of two classes, labelled 1 and -1, respectively. LPBoost is an algorithm to learn such a classification function given a set of training examples with known class labels. LPBoost is a machine learning technique and especially suited for applications of joint classification and feature selection in structured domains.  LPBoost overview  As in all boosting classifiers, the final classification function is of the form :f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\\\alpha_j h_j(\\\\boldsymbol{x}), where \\\\alpha_j are non-negative weightings for weak classifiers h_j: \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\\\\\{-1,1\\\\\\\\}. Each individual weak classifier h_j may be just a little bit better than random, but the resulting linear combination of many weak classifiers can perform very well. LPBoost constructs f by starting with an empty set of weak classifiers. Iteratively, a single weak classifier to add to the set of considered weak classifiers is selected, added and all the weights \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha} for the current set of weak classifiers are adjusted. This is repeated until no weak classifiers to add remain. The property that all classifier weights are adjusted in each iteration is known as totally- corrective property. Early boosting methods, such as AdaBoost do not have this property and converge slower.  Linear program  More generally, let \\\\mathcal{H}=\\\\\\\\{h(\\\\cdot;\\\\omega)  \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega\\\\\\\\} be the possibly infinite set of weak classifiers, also termed hypotheses. One way to write down the problem LPBoost solves is as a linear program with infinitely many variables. The primal linear program of LPBoost, optimizing over the non-negative weight vector \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}, the non-negative vector \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\xi} of slack variables and the margin \\\\rho is the following. :\\\\begin{array}{cl} \\\\underset{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\xi},\\\\rho}{\\\\min} & -\\\\rho + D \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\ell} \\\\xi_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\textrm{sb.t.} & \\\\sum_{\\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega} y_n \\\\alpha_{\\\\omega} h(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n ; \\\\omega) + \\\\xi_n \\\\geq \\\\rho,\\\\qquad n=1,\\\\dots,\\\\ell,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\sum_{\\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega} \\\\alpha_{\\\\omega} = 1,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\xi_n \\\\geq 0,\\\\qquad n=1,\\\\dots,\\\\ell,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\alpha_{\\\\omega} \\\\geq 0,\\\\qquad \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\rho \\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}. \\\\end{array} Note the effects of slack variables \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\xi} \\\\geq 0: their one-norm is penalized in the objective function by a constant factor D, which‚Äîif small enough‚Äîalways leads to a primal feasible linear program. Here we adopted the notation of a parameter space \\\\Omega, such that for a choice \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega the weak classifier h(\\\\cdot ; \\\\omega): \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\\\\\{-1,1\\\\\\\\} is uniquely defined. When the above linear program was first written down in early publications about boosting methods it was disregarded as intractable due to the large number of variables \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}. Only later it was discovered that such linear programs can indeed be solved efficiently using the classic technique of column generation.  Column generation for LPBoost  In a linear program a column corresponds to a primal variable. Column generation is a technique to solve large linear programs. It typically works in a restricted problem, dealing only with a subset of variables. By generating primal variables iteratively and on-demand, eventually the original unrestricted problem with all variables is recovered. By cleverly choosing the columns to generate the problem can be solved such that while still guaranteeing the obtained solution to be optimal for the original full problem, only a small fraction of columns has to be created. = LPBoost dual problem = Columns in the primal linear program corresponds to rows in the dual linear program. The equivalent dual linear program of LPBoost is the following linear program. :\\\\begin{array}{cl} \\\\underset{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda},\\\\gamma}{\\\\max} & \\\\gamma\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\textrm{sb.t.} & \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\ell} y_n h(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n ; \\\\omega) \\\\lambda_n + \\\\gamma \\\\leq 0,\\\\qquad \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & 0 \\\\leq \\\\lambda_n \\\\leq D,\\\\qquad n=1,\\\\dots,\\\\ell,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\ell} \\\\lambda_n = 1,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. \\\\end{array} For linear programs the optimal value of the primal and dual problem are equal. For the above primal and dual problems, the optimal value is equal to the negative 'soft margin'. The soft margin is the size of the margin separating positive from negative training instances minus positive slack variables that carry penalties for margin-violating samples. Thus, the soft margin may be positive although not all samples are linearly separated by the classification function. The latter is called the 'hard margin' or 'realized margin'. = Convergence criterion = Consider a subset of the satisfied constraints in the dual problem. For any finite subset we can solve the linear program and thus satisfy all constraints. If we could prove that of all the constraints which we did not add to the dual problem no single constraint is violated, we would have proven that solving our restricted problem is equivalent to solving the original problem. More formally, let \\\\gamma^* be the optimal objective function value for any restricted instance. Then, we can formulate a search problem for the 'most violated constraint' in the original problem space, namely finding \\\\omega^* \\\\in \\\\Omega as :\\\\omega^* = \\\\underset{\\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega}{\\\\textrm{argmax}} \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\ell} y_n h(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n;\\\\omega) \\\\lambda_n. That is, we search the space \\\\mathcal{H} for a single decision stump h(\\\\cdot;\\\\omega^*) maximizing the left hand side of the dual constraint. If the constraint cannot be violated by any choice of decision stump, none of the corresponding constraint can be active in the original problem and the restricted problem is equivalent. = Penalization constant D = The positive value of penalization constant D has to be found using model selection techniques. However, if we choose D=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\ell u}, where \\\\ell is the number of training samples and 0 < u < 1, then the new parameter u has the following properties. * u is an upper bound on the fraction of training errors; that is, if k denotes the number of misclassified training samples, then \\\\frac{k}{\\\\ell} \\\\leq u. * u is a lower bound on the fraction of training samples outside or on the margin.  Algorithm  * Input: ** Training set X = \\\\\\\\{\\\\boldsymbol{x}_1, \\\\dots, \\\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\\\ell}\\\\\\\\}, \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} ** Training labels Y = \\\\\\\\{y_1,\\\\dots,y_{\\\\ell}\\\\\\\\}, y_i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{-1,1\\\\\\\\} ** Convergence threshold \\\\theta \\\\geq 0 * Output: ** Classification function f: \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\\\\\{-1,1\\\\\\\\} # Initialization ## Weights, uniform \\\\lambda_n \\\\leftarrow \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ell},\\\\quad n=1,\\\\dots,\\\\ell ## Edge \\\\gamma \\\\leftarrow 0 ## Hypothesis count J \\\\leftarrow 1 # Iterate ## \\\\hat h \\\\leftarrow \\\\underset{\\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega}{\\\\textrm{argmax}} \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\ell} y_n h(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n;\\\\omega) \\\\lambda_n ## if \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\ell} y_n \\\\hat h(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n) \\\\lambda_n + \\\\gamma \\\\leq \\\\theta then ### break ## h_J \\\\leftarrow \\\\hat h ## J \\\\leftarrow J + 1 ## (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda},\\\\gamma) \\\\leftarrow solution of the LPBoost dual ## \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha} \\\\leftarrow Lagrangian multipliers of solution to LPBoost dual problem # f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) := \\\\textrm{sign} \\\\left(\\\\sum_{j=1}^J \\\\alpha_j h_j (\\\\boldsymbol{x})\\\\right) Note that if the convergence threshold is set to \\\\theta = 0 the solution obtained is the global optimal solution of the above linear program. In practice, \\\\theta is set to a small positive value in order obtain a good solution quickly.  Realized margin  The actual margin separating the training samples is termed the realized margin and is defined as :\\\\rho(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}) := \\\\min_{n=1,\\\\dots,\\\\ell} y_n \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha_{\\\\omega} \\\\in \\\\Omega} \\\\alpha_{\\\\omega} h(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n ; \\\\omega). The realized margin can and will usually be negative in the first iterations. For a hypothesis space that permits singling out of any single sample, as is commonly the case, the realized margin will eventually converge to some positive value.  Convergence guarantee  While the above algorithm is proven to converge, in contrast to other boosting formulations, such as AdaBoost and TotalBoost, there are no known convergence bounds for LPBoost. In practise however, LPBoost is known to converge quickly, often faster than other formulations.  Base learners  LPBoost is an ensemble learning method and thus does not dictate the choice of base learners, the space of hypotheses \\\\mathcal{H}. Demiriz et al. showed that under mild assumptions, any base learner can be used. If the base learners are particularly simple, they are often referred to as decision stumps. The number of base learners commonly used with Boosting in the literature is large. For example, if \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\subseteq {\\\\mathbb R}^n, a base learner could be a linear soft margin support vector machine. Or even more simple, a simple stump of the form :h(\\\\boldsymbol{x} ; \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,-1\\\\\\\\}, p \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}, t \\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}) := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{cl} \\\\omega & \\\\textrm{if~} \\\\boldsymbol{x}_p \\\\leq t\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\omega & \\\\textrm{otherwise}\\\\end{array}\\\\right.. The above decision stumps looks only along a single dimension p of the input space and simply thresholds the respective column of the sample using a constant threshold t. Then, it can decide in either direction, depending on \\\\omega for a positive or negative class. Given weights for the training samples, constructing the optimal decision stump of the above form simply involves searching along all sample columns and determining p, t and \\\\omega in order to optimize the gain function.

At the 2001 census, it had a population of 8,534. Culcheth Historically part of Lancashire, the area was dense woodland until the Norman conquest, hence the village gets its name from the Celtic for \\"narrow wood\\". Bronze Age pottery discovered at Croft suggests the area was inhabited 4,000 years ago. The Culcheth family played an important role in shaping village fortunes. Gilbert de Culcheth was lord of the manor of Culcheth and built its first hall in 1200. He was survived by a son Hugh de Gilbert and four daughters. Hugh de Gilbert was murdered by a group of twelve angry men in 1246, leaving no male heir. This saw the land divided between daughters Margery, Elizabeth, Ellen and Joan. However, equality was unheard of and land could not be passed down to women. The responsibility for the girls went to the Baron of Warrington who married off all the girls to his four sons. Eldest girl Margery, married Richard who took the name de Culcheth to ensure its survival. Each couple lived in their own sector of the Manor - Culcheth, Holcroft, Risley and Peasfurlong. Religion played an important role. As Catholics during the Reformation, services took place under complete secrecy in the family chapel which priests would enter through a secret passage by the fireplace in the great hall, and exit at a secluded spot on the tree-lined drive. The Culcheths supported Charles I in the Civil War, whilst their neighbours and enemies the Holcrofts backed Cromwell and the Parliamentarians. The Culcheth name died out with Thomas Culcheth (who died in 1747) being the last. He had no heir, so the hall passed to his cousin Thomas Stanley and then to John Trafford, which is where the family line ends. The Holcroft family also have some notoriety for a scandal involving the daughter of Lt-Col John Holcroft who was an officer in Cromwell's army. His daughter, Maria, married Irishman Lieutenant Thomas Blood against Holcroft's wishes. They married on 16 June 1650 in Newchurch before moving to Ireland. At the end of the civil war, Cromwell promoted Blood to the rank of Captain. Three years later he was elevated to Commissioner of Parliament. Blood is most famous for devising a plot to steal the Crown Jewels from the Tower of London and using them as a ransom for Charles II. In 1671 he and Maria disguised themselves as a parson and his wife. They visited the keeper of the jewels and Maria pretended to faint to cause a distraction. The keeper unlocked the Crown Jewels and, to his amazement, was seized and held in the strongroom. Just as Blood and his accomplice were leaving, the plan was hindered yet again since they were caught before even getting out of the grounds of the Tower. The King took pity on Blood and, after serving a short sentence, he was returned to Ireland and his estate where he and Maria lived on a ¬£500 a year allowance. The lordship of the manor of Culcheth and Culcheth Hall were latterly owned by the Withington family. The hall was demolished after the Second World War and the estate has been developed as residential housing by Adam Lythgoe (Estates) Ltd. Glazebury Hurst Hall Before the Civil War, Glazebury was part of Culcheth, and known as Hurst because of Hurst Hall.North Barn, Hurst Hall This is Cheshire It was formerly the seat of the Holcroft family, before the Adamsonswww.AdamsonAncestry.com lived there during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Anthony Emery in Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300-1500: East Anglia, Central England and Wales commented upon Hurst Hall's four-bay hall,www.medievalarchitecture.net although most of the medieval structure was demolished in 1975; it is now the site of a garden centre. The village name is unusual as the ending \\"bury\\" in English place names usually signifies a fortified place. However Hurst became known as Glazebury in a different way. In the 17th century Civil War combatants were buried in a road which became known as Bury Lane (now part of Warrington Road) and Glazebury is believed to take its name from a combination of bury and the word glaze from the nearby Glaze Brook. The village has a parish church, primary schoolGlazebury C of E (Aided) Primary School. Axcis. Official Website. and cricket clubGlazebury Cricket Club.

It has several common names including guasca (Colombia), mielcilla (Costa Rica), galinsoga (New Zealand), gallant soldier, quickweed, and potato weed (United Kingdom, United States).  History  Galinsoga parviflora was brought from Peru to Kew Gardens in 1796, and later escaped to the wild in Great Britain and Ireland, being temporarily known as the 'Kew Weed'. The plant is named after the Spanish botanist Ignacio Mariano Martinez de Galinsoga. The species name 'parviflora' translates to 'having small flowers'. In Britain, its name Galinsoga is sometimes popularly rendered as \\"gallant soldiers\\", and then sometimes altered to \\"soldiers of the Queen\\". In Malawi, where the plant is naturalised, it is known as 'Mwamuna aligone' which translates to 'My husband is sleeping'.  Uses  In Colombia it is used as a spice herb in the soup Ajiaco.B & T World Seeds, Tridax parviflora (Galinsoga parviflora) in Profile includes photo plus recipe for soup containing this plant as an ingredient It can also be used as an ingredient in leaf salads, although its subtle flavour, reminiscent of artichoke, mostly develops after being cooked. In eastern Africa, the plant is collected from the wild, and its leaves, stem and flowers eaten. It is also dried and ground into powder for use in soups. Description Galinsoga parviflora grows to a height of 75 cm (30 inches). It is a branched herb with opposite stalked leaves, toothed at the margins. The flowers are in small heads. The 3‚Äì8 white ray-florets are about 1 mm (0.4 inches) long and 3-lobed.

He was an East Frankish vassal titled comes (count), and is believed to have ruled between 861 or 864 and 876. Life Kocelj was the second son of Pribina, a Moravian Slavic dux installed by the Franks in Lower Pannonia in ca. 838 or 840. Bowlus believes he was born in ca. 820. In 861, Kocelj made a significant donation to the Freising monastery, showing that he had a solid social and political standing. According to Bowlus, this document indicates that Pribina had died, and Kocelj succeeded him. Louis the German installed Kocel as a ruler in Lower Pannonia in 864. Kocelj held \\"Lower Pannonia\\" (Pannonia inferioris) in 865, when Archbishop Adalwin of Salzburg visited his lands twice. In 869, Kocel had requested for Byzantine missionary Methodius to be sent into Pannonia as a papal legate. In midsummer, Kocelj sent Methodius to Rome with twenty men to petition for his elevation to bishop. Hadrian II appointed Methodius the archbishop of Sirmium, and sent confirmations to, among others, Kocel, whose land lay within the jurisdiction. Frankish Pannonia was held by Kocel and Bavarian margraves in 871; Kocel enjoyed independence, as evident from his talks with the pope. In 874, following the Moravian conflict, Kocel continued to rule the Drava Valley, presumably under Carloman of the March of Pannonia. Kocelj disappears from sources after 874, and was either dead or removed from his office in ca. 876, certainly dead by 880.

Species of Rapistrum are annual to perennials (Lifespan from 1 to 2 or more years). The yellow petals are accompanied by sepals that stand vertically at near right angles (erecto- patent). Leaf shape and arrangement varies from rough toothed (dentate) to a configuration of opposingly lobed pairs along the plant stalk, pinnately lobed. Fruit The genus Rapistrum has a characteristic fruit comprising two segments: a) The distal (upper division) The part of the fruit farthest away from the point of attachment. The distal is endowed with a ribbed spheroid base (globose) that tapers to form a narrowed projection. It holds a single seed. b) The proximal (lower division) The part of the fruit nearest to the point of attachment. Possesses a more uniform narrower shape compared to the distal above, giving the fruit a waist. It holds a maximum of three seeds, more commonly none or one. The fruit varies from species to species. The distal of R. rugosum is strongly ribbed and narrows to form a beak whereas R. perenne is comparatively less wrinkled and ends with a style that stubbornly resists detachment, 'a persistent style'. When ripe the distal breaks away in an across-wise fashion, breaking transversely. References *. *.

The village's earliest recording was as Mora, some time in the 12th century. Located midway between Runcorn and Warrington, its notable buildings are the village farmhouse, dating from the middle of the 17th century and Moore Hall, a five-bay manor house, dating from the early 18th century. Railway stations Moore is the site of a disused railway station named Daresbury. The railway station was opened in 1850 and was located on the south side of Runcorn Road. The station was closed to passengers in 1952 and closed completely in 1965. The platforms and ramps down from road are still visible from Runcorn Road. The railway station was situated on the Birkenhead Joint Railway close to Warrington and in the village of Moore. The railway station was the second to open in the village. The first railway station which was very close by was part of the Grand Junction Railway which opened on 4 July 1837. Moore was a second class station at which a First Class train would not stop.

For season by season results see Seasons Foundation and the attaining of senior status (1913‚Äì29) In 1913, eleven years after their creation, Derry Celtic were voted out of senior soccer in Ireland. This left the city of Derry without a senior team ‚Äì a situation which was to last for some time. It was a period lengthened as a result of the First World War, the Easter Rising, and the partition of Ireland. The division of the country led to the creation of two football leagues when the clubs south of the border broke away from the Irish Football Association (IFA) and their Irish League to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State (FAIFS, later to become the FAI) and Free State League. With Derry being a part of Northern Ireland post-partition, any club in the city would have fallen under the jurisdiction of the Irish Football Association. The people of Derry were irate that a city of its size did not have a senior team, especially when near-neighbours Coleraine, with only a quarter the population of Derry, had been elected to the Irish League in the mid-twenties. In 1928, a group of football fans got together to rectify this situation and decided that the name of Derry Celtic would not satisfy their cross-community, non-sectarian requirements so they settled on the name Derry City. At the time, the dispute over the city's official name had not yet become as politicised as it would in later years. On 9 May 1928, Derry City affiliated to the North-West Football Association and, in a link with the past, Norman McClure son of a Derry Celtic director, was appointed the club's secretary. On 25 May 1928, William Arthur led a delegation to a meeting of the Irish Senior Leagues Committee (ISLC) to attempt to secure Derry's senior status. Along with Crusaders F.C. and Brantwood F.C., Derry City's application was rejected. The Belfast clubs were not considered to be of senior quality, while Derry's application had been received two days after the deadline. The directors returned to Derry disappointed but determined. The next year saw them preparing for the inevitable move from amateur to senior status ‚Äì their confidence buoyed by the fact that after they failed to apply by the requisite deadline, a motion at the ISLC to waive the deadline was only defeated by 17 votes to 15. The president of the IFA, Captain James Wilton, a Derry-man, announced on 30 May 1929 that he felt confident that Derry City would be admitted to the Irish League, which since 1922, had covered only Northern Ireland, the following night. During the final of the local McAlinden Cup being played between Derry Celtic and Richmond in the Brandywell on Friday 31 May 1929, the announcement that Derry City had achieved senior status was greeted with a chorus of cheers and applause. Queen's Island were voted out at the expense of Derry. Joe McCleery, a native of the city, was enticed from his managerial post in Dundalk with Dundalk F.C. to become Derry's first manager and he quickly signed Fred Mason from his former club. The big Birmingham-born player settled well in the team and city, eventually establishing Mason's bar in Magazine Street after his playing career ended. Plans to purchase a pitch fell through due to the tight timescales and so the Londonderry Corporation was approached for the use of the Brandywell Stadium which had been used for football up until the end of the 19th century. This began an association between the club and the ground which has survived until the present day. The club are still operating under the constraints of the Honourable the Irish Society charter limitations which declare that the Brandywell must be available for the recreation of the community. In effect, the club do not have private ownership over the ground and, thus, cannot develop it by their own accord with that discretion left to the Derry City Council (formerly the Londonderry Corporation). The early years in the Irish League (1929‚Äì49) { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;\\"  class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"padding: 0; background: #FFFFFF;\\"  }On 22 August 1929, Derry City ran on to the Brandywell turf for the first time in claret and blue shirts with white shorts. McCleery's full-time professionals led Glentoran F.C. by a score of 1‚Äì0 at half-time with a goal from Peter Burke ‚Äì a recent recruit from the Free State Army. The attendance of 7,500 saw a Derry team captained by Con Hilley lose that lead in the second half and leave the pitch without any points after Glentoran's second-half brace. Their trip to Portadown resulted in Derry's first hat-trick in senior football through Sammy Curran, but they still managed to lose 6‚Äì5 in an enthralling game. Their first point in senior football came soon after a 1‚Äì1 draw in the Brandywell against Ballymena F.C; and a crowd of 12,000 saw Derry get their first cup-game win when they beat the dominant Linfield F.C. side 3‚Äì1 in the Gold Cup. On 7 September the Brandywell club gained their first league victory with a 3‚Äì2 win over Newry Town at the home of the County Down club. It was not until 5 October 1929 that the Brandywell faithful witnessed Derry's first league victory on home turf when Derry beat Cliftonville F.C. 4‚Äì3. They ended the season in an admirable fifth place, and came third in the City Cup. However, it was not an easy start for the Foylesiders and it certainly was not going to be an easy ride at any stage in the Irish League. The following year, McCleery signed Derry's first legend. Jimmy Kelly, born in Ballybofey, schooled in the Derry and District FA, and polished in the Anfield training grounds, returned to Derry and played his first game on 26 October 1930 against Linfield at Windsor Park. It took him four matches to get on the scoresheet. That goal against Glenavon F.C. was the first of 363 for Derry City in a career spanning almost 21 years. During that time he was capped by the IFA, the FAIFS, the Irish League and the League of Ireland. His arrival though did not inspire Derry who ended the 1930‚Äì31 league campaign in seventh place. The next season saw a brief upturn in their fortunes, which could very well have been directly related to Derry's signing of the club's second superstar. E.D.R. Shearer pulled on the Derry shirt for the first time at the Coleraine Showgrounds in a career spanning eight seasons with the club. With three games of the 1931‚Äì32 season remaining, Derry were top of the table, level with Glentoran, but managed to lose all three games and ended up in fourth place. It was gutting to end the season in such a way, especially as they had scored 107 goals. Rumours of McCleery's demise began to circulate. In June 1932, McCleery was sacked despite the fact he had just had his most successful season at the helm. The directors also decided to introduce Derry's second strip at the end of the season ‚Äì white shirts and black shorts. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;\\"  class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"padding: 0; background: #FFFFFF;\\"  } A Donegal man, Billy Gillespie, was given the nod as McCleery's replacement after 20 years playing at Sheffield United. Gillespie did not have a great start and could only help the club to another fourth-place finish in 1933. This was the second year in which ground purchase was mentioned. The board decided against buying Bond's Field in the Waterside as it was thought to be too far away from the fan base which had built up on the Cityside, especially in the Brandywell area. They had first option on Derry Celtic's old ground, Celtic Park, but hesitated on a final decision and the Gaelic Athletic Association bought it ten years later. They also decided not to purchase Meenan Park for ¬£1,500. In 1934 the club came ninth and so the dismissal of McCleery was looking worse by the season. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;\\"  class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"padding: 0; background: #FFFFFF;\\"  } Shortly before the 1934‚Äì35 season, the directors decided on another change of strip. They decided on the red and white striped shirts and black shorts of Sheffield United as a tribute to Billy Gillespie who, despite his less-than-impressive managerial performance, was still an extremely popular figure throughout Ireland and especially the north-western region, due to his international performances for the Irish football team. This was to be the jersey that was to become synonymous with Derry City for the next seventy years, the only break being a period of wearing gold and black in the late 1950s. It was in the \\"candy-striped\\" top that Derry lifted their first major trophy. Having won the North-West Senior Cup in 1931‚Äì32, 1932‚Äì33, and 1933‚Äì34, they went a step further and in front of 9,000 at Brandywell ‚Äì Hugh Carlyle lifted the old Dunville trophy for Derry City as winners of the City Cup by a clear 5 points over 12 games. Derry were to repeat this feat in 1937 but it was not until 12 years later that they were to lift another major trophy, having also lost an Irish Cup final replay to Linfield in 1936. By 1947‚Äì48, the directors were seriously considering Derry's future as the club had entered a demise in the previous decade and were no longer as feared as they once were. However, luckily, then-manager Willie Ross took advantage of having found a considerable sum of money to spend after the sale of players Eddie Crossan and John Feeney resulted in an annual profit of ¬£2,000 ‚Äì a figure most Irish clubs would have jumped at in the days of red bank balances. This enabled the club to carry on and keep astute on the transfer market. In 1949 the club won the Irish Cup for the first time.\\"The Great Cup Breakthrough \\", CityWeb, 2007. Derry were reduced to 10 men in the final at Windsor Park on 16 April 1949 when Jimmy Kelly was stretchered off. After the opponents, Glentoran, went in front, Hugh Colvan and Matt Doherty put Derry ahead. The team doctor cured Kelly's concussion and the 10,000 Derry supporters roared him back on to the field of play 15 minutes after he had been carried off. Barney Cannon's goal seven minutes from time meant that the 27,000 in attendance saw the Irish Cup going to Derry for the first time. The fair fifties and the swinging sixties (1949‚Äì65) A few years of failure resulted in apathy within the city and by the time another legendary figure in the form of a past Scottish-international was signed in January 1954, memories of the 1949 silverware had gone. Even in 1954 the club came third from bottom, although the signing of Jimmy Delaney, formerly of Celtic and Manchester United, did provide a shining light. Derry's club doctor, Desmond Sidebottom had heard he wanted to settle in Ireland so Derry pounced and secured one of the greatest players ever to play on Irish soil. That year Derry met Glentoran, who were favourites just as they had been in 1949, once again in the Irish Cup final. The first final ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw; the replay was a scoreless draw; and the second replay in front of a crowd of 28,000 saw Derry win 1‚Äì0 with a Con O'Neill strike from a Delaney assist. At the final whistle the players rushed to celebrate with Delaney but the Scot ran the length of the field to celebrate with and thank Charlie Heffron in the Derry goal who had thwarted Glentoran's attacks time and time again. Together, the three finals saw 93,000 attend ‚Äì a figure unimaginable in today's domestic Irish soccer. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;\\"  class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"padding: 0; background: #FFFFFF;\\"  } In the late 50s Derry lost some of their more popular figures: Jobby Crossan left for Coleraine after he had turned down Nottingham Forest; Jim McLaughlin went to Birmingham City F.C.; and Matt Doherty Jr. moved to Glentoran. Meanwhile, the club brought in Fay Coyle from Coleraine as they reverted to part-time status with the 1961 abolishment of the maximum wage in football. In 1964 Derry City lifted the Gold Cup and the Irish Cup once again, after having beaten Glentoran in the final for a third time. Another club hero was signed on 30 June 1964 ‚Äì Belfast-man, Jimmy McGeough, came to Derry from Stockport County. Matt Doherty Jr. returned and yet another star, Willie Curran, made his debut that season. Derry set off on an unbeaten run of 47 games that year that was to span two seasons. Steaua Bucure≈üti beat Derry 5‚Äì0 on aggregate in the European Cup Winners Cup the following year but the club made up for the disappointment by becoming the Irish League champions for the only time in their history. In April 1965 a 5‚Äì1 victory over Ards in the Brandywell saw 34-goal captain, Fay Coyle, lift the league trophy in front of a packed Brandywell. Within weeks, Doug Wood was named 'Northern Ireland Player of the Year' and Derry performed admirably in a 3‚Äì1 friendly defeat to a Spanish 1966 World Cup preparation select in Madrid's Vicente Calder√≥n Stadium. The Spanish team had invited Derry to Madrid as they were soon to face Ireland in the qualifying rounds for the competition scheduled to take place on English soil, so they were anxious to test themselves against a team that was likely to possess a similar style of play. The following season, Derry became the first Irish League team to win a European tie over two legs by beating FK Lyn in the European Cup when, after losing 5‚Äì3 in the Oslo, they won 8‚Äì6 on aggregate.\\"Derry City vs FK Lyn \\", CityWeb, 2007. The return leg in the Brandywell had played in very bad weather. It had rained incessantly from the previous day, but that did not prevent a full house from watching Derry City win 5‚Äì1. The fans went home drenched but delighted. However, what they did not know was that there were forces at work who would deny Derry their night of glory. The Second Round was not to come to the Brandywell as the IFA prevented the use of the ground, using the excuse that the pitch was not up to standard, even though a game had been played there during the previous round. With sectarianism taking a foothold in Northern Ireland in the run-up to the advent of the Troubles, Derry suspected that such motives may have been at play, because Derry played in a mainly nationalist area and so had come to be supported mostly by Catholics, while the IFA represented a cultural focal point of Protestant Northern Ireland. Seeing a team from a mainly-nationalist city being the first Irish League club to progress was a bitter pill to swallow for Harry Cavan, the president of the IFA. Derry stated that they would stand their ground in the face of this and refuse to travel elsewhere to play the tie after requesting advice on how to make the ground suitable but receiving no answer. The ban was simply re-inforced. The IFA wanted their representatives to play the tie in Belfast, although, in what seemed like a case of double standards, they deemed the Showgrounds in mainly-Protestant Coleraine suitable also, despite the fact that the grounds were in much the same state as the Brandywell. After Derry had told the IFA that they would not play or represent the Irish League in Europe without a lifting of the ban, R.S.C. Anderlecht, the upcoming opponents, who had been prepared to play at the Brandywell, pleaded with Derry to play the tie and so Derry travelled to Belgium and were hammered 9‚Äì0. Even though Anderlecht officials visited Derry to analyse the Brandywell pitch and declared that their club would have no problem playing at the Brandywell for the return game, a second leg was never played, with the fixture being announced as a walk-over due to the withdrawal of Derry. Playing the second leg would have been, more or less, a futile effort anyway with such a vast deficit to recover, while the IFA were not prepared to let the game go ahead in Derry regardless after having recommended to the European Football Union that the Brandywell Stadium be banned from hosting the game. Incidentally, the European Football Union had not objected to Derry City using the Brandywell for the game either and left the decision within the discretion of the IFA. Relations between Derry and the IFA never improved. Security concerns during the 'Troubles' (Late 1960s‚Äì1985) Up until the late 1960s most teams' journey to the Brandywell would have been of little consequence. However, 1969 was the beginning of the Troubles. As the situation in Northern Ireland deteriorated, football matches between certain teams with nationalist and unionist support respectively began to echo the wider trouble of the time. City's ground, the Brandywell Stadium, was located in a republican area of Derry and the club was associated with the Catholic and nationalist community in the city.\\"Catholics and Sport in Northern Ireland: Exclusiveness or Inclusiveness?\\", Mike Cronin, De Montfort University, Leicester, England, 2000. For a time, the area was beyond the reach of the police and Army. During the late 1960s and early 1970s the locality surrounding the Brandywell saw some of the worst violence of the Troubles. The Brandywell first fell prey to this on 25 January 1969, when a match versus Linfield F.C. was marred by crowd trouble. Fans of the Belfast team had to be evacuated from the stadium by police at half-time after ugly scenes within the ground. The months that followed saw the general political situation decline into civil disorder at locations across Northern Ireland, including areas in the vicinity of the Brandywell. The stadium was located in the centre of one of the most unstable zones. Because of the disturbances, numerous clubs were reluctant to play matches there and some of Derry's home games were moved by the IFA who felt that the inability of the security force to police the games adequately was unacceptable. Linfield declared that they would no longer travel to the city for matches on security grounds, and for the next two seasons Derry were instead forced to play 'home' games against them at Linfield's Windsor Park. The game on 25 January was to be the last game played at the Brandywell between Linfield and Derry until 2005. Despite the social and political turmoil of the day, on the field Derry still managed to perform as usual. Danny Hale finished the 1968‚Äì69 season as the Irish League's top scorer with a tally of 21 goals while the club also managed to make their way to the Irish Cup final in 1971, although they were beaten 3‚Äì0 by Distillery with Martin O'Neill scoring twice for the winners. However, events off the field took an even greater turn for the worse for Derry City in September 1971. With large chunks of the city a 'no-go area' for the security forces, a gang of youths hijacked the bus of a visiting team, Ballymena United, outside the Brandywell before a league game and burned it. As a result, most other Irish League teams joined Linfield in refusing to play fixtures at the Brandywell and the Royal Ulster Constabulary further consolidated this refusal by ruling that it was unsafe for matches to take place there. As a result, Derry City were forced to travel to Coleraine, which was over 30 miles away, in order to play their 'home' games at the Showgrounds. They had initially inquired as to the availability of a ground in Limavady but permission was refused, while the IFA insisted that they could not make use of Finn Park in Ballybofey as it was in the Republic of Ireland. With no other major ground in the local area available, Coleraine was a last resort. This unsustainable situation lasted until October 1972 when, faced with dwindling crowds and dire finances, the club formally requested permission from the Irish League to return to the Brandywell. Portadown F.C. also entered a proposal to return to playing at the Brandywell. Despite an assessment by the security forces which concluded that the Brandywell was no more dangerous than any other ground in the league and the resulting lifting of the imposed ban, City's proposal fell by a single vote at the hands of their fellow Irish League teams who remained unwilling to travel there. Portadown, Bangor, Cliftonville, Ballymena United, and Derry City voted in favour of the motion while Crusaders, Ards, Glenavon, Glentoran, Distillery, and Linfield all voted against. Coleraine abstained and so with a majority of one vote. Derry, devastated by the outcome, withdrew from senior football the next day. The club lived on as a junior team during a period that became known as the \\"wilderness years\\".,\\"My team ‚Äì Derry City by Martin McGuinness \\", The Guardian, 8 April 2001. plying their trade in the local Saturday Morning League to survive, whilst simultaneously seeking re-admission to the Irish League on a number of occasions over the following 13 years. Each time, the club nominated the Brandywell as its chosen home ground. Each time, the Irish League refused to re-admit them, despite significant improvements in the overall security situation over the years. Derry then decided to turn their attentions elsewhere in spite of their affiliation to the Irish Football Association by jurisdiction. Admission into the League of Ireland, instant progress and ensuing success (1985‚Äìpresent) Having formerly played in the Irish Football League which, since 1922, covers only Northern Ireland and with the club's almost annual applications to re-join that league being rejected season after season, Derry applied to join the rejuvenated League of Ireland (the Republic of Ireland's football league at the time) in 1985 with the Brandywell Stadium as their home ground. People such as Terry Harkin, Tony O'Doherty, Eamon McLaughlin and Eddie Mahon, having worked on the visionary project since 1983, helped in the bid to secure senior status once again for Derry City with an election to the League of Ireland's First Division in May 1985. However, the IFA still saw the chance to thwart Derry City once again. The FIFA vice-president (also the IFA's president), Harry Cavan, who had been instrumental in banning the Brandywell from being used for European competition in 1964, claimed that FIFA rules did not permit Derry crossing the border to play in the league of another country. In Dublin, people were undecided about admitting a club from a city with a recent history of political problems but the Finn Harps chairman, Fran Fields, fully backed Derry's application and Glentoran chairman, John Crossen, was another prominent supporter of Derry's move as he felt that the time had come for the IFA to refrain from acting as they had done previously. Others within the Irish League were also in favour of Derry's move as they no longer wanted to have to deal with the club's annual application for re-election to the Irish League. The Irish League and the League of Ireland met in Dundalk in August 1984 and agreed to talk again. This meeting came shortly after Derry hosted Shamrock Rovers in the Brandywell friendly in front of 4,000 fans. Eventually the IFA relented but, knowing that other clubs would want to follow Derry south of the border, they said that they would give permission only to Derry City Football Club to apply to join the League of Ireland. After another successful series of friendlies against Irish teams, Dundalk FC and St. Patrick's Athletic, Derry were informed that they would be accepted into the newly formed First Division, on the provision that the Irish League did not object, and FIFA would sanction such a move. The IFA eventually stated they would not stand in the way if FIFA gave the go-ahead. Neither FIFA nor their subordinate European organisation, UEFA, objected and gave the Derry club special permission to play in the League of Ireland. With no further hurdles standing in the way, Derry City joined the Republic's league, the League of Ireland, in the newly created League of Ireland First Division in 1985 as a semi-professional outfit (although they did adopt professional football while Noel King was in charge between late-1985 and 1987). However, if they thought that this would provide an escape from the marginalisation and sectarian politics in Northern Irish football, they would have to think again ‚Äì Derry's supporters' buses often came under attack from sectarian gangs with stones and other missiles as they travelled through loyalist areas en route to away games in the Republic of Ireland. On occasion, buses still take a detour in order to avoid potential trouble-spots ‚Äì especially on the days of high-profile games. Nevertheless, the city responded in their thousands. Jim Crossan had been appointed manager and he made Terry Kelly his team-captain. Derry's first match in the League of Ireland was played at the Brandywell on 8 September 1985 and saw Derry beat Home Farm of Dublin by a score of 3‚Äì1.\\"Derry City 3 ‚Äì 1 Home Farm \\", CityWeb, 2007. The game itself was actually played as part of the League Cup. Barry McCreadie was Derry's first goal-scorer that day. The club's first League of Ireland hat-trick came when Kevin Mahon fired three past Finn Harps at Finn Park on 15 December 1985. Jim Crossan did not remain in charge of the team for long, however, and his quick departure by the end of 1985 allowed new manager Noel King to bring worldly flair to the Brandywell in the form of the Brazilian, Nelson da Silva, and South African, Owen Da Gama. A throwback to Derry's Irish League days saw Declan McDowell solidify the defence while Kevin Mahon worked wonders on the wing. With another local favourite, Tony O'Doherty, in midfield, the club went on to clinch the League of Ireland First Division Shield in their first season of football in the Republic of Ireland with a 6‚Äì1 aggregate victory over Longford Town FC.\\"Historic Shield Victory for City \\", CityWeb, 2007. The following season, Derry left Shelbourne F.C. in their wake as they won the First Division and promotion to the Premier Division in 1987.\\"First League Title in LOI \\", CityWeb, 2007. Alex Krstic, with his 18 goals, ended the season as the First Division's top scorer. The 1987‚Äì88 season, Derry's first in the League of Ireland Premier Division, saw Jonathan Speak finish top of the scoring chart with 24 goals to his name. Derry's accession to the League of Ireland was greeted with great enthusiasm in the city and the club attracted huge crowds by local standards for several years. The recruitment of a number of high- profile, exotic players from abroad, such as Nelson da Silva, Owen Da Gama, Dennis Tueart and Luther Blissett, also attracted large crowds to the games.\\"My team ‚Äì Derry City by Martin McGuinness \\", The Guardian, 8 April 2001.\\"Past Players ‚Äì Luther Blissett \\", Watford Football Club Online. Buoyed by this support and motivated by hunger after an FAI Cup final defeat in 1988 to Dundalk, the most successful manager in the history of the League of Ireland, Derry-born Jim McLaughlin, helped the club to a historic treble ‚Äì the League Cup, the League Title and the FAI Cup ‚Äì in the 1988‚Äì89 season. Subsequently, Derry qualified for European competition and past European Cup winners, Benfica, came to play at the Brandywell in the following season's First Round of the European Cup. The game evoked great public interest and only helped publicise the club further. Since then, Derry have only won the League championship once in 1996‚Äì97, but have been runners-up on several occasions ‚Äì in the 1994‚Äì95, 2005 and 2006 seasons. They also added three more FAI Cups to their trophy-tally in 1995, 2002 and 2006. In 1994 and 1997 they were runners-up in the FAI Cup. The League of Ireland Cup competition has also brought Derry much success ‚Äì they won the trophy in 1991, 1992, 1994, 2000, 2005 and 2006, as well as in the 1989 treble-winning season. To add to this, Derry once memorably beat Celtic by a score of 3‚Äì2 at Lansdowne Road during the Irish International Club Tournament, which took place in 1997, and made their Sky Sports television debut appearance after qualifying for the final which was to be broadcast live by the company.\\"Derry City 3 ‚Äì 2 Celtic \\",The Irish Times, 16 July 1997. On 7 October 1998, high-profile French footballer David Ginola and Irish goalkeeper offered their services to play for a Derry City Select XI in a charity match in order to raise funds for Omagh's redevelopment after the town was bombed by the IRA earlier that year. The opposition that day, a Mick McCarthy Select XI, composed of players such as John Aldridge, Steve Staunton and Packie Bonner. Ginola is remembered for scoring a cheeky dink from a penalty which he sent straight down the middle of the goal after feigning and tricking the keeper into diving to the side. This was followed by a smug grin directed toward the 10,000-strong crowd ‚Äì not at all in the spirit of sombre commemoration of the atrocity.\\"Derry City Select 5 ‚Äì Mick McCarthy Select 2 \\", Irish Examiner, 7 October 1998. Due to the historical political situation in Northern Ireland, the fact that the Brandywell Stadium is situated in a largely nationalist area, and the long- term continuing existence of a degree of scepticism within that community towards a police service perceived as being a continuation of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Derry's home games remain unique in that they are not policed by a state security force (the Police Service of Northern Ireland or PSNI) ‚Äì rather, Derry City employs its own voluntary and private stewards to overlook matches.\\"Football: Sectarianism \\", Eugene McMenamin MLA, Northern Ireland Assembly Reports, 3 July 2000.\\"PSNI help with UEFA Cup security\\", BBC Sport Online, 22 September 2006. Every other club in the League of Ireland has a Garda presence (the Republic of Ireland's police force) at their stadiums. Derry had to receive special dispensation from UEFA back in 1985 as it was felt that the presence of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in areas like the Brandywell would be more likely to provoke trouble than help prevent it. This policy has proven effective, and for the last 20 years the Brandywell has peacefully entertained crowds of up to 10,000 without a single police officer present. However, the policy has also had the effect of further solidifying Derry's identity as a nationalist club and further alienated a number of its original or potential Protestant supporters. Nevertheless, the political situation in Northern Ireland is improving, largely due to the peace process and the subsequent Good Friday Agreement, and recent games against teams with unionist fanbases ‚Äì such as Linfield ‚Äì have passed off without major incident within the ground,\\"Football's last great taboo?\\", Steve Bradley, ESPN, 22 February 2005. although minor trouble did flare outside the ground on one occasion after a friendly game (which was also somewhat of a security trial) in 2005 in preparation for Derry's likely competing in a near-future Setanta Cup, where the chances of meeting Linfield in a competitive fixture would be very high, when a Linfield supporters' bus in the process of passing through the mainly-nationalist Foyle Road area was pelted with bricks and stones by youths on the road-side.\\"Football fans attacked after game\\", BBC Sport Online, 23 February 2005. With the incident, obviously sectarian in nature, occurring outside the ground and being instigated by individuals who were not actually present at the game, though, the PSNI accepted that it should have been their responsibility to ensure the safe passage of the fans.\\"Police 'failed' to protect fans\\", BBC Sport Online, 23 February 2005. After the match itself having passed off peacefully, Jim Roddy, who was chairman of the club at the time, commented: Both sets of fans had obliged board requests to refrain from bringing to or displaying at the game, overtly political or religious emblems. In the era of building bridges and increasing tolerance, the Brandywell Stadium is usually left free of nationalist symbolism by fans during matches regardless, although Celtic jerseys can often be seen worn by some individuals in attendance. Tricolours are rarely, if ever, hung by official supporter groups unless the club is representing the League of Ireland abroad, for fear of alienating those members of the Protestant community who do actually attend games or to prevent the possibility of turning away potential supporters from that community, as well as in an effort to ensure that everyone is made to feel welcome in the Brandywell regardless of social, political, religious or cultural background. While the debate and political situation as regards the policing of nationalist areas in Northern Ireland is losing heat and becoming less hostile,\\"Positive replies to Blair's views\\", BBC News Online, 4 January 2007. it remains to be thought that the adequacy of Derry's own security personnel discards the need for state policing of games as far as the safety of match-goers is concerned. Financial difficulties and flirtation with relegation (2000‚Äì04) Despite the club's successes, Derry City's path has not always been a smooth one. In September 2000, the club was in a crippled position from a financial perspective and on the verge of bankruptcy due to an unpaid tax bill. The Inland Revenue totalled the debt in the region of ¬£180,000. The position had not been helped as the club was hit with misery on 27 July earlier that same year when the then-chairman, Kevin Friel, was killed in a road accident near Raphoe, Co. Donegal.\\"eircom Park meeting adjourned\\", RT√â.ie, 27 July 2000. Nevertheless, Jim Roddy convened a meeting of the club's shareholders and supporters to inform them that the club had debts nearing ¬£180,000. Prior to that meeting Martin O'Neill, then manager of Scottish giants, Celtic, contacted Roddy, the stand-in chairman, to inform him that he would bring his side to the Brandywell in order to help raise funds for the beleaguered club.\\"O'Neill to bring Celtic to cash-strapped Derry\\", RT√â.ie, 2000-09-12. Retrieved 30 April 2007. A number of other fund raising projects were also put together to help pay of the debts. Local band, the Undertones, played a benefit concert on 29 September, door to door collections took place around the city, while Phil Coulter, a singer from the city, hosted a golf classic on 27 September.\\"Derry City defeated Bohemians tonight in unusual circumstances\\", Johnny Proby, RT√â.ie, 7 September 2000. Significantly, Derry- born politician John Hume, then a Member of the European Parliament for Northern Ireland, also helped by using his contacts in the parliament along with his powers of persuasion to convince a number of former European Cup winners to come to the Brandywell and play friendly matches to raise funds through gate receipts and save the club from extinction.\\"City welcomes arrival of Barcelona team \\", Derry City Council Press Release, 11 August 2003.

The game against Barcelona is fondly remembered on the Brandywell terraces as the day that firm fan-favourite and club legend, Liam Coyle left the Catalan club's Carles Puyol \\"on his arse\\" as he utilised his trickery to beat the defender.\\"Barcelona treat Derry crowd\\", BBC Sport Online, 12 August 2003. The money brought through the turnstiles helped to keep the club in operation, but just about, as results on the field continued to deteriorate and Derry soon came dangerously close to relegation ‚Äì something which would have been a financial nightmare for the club. Although the club has never been relegated, in 2003 it came within a whisker of losing its long-established place in the Premier Division after finishing in 9th position and having to contest a two- legged relegation/promotion play-off with local Donegal rivals, Finn Harps, who had finished 2nd in that season's First Division. However, Derry won the game 2‚Äì1 on aggregate after extra-time in the Brandywell and remained in the top-flight. The second leg of the fixture was the last game ever that veteran, Liam Coyle, played for the club as he announced his retirement soon afterward.\\"Derry legend Coyle retires\\", BBC Sport Online, 16 January 2004. The next season ‚Äì 2004 ‚Äì was not much of an improvement and Derry struggled with relegation once again, finally finishing in 7th position. This poor display led to the sacking of Gavin Dykes, who was the manager at the time since 29 September 2003 after having taken over from Dermot Keely.\\"Derry City unveil Dykes as new boss\\", Ciaran Walsh, RT√â.ie, 29 September 2003. Morale was at an all-time low after a couple of dire seasons. The introduction of full-time professional football and the reign of Stephen Kenny (2004‚Äì06) Fortunes began to improve for the club when team-captain, Peter Hutton, took the role of player-manager for a temporary period until a new permanent manager was found. The club became the first club in Ireland to be awarded a premier UEFA licence in February 2004.\\"First Premier licence is awarded\\", Mark O'Neill- Cummins, RT√â.ie, 28 February 2004. The subsequent appointment of Stephen Kenny as manager later that year and the introduction of full-time football by the club helped these fortunes expand and the club soon began to regain past form. Kenny, later commenting on the situation upon his arrival at the club, said: Kenny insisted his players had to show their commitment by moving to Derry and becoming full-time footballers.Allen, Jeremiah. Ireland News , A2Z Soccer, 2007-03-01. Retrieved 30 April 2007. The rewards were clear as Derry swapped the relegation battles of the previous five seasons by making a serious push for the title while placing themselves in contention for European competitions. In 2005, Kenny's first full season in charge, they finished in second position in the league. The league was lost on the last day in a game against Cork City at Turner's Cross, which had turned out to be the title- decider. Derry went into the game in the top spot and needing anything other than a defeat to secure the title but ended up losing the game, which meant that Cork by-passed them into first place.\\"Cork claim title with Cross win \\", Eleven-a-side.com, 18 November 2005.

The creation of this tournament in 2005 was greatly aided by the lessening of sectarian tensions on the island of Ireland as a whole due to the Northern Ireland peace process and for the first time since their withdrawal from the Irish League in the early 1970s, Derry City hosted competitive matches against Linfield and Glentoran ‚Äì teams with largely unionist fanbases ‚Äì but failed in making it out of the initial group stage, even though they had lost only one game.

Despite the encouraging progress, on 10 November 2006 manager Stephen Kenny announced he would be leaving the club to join Scottish side Dunfermline Athletic F.C. at the end of the 2006 season in order to further his career. His success at Derry had raised eyebrows across the water, and especially in Scotland, after the club's 5‚Äì1 demolition of Gretna on Scottish soil in the Second Qualifying Round of the UEFA Cup. Early speculation linked Joe Kinnear to the soon-to-be-vacant managerial post at Derry City.\\"Kenny to leave Derry City at end of season\\", RT√â.ie, 10 November 2006. Retrieved 4 December 2006.

The cup-win could easily have concluded a historic second treble-winning season. However, Derry just missed out on this after having come second in the eircom League to Shelbourne FC on goal-difference prior to the FAI Cup final. In total, 32 players represented the club under Kenny. His win percentage was 58 per cent while his teams managed to keep 57 clean-sheets out of 112 games.

In the meantime, despite the club being pitted as favourites for the title by numerous bookmakers at the outset of the season, Derry City made a poor start, losing to strong title-contenders St. Patrick's Athletic and Drogheda United in their early-season confrontations. They also fell to Cork City at home in the fifth series of games to a score-line of 4‚Äì1. The last time Derry City conceded four goals at home in the League of Ireland had been when Cork City ran out 4‚Äì1 winners at the Brandywell in April 2000.\\"Four goal Cork heap pressure on Derry boss Fenlon \\", Irish Football Online, 9 April 2007. Having won only three games from nine competitive matches prior to this game, Pat Jennings Jr., the goalkeeper, was viewed as being at fault for quite a number of Derry's conceded goals and was dropped for Ola Tidman to make his debut. Conceding four goals on his debut, however, Tidman also failed to inspire confidence as the club seemed to be missing David Forde following his pre- season departure to Cardiff City. The team in general appeared to be lacking in the drive and tenacity that was once present under Stephen Kenny and were failing to create clear-cut, goal-scoring chances. The loaning out of attacking midfielder, Ciar√°n Martyn, on 31 March 2007, Norwegian top division team Fredrikstad F.K. until 15 July 2007 (with the future option of that club being able to purchase the player for an agreed fee if they so wished) did not help matters, although Derry City did stand to make a considerable profit from the deal and were thus realistically unable to turn it down.\\"Martyn goes on loan \\", CityWeb, 1 April 2007.

Roberts was also released days into his contract after sustaining an injury. History in European competition (1964‚Äìpresent) Derry City have qualified for European football several times throughout the club's history, and more so in recent years. Steaua Bucure≈üti beat the club 5‚Äì1 on aggregate in the European Cup Winners' Cup, during Derry's first European outing in the 1964‚Äì65 season. The following season, Derry became the first Irish League team to win a European tie over two legs by beating Lyn Oslo when, after losing 5‚Äì3 in the Oslo, they won 8‚Äì6 on aggregate. The second round saw R.S.C. Anderlecht hammer Derry 9‚Äì0 in Belgium, however. The second leg of the tie was never played as the Irish Football Association banned the use of Derry's home-ground, the Brandywell, for the tie, with the fixture being announced as a walk-over. Between then and now the likes of Vitesse Arnhem and former European Cup winners, Benfica, have visited the Brandywell to play competitive European football. Following the League title win in the 1996‚Äì97 season, Derry represented the league in the UEFA Champions League. However, in the First Qualifying Round, they were knocked out by NK Maribor of Slovenia. The club's only win on the European stage previous to this, of course, had been in the 1965‚Äì66 season when they defeated F.C. Lyn Oslo by an 8‚Äì6 aggregate scoreline in the European Cup. After the NK Maribor experience, it would take 7 more years until Derry would again compete in European football. However, this time in the 2002‚Äì03 season, it would be in the UEFA Cup following their FAI Cup victory in 2002. The club failed to progress once more, knocked out by Cypriot side APOEL on this occasion by an aggregate score of 5‚Äì1 after hoping they had kept the tie alive with just a 2‚Äì1 defeat in the first leg away in Cyprus.\\"Derry City keep tie alive\\", BBC Sport Online, 14 August 2003. Derry once again qualified for the UEFA Cup for the 2006‚Äì07 season after finishing runners-up in the Premier Division in the 2005 season. On 13 July 2006, Derry overcame two-time winners IFK G√∂teborg in the UEFA Cup First Qualifying Round by an aggregate score of 2‚Äì0. A 79th-minute header from Sean Hargan was enough to give Derry a shock win\\"IFK Gothenburg 0‚Äì1 Derry City\\", BBC Sport Online, 13 July 2006. in the first leg, and Stephen O'Flynn ensured a 1‚Äì0 home victory from the penalty spot. Manager Stephen Kenny was delighted with the win stating: The league's low cooefficient ranking of 35th had led to arrogant under-estimation of the club's standard and before the win, IFK G√∂teborg's Niclas Alexandersson had rather misguidedly suggested that his team could take a holiday and still walk over the League of Ireland side. This marked Derry City's first progression in European football since defeating Lyn Oslo more than 40 years previously. Derry City were subsequently drawn against Scottish second-level side Gretna in the Second Qualifying Round. On 10 August 2006, Derry claimed a 5‚Äì1 away win to gain a considerable advantage going into the home leg. This result is the largest away winning margin for a League of Ireland team in Europe.\\"Slack Gretna given cruel lesson by five-star Derry\\", Stephen Halliday, The Scotsman, 11 August 2006. Following a 2‚Äì2 home draw with Gretna in the second leg and a 7‚Äì3 win on aggregate, Derry advanced to the UEFA Cup First Round. In the draw, held on 25 August 2006, Derry City were handed a tough tie against Paris Saint-Germain FC. The first leg, broadcast live on Eurosport, was played at home at Brandywell Stadium on the evening of 14 September and ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw. The second leg was played at Parc des Princes on 28 September after the club were given the honour of a civic reception in Paris by the Irish ambassador to France, Anne Anderson.\\"Irish Ambassador invite for Derry\\", BBC Sport Online, 24 September 2006. Paris St. Germain won the second leg 2‚Äì0 with first-half goals deriving from sloppy set-piece defending in the first-half. √âdouard Ciss√© and Pauleta were the goal-scorers. Thus, 2‚Äì0 was the overall aggregate score of the tie.\\"PSG 2‚Äì0 Derry City (agg: 2‚Äì0)\\", Lyle Jackson, BBC Sport Online, 28 September 2006. By finishing second in the eircom League Premier Division in 2006, Derry, once again, secured the return of UEFA Cup football to the Brandywell for the 2007‚Äì08 European season. Having later gone on to win the 2006 FAI Cup, which also rewarded the winner with a UEFA Cup spot, this win and qualification-route took prominence over the league qualification, and Derry's UEFA Cup qualification on account of their final league position was transferred to the next best-placed team below them ‚Äì that was Drogheda United who took third spot. On 8 January 2007, however, it was reported that Derry, as league runners-up in 2006, may qualify for the 2007‚Äì08 Champions League First Qualifying Round instead in the place of Shelbourne as the league-winners' place was placed under threat by financial problems which could have prevented the club from being awarded the required UEFA licence to compete.\\"Shelbourne's Euro place in danger\\", BBC Sport Online, 8 January 2007. Indeed, Shelbourne's board effectively jumped before being pushed and eventually opted out of competing, fearing that any team they fielded would damage the UEFA coefficient of the eircom League as the club had had to release their whole first-team prior to the 2007 season and build a new team with mainly youth players. This gave Derry the opportunity to take part in the Champions League.\\"Shels opt out of Champions League\\", The Irish Times, 30 March 2007. Derry City were awarded a UEFA licence on 17 April 2007 by the FAI's First Instance Committee, officially permitting them to represent the eircom League in the UEFA Champions League for the 2007‚Äì08 European season.\\"UEFA licences for five Irish clubs\\", RT√â.ie, 17 April 2007.

When he was barely five, his family returned to Sweden as a result of the French Revolution of 1848. His father was the Consul General, Adolf Eug√®ne von Rosen (1797-1886) who worked for public and state authorities with Swedish railway construction. From 1855 to 1861, he studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. After graduating, he visited London to see the 1862 International Exhibition, where he was influenced by the paintings on Medieval and Renaissance subjects created by Hendrik Leys. He later remarked that when he left London he was \\"300 years older\\". The following year, he spent some time at Leys' studio in Antwerp. Inspired by that experience, upon returning home he painted an historical scene of Sten Sture the Elder entering Stockholm. Despite its obvious debt to Leys, it was praised by King Oscar II and given a \\"Royal Medal\\". Shortly after, he set out on a tour of the Mediterranean; visiting Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Greece and returning through Hungary. In 1866 he visited Rome, then went to Antwerp, where he lived with Leys until his death in 1869. This was followed by studies with artist Karl von Piloty in Munich. Following his return to Sweden, in 1872 he became a member of the Swedish Royal Academy. He was promoted to Vice-Professor in 1874 and became a full Professor in 1880; retaining that position until 1908. He also served two terms as the Academy's Director; 1881-1887 and 1893-1899. During his first term, he came into conflict with a group of dissident students known as the (Opponenterna). From 1892 to 1900, he was Chairman of the animal rights organization (Djurens R√§tt) which was opposed to experimentation on animals. He was the recipient of numerous honors, including the Order of the Polar Star (1891) and the Order of Vasa (1897). In 1915, he received several honors associated with the war effort: the Order of Isabella the Catholic, the Order of the Medjidie, the Order of the Dannebrog, the Order of Leopold and the French Legion of Honor.

All the students are required to join one club of their interest and choice. Students can join two or more clubs but there has always been problems and conflicts about this matter regarding competency to multi-task in the clubs and organizations these students have joined. A scheme for grading honors students of the third and fourth year levels has been continuously used as a way to determine the awardees for graduation. The total grade of honors students is composed of 70% on academics while 30% on co-curricular. For those who are not vying for honors, they get an equivalent letter rating from the club with which they are in. This grade is shown in their report cards. This is also done for the honor students but the scheme mentioned is being used. There are 31 recognized clubs and organizations in the High School. * Student Council * Speech Club * Association of Students for Academic Competition * Math Club * Natural Science Club * Young Scientists' Club * English Forum * Samahang Kulturang Filipino * Social Studies Circle * Young Community Stewards * Liturgical Ministry * Dominican Network * Student Catholic Action * UST CAT Golden Corps of Cadets ** UST CAT Cadet Officers ** Honorary Corps of Sponsors and Escorts * Arts and Crafts Club (formerly TASC) * Culinary Arts Club * Music Society ** Glee Club ** Music Ensemble * Golden Scouts ** Boy Scouts of the Philippines ** Girl Scouts of the Philippines * Cultural Dance Troupe * Pep Squad * Athletics Club * Digital Arts Club * Information and Communications Technology Club * Drama Guild * The Aquinian (Official Student Publication) * Readers' Club * Dialektikos (Varsity Debate Team) * Peer Facilitators Club * Young Entrepreneurs Club These clubs and organizations have officers from the third and fourth year levels appointed before the summer of the incoming school year. Students may join during the Club Exposition. The members of each club shall attend the monthly Club Day of their chosen club. View from the Quadricentennial Park  Parents' Association  The Parents' Association is composed of all the parents of the students of the high school headed by a group of officers and class representatives chosen by fellow parents. The association has been very active in promoting a good teacher-parent relationship through its various activities and contests. Most of which are held during selected Sundays of each quarter. The association's main thrust is for the transparency of the school regarding matters affecting the students.  Alumni Association  The Alumni Association is headed by a set of officers with the main thrust of going over through matters concerning the alumni of the school. The Alumni Association has been a laudable stakeholder of the school for their contributions for the school at present.

The ghetto was liquidated in stages between 1942 and 1943 as part of the \\"Final Solution\\", with all Jews either killed on the spot in mass shooting actions or deported to Treblinka and Majdanek death camps. Ghetto history At the end of September 1939, during the Soviet invasion of Poland, the Red Army occupied the city of Miƒôdzyrzec Podlaski. At the beginning of October, the Soviet Union handed over the city to Germany as part of the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty amended to the secret Hitler-Stalin Pact against Poland in 1939. Following the exchange, approximately 2,000 of the city‚Äôs Jews left for the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The Germans set up a transfer ghetto in the historic neighbourhood of Szmulowizna. It held 20,000 Jewish prisoners at its peak. On August 25‚Äì26, 1942 some 11,000‚Äì12,000 Jews were rounded up by German Order Police battalions amid gunfire and screams and deported to the Treblinka extermination camp. The next mass extermination action took place around October and November 1942. \\"Strip-search\\" of young Jewish women was introduced by Oberleutnant Hartwig Gnade before executions dubbed \\"mopping up\\" actions. His first sergeant later said: \\"I must say that First Lieutenant Gnade gave me the impression that the entire business afforded him a great deal of pleasure.\\"Browning 1998, pp. 106-108. The wave of mass killings lasting non- stop for several days were conducted by the Trawniki battalion of about 350 to 400 men, while the Germans from the parallel Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the Ordnungspolizei from Hamburg dealt with the thousands of ghetto inhabitants. On the seventeenth of July 1943, the ghetto was liquidated, with all remaining Jews deported to Treblinka and Majdanek extermination camps; at which time the last 160-200 residents were shot, and the city was officially declared free of Jews. Fewer than 1% of the Jewish population of the city survived the German occupation.  Escape and rescue  Some Jews were able to escape from ghetto, and were offered aid by local Polish inhabitants. Jewish townsman, Sender Dyszel who managed to escape shootings in Miƒôdzyrzec was rescued by Polish Righteous Franciszka Abramowicz (1899‚Äì1990). She brought him food into the forest until he could return to her later. Dyszel emigrated to Argentina after 1947.

He is noted for being one of the early dissidents of the Emperor's regime and for organizing the 1960 coup attempt with his younger brother Germame Neway. Mengistu and his brother were members of a well-established noble lineage called Moja, which had supplied the Ethiopian government a number of soldiers and governors for a century, but at the time of the 1960 coup had fallen out of favor. Ethiopian observers, noting that the Moja had a tradition for favoring reforms, later speculated that their coup could be explained in terms of Ethiopian lineage politics. Christopher Clapham rejects this interpretation, noting \\"this is at best an oversimplification, in that some Mojas remained loyal to the Emperor, while several non-Mojas were actively involved; and there has been no evidence that Mengestu and Germame took the lead because of their Moja ancestry.\\"Christopher Clapham, \\"The Ethiopian Coup d'Etat of December 1960\\", Journal of Modern African Studies, 6 (1968), pp. 498 - 500.  Early life  Mengistu received his earliest education at the St. George school in Addis Ababa, a Swiss-run school which accepted its first students in September 1929.Bahru Zewde, Pioneers of Change in Ethiopia (Oxford: James Currey, 2002), p. 27 He then became a cadet in the first class of the Oletta Military Academy, which opened January 1935; this first class of cadets could not complete their education due to the advent of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War.Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia, second edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2001), p. 211 With his classmates, under the leadership of the Swedish Captain Viking Tamm, headmaster of Olette, they attempted to hold the Pass of Ad Termaber against the advancing Italians after the decisive Battle of Maychew (31 March 1936), but were forced to retreat to Addis Ababa.Anthony Mockler, Haile Selassie's War (New York: Olive Branch, 2003), pp. 124-132 The Oletta cadets then split up into two groups: one joined Ras Imru Haile Selassie at Gore; the other, which included Mengistu, had joined Aberra Kassa and took part in the Battle of Addis Ababa, where a bold attempt to recapture the capital failed. When Aberra appeared ready to submit to the Italians, the 20 or 30 surviving cadets left him to join the Arbegnoch led by Haile Mariam Mammo in Mulu.Mockler, Haile Selassie's War, pp. 169f After Haile Mariam had been killed fighting the Italians at Gorfo, near Addis Ababa (November 1938), he made his way to Khartoum where he trained with his fellow cadets Asrate Medhin Kassa, Mared Mangesha, Aman Andom and Mulugeta Bulli.Mockler, Haile Selassie's War, p. 403 After Emperor Haile Selassie returned to Ethiopia, Mengistu became a colonel in the Ethiopian army, and in April 1956 he was made commander of the Imperial Bodyguard, replacing General Mulugeta Bulli. Considering his later role in the attempted 1960 coup, a number of writers have pointed out the irony that he served as executioner of at least one group of the participants in the 1943 Gojjame rebellion led by former Arbegnoch Belay Zelleke,John Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984),p. 130n and was entrusted with apprehending the conspirators in the 1951 attempt to assassinate Emperor Haile Selassie which was led by another former Arbegnoch Nagash Bazabeh.Bahru Zewde, A History, p. 210  1960 coup  With the support of the Police Commissioner Brigadier General Tsege Dibu and the Chief of Security Colonel Warqenah Gabayahu, on the evening of 13 December 1960, the plotters managed to take hostage several ministers and other important figures present at Genetta Leul palace in Addis Ababa while the Emperor was out of the country. The next day, units of the Imperial Bodyguard surrounded the principal military bases in the capital and took control of the radio station. The Emperor was proclaimed deposed and his son Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen was appointed in his place. However, the rest of the military and the Ethiopian Church rallied to support the Emperor, and by 19 December the coup was crushed, although 15 of the 21 notables taken hostage were killed, including Mulugeta Buli.Edmund J. Keller, Revolutionary Ethiopia (Bloomington: Indiana University, 1988), pp. 132ff The hostages were machine gunned in the Green Salon just before the coup leaders retreated from the Palace compound. Among the important personages executed by the Mengistu's forces were Ras Abebe Aregai, the leading anti-fascist resistance leader against the Italian occupation; Ras Seyoum Mangasha Prince of Tigray, Abba Hanna Jimma, the Emperor's confessor, almoner, and administrator of his personal household; Dejazmatch Letyibelu, a prominent resistance leader during the Italian occupation and nobleman with close ties to the Emperor; and several others. General Tsege was killed in the fighting; Colonel Warqenah committed suicide.Clapham, \\"Ethiopian Coup\\", p. 497 Mengistu and Germame evaded capture until 24 December 1960 when they were surrounded by the army near Mojo. Rather than face capture, Germame committed suicide; Mengistu surrendered. He was put on trial which cause a sensation as he appeared in open court completely unrepentant. Accused of slaughtering the Emperor's loyal servants, General Mengistu is said to have replied \\"I did not kill His Majesty's friends, I only wiped the dirt from his eyes\\". It is said the Emperor was inclined to commute his death sentence to life in prison, but the powerful families of the victims of the Green Salon massacre were outraged at the idea, and the Emperor allowed the death penalty to be carried out. General Mengistu was hanged a few months later, on 30 March 1961. His second wife and widow, Woizero (Lady) Kefey Taffere, died in April 1999 having subsequently remarried. Woizero Kefey was a descendant of the old Zagwe Dynasty and a member of the upper levels of the Ethiopian aristocracy. He is survived by his two sons, Neway Mengistu and Germame Mengistu.

Their names were: Cairell Colla Uais; Muiredach Colla Fo Chr√≠ (also spelt Colla D√° Crich, or Fochrich); and √Åed Colla Menn. Colla Uais ruled as High King of Ireland for four years. Recent DNA analysis confirms the history of the Three Collas in fourth-century Ireland, but questions their descent from Eochaid Doiml√©n and Cairbre Lifechair. Legend According to tradition, the Three Collas killed their uncle, F√≠acha Sroiptine, at the Battle of Dubhchomar, in Crioch Rois, Breagh, with Colla Uais taking the kingship. It was prophesied that whoever killed them, his descendants would never rule Ireland. Colla Uais ruled in F√≠acha's place for three years (323-326 AD), and as High-King of Ireland for four years, until Fiacha's son Muiredach Tirech banished the Three Collas, exiling them and three hundred followers to Alba (Scotland). The mother of Three Collas was said to be Ailech, the daughter of Udhaire, king of Alba. According to Keating's version Udhaire put them in command of three hundred warriors. After that they returned to Ireland, hoping that Muiredach might kill them, and deprive his descendants of the throne. But Muiredach knew of the prophecy, and despite knowing they had killed his father, took them into his service. After several years, Muiredach decided the Collas should have territory of their own, and sent them to conquer Ulster. With an army drawn from Connacht, they fought seven battles in a week against the Ulaid at Achaidh Leithdeircc, killing Fergus Foga, king of Ulster, in the seventh. Colla Menn also died in this battle. They burned Emain Macha, the Ulster capital, after which it was abandoned, and seized substantial territories in mid-Ulster, thought to be the origin of the kingdom of Airg√≠alla. The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar √âirinn dates Colla Uais' High Kingship to 306‚Äì310. The Annals of the Four Masters dates his High Kingship to 322‚Äì326, and his destruction of Emain Macha and conquest of Ulster to 331.R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 343Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar √âirinn 1.47Annals of the Four Masters M322-331 However, the chronology of early Irish historical tradition is known to be artificial. One story makes Fiachra Cass√°n of the Airg√≠alla, son of Colla Fo Chr√≠, the foster-father of Cormac mac Airt, who according to the usual chronology was his own great great grandfather, and an alternative tradition dated the fall of Emain Macha to 450. The sixth century female saint, Derchairthinn, associated with Oughter Ard near Straffan, County Kildare, was said to be \\"of the race of Colla Uais, Monarch of √ârinn\\".The martyrology of Donegal; a calendar of the saints of Ireland (M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh, 1575-1643; 1861 edition editors John O'Donovan 1809-1861; James Henthorn Todd 1805-1869; William Reeves 1815-1892;1864) p71The Martyrology of √ìengus mac √ìengobann the Culdee Historical interpretation According to a theory advanced by T. F. O'Rahilly, the traditional story of the Three Collas is not historical, although it has a basis in history. O'Rahilly argues that the breaking of the power of the Ulaid, the destruction of Emain Macha and the establishment of the kingdoms of the Airgialla were actually accomplished by the three sons of Niall No√≠giallach, Conall, Endae and E√≥gan, who established the kingdoms of Tir E√≥gan and Tir Conaill in north-western Ulster in the mid-5th century. He believes the Three Collas are literary doublets of the three sons of Niall, their story a genealogical fiction intended to give the tributary kingdoms of the Airgialla a noble pedigree.T. F. O'Rahilly, Early Irish History and Mythology, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1946, pp. 224-232 This theory is followed by more recent historians, including Francis J. Byrne,Francis J. Byrne, Irish Kings and High Kings, Four Courts Press, 2001, pp. 66-73 and D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n.D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, \\"Ireland, 400-800\\", in D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n (ed.), A New History of Ireland I: Prehistoric and Early Ireland, Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. 202-203 Donald Schlegel claims the brothers' tripartite names to be the only examples in ancient Ireland of brothers using the Roman style naming convention of personal name followed by family name followed by an epithet. This may reflect their alleged \\"return\\" from exile in Alba, which at the traditional time of their story‚Äîthe 4th- century‚Äîwas part of the Roman Empire. Schlegel suggests that being put in command of 300 soldiers may have meant that were centurions in the Roman army. Schlegel also argues that the Three Collas, along with their name \\"Colla\\", may have descended from the Trinovantes of Britain. He claims that Trinovantes mistranslated by Ollams into Irish could have produced the name Airg√≠alla, the name given to the territory the Three Collas conquered in Ulster. In regards to Colla, it may derive from the names Coill or Coel, both of which Geoffrey Keating mentioned in the area the Trinovantes lived, Camulodunum (modern-day Colchester). Family treeDNA analysis In 2007, Josiah McGuire discovered that male DNA testers with surnames historically associated with the Three Collas in ancient pedigrees had the same Y-chromosome DNA. This DNA is passed down from father to son like surnames. Included among the surnames were McDonald and McMahon. Four McDonald testers have traced their ancestry back to an ancient McDonald pedigree that goes back to Colla Uais. Two McMahon testers have traced their an ancestry McMahon pedigree that goes back to Colla Crioch. In 2009, a public project was started at Family Tree DNA for testers who have Colla DNA. The testers with Colla DNA belong to a haplogroup named R-Z3000. This differs from the R-M222 haplogroup of testers with surnames descended from the U√≠ N√©ill and the Connachta. The historical interpretation by Donald Schlegel is consistent with recent DNA analysis. References Schlegel, Donald M. (2002); Reweaving the Tapestry of Ancient Ulster, pp. 729-731. Clogher Record.

History  As is the case with many American symphony orchestras, the Oklahoma City Philharmonic owes a degree of its heritage to two predecessor professional symphonic orchestras in the city, the first having been launched in 1924 as the Oklahoma City Symphony Orchestra. As a marker in history, the orchestra finished the 1928‚Äì1929 season, its fifth consecutive season, having performed 7 concerts during the winter to audiences of 2,000 in the Shrine Auditorium that had been erected in 1923.The Realm of Music, San Diego Union, July 28, 1929, pg. 39, col. 1 (bottom) The Second Oklahoma Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1938 with Ralph Asher Rose, Jr. (1911‚Äì1984) conducting the inaugural season. Rose was an Oklahoma City-born virtuoso violinist. He grew up in Bayside, New York, studied with Michael Press, and at Curtis beginning at age 12, then at Juilliard. He then worked as a violinist in Dallas.Flushing Friends to Greet 17-Year-Old Prodigy, The Brooklyn Daily Star, Queensboro Edition, December 17, 1928, pg. 9 During the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, under conductors Victor Alessandro and Guy Fraser Harrison (1894‚Äì1986),Harrison, Guy Fraser (1894-1986) , biography compiled by Sion M. Honea, Oklahoma Historical Society (2007) the Oklahoma Symphony attained national and international rank on several levels, helped by a regular series of radio broadcasts on the Mutual Broadcasting System and the Voice of America for American troops abroad. Conductor Ainslee Cox led the orchestra from 1974-1978. In 1988, when the Oklahoma Symphony Orchestra was disbanded, Joel Alan Levine spearheaded the founding of the Oklahoma City Philharmonic with the help of individuals, corporations, and philanthropic institutions ‚Äî culturally-minded civic leaders, the newly incorporated Oklahoma City Orchestra League, Inc., and grants from five major Oklahoma corporations (Oklahoma Gas & Electric, Oklahoma Publishing Company, Southwestern Bell, Kerr McGee, and First Interstate Bank).Southwestern Bell later became reaffiliated with its earlier parent, AT&T; First Interstate Bank was acquired by Wells Fargo. Adding Levine's nine consecutive seasons as associate conductor of the Oklahoma City Symphony (from 1979 to 1987), and his -year tenure as music director and conductor of the Oklahoma City Philharmonic, he led the orchestra for consecutive seasons, the longest of anyone in the City's history. In the 2017-2018 season, Alexander Mickelthwate joined the orchestra as \\"music director designate\\" while he finished his term as music director of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra. He became music director for the 2018 season, and in November Levine became \\"Music Director Emeritus\\", while continuing to work as the orchestra's archivist and historian. In September 2001, the OKC Philharmonic opened its season in the newly renovated Civic Center Music Hall. The renovation was one of several Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS) and cost $52.2 million, resulting in a complete transformation of the performance chamber into the Thelma Gaylord Performing Arts Theater. In addition to a complete interior renovation, the new music hall included a multistory atrium, improved acoustics and a hydraulic orchestra pit. The Philharmonic is the largest professional performing-arts organization in the state, in terms of budget and performers employed.

Background  A report by Pien Metaal and others written for the Transnational Institute (\\"Coca yes, cocaine no?\\", p. 19) states that:  Contemporary development of an ancient tradition  Foreign visitors to some Latin American countries have demonstrated an interest in commercial and cultural uses of the stimulant properties of the coca plant, which are less harmful than cocaine which is highly and unnaturally refined. A few websites depict a mild modern preparation of the powdery ypadu mixture using plastic jars and coffee grinders or food processors rather than the traditional implements such as clay vessels and mortar-and-pestles fashioned from wood. Peruvian coca of the species Erythroxylum coca has reportedly been used in this adaptation to produce effective mixtures with pleasant taste.  Support for the use of Ypadu  Proponents of coca recommend mass production of ypadu as a harmless replacement for heavily refined and concentrated cocaine. They argue that a mild alternative to cocaine would cut into the illicit drug trade and the costs it imposes on societies.

New Italian coach Carlo Recalcati let him return to the team, and although he lost the calling for the EuroBasket 2003, Pozzecco was part of the roster that won the silver medal at the Olympic Games in 2004. The following year he was part of the Italian squad at the EuroBasket 2005. Player profile Standing at , he played at the point guard position. He had great technical skills, court-vision, and shooting ability. He was a player full of fantasy, but weak on defense. He was dubbed as an all-around offensive talent. He is famous for his eccentric character, and, although it has caused problems for him with coaches through the years, it made him one of the most valued players in Italy.

In particular, it involves a mild form of noncommutativity, namely supercommutativity. Unitary (‚Äì1)F operator Following is the essence of supersymmetry, which is encapsulated within the following minimal quantum group. We have the two dimensional Hopf algebra generated by (-1)F subject to :{(-1)^F}^2=1 with the counit :\\\\epsilon((-1)^F)=1 and the coproduct :\\\\Delta (-1)^F=(-1)^F \\\\otimes (-1)^F and the antipode :S(-1)^F=(-1)^F Thus far, there is nothing supersymmetric about this Hopf algebra at all; it is isomorphic to the Hopf algebra of the two element group \\\\mathbb{Z}_2. Supersymmetry comes in when introducing the nontrivial quasitriangular structure :\\\\mathcal{R}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[ 1 \\\\otimes 1 + (-1)^F \\\\otimes 1 + 1 \\\\otimes (-1)^F - (-1)^F \\\\otimes (-1)^F\\\\right] where +1 eigenstates of (-1)F are called bosons and -1 eigenstates are called fermions. This describes a fermionic braiding; don't pick up a phase factor when interchanging two bosons or a boson and a fermion, but multiply by -1 when interchanging two fermions. This provides the essence of the boson/fermion distinction. Fermionic operators The previous analysis only introduced the concept of fermions, and is not actual supersymmetry. The Hopf algebra is \\\\mathbb{Z}_2 graded and contains even and odd elements. Even elements commute with (-1)F; odd ones anticommute. The subalgebra not containing (-1)^F is supercommutative. Let's say we are dealing with a super Lie algebra with even generators x and odd generators y. Then, :\\\\Delta x = x \\\\otimes 1 + 1 \\\\otimes x :\\\\Delta y = y \\\\otimes 1 + (-1)^F \\\\otimes y This is compatible with \\\\mathcal{R}.

Taxonomy The Mary River turtle was first formally described in 1994. Elusor is a monotypic genus representing a very old lineage of turtles that has all but disappeared from the evolutionary history of Australia. Description Turtle Cloacal Respiration The Mary River turtle is one of Australia's largest turtles. Specimens in excess of 50 cm in carapace length have been recorded. Hatchlings have a straight carapace length of 2.0‚Äì3.5 cm. Adult Mary River turtles have an elongated, streamlined carapace that can be plain in colour or intricately patterned. Overall colour can vary from rusty red to brown and almost black. The plastron varies from cream to pale pink. The skin colouration is similar to that of the shell and often has salmon pink present on the tail and limbs. The iris can be pale blue. Mary River turtles use bimodal respiration, and so are capable of absorbing oxygen via the cloaca whilst underwater. However, they do regularly come to the surface to breathe air in the usual way. A unique feature of the male Mary River turtle is the tail, which can measure almost two-thirds of the carapace length. The tail has haemal arches, a feature lost in all other modern turtles. It is probably a derived feature, but its function is not understood. Another unique feature is the exceptionally long barbels under the mandible. Proportionately, the Mary River turtle has the smallest head and largest hind feet of all the species within the catchment, which contributes to its distinction of being the fastest swimmer. The turtle is occasionally informally referred to as the green haired turtle due to the fact that many specimens are covered with growing strands of algae which resemble hair. Ecology Little is known about the ecology and behaviour of the Mary River Turtle. It inhabits flowing and well-oxygenated sections of streams in the Mary River basin, using terrestrial nest sites. Turtles take an unusually long time to mature; it has been estimated that females take 25 years, and males, 30 years to become adults. Mature males may be aggressive towards other males, or turtles of other species. The species is apparently omnivorous, taking plant matter such as algae as well as bivalves and other small animal prey. Conservation In the 1960s and 1970s, the Mary River turtle was popular as a pet in Australia, with about 15,000 sent to shops every year during a 10-year period. They were originally known as the \\"penny turtle\\" or \\"pet shop turtle\\". This species is currently listed as endangered under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992, and under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The international conservation body IUCN lists it as endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is also listed on the Zoological Society of London's Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered list, part of the EDGE of Existence programme. It is Australia's second-most endangered freshwater turtle species, after the western swamp turtle (Pseudemydura umbrina) of Western Australia. Mary River turtles were listed amongst the world's top 25 most endangered turtle species by the Turtle Conservation Fund in 2003. Australia's first reptile-focused, nonprofit conservation organisation, the Australian Freshwater Turtle Conservation and Research Association, were the first to breed this species in captivity for release into the wild in 2007.

Haymond would represent Randolph County in the Virginia General Assembly session of 1836-7. His father had served as a private in the Berks County, Pennsylvania militia during the American Revolutionary War before moving across the Appalachians. Polsley had one elder brother, John Haymond Polsley (1793-1879) who survived to adulthood and moved to first Indiana then Iowa (and two of whose sons died fighting for the Union during the American Civil War). The Polsley family also included three elder sisters and two younger sisters who survived to marry--Elizabeth P. Polsley Newbrough (1795-1875), Rowena Polsley Graham (1798-1845), Maria Polsley Billings (1800-1829), Amanda Polsley Hughes (1810-1876) and Paulina Olive Polsley Hall (1813-1852). Daniel Polsley attended country schools as a child, completed preparatory studies and read law. Daniel Polsley married Eliza Villette Brown (1806-1879) on August 14, 1827 in Wellsburg. Her grandfather, Oliver Brown (1752-1846), had likewise fought in the American Revolution, but on the Massachusetts line before moving to the Virginia mountains. The couple had many children, but several died young. Those surviving to adulthood included John Jacob Polsley (1831-1866), Daniel Willey Polsley (1842-1888) and Edgar Athling Polsley (1847-1925) Some sources show the couple had 12 children. Career Admitted to the bar in 1827, Polsley began his legal career in Wellsburg, Virginia (now West Virginia), the county seat of Brooke County, Virginia and on the Ohio River near Steubenville, Ohio. Polsley also edited the Western Transcript from 1833 to 1845. He then moved westward (or downstream on the Ohio River) to Mason County, Virginia (now West Virginia) in 1845, where he farmed as well as practiced law.

He later that year became Lieutenant Governor of the Restored government of Virginia. Meanwhile, his sons John Jacob Polsley and Daniel Willey Polsley had volunteered to fight for the Union, J.J. Polsley was the lieutenant Colonel of the 7th West Virginia Cavalry, and his brother enlisted as a private but rose to the rank of lieutenant. About two weeks before West Virginia became a separate state, Daniel Polsley resigned his legislative position (on June 8, 1863), in order to succeed James H. Brown as judge of the seventh judicial circuit of West Virginia, a position he held from 1863 to 1866. In the latter year James W. Hoge succeeded Judge Polsley, who resigned after being elected to Congress.Robert H. Ferguson, History of Mason County, West Virginia (1961; COlonel Charles Lewis Chapter NSDAR Point Pleasant, West Virginia Typescript) p. 1540 In the 1866 elections, voters of West Virginia's 3rd congressional district elected Polsley as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives, and he served from 1867 to 1869. Afterwards, fellow Republican John Witcher succeeded to the Congressional seat for one term before being replaced by a Democrat, and Polsley resumed his legal practice in Point Pleasant. Death and legacy Polsley died on October 14, 1877. He was interred there in Lone Oak Cemetery in Mason County. Other family members are in what became Maple Grove Cemetery in Fairmont.

In 1984, the chemical manufacturing company W.R. Grace & Co. announced its intentions to enter the home improvement retail business, hiring Bernard R. Kossar and Frank Doczi to head the new chain. The first Home Quarters stores opened in February 1985 in Virginia Beach and Hampton, Virginia. Grace spun off HQ in 1986, and in October 1987 HQ was in the midst of doing an IPO when \\"Black Monday\\" [stock market crash] occurred. The SEC put a moratorium on any IPO until the stock market stabilized. In December 1987, Hechinger agreed to buy HQ for $66 million. The merger was completed in February 1988, with Frank Doczi left in charge of the Home Quarters division (Kossar moves on to found OW Office Warehouse, an office supply store that used a logo and branding similar to that of HQ.) Under Hechinger, HQ expanded to much of the United States as a viable competitor to Home Depot, Lowe's, and Builders Square. However, by 1995 its parent company Hechinger had been hit with financial trouble and began to scale back its operations, including moving HQ's headquarters from Virginia Beach to Hechinger's main office in Landover, Maryland. The Hechinger family sold the company to Los Angeles investors Leonard Green & Partners for $507 million in July 1997, and the management launched new, smaller concept stores called Better Spaces and Wye River Hardware & Home searching for a niche. In September, Hechinger/HQ was merged with San Antonio, Texas-based Builders Square, formerly owned by Kmart. After several rounds of store closings, Hechinger Co. and Home Quarters Warehouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 11, 1999, but the reorganization failed. That September, Hechinger's assets were liquidated, including its 117 remaining stores.

It is situated approximately north-east of Driffield town centre and lies just south of the A614 road. The village is served by Nafferton railway station on the Yorkshire Coast Line from Hull to Scarborough. According to the 2011 UK Census, Nafferton parish had a population of 2,433, an increase on the 2001 UK Census figure of 2,184. History Archaeological evidence for settlement in the area dates back to the mesolithic. Early hunter-gatherers established temporary camp sites throughout the area, subsisting from woodlands foraging, deer, boars, bears, and wild cattle. The nearby Yorkshire Wolds were later the site of substantial human activity during the neolithic and the area features burial mounds, with frequent finds of lithic technology. According to A Dictionary of British Place Names the name Nafferton probably derives from \\"Nattfari\\", an Old Norse person name, with \\"tun\\", the Old English word for a farmstead or enclosure. Nafferton is listed in the Domesday Book as \\"Nadfartone\\". At the time of the survey the settlement was in the Hundred of Torbar, and the East Riding of Yorkshire. There were 6¬Ω households, 13 villagers, 17¬Ω ploughlands, a meadow, and a mill. In 1066 Karli son of Karli held the Lordship, this transferred in 1086 to William of Percy, who also became Tenant-in-chief to King William I. A second Domesday entry for Nafferton shows Bark as a further 1066 Lord, whose land and authority was taken in entirety by William I.\\"Documents Online: Nafferton\\", Folios: 301r, 322v, 382r, Great Domesday Book; The National Archives. Retrieved 19 November 2011 Nafferton Methodist Church In 1823 Nafferton was a parish in the Wapentake of Dickering. The ecclesiastical parish was under the patronage of the Archbishop of York. A Methodist and an Independent chapel, and a small endowed school existed. Population at the time was 917. Occupations included sixteen farmers & yeomen, two blacksmiths, four bricklayers and one brick maker, two carpenters, six grocers, five shoemakers, three tailors, two drapers, an earthenware dealer, a gardener, a plumber & glazier, a horse dealer, a cabinet maker, a rope & twine and a linen manufacturer, a schoolmaster, and the landlords of The Bell, The Cross Keys, The King's Head, and The white Horse public houses. Residents included the parish curate and two gentlemen. A Hull to Scarborough coach was routed through Nafferton \\"during the bathing season\\". A carrier operated between the village and Driffield, and Bridlington, once a week. The oldest surviving building in the village is the church, parts of which date from the 13th century. The church dedicated to All Saints was designated a Grade I listed building in 1966 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. Its best-known vicar was the parson-naturalist Francis Orpen Morris (1810‚Äì1893), author of highly successful books on birds, butterflies and moths. The Mere, a large expanse of water fed by natural springs, was formerly a mill pond. Transport Nafferton Railway Station Nafferton has bus and train services. Nafferton railway station has regular train services to Bridlington, Beverley and Hull with several running through to Scarborough, Doncaster, Meadowhall and Sheffield. Nafferton also has buses to Beverley, Hull, Bridlington, Scarborough and York (EYMS 121, 45/46, 270).

Left to right: Sherlock Bones, Strenuous Teddy, Daniel Webster, Pie-Mouth and Little Japansky (at stern). The Kin-der-Kids and Wee Willie Winkie's World were early newspaper comics by painter Lyonel Feininger and published by the Chicago Sunday Tribune during 1906‚Äì07. Similar in form to Little Nemo and the later Sunday editions of Krazy Kat, most of Feininger's comics occupied a full-page and were rendered in color. The Kin-der-Kids were published in Tribune papers beginning April 29, 1906. Feininger's second feature, Wee Willie Winkie's World, was published concurrently with The Kin-der-Kids from August 19, 1906, until The Kin-der-Kids's cancellation on November 18, 1906. Wee Willie Winkie's World ended three months later, on February 17, 1907. The series' short existences have been attributed to several causes, including Feininger being unable to produce two strips of finely detailed artwork on a weekly schedule, and personal conflict between Feininger and his publishers.Lyonel Feininger at Con Markstein's 'Toonopedia. Archived from the original on April 16, 2015. Much like The New York Herald's Little Nemo, Tribune publishers envisioned The Kin-der-kids as a relatively sophisticated alternative to the comical, and at times violent, antics of Happy Hooligan and The Katzenjammer Kids, comic strips published in newspapers owned by Hearst and Pulitzer.Blackbeard, Bill \\"Wee Willie Winkie, Tall Uncle Feininger, and the Comic Strip Horrors of 1906: How Auntie Jim-Jam was No Antidote but Genius Triumphed\\". The Comic Strip Art of Lionel Feininger Kitchen Sink Press, Northampton, MA: 1994. p. 3‚Äì4. Characters and story The Kin-der-Kids featured an ongoing story about the three Kin-der brothers who, along with their dog and a mechanical boy, sailed in the family's antique bathtub to explore the world. The story implies that the Kin-ders sailed for a specific reason: early on they receive a note ‚Äì unseen to the reader ‚Äì from Mysterious Pete which contains instructions for their journey. These instructions and the purpose of their journey remain indeterminate for the life of the comic. The primary cast of The Kin-der-Kids were introduced to Tribune readers before the commencement of the comic strip's regular publication. On April 29, 1906, the Tribune published a special \\"All About the Tribune's New Comic Supplement\\" section. The cover featured a caricature of \\"Uncle\\" Feininger suspending the cast marionette-like on strings. The \\"New Comic Supplement\\" introduction also included a page of color portraits of the characters, and inside the supplement were prose biographies of the characters. The cast introduced in this publication are: * Daniel Webster: The bookish leader of the children, he is frequently preoccupied with his reading, appealing to them with \\"oh, don't disturb me,\\" when the other children alert him to happenings around them. Daniel's design is notably similar to that of Wee Willie Winkie. * Pie-Mouth: The second of the children, a boy with an enormous mouth and an equally enormous appetite. * Strenuous Teddy: The most physical of the Kin-der kids, frequently demonstrating feats of strength. * Little Japansky: A clockwork boy-like machine found in the sea by Uncle Kin-der. Described as a \\"water baby,\\" Japansky is mechanical device lost by a Japanese submarine, not a living child. * Sherlock Bones: Daniel Webster's dog, a blue dachshund who accompanies the children on their adventures. * Aunt Jim-Jam and Gussie: Portrayed as over-worrying and concerned for the Kin-ders' safety, Aunt Jim- Jam pursues the Kids in a hot-air balloon to ensure that they receive their doses of castor oil. She is accompanied by her son, Gussie, and their pet cat. Along the way they pick up another traveler, Mr. Buggins, who was not mentioned in the April 29th introduction. * Mysterious Pete and his hound: Mysterious Pete is a strange visitor wrapped in a large blue cloak and a big hat, with one eye peering out. Pete floats on a cloud, accompanied by his dog, to deliver messages to the rest of the cast, and occasionally to rescue them from trouble. He is described by other characters as some kind of ghost, prefers buckskin clothing, and has a western style revolver at the ready. Although he initially gives the children their instructions, it is also he who sets Aunt JimJam and company in pursuit of the children. * The Pillsbury Family: Mister Phileas P. Pillsbury, possibly a snake oil salesman, is the inventor of \\"The Pillsbury Universal Growing Pill,\\" which he seeks to travel the world marketing, along with five young daughters. The Pillsburys are introduced as major characters, however they only make one minor appearance in the course of the strip's life. * Uncle Kin-der: the Kids' good-natured uncle and \\"nominal\\" head of the Kin-der family. Uncle Kin-der is never seen again after the strip's introduction. Wee Willie Winkie's World Wee Willie Winkie in his first appearance, encountering an anthropomorphic house. Unlike The Kin-der-Kids, Wee Willie Winkie's World was not a continuing adventure. Each comic strip features the eponymous protagonist observing the surreal countryside around his grandfather's home. He interacts with the inanimate objects around him which have anthropomorphic qualities. Instead of speech balloon spaces, the comic strip uses captions that accompany the images. After publication When Wee Willie Winkie's World ceased publication in 1907, it proved to be the last comic strip Feininger would create, although he would later use similar designs for his wooden landscape sculptures (photographs of which were released in a 1965 book City at the Edge of the World.) Despite the strips' short lives, they are praised by later comics enthusiasts. The Kin-der-Kids's \\"full-fledged, frankly suspenseful week-to- week continuity\\", writes cartooning historian Bill Blackbeard, was a \\"real innovation for the time\\" when even Winsor McCay's Little Nemo had not yet developed into ongoing stories.Blackbeard, 4. The artwork is lauded as well, and has been called \\"exquisitely drawn\\" in Time. Art Spiegelman, editor of Raw and author of Maus, praises the Kin-der-Kids as Feininger's crowning achievement: In 1994, the entirety of Feininger's comics were collected in a single volume by Kitchen Sink Press: The Comic Strip Art of Lionel Feininger. In 1999, The Comics Journal included The Kin-der-Kids in its \\"Top 100 Comics list\\". In 2011 Sunday Press Books published the book: Forgotten Fantasy: Sunday Comis 1900-1915, ISBN , collecting the complete The Kin-der-Kids and the complete Wee Willie Winkie's World.

Education and career Mermin was born in 1935 in New Haven, Connecticut. He obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Harvard University in 1956, graduating summa cum laude. He remained at Harvard for his graduate studies, earning a PhD in physics in 1961. After holding postdoctoral positions at the University of Birmingham and the University of California, San Diego, he joined the Cornell University faculty in 1964. He became a Cornell professor emeritus in 2006. Early in his career, Mermin worked in statistical physics and condensed-matter physics, including the study of matter at low temperatures, the behavior of electron gases, the classification of quasicrystals, and quantum chemistry. His later research contributions included work in quantum information science and the foundations of quantum mechanics. Mermin was the first to note how the three- particle GHZ state demonstrates that no local hidden variable theory can explain quantum correlations, and together with Asher Peres, he introduced the \\"magic square\\" proof, another demonstration that attempting to \\"complete\\" quantum mechanics with hidden variables does not work. In collaboration with Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard, he made a significant early contribution to quantum cryptography. Starting in 2012, he has advocated the interpretation known as Quantum Bayesianism, or QBism. In 2003, the journal Foundations of Physics published a bibliography of Mermin's writing that included three books, 125 technical articles, 18 pedagogical articles, 21 general articles, 34 book reviews, and 24 \\"Reference Frame\\" articles from Physics Today. Mermin was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1969, and he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1991. Word and phrase coinages Inspired by Lewis Carroll's comic poem The Hunting of the Snark, Mermin introduced the term boojum into the vocabulary of condensed-matter physics. In his book It's About Time (2005), one of several expository pieces on special relativity, he suggests that the English foot (0.3048 meters) be slightly modified to approximately 29.98 cm. This adaptation of a physical unit is one of several ploys that Mermin uses to draw students into spacetime geometry. In the book, Mermin writes: :Henceforth, by 1 foot we shall mean the distance light travels in a nanosecond. A foot, if you will, is a light nanosecond (and a nanosecond, even more nicely, can be viewed as a light foot). ... If it offends you to redefine the foot ... then you may define 0.299792458 meters to be 1 phoot, and think \\"phoot\\" (conveniently evocative of the Greek œÜœâœÑŒøœÇ, \\"light\\") whenever you read \\"foot\\".It's About Time, page 22 Though it is often misattributed to Richard Feynman, Mermin coined the phrase \\"shut up and calculate!\\" to characterize the views of many physicists regarding the interpretation of quantum mechanics.

The AP¬Æ participation rate at Exeter High School is 36 percent. The student body makeup is 50 percent male and 50 percent female, and the total minority enrollment is 6 percent. Exeter High School is the only high school in the Exeter Region Coop School District. According to state test scores, 55% of students are at least proficient in math and 81% in reading. History=Origin Exeter High School The Exeter Area Public School was established in 1848 as a co-educational institution and became a school for boys twenty years later when Robinson Female Seminary was founded.Exeter Area High School, Alumni Directory: 1993 The school was originally located on Court Street until 1912 when it was moved to Linden Street and changed to Exeter High School. The new school opened September 9, 1912, and most of the town stores declared a half-holiday for the occasion. The school was nicknamed \\"Tuck High School\\", thanks mainly to a gift of $5,000 by philanthropist Edward Tuck. The \\"Pinnacle\\" yearbook was first produced in 1949 as a joint effort by Exeter High School and Robinson Female Seminary. On April 7, 1954, an affirmative vote of a $760,000 bond was passed to construct a new coed Exeter High School and elementary school; the school opened in September 1956. Today Exeter High School After years of a growing population and structural problems experienced in the old building, it was determined that a new building would be built. The new Exeter High School opened on the outskirts of town, at 1 Blue Hawk Drive, on New Hampshire Route 27 in September 2006. The original Tuck School/Exeter High School was renovated into the Seacoast School of Technology, and an annex building (formerly Exeter Area Junior High School) was razed to make way for a new YMCA facility.

During the seasons of 1997‚Äì1999 Exeter won 26 consecutive games, the longest winning streak in school history. Exeter has sent over 65 representatives to play in the New Hampshire-Vermont Shrine Maple Sugar Bowl. The Blue Hawks have nine members in the New Hampshire Chapter of the Joe Yukica Hall of Fame. Zack Dziama (class of 2003) and Tyler Grant (2013) have won the Gatorade Player of the Year for football in New Hampshire. Head Coach William Ball has won over 100 games with Exeter and has been inducted into the New Hampshire Coaches Hall of Fame. The Exeter High football team has played rival Winnacunnet in neighboring Hampton 76 times since 1924. Exeter leads the all-time series, 53‚Äì22‚Äì2. The two schools have played for three state championships in Division II, with Winnacunnet winning in 1983 and 2000, while Exeter won in 2003, one of Exeter's perfect seasons (others being 1964 and 1999). The teams have played each other every year since 1947. The last Exeter/Winnacunnet game played at the original Eustis Field in 2005 was a 26‚Äì0 victory for Exeter. Eustis Field was named after Richard J. Eustis, who served as the Blue Hawks' athletic director from 1958 to 1969, and had been captain of the 1931 New Hampshire Wildcats football team. The Blue Hawks' home games are held at William D. Ball Stadium at Eustis Field, a grass-turf stadium facility. In 2005, the Blue Hawks won the last game on the original Eustis Field, defeating Merrimack in the semifinals before falling to Bishop Guertin in the Division II championship game. Exeter was reclassified as a Division I football program for the 2010 season, replacing Manchester West, which moved down to Division II. On November 19, 2011, playing at the home of defending champion Pinkerton Academy of Derry, Exeter won its first Division I title, 23‚Äì13. =Swimming and diving= The school's girl's swimming and diving team has won the NH Division I state championship four times since 2016 (2016, 2018, 2019, 2020).

The farmland, once owned by Leland Stanford, grows prunes, walnuts, and grapes that the monks harvest from the orchards and vineyards to sustain the community. History and daily life The Abbey was established in 1955 when monks from the Abbey of Gethsemani sought to begin a foundation in California. The monks live an austere contemplative life of penance and prayer on behalf of the reparation of sins. Their order is called Cistercians of the Strict Observance. The setting is extremely quiet and the monastery is completely hidden behind a wall that separates the guest and extern quarters and the monastic enclosure. There is very little interaction between the monks and retreatants; however, guests are welcome to join the monks in the chapel to chant the Divine Office seven times per day, beginning with Vigil at 3:30 a.m. and ending with Compline at 7:35 p.m. California Governor Jerry Brown is known to visit the Abbey. In 2009 Brown visited at the monastery before announcing his candidacy for California Governor. Chapter house View from within the 800-year-old chapter house brought from Santa Maria de Ovila in Spain Currently, the community is in the process of reassembling what the monks call their \\"Sacred Stones,\\" the limestone blocks from the 800-year-old chapter house (meeting room) of the Cistercian monastery of Santa Maria de Ovila that once stood in Trillo, Guadalajara, Spain. William Randolph Hearst purchased and dismantled the chapter house of the old Spanish monastery in 1931 and had the stones shipped to California, intending to include them in Wyntoon, a grand home he was building in remote Northern California. Instead, Hearst gave the stones to the city of San Francisco as part of an arrangement to abate taxes that he owed. The stones sat in San Francisco's Golden Gate park until 1994 when they were given to the abbey. The chapter house is being reconstructed outside the cloister of the Abbey of New Clairvaux. In October 2008, the ancient chapter house's Gothic portal was completed. In 2009, construction on the interior of the chapter house began with Gothic columns rising to their capitals. Wine Entrance to wine tasting room Leland Stanford had a vineyard on the property as far back as 1881, and Stanford's winery building still stands on the grounds. In 2000, the New Clairvaux Vineyard was planted. The monastery began to sell its wine in 2005. Beer In 2010, Sierra Nevada Brewing Company partnered with the Abbey, with the monastery beginning production of Trappist- style beers in 2011. The Abbey has not yet been sanctioned by the International Trappist Association, and therefore will not be brewing official Trappist beer. Several dubbel, tripel, and quadrupel Abbey beers are produced under the Ovila label.

It is a modification of the standard Hebb's Rule (see Hebbian learning) that, through multiplicative normalization, solves all stability problems and generates an algorithm for principal components analysis. This is a computational form of an effect which is believed to happen in biological neurons. Theory Oja's rule requires a number of simplifications to derive, but in its final form it is demonstrably stable, unlike Hebb's rule. It is a single-neuron special case of the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm. However, Oja's rule can also be generalized in other ways to varying degrees of stability and success. Formula Consider a simplified model of a neuron y that returns a linear combination of its inputs using presynaptic weights : \\\\,y(\\\\mathbf{x}) ~ = ~ \\\\sum_{j=1}^m x_j w_j Oja's rule defines the change in presynaptic weights given the output response y of a neuron to its inputs to be :\\\\,\\\\Delta \\\\mathbf{w} ~ = ~ \\\\mathbf{w}_{n+1}-\\\\mathbf{w}_{n} ~ = ~ \\\\eta \\\\, y_{n} (\\\\mathbf{x}_{n} - y_{n}\\\\mathbf{w}_{n}), where is the learning rate which can also change with time. Note that the bold symbols are vectors and defines a discrete time iteration. The rule can also be made for continuous iterations as :\\\\,\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{w}}{d t} ~ = ~ \\\\eta \\\\, y(t) (\\\\mathbf{x}(t) - y(t)\\\\mathbf{w}(t)). Derivation The simplest learning rule known is Hebb's rule, which states in conceptual terms that neurons that fire together, wire together. In component form as a difference equation, it is written :\\\\,\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{w} ~ = ~ \\\\eta\\\\, y(\\\\mathbf{x}_n) \\\\mathbf{x}_{n}, or in scalar form with implicit -dependence, :\\\\,w_{i}(n+1) ~ = ~ w_{i} + \\\\eta\\\\, y(\\\\mathbf{x}) x_{i}, where is again the output, this time explicitly dependent on its input vector . Hebb's rule has synaptic weights approaching infinity with a positive learning rate. We can stop this by normalizing the weights so that each weight's magnitude is restricted between 0, corresponding to no weight, and 1, corresponding to being the only input neuron with any weight. We do this by normalizing the weight vector to be of length one: :\\\\,w_i (n+1) ~ = ~ \\\\frac{w_i + \\\\eta\\\\, y(\\\\mathbf{x}) x_i}{\\\\left(\\\\sum_{j=1}^m [w_j + \\\\eta\\\\, y(\\\\mathbf{x}) x_j]^p \\\\right)^{1/p}}. Note that in Oja's original paper, , corresponding to quadrature (root sum of squares), which is the familiar Cartesian normalization rule. However, any type of normalization, even linear, will give the same result without loss of generality. For a small learning rate  \\\\eta  \\\\ll 1 the equation can be expanded as a Power series in \\\\eta. :\\\\,w_i (n+1) ~ = ~ \\\\frac{w_i}{\\\\left( \\\\sum_j w_j^p \\\\right)^{1/p}} ~ + ~ \\\\eta \\\\left( \\\\frac{y x_i}{\\\\left(\\\\sum_j w_j^p \\\\right)^{1/p}} - \\\\frac{w_i \\\\sum_j y x_j w_j^{p-1}}{\\\\left(\\\\sum_j w_j^p \\\\right)^{(1 + 1/p)}} \\\\right) ~ + ~ O(\\\\eta^2). For small , our higher-order terms go to zero. We again make the specification of a linear neuron, that is, the output of the neuron is equal to the sum of the product of each input and its synaptic weight, or :\\\\,y(\\\\mathbf{x}) ~ = ~ \\\\sum_{j=1}^m x_j w_j . We also specify that our weights normalize to , which will be a necessary condition for stability, so :\\\\, \\\\mathbf{w}  ~ = ~ \\\\left( \\\\sum_{j=1}^m w_j^p \\\\right)^{1/p} ~ = ~ 1, which, when substituted into our expansion, gives Oja's rule, or :\\\\,w_i (n+1) ~ = ~ w_i + \\\\eta\\\\, y(x_i - w_i y). Stability and PCA In analyzing the convergence of a single neuron evolving by Oja's rule, one extracts the first principal component, or feature, of a data set. Furthermore, with extensions using the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm, one can create a multi-Oja neural network that can extract as many features as desired, allowing for principal components analysis. A principal component is extracted from a dataset through some associated vector , or , and we can restore our original dataset by taking :\\\\mathbf{x} ~ = ~ \\\\sum_j a_j \\\\mathbf{q}_j. In the case of a single neuron trained by Oja's rule, we find the weight vector converges to , or the first principal component, as time or number of iterations approaches infinity. We can also define, given a set of input vectors , that its correlation matrix has an associated eigenvector given by with eigenvalue . The variance of outputs of our Oja neuron then converges with time iterations to the principal eigenvalue, or :\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\sigma^2(n) ~ = ~ \\\\lambda_1. These results are derived using Lyapunov function analysis, and they show that Oja's neuron necessarily converges on strictly the first principal component if certain conditions are met in our original learning rule. Most importantly, our learning rate is allowed to vary with time, but only such that its sum is divergent but its power sum is convergent, that is :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\eta(n) = \\\\infty, ~~~ \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\eta(n)^p < \\\\infty, ~~~ p > 1. Our output activation function is also allowed to be nonlinear and nonstatic, but it must be continuously differentiable in both and and have derivatives bounded in time. Generalizations Recently, in the context of associative learning, it has been shown that the Hebbian rule, which is similar to Oja's rule, can be generalized using an Ising-like model:Jakub M. Tomczak, Associative learning using Ising-like model, in Advances in Systems Science, (eds.) Jerzy ≈öwiƒÖtek, Adam Grzech, Pawe≈Ç ≈öwiƒÖtek, Jakub M. Tomczak, Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing, Vol. 240, Springer-Verlag, 2014, pp. 295-304, PDF The main idea of the generalization is based on formulating energy function like in Ising model and then applying stochastic gradient descent algorithm to this energy function. The energy function and the update rule corresponding to following the derivative are given by: :E(\\\\mathbf{w}) = - h\\\\mathbf{w} - b \\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\top} \\\\mathbf{V} \\\\mathbf{w} - c \\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\top} \\\\mathbf{x} y , :\\\\mathbf{w}_{n+1} = \\\\mathbf{w}_{n} + \\\\eta ( h + b (\\\\mathbf{V} + \\\\mathbf{V}^{\\\\top}) \\\\mathbf{w}_{n} + c \\\\mathbf{x}_{n+1} y_{n+1} ), where: y \\\\in \\\\\\\\{-1,1\\\\\\\\}, b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} is the coupling among inputs, c > 0 is the correlation strength between the model and the output, h \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} corresponds to the presence of an external magnetic field, \\\\mathbf{V} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{D\\\\times D} determines the connections among inputs. Then, for h=0, b = 0, and c = 1 we get the Hebbian rule, and for h=0, b=-0.5, c = 1, and \\\\mathbf{V} = \\\\mathbf{I}, where \\\\mathbf{I} is an identity matrix, introduce weight decay. The formula then reduces to: :\\\\mathbf{w}_{n+1} = \\\\mathbf{w}_{n} + \\\\eta ( 2 b \\\\mathbf{w}_{n} + \\\\mathbf{x}_{n+1} y_{n+1} ), Applications Oja's rule was originally described in Oja's 1982 paper, but the principle of self-organization to which it is applied is first attributed to Alan Turing in 1952. PCA has also had a long history of use before Oja's rule formalized its use in network computation in 1989. The model can thus be applied to any problem of self-organizing mapping, in particular those in which feature extraction is of primary interest. Therefore, Oja's rule has an important place in image and speech processing. It is also useful as it expands easily to higher dimensions of processing, thus being able to integrate multiple outputs quickly. A canonical example is its use in binocular vision. Biology and Oja's subspace rule There is clear evidence for both long- term potentiation and long-term depression in biological neural networks, along with a normalization effect in both input weights and neuron outputs. However, while there is no direct experimental evidence yet of Oja's rule active in a biological neural network, a biophysical derivation of a generalization of the rule is possible. Such a derivation requires retrograde signalling from the postsynaptic neuron, which is biologically plausible (see neural backpropagation), and takes the form of :\\\\Delta w_{ij} ~ \\\\propto ~ \\\\langle x_i y_j \\\\rangle - \\\\epsilon \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\left(c_\\\\mathrm{pre} * \\\\sum_k w_{ik} y_k \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left(c_\\\\mathrm{post} * y_j \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\rangle, where as before is the synaptic weight between the th input and th output neurons, is the input, is the postsynaptic output, and we define to be a constant analogous the learning rate, and and are presynaptic and postsynaptic functions that model the weakening of signals over time. Note that the angle brackets denote the average and the ‚àó operator is a convolution. By taking the pre- and post-synaptic functions into frequency space and combining integration terms with the convolution, we find that this gives an arbitrary- dimensional generalization of Oja's rule known as Oja's Subspace, namely :\\\\Delta w ~ = ~ C x\\\\cdot w - w\\\\cdot C y.

Manufacture The Maya blue pigment is a composite of organic and inorganic constituents, primarily indigo dyes derived from the leaves of anil (Indigofera suffruticosa) plants combined with palygorskite, a natural clay which is not known to exist in abundant deposits in Mesoamerica.Arnold (2005); Haude (1997). Smaller trace amounts of other mineral additives have also been identified.Haude (1997); Reyes-Valerio (1993). Historical use Maya blue first appeared around 800, and it was still used in the 16th century in several Convents of Colonial Mexico, notably in the paintings of the Indian Juan Gerson in Tecamachalco. These paintings are a clear example of the combination of Indian and European techniques sometimes known as Arte Indocristiano. After that, the techniques for its production were lost in Mexico, but in Cuba there are examples from as late as 1830. They also painted unicorns with it.Chiari (2000) Resistance to weathering Despite the time and the harsh weathering conditions, paintings colored by Maya blue have not faded over time. The color has resisted chemical solvents and acids such as nitric acid. Its resistance against chemical aggression (acids, alkalis, solvents, etc.) and biodegradation was tested, and it was shown that Maya blue is an extremely resistant pigment, but it can be destroyed using very intense acid treatment under reflux.Sanchez del Rio(2006) Research on chemical composition Microscopic image of a mural at Bonampak Microscopic image of a mural at Teotihuacan Mexican Colonial Painting by Juan Gerson where Maya blue was used: The technique disappeared in the early colonial period. The chemical composition of the compound was determined by powder diffraction in the 1950s and was found to be a composite of palygorskite and indigo, most likely derived from the leaves of the a√±il. An actual recipe to reproduce Maya blue pigment was published in 1993 by a Mexican historian and chemist, Constantino Reyes-Valerio. The combination of different clays (palygorskite and montmorillonite), together with the use of the leaves of the a√±il and the actual process is described in his paper.Reyes-Valerio, De Bonampak al Templo Mayor, La historia del Azul Maya en Mesoamerica, Siglo XXI Editores, 1993. Reyes-Valerio's contributions were possibly due to his combined background of history and chemistry, through a thorough revision of primary texts (Sahagun, Hernandez, Jimenez, and others), microscopic analysis of the mural paintings and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. After the formula for the production was published in the book De Bonampak al Templo Mayor: Historia del Azul Maya en Mesoamerica, many developments in the chemical analysis of the pigment occurred in collaborations between Reyes-Valerio and European scientists.notably, Giaccomo Chiari from the University of Torino, David Aj√≤ from C.N.R. of Padua and Manuel Sanchez del Rio from ESRF in France A comprehensive study on the pigment which describes history, the experimental study techniques (diffraction studies, infrared spectroscopies, Raman amplification, optical spectroscopies, voltammetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and computer modelling), the syntheses, properties and nature of Maya blue and the research in relation with the archaeological and historical contexts has been published in the journal Developments in Clay Science. Uses in cultural contexts Pre-Columbian American culture * In the Americas, Maya blue was used as a colorant in pre-Columbian artworks, sculptures, murals, and textiles (probably), and to illuminate Mesoamerican codices. For example, many illustrations in the Florentine Codex written by Bernardino de Sahag√∫n contain the Maya blue color. * Maya blue may have been used in the Grolier Codex. Yet there's a dispute about this codex, and whether or not the use of Maya blue has been confirmed. * Recent research also suggests Maya blue may have played an important role in human sacrifices to Chaac at Chich√©n Itz√°, both produced at the sacrificial site and used to paint the bodies of the victims.Greg Borzo's press release, 26-Feb-2008 (update when the actual study comes out) * Maya blue is associated with the center of a flame.

At that time, there was no efforts made by the U.S. government for the education of Native Americans, and for nearly twenty years, he had to rely on private resources, mostly the Presbyterian mission office. By the time they ceased to provide aid, a national office of the Catholic Church dedicated to the assistance of Blacks and Native Americans had been established and was able to provide limited support.

In addition to those representing the large fraternal organizations who initiated the gathering, delegates in attendance represented the Organization for the Rebirth of Ukraine (ODWU), the Ukrainian National Women's League of America, the Association of Ukrainian Sich Riflemen, Ukrainian American Veterans, Ukrainian Catholic parishes and brotherhoods, Ukrainian Orthodox parishes and brotherhoods, the Association of Greek-Catholic Ruthenian Brotherhoods, political associations, various Ukrainian American Clubs, National Homes, political clubs, choir associations, dance and drama clubs, and others. Delegates travelled from the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and California. At the time of the first Congress, the Soviet Union was still months away from being expelled from the League of Nations for colluding with Hitler and invading Finland, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt had yet to order a massive modernization of the United States Navy. Pro-communist and Russophile propagandists actively sought to negate the claims of Ukrainian nationalists calling for support of an independent Ukraine. The physical gathering of delegates took place over the course of a single day, with speeches and appearances by US legislators taking precedence over formal elections. Speakers included then-House Majority Whip Representative Patrick J. Boland (D-PA), then-Dean of the United States House of Representatives Rep. Adolph J. Sabath (D-IL), Senator Joseph F. Guffey (D-PA), Sen. James J. Davis (R-PA), Sen. Francis T. Maloney (D-CT), Rep. J. Harold Flannery (D-PA), Rep. Lewis K. Rockefeller (R-NY), Rep. Jerry Voorhis (D-CA), Rep. Francis E. Walter (D-PA), and Rep. Caroline O'Day (D-NY), the first woman Democrat elected to Congress. Presentations were given on topics including \\"To What Extent Ukrainians Have Contributed to the Cultural And Material Development of America,\\" \\"The Economic Foundations of an Independent Ukraine,\\" \\"Our Assistance To Ukraine,\\" and others. The work of hundreds of organizers preceded the Washington gathering, and a widely published editorial was released to coincide with the meeting, entitled, \\"Ukrainians Prepare For Independence.\\" At the conclusion of the Congress, a gala concert was performed featuring a Ukrainian Chorus under the direction of renowned Ukrainian maestro Alexander Koshetz. Adorned in vyshyvanka and Ukrainian wreaths, the singers performed stirring renditions of the Ukrainian anthem Shche ne vmerla Ukraina and the Star-Spangled Banner. Artists such as the soprano Maria Hrebenetska added to the gala with performances of works by Mykola Lysenko and more contemporary works. In the year following this first congress, Nazi Germany would invade Ukraine, and Japan would attack Pearl Harbor. While the US had resisted involvement in the war during the first Ukrainian Congress, by January 1944, the Allied powers had already begun plans for major counteroffensives. II Congress left The \\"Second Congress of Americans of Ukrainian Descent\\" was held at the Hotel Benjamin Franklin, in Philadelphia, PA, on January 22‚Äì23, 1944. With Joseph Stalin now a wartime ally of the United States, following the Nazi invasion of Soviet-occupied Ukraine, Communists and Russophiles, encouraged by their Soviet leaders and agencies, sought to vilify American Ukrainians in America wherever they could. Anti-Ukrainian propaganda even extended to American press and broadcasts, including the radio editorials of Walter Winchell. Anti-Ukrainian books such as _Sabotage! The Secret War Against America_ (1942), by Albert E. Kahn and Michael Sayers accused Ukrainian immigrants of conspiring against the United States. This hostile atmosphere made planning for another national gathering difficult for Ukrainian-Americans, especially with wartime travel restrictions in place. Without any U.S. government officials attending, 235 delegates voted on an ambitious program of activity to support both the United States and Ukraine's continuing struggle for independence. The second Congress approved an American-Ukrainian war bond drive, the establishment of United Ukrainian American Relief Committee for Ukrainian war victims and refugees, and the publication of the only English-language scholarly journal on Ukraine for its time ‚Äì The Ukrainian Quarterly. III Congress At the close of the war, a delegation of Ukrainian-American representatives which had been elected at the second Congress in 1944, flew to San Francisco to advocate on behalf of a free Ukraine during the formation of the United Nations, convening at the Conference on International Organization in May 1945. Contrary to the hopes of the UCCA delegates, Soviet-occupied Ukraine was officially recognized as a member state of the United Nations in June 1945. In light of the developments at the United Nations, Ukrainian-Americans gathered again in Washington, DC, at the Almas Temple on May 31, 1946. At the \\"Third Congress of Americans of Ukrainian Descent,\\" a unified national platform was agreed upon, supporting a non-isolationist U.S. foreign policy, to confront an emergent \\"totalitarian- imperialistic U.S.S.R.\\" Furthermore, the ideals incorporated into the 1941 Atlantic Charter as delineated by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, were formally embraced by the delegates at the third Congress, as well as President Roosevelt's goals of Freedom of speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from fear; otherwise referred to as the \\"Four Freedoms.\\" As with the second Congress, there were no elected US officials in attendance at the third Congress, although Fred Zaplitny, a member of the Canadian House of Commons did attend and delivered greetings from his fellow Ukrainian Canadians. Following the third Congress, UCCA chairman Stephan Shumeyko flew to the Paris Peace Conference, delivering UCCA memorandums to delegations representing governments across the world. As the Western Allied countries would begin to wind down their sponsorship of Displaced Person (DP) zones in Europe, the UCCA would focus its attention on the million displaced persons in Europe, more than half of whom were in the U.S. Zone. The newly formed United Ukrainian American Relief Committee (founded at the second Congress) coordinated Ukrainian American efforts towards the enactment of the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, providing for more than 200,000 DPs to enter the US over the next two years, 85,000 of whom were Ukrainians. IV Congress Between 1938 and 1952, the United Ukrainian American Relief Committee assisted in the immigration of over 33,000 displaced Ukrainian refugees to the United States; sponsorship by additional charities more than doubled the number of new Ukrainian immigrants into the diaspora. Whereas earlier waves of Ukrainian immigration fled from poverty and arrived mostly illiterate, the political refugees driven out of their country by the recent war and persecution had on average a decade of education, while many were college graduates and professionals. These newer arrivals brought with them the organizational mindset which led to the flourishing of organizations such as the Ukrainian American Youth Association, the Federation of Ukrainian Student Organizations of America, the Organization of Democratic Ukrainian Youth, and the Shevchenko Scientific Society. In 1947, a Pan-American Ukrainian Conference was organized for the first time, uniting the organizing efforts of the UCCA, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, the Ukrainian Central Representation in Argentina and the Society of Friends of Ukrainian Culture in Brazil. Representatives of this new wave of immigrants participated at the gathering of the \\"Fourth Congress of Americans of Ukrainian Descent,\\" which took place from November 5‚Äì6, 1949, again at the Almas Temple in Washington, D.C. The newer immigrants presented reports on the state of displaced Ukrainians scattered throughout Europe, as well as read greetings from Ukrainian leaders in Eastern Ukraine, Western Ukraine, Carpathian Ukraine and other regions. Unlike the II and III Congresses, the IV Congress saw the return of US government officials paying attention to the organized Ukrainian diaspora, beginning with the first Presidential greeting sent to a Ukraine Congress, from newly re-elected President Harry S. Truman. Senator H. Alexander Smith told the 368 delegates, representing some 472 different organizations, that it was the great privilege and responsibility of the United States to lead and assist in Ukraine's efforts to \\"throw off the shackles of imperialism,\\" and hailed the \\"grim determination of courageous individuals to secure their freedom rather than yield to the tempting allurements of fascist-nazism or communist-marxism.\\"\\"Free World Call Made By Truman\\". The New York Times. November 6, 1949. Also addressing the delegates, was Under Secretary of State Herbert A. Fierst, as well as Edward J. Shaughnessy, director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, New York, who urged Ukrainians to share the truth about life outside the Iron Curtain with their friends and family who remained in Europe.\\"Ukrainians Urged to Toil For Liberty\\". The Washington Post. November 6, 1940. p. M6. V Congress The \\"Fifth Congress of Americans of Ukrainian Descent\\" was held on July 4‚Äì6, 1952, at the Hotel Statler in New York City. The first of many Congresses to take place in New York City, the event was the most well attended with nearly 1,500 delegates and guests in attendance, generating plenty of interest from the New York press. The Cold War with the Soviets had by then begun in earnest, ensnaring the United States military in another campaign ‚Äì the Korean War. The Mutual Security Act of 1951 launched a new era of American Foreign Aid, and more pressingly for an immigrant population, Congress had recently enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 over the veto of President Truman, which changed the quota systems that determined which ethnic groups were 'desirable immigrants.' Addressing the delegates, the Secretary of the Interior, Oscar L. Chapman, remarked, \\"The Ukrainian tradition is completely in harmony with the American tradition. A thousand years ago, before the existence of the North American continent was known, the great Kingdom of Kiev was the political and cultural creation of the Ukrainian people, the easternmost bastion of Western culture. Still later, the rising princes of Moscovy came to assert their mastery. The independence of Kiev vanished, and there began a long period of foreign rule, which unhappily exists to this day. But at the heart of the Ukrainian tradition lies the significant fact that although political independence was destroyed, the great desire for independence did not die.\\" Retired Admiral and recent U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Alan Goodrich Kirk, also spoke at the Congress. VI Congress The 6th \\"Congress of Americans of Ukrainian Descent\\" took place in the Hotel Commodore in New York City, from the May 28 to 30, 1955.

The music of the band, which features tambourines and handclaps, has garnered comparisons to 1960s pop bands such as The Beach Boys, The Zombies, The Kinks, modern-day pop group The Shins, and the Elephant Six collective.  History  Before Ed Reyes and Ian Moreno formed The Little Ones, they were members of an indie rock band called Sunday's Best. Reyes explained in an interview for the South by Southwest (SXSW) arts festival that \\"We‚Äôre always the underdogs. We‚Äôre not hired guns; we‚Äôre all friends and that keeps us dynamic. We‚Äôre always having fun!\\" The following is taken from the \\"Biography\\" section of The Little Ones Facebook fan page: > Our friend Moses tells us about The Little Ones‚Äô journey out of the land of > White Noise...The Little Ones finally left the land of White Noise and set > sail to bring good cheer to others everywhere.

The band was initially signed to Astralwerks Records and released one EP on that label, entitled Sing Song (EP). In 2006, Matt Costa invited the band to open for him at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City, US, and the band experienced a subsequent increase in popularity. Shortly after releasing a new single, \\"Ordinary Song\\", early in 2008, the Littles Ones lost its recording contract and were forced to postpone the release of its debut album. Instead, an EP, entitled Terry Tales & Fallen Gates, was released on Branches Recording Collective, a label created by the band. On July 28, 2008, The Little Ones released its debut full-length album, Morning Tide, on Heavenly Recordings, a United Kingdom (UK) record label‚Äîthis was preceded by the release of a single of the same name in the week previous. The Morning Tide album was met with less-than-favorable reviews, and received a 60% from Metacritic. The band released two singles as free downloads \\"Argonauts\\" and \\"Forro\\" on November 6, 2012 and January 21, 2013, respectively; the releases were promoted on both the band's website and Facebook fan page. \\"Argonauts\\" is the first single release from the band's second album The Dawn Sang Along and an album launch was held on February 8, 2013 at the Echo venue in Los Angeles, California, U.S. A music video for \\"Argonauts\\", directed by Lee LaDouceur and edited by Derek Lieu, was published on the Internet on February 1, 2013. The song appears in a 2013 Citibank advertisement for one of the corporation's apps.  Style  A review of the Little Ones' style was published in the UK's Guardian newspaper, with the journalist stating that \\"The Little Ones are capable of freakishly infectious guitar pop. Elsewhere, they sound like twee US indie kids doing karaoke versions of Magic Numbers tunes\\". Following the release of the band's second album, bassist Brian Reyes revealed, \\"We love pop, the way 60s songs were crafted: there‚Äôs a hook, vocal layerings, harmonies.\\" Touring The Little Ones supported popular British rock act, Kaiser Chiefs, on a UK arena tour, together with We Are Scientists, during late 2007. The band appeared at the SXSW arts festival, held annually in Austin, Texas, US, in both 2008 and 2013. Following the 2008 performance, the British music publication NME published an article entitled \\"The Little Ones encourage 'smoking the ganja' at SXSW\\" after it was reported that Ed Reyes has stated to the audience, \\"I smell ganja and we encourage that. Light them up.\\" In 2013, the band played two sets: A \\"Deli Radio Showcase\\" and a \\"SXSW Official Showcase\\". Recognition Seattle, Washington, US radio station, KEXP, a member of the NPR media organization, featured \\"Oh, MJ!\\" as its \\"song of the day\\" on November 28, 2006 and the band played the song live on KEXP prior to October 2007. Kevin Cole, writing for KEXP, then selected the Sing Song EP in a list of the eleven best debut albums of 2006. Cole described the band and the EP in the following manner: \\"This L.A. band makes its debut with a charming, sunny indie-pop EP, which combines pulsing rhythms with strong melodies in ways that recall Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, but with less of an obvious Talking Heads influence and a bit more Shins-style jangle.\\" In 2005, NPR's John Richards featured the song \\"Lovers Who Uncover\\" as its \\"song of the day\\", explaining that it \\"skillfully combines handclaps with fists-in-the-air chanting\\". Richards further stated, \\"If there's ever a textbook on writing foot-tapping, hand-clapping pop songs, these guys should write the introduction.\\" Media appearances *Live performance on KEXP on July 29, 2006, *Appeared as the \\"Super Music Friends Show Musical Guest\\" on the Nickelodeon children's show, Yo Gabba Gabba!

Founding member and first president, Mr. Yevhen Liakhovych, an engineer by training and a proponent of Ukrainian nation's right to self-determination and independence from the Soviet Union, established the ODFFU to support the struggle for a free and independent Ukraine. The Founding of ODFFU The ‚ÄòOrganization for the Defense of Four Freedoms for Ukraine, Inc.‚Äô was founded on October 27, 1946, at a conference of representatives from various Ukrainian American organizations in New York City. Under the leadership of Yevhen Liakhovych, the ODFFU was formed to support the struggle for a free and independent Ukraine. Throughout the years of its existence, ODFFU grew from a small group of dedicated individuals with one branch in Newark, New Jersey, to a large national organization with over 57 branches located in the most populated Ukrainian-American areas of the USA. In 1990, Ukraine declared its sovereignty and in 1991, Ukraine declared its independence. Ukraine was finally free, but not quite democratic. In 2004, with the ‚ÄúOrange Revolution‚Äù, Ukraine stepped onto the road to true democracy. And the ODFFU today continues its work to make sure the four freedoms are a part of this new Ukraine. Ideology of the ODFFU The name and the ideology of the ‚ÄòOrganization for the Defense of Four Freedoms for Ukraine‚Äô is based on President Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs ‚ÄòFour Freedoms‚Äô address before the United States Congress on January 25, 1941. This speech was the basis for the strategic partnership of the United States and Great Britain that was embodied in the declaration known as the ‚ÄòAtlantic Charter‚Äô. The four freedoms are: 1) Freedom of Speech 2) Freedom of Conscience 3) Freedom from Fear 4) Freedom from Want These freedoms are the basis for the health and development of modern civilized societies that must be preserved and adopted by all nations of the world. 1) Freedom of Speech- This idea represents not only the rights of individuals, but also the rights of a free nation to freely formulate its ideas and development. 2) Freedom of Conscience- This cannot exist while one is under any type of physical occupation. Freedom of Conscience only exists when one embodies a belief in God and freedom of religion. 3) Freedom from Fear- Individuals must have the right to freely develop their political, social, cultural and economic institutions, which they feel will benefit their nation. 4) Freedom from Want- This can only be achieved by having a government that provides opportunities for people to have access to the means of development and growth economically. The name is based upon President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Four Freedoms Address before the US Congress on January 25, 1941. This speech formed the basis of a strategic partnership between the United States and Great Britain that became embodied in a declaration known as the Atlantic Charter. Following an extensive remodelling at the National Archives, President Roosevelt's speech sits alongside America's founding documents like the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution. The ODFFU grew from a small group of dedicated individuals with one branch in the city of Newark, NJ in 1946, to a large national organization with over 57 branches located throughout the United States. In 1991, Ukraine declared its independence, sealing the fate of the Soviet Union and bringing about an end to the Cold War. In 2004, with the \\"Orange Revolution\\" Ukraine stepped onto the road to democracy. The ODFFU continues its work to ensure the four freedoms are part of Ukraine today.

She died on 20 August 1991 in St Albans City Hospital; of complicationsWolmar, Christian (19 Feb 1994). Suicide doctor faced seven complaints: Councillor in Westminster housing scandal also had professional worries The Independent following a stroke.  Early life  Esme was the only child of Ivy George, who named her Esm√© after a character in a book. Her father William Gwyn Thomas was an international rugby player. He emigrated to the US in 1923 but Esme's mother declined his invitation to follow later. Esme was brought up by her maternal grandparents Charles Henry George and Annie George (n√©e Langley) in Preston, Lancashire. She enjoyed cycling and swimming; a childhood hero was Johnny Weissmuller in the Tarzan films.  Education  At school Esm√© took an interest in languages, English in particular; she learned Latin, French and German and wanted to study Ancient Greek too but there were no classes available to her at the time. After passing her Matriculation (University entrance) in 1935 at the age of 16 her formal education ended. According to her semi-autobiographical novel, Esm√© was enjoying life in London with a friend's family and refused to return to school for her final year of English Honours. The son of the family proposed marriage but his mother did not approve so they broke up. At the age of 17 she was on her own, living and working in London, and through necessity living a frugal life. She volunteered to serve in the Army in 1939 and after the war, as a single mother, was unable to take up her university place. Later Esm√© studied Italian for fun, Swahili and Chichewa while working in Malawi, Spanish during her retirement in Spain and, just before her final illness at the age of 72, she was studying Russian.  World War II  Why Should I Be Dismayed? ‚Äì Written by Esme Langley under the 'Ann Bruce' pseudonym Esm√© served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) during World War II, teaching typing and shorthand. While grateful that her typing prowess kept her in work, she was irritated by employers who ignored her other skills.Sylvester Stein's blog where he writes: I had a formidable secretary once, Esme Langley-Ross, with a formidable IQ, who was so on top of the job that she would hector me as to the logic and the grammar of what she was taking down almost before I said it. For example, she regularly completed difficult crosswords like Ximenes and Azed, but when she applied to join the Bletchley Park team working on the German Enigma cipher, her military unit would not release her. After her release from the British Army in November 1945 (\\"Military Conduct: Exemplary\\") Esm√© was penniless, homeless and pregnant. Her book, Why should I be dismayed?,Why should I be dismayed (1958) ‚Äì Ann Bruce (aka Esme Langley) ‚Äì Faber and Faber ‚Äì NO ISBN Available about life as a single parent was recommended reading for social workers at the time.  BBC  Esm√© got a job with the BBC Monitoring unit at Caversham Park near Reading and spent several years exploring languages and playing squash and chess with the Russian monitors there. She had another two children, by a Yugoslav journalist, but never wanted to live with him. In 1956 she arranged a mortgage, bought a house in Bromley, Kent and took in lodgers. There she met an African called Tchum and they considered marriage; Esm√© decided against it on the grounds of likely prejudices against her existing and future children.  Arena Three  Esm√© was a strong supporter of minorities of all kinds, and not afraid to speak her mind. In 1963 after learning new skills working for Sylvester Stein on the London Property Letter, she founded her own magazine publishing enterprise, the Minorities Research Group, from her basement flat in Hampstead. On legal advice she was the sole proprietorTimeline 1966: Arena 3 The Lesbian Archive and Information Centre: Esme Langley was the powerhouse behind the Minority Research Group and accepted sole responsibility for publishing the magazine so that accusations of a \\"Lesbian Conspiracy\\" could not be made. so that she could not be charged with statutory conspiracy. She published Mainland (for the homeless) which flopped and then Arena Three (magazine) (for lesbians) which took over her life for many years.  Malawi  When Esm√© considered that Arena Three had accomplished most of its aims, she moved to Malawi in 1971 with an Austin Champ and took a two-year secretarial assignment in the Office of the President. While there she learned basic Chichewa and Swahili. She named her dog St Leonards as a derogatory but deniable reference to Hastings Banda and his repressive regime. After an outspoken friend of hers disappeared, Esm√© resigned her post a few months early and with her eldest son's fiance√© set off on a six-week tour of Southern Africa, smuggling a Jehovah's Witness to safety over the border on the way. Her Austin Champ broke down early in the journey but they continued on foot and hitchhiking through Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa before returning home to England.  Music and letters  After decades of smoking, Esm√© had chronic bronchitis and emphysema. For health reasons she moved in 1986 from Hertfordshire to Torrevieja, Spain, and pursued her hobbies of Mozart, writing and gardening for her remaining years.

The community is near Wheeling Township and its sister community of Blainesville. Maynard is a part of the St. Clairsville-Richland City School District. Name Origin Maynard was named for Postmaster General Horace Maynard, who would serve under President Rutherford B. Hayes when the community would apply for its post office in 1880. Interestingly, while serving as a Representative from Tennessee, Maynard had visited the county seat St. Clairsville stumping on behalf of President Andrew Johnson and his policies while on the Swing Around the Circle campaign nearly fifteen years before the Post Office's naming. Until its postal application, the rail stop was called Henderson's Station after the Henderson family. Undoubtedly, Maynard would have been named Henderson if the name had not already been in use. A short-lived mail stop on the St. Clairsville-Cadiz Pike (today State Route 9) in Belmont County near the border with Harrison County was named Henderson in 1877 after its postmaster. Stockdale was proposed as a name for the community, but upon the recent news of Horace Maynard's appointment to President Hayes' cabinet, the current name was selected.https://s3.amazonaws.com/NARAprodstorage/lz/dc- metro/rg-028/M1126/M1126-447/M1126-447-0854.jpg History The Maynard area saw initial development as Henderson's Station as a stop on the Cleveland, Tuscarawas Valley & Wheeling Railway. Purchased by the Cleveland, Lorain and Wheeling Railway in 1875, the line was still frequently referred to as the Tuscarawas Valley (T.V.) line. Maynard saw substantial growth as coal works were mined commensing around the time its post office was established through the 1920s. Railroad executive and coal mine owner Selah Chamberlain purchased land and developed a grouping of 77 company houses on a hill above Maynard, which would be called New Pittsburgh in 1883.

He is said to have baptized Saint Marina and her sisters after they were abandoned by their mother. He was martyred for his Christian faith in 135. Veneration The Portuguese call him Santo Ov√≠dio, and sometimes, by the folkloric S√£o Ouvido (literally \\"he who is heard\\" or \\"ear\\"), a folk-etymological translation of the Latin name Auditus; this name was then rendered as Ov√≠dio. Accounts of the 17th century assert that in Lusitanian archaeological sites, Saint Ovidius was depicted in episcopal robes or in the garments of a hermit; these depictions testify to an ancient veneration. His sepulcher can be found in the cathedral of Braga. Because of his name, Saint Auditus or Ovidius was traditionally invoked against auditory diseases. Under the base of his sepulcher in the cathedral, there were two holes into which the deaf would slip their fingers. They would then place their fingers into their ears by way of intercession with this saint. His feast day is June 3.

In 2013, David Bonderman's daughter, Samantha [Holloway] donated the funding to create a similar fellowship at the University of Michigan. While the fellowships share the same name (the Bonderman Fellowship), they vary in both eligibility and execution. Career Bonderman was an assistant professor at Tulane University Law School during 1967 and 1968; he then was a special assistant to the United States Attorney General during 1968 and 1969.

He was born in Berlin, the son of Ezekiel Landau, an Orthodox rabbi, and Helen (Grynberg) Landau. He was a music student at the Stern and Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatories in Germany. His family emigrated to London in 1939. In 1940, Landau came to New York City and was a pupil of Pierre Monteux. In 1943, he became a faculty member of the New York College of Music (after 1968 absorbed into New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development). Landau joined the Brooklyn Philharmonic (then called the Brooklyn Philharmonia) in 1955, an orchestra comprised at that time of freelance musicians in the New York City area with a focus on contemporary or infrequently performed classical music. His tenure as the orchestra's music director was from 1955 to 1971, when he resigned after the orchestra had reduced its season and programming opportunities during a period of financial difficulty. From 1961 to 1981, he was the conductor of the Music for Westchester Symphony (later the White Plains Symphony), until he left the orchestra over disputes with the board of directors regarding programming. He led the Chattanooga Opera Association from 1960 to 1973. In Europe, he was Generalmusikdirektor of the Westphalian Symphony Orchestra from 1973 to 1975. Landau's compositions included music for a dance drama, The Dybbuk, by Anna Sokolow. Landau was also a teacher at the Jewish Theological Seminary and the music director for Shearith Israel Synagogue, Manhattan. Landau married Irene Gabriel in 1954, and they had two sons, Robert and Peter. Landau often conducted the music for Gabriel's dance company in the 1950s and 1960s. Landau and Gabriel moved into their Brushton home in upstate New York in the 1980s. They died in a fire which destroyed the residence. Their sons survived them.

General  One of the largest recognized repositories of manuscripts, archives, photographs, periodicals and other primary sources of women's history, the collection consists of over of material documenting the historical experience of women in the United States and abroad from the colonial era to the present. The Sophia Smith Collection shares facilities with the Smith College Archives on the college‚Äôs campus in Northampton, Massachusetts. Subject strengths include birth control and reproductive rights, women's rights, suffrage, the contemporary women's movement, U.S. women working abroad, the arts (especially theatre), the professions (especially journalism and social work), and middle-class family life in nineteenth- and twentieth-century New England. Many of these collections are rich sources of visual, as well as manuscript and printed material. Open to the public free of charge, the collection does not circulate but is available to everyone, can be visited online, or requested as photocopies. History Sophia Smith The collection was established by Margaret Storrs Grierson in 1942 to serve as the library's distinctive contribution to the college's mission of educating women. The collection was later named after the founder of Smith College, Sophia Smith, who upon her death in 1870 willed her fortune of $387,468 (approximately $7,000,000.00 in the current market) to endow Smith College. In 1941, Smith College President Herbert Davis proposed the Friends of the Smith College Library that they take on as a special project a collection devoted to works of women writers. Smith College Archivist Margaret Storrs Grierson was appointed Executive Secretary of the Friends of the Smith College Library and Director of the Women's Collection in 1942. According to Grierson, President Davis was \\"not clear in his own mind\\" about what he wanted. Women's rights activist, historian, and archivist Mary Ritter Beard, \\"rather hoped that [Smith] would be interested in carrying on the work of the recently abandoned Women's Archives [World Center for Women's Archives (WCWA)],\\" which she had founded in 1935. Within the first year the scope of donations, coupled with Beard's influence, mandated that the project be redefined as a \\"special historical collection of women's materials, recording women's interests and activities in the course of human history and across the face of the earth\\". The donations, many from interested Smith alumnae, were indicative of a growing consensus of what the new collection should be: \\"... Such a collection would be primarily if historical value, almost surely offering...fresh material from which to rewrite the pages if our country's history.... The primary concern if gathering material on American women from colonial days onward should not, however, lead to the rejection [ij] material on women if other nations... .Among the Friends if the Smith College Library, many are especially eager. .. that the collection should be... differently formulated and would, I am sure, be if lively assistance in the plan.... This is the sort if collection which will gather impetus as it grows. I believe that we have good opportunity to develop a collection which... may be distinguished.... \\"'' As the collection grew, so did the proportion of manuscript to published materials and its recognition by a national community of scholars. Margaret Grierson explained her role in shaping the Collection's development in these early years: \\"President Davis did toss the idea if a collection if the writings if literary women, and I have been busy for years redefining the thing to make sense if it. In the process, I have more or less quietly won the approval and support and clarification if many intelligent alumnae and non-Smith women....I am the only one on campus who knows the women's field at all, and I have met only with support from he president although I have gone slowly, perhaps a little deviously, relying on accomplished fact to argue for me....In any case, I think you will understand how I came to go ahead... if the comprehension if those whose plan it is supposed to be. I am convinced that it is so sound and valuable an enterprise that it must be developed as fast as possible....\\"'' Collection development grew rapidly during those early years although as of 1946 the collection still lacked a name. According to Grierson, \\"the name of Smith College's founder was not used for other purposes,... and it seemed fitting to adopt the name of the woman who had founded the college to provide women with an education equivalent (not equal) to that offered men, for the collection which was to provide a better knowledge of the accomplishment of women through the ages.... \\".The Women's Collection became known as the Sophia Smith Collection shortly thereafter.  Collections  Copy of Birth Control Review, edited by Margaret Sanger, in the collection The Sophia Smith Collection includes over 500 collections (8,000 linear feet) of personal and professional papers of individuals and families, organization records, subject collections, oral histories, periodicals, photographs, and audiovisual materials.

The Crown appears in a number of Baroque iconographic and allegoric works of art to indicate the wearer's immortality. Wreath crowns Wreathed worshipper of Apollo, from Cyprus, 475-450 BC In ancient Egypt, the crown of justification was a wreath placed on the deceased to represent victory over death in the afterlife, in emulation of the resurrecting god Osiris. It was made of various materials including laurel, palm, feathers, papyrus, roses, or precious metals, with numerous examples represented on the Fayum mummy portraits of the Roman Imperial period.Lorelei H. Corcoran and Marie Svoboda, Herakleides: A Portrait Mummy from Roman Egypt (Getty Publications, 2010), p. 32. Gold wreath from ancient Macedonia In ancient Greece, a wreath of laurel or olive was awarded to victorious athletes and later poets. Among the Romans, generals celebrating a formal triumph wore a laurel wreath, an honor that during the Empire was restricted to the Imperial family. The placing of the wreath was often called a \\"crowning\\", and its relation to immortality was problematic; it was supposed to secure the wearer immortality in the form of enduring fame, but the triumphator was also reminded of his place within the mortal world: in the traditional tableaux, an accompanying slave whispered continually in the general's ear Memento mori, \\"Remember you are mortal\\".For a full discussion, see Mary Beard, The Roman Triumph (Harvard University Press, 2007), passim, limited preview online. Funerary wreaths of gold leaf were associated particularly with initiates into the mystery religions.Mark J. Johnson, ‚ÄúPagan-Christian Burial Practices of the Fourth Century: Shared Tombs?‚Äù Journal of Early Christian Studies 5 (1997), p. 45, citing Minucius Felix, Octavius 28.3‚Äì4. From the Early Christian era the phrase \\"crown of immortality\\" was widely used by the Church Fathers in writing about martyrs; the immortality was now both of reputation on earth, and of eternal life in heaven. The usual visual attribute of a martyr in art, was a palm frond, not a wreath. The phrase may have originated in scriptural references, or from incidents such as this reported by Eusebius (Bk V of History) describing the persecution in Lyon in 177, in which he refers to literal crowns, and also brings in an athletic metaphor of the \\"victor's crown\\" at the end: > \\"From that time on, their martyrdoms embraced death in all its forms. From > flowers of every shape and color they wove a crown to offer to the Father; > and so it was fitting that the valiant champions should endure an ever- > changing conflict, and having triumphed gloriously should win the mighty > crown of immortality. Maturus, Sanctus, Blandina, and Attalus were taken > into the amphitheater to face the wild beasts, and to furnish open proof of > the inhumanity of the heathen, the day of fighting wild beasts being > purposely arranged for our people.

The metaphor of the > \\"athlete of Christ\\" gaining the \\"Crown of Immortality\\" is developed further > by St John Cassian in On Gluttony\\" Ch 18 & 19 The first use seems to be that attributed to the martyr Ignatius of Antioch in 107. Advent wreath Candle-crowned Danish girls in a Lucia procession, 2001 An Advent wreath is a ring of candles, usually made with evergreen cuttings and used for household devotion by some Christians during the season of Advent. On Saint Lucy's Day, December 13, it is common to wear crowns of candles in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Italy, Bosnia, Iceland, and Croatia. Before the reform of the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century, St. Lucy's Day fell on the winter solstice. The representation of Saint Lucy seems to derive from the Roman goddess Lucina, who is connected to the solstice. Crown of martyrdom Christ Carrying the Cross detail, Jesus with Crown of Thorns by El Greco, 1580 Martyrs often are idealized as combatants, with the spectacle of the arena transposed to the martyr's struggle with Satan. Ignatius of Antioch, condemned to fight beasts in the year 107, \\"asked his friends not to try to save him and so rob him of the crown of immortality.\\" In 155, Polycarp, Christian bishop of Smyrna, was stabbed after a failed attempt to burn him at the stake. He is said to have been \\" ‚Ä¶ crowned with the wreath of immortality ... having through patience overcome the unjust governor, and thus acquired the crown of immortality.\\" Eusebius uses similar imagery to speak of Blandina, martyred in the arena at Lyon in 177: Crown of stars The crown of stars, representing immortality, may derive from the story of Ariadne, especially as told by Ovid, in which the unhappy Ariadne is turned into a constellation of stars, the Corona Borealis (Crown of the North), modelled on a jewelled crown she wore, and thus becoming immortal. In Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne (1520‚Äì23, National Gallery, London), the constellation is shown above Ariadne's head as a circle of eight stars (though Ovid specifies nine), very similar to what would become the standard depiction of the motif. Although the crown was probably depicted in classical art, and is described in several literary sources, no classical visual depictions have survived. Paper by Patrick Hunt, Stanford U. The Titian therefore appears to be the earliest such representation to survive, and it was also at this period that illustrations in prints of the Apocalypse by artists such as D√ºrer and Jean Duvet were receiving very wide circulation. In Ariadne, Venus and Bacchus, by Tintoretto (1576, Doge's Palace, Venice), a flying Venus crowns Ariadne with a circle of stars, and many similar compositions exist, such as the ceiling of the Egyptian Hall at Boughton House of 1695. Allegorical development The first use of the crown of stars as an allegorical Crown of Immortality may be the ceiling fresco, Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power (1633‚Äì39), in the Palazzo Barberini in Rome by Pietro da Cortona. Here a figure identified as Immortality is flying, with her crown of stars held out in front of her, near the centre of the large ceiling. According to the earliest descriptions she is about to crown the Barberini emblems, representing Pope Urban VIII, who was also a poet. Immortality seems to have been a preoccupation of Urban; his funeral monument by Bernini in St Peter's Basilica in Rome has Death as a life-size skeleton writing his name on a scroll. Two further examples of the Crown of Immortality can be found in Sweden, firstly in the great hall ceiling fresco of the Swedish House of Knights by David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl (between 1670‚Äì1675) which pictures among many allegoric figures Eterna (eternity) who holds in her hands the Crown of Immortality. The second is in Drottningholm Palace, the home of the Swedish Royal Family, in a ceiling fresco named The Great Deeds of The Swedish Kings, painted in 1695 by David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl. This has the same motif as the fresco in the House of Knights mentioned above. The Drottningholm fresco, was shown in the 1000th stamp by Czes≈Çaw S≈Çania, the Polish postage stamp and banknote engraver. The crown was also painted by the French Neoclassical painter Louis-Jean-Fran√ßois Lagren√©e, 1725‚Äì1805, in his Allegory on the Death of the Dauphin, where the crown was held by a young son who had pre-deceased the father (alternative titles specifically mention the crown of Immortality).http://www.univ- montp3.fr/~pictura/GenerateurNotice.php?numnotice=A1632&PHPSESSID;=94ee9dbdb5e603b4592e6280530673e0 image and Diderot's description Poems, texts and writing * Edward Grim wrote about Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury who was murdered on December 29, 1170 as the person \\"...promised by God to be the next to receive the crown of immortality...\\". * The preface to Percy Bysshe Shelley's 1818 poem The Revolt of Islam contain: \\"Should the public judge that my composition is worthless, I shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which Milton received his crown of immortality...\\". * A Latter Day Saints scripture, Doctrine and Covenants 81:6, contain: \\"And if thou art faithful unto the end thou shalt have a crown of immortality, and eternal life in the mansions which I have prepared in the house of my Father.\\" See also *Allegory *Circle of stars *Astral crown *Celestial crown *Five Crowns *Iconography ReferencesExternal links * Symbolism concerning Immortality * Crown of Thorn / Weapon of Christ Iconography Mythological clothing ","title":"Crown of Immortality"},{"id":"9618051","text":"The Capture of Rome () on September 20, 1870, was the final event of the long process of Italian unification also known as the Risorgimento, marking both the final defeat of the Papal States under Pope Pius IX and the unification of the Italian peninsula under King Victor Emmanuel II of the House of Savoy. The capture of Rome ended the approximate 1,116-year reign (AD 754 to 1870) of the Papal States under the Holy See and is today widely memorialized throughout Italy with the Via XX Settembre street name in virtually every considerable town. Prelude Camillo Benso, Count of CavourSchapiro, J. Salwyn, Ph.D., Modern and Contemporary European History (1815‚Äì1921) (Houghton Mifflin Company, The Riverside Press Cambridge, 1921, Revised Edition), p. 208 died soon after the proclamation of Italian national unity, leaving to his successors the solution of the knotty Venetian and Roman problems. The Austrians were still in Venetia and the pope was still in Rome. Cavour had firmly believed that without Rome as the capital, Italy's unification would be incomplete; for the historic position of the Eternal City, with its immortal memories, was such that Italians could not allow another power to possess it.Schapiro, J. Salwyn, Ph.D., Modern and Contemporary European History (1815‚Äì1921) (Houghton Mifflin Company, The Riverside Press Cambridge, 1921, Revised Edition), p. 218 \\"To go to Rome\\", said his successor, Ricasoli, \\"is not merely a right; it is an inexorable necessity.\\" In regard to the future relations between church and state, Cavour's famous dictum was, \\"A free Church in a free State\\"; by which he meant that the former should be entirely free to exercise her spiritual powers and leave politics entirely to the latter. Second Italian War of Independence Pope Pius IX around 1864 Napoleon III around 1865, by Alexandre Cabanel During the Second Italian War of Independence, much of the Papal States had been conquered by the Piedmontese Army, and the new unified Kingdom of Italy was created in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in Turin. On March 27, 1861, the Parliament declared Rome the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. However, the Italian government could not take its seat in Rome because it did not control the territory. Also, a French garrison was maintained in the city by Emperor Napoleon III in support of Pope Pius IX, who was determined not to hand over temporal power in the States of the Church. In July 1870, at the very last moment of the Church's rule over Rome, the First Vatican Council was held in the city, affirming the doctrine of papal infallibility. Franco-Prussian War In July 1870, the Franco-Prussian War began, and by early August, Napoleon III recalled his garrison from Rome. The French not only needed the troops to defend their homeland, but were concerned that Italy might use the French presence in Rome as a pretext to join the war against France. In the earlier Austro-Prussian War, Italy had allied with Prussia, and Italian public opinion favored the Prussian side at the start of the Franco-Prussian War. The removal of the French garrison eased tensions between France and Italy, which remained neutral. With the French no longer manning the Pope's walls, widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian government take Rome. But the city remained formally under French protection, and an attack would still have been regarded as an act of war against the French Empire. Furthermore, Prussia had gone to war in an uneasy alliance with the Catholic South German states that it had fought against (alongside Italy) just four years earlier. Although Prussian prime minister Otto von Bismarck was no friend of the papacy, he knew any war that put Prussia and the Holy See in opposing alliances would upset the delicate pan-German coalition needed for German unification. For both Prussia and Italy, any misstep that broke the pan-German coalition risked Austro-Hungarian intervention in a wider European conflict. Above all else, Bismarck made every diplomatic effort to keep Prussia's conflicts of the 1860s and 1870s localized and prevent them from spiraling out of control into a general European war. Therefore, not only was Prussia unable to offer any sort of alliance with Italy against France, but actually pressured Italy to remain neutral and keep the peace on the Italian peninsula, at least until Prussia's conflict with France had passed. Moreover, the French Army was still regarded as the strongest in Europe ‚Äì and until events elsewhere took their course, the Italians were unwilling to provoke Napoleon. It was only after the surrender of Napoleon and his army at the Battle of Sedan that the situation changed radically. The French Emperor was deposed and forced into exile. The best French units had been captured by the Germans, who quickly followed up their success at Sedan by marching on Paris. Faced with a pressing need to defend its capital with its remaining forces, the new French government was clearly not in a military position to retaliate against Italy. In any event, the new government was far less sympathetic to the Holy See and did not possess the political will to protect the Pope's position. Subsequently, the new democratic French government suffering under the harsh German peace terms provoked Italian public sympathy, and the prospect of a conflict on the Italian peninsula provoking foreign intervention all but vanished. Peaceful overture to Pius IX King Victor Emmanuel II sent Count Gustavo Ponza di San Martino to Pius IX quietly offering a face- saving proposal that agreed to the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of protecting the pope. Along with this letter, the count carried Lanza's document setting out ten articles as the basis of an agreement between Italy and the Holy See. The Pope would retain his sovereign inviolability and prerogatives. The Leonine City would remain \\"under the full jurisdiction and sovereignty of the Pontiff\\". The Italian state would guarantee the pope's freedom to communicate with the Catholic world, as well as diplomatic immunity both for papal nuncios and envoys in foreign lands and for foreign diplomats at the Holy See. The government would supply a permanent annual fund for the pope and the cardinals, equal to the amount currently assigned to them by the budget of the pontifical state, and would assume all papal civil servants and soldiers onto the state payroll, with full pensions as long as they were Italian. According to Raffaele De Cesare: Rome captured by Raffaele Cadorna General Raffaele Cadorna (Carlo Ademollo) In 1870, the Italian Army, commanded by General Raffaele Cadorna, crossed the papal frontier on 11 September, and advanced toward Rome, moving slowly in the hope that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Papal garrisons had retreated from Orvieto, Viterbo, Alatri, Frosinone and other strongholds in Lazio, Pius IX himself being convinced of the inevitability of a surrender.Rendina, Enciclopedia di Roma, p. 985 When the Italian Army approached the Aurelian Walls that defended the city, the papal force was commanded by General Hermann Kanzler, and was composed of the Swiss Guards and a few \\"zouaves\\"--volunteers from France, Austria, the Netherlands, Spain, and other countries--for a total of 13,157 defenders against some 50,000 Italians.De Cesare, 1909, p. 443 The Italian army reached the Aurelian Walls on September 19 and placed Rome under siege. Pius IX decided that the surrender of the city would be granted only after his troops had put up enough resistance to make it plain that the take- over was not freely accepted. On September 20, after a cannonade of three hours had breached the Aurelian Walls at Porta Pia (Breccia di Porta Pia), the crack Piedmontese infantry corps of Bersaglieri entered Rome. In the event 49 Italian soldiers and 19 Papal Zouaves died. Rome and the region of Lazio were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a plebiscite on October 2. The Leonine City, excluding the Vatican, seat of the Pope, was occupied by Italian soldiers on September 21. The Italian government had intended to let the Pope keep the Leonine City, but the Pope would not agree to give up his claims to a broader territory and claimed that since his army had been disbanded, apart from a few guards, he was unable to ensure public order even in such a small territory.For the Vatican during the Savoyard era (1870‚Äì1929), see also \\"prisoner in the Vatican\\" and the Roman Question. The Via Pia, the road departing from Porta Pia, was rechristened Via XX Settembre (September 20). Subsequently, in numerous Italian cities the name Venti Settembre was given to the main road leading to the local cathedral. Writer Edmondo De Amicis took part in the capture of Rome as an officer in the Italian army. \\"Roman Question\\": Mussolini's Lateran Pacts Via XX Settembre, Rome.Territory of Vatican City State, established during 1929 by the Lateran AccordsThe capture of Rome completed the unification of Italy. The Papal States had stridently resisted incorporation into the new nation, even as all the other Italian countries (except San Marino) joined it; Camillo Cavour's dream of proclaiming the Kingdom of Italy from the steps of St. Peter's Basilica did not come to pass. The occupation of Romagna (the eastern portion of the Papal States) in 1860 had left only Latium in the Pope's domains, and Latium, including Rome itself, was annexed in 1870. For nearly sixty years thereafter, relations between the Papacy and the Italian government were hostile, and the status of the Pope became known as the \\"Roman Question\\". Negotiations for the settlement of the Roman Question began in 1926 between the government of Italy and the Holy See, and culminated in the Lateran Pacts, signed‚Äîthe Treaty says‚Äîfor King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy by Benito Mussolini, Prime Minister and Head of Government, and for Pope Pius XI by Pietro Gasparri, Cardinal Secretary of State, on February 11, 1929. The agreements were signed in the Lateran Palace, from which they take their name. In the subsequent Lateran Treaty of 1929, the Holy See renounced its claims over most of the city of Rome in return for Italy's recognition of the Vatican State.
