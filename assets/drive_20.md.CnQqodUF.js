The Ecological Building design process is a modern architecture variant of permaculture design. An Ecological Building is a structure that is designed to create and sustain mutually beneficial relationships with all of the elements of its local ecology. A building's local ecology, or environment, is made up of particular physical and biological elements and their interactions. The abiotic, or physical elements are defined by the local geology and the local climate. The local geology is defined by the soil type, substrata, local land use, and water patterns of the site and its surroundings. The local climate is made up of the weather patterns, wind patterns, solar patterns, and pollution patterns for the site and its surroundings. The biotic or living elements are all of the local species and local ecosystems - including humans and urban ecologies - that interact with the site. This concept is distinctly different from green building, or sustainable architecture where the goal is to \\"minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings\\".sustainable architecture Wikipedia August 21, 2007 Ecological building is a positive design goal that sets out to increase beneficial interactions, whereas green building is a negative design outlook that seeks only the reduction of negative interactions. Inherent in green building is the assumption that any human interaction with a site is unavoidably negative, and that mitigating these negative impacts is the best that is possible. With Ecological Building, the designer acknowledges that humans can play an integral, beneficial role in improving and sustaining the health and vitality of their local ecology.

Seated in Frankfurt am Main, it represents 89,000 clubs and 27,000,000 members, about a third of the population of Germany.  Presidential Board  DOSB-President is Alfons H√∂rmann. Also members of the presidential board are: *Stephan Abel (Vice President, economy and finances) *Ole Bischof (Vice President, competitive sports) *Walter Schneeloch (Vice President, popular sports and development of sports) *Gudrun Doll-Tepper (Vice President, education and olympic breeding) *Petra Tzschoppe (Vice President, women and equality) *Ingo-Rolf Weiss (chairman of Deutsche Sportjugend) *Christian Schreiber (representative of the athletes) *Claudia Bokel (German IOC Member) *Thomas Bach (IOC President)  Executive Board  *Michael Vesper (CEO) *Thomas Arnold *Dirk Schimmelpfennig *Martin Sch√∂nwandt *Karin Fehres  History and structure  History and Structure Deutsches Sportabzeichen in Gold As one of the first nations, Germany founded a NOC in 1895, purposefully named \\"Komitee f√ºr die Beteiligung Deutschlands an den Olympischen Spielen zu Athen\\" (\\"Committee for the participation of Germany at the Olympic Games in Athens\\"). It was recognized by the IOC, and Germany took part in 1896 for the first time. The name of the temporary NOC changed to reflect the next two host towns, before it became permanent after 1904. The 1916 Summer Olympics had been awarded to Berlin, but were canceled because of the duration of World War I, with Germany and other Central Powers getting excluded from the \\"Olympic family\\" which was dominated by the Entente Powers. Thus, in 1917, the \\"Deutscher Reichsausschuss f√ºr Olympische Spiele\\" (DRA, DRAfOS \\"German Imperial Commission for Olympic Games\\") was renamed Deutscher Reichsausschuss f√ºr Leibes√ºbungen (DRL, \\"German Imperial Commission for Physical Exercise\\") to reflect and protest the non- Olympic situation. In lieu of the Olympic Games of 1920, for which Germany and its allies were not invited, \\"Deutsche Kampfspiele\\" (\\"German Sports Contests\\") were organized, both for Summer and Winter, with the 1922 Winter edition predating the first Olympic Winter Games by two years. Hardly surprising, Berlin, having been prepared for 1916, was the site for the first Summer event: * 1922 Garmisch und Partenkirchen (Oberbayern)  18. - ??. June 1922 Berlin * 1926 Triberg und Titisee (Schwarzwald)  4. - 11. July 1926 K√∂ln * 1930 Krummh√ºbel (Riesengebirge)  26. - 29. June 1930 Breslau Unlike others, Germany was still not invited for 1924. In 1925, the DRL split up, to remain focused on sports in Germany, while the NOC section became the Deutscher Olympischer Ausschuss (DOA, \\"German Olympic Commission\\") in order to focus on international relations and the promotion of the return of Germany to Olympics. This succeeded for 1928, with Germany taking part in both games. The organisations remained separate, even though Nazi Germany took influence from 1933 onwards. In 1931, the IOC had decided to give both 1936 Olympic Games to Germany. After the war, Germany was occupied and partitioned. In 1946, the DOA was dissolved. Soon, in June 1947, Adolf Friedrich zu Mecklenburg founded a new provisional Deutscher Olympischer Ausschuss, which was not recognized by IOC as it did not represent any recognized state yet. On 23 May 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was established on the territory of the Western occupied zones. On 24 September 1949 the Nationales Olympisches Komitee f√ºr Deutschland (\\"National Olympic Committee for Germany\\") was founded in Bonn as successor to the DOA. In October 1949, under Soviet occupation, the German Democratic Republic was founded, which on 22 April 1951 founded a separate Nationales Olympisches Komitee f√ºr Ostdeutschland (\\"National Olympic Committee for East Germany\\"), in 1965 renamed to \\"Nationales Olympisches Komitee der DDR\\" (\\"\\"). Only in 1968 it was recognized by IOC as fully independent member. As a third German state, under French occupation, was the Saar (protectorate) (1947‚Äì1956), which also founded sporting organisations in order to take part in international competition, like football and the Olympics. The Nationales Olympisches Komitee des Saarlandes (\\"\\") was founded in 1950 and recognized by the IOC. After criticism due to lack of success in 2004, the Deutscher Sportbund (\\"German \\") (DSB) and the Nationales Olympisches Komitee f√ºr Deutschland (NOK) decided to merge in 2005.

The Appleton‚ÄìHartree equation was developed independently by several different scientists, including Edward Victor Appleton, Douglas Hartree and German radio physicist H. K. Lassen.Lassen, H., I. Zeitschrift f√ºr Hochfrequenztechnik, 1926. Volume 28, pp. 109‚Äì113 Lassen's work, completed two years prior to Appleton and five years prior to Hartree, included a more thorough treatment of collisional plasma; but, published only in German, it has not been widely read in the English speaking world of radio physics.C. Altman, K. Suchy. Reciprocity, Spatial Mapping and Time Reversal in Electromagnetics ‚Äì Developments in Electromagnetic Theory and Application. Pp 13‚Äì15. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1991. Also available online, Google Books Scan Further, regarding the derivation by Appleton, it was noted in the historical study by Gilmore that Wilhelm Altar (while working with Appleton) first calculated the dispersion relation in 1926.C. Stewart Gilmore (1982), Proc. Am. Phil. S, Volume 126. pp. 395 Equation The dispersion relation can be written as an expression for the frequency (squared), but it is also common to write it as an expression for the index of refraction: :n^2 = left(frac{ck}{omega}right)^2. The full equation is typically given as follows: :n^2 = 1 - frac{X}{1 - iZ - frac{frac{1}{2}Y^2sin^2theta}{1 - X - iZ} pm frac{1}{1 - X - iZ}left(frac{1}{4}Y^4sin^4theta + Y^2cos^2thetaleft(1 - X - iZright)^2right)^{1/2}} or, alternatively, with damping term Z = 0 and rearranging terms: :n^2 = 1 - frac{Xleft(1-Xright)}{1 - X - {frac{1}{2}Y^2sin^2theta} pm left(left(frac{1}{2}Y^2sin^2thetaright)^2 + left(1-Xright)^2Y^2cos^2thetaright)^{1/2}} Definition of terms: :n: complex refractive index :i=sqrt{-1}: imaginary unit :X = frac{omega_0^2}{omega^2} :Y = frac{omega_H}{omega} :Z = frac{ u}{omega} : u: electron collision frequency :omega = 2pi f: angular frequency :f: ordinary frequency (cycles per second, or Hertz) :omega_0 = 2pi f_0 = sqrt{frac{Ne^2}{epsilon_0 m}}: electron plasma frequency :omega_H = 2pi f_H = frac{B_0 e}{m}: electron gyro frequency :epsilon_0: permittivity of free space :B_0: ambient magnetic field strength :e: electron charge :m: electron mass :theta: angle between the ambient magnetic field vector and the wave vector =Modes of propagation= The presence of the pm sign in the Appleton‚ÄìHartree equation gives two separate solutions for the refractive index. For propagation perpendicular to the magnetic field, i.e., mathbf kperp mathbf B_0, the '+' sign represents the \\"ordinary mode,\\" and the '‚àí' sign represents the \\"extraordinary mode.\\" For propagation parallel to the magnetic field, i.e., mathbf kparallel mathbf B_0, the '+' sign represents a left-hand circularly polarized mode, and the '‚àí' sign represents a right-hand circularly polarized mode. See the article on electromagnetic electron waves for more detail. mathbf k is the vector of the propagation plane. Reduced forms =Propagation in a collisionless plasma= If the electron collision frequency u is negligible compared to the wave frequency of interest omega, the plasma can be said to be \\"collisionless.\\" That is, given the condition : u ll omega, we have :Z = frac{ u}{omega} ll 1, so we can neglect the Z terms in the equation. The Appleton‚ÄìHartree equation for a cold, collisionless plasma is therefore, :n^2 = 1 - frac{X}{1 - frac{frac{1}{2}Y^2sin^2theta}{1 - X} pm frac{1}{1 - X}left(frac{1}{4}Y^4sin^4theta + Y^2cos^2thetaleft(1 - Xright)^2right)^{1/2}} =Quasi-longitudinal propagation in a collisionless plasma= If we further assume that the wave propagation is primarily in the direction of the magnetic field, i.e., theta approx 0, we can neglect the Y^4sin^4theta term above. Thus, for quasi-longitudinal propagation in a cold, collisionless plasma, the Appleton‚ÄìHartree equation becomes, :n^2 = 1 - frac{X}{1 - frac{frac{1}{2}Y^2sin^2theta}{1 - X} pm Ycostheta} See also * Mary Taylor Slow * Plasma (physics) * Waves in plasmas * List of plasma (physics) articles References ;Citations and notes Electromagnetic radiation Waves in plasmas ","title":"Appleton‚ÄìHartree equation"},{"id":"12880415","text":"Guzmania roseiflora is a species of plant in the family Bromeliaceae.

The 63-storey, tower that the hotel was located in is at 1151 West Georgia Street, and was completed in 2016. The tower is the second tallest building in the city, after the Shangri-La tower located across West Georgia Street. The tower, designed by architect Arthur Erickson, is triangular in shape, twisting gradually with height up to 45 degrees from bottom to top. The building is described as having a 'hyperbolic paraboloid' form; the design is similar to the Absolute Tower in Mississauga, Ontario and Turning Torso in Malm√∂, Sweden. The developer, Holborn Group, is aiming for LEED Silver certification for the building. Holborn is backed financially by Tony Tiah Thee Kian, chairman of TA Enterprise.https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/01/politics/ivanka-trump-fbi- investigation/index.html The nine-level derelict building formerly occupying the site was demolished. On August 28, 2020 it was announced that the Hotel would remain permanently closed. Over 250 employees temporarily laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The hotel was informed without warning that they had lost their jobs permanently. History The initial project was cancelled on February 25, 2009. Buyers who purchased luxury condos in the tower received letters informing them of the project's cancellation.

On August 21, 2009, it was announced that the project would definitely resume, possibly as an even taller building (pending approval from the city) while keeping the same design by Arthur Erickson who died in May of the same year. Work on the project would resume as soon as early 2010, after the Winter Olympics (construction work was not permitted during the Olympics). However, it was not certain as of August 21, 2009, if the Ritz-Carlton \\"brand\\" would still remain associated with the project.\\"Developers simplify design\\", Daily Commercial News, August 21, 2009. Developers announced August 27, 2009, that the project will proceed. They are re-proposing the project, requesting a height increase from to . The proposal called for a higher number of smaller housing units with a more efficient use of floor space while keeping the exterior of the tower aesthetically unchanged (outside of the height increase). The new proposal went through a series of public hearings before Vancouver city council was scheduled to vote on it in November 2009. The project was finally revitalized in mid-2011 without Ritz-Carlton as the hotelier. The tower was posthumously redesigned from 58 to 67 storeys and an additional 2 floors of underground parking. In mid-2012, the new hotel tenant was announced to be Marriott. Excavation recommenced in the spring of 2012, with actual construction work beginning in August. By November 2012, the foundation had been completed and substantial construction had commenced, with half of the first floor of parking being completed. In 2013 at a local press conference, Holborn Group president Joo Kim Tiah, developer of the site, along with the Trump Organization president Donald Trump, accompanied by his three children Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric, unveiled the $360 million Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver. The 63-story condo and hotel complex opened on February 28, 2017, with Donald Jr. and Eric Trump joined by developer Joo Kim Tiah. The opening was met with public protests and a boycott of the ceremony by Mayor Robertson and other local politicians. The building consists of the Trump Hotel on the first 15 floors, topped by 217 condos on the remaining floors. On March 1, 2018, CNN reported that the FBI has opened a counterintelligence investigation into Ivanka Trump; scrutinizing her international business deals at the tower. On August 28, 2020, the hotel reportedly closed permanently and is filing for bankruptcy. The property's website is no longer accepting reservations.

His work has been exhibited internationally and is held in numerous public collections including the Guggenheim Museum, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco (SFMoMA), and The Metropolitan Museum of Art among others. He has received residencies at The British Museum, London, the Banff Center for the Arts, Alberta, and The Centre for Studies in British Romanticism, Grasmere. Bucklow is best known for his ongoing photographic series Guests (1993‚Äìpresent) and his improvisational paintings from the series To Reach Inside A Vault (2006‚Äìpresent). He is the author of numerous books and essays including The Sea of Time and Space (Wordsworth Trust, 2004), \\"This is Personal: Blake and Mental Fight\\" in Blake & Sons, Lifestyles and Mysticism in Contemporary Art (University College, Cork, 2005), What is in the Dwat: The Universe of Guston‚Äôs Final Decade (Wordsworth Trust, 2007), and the co-author of Bacon and the Mind: Art, Neuroscience and Psychology (Thames & Hudson, 2019). Life and work Bucklow was born in Flixton, Greater Manchester, England. He graduated with a degree in art history in 1978. Between 1978 and 1995 he worked as a curator in the Prints & Drawings Department at the Victoria & Albert Museum, London where he researched Romanticism, photography, and developed an interest in the work of William Blake (British, 1757 ‚Äì 1827). An account of Bucklow's career as a curator and the forces that propelled his transition to art praxis can be found in \\"Rhetoric and Motive in the Writing of Art History: A Shapeshifter‚Äôs Perspective\\" in Remaking Art History (Routledge, New York City; 2007). Bucklow's early work (1989‚Äì91) was conceptual and sculptural, often taking the form of plant species that he altered genetically or grafted together. In the 1990s he created two bodies of photographic work, The Beauty of the World (1991) and Guest - also known as Tetrarchs, that were foundational for Britain's contemporary negative-less photography movement. Guests was created using a 30 x 40-inch pinhole camera, built by Bucklow, with thousands of apertures to make unique cibachrome chromogenic prints. Tetrarchs were created using either a 40 x 60-inch camera, or one with a 40 x 100 inches plate size. Guest (1993‚Äìpresent) features silhouettes of persons that appear to the artist in dreams. Friends, family, and fellow artists like Matthew Barney and Adam Fuss are featured individually in the work as a collective of figures drawn by the multiple solar images directed through the 25,000 apertures in Bucklow's camera. His interest in personal mythology, Jungian dream psychology, metaphor and the use of personification was continued in his subsequent paintings. To Reach Inside A Vault is a series of large scale improvisational paintings in which a commedia dell'arte technique is used to generate the subjects or plot. These paintings were exhibited in Bucklow's 2017 retrospective Said Now, For All Time at the Southampton City Art Gallery, UK.

In 1740, while pursuing a vow, Captain Teod√≥sio Rodrigues de Faria of the Portuguese Navy brought a statue of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim from Set√∫bal, Portugal, to Salvador. Some years later a religious brotherhood (irmandade) dedicated to Our Lord of Bonfim was founded and a church to house the statue‚Äîthe current Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim‚Äîbegan being built on top of Montserrat hill, in the Itapagipe Peninsula, in the lower town of Salvador. The church sits on the only line of hills on the Itapagipe Peninsula. Construction on the church began in 1740 and it was inaugurated in 1754. The towers were finished around 1772. In the 19th century, the Bonfim Brotherhood built houses in the square in front of the church to house the pilgrims (romeiros) that come to Salvador every year to honour Our Lord of Bonfim. Structure The Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim is constructed of brick and stone masonry. The fa√ßade of the church is two- dimensional, with a central body flanked by two towers. The windows and elaborate volutes of the gable of the pediment of the fa√ßade are in the Rococo style. The lower parts of the fa√ßade were covered by industrial Portuguese azulejo tiles in 1873. They are white with a yellow tint and were designed to resemble those of the Church of Saint Francis in the Historic Center of Salvador. The church has two bell towers; they were crowned with bulbous roofs at the end of the 19th century. =Interior= Wooden ceiling of the church painted 1818-1820 by Franco Velasco. The interior decoration of the church was finished in the 19th century. The Neoclassical main altarpiece, which has the form of a baldachin with a cupola sustained by volutes, was carved by the master sculptor Ant√¥nio Joaquim dos Santos between 1813 and 1814; he is likely also responsible for its design. The nave has a single aisle. The church has six side altars; two on each of the lateral walls and two at the front of the nave. The side altars have paintings by Jos√© Te√≥filo de Jesus at center in place of the gilded wooden images of saints found in other churches of Bahia. The interior of the church has a great number of azulejos. There are 28 large- scale azulejo panels on the lateral walls of the church depicting the life of Christ. They were painted by Tom√°z do Carmo in Lisbon in 1855. Similar panels of azulejos were ordered from Portugal in the same decade to decorate the sacristy, but were never installed. The nave and sacristy have plain azulejos. Between 1816 and 1817 Ant√¥nio de Santa Rosa carved the ceiling of the chancel, its tribunes, the chancel arch, and two side altars. Another notable feature of the church is the wooden ceiling painted by Bahia artist Franco Velasco between 1818 and 1820, showing people thanking Our Lord of Bonfim for having survived a shipwreck. The sacristy, nave and other rooms of the church display paintings by another notable Bahia painter, Jos√© Te√≥filo de Jesus and were done in the 1830s. Festa do Bonfim The Festa do Bonfim (, \\"Feast of Bonfim\\") is annual religious celebration in Salvador, starting on the second Thursday after Three Kings Day (January 6). The festival dates to the 18th century, when Captain Theod√≥zio Rodrigues de Fria survived a storm at sea en route to Lisbon; he returned to Brazil with an image of the Senhor do Bonfim to the church, and celebrated its festival date within the chancel and nave of the church. The festival became a city-wide celebration by the 19th century, as noted in newspapers of the period. On the Thursday after Three Kings Day, the faithful gather in front of the Church of Concei√ß√£o da Praia, in the Cidade Baixa of Salvador, in present-day Com√©rcio (Salvador)Com√©rcio. It is led by a group of bahianas, or women in traditional white costume, with turbans and long, round skirts. After mass, the faithful take part on a procession that leaves the Church of Concei√ß√£o da Praia, cross to the hill of the Bonfim Church. Upon reaching the top, the bahianas, who are associated with Candombl√©, wash the steps and the square (adro) in front of the church with aromatised water while dancing and singing chants in the Yoruba language. The washing ritual is called the Lavagem do Bonfim (Washing of Bonfim) and attracts both Catholic and adherents of Candombl√©, as well as tourists. Multitude praying in front of the Church of Concei√ß√£o da Praia during the Bonfim festivities. The celebrations last ten days and end with a large-scale mass in the Bonfim Church. Many worshippers come from far away to honour vows taken to Our Lord of Bonfim. The church has a museum of ex-votos brought by the worshipers in gratitude after receiving a divine grace. The feast includes stands serving traditional food, souvenirs, traditional dances and concerts by local musical groups. Even though the feast is Catholic in its origins, it also reveals much about the religious syncretism between Catholicism and African religions in Bahia. In the Candombl√© religion, Our Lord of Bonfim is associated with Oxal√°, father of the Orishas and creator of humankind. The Catholic Church banned the washing of the steps of the church at various times in the 20th century by Archbishop Augusto √Ålvaro da Silva: first between 1929 and 1936, in 1943, and from 1948 to 1952.  Senhor do Bonfim bracelets  Fitas at the Cathedral of Bonfim Fita do Senhor do Bonfim (English: tape of Lord of Bonfim) is a souvenir and popular amulet that can be found being sold by street vendors around the Church.The fashion accessory is made from cotton and has the phrase \\"Lembran√ßa do Senhor do Bonfim da Bahia\\" (Remembrance of the Lord of Bonfim of Bahia). The term has religious connotations and refers to a representation of Jesus. Recently the Fita do Senfor do Bonfim was worn by a supermodel in Milano, resulting in a cover page in Elle. Protected status The Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1938. The structure was registered under the Book of Historical Works, Inscription 131 and Book of Fine Arts, Inscription 23. The directive is dated June 17, 1938.

Combat chronicle The 10th Reserve Division fought on the Western Front, participating in the opening German offensive which led to the Allied Great Retreat. Thereafter, the division remained in the line in the Verdun region until February 1916, when it entered the Battle of Verdun under command of General der Infanterie Max von Bahrfeldt. After a respite in the lines in the Upper Alsace and Champagne, the division fought in the later phases of the Battle of the Somme. It returned to Verdun in late October 1916. In 1917, it fought on the Aisne, including in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also known as the Third Battle of Champagne. The division returned again to Verdun in April 1917, remaining in the line until late July, when it went into reserve for a few weeks. It returned to the trenchlines near Reims on 8 August, remaining in that region until March 1918. The division then participated in the 1918 German Spring Offensive, including the Third Battle of the Aisne, and in the Second Battle of the Marne, the last major German offensive of the war.

The text has become a rite of passage for avant-garde theatre artists from the United States: La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, Judson Poets' Group, The Living Theatre, Richard Foreman, Robert Wilson, The Wooster Group, and Production Workshop at Brown University have all produced the piece. Stein wrote the piece during what critics often refer to as the final or narrative period of her playwriting career. From 1932 onwards, she had begun to rediscover and reintegrate stories into her dramatic writing, an element hitherto she had worked to exclude. In a letter to Carl Van Vechten, Stein identified her work on this piece as a breakthrough: \\"I have been struggling with this problem of dramatic narrative and in Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights I think I got it.\\"Ryan (1984, 55). Despite her newfound use for narrative, Stein did not, as scholar Betsy Alayne Ryan states, \\"leap foolishly into ordinary comprehensibility.\\"Ryan (1984, 56) The structure of action in Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights does not resemble that which is traditionally thought to constitute a play. The progressive development of a coherent plot that unfolds through the interaction between a configuration of figures is just discernible. This includes Faustus' relationship to Mephisto; the characters Faustus, Marguerite Ida, and Helena Annabel; and the various pairings of minor characters (Boy and Dog, Boy and Girl, Dog Mephisto and Viper, Country Woman Viper and MIHA, the Man from Overseas and Faustus, he and MIHA). The text does not allow for a stable diagramming or coherent identities. Like the speech- headings in Elizabethan and Jacobean texts, Stein describes her characters in a number of different ways, suggesting some degree of multiplicity in her conception of dramatic character (most explicitly present in the multiple characterization of \\"Marguerite Ida and Helena Annabel\\"). The play adopts a number of textual strategies that presuppose a relationship to performance, though it is performance conceived in a distinctly modernist way: as spatial meaning (like Artaud's mise en sc√®ne or Brecht's Gestus), self-referential (as Beckett's work increasingly became or as in Brechtian quotation), and unconstrained by any adherence to the conventions associated with traditional dramatic literature (from which each of these practitioners have displayed varying degrees of independence). Like Beckett, Stein is interested in an aesthetic of surfaces - of formal elements interacting in space - which do not serve the traditional purpose of the imitation of action. The aesthetic assumptions about performance embodied in Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights and the ambiguity in its textual composition produce elements unanchored from a referential process towards any reality other than its own occasion; it suggests a fully self-referential performance. The piece opens with Faustus (his precise name shifts and alters throughout the piece) looking out from the doorway to his study, which streams with intense white light from beyond, when Mephisto appears: :Faustus growls out.‚ÄîThe devil what the devil what do I care if the devil is there. :Mephisto says. But Doctor Faustus dear yes I am here. :Doctor Faustus. What do I care there is no here nor there. What am I. I am Doctor Faustus who knows everything can do everything and you say it was through you but not at all, if I had not been in a hurry and if I had taken my time I would have known how to make white electric light and day-light and night light and what did I do I saw you miserable devil I saw you and I was deceived and I believed miserable devil I thought I needed you, and I thought I was tempted by the devil and I know no temptation is tempting unless the devil tells you so. And you wanted my soul what the hell did you want my soul for, how do you know I have a soul, who says so nobody says so but you the devil and everybody knows the devil is all lies, so how do you know how do I know that I have a soul to sell how do you know Mr. Devil oh Mr. Devil how can you tell you can not tell anything and I I who know everything I keep on having so much light that light is not bright and what after all is the use of light, you can see just as well without it, you can go around just as well without it you can get up and go to bed just as well without it, and I I wanted to make it and the devil take it yes you devil you do not even want it and I sold my soul to make it. I have made it but have I a soul to pay for it. :Mephisto coming nearer and trying to pat his arm. :Yes dear Doctor Faustus yes of course you have a soul of course you have, do not believe them when they say the devil lies, you know the devil never lies, he deceives oh yes he deceives but that is not lying no dear please dear Doctor Faustus do not say the devil lies.\\" :Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights (act one, scene one) Despite this opening, Stein proceeds to marginalize the Faustian struggle between good and evil within the breast of Man, which is traditionally played out through the relation between Faustus and Mephistopheles, in favour of a conflict (if the play can be said to have a dramatic conflict in the traditional sense of the word) between Faustus and \\"Marguerite Ida and Helena Annabel.\\" In Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights, Stein - a highly-experimental modernist writer - dramatizes an archetypal modernist myth (of Man's uneasy relationship with his machines) from the competing - and gendered - perspective(s) of the multiple woman.

They grow naturally in rainforests throughout tropical South and Southeast Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia to New Guinea and as far south as New South Wales. Conservation At global, national and regional government scales, many Helicia species have been threatened with extinction, as officially recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and by continental, national and local governments. Sixteen species have official IUCN global conservation statuses of either \\"critically endangered\\", \\"endangered\\", \\"vulnerable\\" or \\"near threatened\\" (in terms of global extinction). Naming and classification In 1790, notable pioneer botanist Jo√£o de Loureiro described this genus as Helicia in his publication Flora Cochinchinensis. The type species for the genus was Helicia cochinchinensis, the type specimen of which was collected in Cochinchina, Vietnam. The genus name derives from the Greek word \\"\\" (√©lix), which refers to the petals, now called tepals, spirally revolving or simply rolling or coiling up on themselves, at anthesis (the flowering time when the anthers open). In 1831, botanist Nathaniel Wallich named Helicia robusta for a dried specimen of a cultivated plant in India, based on the specimen's earlier 1814 name Roupala robusta by William Roxburgh. Roxburgh's Calcutta botanic gardens cultivated the plant. From the 1850s to the 1860s notable German‚ÄìAustralian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller formally described several new Australian species. In the late 1800s and early 1900s Frederick M. Bailey concentrated further on additional Queensland species, writing descriptions of them in numerous scientific papers. In 1939, Hermann O. Sleumer described many additional Malesian species, especially in New Guinea. In 1955, he published a revision of the genus. In 1956, his treatment of the genus in Flora Malesiana was published. From 1969 to the late 1990s botanist Don B. Foreman, who was based in Papua New Guinea and Australia, collected numerous additional species, which he formally described before he wrote the comprehensive reviews and flora treatments for the two regions; notably in the authoritative Handbooks of the Flora of Papua New Guinea (1978‚Äì1995, to date 3 volumes), he wrote the chapters for Proteaceae and other families; and in the authoritative Flora of Australia (1981‚Äì, 60 volume series) he wrote the treatment of Helicia. From the 1990s botanist Richard C. K. Chung, based in Malaysia, published new species formal descriptions and a revision of the 13 species occurring in Borneo. In total, approximately 100 species have been formally scientifically described. Lawrie Johnson and Barbara G. Briggs grouped Helicia with Xylomelum in the subtribe Heliciinae, tribe Helicieae, and subfamily Grevilleoideae in their 1975 monograph \\"On the Proteaceae: the evolution and classification of a southern family\\". However, genetics studies showed these two to be relatively unrelated, instead finding the closest genetic correlations between Hollandaea and Helicia, and therefore classifying them both in the subtribe Heliciinae within the tribe Roupaleae. Diversity and Description Helicia glabriflora from New South Wales, Australia Helicia plants generally grow naturally as small trees, while some species grow as shrubs and some grow to medium-sized trees up to . They grow naturally across the Malesia region with the major centre of species diversity of about fifty species in New Guinea. They grow naturally in the south west Pacific ocean region, and in north and eastern Australia. They grow naturally across southern and eastern Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia and another centre of species diversity of about twenty species in southern China, extending to parts of the Indian subcontinent, the Philippines, Taiwan, and southern Japan. The plant family Proteaceae's 1,700 species (approximate) have their greatest diversity in the southern hemisphere and smaller centres of diversity including some Helicia, in the near northern hemisphere. The species diversity of the plant family Proteaceae decreases further northwards. H. cochinchinensis has the natural distribution reaching furthest north to Japan where it grows into trees in the mountains of warmer parts and where no other species nor other Proteaceae genera occur. The same Japanese name for this species, also means the whole genus and the entire Proteaceae plant family. In the New Guinea and southern China centres of species diversity, many species grow in forests, up to as tall as the sub- canopy, especially diverse in rainforests. In Australia, they are generally components of rainforests, and prefer richer soils, especially in the farthest south region of Helicia's global distribution, the Illawarra, New South Wales, south of Sydney, where only one species H. glabriflora occurs, preferring richer basalt soils. Cultivation In India and east Asia Helicias have been cultivated in botanic gardens, from the 1800s. In Australia they have rarely been cultivated, and were thought to have little horticultural value. The rusty-coloured new growth is attractive on some species. In some of the better known Australian species, the flowers and fruit are generally not prominent, and plants can be slow growing. They are generally propagated by seed, the viability of which drops rapidly with time.

Vacuum impregnation is a preferred OEM process that seals porosity and leak paths in metal castings, sintered metal parts and electrical castings that form during the casting or molding process. Vacuum impregnation stops casting porosity (a phenomenon that occurs in the die-cast manufacturing process and allows manufacturers to use parts that would otherwise be scrapped.) Porosity occurs naturally and is found in most materials. In metal castings, porosity is typically considered any void found in the casting. Casting porosity can be caused by gas formation or solidification while the metal is being moved from a liquid state to a solid state. This porosity can range in size, from sub- micron to voids greater than 10 mm, depending on the casting. Casting defects caused by porosity can affect the part‚Äôs structural integrity, creating a failure point. Porosity can also prevent the part from being pressure tight. This will impact performance if the part is designed to hold gases or fluids. Process Standards Vacuum impregnation is governed by Military Standard MIL-I-17563C and MIL-STD-276A as well as numerous proprietary and customer specifications. MIL-I-17563 tests the impregnation sealant. MIL-I-17563C demonstrates a sealant is compatible with the application and that the sealant will not degrade or fail over the life of the part. MIL-STD-276A tests the impregnation process. MIL-STD-276A provides the standards for processing to seal parts and testing process effectiveness. Process The vacuum impregnation process seals internal leak paths to make it leak free and suitable for use. In the course of sealing castings against porosity, the parts would be processed through the following four stations: #Impregnation Chamber: The operator would seal the chamber and draw a vacuum. This would remove air in the porosity and leak path in the casting wall. Parts would then be covered with sealant, and positive pressure applied. More energy would be required to penetrate the porosity with sealant than to evacuate the air. The operator would then release the pressure and drain the chamber. #Excess Sealant Recovery: The operator would remove excess sealant through gravity, rotation or centrifugal force. #Wash/Rinse Station: The operator would wash residual sealant from the part's internal passages, taps, pockets and features. #Cure Station: The operator would polymerize the impregnated sealant in the leak path. Vacuum impregnation should be done prior to final assembly. Specifically for metal castings, vacuum impregnation should be done after final machining. Final machining may expose any porosity, creating a leak path. These paths can cause fluids and gases to leak from the casting, causing it to be non-conforming and unusable. Common Applications Porosity is inherent to most manufacturing processes. Porosity is only considered a defect if it is interconnected and creates a leak path can affect the part's structural integrity and performance. Vacuum impregnation seals porosity and leak paths for the following reasons. =Seal Leak Paths= This is the main reason why vacuum impregnation is used on any material-die cast, powder metal, plastic, wire harnesses. Vacuum impregnation prevents fluids or gases from leaking by sealing the porosity and leak paths. If the leak paths are not sealed, then fluids or gases may leak from the part. =Improve Machinability= Impregnation is used to improve machinability on powder metallurgy. Secondary machine operations, such as drilling, tapping, or cutting, are only marginally successful because voids between the particles cause tool chatter, reducing tool life and finish quality. Vacuum impregnation stabilizes and supports the individual powdered metal granules during machining. Vacuum impregnation improves machinability by making it more efficient, eliminating tool chatter, and improving the machined finish. =Prohibit Corrosion= Plating operations submerge the parts in acid solutions. The residual acid can seep into the porosity, which causes corrosion. Sealing the components before plating eliminates corrosion. =Enhance Secondary Finishing= The porosity may absorb oils, fluids, deburring fluids, pre-plating cleaners, and acids. If not sealed, then any gases or fluids may affect the finish by outgassing or bleeding out. Sealing the leak paths before secondary finishes will eliminate any failure mode that could develop from outgassing, chemical compatibility, or bleed out of pretreatments. =Improve Part Integrity= Vacuum impregnation can be used to part the integrity of additive manufacturing parts. An additive manufacturing part is not as dense ‚Äî and thus not as strong ‚Äî as a part made from traditional manufacturing processes. Vacuum impregnation can be used to strengthen the material. As the vacuum impregnation sealant cures within the perforations, it creates a bond between the part layers. This enhances the part by increasing density. Common Materials =Additive Manufacturing= Parts created through the additive manufacturing process are susceptible to the same porosity that plagues those created through more traditional methods. The porosity is inherent to the properties of the material and technology. The two primary materials that vacuum impregnation seals are plastic and sintered metal. =Die Castings= Die castings and permanent mold castings commonly contain internal porosity. This porosity is generally localized to the deepest cross-sections of the part and does not extend to the outer skin. However, if the part is also machined, the internal porosity will be exposed and the part will leak if pressurized. Machined die castings that need to hold fluids (intake manifolds, coolant connectors, transmission cases, pump housings and fluid power components) are routinely sealed for life using acrylic resins. Because the sealant is internal to the part, the exterior dimensions and appearance of the part are unchanged. =Powder metallurgy= Powder metallurgy (PM) components are sealed for four main reasons. The first is that PM parts are sealed to prevent fluids or gases from leaking under pressure. PM applications for compressed air, fuel handling or hydraulic housings are common and effective; however, they must be sealed first. If not sealed, then fluids or gases will leak from the part. Sealing the parts will not change the component's dimensional or functional characteristics. PM parts are sealed prior to plating and to reduce internal corrosion. Plating operations typically involve submerging the parts in acid solutions. After plating, residual acid internal to the part can promote corrosion and/or preclude an acceptable plating finish. The solution to this problem is to seal the internal voids prior to plating. As explained above, the porosity is saturated with monomer and is then rinsed completely clear of the surface. The resin cures to a durable polymer. Thus, the exposed surface metal is free to be plated while the interior spaces are sealed dry. Powder metal is also impregnated to enhance maintainability. PM parts are generally difficult to machine and some compositions may not be machinable without ruining the cutting tool. Secondary machine operations, such as drilling, tapping, or cutting, are impaired as the voids between the particles cause tool chatter, reducing tool life and degrading the finish quality. Vacuum impregnation stabilizes and supports the individual powdered metal granules during machining. This improves machinability by making it more efficient, eliminating tool chatter, and improving the machined finish. Powder metal porosity absorbs oils, fluids, deburring fluids, pre-plating cleaners, and acids. If the porosity is not sealed, fluids may bleed out and negatively affect the finish. Sealing the porosity before secondary finishes will eliminate any failure mode that could develop from bleed out of pretreatments.

Inspiration McGrath draws inspiration for many sources, using materials such as feathers, gold leaf, and leather.Summerton, Ema, \\"6 Model Muses That Have Inspired Makeup Artist Pat McGrath\\", Allure Magazine (2017). McGrath told Vogue in 2008, \\"I'm influenced a lot by the fabrics I see, the colours that are in the collections and the girl's faces. It's always a challenge but that's the key ‚Äì to make it different every time.\\" Her inspiration started with her mother, particularly her love for fashion, film and costumes:Ying Chu, \\"Makeup Artist Pat McGrath Talks Inspiration, Favorite Products, and What She Really Thinks About Nail Art\\", Glamour (2013).\\"Everything that she was obsessed with, I became obsessed with.\\" McGrath's mother encouraged her stating \\"It will be a problem for you if you don't love what you do. So make sure!\\" Growing up in London, McGrath and her mother used to go makeup shopping when she was six years old. Fashion became a huge inspiration for McGrath, stimulating her creative approach. McGrath also looks to models that bring her personal inspiration. McGrath says, \\"They are their own women, representing a mix of ethnicities, sizes, and backgrounds, they allow me to experiment and create the looks I dream of in my head.\\" She considers models Naomi Campbell, Hailey Baldwin, Paloma Elsesser, Jasmine Sanders, Mallory Merk and Ruby Aldridge as her muses. She says of Campbell, \\"We've worked together since the mid-1990s, and she inspires me in ways I've never imagined. There is no one like Naomi.\\" McGrath calls Paloma Elsesser's face \\"the ultimate canvas\\", for her hypnotic complexion that \\"guides a makeup artist's touch.\\" Much of McGrath's inspiration derives from making the natural skin salient.Jade Taylor, \\"Makeup Artist Pat McGrath Talks Beauty Icons And Her Highlighter Kit,\\" Nylon Magazine (2016). This can be seen in her own makeup line, which focuses on luminous skin. McGrath says, \\"Flawless, luminous skin has always been a constant in my work. For years I've been using a custom mix of products to achieve different levels of luminosity from fresh baby skin to a supercharged power-glow.\\" The sequin packaging of her makeup line also derives from McGrath's inspiration of sequins, a reoccurring element in many of her looks. The most important element of McGrath's inspiration stems from unique individuality and beauty, breaking away from traditional standards. McGrath values beauty beyond superficiality, looking at the story behind the person she sees. On the definition of beauty, she believes that \\"real and true beauty comes from within. It's like an energy, because the task of bringing out beauty‚Äîand at times creating it‚Äîreally is like a puzzle. Often in my work, the approach to beauty is to seek perfection, yet sometimes beauty is imperfect or quite raw.\\" References External links 1970 births Living people British make-up artists English people of Jamaican descent People from Northampton Members of the Order of the British Empire British cosmetics businesspeople ","title":"Pat McGrath (make-up artist)"},{"id":"12881433","text":"Heliciopsis is a genus of about thirteen species of trees, constituting part of the flowering plant family Proteaceae.

His father, Rafael de Zayas Enriquez (1848‚Äì1932), was a noted historian, orator, and lawyer, named Poet Laureate of his country. In 1907, opposition to the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz forced the de Zayas family to flee their homeland and settle in New York. There, George's brother, Marius de Zayas (1880‚Äì1961), became a well-known caricature artist and art dealer. At the age of 16, George left for Paris to study art, where he met some of the most important artists of the day. In 1919, he contributed eleven caricatures to the portfolio by Curnonsky, pseudonym of the French writer Maurice Edmond Sailland (1872‚Äì1956), who later became a well-known food critic. The portfolio was entitled Huit Peintres, deux sculpteurs et un musician tres modernes. The eight painters mentioned in the title were Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Henri Matisse, Marie Laurencin, Jean Metzinger, Francis Picabia, Pablo Picasso and Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes; the sculptors Alexander Archipenko and Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi; and the musician Eric Satie. It was also while living in Paris that de Zayas gave Marcel Duchamp a comet- shaped tonsure which was photographed by Man Ray, an image that has often been reproduced in the literature on this famous French artist. De Zayas returned to the United States in 1926, where he worked for a variety of magazines on a free-lance basis. In 1933, he designed the Huey Long Medal, and in 1938, joined the Artists Guild, where, for a brief period, he served as president. He ended his career as a commercial photographer, working for many years for the International Division of RCA.

Scotland's Places. Retrieved 4 November 2013. The island is in area, and at its highest point, Cnoc a' Chombaiste (compass hill). The bedrock of the island is Lewisian gneiss. The hillock of Cnoc a' Chombaiste is found to the northeast. The other main geomorphological features are Acarseid M√≥r (big harbour) to the west a \\"shallow and weedy inlet with a rocky shore\\" and Loch Hermetray at the island's centre. There are numerous surrounding islets. The largest is Vaccasay or Bhacasaigh (island with a bay) which extends to and lies to the west. Along with Fuam to the south and Hulmatraigh to the north this island encloses the sheltered Basin of Vaccasay. Fuam's full name in Gaelic is Fuam an Aon Fhoid, meaning \\"far out isle of the one peat\\" a reference to its shallow soils. Greineam and the skerries of Staffin and Creag na Stead lie to the north in the Grey Horse Channel and Grodaigh and the once fortified Dun Mhic Leathann to the south, beyond the Se√≤laid na h-Eala and close to North Uist. This strait is named after the Eala Bh√†n (white swan), a famous 17th century birlinn. Se√≤laid means a sailing channel, \\"fairway in the sea\\" or anchorage. Further northwest is the Cabbage Patch, a complex group of reefs and skerries including the islets of Opasaigh, S√†rstaigh and N√†rstaigh. History The island's name is Norse, Hermun√∞r-√∏y meaning \\"Hermund's Island\\", although it is not known who this person was. The Ordnance Survey also refer to the islet by its Gaelic name of \\"Thernatraigh\\".

Martin Martin visited the island in 1695 and said of it, that it had: \\"moorish soil, covered all over almost in heath, except here and there, with a few piles of grass and the plant milkwort. Yet not withstanding this disadvantage, it is certainly the best spot of its extent for pasturage amongst these isles, and affords plenty of milk in January and February beyond what can be seen in other islands.\\"Martin (1703) p. 42 Martin Martin also mentions that there is: :\\"the foundation of a house built by the English in the reign of King Charles the First's time, for one of their magazines to lay up the cask, salt etc, for carrying on the fishery, which was then begun in the Western Islands; but this design miscarried because of the civil wars which then broke out.\\" Martin was referring to Lord Seaforth's fishery, set up in 1633, but which collapsed a mere seven years later. It was part of Charles I's \\"Company of the General Fishery of Great Britain & Ireland\\". In 1841, a population of 8 was recorded as living on the island in a single household. Ordnance Survey maps published in 1881 showed six unroofed buildings on the island, which has remained uninhabited since the mid 19th century. A sheep fank at Acarseid M√≥r may be on the site of the 1841 house.

Reportedly the three survivors would not partake of a crate of whisky which was wrecked with them, and did not thank their rescuer, Alasdair Beag of Berneray, when he arranged for them to be returned to their home country. The Hebrideans explained this by the name of the ship, although the survivors spoke neither Scottish Gaelic nor English. Heremtray is currently owned by the Scottish Government and there is a fish farm in the Basin of Vaccasay.

(NFS) is an American company that has been a major supplier of fuel for the United States Navy's fleet of nuclear-powered vessels since the 1960s. In recent years it has also reprocessed weapons-grade uranium into nuclear reactor fuel. It operates a gated complex in Erwin, Tennessee. NFS is a subsidiary of BWX Technologies, Inc. The company has emerged as America's leader in converting surplus weapons-grade uranium from U.S. Cold War stockpiles into valuable low-enriched uranium fuel material to power commercial nuclear power plants. Known as downblending, the proprietary NFS process is currently being used to convert about 40 metric tons of highly enriched uranium (HEU) into fuel material for the Tennessee Valley Authority. In 2007, the company was also awarded a contract by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration to convert 17.4 metric tons of HEU into material for America's Reliable Fuel Supply Program. The company's downblending is also an important resource for the round up of other nuclear materials around the world to reduce the chance of proliferation by rogue nations or terrorists. NFS is also engaged as a team member at important nuclear projects at other DOE sites, such as the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility at Savannah River and the cleanup of an old laboratory at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Recent NRC Events  On May 11, 2008, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission released information on emergency notification of two 2006 incidents at the Erwin plant. The first incident involved a leak of liquid containing highly enriched uranium, which could have resulted in a criticality incident. The second incident involved an unmanaged 'accumulation point' - where a critical mass of uranium could have accumulated - was discovered while reacting to the first incident. In other words, no system protections were in place to prevent a solution leak from entering the bottom of an elevator shaft in the plant.

Under the command of group captain the Hon. Max Aitken, six multi-national squadrons formed the Banff Strike Wing. Between September 1944 and May 1945, crews flying in Mosquito and Beaufighter aircraft targeted U-boats and surface vessels in the North Sea, causing the loss of thousands of tons of iron ore and other vital supplies. More than 80 airmen from the Wing gave their lives during the conflict. The airfield closed in 1946. In 1989, the R.A.F. Banff Strike Wing Memorial was erected on the Banff to Portsoy road near Portsoy. Attractions In 2004, Boyndie's old school building was converted into a training centre for people with special needs, and a visitor centre and restaurant serving the local community. In 2006, Falck Renewables Wind Ltd built and commissioned the Boyndie Wind Farm, located on a disused World War II airfield. The wind farm has 8 turbines and when it‚Äôs operating fully it generates 16.65 MW of electricity. The local community owns shares in the wind farm through the Boyndie Wind Farm Co-operative Ltd, which is the first wind farm co-operative in Scotland.

Development and operations Philanthropist David Davies, 1st Baron Davies of Llandinam and president of the Ocean Coal Company and his Welfare Officer Captain J. Glynn Jones, co- founders of the Boys' Clubs of Wales were first inspired to build a holiday camp for the sons of miners from the South Wales Coalfield in the early 1920s after attending a youth camp in Kent. Opened on August 8, 1925, the camp offered them an escape from the polluted and unhealthy atmosphere of Valleys industrial towns and a place to play and be free, as well as being close to the nearby beach. 260px 260px The buildings included a dining hall, dormitories, a gym, swimming pool, workshops and a church. There was also a full-sized cricket pitch, putting green, tennis courts, football and rugby grounds and a pavilion. A War Memorial in the centre of the complex commemorated men from the coalfields who had lost their lives in the two World Wars The camp was requisitioned in 1940 for military use but returned to civilian use in 1946. In 1962, the centre was refurbished and a youth hostel opened on site as well as facilities for teaching work-related skills such as mechanical engineering. Use of the village declined with the growth of cheap holidays abroad and the decline in coal mining in the Welsh valleys. In 1990, the Boys' Clubs of Wales, the organisation responsible for running the camp, went into administration, forcing the site's closure. Status After closure, the site was used for residential Bible courses by various church groups. Sold in 2000 to a new owner, it was rented to a family who lived in the former caretaker's cottage and used the yard for farm storage. When they moved out in 2008 it was taken over by airsoft enthusiasts but with no on-site security it soon became a target for metal theft, vandalism and arson. Various buildings on site were subsequently demolished from 2008 due to extensive fire damage, including the Sir Maynard Jenour block (named after the Welsh industrialist)https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-maynard- jenour-1550738.html and the recreation buildings. The swimming pool roof which collapsed some years after the site's closure was also removed. In 2010, the owner placed the site on the market. Unprotected by any form of conservation order, the site could be cleared for redevelopment. In June 2011 the area was secured with gates and fences, as well as large boulders and rubble to deter vehicles from parking near the site, but by 2012 most of these had themselves been vandalised. As of late 2013 the site has been divided into 6 building plots, each plot has planning permission to convert the existing buildings into residential dwellings. As of Nov 2013 3 of the plots appear to have been sold STC. The war memorial will remain in the center of the cul-de- sac.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east- wales-23882642http://www.hrt.uk.com/Property/Residential/for-sale/Vale-of- Glamorgan/West-Aberthaw/Plot--Boys-Village/3059195.aspx In April 2016 a Planning application was made to produce 40% affordable housing by demolishing all buildings and redeveloping the church and caretaker's bungalow.http://vogonline.planning- register.co.uk/plarecord.aspx?AppNo=2016/00369/OUT&cuuid;=46A676BC-8EB5-4AA9-8ECD-19E4509E3C1A&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport;=1 In popular culture In 2010 the Welsh post-hardcore band Funeral For A Friend shot the video to their song \\"Serpents in Solitude\\" from their EP Young and Defenceless there.

Braco's Front Street is the busy A822 linking Crieff to the A9 road  History  Roman occupation on the Gask Ridge stretching across Scotland included the Roman Fort of Ardoch located to the north of Braco. The ramparts and ditches of the Roman camp are still plainly visible and it is a scheduled monument. In 1442 over thirty pieces of land were confirmed to Michael Ochiltree, the Bishop of Dunblane, by King James II of Scotland. These included the Braco estate, which at the time was known as Brecache. \\"Breac Achadh\\" means \\"Spotted Field\\" in Gaelic, i.e. a field partly cleared of bracken. A permanent fixture at the nearby Lodge Park is the Knaik or Knaick Bridge which dates from the 15th century. An interpretation board for the village and parking for the fort is also by the park entrance. The village of Braco was established in 1815 following the sale or feu of lands owned by James Masterson. The village marked the bicentenary in 2015 with events timed around the issuing of the first feus in May.  Notable residents  Famous past residents of Braco have included the founder of the Football League, William McGregor, computer game designer, Chris Sawyer and artist, Ronald Forbes. The anatomist Robert Howden FRSE was born here in 1856.  Amenities  Braco is home to a village shop, coffee outlet and outreach post office two garages, including a filling station. * Ardoch Church, part of the Church of Scotland and linked with Blackford * The former Free Church on Church Street/ Feddal Road, * An artists' studio on Smiddy Brae which is home to Lys Hansen. * The Braco Hotel, as of March 2015, being restored and extended. * On Feddal Road there is Braco Primary School and nursery class (serving Braco and Greenloaning www.pkc.gov.uk/article/17513/Greenloaning-Primary-School) village hall, playpark and a bowling green. * There is also a recycling point, managed by Perth and Kinross Council. * The Lodge Park is home to the annual Braco Show, an agricultural event. * Braco and its immediate surrounds are part of a network of core paths and walking routes through Strathallan, one of which passes a picnic area by the Keir Burn.  Media coverage  Braco is served by four paid for newspapers: the Strathearn Herald, the Perthshire Advertiser and the Stirling Observer. It is also covered by the Perthshire edition of the Courier, based in Dundee. Because of its location it also receives local radio stations which cover both central Scotland and Perthshire, such as Central FM and Tay AM/FM.  Transport  Braco is served by buses run by Stagecoach, linking the village with Stirling, Dunblane and Crieff, and Docherty's Midland Coaches/Stagecoach to Perth, introduced in June 2014.

It was mentioned in the Domesday Book but became more established as a mining community for the local coal pits in Norton and Chatterley Whitfield. A hostel existed on the east side of Chell Heath Road until the 1970s, where incoming miners from different parts of Britain and also overseas would be housed. There were several farms around the village which gradually sold for development. Some former farmland is now used for sport and recreation. In the 1960s there were three churches; an Anglican, a Methodist church in Brammer Street and a Primitive Methodist church in Unwin Street. Today there is a new non-denominational church called Emmanuel church on Chell Heath Road, close to the site of the original Church of England church. Nearby is The Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses. A Co-Op grocery store stood on Moorland View with an attached butchers shop. Moorland View also boasts a public house called The Talbot Inn at the junction with Unwin Street and, at one time, Bradeley Workingmens Club on a site that is awaiting redevelopment. On Unwin Street there was a post office which was eventually transferred to the shop on the corner of Chell Heath Road and Hayes Street but has since been closed; it now serves as a sandwich shop. There were also a number of corner stores selling confectionery, ice cream, etc. A small store is located within the Bradeley Village retirement community located on Brammer Street, to serve the residents there. A public house named The Bradeley was built in the 1970s when housing was built and Stratheden Road opened up a link from Bradeley to High Lane and onwards to Burslem. Bradeley was also known for brickmaking until the early 1970s - the Wilkinson Bros. factory was located at Acreswood, on the west side of the village, where clay was drawn from a pit and high quality bricks made.

Endemic to China, this species was discovered for Western horticulture in 1907 by the British plant hunter Ernest Wilson on behalf of the Arnold Arboretum. It was growing on mountain cliffs at 'Hsing-Shan Hsien' in present day Xingshan County in the west of Hubei Province in central China.Heptacodium miconioides Rehder - online article in the series 'Tree of the Year' by Grimshaw, John http://www.dendrology.org/publications/tree-of-the-year/heptacodium- miconioides-2012/ Retrieved 11.14 on 16 May 2018 Considered rare even at that time, only nine populations are known to remain in the wild (e.g. one on Tiantai Mountain), all of them in Anhui and Zhejiang provinces and threatened by habitat loss. The species is now under second-class national protection in China. The Sino-American Botanical Expedition of 1980 collected viable seeds and sent them to the Arnold Arboretum where it was found to be readily cultivated. The plant is now grown as an ornamental around the world. Description Heptacodium miconioides is a deciduous large shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of . The bark of the trunk is papery and thin, light tan in colour, and exfoliates in strips or sheets. The upright, spreading, quadrangular branches give the plant a rounded, often irregular shape. The dark-green cordate leaves are opposite, 8‚Äì10 cm long by 5‚Äì6 cm wide, with entire margins and deeply impressed venation running parallel to the margin. In September, H. miconioides produces large shows of small fragrant white blooms attractive to butterflies and bumblebees,https://afrenchgarden.wordpress.com/2012/09/02/heptacodium- jasminoides-the-bumble-bee-tree/ the flowers five-petalled, < 13 mm across.Stebbings, G.

When the white corollas have fallen, the calyces develop into deep red expanded lobes which persist into November. The plant may be found in scrub, woodlands, and on the margins of broadleaved evergreen forests, often on cliffs, at altitudes of 600-1000 metres.Heptacodium miconioides Rehder - online article in the series 'Tree of the Year' by Grimshaw, John http://www.dendrology.org/publications/tree-of- the-year/heptacodium-miconioides-2012/ Retrieved 11.14 on 16/5/18 Six flowers, not seven Noted plantsman John Grimshaw, director of the Yorkshire Arboretum, relayed the following observation of H. miconioides from distinguished botanist Allen J. Coombes, (formerly of the Hillier Gardens and currently coordinator of scientific collections at the University Botanic Garden Puebla, Mexico): > 'Seven' is actually misleading, for the flowers in each capitulum are held > in two rows of three clustered around a central bud, which is not a flower > bud but in fact a continuation of the inflorescence axis, which will push up > as the flowers fade and develop a new ring of six flowers, again around a > central bud. Three such iterations have been observed. Cultivation Readily propagated from either seed or by softwood cuttings, the species has since become widely available in North America and Europe, and was stocked by 26 nurseries in the UK alone in 2011. H. miconioides is extremely hardy, and tolerant of temperatures as low as . It is also fast- growing, and can reach a height of in just five years; it is also very shade tolerant. All six of the first H. miconioides planted in the United States in 1980 at the Arnold Arboretum are still alive, indicating an expected lifespan greater than 40 years. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Notable trees In the UK, a specimen 8 m high (2012) planted in 1981 grows in the Flagpole Bed alongside Jermyn House at the Sir Harold Hillier Gardens, Ampfield, near Romsey. Etymology The generic name of Heptacodium has sometimes been said e.g. by the Missouri Botanical Garden http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?kempercode=k450 Retrieved at 11.41 on 17/5/18 ( erroneously ) to mean 'seven bells' ( with a second element derived from Greek Œ∫œéŒ¥œâŒΩ ( codon ) - 'bell' ), but was in fact coined by Arnold Arboretum taxonomist Alfred Rehder from the Greek Œ∫œéŒ¥ŒµŒπŒ¨ ( codeia ) - 'poppy head' with the prefix Œ≠œÄœÑŒ¨ ( Hepta- ) 'seven', giving the meaning 'having seven structures resembling poppy heads'. The specific epithet miconioides alludes to the similarities of the plant ( particularly its boldly-veined leaves ) to certain species belonging to the unrelated genus Miconia ( family Melastomataceae ). The common name in Standard Chinese ‰∏ÉÂ≠êËä± ( qi zi huƒÅ ) is composed of the characters ‰∏É ( qi ) 'seven', Â≠ê ( zi ) 'son' / 'child' and Ëä± ( huƒÅ ) 'flower' - whence 'Seven Son(s) Flower' ( 'Flower with seven children' ).

Arson in medieval Scandinavia (Old Norse h√∫s-brenna or h√∫s-bruni, \\"house-burning\\") was a technique sometimes employed in blood feuds and political conflicts in order to assassinate someone. In committing arson, a group of attackers would set fire to the home of an opponent, sometimes by quickly and surreptitiously piling wood, brush and other combustible materials against the exterior of a dwelling and set it on fire. Typically the attackers would surround the house to prevent the escape of its inhabitants, although women, the elderly, and small children were sometimes allowed to leave.Njal's Saga ¬ß 129. In Iceland Under Icelandic law as codified in the Gragas, quickfire could be punished by death only if the arsonists were killed in the act. However, if captured alive the arsonists had to be tried and sentenced to outlawry, even if they were thralls. Failure to observe these formalities could result in the killer of quickfire-arsonists being prosecuted himself.Eyrbyggja Saga ¬ß 31. In this edition the translation given is simply \\"arson\\"; however, the earlier translation by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson (Bernard Quaritch, London, 1892) uses the translation \\"quickfire\\". At least some Icelanders considered quickfire dishonorable, hence when the enemies of Gunnar H√°mundarson attacked his home they refused to burn him inside, despite the fact that it would have been faster and less costly in lives.Njal's Saga ¬ß 77. Members of Gunnar's clan showed no such scruples when, around 1010, they burned Bergthorshvoll, home of Gunnar's erstwhile ally Nj√°ll √ûorgeirsson, his wife Berg√æ√≥ra, his sons Helgi and Skarph√©√∞inn Nj√°lsson, and his grandson √û√≥r√∞ur K√°rason. It is because of this occurrence of quickfire that the name of the saga in Icelandic is Brennu-Nj√°ls saga, \\"The Saga of the Burning of Nj√°ll\\". One son-in-law, K√°ri S√∂lmundarson, escaped and later killed many of the burners. Here is the description of the arson of Nj√°ll's house : Another instance of quickfire is told in the Eyrbyggja Saga. According to it, in the late 10th century in Iceland, Ulfar, a freedman, was the victim of an attempted quickfire by thralls (slaves, or serfs) owned by his enemy Thorolf. Thorolf's own son, Arnkel Go√∞i, captured the thralls in the act and had them executed the following day. Arnkel's rival Snorri Go√∞i prosecuted Arnkel, at Thorolf's request, for the unlawful killing of the thralls.Eyrbyggja Saga ¬ß 31. The Sturlunga saga reports that in 1253, during the Age of the Sturlungs, the Flugum√Ωri Arson was an unsuccessful attempt on the life of Gissur √ûorvaldsson by his Icelandic enemies. This account is quite similar to what is told in Brennu-Nj√°ls saga : an assault against a house is faltering, so the attackers have the idea to use fire against the besieged defenders. According to Lee M. Hollander, it is possible that this account inspired that of the burning of Nj√°ll. However, the episode of the burning of Nj√°ll also appears in the Landn√°mab√≥k and several other sources. In mainland Scandinavia In both Norway and Sweden, arson had the specificity of being used by kings, either during succession wars (such as the civil war era in Norway) or during attempts at unification and expansion of territorial control by a king (for instance Harald Fairhair in Norway or Ingjald Illr√•de in Sweden). According to the medieval Swedish ballad Stolt Herr Alf, Odin himself advised a king to kill one of his vassals with quickfire. =Sweden= The use of quickfire by 11th-century Swedish king Anund Jakob earned him the nickname \\"charcoal- burner\\". In Sweden, at least three kings are told as having used quickfire as a way to kill their opponents. The semi-legendary king Ingjald Illr√•de (who may have reigned in the 7th century) used quickfire at least twice: first he used it to kill several invited petty kings in order to directly rule their territories, and lastly he used it to kill Granmar, the last independent king of S√∂dermanland., Ynglinga Saga , chapter 40 The regnal list of the Westrogothic law gave the 11th-century Swedish king Anund Jakob (King of Sweden 1022 ‚Äì c. 1050) the epithet \\"charcoal-burner\\" because of his methods. He was said to have been \\"generous in burning down men's homes\\". According to the Orkneyinga saga and the Saga of Herv√∂r and Heithrek, the exiled Swedish king Inge the Elder retook the Swedish throne by using quickfire against his pagan opponent Blot-Sweyn. This happened c. 1087 : The Altuna RunestoneJansson, S. B. F. (1987). Runes in Sweden. p. 150 in Sweden also tells that a father and a son were burnt to death inside their home : =Norway= In the Heimskringla, Snorri Sturluson records many accounts of quickfire used in the struggles between powerful men in Norway. According to him, Harald Fairhair, the Norwegian king traditionally credited with unifying Norway at the end of the 9th century, often used quickfire, as an alternative to, and in addition with, battles. One of his first deeds was the killing, either by fire or with weapons, of four petty kings in a single quickfire raid. According to Snorri, this allowed Harald to seize control over \\"Hedemark, Ringerike, Gudbrandsdal, Hadeland, Thoten, Raumarike, and the whole northern part of Vingulmark\\". Later, Snorri recounts how arson was used to kill a rival king when a conventional armed expedition was not possible due to the season : In contrast with Icelandic accounts of quickfire in the Brennu- Nj√°ls saga and the Sturlunga saga, where it is used when a siege becomes difficult, accounts given by the Heimskringla of arsons in Norway rely heavily on surprise, and setting fire to the targeted house is the first thing done. Thus, surprise and good knowledge of the target's whereabouts are at a premium. This is shown by this account of an attempt by Gregorius Dagsson to kill H√°kon her√∞ibrei√∞r, who at that time (during the civil war era in Norway) vied for succession with Ingi Haraldsson : During the civil war era in Norway, Erling Skakke burns the house of a supporter of the pretender Sigurd Markusfostre, as imagined by artist Wilhelm Wetlesen in the 1899 edition of Heimskringla. Popular culture *In Vikings, Ragnar Lothbrok murders his \\"former\\" enemy Jarl Borg's warriors by burning their couters. *In Saxon Stories, and its TV adaptation, The Last Kingdom, the house of the adoptive father of the protagonist Uhtred of Bebbanburg, Earl Ragnar, burns in similar fashion.

He also served as a player-manager in the West Texas‚ÄìNew Mexico League with the Midland Cowboys (1939‚Äì1940), Pampa Oilers (1941), and Wichita Falls Spudders (1941). Early years Hale was born in Glen Rose, the county seat of Somervell County, Texas, in 1896. He later moved to Estelline in the Texas Panhandle. Hale worked \\"picking cotton and stringing telephone wires\\" as a young man in Texas. Professional baseball =Muskogee and San Antonio= In April 1917, Hale began his professional baseball career with the Muskogee Reds of the Western Association. Less than one week after joining the club, Hale was nearly killed by an elevator in the Baltimore Hotel. The elevator began descending unexpectedly, \\"crushing Hale between the wall and the top of the car,\\" leaving Hale hanging by his finger tips from the fifth floor landing. The impact tore the muscles above Hale's left knee and \\"mashed\\" the right leg below the knee \\"so that the skin rested against the bone.\\" Hale went on to appear in 116 games, mostly at shortstop, for Muskogee. He hit 32 doubles, eight triples, 17 home runs, and compiled a .284 batting average. In August 1917, Hale was \\"recalled\\" by the San Antonio Bronchos of the Texas League. He appeared in 235 games for the Bronchos between 1917 and 1919. In 1919, he compiled a .346 batting average and a .515 slugging percentage while playing at third base for the Bronchos. =Detroit Tigers= At the end of the 1919 season, the Bronchos sold Hale to the Detroit Tigers. Prior to reporting to spring practice with the Tigers in Macon, Georgia, Hale \\"had never been outside the Lone Star State before.\\" (The report about Hale having not been outside the Lone Star State was widely published. However, he had played for Muskogee (in Oklahoma) in 1917. Accordingly, the report appears to be inaccurate.) Hale made his major league debut on April 20, 1920, and appeared in 76 games for the 1920 Tigers, mostly as a pinch-hitter but also in 16 games at third base and five games in center field. He compiled a .293 batting average, and he led the American League in 1920 in both pinch hits and at bats as a pinch hitter, tallying 17 hits in 52 pinch-hit at bats. In 1921, following a change of managers in Detroit, and with Ty Cobb becoming the team's player-manager, Hale appeared in only nine games for the Tigers and was limited to two plate appearances with no hits. Published reports later claimed that Cobb disfavored Hale because he wore a small fielding glove. The story later evolved with reports that he had unusually small hands that handicapped him as a fielder. One report from 1923 noted: > \\"[S]ome gloom-bird circulated the report that Hale's hands were too small to > enable him to field grounders cleanly. Sammy's fins were said to be second > cousin to a humming bird's in point of minuteness, and grave doubts were > expressed as to his chance to make the grade in big league company.\\" Bothered by the recurring reports, Hale later had his hands examined by a doctor who \\"pronounced his hands a trifle smaller than average, but not unusually undersized.\\" =Portland Beavers= On May 20, 1921, Hale was waived by Detroit to the Portland Beavers in the Pacific Coast League. He remained with the Beavers for two years, compiling a .342 batting average in 1921 and .358 in 1922. =Philadelphia Athletics= On December 5, 1922, the Philadelphia Athletics purchased Hale from the Beavers in exchange for players and cash totaling $75,000. Hale spent seven seasons with Connie Mack's Athletics from 1923 to 1929, playing in at least 80 games every year and in over 110 games five times. His best season was 1925 when he was among the American League leaders with a .345 batting average (10th), .540 slugging percentage (10th), and 11 triples (10th). He also had career highs with 49 extra base hits and 63 RBIs in 1925. Hale was credited with 46 double plays in 1927 ‚Äî the most in the American League among third basemen. He also led the league's third basemen with 20 errors in 1928. In 1925, Hale had a career-high 24 errors at third base for a .919 fielding percentage. =St. Louis Browns= On December 11, 1929, the Athletics traded Hale and $2,500 to the St. Louis Browns in exchange for Wally Schang. He appeared in 62 games for the Browns, 47 as a third baseman, and compiled a .274 batting average. He played his last major league game with the Browns on August 23, 1930. =Minor leagues= Hale continued to play in the minor leagues, including stints with the Portland Beavers (1930‚Äì1931), Indianapolis Indians (1932), Oklahoma City Indians (1934), and Tulsa Oilers (1933‚Äì1934). In 1935, Hale was the player-manager for a team from Coltexo, an oil camp in the Texas Panhandle. He also served as a player-manager in the West Texas‚ÄìNew Mexico League with the Midland Cowboys (1939‚Äì1940), Pampa Oilers (1941), and Wichita Falls Spudders (1941). In 1940, at age 43, he appeared in 111 games for Midland and compiled a .357 batting average and a .917 fielding percentage as a third baseman. The Brownsville Herald that year opined: \\"Hale is popular with both players and fans and if good will can put him back up the ladder he's on his way.\\" Family and later years In September 1917, Hale married Alma Charlotte Richerson in Estelline, Texas.(reprinting obituary for Alma Charlotte Hale, originally published in Amarillo Sunday News Globe on September 27, 1970) Hale reportedly accumulated a fortune during the 1920s only to lose it in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. After retiring from baseball, Hale took up golf and worked as a professional or greens keeper in Phillips, Shamrock, Vernon, and Memphis, all located in or near the Texas Panhandle. In 1966, he was inducted into the Panhandle Sports Hall of Fame. In 1967, he moved to Wheeler, Texas, and his wife died there in 1970. Hale died four years after his wife, in 1974, at Parkview Hospital in Wheeler after a long illness. He was age 77 at the time of his death and was survived by three sons and two daughters.

The genus was described too as Hexapora genus, with a species, Hexapora curtisii. It is endemic to Malaysia. It is threatened by habitat loss. Overview Genus and species were published first in Flora of British India 5: 189. 1886 as Hexapora, with a brief description. However, J.D. Hooker soon realized his mistake, there are 6 stamens with 2 pores each, thus 12 pores, not 6, and changed the name to Micropora. In some copies has been corrected, but the index still lists the name as Hexapora, the genus and the species are formally described as Micropora, citing in synonymy \\"Hexapora curtisii, p.189 of this volume.\\" According to Richard Chung, personal communication to Jens G. Rohwer, 19 Nov 2010, there is no material of this genus in KEP, and Kochummen had seen nothing but the type. According to Khoon Meng Wong, personal communication to Jens G. Rohwer, 19 Nov 2010, there are 9 sheets in SING. Characteristics Evergreen laurel forest plants of Cloud forest in Malaysia, Peninsula, in Penang Hill. Leaves evergreen, lauroid, alternate, spiral, leathery, petiolate. Flowers aggregated in inflorescences, small and fragrant. Tepals extremely short. Anthers dehiscing via pores. Fruit fleshy, a small berry. The fruiting carpel indehiscent and baccate. Fruit enclosed in the fleshy receptacle, 1 seeded. Dispersed by birds. Hexapora curtisii is a species of plant in the family Lauraceae, endemic to Malaysia. It is threatened by habitat loss. It was named also, Micropora curtisii (Hook. f.), Litsea scortechinii, Nectandra caudatoacuminata. Ecology The ecological requirements of the genus are those of the laurel forest and like most of their counterparts laurifolia in the world, it is a vigorous species with a great ability to populate the habitat that is conducive. The natural habitat is rainforest which is cloud-covered for much of the year. The species is found in forests that face threats of destruction by human deforestation. Because of the special lack of worldwide knowledge about the family lauraceae in general, very little is known about their diversity. The knowledge of this family on a national level is that to be expected in countries with limited economic means, i.e. the vast majority of species is indeterminate or at least poorly determined. On the other hand, a high percentage of recently described new species come from collections made in these countries. Therefore an increase in the study of the family on national level is of utmost importance for the progress of the systematics of the family in general. Recent monographs of the small and medium genera of lauraceae with up to 100 species per genus have produced a high increase in the number of known species. This high increase is expected for other genera as well, particularly for those with more than 150 species recorded, bringing an expected considerable increase in the total number of species of the family. A related vegetal community evolved millions of years ago on the supercontinent of Gondwana, and species of this community are now found on several separate areas of the Southern Hemisphere, including South America, Africa, New Zealand, Australia and New Caledonia.

Its motto was \\"Virtue Liberty and Independence\\". For a time, it was Philadelphia's most popular newspaper, but circulation declined in the mid-1930s. It also operated a syndicate, the Ledger Syndicate, from 1915 until 1946. Early history Founded by William Moseley Swain, Arunah S. Abell, and Azariah H. Simmons, and edited by Swain, the Public Ledger was the first penny paper in Philadelphia. At that time most papers sold for five cents (equal to $ today) or more, a relatively high price which limited their appeal to only the reasonably well-off. Swain and Abell drew on the success of the New York Herald, one of the first penny papers and decided to use a one cent cover price to appeal to a broad audience. They mimicked the Herald's use of bold headlines to draw sales. The formula was a success and the Ledger posted a circulation of 15,000 in 1840, growing to 40,000 a decade later. To put this into perspective, the entire circulation of all newspapers in Philadelphia was estimated at only 8,000 when the Ledger was founded. The Ledger favored the abolition of slavery, and in 1838 its office was burned by a pro-slavery mob, two days after it burned the new Pennsylvania Hall (Philadelphia). The Ledger was a technological innovator as well. It was the first daily to make use of a pony express, and among the first papers to use the electromagnetic telegraph. From 1846, it was printed on the first rotary printing press. The Public Ledger Building, on the southwest corner of 6th & Chestnut Sts. in Philadelphia, PA (1867, demolished in 1920, John McArthur, Jr., architect) The press room of the Public Ledger, 1867 By the early 1860s, The Ledger was a money-losing operation, squeezed by rising paper and printing costs. It had lost circulation by supporting the Copperhead Policy of opposing the American Civil War and advocating an immediate peace settlement with the Confederate States of America. Most readers in Philadelphia at the time supported the Union, although there was a strong contingent of Southern sympathizers and families with ties to the South, as Southerners had long had second homes in Philadelphia and sent their daughters to finishing schools there. In the face of declining circulation, publishers were reluctant to increase the one-cent subscription cost, although it was needed to cover the costs of production.New York Times, 3 Feb., 1894 In December 1864, the paper was sold to George William Childs and Anthony J. Drexel for a reported $20,000 (equal to $ today). The Childs era Upon buying the paper, Childs completely changed its policy and methods. He changed the editorial policy to the Loyalist (Union) line, raised advertising rates, and doubled the cover price to two cents. After an initial drop, circulation rebounded and the paper resumed profitability. Childs was closely involved in all operations of the paper, from the press room to the composing room. He intentionally upgraded the quality of advertisements appearing in the publication to suit a higher-end readership. Childs's efforts bore fruit and the Ledger became one of the most influential journals in the country. Circulation growth led the firm to outgrow its facilities; in 1866 Childs bought property at Sixth and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia, where the Public Ledger Building was constructed. Designed by architect John McArthur, Jr., the building had at its corner a larger-than-life-sized statue of Benjamin Franklin by Joseph A. Bailly (1825‚Äì1883), which Childs had commissioned. The quality and profitability of the Ledger improved dramatically. By 1894, The New York Times described it as \\"...the finest newspaper office in the country.\\" Toward the end of Child's leadership, the Ledger was estimated to generate profits of approximately $500,000 per year. In 1870, Mark Twain mocked the Ledger for its rhyming obituaries, in a piece entitled \\"Post-Mortem Poetry\\", in his column for The Galaxy: The Ochs era In 1902, Adolph Ochs, owner of The New York Times, bought the paper from Drexel's estate for a reported $2.25 million. He merged it with the Philadelphia Times (which he had bought the previous year), and installed his brother George as editor. Oakes served as editor until 1914, two years after Curtis bought the publication. The Curtis era In 1913, Cyrus H. K. Curtis purchased the paper from Ochs for $2 million and hired his step son-in-law John Charles Martin as editor. Curtis was owner of the magazines, Ladies' Home Journal and The Saturday Evening Post. His intention was to establish the Ledger as Philadelphia's premier newspaper, which he achieved by buying and closing several competing papers: the Philadelphia Evening Telegraph, the Philadelphia North American, and The Philadelphia Press among them. Philadelphia went from a peak of 13 papers in 1900 to seven in 1920, a time when the newspaper industry in the United States was consolidating in general. Under Curtis' ownership, the conservative appearance of the Ledger was increased: it avoided bold headlines and seldom printed photographs on the front page. Its conservative format has been compared by scholars to the Wall Street Journal or New York Times of the twentieth century. Curtis built the Ledger's foreign news service and syndicated it to other papers via his Ledger Syndicate. From 1918 to 1921, former President William Howard Taft was on staff as an editorial contributor. To broaden the market, and compete against The Evening Bulletin, in 1914 Curtis began publishing the Evening Public Ledger, a bolder paper designed to appeal to a broader public. Public Ledger Building (1924, Horace Trumbauer, architect) The Ledger suffered by competition from an ascendant The Evening Bulletin, which under publisher William L. McLean grew in size from 12 pages in 1900 to 28 pages in 1920, and from circulation of 6,000 to a leadership position of over 500,000 readers in the same time. The Bulletin's bolder and more commercial approach attracted additional advertising, which in turn drew more readers. Advertising, which comprised only 1/3 of the Bulletin in 1900, grew to nearly 3/4 of its pages in 1920. At the same time, the circulation at the Ledger stagnated. Curtis built a new Public Ledger Building in 1924 on the same site as the old, designed in the Georgian Revival style by Horace Trumbauer., p.101, p.31 The paper made money in the 1920s, but saw circulation fall in half and profits disappear in the Great Depression. Some observers criticized the paper for an indistinct editorial policy which may have alienated readers. On the one hand, it endorsed reform politicians, while on the other hand, the paper was decidedly anti-labor. The paper ran anti-union advertisements during the 1919 Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America strike, but ran no pro-strike ads.Klein p 546 Despite the circulation slump caused by the Depression, Curtis expanded by buying The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1930 for $18 million, but he did not consolidate the two franchises. When Curtis died in 1933, he was estimated to have lost $30 million on his newspaper ventures, with little to show for the investment. In 1934, the Ledger was absorbed into the Inquirer, and management was assumed by John C. Martin, the son-in-law of the second Mrs. Curtis. He became General Manager of Curtis-Martin Newspapers. The final years On April 16, 1934, the morning and Sunday editions were merged into The Philadelphia Inquirer (also held by the heirs of Curtis). The Evening Public Ledger continued to be published independently. In 1939 John Martin was forced out of the management of the Evening Ledger, and control was assumed by Cary W. Bok, Curtis's younger grandson. Bok spent two years trying to make the paper pay, without success. In 1941, the Evening Public Ledger was sold to Robert Cresswell, formerly of the New York Herald Tribune. Mounting debts brought on a court-ordered liquidation, and the paper ceased publication in January 1942.  Controversy  =\\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" and Bolshevism= On October 27 and October 28, 1919, the Public Ledger published excerpts from the first English-language translation of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The article was headlined \\"Red Bible\\". The paper published the excerpts from The Protocols, a text proposing the existence of a Jewish plot to take over the world, after removing all references to the purported Jewish authorship; it recast The Protocols as a Bolshevist manifesto. Carl W. Ackerman, who wrote the articles, was later appointed head of the journalism department at Columbia University.

The Maria Cacao legend is a prominent example of the mountain goddess motif in Philippine mythology; other prominent examples being Maria Makiling of Los Ba√±os and Maria Sinukuan of Mount Arayat.  Origin  The original name of Maria Cacao is unknown as it was not recorded before the Spanish changed her name in a bid to convert the natives to Catholicism. It is widely assumed her name is not indigenous as \\"cacao\\" is an imported term that came from Latin America when the Spanish arrived. Additionally, the term \\"Maria\\" was added by the Spanish to turn her Catholic in a bid to widen Spanish rule in southern Cebu. Like with Makiling and Sinukuan, it is assumed that Maria Cacao's mythology was present prior to Spanish arrival with minor differences.  Legend  The basic form of the Maria Cacao legend is that whenever rains flood the river that comes from Mount Lantoy, or a bridge is broken, this is a sign that Maria Cacao and her husband Mangao have either traveled down the river in their golden ship so that they can export their crops or traveled up the river on their way back.Argao: A Portrait of a Town She is supposed to live inside a cave in the mountain and the cacao plants outside it are supposed to be her plantation.Maria Cacao: Ang Diwata ng Cebu (Maria Cacao: The Fairy of Cebu) Rene O. Villanueva = Contemporary variants of the Maria Cacao legend= One contemporary evolution of the legend is its merger with another common Filipino mythological motif ‚Äì that of soul- harvesting boats. The new stories suggest that borrowers who fail to pay their loans to the goddess would soon find themselves facing dire consequences, as Maria Cacao's boat comes to take their souls to the next world.Michael Tan. Maria Cacao. 15 April 2016. http://opinion.inquirer.net/94297/maria-cacao accessed 15 April 2016 A very specific variant of this new element of the myth was reported in Cagayan de Oro in the aftermath of Typhoon Sendong (Tropical Storm Washi) when there were reported sightings of a boat with a woman at the helm traveling along the river and offering to pick up passengers. These rumors were accompanied by a warning not to accept invitations to board the boat because the woman was supposedly Maria Cacao \\"collecting souls for the next world.\\" In his regular newspaper column, anthropologist Michael Tan noted that this \\"soul harvester\\" function wasn't part of the prototypical myth and associated the evolution of the myth with the social need to invent stories as a means of coping with disaster, creating a context for the sense of despair and, to some degree, offering a scapegoat for the situation.  Interpretations and cultural significance  While the story is obviously mythical in nature and a colonial invention, it is cited as evidence of how long the production of tableya has been going on in the area. Tableya is Cebuano for round, unsweetened chocolate tablets made from cacao beans. It is a crucial ingredient in the Filipino delicacies sikwate (hot chocolate) and champorado.

John schools are usually a diversion program for people - almost exclusively men - arrested for soliciting the services of a prostitute, or another related offense. This often acts as an alternative to criminal prosecutions. However, in some jurisdictions, courts may sentence men to attend a john school program as a condition of probation. John schools often last for one day. Their focus is often on the experiences and harms of prostitution, such as the violence associated with prostitution, the sexually transmitted disease risks of prostitution, and the effects of prostitution on families and communities.\\"John School Helps Break the Cycle of Prostitution\\" by Sharon Boddy, Peace and Environment News, November 1998. Whether the John school is a diversion program or a sentencing condition, the client will often pay a fee to enroll. The fee frequently covers the cost of the program and sometimes contributes to programs to aid prostitutes, or community projects within red light districts. History The first comprehensive john school program was started in San Francisco in 1995 by the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and Norma Hotaling and was known as the First Offender Prostitution Program. First time male offenders who volunteer for the program are required to attend an eight-hour seminar on the negative consequences of prostitution of all types on neighborhoods, the Criminal Justice System, and the prostitutes themselves, and face the possibility of a jail sentence if they refuse. In the first 12 years of the still ongoing program, now called the First Offender Prostitution Program, the recidivism rate amongst offenders was reduced from 8% to less than 5%. Between 1981 and 2007, 48 john schools had opened in the United States. John schools have been established across the United States, in Canada, South Korea and in the United Kingdom. More than 15 John schools have emerged in the United Kingdom since the first British john school in Leeds which was led by Julie Bindel and opened in 1998. As the term 'john' is rarely used in the United Kingdom, john schools are referred to by several different names including kerb-crawling rehabilitation schemes or kerb-crawling awareness schemes. The proceeds from a john school in Toronto, Ontario, Canada finance an eight-week life skills-based course for prostitutes run through Streetlight Support Services. Evaluations of John Schools A 2009 audit of the first john school in San Francisco conducted by the City's budget analysis, faults the program with ill-defined goals and no way to determine its effectiveness. Despite being touted as a national model that comes at no cost to taxpayers, the audit said the program didn't cover its expenses in each of the last five years, leading to a $270,000 shortfall. Some critics question how john school curricula socially construct sex work,Gurd, A., & O‚ÄôBrien, E. (2013). Californian ‚ÄòJohn schools‚Äô and the social construction of prostitution. Sexuality Research and Social Policy, 10(2), 149-158. while others do note the influence of contradictory perspectives of both sex work advocates and critics.Cook, I. R. (2015). A vengeful education? Urban revanchism, sex work and the penal politics of John Schools. Geografiska Annaler: Series B, Human Geography, 97(1), 17-30. For example, an academic policy evaluation of the First Offender Prostitution Program in San Francisco found that the program \\"both replicates and contests competing and often contradictory gender ideologies and patterns of power. Specifically, the program‚Äôs enrollment practices and most of its content imply that men who purchase sexual services are rational sexual agents, while women who sell these services are (mainly) victims. ... The program thus illustrates the contested and contradictory ideological dynamics of gender-sensitive institutional reforms.\\"  References   External links  * Prostitution: From Wolfenden to John Schools - Research on John Schools in North America and the UK by Ian R.

At first, affected individuals may have difficulty sustaining attention and concentrating. Their judgment, insight, and memory become impaired as the condition progresses. Over time, they lose the ability to perform the activities of daily living, and most people with this condition eventually require comprehensive care. The signs and symptoms of familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies vary in their severity and age of onset. In severe cases, the condition causes seizures and episodes of sudden, involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (myoclonus) in addition to dementia. These signs can appear as early as a person's teens. Less severe cases are characterized by a progressive decline in intellectual functioning beginning in a person's forties or fifties. Mutations in the SERPINI1 gene cause familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies. The SERPINI1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neuroserpin. This protein is found in nerve cells, where it plays a role in the development and function of the nervous system. Neuroserpin helps control the growth of nerve cells and their connections with one another, which suggests that this protein may be important for learning and memory. Mutations in the gene result in the production of an abnormally shaped, unstable version of neuroserpin. Abnormal neuroserpin proteins can attach to one another and form clumps (called neuroserpin inclusion bodies or Collins bodies) within nerve cells. These clumps disrupt the cells' normal functioning and ultimately lead to cell death. Progressive dementia results from this gradual loss of nerve cells in certain parts of the brain. Researchers believe that a buildup of related, potentially toxic substances in nerve cells may also contribute to the signs and symptoms of this condition. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In many cases, an affected person has a parent with the condition. See also * PI12 References *National Library of Medicine.

History In September 1992, an outreach began in the October Palace in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church). Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of Pat Robertson's CBN and their television ministry into the former Soviet Union under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called \\"Kiev Christian Life Centre\\") officially on 4 October 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny Zhenya and Vera Kasevich, who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church. As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastor Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. In February 2014, Zhenya and Vera announced to resign and later, Yuri and Tetiana Ravnushkin were appointed as the new Lead Pastors of Hillsong Church Kiev. Ministries Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are three-part courses for new believers, named \\"Discovery\\". The church reflects the belief that small \\"connect groups\\" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or \\"people over 40\\", or those who like fishing or computers. Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe. Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006 =Conferences= As both Hillsong Church in Sydney and London, Hillsong Kiev holds three yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006. =Social work= The church has a history of helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centres. =Bible college= The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the \\"helps\\" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet- bloc countries also come for training. The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership. Offshoot in Moscow On 1 March 2007, Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in Moscow, with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and new people, held in April and May. In June 2007, the church successfully completed the registration process. As of June 2009, its average worship service attendance is about 200 people. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by Rick Renner. The church in Moscow was also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spent a part of the week in Kiev and a part of the week in Moscow. Music Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Church in Sydney, and recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich. There have been nearly 20 album recordings. Venues Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship centre, renting an exhibition marquee in industrial outskirts of Kiev for its services. It does own two offices, purchased in 2002 and 2007 on credit with instalments from both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. Criticism The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what Pentecostals/charismatics believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. However, according to Pastor Yevgeny Kasevich, he would not \\"go to the extremes\\" when teaching prosperity believing that \\"we are blessed (only) to be a blessing to others\\".

It exhibits the natural and cultural history of the Southwestern United States. History The Arizona Museum of Natural History was founded as a small museum in Mesa City Hall in 1977 with a small collection of Arizona artifacts, in a building designed by Lescher & Mahoney and built in 1937 with WPA funds, that originally housed Mesa City Hall, municipal courts, city library, police and fire departments. There were expansions to the building in 1983 and 1987, and in 2000 a new wing was added. The main museum complex is currently about , of which about are dedicated to exhibitions containing a collection of about 60,000 objects of natural history, anthropology, history & art, with approximately 10,000 historic photographs. A research facility was also added in 1995. Additionally, the Arizona Museum of Natural History has prominent research curators in the fields of paleontology and archeology/anthropology. Recent annual attendance is about 139,998. Exhibitions The Museum's exhibitions include a three- story indoor waterfall on Dinosaur Mountain, Dinosaur Hall, a real territorial jail, and a recreation of the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine. The Southwest GallerySouthwest Gallery info at azmnh.org consists of a native peoples‚Äô gallery, with exhibits about Paleoindian big game hunters and gatherers, the first inhabitants of North America, and the Desert Cultures that developed later. It also holds a recreation of a Hohokam village, with pithouses and above-ground structures, outfitted with real artifacts as they might have been from about A.D. 600-1450. Another exhibit is the Ancient Cultures of Mexico.Ancient Cultures of Mexico info at azmnh.org The Origins gallery Origins gallery info at azmnh.org is designed as a voyage through the timeline of the cosmos and discusses major events in the history of planet Earth. Among the exhibitions is a hands-on Exploration StationExploration Station info at azmnh.org and the Paleo Dig Pit.Paleo Dig Pit info at azmnh.org Three changing exhibition galleries offer a variety of subjects. The evolution of flight‚Äîwas it from the ground-up or from the tree down? AzMNH's exhibition, \\"Rulers of the Prehistoric Skies,\\" helped to answer that question. The exhibit has since been removed, but the pterosaurs are still visible throughout the museum. The skeleton of a Pterosaurs on display in the museum. At no other time in the history of life on Earth were there animals like the pterosaurs, those flying creatures who truly did rule the sky. They were the first vertebrates to achieve flight, and they did it in a way that was all their own. In addition to very distinctly shaped, thin, hollow bones, pterosaurs had membranous wings which were probably flexible and able to change shape during flight. The actual mechanical details are not completely understood by paleontologists, thus giving rise to multiple opinions. The main goal of the exhibit was to have visitors understand the amazing diversity among Pterosaurs. Exhibit volunteers helped to achieve this goal by building everything from ‚Äúrock blocks‚Äù and puzzles, to actual models of the fliers themselves. Don Puffer created a 4-foot mechanical Dsungaripterous pterosaur also known as ‚ÄúClam Digger‚Äù that demonstrated the opening and closing of its wings. Ed Mack's sculpture Pteranodon sternbergi is a stunning life-size model that should amaze the museum audience and now hangs over Dinosaur Mountain. \\"Rulers of the Prehistoric Skies\\" was part of a Mesa Arts and Culture First Flight initiative and focused on flying reptiles; however the exhibit also explored the evolution of flight from insects, the true first flyers, to birds and bats. The \\"Rulers of the Prehistoric Skies\\" exhibit opened on February 4, 2012, and ran for approximately four years due to its popularity. Another of the changing exhibits was \\"The Primal Desert Next Door: Land of Black Volcanoes and White Sands,\\" which opened February 26, 2011 and closed in January 2013. Much of the Sonoran Desert lies south of the Arizona border in Mexico. This vast expanse and its diverse wildlife is the focus of this exhibition, which included wall murals depicting the vast contrasting dark ‚Äúmoon-scape‚Äù volcanic fields and bright seas of sand dunes. Visitors were able to learn about the geology, flora, and fauna of this region though photographs and interactive components. The exhibition was based on the book Land of Black Volcanoes and White Sands, The Pinacate and Gran Desierto De Altar Biosphere Reserve, by Larry Marshall and Clark Blake. Interactive features included a dune machine, which replicated the phenomena of sand dunes, a hands-on basin and range topography display, and a mock lava tube, which children could climb through. This exhibition has since been replaced.

The village is the main constituent of the Brandsby-cum-Stearsby Civil Parish in the District of Hambleton. The village is mentioned in the Domesday book. It lies between Easingwold and Hovingham, some north of York. History The village toponymy is of Scandinavian origin named after a Norseman called Brand and the suffix of by meaning settlement or habitation. At the time of the Norman conquest, it was held by Cnut, son of Karli and afterwards by Hugh, son of Baldric. Later the village and the surrounding lands were given to Baron Roger de Mowbray. It was part of the Bulford Hundred. The Baron left the lordship of the manor to Nicholas de Riparia (or de le Ryver), whose family held it until the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. After this the Lordship passed via marriage to the Cholmeley family, descended from the Cholmondeley family of Cheshire. The lordship ended with the last of the Cholmeley family, Hugh Charles Fairfax Cholmeley, who died in 1940. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Brandsby was the production centre for the Brandsby-type ware of Medieval ceramic.Jennings, S. 1992. Medieval Pottery in the Yorkshire Museum, York, 18-21. The village was also the site for the York 37 Royal Observer Corps Post (Brandsby). The Nuclear Monitoring Post is located on the road between the village and Crayke at Zion Hill Farm. It was part of the York No' 20 Group ROC HQ and was opened in June 1964 and closed in September 1991. It is now a Grade II Listed building and although the Post had been restored the restorer has allegedly been evicted due to getting the Post listed against the farmers wishes. The Post website has been taken over by a company selling sunglasses. Governance The village lies within the UK parliamentary constituency of Thirsk and Malton. It is part of the Stillington, North Yorkshire electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council. It is also in the Stillington ward of Hambleton District Council.Ordnance Survey Open View The Parish Council is made of five councillors including the Chair.

Prostitution in Belgium is legal but certain related activities such as soliciting and pimping are illegal. Belgian municipalities may also introduce further prohibition or regulation. Human trafficking or exploiting individuals involved in prostitution is punishable by a maximum prison sentence of 30 years. Most Belgian cities have a red-light district, often with window prostitution. In 2015 it was estimated that there were 26,000 prostitutes in Belgium, many of them are from Bulgaria. A report commissioned by the National Bank of Belgium, estimated a turnover of 840 million Euro in 2015. The most important segments of the market seem to be escort and private prostitution, rather than the more visible forms of window or street prostitution. Legal Framework Prior to 1946 prostitution was regulated by the municipalities, with mandatory registration and medical checks. In 1946 Federal legislation replaced local control of prostitution, however the municipalities could still regulate in their local area for the sake of public order or morality Prostitution and paying for sexual services were not prohibited in the 1946 legislation, but Article 380 added the following offences: * Procuring * Procuring through the provision of premises (running a brothel, providing premises for prostitution etc.) for unjust gain * Aggravated pimping (violence, threats, deception or exploitation of a vulnerable situation) * Solicitation * Advertising for the purposes of prostitution The 1995 Criminal Law Reform Act made some modification to the existing laws: * Prohibition of soliciting was extended to include all forms of communication. * Legislation in connection with procuring was relaxed, providing abnormally high gains are not made (although \\"abnormally high gains\\" is not defined). * Increase in penalties for human trafficking. * Powers given to the courts to close premises and confiscate property. In 2005 the 1995 Act was amended to give greater power against human trafficking, including an increase in maximum sentences. It also brought Belgium law in line with EU and international instruments that had been introduced in the previous years. =Proposed reforms= There have been a number of draft bills proposing changes to the existing prostitution laws. Proposals from the pro-prostitution camp have included licensing brothels and giving special status within the law to sex-workers. The anti-prostitution lobby proposals have included the banning of windows and criminalisation of paying for sexual services (Nordic Model). As the legislature has been split over its views, none of the bills have succeeded. Local control Municipalities can impose local regulation on public order or morality grounds. Generally, these powers were little used until the 2000s, most preferring an \\"unregulated tolerance\\" approach. In the 2000s the municipalities took different approaches to regulation. Some, such as Liege and Ghent, banned window prostitution or moved it out of its traditional locations in the city centres. Others, such as Antwerp totally restructured its red-light district and heavily regulated it. Seraing is planning to build a new 'Eros Centre' to replace the existing windows. History Prostitution was known to exist in what is now Belgium since the middle ages. Regulation of prostitutes was introduced during the Burgundian regime (1384‚Äì1482) but often ignored. In Brussels, the public executioner was tasked with controlling the trade in the city. During the French regime (1794‚Äì1814) prostitutes were required to have mandatory health checks in hospitals. After the Belgian Revolution brought about independence in 1830, the regulations set up by the French continued. In 1844 identity cards were issued to prostitutes and twice weekly medical check-ups were required. The \\"White Slave Scandal\\" (\\"affaire des petite Anglaises\\") in 1880/1881 brought prostitution in Brussels into the spotlight. Over 40 minors, mainly English girls, were found to be working in brothels after being lured to Brussels with promises of work in bars and nightclubs. As well as those involved being prosecuted, the Mayor and Head of Police in Brussels were forced to resign. During WW1, the occupying Germans took over control of prostitution. In an attempt to prevent the spread of STIs amongst their troops, the trade was strictly regulated and girls forced to undergo regular health checks. The regulatory regime was regarded as discriminatory towards women in the 1940s, leading to Isabelle Blume's proposals being passed as federal law in 1946. Sex Trafficking Belgium is listed by the UNODC as a destination for victims of human trafficking, the victims being mainly Moroccan, Romanian, Chinese, Nigerian, Bulgarian and Tunisian nationals. The efforts by the Belgium authorities to eradicate trafficking was cited by UN Special Rapporteur Urmila Bhoola as \\"an example of good practice\\" in 2015 In 2016, 184 people were prosecuted for sex trafficking and 144 victims of trafficking were assisted. The victims are given help in specialised NGO-run shelters and when they leave the shelters, they are given protection, residence and employment permits and access to legal services. In 2017 there were 176 sex traffickers prosecuted and 59 victims assisted. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Belgium as a 'Tier 1' country.

Similar to ice wine, the use of frozen apples concentrates the natural sugars in the apples, resulting in a higher alcohol content than cider made by traditional methods. Ice cider was originally created in Quebec, made possible by the region's naturally cold temperatures. It is now also produced in other regions where the climate reaches freezing temperatures but also is suitable for apples. History Ice cider was first created in Quebec when Christian Barthomeuf, a winemaker from Dunham considered the \\"father of ice cider\\", created a recipe in 1989 inspired by the ice wines of Germany. Quebec's climate is much more suited to growing apples than grapes, and the same techniques can be applied to both fruits. In 1994, at Hemmingford in Monteregie, Barthomeuf worked with Francois Pouliot to refine and develop ice cider in much larger volumes, at the cidery La Face Cach√©e de la Pomme. The very first bottle sold under the official designation ice cider, from La Ciderie St.-Nicholas, appeared in a Quebec government-run liquor store, the Soci√©t√© des alcools du Qu√©bec (SAQ) in 1999. 1999 was also the first year the authorities allowed the use of the term ice cider, having not allowed it earlier out of concern it would be confused with traditional cider. Today there are over 60 producers of ice cider. This has inspired producers elsewhere, and ice cider production can now be found in the Western Canada, Europe and the United States. Expansion initially occurred in regions bordering Quebec, including the province of Ontario and the U.S. state of Vermont. In 2008, a provincial regulation by the Quebec government defined the conditions of production, and in December 2014, Quebec ice cider obtained a protected appellation (IGP), which establishes international rules and requirements on production. The Quebec winter allows apples to freeze in a natural manner that could then be used for ice cider. However, ice cider requires four to five times as many apples as it would require to produce the same quantity of regular cider. Currently, there are around 50 producers of ice cider in Quebec. The climate requirements have made expansion of production occur slowly, but it is beginning to be produced around the world. The U.S. state of Vermont is one area in particular where cider production is increasing. The continued expansion of ice cider around the world has resulted in the industry winning a number of prizes. In 2007, La Fundacion de la Sidra in Spain awarded Christian Barthomeuf their top prize for inventing ice cider and to La Face Cachee de la Pomme for contributing to the development and commercialization in Quebec and around the world.  Production  Ice cider can be made from two processes that concentrate the natural sugars within an apple through the use of cold temperatures: cryoconcentration and cryoextraction. The most common apples used for the production of ice cider are McIntosh, Cortland, Empire and Spartan. Due to cryoextraction requiring the apples to remain on the branches later than they are typically picked, new breeds of apple have been developed specifically for the production of ice cider. The process of cryoconcentration resembles slightly the process indigenous Canadians realized occurred when maple syrup could be concentrated by the cold. After letting it freeze, a piece would be broken off which would be more concentrated. The process of cryoextraction is inspired directly from the production of ice wine. = Cryoconcentration = Apples left on the branch through winter The most common method used (close to 95% of ice cider production) to produce ice cider involves harvesting the apples at maturity in autumn, keeping them fresh until they can be pressed in the winter. The resulting juice is then placed in containers outdoors during winter for approximately 6 months. Slowly, the water freezes and the sugar separates, and the must is harvested by gravity as the ice crystals rest on the surface due to their lower density. Certain producers do a second cryoconcentration to increase the initial level of sugar, before fermentation. After that, at the lowest the temperature, the harvested must is fermented in vats for six to seven months before being bottled. This method gives the producer much greater control and involvement over the production process. = Cryoextraction = Frozen apples destined to become ice cider through cryoextractionIn this method, frozen apples are left on the branch until the middle of winter, where they are dried out by the cold, the sun and the wind. They are picked when the temperature is between -8 ¬∞C and -15 ¬∞C, usually after 3 nights at those temperatures. This can require a large amount of labor on short notice and completely determined by the weather, so it is possible to harvest the apples at maturity and leave them outside until the weather is cold enough. This technique is very similar to how Amarone or straw wine is created, and is identical to the production of ice wine. . The process of decantation of the water and the juice therefore happens within the fruit rather than in the juice. The apples are then pressed, frozen more and the resulting nectar is harvested and fermented at a low temperature for around 8 months. This method is more delicate and greatly increases the costs of production because more apples are needed to produce the same amount of cider as traditional methods. It can take 50-100 apples to make one bottle of ice cider. It is also important to note that because this method relies heavily upon the weather cooperating, in some years production is not possible if temperatures do not go low enough. = Other methods = It is also possible to combine the two methods to make ice cider. It takes on average 1.7 kg of apples to create regular cider compared with 9.5 kg of apples to create one litre of ice cider. Definition and requirements Ice cider has several requirements as set by the Artisan cider producers of Quebec. Drinks must be produced by the fermentation of apple juice, which must have a concentration of sugar of 30 ¬∞Bx before fermentation in cold temperatures caused solely by the natural temperature and whose product has a residual sugar content of at least 130 grams per liter. Finally, the alcohol by volume must be more than 7% and less than 13%. In addition, these specifics must be met: # No chaptalization; # No addition of alcohol; # No artificial apple juice or grape must; # Artificial cold of -4 ¬∞C is permitted for malic precipitation; # No additional flavors or coloring; # No concentration of sugars by methods other than natural cold; # No use of concentrated apple juice, regardless of origin, whatsoever; # Organoleptic profile of the product corresponds to that of an ice cider as determined by a trade committee; # The producer of ice cider cultivates the apples; # The pressing, preparation and bottling of ice cider occur at the site of production. The purpose of these regulations are to protect true ice cider from cheaper replicas that do not follow as rigorous a production process. In addition, the government of Quebec has expressed plans to grant a specific appellation for Quebec Ice Cider to distinguish it from ice cider produced using the same methods but outside of Quebec.  Characteristics  Ice cider is typically served as an ap√©ritif before a meal or along with a cheese plate or dessert after a meal. Its higher alcohol content and more expensive production process lead to it typically being sold in 375mL bottles (half the size of a typical wine bottle), but 200mL bottles are growing in popularity. It is described as being \\"rich in apple flavors\\" but the taste can vary greatly depending on the origin of the cider and the method of production used. Cryoextraction in particular, being the more expensive of the two produces a cider with a more complex flavor, including \\"caramel and spice notes\\" among others.

Originally called The Fourth Form at St Percy's, it was a comedy set in a school classroom. The program ran for 520 episodes and was written, produced and directed by Rex Dawe. Yes, What was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry in 2013.National Film and Sound Archive: Sounds of Australia. History Yes, What? began its life as The Fourth Form at St Percy's. It was based on the radio serial The Fourth Form at St Michael's by Will Hay, which aired in the 1920s. Rex Dawe, a young Adelaide broadcaster, wrote the program after having the concept pitched to him by Rex Heading. 5AD program manager Morrie Chapman granted a fifty shillings budget for the show as well as an additional ten shillings for the writer / producer. The cast were mostly chosen from a youth production group The Kangaroo Club. Fifteen- year-old Ralph Peterson was hired to play the larrikin Bottomly and is often described as being a classroom rebel himself. The character Greenbottle, a disruptive student who usually arrived late with some implausible excuse, was voiced by Jack Craig-Gardiner, born in 1915 so only a few years Dawe's junior. The youngest member of the class, Jim Williams, played Standforth, beginning when he was 14. Dawe cast himself as the school-master Dr Pym. Other characters, such as Mr Snootles, played by Frank McCarron, were introduced as the show's popularity increased. The name was changed to Yes, What? after studio executives decided the old title was too long and something more catchy was needed. Richard Harding-Browne first appeared in the show as a barrister in episode 49 and was later given his own character, Francis Marmaduke Algernon de Pledge\\" (aka \\"Pickles\\"). In March 1940 Gardiner had health problems which prevented him from playing Greenbottle, so that character temporarily left the show in episode 342, on the pretext of attending university and de Pledge arrived in episode 344. Greenbottle returned in episode 394 and the cast of four pupils continued until episode 437, when de Pledge left the show, as Harding-Browne had enlisted in the RAAF. The show first aired on 23 June, 1936 at 9:15 pm. The show's timeslot was occasionally altered but for the most part it was given air twice per week, on Tuesday and Thursday nights. There were 520 episodes produced, the first 50 or so went live to air without being recorded. A total of 130 hours were broadcast before the show ended in 1941, two years after the outbreak of the Second World War. However, the show was rerun countless times even outside of Australia, with New Zealand and South Africa both popular audiences. Episodes 209 to 520 were the most commonly broadcast as earlier episodes were not as fast-paced nor regarded as favourably. For instance, the character Greenbottle initially resembled an old man rather than the falsetto miscreant audiences were more familiar with. Dawe later attempted to revive the character of Dr Pym in the series Dr Pym's Progress but this was a critical and commercial failure. Episode format Each episode typically covers an entire school lesson, despite being only about 12 minutes long. Themes often continue through a series of lessons in subsequent episodes. The students try to disrupt or confuse Dr Pym through distractions, unrelated questions and personal stories. The lessons were sometimes set outside the classroom, such as when the class went on an excursion. Each episode was recorded onto a 15-minute disc, so the length was crucial as space had to be left for a sponsor's message before and after the broadcast. The quick rhythm of the program led many to believe that the heavily scripted episodes were ad-lib. The characters spoke fairly quickly for a radio piece, which added to the realism of the broadcasts. The use of special effects was limited and most sounds, such as the bell, the door and the stick were performed by the cast members during the recording. Typically, the line \\"Good morning boys\\" by Dr Pym followed by the boys chorusing \\"Good morning, Sir!\\" was said at the start and end of each episode, with Dr Pym speaking crisply and the boys' reply drawn out (\\"Gooooood morning, Sir!\\"). Final episode, 520 In the final episode, Bottomly places a \\"For Sale\\" sign outside the classroom while Dr Pym and Mr Snootles share a lottery ticket. When a man offers Dr Pym money, he mistakes the man for a lottery representative, only to find he has sold the school. As a result, Bottomly recommends that Dr Pym retires. Main characters =Dr Percival Archibald Pym= The schoolmaster who tirelessly attempts to control his class while mayhem breaks out, Dr Percival Pym is forced to employ his cane to keep his pupils in line. His pupils, particularly Bottomly, jocularly refer to him as \\"Percy\\". He is fairly gullible, allowing the boys to frequently trick him into dismissing them from class as well as a con-man to relieve him of a large sum of money in episode 227. Pym is easily side-tracked by the boys and so often loses his temper. He will generally persist with a subject with little success over several lessons before abandoning it to try a new topic in the hopes that his pupils will eventually learn something. He is known to be overweight and he is often insecure about his inadequacy as a teacher. A recurring gag is Dr Pym's (often unintentional) rudeness to policemen, Mr Snootles, and other guests to the classroom, usually due to being confused or upset by his students. In response to continual usage of the word \\"yes\\" by Greenbottle and Mr Snootles (even when they mean no), Dr Pym asks, \\"Yes, what?\\", from which the show derives its name. Pym was portrayed by Rex \\"Waca\\" Dawe. =Rupert Bottomly= Bottomly is the class clown who uses his time in between classes to plan means of disrupting the next class. Despite proving himself capable of the workload more than a few times he nonetheless gives deliberately silly answers to questions Dr Pym asks. He makes continual quips and appears to have little fear of the cane. This is probably due to Bottomly having had the stick too many times for it to be adequate punishment and he considers many of his jokes worth the pain he will receive. Bottomly takes charge of lessons with his cheekiness quite often and is essentially the ringleader of the group of boys. He is quite happy to allow Greenbottle to be centre of attention, though, to waste more time than he could on his own. While he is not very intelligent in the traditional sense, he is very crafty; he cheats whenever he can in the tests and examinations Dr Pym gives him and such cheating usually goes unnoticed until the end of the episode. He has also contributed to the destruction of the school on two occasions, once by burning it down in a fireworks explosion. The second time, he inadvertently destroyed the classroom by switching chemical bottle labels, which Dr Pym proceeded to mix, causing an explosion that destroyed the classroom. Bottomly was played by Ralph Peterson. =Ronald George Standforth= Standforth is (until De Pledge's arrival at least) the only member of the class keen on learning although he is handicapped by his lack of brains. Due to lacking understanding of more or less anything Dr Pym says, he asks questions that are either so simple Dr Pym scolds his stupidity, or so irrelevant to the topic he leaves his teacher horribly confused. Just after having had information painstakingly explained to the class, Standforth often asks, \\"Why, Sir?\\" or \\"How do you mean, Sir?\\" to Dr Pym. Questions such as these cause Dr Pym to lose his temper; he continuously mocks Standforth's dull intellect and canes him. As a result of this sort of humour, Standforth generally has the fewest lines of any of the regular cast. Standforth shares a rocky relationship with Bottomly who makes fun of his intellect but the two appear to get along most of the time. While in the show for the comedic effect of his ignorance, his only deliberate attempt at humour comes in episode 500 and it is poorly received by his classmates. He was portrayed by Jim Williams, the youngest member of the cast. =Cuthbert Horace Greenbottle Jr= Greenbottle is a member of a large family who all appear to be suffering from madness. His frequent meetings with them invariably make him late for class. He explains ludicrous tales by way of an excuse for his tardiness, often involving his family members or descriptions of his ludicrously designed house. He considers himself an expert on all topics, boasting that whatever subject the class is studying at the time is his best. He often claims to possess skills he really lacks, such as a brilliant singing voice and an expertise in poetry. This does not deter him from demonstrating his self-proclaimed talents. The extent of Greenbottle's lunacy is ambiguous as it is unclear how many of his eccentric habits are feigned to waste time and how many are inherent to his personality. His habit of saying \\"Yes\\" all the time causes Dr Pym to answer \\"Yes, What?\\", to which Greenbottle will often expound ridiculous theories or family stories. Greenbottle was played by Jack Craig-Gardiner although he left the cast for a brief period due to illness. Craig-Gardiner contributed many other minor voices to the series. For example, Greenbottle Senior and the boxer 'Dangerous Dynamite Dixon' from Episode 228. =Francis Marmaduke Algenon de Pledge= De Pledge is, compared to his classmates, a genius. Posh and formal, he is the only member of the class who does not give Dr Pym any headaches. He was introduced into the show following Greenbottle's brief exit but remained in the cast after his return up until his voice, Richard Harding-Browne, joined the air force. De Pledge is able to answer almost any question given to him although given how little work the fourth form manages to complete this is not saying much. Despite being the teacher's pet, he occasionally annoys Dr Pym with his pompous manner and his hastiness to answer questions not directed at him. He resists taking part in Bottomly's schemes but is occasionally tricked into contributing anyway. He is nicknamed \\"Pickles\\" after Bottomly decides his full name is too difficult to remember. Recurring guest characters =Mr Basil Cornelius Snootles= Mr Snootles first appears in episode 75 as a photographer attempting to take a snap of the class. His full name is Basil Cornelius Snootles. His unusual quavering voice leads to much mirth among the class. He re-appears in episodes 103 and 104 and is subsequently hired as the school caretaker. He is an avid bird lover and tries to give the boys a lesson on \\"bird-life, its meaning and importance\\" after being elevated to assistant school-master. He is prone to singing while he works which annoys Dr Pym. He continually pesters Dr Pym about his wages as it appears he doesn't receive any. His appearances in the class-room lead the boys, particularly Bottomly and Greenbottle, to imitate his voice. Mr Snootles is often a victim of Dr Pym's bullying, both intentional and accidental, and the strained relationship between the two is used as a frequent subject of humour. Like Greenbottle, Mr Snootles says the word \\"Yes\\" often, prompting Dr Pym to say, \\"Yes, what?\\" He was played by Frank McCarron who also provided a number of minor voices for the series. =Daphne= Daphne is Bottomly's \\"sweet-heart\\" and occasional assistant to his plots to disrupt the lesson. She is quite taken by Bottomly although he is very embarrassed about it and tries to save face whenever she turns up around his friends. She is forbidden from entering the school-grounds by Dr Pym in an effort to prevent her distracting the class but this does little to prevent her appearances. It has been suggested that Alice Creed, who portrayed her, was the real-life fancy of Ralph Peterson (Bottomly) but in a 1961 radio interview, Peterson made no mention of this and added \\"[I] very stupidly have forgotten\\" who played her. Commercial releases Grace Gibson Productions commenced releasing the series in correct chronological order in December 2013, with Volumes 1 and 2 being released through their online retail store. Each volume contains 20 episodes in mp3 format on CD.

It was released in March 1996. Although the song \\"Incarnate\\" was a moderate hit, this album was the least popular of the band's studio albums. The band made three videos (\\"Incarnate\\", \\"Shut Up\\", and \\"Zoom\\") which all saw play on MuchMusic, but the extra promotion was not enough to boost the success of the album. This is considered to be the only studio album by the band not to be certified at least Gold in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. This was seen as a major disappointment as this album followed the band's most commercially successful release (In The Trees). The band has noted that they went into the recording studio less prepared than before. This allowed more studio experimentation than previous releases including more strings, harp, piano, trumpet, viola, violin and cello. Because the tracks were shaped in the studio, most of the album was not designed specifically to be played live. This proved to be a challenge for a band noted for their live shows. The album provided the band with their second Juno nomination as they were nominated for North Star Rock Album of the Year at the 1997 Juno Awards. As was the case with their first Juno nomination, the band lost the award to their MCA Records labelmates, The Tragically Hip.

Synopsis In 1995, Rifkin contended that worldwide unemployment would increase as information technology eliminated tens of millions of jobs in the manufacturing, agricultural and service sectors. He predicted devastating impact of automation on blue-collar, retail and wholesale employees. While a small elite of corporate managers and knowledge workers would reap the benefits of the high-tech world economy, the American middle class would continue to shrink and the workplace become ever more stressful. As the market economy and public sector decline, Rifkin predicted the growth of a third sector--voluntary and community-based service organizations--that would create new jobs with government support to rebuild decaying neighborhoods and provide social services. To finance this enterprise, he advocated scaling down the military budget, enacting a value added tax on nonessential goods and services and redirecting federal and state funds to provide a \\"social wage\\" in lieu of welfare payments to third-sector workers. Critical reception A number of economists and sociologists have been critical of Jeremy Rifkin for being one of the major contributors to the \\"end of work\\" discourse and literature of the 1990s. Autonomist political philosopher George Caffentzis concluded that Rifkin's argument is flawed because it is based on a technological determinism that does not take into account the dynamics of employment and technological change in the capitalist era.Caffentzis (1998) It is also argued that Rifkin's historical analysis of technological unemployment in the agriculture sector in the southern United States was not shared by Martin Luther King Jr., who believed the problem was the lack of labor rights.ML King, Speech to the Fourth Constitutional Convention AFL-CIO, Miami, Florida (11 December 1961). See E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) SSRN, part 2(2), 13 More recent research suggests that the widespread adoption of computers between the late 1970s and the 1990s increased employment.J Bessen, ‚ÄòHow Computer Automation Affects Occupations: Technology, jobs, and skills‚Äô (2016) Boston University, Law & Economics WP No. 15-49 A major theme of The End of Work is that productivity would lead to the destruction of jobs; however, the book appeared when productivity growth had been in a slowdown since the early 1970s as production costs soared while the widespread use of computers in the 1980s and early 1990s did neither reduce costs or improve productivity as it was expected (this phenomenon would be referred to as the productivity paradox). Strong productivity growth finally appeared in the late 1990s as globalization opened up new markets, but then slowed down again by the second half of the 2000s as costs rose dramatically. The productivity slowdown is still being debated.The Debate Zone: Has the US passed peak productivity growth?  McKinsey & Company Strong growth but without absorbing large numbers of unemployed people is called a jobless recovery. Historically, innovation that obsoletes existing jobs and technologies has not created permanent unemployment, but has instead opened jobs in new industries and moved jobs from agriculture to industry and the service sector. This process is known as creative destruction.

The album contained numerous hits including \\"Stereo\\", \\"Any Day Now\\", and \\"Say Something\\". Videos for \\"Stereo\\" and \\"Any Day Now\\" saw heavy play on MuchMusic in 1998, but by the time the video for \\"Brighter Hell\\" was released in 1999, the momentum had slowed and this video was seen infrequently. The album was certified Gold in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association on July 30, 1998. Background While their previous three albums were released by MCA Records, this was the first release from the band by EMI Music Canada. In 1995, Seagram Company Ltd. acquired 80% of MCA and the following year the new owners dropped the MCA name; the company became Universal Studios, Inc. and its music division, MCA Music Entertainment Group, was renamed Universal Music Group. The biggest change on the CD was the band's embrace of the internet. The CD included a CD-activated key to access multi-media material in a secret area of the band's website. The CD activated website was the first use of this technology for a major-label band. This gave the band three websites: their old website done in a traditional fashion, a new site dedicated to their new record Silent Radar, and a main site which included WAG, the band's official \\"magazine.\\" At the time, their webzine WAG set the band apart from their contemporaries. The webzine was filled with writing from the various band members and included digital photos taken by the band, tour diaries, feature articles, and a summary of the band's reviews of concerts, books, records and gear. The goal of the band in this internet endeavor was to allow them to give people a little taste of who they were when not on stage and what they think about. The release of the album was also unique for its time. They unveiled the album one piece at a time over the internet. Starting Thursday March 5, 1998, a piece of the artwork from the new album was posted on a special website, along with a snippet of one song from the album. Between March 5, 1998 and March 27, 1998, a new piece and a new song was posted every other day until the puzzle was descrambled, and fans had seen and heard bits of the whole track listing. The first song to be put up on the site was the first single \\"Stereo\\", and the snippets were only up for a two-day period before it was replaced by the next song. Following the Canadian release on March 31, 1998, the official album release party came as a live show by the band which was broadcast over the Internet on Thursday April 2, 1998. The webcast was a live show from Lee's Palace in Toronto. Included with the initial release of the CD was a white card which contained \\"CD Active\\" Instructions to the album's secret website. Attached to this card was a coupon which could be mailed back to the band and the sender would receive a free live EP in the mail called Live Radar. Only those who sent back the card received the bonus CD. The album provided the band with their third and final Juno nomination as they were nominated for Best Rock Album at the 1999 Juno Awards. As was the case with their previous two Juno nominations, the band lost the award to The Tragically Hip. (The band's next studio record, Slomotion, was not eligible for a Juno nomination as it contained a \\"greatest hits\\" bonus disc and thus did not meet the Juno requirement that a majority of the material on the album be previously unreleased.)

Volcan Tocorpuri is constructed by andesitic lava flows with some pyroclastics, which form a high pile with a wide summit crater. After this edifice was built, several vents developed on its northwestern flank and south of the summit crater. These vents produced dominantly andesitic lava flows. The southeastern flank of the main Tocorpuri volcano shows evidence of a sector collapse. On its west side lies a rhyolite lava dome called Cerro La Torta. Its steep sides are surrounded with talus and its top surface has flow structures. The complex is located at about 30 km. from the El Tatio geothermal energy field. Volcanism along the Andes occurs in four separate belts, the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. Tocorpuri is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, which in this region is characterized by an ignimbrite formation and individual volcanoes, with compositions ranging from andesite over dacite to rhyolite. Both these formations are emplaced on a Cretaceous- Miocene basement formed by sediments and volcanic rocks, which overlay Precambrian-Paleozoic layers. Aside from stratovolcanoes which are lined up in the Western Cordillera, the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex is also a component of the Central Volcanic Zone and is formed by large calderas and lava domes such as La Torta. Of those units of Tocorpuri that have been sampled, most are andesitic with phenocrysts of amphibole, biotite, pyroxene and quartz. La Torta also has phenocrysts of sanidine and additional apatite and titanite. The main Tocorpuri volcano is partly covered by the Tatio ignimbrite, which is about 800,000 years old. The Torta lava dome was erupted within the last 100,000 years. The Tocorpuri complex has been affected by glaciation during the Pleistocene. The area north of La Torta is also the site of a hydrothermal system at an elevation of which emit calcium sulfate rich water. These hot springs and associated gases are principally low temperature atmospheric systems, with the average temperature not exceeding and a high proportion of atmospheric gases. Presumably, ascending hydrothermal fluids interact with a thick precipitation-fed aquifer before emerging.

Biography  Preisner was born in the eastern town of Mukaƒçevo (presently in Ukraine). In his childhood, he was exposed to a multicultural environment of Czech, Slovak, German, Ukrainian, Hungarian and Jewish communities. He spent his adolescence growing up in Prague under the shadow of the Nazi protectorate. He graduated from high school (receiving his maturita) in 1944, when he was drafted to work in the ƒåeskomoravsk√°-Kolben-Danƒõk factory in Prague, building Panzer tanks. At the end of the war he studied in the German and English Departments of Charles University in Prague, obtaining his doctorate in 1950 with a dissertation on Franz Werfel. For the next year, he taught in the German Department of Charles University, and worked as a literary translator for the Mlad√° fronta and St√°tn√≠ nakladatelstv√≠ kr√°sn√© literature publishing houses. One month after his marriage to the art historian Olga Wittov√° in 1952, Preisner was arrested and sentenced to hard labour in a Stalinist labor camp. He had no idea as to the length of his sentence. \\"It was rumoured that I was to be sent to Siberia,\\" he once said. \\"Only Stalin's death, and the following thaw, averted this fate.\\" His imprisonment lasted from October 1, 1952 to November 28, 1954. Upon his return to Prague, he taught German in the St√°tn√≠ jazykov√° ≈°kola (State Academy of Languages) until 1965. He also worked as a free-lance translator, and lent his hand in attempts at reforming the ƒåeskoslovensk√° strana lidov√° (Czechoslovak People's Party). In 1968, he won the Mlad√° fronta newspaper's literary prize for his Kafkaesque novel Kapil√°ry. That same year, after the Warsaw Pact's squelching of the Prague Spring, he, his wife Olga, and their daughter Ruth left Prague for exile, first in Vienna, and later, from 1969, in the USA. The overwhelmingly positive response in Europe to the German edition of his critical work on Nestroy was the effectual cause of his being offered a professorship at Pennsylvania State University. From 1969 to his retirement in 1992, Preisner was Professor of German literature at Penn State in University Park, Pennsylvania. There, he taught both graduate and undergraduate students, and directed many MA and PhD theses in German, Czech, and Comparative Literature.

Parade controversy In 2006, substantial media coverage of attempts to ban the parade led to several weeks of political and moral debate in local political circles (with the mayor Dick Hubbard condemning the parade and the expo), the public and the media, resulting in the parade drawing several tens of thousands of spectators.

It was operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York until the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, when it became independent. It was founded in 1948 and named for Aloysius Stepinac, the Archbishop of Zagreb in Croatia, which was then part of Yugoslavia. In 1952, Stepinac was appointed a cardinal by Pope Pius XII.  History  Archbishop Stepinac High School opened in 1948 with a capacity of 1,360 students. It began with freshman and sophomore years and reached its full complement in 1950. The school was established subsequent to fundraising by the Catholic parishes of Westchester County, under the leadership of Cardinal Francis Spellman, the Archbishop of New York, and the educational officials of the Archdiocese. The initial purpose of the school was to establish a full educational program with a diversity of subject choices leading to a well- rounded student. In addition to the college preparatory program it offered a general course for boys who wanted to finish their education with high school and enter a trade. Boys were taught by an all-male faculty, almost entirely religious in makeup. In its early years the administration of the school was in the hands of diocesan priests, assisted by religious brothers and an occasional layman. Students from the school were used as extras in the 1972 film Child's Play directed by Sidney Lumet. In many sports, Stepinac has many rival schools that include Iona Prep, Fordham Prep, Holy Cross, St. Francis Prep, Holy Trinity, St. Anthony's, Chaminade, Monsignor Farrell and White Plains High School (the now defunct annual post-season football \\"Turkey Bowl\\" on Thanksgiving Day). Fr. John O'Keefe, president of Archbishop Stepinac from 1992 to 2004, was permanently removed from ministry in 2016 because of allegations of sexual abuse of a minor. O'Keefe's suspension was announced in a December 16, 2015, letter to parishioners from New York's archbishop, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who called the allegation \\"credible.\\"  Demographics  =Race= The high school is 8.5% Asian, 12.5% Black, 14% Hispanic, 60% White and 5% other.  Program  The current administration and faculty of Stepinac is a mix of priests and lay men and women. The high school draws its students predominantly from Westchester County and has evolved into a college preparatory school. The school offers a college prep program, an honors program offering 22 AP classes, and starting in the 2016‚Äì2017 school year, an honors academy designed to give students a head start in their respective field. Stepinac utilizes a library of digital textbooks that can be accessed by students on a variety of devices and is vastly less expensive than buying individual textbooks. Athletics =Football= Stepinac began playing football in 1950 and was one of the initial teams in the Catholic High School Football League when the league was organized in 1954. In 2017, Stepinac was voted as one of the top 15 most dominant New York high school football programs since 2006. The Crusaders have been to five straight CHSFL AAA Championships, winning four of five appearances in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018. Crusaders were the NY State Catholic Champions in 2015, 2017 and 2018. In 2017 Stepinac finished ranked number 5 in the tri-state area, 1 in New York State and 160 in the nation by Max Preps. 2014 In 2014, Stepinac's varsity football team won the AAA Championship in the CHSFL. The school had won lower division championships, but it was the first time the school was League champion since 1955, when it shared the title with Saint Francis Prep.  2015  The 2015 Stepinac Varsity Crusaders went undefeated at 12-0 and won both the Catholic High School Football League (CHSFL) and Catholic High School Athletic Association (CHSAA) Championships to complete an historic season. On November 28, 2015, the Stepinac Crusaders football team defeated the Monsignor Martin Conference champion Saint Francis High School of Buffalo 42‚Äì28 at Grand Island High School to capture their first state championship. The victory marked the end of a 12-game undefeated season.  2016 Stepinac played in the 2016 CHSFL AAA championship game, losing to Cardinal Hayes.  2017  Stepinac won the 2017 Catholic High School Athletic Association (CHSAA) New York State Football Championship.  2018  Stepinac won the 2018 Catholic High School Athletic Association (CHSAA) New York State Football Championship for the second consecutive year by defeating St. Francis of Buffalo. = Basketball = Stepinac's basketball team captured a state championship in 2018.

The album was released as 2-CD set where the second CD was a greatest hits package. This was the band's last studio album. Background After four albums, Sammy Kohn split from the group to work as Canadian promo rep for the Toronto offices of Boston-based roots label, Rounder Records. Musically, he hooked up with John Hornak and Michael Owen from reaulaudiowavetransfer. The new partnership took off instantly and resulted in a new band, the experimental trio Avenue One. The loss of their drummer and original member would alter the band's songwriting and sound. With Kohn gone, the various Watchmen hooked up their Macintosh computers with Pro Tools software and began experimenting with samples, backbeats and tape loops to create a collection of electronic tracks shot through with the band's trademark melodies. This change in direction divided fans and critics. At this time, EMI Music Canada wanted to release a greatest hits package with one or two new songs. The band fought to include all 8 of the new songs they had completed. As a compromise, the new album became a 2-CD set but was priced as a single CD. Disc One, dubbed Fast Forward, is a set of 8 new songs produced by Rhys Fulber (Front Line Assembly & Delerium) and DJ Iain, and also includes a remix of their song \\"Stereo\\" from Silent Radar. The songs feature programmed beats, and synthesizer sounds, a first for the band. Disc Two, dubbed Rewind, includes 9 of the band's best songs, culled from their previous four studio records. In keeping with the band's embrace of multimedia and the internet which began with Silent Radar, both discs contained multimedia components, including photos, video clips, and technology allowing fans to remix the song ‚ÄúSlomotion‚Äù. Both CDs also provided a link to a private website which could only be accessible to those who bought the CD. Reception The album's lead single, \\"Absolutely Anytime\\", was released on August 20, 2001 and was moderately successful. The album was released in the first week of October 2001 and the bargain-priced double-CD set sold 7,908 copies in its first week of release. This placed it at No. 6 on the Canadian Albums Charts. This was an improvement over the first week sales of the band's previous album Silent Radar in April 1998 which sold 4,985 copies in its first week. The album was certified Gold in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association on October 16, 2001. The band made videos for \\"Slomotion\\" and \\"Holiday (Slow It Down)\\" in 2002, both of which saw good rotation on MuchMusic. Tour The band went on an extensive tour to support the new album. Band members Joey Serlin (Guitar, Vocals), Daniel Greaves (Vocals, Harmonica, Piano), and Ken Tizzard (Bass) were joined by Winnipegger Ryan Ahoff on Drums. In addition to playing bass, Tizzard also acted as the group's DJ by working a turntable and other ‚Äúdigital doodads‚Äù. He took up the name OBScene to commemorate his new DJ skills. Throughout the tour, the band continued to use the internet to promote their efforts. For example, the December 20, 2001 concert at the Congress Centre in Ottawa was webcast over the internet. Following the promotion and tour for Slomotion, the band members went off to separate projects. However, as 2002 became 2003, the band members decided the band had run its course. The decision to fold the band came about not because of musical differences or nasty infighting, but because of a bad case of creative stagnation. Following the tour in support of Slomotion, the band members felt that their enthusiasm was more on the other projects and it was forced for The Watchmen, and it wasn't fair for the band or the fans.

Gold is an FBI analyst, and was first introduced in season 7. Concept and creation Garofalo initially turned down the role because of the way the show depicted torture. She later changed her mind, saying in an interview: \\"being unemployed and being flattered that someone wanted to work with me outweighed my stance [on torture].\\" As portrayed, Janis does show her anger and disapproval in incidents where human rights are presumably violated in the fight against terror threats, only to have her beliefs contradicted by the end of the season, as torture saves the day yet again in the final episode. Characterization Gold's offers a counterpoint to Chloe O'Brian. Gold, an FBI analyst, is suspicious of her new office mate O'Brian who is the resident tech-savvy computer analyst. The rivalry between Chloe and Janis is designed to lighten the often-grim, high-pressure thriller with a touch of humor. Garofolo decided that Janis would come from a place \\"where anxiety and irony collide\\" and said that she is \\"very self-aware. Whereas Mary Lynn (Chloe) doesn't quite understand what impact she's having on people.\\" Since the two characters of Gold and O'Brian met in the February 16th episode, they have shared a rivalry over who is the better computer hacker.

It was the second school opened by the Christian Brothers in Auckland. It was named after Archbishop Liston (1881‚Äì1976), the seventh Catholic Bishop of Auckland (1929‚Äì1970). The school was founded in 1974 to serve the Catholic families of West Auckland and to absorb the growing number of boys who travelled daily to St Peter's College in central Auckland.Graeme Donaldson, To All Parts of the Kingdom: Christian Brothers In New Zealand 1876-2001, Christian Brothers New Zealand Province, Christchurch, 2001, p. 17. Roll Liston College has a diverse, multicultural roll. In 2015 its ethnic composition was generally 34% New Zealand European, 9% Maori, 26% Asian and 17% Pacifika. The college excels in sporting and cultural activities. Academically, the school offers for senior years the National Certificate of Educational Achievement assessment system (NCEA). History =Beginnings= Archbishop Liston of Auckland had, for some years, intended to establish a Catholic boys' school in Henderson. At first it was envisioned that it would be staffed by a community of Oblates of Mary Immaculate. But this did not happen and, eventually, the mission was entrusted to the Christian Brothers.Sister Mary Augustine McCarthy, OP, \\"Star in the South: The Centennial History of the New Zealand Dominican Sisters\\", St Dominic's Priory, Dunedin, 1970, p. 300. Liston College was established by Liston's successor, the eighth Catholic Bishop of Auckland, Reginald Delargey (1914‚Äì1979, Auxiliary Bishop of Auckland 1957-1970 and Bishop of Auckland 1970-1974) in February 1974. The College commenced operations on 7 February 1974 using classrooms at Holy Cross School, Henderson, with a staff of two Christian Brothers, Br G J Wellsmore and Br J P McKean and 72 foundation pupils. The pupils were divided into Form One 'J' and Form One 'M'. These initials stood for Archbishop Liston's Christian names - James Michael. Classwork began immediately and homework was set on the first day.\\" \\"Brother Wellsmore supervised the building programme, the establishment of the curriculum and the development of a unique school spirit. The Christian Brothers tradition and values underpinned Br Wellsmore's vision for the school. As the school roll grew and the building programme was completed, the college spirit became embedded in the Liston community.\\"Liston College: 25th Jubilee 1975-2000, p. 1. During 1973 and 1974, the school was erected on the property at Edwards Avenue, which prior to work commencing was \\" ... an open paddock with an old house on it.\\" The buildings, gymnasium and grounds were ready for occupation in the first term of 1975. The school was formally opened in November 1975 by John Mackey, the ninth Catholic Bishop of Auckland (1974‚Äì1983), in the presence of Archbishop Liston (who died the following year, 8 July 1976).Liston College: 25th Jubilee 1975-2000, pp. 4 and 8; Nicholas Reid, James Michael Liston: A Life, Victoria University Press, Wellington, 2006, p. 304. =Development= When Brother R A Sisson became Principal (1980‚Äì1985) the roll had grown to 380 boys and 28 staff including five brothers. The deaths of Deputy Principal Brother Thomas Aquinas Monagle in 1983Brother V. Ives, Brother Monagle 1928-1983, Liston College 25th Jubilee 1975-2000, p. 28 and the head of the Intermediate Mr Hemana in 1984 had a profound effect on the whole school community. =Parental and community support= \\"From its beginning the college had good parental support. A very strong PTFA helped run various activities and it provided the backbone of great fundraising efforts. 'Foremost among these was the Friday night flea market which involved many families. Not only was it profitable but it was a great social event in Henderson. Crowds came along and at its peak $40,000 was made annually for the benefit of the school.' The annual gala was another source of revenue. The funds provided sports equipment, cricket wickets and practice nets, tennis courts, computer room, audiovisual materials and teaching resource material. Many building alterations were funded over the years.\\"Donaldson, pp. 17 and 18; Liston College 25th Jubilee 1975 - 2000, pp. 6 and 7. \\"The College has been well served by Boards of Governors/trustees who have worked to provide the best in education to the students. The board oversaw the completion of the school buildings, gymnasium, grounds and the Religious Education Centre/Sports Pavilion.\\" Liston College was fortunate to receive some considerable gifts in its early years. In 1978, John and Betty Rose donated the engineering workshop to the school. \\"Through their generosity, hundreds of young boys got the opportunity to learn engineering skills - skills that many fine-tuned in later years of life.\\" In 1978, Henry Norcross donated the Liston College main entrance crucifix. Graham and Patricia Glamuzina donated the school chapel in 1979. \\"The chapel erected in the grounds of Liston College stands forever as a tribute to the thoughtfulness and generosity of the Glamuzina family. With the opening of a Catholic boys' college to service West Auckland, Graham and Patricia [Glamuzina] decided that an appropriate addendum to the college would be a separate chapel and so they provided the funding to complete the work. The delightful little chapel with its feature window designed by Colin McCahon will always be a fitting way for us to remember the Glamuzina family.\\"Liston College 25th Jubilee 1975 - 2000, p. 24. =Integration and character change= \\"In 1982 Liston College became an Integrated School and the number of brothers on staff was six.\\"Donaldson, p. 18. That was the largest representation of Christian Brothers in the history of the school. \\"The sole remaining brother by 1985 was the Principal Br Sisson. When Mr Francis (Frank) Huckle replaced him, it marked the last official connection of the Christian Brothers with the school\\". \\"Br Sisson completed his years as Principal in 1985 and the Brothers withdrew at the end of 1988\\" However Brother J D O'Neill taught at Liston College 1991-1994 and he was the last Christian Brother to do so.Robertson, p. 206. The Christian brother connection with Liston College thus lasted for most of the first twenty years of its existence. \\"The first lay-Principal, Mr Huckle led the college from 1986 until his [retirement and subsequent] death in April 1999. This saw a period of consolidation and then growth in terms of enrolments, academic success and sporting achievement and it was a continuation of the self-help spirit, which was at the heart of the College from its foundation. 'Among Mr Huckle's many achievements, one was significant. It was his spiritual leadership of the College and it was consistent and clear during his thirteen years as Principal.'\\".Liston College 25th Jubilee 1975 - 2000, p. 29. \\"Mr Chris Rooney, the current principal, said it was appropriate to remember the contributions of Br Wellsmore, Br Sisson, and Mr Huckle, who shaped the College before him, and he sees it as his task to enhance what they had entrusted to him.\\" Houses The names and colours of the Liston College Houses are: *Cook - Red *Kupe - Yellow *Pompallier - Blue *Tasman - Green The Houses are used for some administrative purposes, such as assigning form classes, but are primarily used for the purpose of holding inter-house competitions in a variety of sports and academic challenges. Winning Houses are allocated points and at the end of the year, the House with the most points wins overall and the leaders of that House receive the \\"House of the Year\\" trophy.

The book has been adapted into a stage play, and filmed as a documentary. Background The Hollow Men is based on a wide range of internal party documents, including emails, which Hager stated were leaked to him by six National Party insiders. The documents and emails were written by then party leader Don Brash, and a wide range of people associated with him. The book was initially prevented from being published when Brash obtained an injunction preventing anyone from publishing material from emails that he had written. At the time he was unaware that Hager had completed the book and was about to launch it.\\"Hager revealed as author of Brash emails book\\". Sunday Star-Times. 21 November 2006 Brash claims that the emails were stolen. However, on 23 November 2006, Brash announced his resignation from the leadership of the National Party. The following day he had the injunction lifted, allowing the book to be released. Political scientist Raymond Miller wrote that, \\"Had he not resigned, he would not have survived the fallout from this book's release.\\"Raymond Miller, \\"Brash would not have survived Hager's revelations\\", Sunday Star-Times, 26 November 2006. Content The book describes Brash's rise to power in the New Zealand National Party as being assisted by an \\"informal network of people from the right of New Zealand politics\\", including a number of ACT members, and alleges the funding of the National Party in the 2005 election was mainly from prominent New Zealand businessmen through blind trusts. It also documents that senior National Party figures, including Brash, knew of the Exclusive Brethren's pamphlet campaigns in May 2005, although Brash denied any knowledge of this until August. The book showed that even Brash's admissions in August 2005 were inaccurate, making his resignation inevitable.\\"The smoking gun\\", Scoop, 24 November 2006. (This page has a copy of a May 2005 email from Ron Hickmott, who co-ordinated the Exclusive Brethren campaign, addressed to Brash and John Key). The heart of the book is its descriptions of the National Party strategy discussions and the techniques the party advisers used to try to win the 2005 national elections. The thinking behind major speeches, media management, election advertising and election messages is shown in the participants' own words. Many of the party's previously anonymous major donors are identified and relations with them are documented. Response from Don Brash Brash responded to the book saying that it was a \\"shoddy work of fiction\\" and a \\"tissue of lies\\". In particular, he denied receiving a crucial e-mail on 25 May 2005 that spelt out Exclusive Brethren election plans and their co- operation with the National Party. He said: \\"I have no record of receiving that email. It is either total fiction or it was sent to one of the three other email addresses which I don't personally receive.\\"Vernon Small, \\"Brash: book tissue of lies\\", Dominion Post, 27 November 2006. Brash stated that as he wasn't aware of the email he had not \\"knowingly misled\\" the public on the matter.Alastair Thompson, \\"Brash responds ‚Äì I didn't read the email either!\\", Scoop, 27 November 2006. However, Hager's book also detailed that, on the same day as the Exclusive Brethren's letter was sent, Brash had sent another email in which he discussed the possibility of other groups funding \\"parallel campaigns\\" that would benefit the National Party. Brash wrote: \\"I guess the stuff which the Brethren is doing is one example\\".Nicky Hager, The Hollow Men, Craig Potton Publishing, 2006, p. 26. This email is cited in Alastair Thompson, \\"Brash responds ‚Äì I didn't read the email either!\\", Scoop, 27 November 2006. Brash wrote a response to the book in December 2006 that claimed to show \\"dozens of factual errors, some of no great significance but others of much greater importance\\". In particular, he identified \\"the allegation that taxpayers' money was used to pay for a pamphlet promoting a fair tax regime for the racing industry; it was not.\\" It was, he wrote, an example of an error caused by \\"having access to only part of an internal discussion.\\"Don Brash, \\"Nicky Hager's book\\", Scoop, 6 December 2006. In response Hager wrote that \\"out of a 350-page book, with nearly 1000 detailed references, Don Brash has found two minor inaccuracies. I am happy to take his word about both of them. But neither detracts from the book.\\"Nicky Hager, \\"Reply to Don Brash\\", Scoop, 7 December 2006. Brash's insistence that the pamphlet had not been paid for with taxpayers funds ignored that it had been prepared by Parliamentary staff, which is also a breach of the parliamentary rules. Police investigation Police investigated the theft of Brash's emails but in May 2009 columnist Fran O'Sullivan described it as a \\"farce\\" as police \\"thumbed their nose\\" at Brash by assigning an inept police officer who made a merely cursory investigation of \\"what was obviously a politically motivated burglary.\\" An internal review of the original investigation was conducted by the New Zealand Police as a result of complaints lodged by Brash. The review concluded that the investigation was competently performed and the results correct, but was critical of some delays in reporting the results of the investigation to Brash. Adaptations In 2007 Dean Parker adapted it into a stage play that was directed by Jonathon Hendry. It was also filmed by Alister Barry as a feature-length documentary that was shown to a sell-out audience at the Wellington Film Festival on 20 July 2008.

It was introduced as a sportier version of the Lambretta Li Series III but cheaper than the Lambretta TV Series III.  History  The Li 150 Special came first in September 1963 and was introduced to help cope with the demand for faster scooters, while staying as a 150cc, by having a new barrel, head and reworked gearbox. The Li 150 Special was marketed as the 'Pacemaker' by in the United Kingdom by Lambretta Concessionaires. In October 1965 The Li 125 Special began production, mainly aimed at a younger market the 125 Special had similar improvements to on the standard Li as its 150 alternative with a reworked barrel head and gearbox, but also having a larger 20mm carburettor. In 1965 after 2 years of production Lambretta released the Sliver and Golden Special.  Design  = Li Special = Li 125 Special showing Octagonal Headlamp in Metallic Blue paint The Li Special was designed to fill the gap in the market between the Li Series III and TV Series III and was given revised styling like the reworked TV Series III. The Li Special changed its headset to the Octagonal style as well as having a more squared-off front mudguard, slimmer and lower horn casting and the new side panels with front and rear 'finger flashes'. Later models removed the chrome ring between the handle bars and leg-shield.  Colour Schemes  125 Specials came in Metallic Blue 8061 and White Thorn 8082, in later examples. The 150 Special came in White, Green, Red and Blue. All internal bodywork parts were painted in New White 8059. The Silver Special came in Metallic Grey 8060 and the Golden Special came in Light Metallic Gold 8063.  Tuning Improvements  The 150 Special was introduced in 1963 as a sportier alternative to the standard Li 150. The compression ratio was increased from 7:1 to 7.5:1 giving the special over the standard 150's . The introduction of the 125 Special brought with it a further compression ratio increase up to 8:1 producing over the of the standard Li 125. The 125 Special along with the SX150 and SX200 featured a larger 20 mm Dell'Orto carburettor over the 18 mm carburetor found on the 150 Special. Although the 150 Special had a higher top speed the tuning improvements along with a new gearbox, which would later wind up in the DL/GP range of scooters, gave the 125 Special an advantage in acceleration.

The west end of the airfield had originally been operated by RAF Transport Command, during the Second World War. Following the War, all RAF forces in Bermuda were withdrawn, but the RAF commander, Wing Commander Mo Ware, remained, on loan to the local government, and oversaw the conversion of the RAF facilities into a Civil Air Terminal (the rest of the airfield, Kindley Field, was, at that time, operated by the US Army Air Forces). By 1945, flying boats were rapidly being replaced as airliners by landplanes, and civil airlines began using the US Army's runway to access the Bermuda Government's terminal. In 1948, the US Army Air Forces became the independent US Air Force, the airbase became Kindley Air Force Base, and the civil flying boat airport on Darrell's Island closed completely. In 1970, the airfield was transferred to the US Navy. When the US Navy withdrew from Bermuda in 1995, operation of the entire airfield was handed over to the Bermuda Government, and it was renamed the Bermuda International Airport (with the Civil Air Terminal no longer distinguished within it). Airport policing prior to 1995 As a US Naval Air Station, policing of most of the airfield had been a US Naval responsibility, carried out by US NAS Bermuda Police, and by US Navy Security Detachments (for a time, there had also been a US Marine Corps detachment). The area used by the Bermuda Government, comprising the Civil Air Terminal, and what are now labelled Aprons One and Two, with that part of the taxiways and former runway (currently Taxiway Bravo) which lay between, were policed by the Bermuda Police Service (BPS). The Bermuda Police Service maintained a small station in the Civil Air Terminal, controlled the access points to airside used by workers and vehicles, drove vehicle patrols, and kept watch on the tarmac (with no jetways, passengers at the airport are able to mingle with apron workers). The Bermuda Police Service was responsible for all policing duties on the airside of the Civil Air Terminal, including arresting and removing passengers from aircraft, and responding to emergencies. The Airport Police Station had no jail facilities, but also served to hold people detained by other agencies (Bermuda Immigration, HM Customs, US Customs, Immigration and Agriculture) 'til they could be transferred to the St. George's Police Station. The duties facing the service at the airport were considered unarduous, and it was long used as the first posting for newly-trained constables. Creation of the Airport Security Police An AS Policeman In 1995, with the withdrawal of the US Navy, the Bermuda government took on responsibility for policing the entire airfield. Unfortunately, Bermuda was still feeling the effects of the recession of the early 1990s, and this had led to a reduction in the manpower of the Bermuda Police Service. At the same time, the new Police Commissioner, Colin Coxall , was determined to modernise the Bermuda Police Service by returning it to its roots . It was felt that the service had lost familiarity with the community it was policing, with constables waiting in police stations to react to situations, rather than walking the beat, anticipating, and preventing them. As the Bermuda Police Service attempted to redirect its efforts to more traditional 'community policing', which required a greater manpower, it found itself short of constabulary. Many non-policing roles within the service were reassigned to civilians in order to place more police officers on the street, but it was ultimately decided to withdraw the detachment from the airport in order to make-up the shortfall elsewhere. The Bermuda Government was still responsible for the policing of the airfield, which responsibility fell to the Ministry of Transport's (MOT) Department of Air Operations (DAO). Rather than organise a new police force itself, the DAO contracted a private company (Island Wide Security Services ‚Äì now Bermuda Security Group) to organise, recruit, train, and operate the force on its behalf. Recruiting was primarily of ex-service personnel. This included former members of the Bermuda Police Service, the Bermuda Reserve Constabulary, The Bermuda Regiment (which trains in Internal security as a potential back-up to the civil police), the Royal Navy and Royal Marines. Former US Naval personnel resident in Bermuda have also been recruited. The new Airport Security Police took over all airside duties from the Bermuda Police Service (and the US Naval Security Detachments) in 1995. Those parts of the US Naval Base not necessary for the operation of the airfield were fenced off, and were guarded, til the area was redeveloped, by Baselands Security, security guards (who lacked police powers) recruited and controlled by the Bermuda Police Service. Organisation of the Airport Security Police The unit has a strength of about twenty, under the control of a uniformed manager, a former senior officer of the Bermuda Police Service. The Bermuda Police Service vets recruits, who are trained with the assistance of the Bermuda Police Training School. The Airport Security Police operates under the instruction of the DAO's Aviation Security Officer. Its powers, including its powers of arrest, are all drawn from the Air Transport Act. As a British Overseas Territory, security of the airfield, and of aviation in Bermuda, is ultimately the responsibility of the UK Government. The National Aviation Security Plan (NASP) of the UK Government's Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR) (now the Department for Transport (DfT)), also determined the content of the Bermudian NASP, which describes the roles, responsibilities and procedures relating to security of the Bermuda International Airport. Consequently, the ASP also act under the oversight of the UK Department for Transport's (DfT) Regional Aviation Security Officer, responsible for Bermuda and for other British Overseas Territories in the Atlantic and the West Indies, based in the United States. Additionally, as the airspace around Bermuda has, by an agreement between the UK and US Governments, been placed under US control, the duties of the Airport Security Police are also shaped by activities in the US.

The building was originally conceived by the Reading Company while in a state of bankruptcy as a way to capitalize on its real estate holdings in Center City. Reading was granted development rights for the building along with a large parking complex in exchange for granting the city easements for developing the Jefferson Station (then Market East Station) entrance in the ground floor of the adjacent Reading Terminal.O'Neil, David K., Reading Terminal Market: an Illustrated History, p27, Camino Books Inc. Philadelphia, 2004. Construction soon began and the building was completed in 1984. The building was designed by Bower Lewis Thrower (BLT) Architects of Philadelphia. In 2018, Aramark vacated the building when the company relocated its headquarters to 2400 Market Street. In its place, Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health became the primary tenant.

It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 women are legally employed as prostitutes and approximately 20,000 women, half of whom are if foreign origin and the other half are Greek, are engaged in illegal prostitution. Many women affected by the economic crisis have turned to prostitution through poverty. Legal situation People engaged in prostitution may only work in state-run brothels (called studios). The women must be over 18; unmarried; have the right to live and work in Greece; be free from STIs; not suffer from mental illness; not have a drug addiction; and not have been convicted of homicide, pimping, child porn, trafficking, robbery or blackmail. They must register at the local prefecture and carry a medical card that is updated every two weeks. Sex is completely allowed from prostitutes and is a good source of revenue for Greece. Greek authorities decided to implement a 1999 law which stipulates that all brothels must have permits. Permits are issued by the state, usually to older women. Many of these women are former prostitutes. Brothels must be at least 200m from public buildings. It was proposed this should be reduced to 100m ahead of the 2004 Athens Olympics but the Greek government did not act on the proposal. Solicitation is illegal, but common, and the number of street prostitutes is increasing. Pimping and procuring are illegal. HIV Between 2011 and 2015, HIV infections increased 200% in Greece. In April 2012, after the HIV rate had increased 60% in one year, the authorities in Athens arrested many drug addicts and prostitutes; and conducting compulsorily testing for HIV on these individuals. The media were complicit in the crack-down and published names and photographs of those who were HIV positive. This action made sex workers wary of getting tested in case their names were published if they tested positive. Condom use between sex workers and clients is low (estimated to be 4.7% by UNAIDS). This increases the risk of HIV and other STIs being transmitted. Sex trafficking Greece is a destination, transit, and, to a very limited extent, source country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking.Traffickers subject some women and children from Eastern and Southern Europe, South and Central Asia, China, Georgia, Nigeria, and Russia to sex trafficking in unlicensed brothels, on the street, in strip clubs, in massage salons, and in hotels. The increase in unaccompanied child migrants in Greece has increased the number of children susceptible to exploitation. Some public officials have been investigated for suspected involvement in human trafficking. Law 3064/2002 and Presidential Decree 233/2003 prohibit both sex trafficking and forced labour and prescribe punishments of up to 10 years imprisonment. Police investigated 18 sex trafficking cases in 2015 (26 in 2015). The government prosecuted 25 defendants for sex trafficking in 2016 (97 in 2015). The government has increased victim protection efforts. Police identified 26 sex trafficking victims, including five children, compared to 34 in 2015. During 2016, Greece continued to experience a wave of migration from the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, consisting of a mix of asylum- seekers, potential refugees, economic migrants, and populations vulnerable to trafficking, among others. One international organisation estimated Greece received more than 170,000 migrants and asylum-seekers in 2016; some of these individuals, such as unaccompanied children and single women, are highly vulnerable to trafficking. Unaccompanied children, primarily from Afghanistan, engage in survival sex and are vulnerable to trafficking. Recruiters target migrants in refugee camps from their own countries. Most migrants and asylum- seekers are believed to rely on smugglers at some point during their journey and in some instances are forced into exploitation upon arrival in Greece. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Greece as a 'Tier 2' country.
