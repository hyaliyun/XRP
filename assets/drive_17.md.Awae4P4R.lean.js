It was planted with various fruit and nut trees by the Department of Agriculture and, in 1952, a small area was planted with Radiata Pines. In 1968, management was transferred to the Woods and Forest Department and, in 1972, the remaining fruit trees were removed and more pines were planted. However, by 1985, after community opposition to a plan to harvest the timber, the land was resumed and held as vacant Crown Land. After further opposition to attempts to dispose of the land, led by the community based Save the Blackwood Forest Committee, it was proclaimed a recreation park in November 2001.

In 1768 she married a Polish noble, General Jan Jerzy Grabowski (died 1789). Some of the children of this marriage are thought to have actually been children of the last Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth king, Stanisław August Poniatowski. In 1789, she became a widow and possibly entered into a secret, morganatic marriage with the King,http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/64004,,,,grabowska_elzbieta,haslo.html remaining known at court as his maîtresse-en-titre. However, Wirydianna Fiszerowa, a contemporary who knew her, reported that tales of this marriage only circulated after Poniatowski's death, and were spread about by Elżbieta herself, but were not generally believed. She was thought to have exercised some influence on the king during his reign perceived as negative, which made her unpopular. In 1795, King Stanisław abdicated following the Third Partition of Poland, and lived in Grodno under Russian watch until, in 1796, Paul I of Russia invited him to Saint Petersburg. Elżbieta, with her two sons, Stanisław and Michał, took the king to Saint Petersburg to care for him there, and she lived with him until his sudden death in 1798. Afterwards, she returned to Warsaw, then under Prussian rule following the Partitions, where she became a patroness of the Tableau vivant there. She died in Warsaw on 1 June 1810, survived by four of her children. She had three sons and two daughters with the king, and their second son, Michał Grabowski, distinguished himself in combat, eventually becoming a general in the army of the Duchy of Warsaw.

The Tashkent University of Information Technologies was founded as the Tashkent Electro Technical Institute of Communication in 1955 and it was the major and only producer of communication engineers for the Central Asian region. Today, it is one of the major universities to nurture ICT talent in Uzbekistan. The university was named after Al-Khwarizmi by a presidential resolution to further boost its role within the nation and abroad. Tashkent University of Information Technologies named after Muhammad al-Khwarizmi. History At the beginning, the institute was situated on the territory of the Tashkent Communication Polytechnic founded in 1930 (nowadays the Tashkent Vocational College of Communication) and was functioning there until the beginning of the academic year 1961–1962. The duties of the head (rector) of the institute were temporarily entrusted to N. B. Matskevich, chief of the Technical School of Communication. In the first academic year, 150 students were admitted to the University only on one specialization: telephone and telegraph communication. So the telephone and telegraph communication (TTC) faculty and four united departments were established. The first graduation of engineers took place in 1960. In the academic year of 1957–58 the radio and broadcasting faculty (RBF) was opened and the institute began training radio and broadcasting engineers. In 1957 general-technical departments were established to train students in such specializations as telephony, telegraphy, communication lines, telecommunication, and power supply of communication enterprises. Since 1960 such departments as theoretical fundamentals of radio engineering; radio receivers; radio transmitters; broadcasting and television and some others were established. Since the academic year of 1964–65 on the base of TTC faculty the institute began to train students in two specializations: automatic telecommunication and multi-channel telecommunication. The TTC faculty was renamed the Automatic and Multi-Channel Telecommunication faculty (AMCTCF). In academic year 1969–1970 two independent faculties – Automatic Telecommunication (ATC) and Multi-Channel Telecommunication (MCTC) – were established. Since academic year 1964–65 some existing departments were reorganized or new ones established: the theory of linear electric network; the theory of signal transmission and the theory of nonlinear electric network; technical electrodynamics and antenna-feeder devices; measurements in communication engineering; automatic telecommunication; multi-channel telecommunication; transmission of discrete messages and telegraphy, etc. In 1957, the institute opened night and correspondence departments with the following specializations: telephone and telegraph communication; radio and broadcasting. Since 1968 the institute has been paying particular attention to training working students — they introduced a new position of pro-rector for the night and correspondence departments. Towards the end of the 1960s, the admittance of students to the daytime department was 400–450 persons; to the night and correspondence departments was 300 persons. Toward the second half of the 1970s, the number of daytime students came to 2000–2500 persons and night and correspondence students came to about 2000. Since the end of the 1950s, some special departments began scientific researches on the basis of economic contracts. For example, the communication lines department made research to determine the specific electro-conductivity of the ground in Central Asia, the department of theoretical fundamentals of radio engineering investigated magnetostrictive sifters. The first research laboratories with independent staff of research officers were established at that time. In the 1970s the institute reached the level of training engineers with education quality, which wasn't inferior to other graduates of the same institutes established earlier. The institute became one of the prestigious educational institutions of the Republic with rather big scientific potential and a large number of lecturers with academic status and degrees. At that time the institute began to carry out big state budget and contract researches on developing new means of communication and new ways of signal transmitting, receiving and handling. At the same time the institute researched other adjacent spheres of national economy. In 1991 the university opened a post- graduate course on two specialties and a special academic council on defending PhD theses started. Nowadays this post-graduate course prepares highly qualified specialists in five professions. Since 1993 a special military faculty has been functioning at the university. This faculty prepares communication officers mainly for troops of the Ministry of Defense and other power structures of the Republic Uzbekistan. Since 1996 the Central Asian Telecommunication Training Center for raising the level of engineers' skills has been functioning at the University. This Center uses the grant TASIS TEMPUS under the program of the European Union Commission. About 100 lecturers and post-graduates raised the level of their skills in training centers of Belgium and Greece under this program. At the University there is also a Center for training women in information and telecommunication technologies established by the Trade and Development Agency and, besides that, there are courses under the CISCO program (US). All the preparations are being made to organize the joint Uzbek–Indian Training Center of Information Technologies. The University has established close friendly and business relationships with many relative higher education institutions of the world. Two lyceums are functioning under the patronage of the University: Boarding School Lyceum and Academic Lyceum, each of them trains about 200,250 students. The classrooms of the lyceums are equipped with sufficient computers, including computers connected to the Internet. The library fund of the university has over 300,000 books and it is constantly increasing and renovating. There is also an electronic library connected to the local network of the university and to the Internet. The university has a house of students for 700 persons, which has all necessary conditions for living, relaxation and sports. According to the president's decree dated 30 May 2002, the Tashkent Electro Technical Institute of Communication was reorganized into the Tashkent University of Information Technologies. The teaching staff got the instruction to fulfill their duties more properly and raise the level of education of Bachelors and Masters in information and computer technologies including information security and electronic commerce. The Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministry of the Republic dated 2 June 2005 \\"About development of the staff training system in the sphere of information technologies\\" determined the Tashkent University of Information Technologies as the main educational institution preparing specialists in the sphere of information and communication technologies. There has been made a decision to open regional branches of the University in Nukus, Karshi, Samarkand, Fergana and Urgench.

He was the subject of a TV documentary and a best-selling book by his son, translated into 13 languages; both entitled The Mascot. According to the story, Alex Kurzem is the former boy mascot (hence the book title) of a Latvian police Schutzmannschaft Battalion 18, who witnessed the massacre of his Jewish mother as a five-year-old boy and subsequently emigrated to Australia. Kurzem maintained that he is a Holocaust survivor from Belarus. However the authenticity of his account was challenged in 2009 by Dr Barry Resnick among others. When put under further scrutiny by the Jewish-American scholars, and asked to prove his survivor's tale by taking a DNA test, Kurzem refused. He also dismissed out of hand the archival records of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University as allegedly falsified; but eventually admitted: \\"I might be anybody, but I have got no proof who I am.\\"Herald Sun, \\"Holocaust survivor's tale under scrutiny.\\" Australia. Autobiography Kurzem claimed he pieced together his autobiography from bits of memories substantiated with the help of his son by documents and evidence discovered while in search of his forgotten identity. He concluded that he was Ilya or Ellyeh the Yiddish pronunciation of Elija, and that his parents were Solomon Galperin (in Hassidic Yiddish pronounced Shloimeh Halpern) and Chana Gildenberg (the Hassidic Yiddish pronunciation of Goldenberg), who were Jewish. On October 21, 1941, Gildenberg and her son Duvid and daughter were murdered along with approximately 1,600 other Jews in Koidanova (now Dzyarzhynsk, Belarus). Solomon Galperin escaped extermination and joined a group of Soviet partisans. He was later caught and sent to Auschwitz, returning to Dzyarzhynsk after the war. He remarried, and, according to his newly born son, died in 1975 without ever knowing that his eldest son had survived.All according to Mark Kurzem's book The Mascot, some reiterated in several televised interviews. Kurzem said that he escaped, while seeing the mass murder and that after months of living in the forest he was captured and taken to a site were Jews were being assassinated. He was saved from probable death by Jekabs Kulis, a sergeant of a Latvian police battalion after begging for bread and making the drunken soldiers laugh.Christopher Martin, Michigan War Studies Review - book reviews, literature surveys, essays, and commentary. Kulis adopted him as the battalion's mascot, after secretly warning him never to reveal his Jewish identity. According to Kurzem's memory Kulis and his commander Lobe changed the story and rehearsed with him a narrative by which he was a Russian orphan who had lost his parents in the forest. The story was reiterated to him following the war by his former commanders and Latvian family. This was the narrative he told his family until he began opening up to the past. Throughout his childhood, Kurzem appeared in Nazi propaganda media as an Aryan mascot, including at least one newsreel. Kurzem says that on one occasion his commanding officer, Karlis Lobe, ordered him to hand out chocolates to other Jews to calm them as they boarded trucks that took them to be exterminated at the chocolate Leime factory in Riga. In 1944, according to Kurzem, with the Nazis facing almost certain defeat, and after trying to escape the unit in the Wolichow marshes, the commander of the Latvian SS unit sent Kurzem to live with a Latvian family, and with them was removed to a displaced persons camp in Hamburg, Germany, from which he emigrated to Australia in 1949. He worked in a circus and eventually became a television repair man in Melbourne. He had three sons with his wife Patricia (died 2003). All the time, he kept his past life to himself, not even telling his wife or children. It was not until 1997 that he finally told his family, and along with his son, Mark, set about discovering more about his past. Media In 2002, Kurzem's son Mark (died 2010Mark Kurzem obituary  From the Guardian  The Guardian) wrote and produced a documentary (with Lina Caneva) entitled The Mascot, which tells his father's story of his childhood among the Latvian SS. Mark subsequently wrote a book, The Mascot, Unravelling the Mystery of My Jewish Father's Nazi Boyhood, which tells the same story.Mark Kurzem (2002). The Mascot, Unravelling the Mystery of My Jewish Father's Nazi Boyhood. . It was reported his story has inspired a full-length Hollywood feature film.\\"Alex Kurzem - making peace with Ilya Galperin\\". Kurzem has received reparations from the Jewish Claims Conference as a victim of Nazi persecution. On May 19, 2011, Melbourne reporter Keith Moor published an article that questions the veracity of Kurzem's story and reports of simultaneous investigations by the German and U.S. governments as well as the Jewish Claims Conference into Kurzem's claims of actually being Jewish and a victim of Nazi persecution.\\"Nothing to Hide Holocaust Survivor\\"  Herald Sun. Victoria. On September 21, 2012, Dan Goldman, a reporter for Israel's daily newspaper Haaretz, published an article about the investigation into Kurzem's story. Kurzem was quoted in the article that he \\"never said\\" he was Ilya Galperin. Despite previously asking for to take a DNA test as reported by Keith Moor in 2011, Goldberg reports that Kurzem will take the test.Dan Goldberg, \\"Holocaust Survivor in Australia Faces Questions of Authenticity\\". Haaretz.com. Suspicions about the accuracy and authenticity of Kurzem's story were first raised in the late 1990s at the Melbourne Holocaust Centre. The Testimonies Director at the Centre, Phillip Maisel, who recorded Kurzem's story formed the impression that his interviewee was not being entirely truthful: \\"There was something strange about his story, something didn't add up.\\" Forensic researcher Colleen Fitzpatrick, who was previously instrumental in exposing two books about the Holocaust as fraudulent, wrote that there are similarities in the Narrative to those, and that Maisel, an experienced interviewer of many survivors, had read accounts from the Yizkor book of Koidanow that the massacre was done in a surprise action and was over within hours contrary to Kurzem's claims. According to her, Maisel had asked Kurzem about hiding his circumcision and received an evasive answer very untypical of other survivors, and that Maizel claimed Kurzem said he was unsure about his memory of his mother being shot. Fitzpatrick, along with Dr. Barry Resnick, discovered that the GILF document on which his reparations were based and which is published in the book is an unauthentic translation to English and the original was never submitted. No records of an Ilya Galpern/Halperin or his mother exist although records of other Galperin family members murdered in the town do exist. She claims Kurzem was removed from the Washington Holocaust Museum after remarking that it was a business. Fitzpatrick wrote that she had an email exchange between Mark Kurzem and a cousin of his, speaking about receiving the highest payment possible. And concluded: \\"Mr. Kurzem not only has and will continue to experience substantial financial gain and recognition from his books and his movie, he also lectures internationally to school children, thereby feeding the next generation with what may be distortions of the truth.\\" In 2013, Alex Kurzem has been cleared to continue receiving compensation from the German Government. The Jewish Claims Conference ordered the investigation. The report of the ombudsman was \\"satisfied Mr Kurzem was Jewish; was separated from his parents during the war; lived under a false identity for at least 18 months, and; that his life had been in danger\\".\\"Compensation claim upheld as Holocaust story believed\\"  Herald Sun. Victoria. There is no doubt that he is the \\"mascot\\" boy, but the members of the Latvian SS unit still claim they were not part of the Slonim massacre and had not participated in any atrocities in accordance with the deposition Kurzem wrote for Kārlis Lobe. In the book Mark Kurzem tells of the doubts raised on both sides, claiming the Latvian denials were planned and expected but that the Jewish ones were a surprise.

History  RM 2222 originally terminated at the (then) Austin city limits when it was designated on September 29, 1954; it was expanded to its current termination point at Lamar Boulevard on July 16, 1957. In the late 1980s, the city of Austin developed plans to expand RM 2222 east of Loop 1 into an east–west freeway, SH 169, connecting with US 290. The plans were rejected in the 1990s, citing adverse effects on the environment and existing neighborhoods. On June 27, 1995, the designation of RM 2222 was changed to Urban Road 2222 (UR 2222), although—as with all Urban Roads—no signage changes have been made.  Route description  RM 2222 begins at an intersection with RM 620 in west Austin in the Four Points neighborhood. Northwest of RM 620, the road is called Bullick Hollow Road and continues to the east side of Lake Travis. RM 2222 proceeds southeast from RM 620 for to intersect Loop 360. This section of road is a four-lane, lightly developed Texas Hill Country road. It includes Tumbleweed Hill, a half-mile ten-percent gradient hill. City Park Road, leading to the Emma Long Metropolitan Park at Lake Austin, is accessible from RM 2222 just west of Loop 360. After crossing Loop 360, RM 2222 continues southeast to Loop 1 (Mopac Boulevard). This section is a winding, scenic four-lane road built into the cliffs over Lake Austin. As RM 2222 approaches Loop 1, it enters a more heavily developed residential area. After crossing Loop 1, RM 2222 continues southeast to its termination at Spur 69, which leads to US 290 and I-35. Although the designation after Lamar Boulevard changes to Spur 69, the road is still signed as RM 2222 through to I-35. This section of road is a four-lane, heavily developed urban residential and commercial road. RM 2222 has several names over its length. Its westernmost segment is merely called RM 2222 (although it is sometimes erroneously referred to as FM 2222 or RR 2222). As it approaches its more developed stretch west of Loop 1, RM 2222 picks up the name Northland Drive. After crossing Shoal Creek Boulevard, the name changes to Allandale Road, named for the Allandale neighborhood through which it passes. Finally, after passing Burnet Road, the name changes to Koenig Lane (pronounced KAY- nig), and remains so to the junction with I-35.

Services include international and domestic household goods shipments, global mobility, immigration, departure, destination and setting in services, fine art storage and transportation, hard and soft copy records management and storage, freight forwarding, third-party distribution, wine storage, office fit out and commercial relocation. Company overview Crown Beijing, China In 2018, Crown Worldwide Group generated revenue of approximately US$828 million, owned assets of $736 million. Operating more than 8.5 million square feet of warehouse space, one of the company's principal strategies is to continuously invest in new facilities. The Group includes: Crown World Mobility, Crown Relocations, Crown Records Management, Crown Fine Art, Crown Logistics, Crown Wine Cellars and the latest addition of Crown Workspace.  History  Crown's first warehouse, 1965 In 1965, American Jim Thompson (then residing in Yokohama, Japan), recognized the need for an international moving service, so established Crown Worldwide Group. With $1,000 he established Transport Services International (as it was then known) in Yokohama with one office. In 1970, the company expanded into Hong Kong and then into Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and other Asia Pacific locations. In 1975, Transport Services International became Crown Pacific, and by the early 1980s, was firmly established in Asia. As a result of the increased mobility of the global population, further growth and offices were established across America, Australasia, and Europe. These developments accompanied a new company name, Crown Worldwide Group. Thompson is the founder and chairman. He graduated from San Jose State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering. He travelled to Asia shortly after graduation and has lived in Japan and Hong Kong ever since. Thompson is a U.S. citizen and a permanent resident of Hong Kong In 2002, Jim Thompson, realized that there were no wine cellars in Asia. He made a proposal, to the Hong Kong Government to convert the Central Ordnance Munitions Depot into a commercial wine cellar, with a private members clubhouse and conservatory. After negotiating with 22 government departments and signing a seven-year lease, Crown Worldwide Group invested HKD 30 million ($3.8 million), and the Crown Wine Cellars opened in 2003. The Hong Kong wine cellars occupy four of 12 original pairs of bunkers. The clubhouse has three reception areas, two of which are located approximately twenty meters underground. They can accommodate approximately one hundred people for seated dinner events and over two hundred people for private cocktails functions. Crown Wine Cellars has subsequently opened facilities in Mainland China. The Hong Kong facility, located in a park-like setting in Shouson Hill, a suburb on Hong Kong Island, consists of two underground bunkers built by the British during World War II. Crown converted the bunkers and opened a private members' clubhouse. =Important milestones = In the 55 years that Crown has existed, it has reached and achieved many defining milestones. Having previously provided transportation of two expositions for the Louvre Museum, \\"Le Christ mort\\" and \\"Le sacre de Napoleon.\\" Crown Fine Art handled the relocation of the Mona Lisa in 2005. The museum curator sought professional help removing the painting to change the frame and re-hang it. The Crown Fine Art team reported that although the Mona Lisa is a small painting, it is so well secured that it is actually heavy. In April, 2007, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR Government, China presented two young pandas to Hong Kong. Crown Relocations was involved in transporting the pandas to their new home in Ocean Park Hong Kong, a marine-based theme park located on the southern side of Hong Kong Island. The giant pandas arrived on April 26, 2007, and were unveiled to the public on July 1, the 10th anniversary of the Hong Kong SAR government. More recently, the newest brand of the Group, Crown Workspace has seen a massive rise since its launch and in 2018 Workspace saw the acquisitions of Fusion Workplace Services (FIL) and Premier Workplace Services. Crown Fine Art supported the Rijksmuseum in the start of Operation Night Watch by moving the painting by Rembrandt (1642) for the third time. Being the biggest and most wide-ranging research and conservation project in the history of Rembrandt’s masterpiece, the move, led by the Rijksmuseum alongside Crown Fine Art experts, is the first since December 11, 2003, when Crown Fine Art successfully moved the painting to the Philips Wing in the Rijksmuseum for the museum's ten-year renovation.

Aquino-Galman Case On December 2, 1985, Justice Manuel Pamaran of the Sandiganbayan rendered judgment in Criminal Cases Nos. 10010-10011 acquitting all the 16 accused, who allegedly killed Benigno Aquino Jr.. However, the High Court nullified said proceedings and ordered a re-trial of the cases before the Sandiganbayan (Galman vs. Sandiganbayan, 144 SCRA 43, 1986). In his 177 pages decision dated September 28, 1990, Hermosisima Jr.'s Sandiganbayan found the said accused guilty as principals of the crime of murder in both Criminal Cases Nos. 10010 and 10011, and he sentenced them to reclusion perpetua in each case. The judgment became final after this Court denied petitioners’ petition for review of the Sandiganbayan decision for failure to show reversible error in the questioned decision, as well as their subsequent motion for reconsideration. In August 2004, the said accused asked the High Tribunal to re-open the case, but the last appeal was denied. Supreme Court, Custodio vs. Sandiganbayan On August 21, 2007, (Aquino’s 24th death anniversary), Enrile stated that the case of the 14 soldiers incarcerated for 24 years now, due to the assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr. should be reviewed for clemency. Enrile paid for the legal services of the soldiers during their trial, and said the soldiers and their family have suffered enough. 15 soldiers of the Aviation Security Command were sentenced to double life imprisonment for the double murder of Aquino and his alleged lone communist gunman, Rolando Galman, and one of them had died. They were all acquitted on December 1985, by the Sandiganbayan' Manuel Pamaran, but the Sandiganbayan's Regino C. Hermosisima Jr. (promoted to Supreme Court Justice and incumbent 3 termer Judicial and Bar Council regular member) convicted them on Sept. 28, 1990. Inquirer.net, Enrile seeks clemency for soldiers in Aquino slay On the 24th Anniversary of the death of Benigno Aquino Jr., Cory stated that she had forgiven the 14 incarcerated soldiers for the assassination of her husband but she would not ever nod to appeals for their release. On the other hand, Andres Narvasa stressed that there was no direct evidence linking Ferdinand Marcos and Fabian Ver to the murder. Narvasa further pleaded for the release of the 14 soldiers since they have suffered enough, and warned that Mrs. Aquino is not a vengeful person. Abs-Cbn Interactive, Cory Aquino says she has forgiven Ninoy's killers 2 guns that changed Philippine history On August 21, 2007, the 24th anniversary of Ninoy's murder, 2 guns which altered the course of Philippine history are rusting away in the drawers of the Sandiganbayan. The first is the charcoal- toned Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum pistol, with a grip made of deer horn, was discovered near the body of Rolando Galman, and was marked “Exhibit 32. Its twin or the 2nd gun surfaced when the Supreme Court ordered a retrial in 1986. This 2nd gun, which has the same serial number “K919079” as the first one was marked as “Exhibit 12,” and really added to the mystery of Aquino’s assassination. Sandiganbayan Associate Justice Regino C. Hermosisima Jr. in a 177-page decision promulgated on September 1990, incarcerated the 16 soldiers who were already acquitted by Manuel Pamaran's Sandiganbayan. In the 1990 judgment, the gun’s owner was Col. Octavio Alvarez, who retired from the military on March 7, 1985. Both the Agrava Board report and the Hermosisima Jr. court resolved that it was either a .45 cal. or a .38 cal. pistol that was used in killing Aquino, thereby dismissing Olivas’ magnum theory, which pointed to Rolando Galman as the killer and the weapon as the .357 Magnum pistol. The court maintained that it was Moreno who shot Aquino but that he used a different gun. But the real weapon and the masterminds are still unaccounted after 24 years. Meanwhile, the 2 mysterious Magnum revolvers will remain at the Sandiganbayan’s bodega until the return of Capt. Felipe Valerio, the group commander of the Avsecom 805th Special Operations Squadron, who might be the last key to Aquino’s death.

It is endemic to low shrublands in the state of Hawaii in the United States. It is present on the islands of Kauai, Oahu, Lanai, Molokai, and Maui. At the time it was added to the endangered species list of the United States in 1991 it was known from seven populations for a total of fewer than 1000 individuals.USFWS. Centaurium sebaeoides Five Year Review. August 27, 2010. It is threatened by habitat loss. Until 2004 it was a member of genus Centaurium; it and several other species have since been transferred to other genera. This is the only plant in the gentian family, Gentianaceae, that is native to Hawaii. This is an annual herb, one of only 3% of Hawaiian flora that have annual life cycles. It often bears white flowers but pink flowers are not uncommon. The number and size of populations fluctuates quite a bit, and there may be unknown small, ephemeral populations that exist for a season and then die away. The species likely has a large soil seed bank and when an area gets higher rainfall there is a greater germination rate. The plant is somewhat nondescript and resembles two species of common weeds, scarlet pimpernel (Anagallis arvensis) and bitter herb (Centaurium erythraea), so it may grow unnoticed in some areas. Surveys occur every few years and find varying numbers of populations. 2010 estimates list three populations on Kauai with up to 52 plants total, four populations on Molokai with several thousand plants, two populations on Oahu with up to 130 plants, seven or eight populations on Maui with several thousand individuals, and only a few plants on Lanai in a single population. The global population is estimated at about 6000 during wet years. This plant occurs in sand and volcanic and clay soils on bluffs and dunes in drier coastal areas. A major threat to the species is the invasion of introduced plant species such as Casuarina equisetifolia, C. glauca, Prosopis pallida, and Bryophyllum pinnatum. Each island has a different array of invasive flora, so management plans vary. Casuarina species are among the worst offenders because they spread so thickly they outcompete smaller plants. Many parts of its habitat are degraded by livestock including cattle and goats, which trample and compact the soil, and by off-road vehicles. This damage can lead to erosion. Plants occurring near trails may be trampled by hikers. Fire is a threat to some populations.

SoSA relies on support from donors, volunteers and farmers as they glean nutritious excess produce from farmers' fields and orchards after harvest and deliver it to people in need across the United States. SoSA provides nutritious, healthy produce through programs such as the Potato Project, the Gleaning Network, Harvest of Hope, and the Seed Potato Project. Gleaning is the Biblical practice of hand-gathering crops left in the fields after harvest. Society of St. Andrew staff coordinates volunteers, growers, and distribution agencies to provide food for hungry people through gleaning. Each year, tens of thousands of volunteers come together across the country to glean food left in farmers' fields and orchards so that it does not go to waste but instead goes to the tables of those in need. Program services *SoSA supplies fresh fruits and vegetables vital for nutrition rather than high caloric \\"filler food\\" to society's most vulnerable. That means improved health and well-being as well as full stomachs. *Unlike many organizations, SoSA charges no handling fees. Fresh, nutritious food is provided to agencies serving the poor at no cost to them, which helps them stretch their already tight budgets. *SoSA's programs build community by bringing people together in farmers' fields or around \\"dumped\\" loads of potatoes to work collectively in the cause of helping their needy neighbors. *Each program recognizes the spiritual component of helping others and therefore offers a variety of educational programs, Bible studies, and seasonal devotions designed to feed people's spiritual hungers as they help feed the physical hunger of others. The Society of St. Andrew adheres to Christian principles of good stewardship. Therefore, about 93% of all funds raised by the Society of St. Andrew is spent on the direct delivery of food and services to the hungry. SoSA volunteers have salvaged over 500 million pounds of produce since the Society of St. Andrew began its gleaning and salvage operations in 1983. After factoring in administrative overhead costs, that means that food is provided at a cost to SoSA of just under $0.02 per serving. In other words, for under $50, the Society of St. Andrew can provide a person the USDA recommended requirement of vegetables and fruits for an entire year.  Programs  SoSA's volunteer network is channeled through three main programs: the Potato Project, the Gleaning Network, and Harvest of Hope. =Potato Project= Potato Project is a program of the Society of St. Andrew. It's a cost-effective way to move produce to the tables of hungry Americans instead of to landfills, reducing waste and fulfilling a social need at the same time. Since the Potato Project was started in 1979, over 500 million pounds of produce have been salvaged through this and other SoSA programs. Although logistics can get tricky, the concept of the Potato Project is practical and straightforward: tractor-trailer loads of potatoes and other produce are often rejected by commercial markets or potato chip factories due to imperfections in shape, size, surface blemishes, or sugar content. Usually, these perfectly edible rejected loads end up at landfills. Through the Potato Project, however, the Society of St. Andrew is able to redirect these 45,000-pound loads of fresh, nutritious produce to soup kitchens, Native American reservations, food pantries, low income housing areas, local churches, and other hunger agencies for distribution to the poor. The produce is donated, so the Society of St. Andrew only pays for the transportation and packaging of the food — just six cents per pound or two cents per serving. The food is passed along to those in need at no cost to them. SoSA programs operate on individual donations, church donations, and foundation grants at less than 7% overhead. =Gleaning Network= Gleaning is the traditional Biblical practice of gathering crops that would otherwise be left in the fields to rot or be plowed under after harvest. Because the food is unmarketable, usually due to cosmetic reasons, some growers allow crews of gleaners to pick what is left after harvest to donate to those who are needy. It is also often more cost-effective for farmers to have their crops gleaned than to have paid pickers go back through the fields for the missed produce. The Society of St. Andrew's Gleaning Network coordinates volunteers, growers, and distribution agencies to salvage food for the needy. Tens of thousands of volunteers from churches, synagogues, scout troops, senior citizen groups, and other organizations participate each year in Gleaning Network activities all across the country. Each year, tens of millions of pounds of produce are salvaged and given to the poor at no cost to them. Gleaners are people of all ages and income levels who give their time and energy to this process. Within 48 hours of picking the produce, hungry Americans are usually eating the gleaned food. Each year, about 30,000 people join the Gleaning Network in salvaging over 15 million pounds of fresh, nutritious food for their hungry neighbors. The Society of St. Andrew has staff Gleaning Network coordinators in several states as well as volunteer coordinators nationwide. Volunteering can take place over a single morning or for many years of service, and is seen as a practical, humanitarian response to the problem of hunger. =Harvest of Hope= Harvest of Hope is the ecumenical study, worship, and action mission trip program of the Society of St. Andrew. At Harvest of Hope, participants work in fields gleaning food for the hungry, study hunger issues, and participate in Christian worship. A variety of events take place throughout the year: week-long retreats for senior high youth (completed grades 9–12) and their adult sponsors; weekend retreats for junior high youth (completed grades 6–8) and their adult sponsors; a weekend retreat for college groups and young adults (ages 18–30); and weekend intergenerational retreats for ages 10 to 100. Harvest of Hope educates participants about the hunger problem domestically and globally and encourages them to make lifelong commitments to being part of the solution.  Locations  In addition to its national headquarters in Big Island, Virginia, the Society of St. Andrew operates regional offices in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Alabama, Indiana, Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi. These offices administer extensive gleaning networks that cover much of these states and are responsible for all Society of St. Andrew operations within their respective states.  History  The Society of St. Andrew was started by Rev. Ken Horne and Rev. Ray Buchanan, two United Methodist ministers, concerned with world hunger. In 1979, the two ministers were granted \\"a special appointment beyond the local church\\" by then Virginia Conference Bishop, Kenneth Goodson so they could found The Society of St. Andrew in Big Island, Virginia. For the next five years the two pastors and their families lived together in order to model a simpler lifestyle that rejected consumerism by growing their own vegetables, raising sheep, chickens, and rabbits, etc. At the same time the two pastors lead workshops on responsible lifestyles and hunger issues. During one such workshop at Franktown United Methodist Church on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a Farmer named Butch Nottingham questioned Ken and Ray about the facts they presented regarding food waste. From the discussion that followed, the Potato and Produce Project was born. On June 3, 1983, a farmer from Chadbourn, North Carolina, donated a tractor-trailer load of sweet potatoes to the Society of St. Andrew. This first load of salvaged sweet potatoes was delivered to the Central Virginia Food Bank in Richmond, Virginia. Since that first load in 1983 the Society of St. Andrew's Potato and Produce Project has distributed well over 500 million pounds of food to America's hungry. Originally the ministry operated out of a converted sheepshed on the farm in Big Island. A new building was constructed in 1990 to house the growing ministry. Also in 1990, as an offshoot of the Potato and Produce Project, The Society of St. Andrew began the Seed Potato Project to offer a hand-up to impoverished communities who wish to grow their own produce. In 1985, the Society of St. Andrew launched Harvest of Hope, a gleaning and study camp for youth. The first event was held at Camp Occahannock-on-the-Bay, on Virginia's Eastern Shore, and was led by Rev. Rhonda VanDyke Colby. A major component of Harvest of Hope is field gleaning. As more and more people became exposed to gleaning, they wanted to introduce it to their own churches. As a result, the Gleaning Network was established in Virginia in 1988. Since then, gleaning has expanded dramatically. Beginning in 1992, the Society of St. Andrew has expanded into other states in the form of regional offices and gleaning ministries.

History  António Ribeiro dos Santos, the first director of the library. The library was created by Decree of 29 February 1796, under the name of Royal Public Library of the Court (). The library's objective was to allow the general public access to the court's collections, thus bucking the trend of the time only available to scholars and sages could access the treasures, manuscripts, paintings, and books of the royal court. In the dawn of the victory of the Liberals following the Portuguese Civil War and the abolition of the religious orders (1834), the institution was renamed the National Library of Lisbon and was officially entrusted with all or part of the libraries of numerous monasteries and convents. The arrival of these large collections made it absolutely necessary to move to larger premises, and the choice fell on the Convento de São Francisco. Over the more than 130 years in which it operated in the Chiado area of Lisbon, the BNL experienced periods of modernisation and enrichment and times of greyness and lethargy. We should particularly note the efforts that were made in the 19th century to absorb the collections of the abolished religious establishments, organise bibliographic exhibitions and publish catalogues of a variety of collections. The proclamation of the Republic (1910) was followed by the incorporation of a new wave of libraries from another round of abolitions of religious institutions. Between 1920 and 1926 the BNL enjoyed a phase in which it took a major step forward in the field of library and information science and benefited from a flourishing cultural life, all of which was promoted by the so-called “Library Group”. The growth of the collections and the need for conditions suited to the conservation of the Library's rich holdings made it indispensable to construct a purpose-designed building that would provide the largest Portuguese bibliographic collection with a proper home. Work began in 1958, to a design by the architect Porfírio Pardal Monteiro, and the Library was transferred to the new building in the Campo Grande area in 1969. The process of computerising the Library began in the 1980s, alongside a broader project intended to support all of Portugal's libraries in this respect, which resulted in the creation of the National Bibliographic Database – PORBASE. At the same time as it adapted to the process of technological evolution, the Library continued to enrich its collections. Of particular significance was the creation of an Archive of Writers’ Personal Papers, but a number of major initiatives were also undertaken with regard to the standardisation of library and information techniques, preservation and conservation, and cultural activities. At the beginning of this century the Library has been accompanying the international trend towards the digitisation of bibliographic collections, with the creation of the (National Digital Library, BND), which is constantly growing and works closely with other European institutions. Already more than 200 years old, in 2007 the Institution was renamed the National Library of Portugal (BNP) and began a restructuring process that is seeking to help both enrich and publicise the nation's bibliographic heritage, and to modernise, rationalise and improve its own operations in such a way as to serve the public, the professional community, and publishers and booksellers.  Mission and activities  The BNP's mission is to collect, process and preserve the Portuguese documentary heritage, including documents in Portuguese and about Portugal, whatever their format or carrier. It is also charged with studying and disseminating that heritage and ensuring the conditions which people need in order to be able to enjoy it, as well as classifying and inventorying the nation's bibliographic heritage assets. Under this definition, which is set out in the Organic Law governing the BNP, the Library continues to pursue the essence of the fundamental purposes and objectives for which it was created in 1796, but is also responsible for the provision of a more varied range of services to both Portuguese culture and the public in general – among other ways, via the Online Catalogue of our collections and the Digital National Library – and the professionals in the publishing and information and documentation sectors. To this end the BNP acts as the National Bibliographic Agency, which is responsible for the mandatory legal deposit of publications and the country's ISSN, ISMN and CIP (Cataloguing in Publication) services, the recording and dissemination of the Portuguese National Bibliography, and the coordination and management of PORBASE – the National Bibliographic Database. In this respect it has also undertaken a variety of actions that help to promote the professional development of libraries, in conjunction with its role as the body with responsibility for national standards concerning documentation and information in Portugal. Protecting and enhancing the country's bibliographic heritage are another two fundamental aspects of the BNP's mission, in its dual role as the entity that is responsible for preserving and controlling that heritage and the keeper of Portugal's largest collection of bibliographic treasures. It is also charged with studying and publicising the latter in Portugal and abroad, which is accomplished by means of a range of projects involving inter-institutional cooperation, exhibitions, research activities and publications.  Collections  Reading room (November 2019) The National Library of Portugal is the largest library in the country and a prestigious institution on the cultural scene. It collects, processes and preserves the nation's bibliographic heritage and makes it available to the intellectual and scientific community. The National Library of Portugal has a wide variety of collections that encompass documentation from every era, of every type and on every subject. A combination of the legal deposit system, acquisitions and donations mean that our holdings are constantly evolving. A special emphasis is placed on Portuguese works. = General collection = The General Collection is the BNP's largest, with more than 3 million items, most of which are Portuguese publications. It covers the period from the 16th to the 21st centuries. Initially composed of the holdings of the Library of the Royal Board of Censorship and the libraries of convents that were abolished in 1834, the collection is divided into sections of monographs by major topic, a set of special collections that have been donated to us over the years, and a huge collection of 50,000 Portuguese periodical titles and around 240 foreign ones. The General Collection systematically contains everything that has been published in Portugal and provided to the Library under the Legal Deposit system since 1931. It also includes the theses and other academic works produced at Portugal's universities, which have also been subject to mandatory legal deposit since 1986. = Rare Books and Manuscripts = The various collections that we generically term \\"Rare books and manuscripts\\" encompass the most valuable and important heritage assets in the BNP's holdings. The collection of Manuscripts is currently actually made up of six collections, with library and archive documents of various genres and types and with a wide range of origins, from the 12th century to the present day. The overall collection contains a total of around 15,000 codices and 36,000 sundry manuscripts. The collection of rare Printed Books is made up of a selection of works whose rarity, age or publishing characteristics earn them a place in the BNP's \\"Valuable Reserve\\" of printed books, which numbers more than 30,000 items. There are two main sections, which are divided on the basis of age: up until 1500 (Incunabula); and printed since 1501 (Rare books). They also have a number of other collections, which are grouped on the basis of a number of different criteria, such as subject, printer, or special characteristics. The Historical Archive contains archive documents from a variety of sources, with an emphasis on personal and family archives. The oldest documents date from the 11th century. In total there are around 466 separate collections (or parts of collection). The BNP's own Historical Archive is included under this heading. The Archive of Contemporary Portuguese Culture (ACPC) is currently home to the collections of personal papers of 148 writers and other figures from the 19th and 20th centuries. Leading names include Fernando Pessoa, Eça de Queirós, Camilo Castelo Branco, Camilo Pessanha, Antero de Quental, Oliveira Martins, Jaime Cortesão, Raul Proença, Vitorino Nemésio, Vergílio Ferreira and José Saramago, among others. = Cartography = The Cartography collection holds around 6,800 titles composed of both printed and manuscript atlases, maps and plans that have been made and/or published since the 16th century. Although the collection includes cartographic representations of every part of the world, the majority of the items portray Portugal and its former overseas domains. = Iconography = The Iconographic collections contain around 117,000 images on paper and have constituted a specialised section of the Library since 1976. They were originally formed from three initial collections that belonged to the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division (Prints, Drawings, and Religious Pictures), but were organised into a separate collection when the Library became fully aware of their importance to the study of history, sociology, art and so on, and came to recognise their heritage value. = Music = The BNP's Music Collection is one of the most important in Portugal, and is especially useful for historical and musicological research. It contains more than 50,000 items ranging from the 12th to the 20th centuries, most of which were produced in Portugal. In addition to printed and manuscript scores, it offers books and periodicals on musical subjects, librettos, programmes, posters, photographs, a variety of personal and institutional archives and other material linked to the production of music and musical recordings. = Reading for the Visually Impaired = The reading service for the Visually Impaired has held and produced works in Braille and audio books since 1969. The service uses the paper, magnetic tape and digital formats. It has more than 7,000 items in Braille, including 4,000 musical works, and 1,575 audio titles.

Educated at the Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1935, Hurst was a research assistant to Professor Felix Frankfurter, and later a law clerk to Justice Louis D. Brandeis. Hurst spent most of his professional career as a professor of law at the University of Wisconsin Law School in Madison, Wisconsin. He was Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions at the University of Cambridge in 1967. Hurst had his greatest influence through his writings. His first major book, The Growth of American Law: The Law Makers (Little, Brown, 1950), examined the various institutions and groups that made law in America from independence through the mid-twentieth century—legislatures, the courts, the executive, the bar, and administrative agencies. His most influential work, Law and the Conditions of Freedom in the Nineteenth-Century United States (University of Wisconsin Press, 1956), was famous for his thesis that Americans used law to release the population's creative energies. The book usually deemed his masterwork is Law and Economic Growth: A Legal History of the Lumber Industry in Wisconsin, 1836-1915 (Harvard University Press, 1964; reissued with new introduction, University of Wisconsin Press, 1984). Hurst's other books include Justice Holmes and Legal History (Macmillan, 1965), Law and Social Process in the United States (University of Michigan Press, 1960), Law and Social Order in the United States (Cornell University Press, 1977), A Legal History of Money in the United States 1774-1970 (University of Nebraska Press, 1971), The Legitimacy of the Business Corporation in the Law of the United States (University of Virginia Press, 1970), Dealing with Statutes (Columbia University Press, 1982), and Law and Markets in United States History: Different Modes of Bargaining Among Interests (University of Wisconsin Press, 1982). In 1971 he collected a series of influential law- review articles from the 1940s under the title The Law of Treason in the United States (Greenwood Press, 1971).

The River Knobs — formerly known as East Seneca Ridge — are a ridge and series of knobs in western Pendleton County, West Virginia, USA, along a stretch of the North Fork South Branch Potomac River. Although the Knobs (peak elevation: 2,854 ft) are dwarfed by Spruce Mountain to the west (peak: 4,840 ft) and by North Fork Mountain to the east (peak: 4,588 ft), they are notable for their series of prominent \\"razorback\\" ridges or \\"fins\\". The largest and most famous of these blade-like crags is Seneca Rocks. Geography The River Knobs stretch for about from near Cherry Grove to near Seneca Rocks and are situated in a southwest/northeast orientation. They are a minor part of the High Alleghenies of the Appalachian Mountain Range. Their rock outcrops are clearly visible from WV 55 and US 33. Each is associated with a named gap through which a stream has transected the ridge and exposed the bedrock. From north to south the most prominent features are Roy Gap (with its Seneca Rocks), Harper Knob (2,820 ft), Harper Gap, Harmon Knob (2,854 ft), Hinkle Gap, Germany Knob (2,802 ft), Riverton Gap, Judy Gap (with its Judy Rocks), Nelson Gap (with its Nelson Rocks), False Gap, Lambert Gap, Pike Gap and Teter Gap. The Knobs are part of the same structural fold of the earth's crust that continues to the north as Champe Knobs (with its Champe Rocks and Yellow Rocks) and to the south as River Hill and (in Virginia) Lantz Mountain. Geology Champe Rocks, at the northern end of the River Knobs Seneca Rocks Judy Rocks The exposed rock of the River Knobs is a tough quartzite, Tuscarora Sandstone, an extremely hard sedimentary rock, ranging in color from a nearly translucent white, to gray, pink or orange. Laid down as sediment on a sea floor 440 million years ago, in West Virginia the Tuscarora is 150 to thick. At the River Knobs, the quartzite layer has been \\"verticalized\\" by geological forces during the formation of the Appalachians some 230 million years ago. A folding of the Earth's crust forced this layer - and the surrounding strata - into enormous arches, miles wide. The River Knobs trace the western wall of this arch, or anticline, where the Tuscarora was turned a full 90 degrees from horizontal to vertical. Over time, erosion stripped away the softer rock covering the arch, and finally the dome of the arch itself. The tough quartzite of the western walls resisted this process, leaving the soaring \\"fins\\" - narrow vertical plates of exposed rock. About east, along the top of North Fork Mountain, the horizontal strata of the far slope of the Tuscarora anticline are also visible. (Within this eroded anticline lies Germany Valley, registered as a National Natural Landmark because of its unique karst topography.) At Champe Rocks and Nelson Rocks the outcroppings are seen as not one, but two parallel fins. The reason for this is that, during the rise of the Appalachians, the same forces which formed the anticline caused the Tuscarora to fault or rupture, with the upper layer sliding over and overlapping the lower. As the top of the arch wore away, two fins were left. Nelson Rocks is considered one of the best examples of the \\"faulted Tuscarora\\". Seneca Rocks is a much thicker, monolithic formation because there the rock did not fault cleanly into two layers, but rather rolled over on itself. From Roy Gap, looking north, this effect is clearly visible in the curving layers of rock surrounding the large cave in the south end of Seneca Rocks.

The film stars Shirley Booth in her final film, Anthony Perkins, and Shirley MacLaine. The screenplay by John Michael Hayes is based on the 1955 play of the same name by Thornton Wilder. The costumes were by Edith Head. Plot Set in 1884, the story focuses on Dolly Gallagher Levi, a widow who supports herself by a variety of means, with matchmaking as her primary source of income. Horace Vandergelder, a wealthy but miserly merchant from Yonkers, New York, has hired her to find him a wife, but unbeknownst to him Dolly is determined to fill the position herself. When he expresses his intent to travel to New York City to woo milliner Irene Molloy, Dolly shows him the photograph of a woman she calls Miss Ernestina Simple and tells him the buxom beauty would be a far better choice for him. Horace agrees to have dinner with Ernestina at the Harmonia Gardens after visiting Irene. Meanwhile, Horace's head clerk Cornelius Hackl convinces his sidekick Barnaby Tucker that they, too, deserve an outing to New York. The two cause cans of tomatoes to explode, spewing their contents about the store, which justifies their closing it for the day and heading to the city.Time review While there, they come across Irene's hat shop and Cornelius is instantly taken with her. The pair are forced to hide however, when Mr. Vandergelder and Dolly arrive. Though Dolly and Irene cover up for them, Mr. Vandergelder still realizes that Irene is hiding people in her shop (though he doesn't know who) and leaves in disgust. Irene furiously demands that Cornelius and Barnaby repay her by taking her and the shop assistant Minnie out to a fancy restaurant for dinner (Dolly had led her to believe that the men were secretly members of high society). By total coincidence, Cornelius, Barnaby, Irene, Minnie, Horace, and Dolly all dine at the same restaurant. Horace realizes that Dolly tricked him and that there is no such person as Ernestina Simple. Cornelius worries over how to pay for the meal until a well-meaning diner gives him Mr. Vandergelder's wallet (which the diner believes Cornelius dropped). Over the course of the evening, Irene and Cornelius fall in love as Barnaby falls for Minnie. The two men escape being caught by Mr. Vandergelder by disguising themselves as women and dancing towards the door. Before going, they leave the two women a note confessing who they really are and that they love them. The next day, Dolly and Cornelius pretend to be setting up a store of their own across the street from Mr. Vandergelders. Frightened by the competition, Horace gives the shopkeepers better working hours and wages. Realizing how foolishly he's been acting, he agrees to marry Dolly as well. Hello, Dolly! The 1964 Broadway musical Hello Dolly! starring Carol Channing and the 1969 film of the same name with Barbra Streisand and Walter Matthau were both based upon Wilder's play. See also * Hello, Dolly!

History National Parliamentary Library of Georgia The history of National Parliamentary Library of Georgia begins from 1846 when \\"Tiflis Public Library” was founded on the base of the Office of the Governor General of Tbilisi. By this, the desire of the Georgian society to have a library available for all levels of society was fulfilled. In 1848 the Public Library received the funds of \\"Private Associated Library” established on the initiative of the prominent public figure Dimitri Kipiani. By 1859 the fund of the Public Library had consisted of 13.260 volumes in 19 languages. As the funds grew, the building of the Office could not meet the requirements any more, and in 1851 the new building was built. In 1852 the Library was granted the right to receive two free copies of all publications printed in Caucasus. In 1868 Tiflis Public Library and the Caucasus Museum were united, and in 1913 Tiflis Public Library was transformed into the Scientific Library of the Caucasus Museum and was completely united with the latter. In 1914 the library was closed due to constructing a new building for the Caucasus Museum. The funds of the library were packed in the boxes and kept in the basement for ten years. The National Parliamentary Library of Georgia building #1 was built as the Bank of Nobility in 1913-16 by architect Anatoly Kalgin and artist Henryk Hryniewski. The statue of Shota Rustaveli at the entrance On 30 May 1923, on the base of the Tiflis Public Library and Parliamentary Library, the State Public Library of Georgia was founded. In 1937 the library obtained the funds of the library of the Society for Dissemination of Literacy among Georgians, which was active in 1880–1927, that made it the most complete collection of the national printed materials. In 1957 the library joined international book exchange network. In 1989 the library purchased its first personal computer, and since 1990 the digital catalogues have been created. From 1955 till 1990 the library was functioning under the name of \\"State Republic Library”; in 1990 it was granted the name \\"National Library of Georgia”. On 25 December 1996 it passed under control of Parliament of Georgia, and now its official name is \\"National Parliamentary Library of Georgia” (NPLG). In 2000 it was named after Ilia Chavchavadze, the great Georgian literary and public figure, widely regarded as one of the founding fathers of modern Georgia. Since 1991 the NPLG is a member of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA).

Wells Middle School (Brewster, NY) * C. V. Starr Intermediate School * Garden Street Elementary School * John F. Kennedy Elementary School (Brewster, NY) Brewster is located in the Town of Southeast, approximately north of New York City in Putnam County. The Town of Southeast surrounds the independent and separately governed Village of Brewster. Although the Town of Southeast is the larger municipality, the area is commonly referred to as \\"Brewster,\\" the name recognized by the Post Office. Schools =Brewster High School= Brewster High School is a comprehensive public secondary school for grades 9 – 12 with an enrollment of approximately 220 a year, students and over 110 teachers and support personnel. =Henry H. Wells Middle School= The Henry H. Wells Middle School was the second school building known to the Brewster Central School District. Opening in 1957, it was known as Brewster High School. At that time, it housed grades 6 - 12. Garden Street School served as the lone elementary building in the district for grades K - 5. Over time, as the district continued to grow, the 'new' Brewster High School could not keep up with the needs of the school community. In 1971, when Brewster High School was opened on Foggintown Road, the existing high school was rededicated as the Henry H. Wells Middle School - a school designed to work with the unique characteristics of the middle school child, grades 6 - 8. As the Brewster community continued to grow and prosper, the Middle School was called upon to assist by taking the 5th graders into their midst to crowded. From September 1990 - January 1998, the Middle School served grades 5 - 8. With the opening of C.V. Starr in January 1998, the building went back to grades 6 - 8. =C. V. Starr Intermediate School= The C. V. Starr Intermediate School was opened in January 1998. The erection of this building helped to solve some of the major overcrowding situations in the elementary schools and the middle school. When the doors were opened, 4th grade students from JFK Elementary and GSS Elementary, along with 5th grade students from the Wells Middle School were taken into a school. =John F. Kennedy Elementary School= John F. Kennedy Elementary School was erected in 1964 with 21 classrooms in the original building. In 1968, ten \\"open\\" classrooms were added as the \\"roundhouse.\\" There was also an expansion of the school cafeteria. During the summer of 2001, the \\"roundhouse\\" was renovated and each of the ten classrooms completely enclosed. Four portable classrooms were added in 1988 to accommodate the influx of children. John F. Kennedy had served as a kindergarten through grade five facility until 1990 when the fifth grade was moved to Henry H. Wells Middle School to accommodate its again growing population. With the building of C.V. Starr Intermediate School in 1998, the fourth grade vacated and JFK now houses kindergarten through second grades. =Garden Street Elementary School= Originally built in the late 19th century, Garden Street School burned to the ground and was rebuilt in 1925. The school served as the sole educational facility in Brewster until the Henry H. Wells \\"High School\\" was built in 1957. Over the years, two additions were built. The existing building stands as a 90-year-old landmark for the district and community. More recently, Garden Street School has served as a kindergarten through fifth grade elementary school facility. In 1990, the fifth grade was moved to H.H. Wells Middle School to alleviate overcrowding at GSS. Eight years later, Garden Street lost its fourth grade students and staff, as they moved to C.V. Starr Intermediate School. During the year 2011, an article titled Regions Aging Schools Crumble as Finances Falter by Cathey O'Donnell and Gary Stern, was featured in a local newspaper, The Journal News, which is well known throughout the Lower Hudson Valley of Westchester County, New York. The article was about many old school buildings within the region that were in a current state of disrepair, how much it would cost to fix them and which if any might need to be demolished. One of the schools mentioned in the article was Garden Street Elementary School. The article is quoted as saying, \\"Consider the fate of 86-year-old Garden Street Elementary in Brewster. Once a K-12 country school, it needs $11.6 million in upgrades for everything from toilet seats to a new elevator. School officials have decided to close it next year and move its students to newer buildings.\\" The school is now closed. The Garden Street Elementary School fate has not been determined. As of 2014 Garden Street School has now closed.

Distribution It is endemic to Catalina Island, one of the southern Channel Islands in Los Angeles County, California. It is known from just a single population, found in Wild Boar Gully, an arroyo covered in coastal sage scrub on Catalina Island. The steep sides of the arroyo contain soils of saussurite gabbro. It was rare when it was first discovered by Blanche Trask in 1897 or 1898, when about 40 to 50 plants were counted. When it was federally listed as an endangered species, in 1996, there were only six mature plants remaining. It has been called \\"one of the rarest shrubs in the continental United States\\" and \\"one of the rarest trees in North America.\\"USFWS. Cercocarpus traskiae Five Year Review. September 2007. Description Cercocarpus traskiae is a large shrub or tree that grows up to 8 meters in height. The leaves have thick, leathery oval blades with serrated edges and woolly-haired undersides. The leathery, woolly texture of the leaves distinguishes it from other Cercocarpus.Rieseberg, L. H. and D. Gerber. (1995). Hybridization in the Catalina Island mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus traskiae): RAPD evidence. Conservation Biology 9:1 199. The inflorescence is a cluster of up to 10 flowers which do not have petals. Plants do not always flower each year. While there are sometimes many seedlings noted, the seedling survival rate and rate of recruitment are quite low. As of 2007, there are only seven adult trees capable of reproduction, all located in Wild Boar Gully, and most of these are very old. Conservation The Catalina Island mountain mahogany is threatened by ungulates such as deer, and feral goats and pigs. The goats have been removed from the island, and fencing has been placed to prevent the remaining animals from touching the plants. This rare species hybridizes with its relative, Cercocarpus betuloides, a situation that may lead to genetic swamping of the rare plant. This hybridization may be made more likely by the animals' disturbance of the habitat. Many of the seedlings and saplings growing today may be hybrids. The population of pure Cercocarpus traskiae is not increasing and the species is entirely dependent on human intervention today.

The station operates on the FM radio frequency of 98.1 MHz, FM channel 251. The studios are located at 130 E. McConnell Street in Oxford, Indiana. The tower is located one mile east of Dunnington, Indiana, a small community in rural western Benton County. History WIBN signed on the air in 1983 at 98.3 on the FM dial originally built and owned by Frank and Sandra Hertel of Evansville, IN. The station originally broadcast at 3,000 watts and served specifically the communities of Earl Park, Fowler and Kentland. The studio and tower were both located in Earl Park. Initially, the format was a mix of country and Adult contemporary music. The station had stints doing each of the aforementioned formats exclusively throughout the 1980s. By the mid-1980s, the station was purchased by Lafayette, Indiana radio pioneer Sidney Thompson. His company, known as IBN Broadcasting, began looking into ways to make the station more powerful as well as more profitable. The 98.3 frequency was very cluttered in northwestern Indiana at the time with three other stations occupying the frequency within a 100-mile radius of WIBN. In 1988, the FCC granted a request to move WIBN to 98.1 and strengthen its power from 3,000 watts to 25,000 watts. This power increase would also provide the station with primary coverage to larger Illinois towns such as Watseka and Hoopeston and secondary coverage to Greater Lafayette. Once the move to 98.1 was complete, WIBN became an Adult contemporary station with programming provided by Satellite Music Network's Starstation format. In the mid-90s, Brothers Broadcasting Corporation, headed by John Balvich, purchased the station. The station maintained its affiliation with Starstation but renamed itself \\"Interstate 98\\" or \\"I-98\\" for short. As I-98, WIBN featured a mix of music, farm reports, and sports, both local and national. In 2001, it was decided that a new direction was necessary for the station. It was widely speculated that WIBN would attempt to program toward the Lafayette market, especially as many former Lafayette radio personalities and managers were hired in to oversee operations. Format speculations ranged from alternative rock to hot AC. By the Spring, it was decided that WIBN would become Hot adult contemporary as B 98. However, the decision was pulled right before the launch when Lafayette's WNJY changed format and became B 102.9. The station remained I-98 and kept its affiliation with ABC Radio's Hits and Favorites format (formerly Starstation) until October 1, 2001 when the station flipped to Oldies as \\"98 Gold\\" utilizing ABC Radio Networks Pure Gold format. Today, WIBN continues to program an oldies format and now uses Westwood One Networks Good Time Oldies. The station runs Brownfield farm reports and regional news. High school sports broadcasts run from mid-August with one football game per week, including post-season action. Then from November thru March, high school basketball games feature Benton Central and other area teams.(WIBN carries both boys' and girls' basketball). WIBN also broadcasts from area 4-H county fairs. In April 2010 WIBN's tower was knocked over by heavy farm equipment, which fell onto the building housing its transmitter, taking the station off the air.

He composed hymns in his language Kuanua.Papua New Guinea Music History He has been described as \\"probably the first Papua New Guinean music personality to receive attention from a wide public\\". Biography Blasius was born in February 1925 in the Paparatawa village in the Kokopo sub-province of East New Britain. Two months after he was born, his mother died, and his father, a Catholic priest, took him to Vunapope Convent. Blasius was raised by his sisters. In 1933, he was sent to Milmila Catholic Mission in the Duke of York Islands, where he attended primary school until 1938. He then returned to Vunapope and lived with his father until 1941. He was in Vunapope when the Japanese Army invaded New Britain, and in 1942, he was unwillingly recruited by the Japanese as an interpreter. During this time, he had to teach Japanese soldiers Melanesian Pidgin and Kuanua (the Tolai language). Towards the end of the war, suspected of sympathy towards the allied American and Australian armies, he was jailed and condemned to death by the Japanese, but was eventually freed by an American pilot. Blasius was happy when the war ended, and after a few months recovering from a leg injury, started working at the Nonga Military Hospital, becoming a doctor's driver in 1947. He later worked with the Department of Transport in Rabaul. He first started playing guitar in 1946, borrowing it from a brother-in-law for 5 shillings. At this time, his salary was very low and he could not afford to buy his own instrument. Nevertheless, later in the year he managed to buy himself a ukulele, and started his musical career. His first composition in 1949, was a series of four hymns. Then, he composed regularly, not only hymns, but also High Masses, ballads in his own Kuanua tongue, and satirical songs in Pidgin. Blasius To Una was very popular in the Gazelle Peninsula, but found fame all over Papua New Guinea, particularly amongst speakers of Pidgin. He was a regular participant of the Tolai Warwagira Festival, held annually in Rabaul, and took part in the Port Moresby Arts Festival in 1974. He also performed at numerous social occasions in his home province. His imagination and ingenuity was recognised amongst the Tolai people of East New Britain, and he was often commissioned to compose songs for a particular occasion or purpose. Two of his songs that were commissioned for this purpose were \\"A Umana Beo\\", written for the women of the Kabaira Vocational Centre, and \\"Iau Lus Man Takodo\\", written in June 1977 for a leader of the village of Nodup where Blasius latterly lived. Individuals and community groups would sometimes commission songs from him for traditional occasions, with some preferring his music to the orthodox Tolai music. At 53, Blasius was still actively making music.

He was born a slave but was later freed by his owner and continued to work at the cemetery as a grave digger. He helped historians locate some of the buildings and landmarks that existed prior to the establishment of Arlington National Cemetery such as the slave cemetery, roads and other key locations. He died at Freedman's Village in Arlington, Virginia and was granted special permission to be buried at Arlington by the Secretary of War. Biography Parks was born a slave on March 19, 1843 in Arlington, Virginia to Lawrence Parks and Patsy Clark. The first graves in Arlington National Cemetery were dug by James Parks, a former Arlington Estate slave. Parks was freed in 1862 under the terms of the will of his former owner, George Washington Parke Custis. He still lived on Arlington Estate when Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton signed the orders designating Arlington as a military burial ground. Parks served in the U.S. Army from 1861 to 1929 by working as a grave digger and maintenance man for the cemetery. Prior to his death Jim Parks gave specific locations for the wells, springs, slave quarters, the slave cemetery, dance pavilion, old roads, icehouse, blacksmith shop, and kitchens. He stated that all of his grandparents and parents were buried in the slave cemetery. At the time the article was written, the Department of Agriculture was in the process of uprooting the sacred ground for a farming area. It is not known what happened to the bodies interred in the slave cemetery. At the time of his death he left behind one of the few slave accounts on record from which much of the restoration of Arlington House was based. His testimony provided a complete record of the people who inhabited the plantation, the slaves and the Custis-Lee family. When Parks died on August 21, 1929, the Secretary of War Dwight Filley Davis granted special permission for him to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.

The original title was in the Baronetage of England and the other two in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. The earliest and the latest are both extinct, but one baronetcy is still extant. History The Walker Baronetcy was created in the Baronetage of England in 1679, for Sir George Walker of Bushey Hall in the County of Hertford. Sir George, the first baronet, was the son of Sir Walter Walker, the legal adviser to Queen Catherine of Braganza from 1661, who received a knighthood for his services. Sir Walter's grandson was named after him and, in turn, inherited the Walker baronetcy. This Sir Walter, the second baronet, was the last holder of the title: upon his death without an heir, the Bushey Hall baronetcy became extinct. The United Kingdom Walker – later Forestier-Walker – Baronetcy, of Castleton in the County of Monmouth, was created on 28 March 1835, for the soldier George Walker. The second baronet assumed by deed poll the additional surname of Forestier. Another member of the family, George Edmond Lushington Walker, fourth son of the first baronet, was a Major-General in the Army. The Forestier-Walker Baronetcy, of Rhiwderin in the County of Monmouth, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 9 July 1929 for the Conservative politician Sir Leolin Forestier-Walker.

Western North Dakota lands along Interstate 94 in North Dakota. With an average 17 inches of precipitation a year, North Dakota is one of the driest states in the United States. North Dakota's climate is typical of a continental climate with cold winters and warm-hot summers. The state's location in the Upper Midwest allows it to experience some of the widest variety of weather in the United States, and each of the four seasons has its own distinct characteristics. The eastern half of the state has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with warm to hot, somewhat humid summers and cold, windy winters, while the western half has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification 'BSk') with less precipitation and less humidity but similar temperature profiles. The areas east of the Missouri River get slightly colder winters, while those west of the stream get higher summer daytime temperatures. In general, the diurnal temperature difference is prone to be more significant in the west due to higher elevation and less humidity. General climatology Flooding in North Dakota in March 2010. Due to its location in the center of North America North Dakota experiences temperature extremes characteristic of a continental climate, with cold winters and hot summers. Each season has distinctive upper air patterns which bring different weather conditions with them. One feature of a continental climate is that weather patterns can be unpredictable. For example, an Alberta clipper, a low pressure system originating in the province of Alberta in Canada, would be a common winter occurrence in North Dakota. But with the general unpredictability of weather in a continental climate, such a storm system could occur in spring, or in late autumn. Hot weather, though usually confined to July and August, can sometimes begin as early as April or May, and could spill over into September or October. Being from any large body of water (with the exception of Lake Superior), temperatures and precipitation in North Dakota can vary widely. North Dakota is far enough north to experience −60 °F (−51 °C) temperatures and blizzards during the winter months, but far enough south to experience 121 °F (49 °C) temperatures and tornado outbreaks in the summer. The 181 °F degree (100 °C) variation between North Dakota's highest and lowest temperature is the 3rd largest variation of any U.S. State, and the largest of any non-mountainous state. North Dakota is far from major sources of moisture and is in the transition zone between the moist East and the semi- arid West, as precipitation and humidity decrease from east to west. Annual average precipitation across the state ranges from around 14 in (35.6 cm) in the west to 22 in (55.9 cm) in the east. Snow is the main form of precipitation from November through March, while rain is the most common the rest of the year. It has snowed in North Dakota during every month except July and August. =Statistics for ThreadEx cities= Seasons Winter in North Dakota is characterized by cold (below freezing) temperatures and snowfall. Snow is the main form of winter precipitation, but freezing rain, ice, sleet, and sometimes even rain are all possible during the winter months. Common storm systems include Alberta clippers or Panhandle hooks, some of which evolve into blizzards. Annual snowfall averages from 26 inches (66 cm) in the central part of the state to 38 inches (96.5 cm) in the northeast and southwest. Temperatures as low as −60 °F (−51 °C) have occurred during North Dakota winters. Spring is a time of major transition in North Dakota. Early spring commonly sees snowstorms, but by late spring as temperatures begin to moderate the state can experience tornado outbreaks, a risk which diminishes but does not cease through the summer and into the fall as North Dakota lies at the northern edge of Tornado Alley. Springtime flooding is a relatively common event in the Red River Valley, due to the river flowing north into Canada. The spring melt and the eventual runoff typically begins earlier in the southern part of the valley than in the northern part. The most destructive flooding in eastern North Dakota occurred in 1997, which caused extensive damage to Grand Forks. Summer sees heat and humidity predominate in the east, while hotter and less humid conditions are generally present in the west. These humid conditions help kick off thunderstorm activity 22–34 days a year. Summer high temperatures in North Dakota average in the mid 80s (30 °C) in the west to the upper 70s (25 °C) in the east, with temperatures as hot as 121 °F (49 °C) possible. The growing season in North Dakota usually begins in April, and harvest begins in September and October. Tornadoes are possible in North Dakota from April through October, but the peak tornado month is July, followed by June and August. The state averages 13 tornadoes per year. Depending on location, average annual precipitation ranges from 14 in (35.6 cm) to 22 in (55.9 cm). Autumn weather in North Dakota is largely the reverse of spring weather. The jet stream, which tends to weaken in summer, begins to re-strengthen, leading to a quicker changing of weather patterns and an increased variability of temperatures. By late October and November these storm systems become strong enough to form major winter storms. Fall and spring are the windiest times of the year in North Dakota.  2017 drought  As of September 2017, the United States Drought Monitor recorded abnormally dryweather conditions across the entire state. The drought is considered severe and unprecedented, and because of its nature as a \\"unpredictable, sudden event brought on by sustained high temperatures and little rain\\", it is considered a “flash drought”. North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring announced that predicted economic losses as a consequence from the drought could amount to as much as $4 billion or $5 billion.

Established in 1956, the studios were initially the primary recording studios for American record label Capitol Records. While they are still regularly used by Capitol recording artists, the studios began making the facility available to artists outside the label during the late 1960s to early 1970s. Capitol Studios is renowned for its impressive selection of vintage gear, microphones and state-of-the-art recording equipment, as well as their eight subterranean echo chambers. The studios are owned by Vivendi, the parent company of Universal Music Group, which in turn is the parent company of Capitol Music Group. For over 60 years, Capitol Studios has hosted some of the most celebrated artists, from Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Michael Jackson, and Dean Martin to Barbra Streisand, Paul McCartney, and the Beach Boys. Along with traditional recording sessions, the studios have been the location for numerous iTunes, Sirius/XM sessions, CMG Productions such as: Top of the Tower concerts and 1 Mic 1 Take Series. The Studios have also hosted music video shoots (Justin Timberlake's \\"Suit & Tie\\"), TV/Documentaries Behind the Music, Classic Albums, PBS Specials, Showtime Original Lost Songs: The Basement Tapes Continued and HBO feature If You're Not In The Obit, Eat Breakfast as well as feature shoots (Ray, Sandy Wexler). The studio has hosted \\"The Oscars\\" for the past two decades for the orchestra pre-records and hosts dozens of branded experiential and playback events each year. Overview The ground floor, the only rectangular part of the circular building, includes Studio A, was remodeled by Jeff Cooper in 1989. In 1990, a retractable wall was installed between Studio A and Studio B enabling them to be joined together to accommodate up to 75 musicians for the recording of orchestral and soundtrack music. Studio B was designed by Jack Edwards and Studio C was remodeled by Vincent Van Haaff. In additional to recording space, the first floor includes two mastering rooms and the studios' offices. The second floor, referred to internally as T2, includes Studio D as well as three additional mastering rooms. The Studios Studio A is the largest recording space. Originally built in 1956, Studio A has more than 2700 square feet of floor space. Often used for orchestral sessions, Studio A holds up to 50 musicians and has been utilized by everyone from Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole to Imagine Dragons and Michael Buble. In 2012, the studio was outfitted with a Neve 88RS recording console. Studio A has a variable decay time that can be tailored to artists needs by adjusting the louvered wall panels. Additionally, the studio features two isolation booths. Artists in need of a piano for their recording session can choose between a Yamaha C9 and a New York Steinway \\"B\\". The studio also features a large private artist lounge located above the control room. Studio B has a long list of legendary albums that were recorded there over the years, including projects from Green Day and Bob Dylan to Neil Young and John Mayer. Often touted in the industry as the classic rock and roll studio with one of the best sounding drum rooms, it is also sonically responsive enough to handle orchestra sessions. The control room features a vintage Neve 8068 56 input recording console. The room is designed for adjustable decay times, has one 154 square foot isolation booth and a recently renovated private artist lounge that overlooks the studio. The studio has a New York Steinway \\"B\\" (used by Nat King Cole) and Yamaha C9 for studio clients in need of a piano. Studio B contains 1023 square feet of floor space. Studio C, a large, fully scalable mixing suite, has been the site of multiple Grammy winning mixes over the years. Along with jazz, pop and rock, the room is often used to mix music scores for feature films such as Across The Universe (film), True Lies, The Revenant (2015 film), Independence Day: Resurgence and Chips. Studio C has a full array of outboard gear, surround capabilities and a large format Neve 72 input 88R console, outfitted with Encore Automation system and full surround monitoring scoring formats.

Located 30 feet underground, the trapezoidal rooms can be accessed by the studios and mastering rooms to add rich reverberation to a vocal. Each of the chambers has thick concrete walls and ceilings. Sound from the studio is sent to speakers in the echo chambers, which is then picked up by microphones and returned to the recording media. With speakers on one side and microphones on the other, the chambers can provide reverberation lasting up to 5 seconds. Mastering: The Craft Capitol Studios also features an on-site mastering department with five dedicated mastering rooms and two Neumann lathes used to cut lacquer for vinyl. Their team also has access to the legendary echo chambers, analog tape machines and digital technology, as well as proprietary custom-built gear, handmade in-house by Capitol's technical and engineering staff. Artists like Pink Floyd, the Bee Gees, the Beach Boys, R.E.M., Deep Purple, Glass Animals, N.W.A., Red Hot Chili Peppers, Miley Cyrus, and Selena Gomez have all had projects mastered at Capitol Studios. Vinyl mastering Vinyl mastering is a specific craft. The characteristics of the format require the engineer to pay particular attention to decision that precede the cutting process related to the mix, EQ, compression, and timing. Capitol Studios mastering department includes two vintage Neumann lathes used to cut lacquer in all formats including 7\\", 10\\" and 12\\". Their vintage lathes have been used to cut such notable albums as Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, the Bee Gees' Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack), Paul McCartney's Band on the Run, George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band, Ringo Starr's album Ringo 2012, and Boston's debut studio album Boston. For the last 27 years, Paula Salvatore, Vice President of Capitol Studios, has managed the studios. Arthur Kelm is the VP/General Manager and Chief Engineer and Patrick Kraus, from Universal Music Group, is the SVP, Head of Studio, Production and Archive Services. Recording activity at the studios could become hampered by the proposed construction of a nearby condominium building and underground parking lot, which would involve heavy equipment working within 18 feet of the underground chambers.Pool, Bob - Plan to build next to Capitol Records studios sounds just awful to music biz.

He remains engaged with the profession to the present day. Early life Bertel was born on January 6, 1931, at Bronx Maternity Hospital on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx borough of New York, New York to Meta Katherina \\"Martha / Mattie\\" (née Delvanthal) Bertelmann, the daughter of German immigrants living in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, and Heinrich \\"Henry\\" Bertelmann, who emigrated to the United States from Hemmoor, Germany, in 1909, disembarking from the steamship President Lincoln at Ellis Island. (He was naturalized in 1933.) Richard's only sibling was their son Henry John \\"Harry\\" Bertelmann, a U.S. Army veteran of World War II. Mattie claimed that as Richard first learned to talk, he would frequently babble a version of \\"W-E-A-F New York,\\" the hourly legal identification of one of the most prominent stations in New York City at that time. During his early childhood, family and friends called him \\"Richie.\\" While growing up in the Wakefield section of the Bronx, he attended Public School 87 and P.S. 68. Henry and Mattie legally separated in 1936 and were officially divorced in 1939. In 1940, Mattie married James Morton \\"Jim\\" Latz, a draftsman and veteran of World War I, who by this time had already become Richie's primary father figure. The family moved to nearby Darien, Connecticu, in 1944 when Jim was hired to manage the Marchand medicine cabinet factory in Stamford, Conn. which had been converted into a war plant. Before meeting his new classmates at Hollow Tree Ridge Junior High School (Middlesex Middle School today), he decided to introduce himself as \\"Dick\\" rather than \\"Richie.\\" From this point forward, he was always known socially as \\"Dick.\\" After one year at Hollow Tree Ridge, he attended Darien High School as a member of the Class of 1948. In 1947, he was elected Homecoming King. Early Career During the years 1948 - 1955, Bertel's career began at Fairfield County radio stations in the New York suburbs surrounding Darien and strung along the Boston Post Road corridor. Three forces shaped the American broadcasting industry as Bertel gathered his early experience with it. * The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lifted its wartime ban on issuing licenses, causing new stations to proliferate across the United States, especially in small cities and towns. * The explosive growth of commercial television was causing the radio networks to reduce their programming. This in turn increased the need for local stations to produce their own shows. In addition, TV was creating new job opportunities for broadcasters. * Despite their superior audio fidelity, FM stations were struggling to find audiences. In 1945, existing FM stations had been rendered obsolete when the FCC reassigned their portion of the spectrum (then between 42 and 50 MHz) to VHF television stations. Meanwhile, postwar consumers were more interested in purchasing television sets than radios with receivers that could be tuned to the new FM band (the current 88 to 108 MHz). This limited the interest of most operators in seeking FM licenses and increased the risk of investing in innovative FM programming, thus compounding the problem of low consumer interest in buying radios with FM receivers. As a result of this cycle, AM stations would continue to dominate radio listening for the next three decades. =WNLK in Norwalk= In April 1948, shortly before graduating from high school, Bertel requested a tour of WNLK, a new daytime-only radio station being built in neighboring Norwalk, Conn., and was offered an unpaid position. Initially writing and announcing news from his school, within a few months he was hosting The Hi Teen Show, a weekly Saturday morning program featuring local amateur singers, a band, and sketches performed by teenagers. To accommodate his work at WGCH (described below), in 1949 WNLK moved his shift to Sunday. When the station was granted a full-time license in the summer of that year, he was placed on the WNLK payroll. Bertel also performed with and announced for the Community Radio Workshop, a group of local hobbyist actors who produced a program on WNLK called The Mystery Theater of the Air and who also appeared in community stage productions. In 1950, WNLK broadcast a supernatural drama called \\"The House of Retribution\\" which Bertel wrote for the show. He remained at WNLK until 1951 when he accepted a Sunday shift at WNAB in Bridgeport (described below). =New York University= From September 1948 to June 1952 he concurrently commuted from Darien to Manhattan on the New Haven Railroad to earn a degree in broadcasting from New York University (NYU). One of his instructors there was Brad Phillips who had just started what would become a forty-four year career as a news anchor on WINS Radio in New York. (On Election Night in 1948 Phillips would stay on the air for twenty-three straight hours covering the surprising results of the presidential race between President Harry S. Truman and Governor Thomas E. Dewey.) =WGCH (FM) in Greenwich= In the Fall of 1948, testing began on a new New York television station, WOR-TV (WWOR today). While attempting to tune in a test pattern, Bertel instead found an unrelated audio broadcast. It was a test of an experimental FM station in Greenwich, Conn., WGCH (WFOX today), which due to a harmonic could be heard on the audio carrier of channel 9. Bertel responded to an announcer's invitation to listeners to call the station to report reception. Within a couple of weeks he decided to use that telephone conversation as a reason to visit the station and introduce himself. During that visit, he offered to volunteer as an announcer. By January 1949, he was hosting The Teen Turntable on WGCH on Saturday afternoons, working for free to gain experience just as he was presently doing at WNLK. After hosting The Hi Teen Show on WNLK in the morning, he would take a bus to Greenwich carrying a case of his personal collection of 78 RPM records for use on his WGCH show. Within weeks, WGCH offered him an announcing shift on Thursday and Friday afternoons and all day Saturday as well as $18 per week, making this his first paid position. On Saturday nights he hosted a listener call-in show called Request Party and co-hosted Jazz Cavalcade with a local record collector, Bill Gray. On Sundays he hosted a music show called Rhythm and Song. In the Summer of 1949, Bertel was made the acting program director at WGCH, covering for program director Jack Hines during his hospitalization for pneumonia and the recovery that followed. In 1950, Bertel hosted a Christmas broadcast featuring music conducted by Erich Kunzel, then a student at Greenwich High School, who would become known as the \\"Prince of Pops\\" during an illustrious career leading the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. Bertel continued to work at WGCH until he graduated from NYU in 1952. By that time, however, struggling to find an audience and advertisers on the FM band, WGCH was only broadcasting for 3 1/2 hours per day. At the end of that year, it ceased operations altogether. =WNAB in Bridgeport= While continuing his work at WGCH, in 1951 Bertel left WNLK to begin working Sundays at WNAB (WCUM today), the ABC affiliate in Bridgeport, Conn., where a friend he had made at WNLK, Bill Edwardsen, was now the chief announcer. (Edwardsen would become a fixture in the Albany - Schenectady - Troy, N.Y. market, primarily on WGY Radio and WRGB Television.) When he graduated from NYU in 1952, he was hired for the daily night shift, his first full-time position. Although he would continue to host The Saturday Night Dance Party, soon he was moved to the midday shift and was appointed to be the continuity director, writing all of the commercial copy for the station. He left WNAB in 1954 to work for WSTC (described below). On Sunday nights, WNAB broadcast live performances of big bands appearing at the Ritz Ballroom in Bridgeport. Bertel participated as an announcer, receiving his first professional experience working with celebrities. In this capacity, he interviewed famous musicians including Billy May, Lionel Hampton, Louis Armstrong, Charlie Spivak, Lou Monte, Don Cornell, Ralph Flanagan, and Steve Lawrence. =WSTC in Stamford= When Bertel and his family first moved to Darien in 1944, he began listening to WSRR in Stamford, an affiliate of NBC's Blue Network [which would become the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1945]. Intrigued that this radio station was broadcasting within a few miles of his new home, Bertel and one of his Hollow Tree Ridge Junior High School classmates visited the station and asked for a tour. The announcer on duty graciously showed them the operation and allowed them to stand silently in the studio while he conducted a record show. Bertel resolved then that he would one day come to work for that station which would change its call letters to WSTC in 1946. In 1954, WSTC hired him for the night shift, delivering the eleven o'clock newscast and conducting station breaks around network shows such as The Lone Ranger. Other members of the staff included Scott Vincent (who would become a staff announcer for ABC), Jerry Damon (who would become a staff announcer for NBC), and Dee Caruso (who would become a TV writer and producer for Get Smart, The Monkees, and The Smothers Brothers Show). Up until now, he had been using his name \\"Dick Bertelmann\\" on WNLK, WGCH, and WNAB. Other announcers at WSTC used stage names so he decided it was time to coin one for himself. At WSTC he started calling himself \\"Dick Richards.\\" One night in September 1954, one of Bertel's colleagues conceived a plan for them to meet women working as nurses in residence at Stamford Hospital. He would call a dormitory on the hospital's campus under the pretense of being a producer seeking requests for records to be played on The Dick Richards Show, then ask the nurse on the phone if she and her friends would like to meet Dick Richards and his coworkers at a pizzeria. That led to Bertel's courtship with Jean Thies, a native of Dunkirk / Fredonia, N.Y., and their marriage in November 1955. =Move to Hartford, Conn.= Engaged to be married and contemplating how to best position his career to support a family, Bertel decided in 1955 that he needed to move to a new, larger market. In 1955, the Bridgeport - Stamford - Norwalk market ranked 31st in the U.S. Although not small, it was over-shadowed by nearby New York, the largest market in the country, and the powerhouse stations that operated there. Looking seventy-five miles away to Connecticut's capital city, Bertel resolved that he would find a new job in the Hartford - New Britain market, then ranked 27th nationally. Situated nearly equidistant between New York and the Boston, Mass. - Manchester, N.H. market (then ranked 6th in the U.S.) and yet completely independent of both, Hartford offered the opportunity to build a reputation that could easily be transferred to a major market at a later time. A highly affluent and particularly well-educated area, it was also an important test market for advertisers and therefore a richly profitable location for broadcasters. Plus it was the home of WTIC Radio, one of the most prestigious broadcast operations in the country. =WGTH Radio= In July 1955, Bertel visited most of the major radio stations in Hartford including WTIC. In the early autumn, he accepted a job at WGTH Radio (WPOP today). His first assignments included weekend work. On Saturdays he hosted a live children's talent show from the Brown Thomson department store in Hartford. On Sundays when the station would carry local foreign language programming, he would run the equipment for those amateur hosts. In December he played the master of ceremonies for The Christmas Carol Sing, an event organized by The Hartford Times newspaper, and announced the program on WGTH. A tradition for many years, more than ten thousand people would gather outside the Hartford Times Building to join a choir singing Christmas carols and other holiday songs. Turnover was rampant at WGTH. As a result, within weeks Bertel, who was still using the \\"Dick Richards\\" air-name that he had created for himself at WSTC in Stamford, had become the senior announcer. As such, he hosted The Uprising, the daily morning show. At midday he co-hosted Luncheon with Dottie and Dick with the station's women's director, Dottie Coleman, who usually referred to him as \\"Richard\\" on the program. Besides the regional Yankee Network, WGTH was both an ABC and a Mutual affiliate. When the Mutual network comedy team Bob and Ray broadcast their show nationally from the Hartford State Armory, Bertel performed as their announcer. Similarly when the Mutual news commentator Cedric Foster (the former manager of WTHT, a predecessor to WGTH) broadcast his network show from WGTH, Bertel read his intro and several public service announcements. WTIC Radio under the Travelers Insurance Company When Bertel first arrived in Hartford, WTIC was still owned by the Travelers Insurance Company, the company that founded it in 1925, and located in its original studios at 26 Grove Street. (The road was renamed “Bob Steele Street” in 2003.) In 1961, WTIC relocated to its custom-built, state-of-the-art Broadcast House building on Constitution Plaza. In 1964, Constitution Plaza Inc. and the Travelers Broadcasting Service merged to form Broadcast-Plaza Inc., which continued to operate as a Travelers subsidiary until the insurance behemoth sold the stations in 1974. Arrival In April 1956, Bertel learned WTIC had an opening on its announcing staff. He called the chief announcer and auditions manager, Fred Wade, and asked for an interview. During his first audition, Bertel shared Studio F (which looked more like a living room than a radio studio) with Ross Miller, \\"Ross the Musical Boss,\\" the host of Juke Box Jingles [sic], who was asked to read the same scripts as Bertel to contrast his delivery. They worked together again a couple of weeks later in Studio C, a small audience participation room, when Wade asked Bertel to return to audition for the program manager, Leonard J. Patricelli. At the end of that visit, Bertel was introduced to Paul W. Morency, the president and general manager of WTIC. Bertel’s first day of work at WTIC was May 13, 1956. One of his first assignments was to serve as the announcer for Medley Time, a program of live organ music played by Hal Kolb. Becoming \\"Dick Bertel\\" There was one condition on his employment, however: He could no longer call himself \\"Dick Richards.\\" WTIC wanted to avoid any confusion with another announcer, Floyd Richards, who had been on the staff since 1943. Because \\"Bertelmann\\" (pronounced \\"BURT’l’min\\") sounds muddled, Wade proposed that he call himself \\"Bertel\\" (pronounced \\"burr’TELL\\") instead. Although he would always use Bertelmann in his private life, he would forevermore be known professionally as \\"Dick Bertel.\\" =Staff Announcer= Besides Ross Miller, Floyd Richards, and Fred Wade, Bertel joined an announcing staff that included Ed Anderson, Bob Arel, Frank Atwood, Jean Colbert, Bruce Kern, Paul Lucas, Bob Steele, and Bob Tyrol. Over Bertel's twenty-one year tenure other staff announcers would include Bill Clede, Bill Corsair, Brad Davis, Arnold Dean, George Ehrlich, John Elliott, Bob Ellsworth, Joe Girand, Bill Hanson, Bill Hennessey, Bill Henry, Art Johnson, Lani Jurev, George Malcolm-Smith, Bob Nelson, Mike Ogden, Lou Palmer, Norm Peters, Ray Rice, Robert E. Smith, John Stevens, Al Terzi, Jim Thompson, Doug Webster, Dana Whalen, and Jerry Williams. Staff announcers read commercials, issued station breaks, and delivered newscasts. The staff announcers would read newscasts prepared by the newsroom, often fifteen minutes in length with no breaks, not even for actualities or commercials. =Program Host= Regarded as one of WTIC's most versatile announcers and best interviewers, Bertel hosted many programs during his tenure at WTIC. Conversation Piece From 1956 to 1969, Bertel hosted Conversation Piece, a half-hour program he conceived and produced that was broadcast each weekday at 7:00 p.m. It was built mainly on intriguing stories provided weekly by the script service A.P.S. Inc. Examples are how President Abraham Lincoln considered the number 13 to be his lucky number, a theory that Napoleon Bonaparte may have been murdered, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's report to the nation on the Space Race. The theme song was \\"No Strings Attached\\" performed by Richard Hayman and his Orchestra, over which Bertel read this introduction: \\"And a very pleasant good evening to you, this is Dick Bertel welcoming you to Conversation Piece, featuring facts and figures about the world we live in, a touch of music on records, plus strange and unusual stories of actual happenings.\\" Americana In 1962, Bertel assumed hosting duties of Americana, a ninety-minute interview program with a patriotic tilt that aired daily at 2:00 p.m. Guests would discuss historical subjects, current events, and cultural traditions from around the nation although stories with connections to Connecticut and its neighbors were most prominent. Typically, these discussions were prerecorded in one session and segmented so that they could be stripped across the entire week. Occasionally, they would be recorded on-location such as the cab of a steam locomotive on the Valley Railroad in Essex, Conn., a riverboat on the Connecticut River with a live jazz band, and Thanksgiving on the grounds of Old Sturbridge Village. Christmas Eve Shows A tradition from 1962 to 1976, Bertel hosted an hour-long program of holiday music at 8:00 p.m. each Christmas Eve. Beginning in 1964, he included his children Darcy (born 1959), Jim (b. 1961), Susan (b. 1967), and Doug (b. 1971) in the dialogue. Many times the shows incorporated guests such as illustrator and painter Norman Rockwell, Sleigh Ride and Christmas Festival composer Leroy Anderson; Virginia O’Hanlon Douglas, the inspiration for Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus; opera star and civil rights icon Marian Anderson; and Johnny Marks, the composer of Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer. Saturday Showcase From 1967 to 1969, Bertel hosted Saturday Showcase which was modeled after the Sunday Showcase program that Arnold Dean had anchored since starting at WTIC in 1965. It was a music program that usually spotlighted the catalogue of a particular performer or group. It included features provided by Jean Colbert, the director of women’s programs, and Bill Clede, the outdoors editor. ‘TIC Afternoon Edition In 1968, Bertel was directed to take over the ‘TIC Afternoon Edition from 3:00 to 7:00 p.m. which, after a long period of being the dominant afternoon show in the market, had plummeted in popularity. For the first time, he introduced current rock music (that complemented the station’s usual middle-of-the-road selections) into the playlist. The show returned to number one within the first ratings period. WTIC Anniversary Shows Every year Bertel would anchor a retrospective program to mark the anniversary of WTIC’s first broadcast on February 10, 1925. The title was usually styled like “The Broadcaster at Forty” as it was in 1965 for example. The Golden Age of Radio The Broadcaster anniversary shows attracted the interest of a particular listener, Ed Corcoran, a computer programmer who had compiled a massive collection of early network radio shows that he had recorded himself off the air. After Corcoran introduced himself to Bertel, he frequently appeared as a guest on one of Bertel's various programs to share his collection. In 1970, together they created and hosted The Golden Age of Radio, a monthly program featuring interviews with radio actors, writers, musicians, producers, and engineers primarily from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s who would comment on clips culled from Corcoran’s collection. It continued until Bertel left the station in 1977 and yielded one of the most extensive oral histories of that singular era in American media and entertainment. Vincent Price, Don Ameche, Rudy Vallée, Mason Adams, Ruby Keeler, and Joan Fontaine are just a few examples of the notable people who appeared on this show. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, The Golden Age of Radio interviews were regularly incorporated into The Big Broadcast, a weekly compilation of recordings from radio's golden age on WAMU in Washington, D.C., the public radio station owned and operated by American University, which was then hosted by Ed Walker. The SiriusXM Radio Classics channel will still occasionally play excerpts from these interviews. Special Programs Bertel was frequently assigned to host specials that WTIC Radio would produce, particularly its coverage of the Space Race. In one particularly memorable broadcast, he led a program from the Springfield (Mass.) Science Museum to report on the spacecraft Mariner 4 transmitting pictures of the surface of Mars. The program made broadcast history because the studio-to-transmitter link was partially conducted on a laser beam engineered by the PerkinElmer corporation. WTIC-FM During the period that Bertel worked at WTIC, WTIC-FM simulcast WTIC (AM) much of the time, but would break away for its own classical music programs. Like many of the other staff announcers, Bertel worked shifts on WTIC-FM as a classical music host. =Breaking News= As a member of the Special Events team, Bertel would anchor, report on, and otherwise contribute to breaking news coverage of crippling weather events, power blackouts, and other emergencies such as the deadly 1961 Hartford Hospital fire. These events included two of the three major assassinations of American public figures during the 1960s. The Assassination of President Kennedy The news that President John F. Kennedy had been wounded by an assassin broke into the final minutes of Mikeline on WTIC Radio which was being hosted on Friday, November 22, 1963 by Floyd Richards and Bob Ellsworth. After the standard NBC five minute newscast at 2:00 p.m. EST ended, Bertel assumed anchoring duties at the direction of producer Bill Marks. Bertel interrupted music selections with news updates from the wire services until NBC finally began providing its radio affiliates with continuous coverage at 2:11 p.m. Throughout the weekend that followed, Bertel anchored the major newscasts on Channel 3, the only local content Channel 3 broadcast until the day following the president's funeral. The Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Just as he was concluding his Conversation Piece program on WTIC Radio at 7:30 p.m. EST on April 4, 1968, Bertel was handed a bulletin, which he read while transitioning to a newscast, announcing that civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King had been shot in Memphis, Tenn. Later that evening, he anchored the 11 o'clock newscast on Channel 3 which was dominated by assassination-related demonstrations in Hartford's North End neighborhood. WTIC-TV, Channel 3 From its founding in 1957 until it was sold in 1974, Bertel anchored newscasts and hosted public affairs shows on WTIC-TV, Channel 3 (WFSB today). WKSS Radio From 1978 to 1984, Bertel managed WKSS, a \\"beautiful music\\" radio station in Hartford. He was also the host of the morning show, Good Morning, New England. Voice of America In 1984, Bertel moved to the Washington, D.C. area where he became the executive producer for the Voice of America. From 1991 to 1993, Bertel worked for two years in Munich, Germany managing affiliate relations for VOA Europe, the Voice of America's pop music service aimed at European listeners. Returning to Washington, he created Talk to America, an international call-in show. WTOP Radio From 1986 to 1989, Bertel worked as an anchor on the all- news radio station in Washington, D.C., WTOP. NBC and Mutual Broadcasting System From 1988 to 1991, Bertel worked as an anchor on NBC Radio Network and the Mutual Broadcasting System, both owned and operated by Westwood One. Retirement Having recently retired from Voice of America, Bertel now resides in a Maryland suburb of Washington, D.C. He regularly volunteers to help non-native speakers of English achieve conversational competency.

It has smooth bark, a crown consisting of unusually small, juvenile leaves, flower buds in groups of three, white flowers and hemispherical fruit. It is only known from six extremely old multi-stemmed individual plants and is classed as \\"critically endangered\\". Description Eucalyptus recurva is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey, orange, green or yellow bark that is shed in long ribbons. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, elliptical to egg-shaped leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs, each leaf long and wide. The crown of mature trees is composed of juvenile leaves that are paler on the lower surface, up to long and wide with the tip turned down. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on very short pedicels. Mature buds are broadly oval and wrinkled, long and wide with a rounded operculum that is shorter and narrower than the floral cup at the join. Flowering occurs in a short period in January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding. The remaining wild specimens are thought to be extremely old. Based on the size of its lignotuber, the largest single specimen is estimated to be 3,000 years old, given that its lignotuber grows at only 2mm per year. However, it is possible that two other specimens are actually the result of a split in the original rootstock, and based on their spread of 26m would be estimated at around 13,000 years old, which if correct would make it the oldest single tree known to be alive on earth. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus recurva was first formally described in 1988 by Michael Crisp from material collected near Braidwood. The species was discovered by \\"Ms. R. Jean, a landholder from near Braidwood\\" who first brought specimens to the Australian National Botanic Gardens in August 1985. The specific epithet (recurva) is a Latin word meaning \\"curved backwards\\", referring to the conspicuously recurved leaves of this mallee.  Distribution and habitat  Mongarlowe mallee is found on sloping sites in low heathland and at the margins of the heathland and low woodland. It is only known from six individual plants growing at four sites near Mongarlowe and Windellama. Conservation status This mallee is classed as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The main threat to the species is visitation pressure, including collection of plant material, soil compaction and damage by vehicles.

A school teacher and headmaster during his professional career, he served in Stavanger city council from 1922 to 1964 and three terms in the Norwegian Parliament; during one of these terms he was President of the Storting. He made his mark in language politics. Early life and education He was born in Stavanger as a son of sailmaker Johan Pedersen (1857–1941) and his wife Johanne Christine Natvig (1863–1940). He briefly attended the Norwegian Military Academy, but graduated with the cand.philol. degree in 1919. In the same year he was hired as a school teacher in Stavanger. He was also a standing military officer, and held the rank Premier Lieutenant from 1920. Political career He was elected to Stavanger city council for the first time in 1922, and was re- elected successively throughout the rest of the interwar period. He chaired his local party chapter from 1925 to 1926 and 1935 to 1936, and was a member of the Labour Party national board from 1936 to 1939. From 1926 to 1928 he was a member of the city school board. He was also board chairman of the local party newspaper Den 1ste Mai from 1927 to 1936. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament from the Market towns of Vest-Agder and Rogaland counties in 1936. Among the political cases during this period, Natvig-Pedersen made a mark in the language issue. He was one of the people behind the orthographic reform of 1938, which implemented a converge between Nynorsk and Bokmål. He issued the orthographic dictionary Norsk rettskrivingsordliste in 1938 together with August Lange; the book was reprinted ten times. In the next year, Natvig-Pedersen followed with a textbook in Norwegian Bokmål. He later served as a member of the Norwegian Language Committee from 1953 to 1962, and in 1959 he issued a new version of Norsk rettskrivingsordliste together with Kjølv Egeland. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, he was imprisoned by the Nazis. He was first arrested in March 1942 for boycotting the Nazi creation, the Teachers Union, together with a large number of other teachers, including Kjell Bondevik. He sat at Grini for one day, later at Jørstadmoen and Kirkenes. He was then released, only to be arrested again on 8 March 1943. He was imprisoned at Grini later that month, and in May he was transferred to Sachsenhausen. After the liberation he returned to his teaching job, the Norwegian Parliament and Stavanger city council.

The name is derived from the Greek eu, beautiful, and krossos, a fringe, referring to the long stamens. The genus contains eight species. Phaedranassa and Rauhia are the genera most closely related to Eucrosia. Description All the members of the genus are bulbous. The leaves are deciduous, with characteristic long petioles and elliptical or ovate blades (laminae), up to 25 cm wide; they may or may not be present when the flowers are produced. The inflorescence is an umbel of 6–30 weakly to strongly zygomorphic flowers, tubular at the base, green, yellow or red in colour. The stamens hang downwards (i.e. are declinate) and have long filaments which in most species form a cup containing nectaries at the base. The flowers are assumed to be adapted for butterfly pollination, although there is one report of a hummingbird visiting E. eucrosioides. The fruit is a capsule with three locules; the seeds are flattened and winged. The diploid chromosome number is most commonly 2n=46. Species , the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepts eight species of Eucrosia: *Eucrosia aurantiaca (Baker) Traub – Southern central Ecuador *Eucrosia bicolor Ker Gawl. – Ecuador to Peru *Eucrosia calendulina Meerow & Sagást. – Peru *Eucrosia dodsonii Meerow & Dehgan – Ecuador *Eucrosia eucrosioides (Herb.) Pax – South western Ecuador to Northern Peru *Eucrosia mirabilis (Baker) Traub – Peru, Ecuador *Eucrosia stricklandii (Baker) Meerow – Ecuador *Eucrosia tubiflora Meerow – Peru Distribution and habitat Eucrosia is restricted to the central Andes of Ecuador and Peru. All of the species are found only in small areas or as small numbers of individuals. Three species are endemic to Ecuador, two to Peru. Three further species are only occasionally found in Peru, being primarily distributed in Ecuador. All but one species of Eucrosia are adapted to seasonally dry habitats, found on the lower, Pacific-facing slopes of the Andes and the adjacent lowlands. The exception is E. dodsonii, which grows in the understory of montane rainforest. Cultivation In cultivation, all species except the rainforest dweller E. dobsonii can be grown in pots in gritty soil in good light, being kept warm and dry when the leaves wither, and watered when the flowers or leaves begin to grow again. E. dobsonii needs shadier conditions and a more open growing medium. Only E. bicolor is widely grown.

Photo: Byhistorisk samling, Oslo Museum. Jakob Johan Sigfrid Friis (27 April 1883 - 12 December 1956) was a Norwegian politician newspaper editor, and historian for the Labour Party and later the Communist Party of Norway born in Røros. Outside politics he graduated with the cand.philol. degree in history in 1909, and spent his professional career as a journalist and a state archivist. He was a journalist in Socialdemokraten from 1909 to 1912, Ny Tid from 1915 to 1917, Arbeiderbladet from 1917 to 1924 and Norges Kommunistblad from 1928 to 1929. Upon the suggestion from Martin Tranmæl, he became editor- in-chief of Rjukan Arbeiderblad from 1925 to 1928 and the working class encyclopedia Arbeidernes Leksikon from 1930 to 1936. As a state archivist he worked in the National Archives (Riksarkivet) from 1912 to 1915, followed by the regional state archives: in Trondhjem 1915-1917, Kristiania 1917-1922 and Kristiansand 1934-1953. On the local level Friis was a member of Aker municipal council between 1919 and 1922, and of Kristiansand city council between 1937 and 1940. He chaired the municipal party chapter from 1936 to 1937. Friis represented the Labour Party at the Second and Third Comintern World Congresses; he was also a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International from 1920 to 1921. In 1923, Friis supported Martin Tranmæl and withdrawal of the Labour Party from the Comintern. This saw the Communist Party break away from the Labour Party. However, Friis became a Communist Party member in 1928. He left the party in 1933, and rejoined Labour in 1936. Friis opposed the asylum for Leon Trotsky to come to Norway in 1935 and campaigned against the former Bolshevik leader when he lived in Norway in several newspaper articles and a pamphlet. After World War II Friis was elected to the Parliament of Norway from the Market towns of Vest-Agder and Rogaland counties in 1945, and was re-elected after his first period by an overwhelming majority. He was still to be found on the left wing of the Labour Party, and was the original editor of the newspaper Orientering in 1952, having published the book Kritikk av norsk utenrikspolitikk etter krigen in 1952. He was one of its chief editors until his death in 1956.

Created in February 1941 by former members of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) of the neosocialist tendency and led by Marcel Déat, the party was heavily influenced by fascism and saw the circumstances of the occupation as an opportunity to revolutionarise France. February–October 1941: the RNP-MNR period Marcel Déat, a neosocialist expelled from the SFIO in November 1933 and former Minister, first proposed to create a single state party during the 1940 summer, immediately following the proclamation of the Vichy regime. Briefly arrested by the French police on 13 December 1940, he finally created the RNP in February 1941, which became one of the primary collaborationist parties, along with Jacques Doriot's French Popular Party (PPF), Marcel Bucard's Francisme and Pierre Clémenti's French National- Collectivist Party. Immediately, the German authorities imposed a fusion between Marcel Déat's RNP and the far-right Social Revolutionary Movement (MSR) of Eugène Deloncle, an inheritor of the Cagoule terrorist group The first committee of direction of the RNP-MSR was composed of two RNP members and three MSR members: Marcel Déat, Jean Fontenoy, Jean Van Ormelingen (alias Jean Vanor), Eugène Deloncle and Jean Goy. However, the fusion between the RNP and the MSR was a failure, in part because Déat's RNP recruited mainly among former members of the French Left while the MSR was from the beginning located on the far-right of the political spectrum. The MSR conserved de facto its autonomy inside the RNP and was mainly charged of forming the RNP's security service. After the assassination attempt of Paul Collette against Pierre Laval, Marshal Philippe Pétain's Prime Minister and Marcel Déat on 27 August 1941, the latter accused the MSR of having attempted to eliminate him. Thereafter, the MSR was excluded from the RNP in October 1941, leading to the reorganization of the RNP (and exclusion of elements close to the MSR) until the first months of 1942. The RNP without the MSR (after October 1941) The ideology of the RNP was clearly of a fascist nature, advocating antisemitic and racist policies and sharing a strong admiration for Nazi Germany. Despite this, it differed from Jacques Doriot's French Popular Party (PPF) in that it maintained the principle of universal suffrage, public education, anti- clericalism or the conservation of sculptures of Marianne, a republican symbol, in the townhalls.Pascal Ory. Les collaborateurs. Those ideas created constant conflicts between the RNP and more reactionary elements of Vichy who also supported the Révolution nationale (\\"National Revolution\\") and had been trained in the Action française monarchist movement. On a tactic level, the RNP supported Pierre Laval and criticized the \\"Vichy reactionaries\\" and the PPF. Marcel Déat maintained close links with the German ambassador in Paris, Otto Abetz, whilst Doriot turned himself towards the SS. After Laval's return to government in April 1942 and the Nazi occupation of the Southern Zone in November 1942, Déat focused all his efforts on creating a single party of the Collaboration which would permit him to impose himself as its sole leader. In November 1942, the leaders of the RNP, Déat and Georges Albertini, met with MSR leaders such as Georges Soulès. Following this meeting, the RNP created the National Revolutionary Front (Front révolutionnaire national, FRN) which gathered the main collaborationist parties, apart from Doriot's PPF. The FRN thus included the RNP-Labour Social Front, the MSR, the Parti franciste, the Groupe Collaboration, the Jeunes de l'Europe nouvelle and the Comité d’action antibolchévique (Anti-Bolshevik Action Committee). Déat furthermore managed to gain to his side the secretary of the PPF, Jean Fossati, and named to the head of the FRN Henri Barbé, issued from the PPF. However, the FRN finally was a failure. In March 1944, Déat was named Minister of Labour and of National Solidarity and took as assistants the RNP leaders (Georges Albertini, Georges Dumoulin, Ludovic Zoretti and Gabriel Lafaye) From then on, he focused more on his ministry tasks than on the organization of the RNP. On 17 August 1944, Déat took refuge in Nazi Germany almost alone. In charge of the youth organisation of the RNP, Roland Gaucher would also accompany Pétain into exile in the Sigmaringen enclave. Organisation of the RNP following October 1941 The RNP had at maximum 30,000 members.Le Marec-Lambert. According to the historian Robert Soucy, it had only 2,638 party members, of whom only 12.8 percent were industrial workers.David Carroll, Jaap Querido and Robert J. Soucy. \\"'France's Hollow Years': An Exchange\\". New York Review of Books. Volume 43. Number 13. 8 August 1996 . Its mouthpiece, directed by Roland Gaucher, was Le National Populaire, but the party was also supported by Déat's daily, L'Œuvre. The youth organisation (Jeunesses nationales populaires, JNP) was headed by Roland Silly, Roland Gaucher (future co-founder of the National Front in 1972) and eight other personalities. Primary members of the RNP (after October 1941) RNP members: Jean Fontenoy, Eugène Deloncle, Marcel Déat, Jean Goy and Jean Van Ormelingen.

She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction Brevard was laid down on 2 September 1944 at Richmond, California, by Kaiser Cargo Inc., under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 2109; launched on 18 November 1944; sponsored by Mrs. C.S. Wieringa, wife of the out-fitting superintendent at the builders' yard; delivered to the Navy and commissioned on 19 February 1945, Lieutenant Paul J. Wild, USNR, in command. Service history \\"In orderly procession,\\" Lt. Wild later wrote, \\"came 'Fitting-Out Availability' at Treasure Island, California, loading of stores and material at Oakland, California, two weeks of shakedown in San Pedro, California, and post-shakedown availability at San Pedro.\\" Following those post-commissioning details, Brevard loaded cargo at San Francisco, California, and put to sea for Hawaii on 8 April. =World War II Pacific Theatre operations= Brevard carried fleet freight, spare parts and equipment either consigned directly to operating units or to tenders in the forward areas for subsequent installation; she also carried tanks, trucks, and amphibious vehicles for Marine Corps' replacements, and ship's store stock. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on the 16th. She delivered cargo both at Pearl Harbor and at Hilo on the island of Hawaii before departing the islands on 1 May. Brevard reached Eniwetok on the 11th but departed again on the 13th. Her next stop was Guam where she remained from 17 May to 7 June. From there, she moved to Ulithi Atoll, in the Carolines, arriving on 8 June and staying until the 27th. She headed from Ulithi to the Palaus, where she paused between 29 June and 1 July. =End-of-war activity= Reaching Leyte on 2 July, Brevard spent the next seven weeks there, during which time hostilities with Japan ceased, allowing her commanding officer to observe later that \\"the ship neither encountered nor observed the enemy.\\" Departing Leyte on 19 August, Brevard steamed to Ulithi, where she stopped over from 24 August to 3 September, and to the Marianas, where she stayed from 5 to 18 September. The cargo ship returned to Leyte on 23 September and remained there almost a month. On 19 October, she left Leyte on her way to occupation duty in China. Brevard arrived in Chinese waters on 28 October and provided logistics support for the occupation troops. =Post-war return Stateside and decommissioning= On 22 January 1946, Brevard left Shanghai and sailed for the United States. On that day, beginning at 1520 Brevard crew rescued 4,296 Japanese civilian repatriots from the ship Enoshima Maru as it sank near Shanghai. Later called an incredible \\"act of humanity\\" by the Embassy of Japan, this rescue was completed by 1550—in less than 30 minutes—and is listed by Guinness for \\"Most people rescued at sea. (civilians)\\". [NOTE: Guinness has date wrong. 22 January 1946 is correct and taken directly from RESTRICTED copies of ship's record of this event.] She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 16 February to 2 March. She then continued her voyage to the west coast, reaching San Francisco, California, on 14 March. Although slated to proceed thence to Norfolk, Virginia, to be returned to the Maritime Commission and be laid up in the James River, Virginia, to relieve the workload of yards on the U.S. East Coast, Brevard received orders the next day to proceed instead to Olympia, Washington, where she was decommissioned and returned to the Maritime Commission on 3 July 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 8 October 1946, and she was sold into merchant service 17 March 1947. Final Disposition: she was scrapped in 1970.

History  These straits, formed between the large islands Banca and Billiton, are generally called Gaspar Straits, after the Spanish captain from Manila, who passed through them in 1724; but Captain Hurle, returning from China in the English ship Macclesfield, had previously passed through them, in March 1702. Pulo Leat, or Middle Island, separates these straits into two principal branches; that to the westward, between it and the S.E. part of Banca, is often called Macclesfield Strait; and the eastern branch, situated between Middle Island, and Long Island, near Billiton, is generally called Clements' Strait, after Captain Clements, who commanded the fleet from China, that went through this branch in July 1781. Gaspar Island, or Pulo Glassa, , lies approximately 24 miles north of Middle Island and approximately 18 miles from Tanjong Brekat . The largest islands in the strait are Lepar, Pongok and Mendanau.  Wreck discovery  In 1998, fishermen discovered a block of coral encrusted with pieces of ceramic, at the depth of about 16 meters. From a large jar they removed several bowls intact. These divers by chance had just made the greatest underwater archeological discovery ever made in Southeast Asia: a 9th-century Arab dhow, loaded with over 60,000 gold and silver objects, and manufactured ceramics under the Tang Dynasty. The boat and its cargo, dubbed Belitung shipwreck, testified that Tang China was producing mass-produced commercial items that it exported by sea. Arab sailors were clearly traveling along the maritime silk route, trading at a great scale and over long distances. The port of departure and the destination of the dhow are unknown. Most scholars believe dhow was heading to the Middle East, probably from Guangzhou (Canton), the largest port on the Silk Road. Many Arabs and Persians lived in Guangzhou in the 9th century. Among the tens of thousands of bowls found in the wreck, one bore this inscription: The sixteenth day of the seventh month of the second year of the reign of Baoli, or 826 apr. The mass- produced nature of the cargo and the geographical diversity of its production suggest that it was an export item made to order.

History  Rugby was supposedly introduced to Resolven by two visiting engineers; Charlie Thomas and Alf Morgan, in 1885. The Club first played at Tan-y- Rhiw, then the Brick Field, then in 1898 to Sardis field until moving again, this time to the Farmers Field. Between the World Wars rugby was played on the Drehir ground on which the club had managed to acquire a changing room and grandstand. During the Second World War the Drehir ground was used by the UK government to build a munitions factory. In 1945 this left Resolven RFC in the position of being members of the WRU but without a playing field. On 31 October 1946 a new ground at Tan-y-Rhiw field was opened on which Resolven play rugby to this day. Capt. J.N. Vaughan granted the use of the field and on 14 October 1954 the Vaughan family of Rheola donated the freehold of the property to Resolven Rugby Football Club. The field was renamed the Vaughan Rugby Ground in honour of their benefactor. In May 2006 Resolven RFC were one of the 13 'Rebel' clubs who brought a vote of no confidence against the WRU, which centered on financing and the handling of former coach Mike Ruddock's departure.

The Rowley Baronetcy, of Tendring Hall (Stoke-by-Nayland) in the County of Suffolk, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 27 June 1786 for the naval commander Rear- Admiral Joshua Rowley. He was the son of Admiral of the Fleet Sir William Rowley. The second Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Suffolk. The third Baronet was a Vice-Admiral of the Blue. The sixth Baronet was a colonel in the Army. The seventh Baronet served as Lord-Lieutenant of Suffolk between 1978 and 1994. He died in 1997. In 2002 his kinsman Sir Charles Robert Rowley, 7th Baronet, of Hill House (see below) established his claim to the title. The Rowley Baronetcy, of the Navy, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 2 November 1813 for the Anglo-Irish naval commander Sir Josias Rowley. He was the nephew of the first Baronet of the 1786 creation. Rowley never married and the title became extinct on his death in 1842. The Rowley Baronetcy, of Hill House in the County of Berkshire, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 21 March 1836 for the naval commander Admiral Charles Rowley. He was the fourth son of the first Baronet of the 1786 creation. The seventh Baronet established his claim to the 1786 baronetcy in 2002.

The effect can be sudden and dramatic because pontoon boats usually cannot rely on the righting effect of a keel (which contains ballast). The vessel is stable and self-righting up to the point that the centre of gravity shifts past the centre of buoyancy of the ship and the vessel rapidly capsizes. (The same term can also arise when describing a design in which the attributes of a pontoon are created without using explicit pontoons—when a design effectively incorporates pontoons. This page describes the specific phenomenon described above.) The pontoon effect is theoretically possible whenever the vessel's entire weight exceeds the buoyancy of the pontoon(s) on either side. However, the pontoon effect is more likely in vessels with a high center of gravity and low or non-existent displacement other than the pontoons. A pontoon vessel such as a catamaran floats in a level position when the center of gravity of the entire vessel (including its load) is above the center of buoyancy. This is the opposite of the case in a traditional or displacement hull vessel, which derives positive stability from having its center of buoyancy above the center of gravity. If the pontoon vessel tips, it will remain stable as long as the center of gravity does not move further to the side than the center of buoyancy is moved by the change in the depth (and displacement) of each pontoon. Under these conditions a \\"righting force\\" (a turning moment) acts on the vessel to push it back toward the level position. However, if the center of gravity is high relative to the width of the vessel, and the pontoons on one side are unable to bear the vessel's complete weight, the lateral movement of the center of buoyancy will be restricted. Even a relatively small lateral force can move the center of gravity further to the side than the center of buoyancy can go. At this point, the righting force will disappear, replaced by a turning moment in the opposite direction. This can capsize the vessel at the point at which one pontoon is completely submerged. When using twin lateral pontoons, each pontoon should have enough buoyancy to bear the load of the entire vessel on its own. If the vessel is so heavy that either pontoon is mostly submerged when no lateral force is applied, it will be vulnerable to the pontoon effect. If sufficient lateral force arises (such as wind or shifting load), the vessel can tip enough to submerge one pontoon. At this point, the sunken pontoon will provide no further buoyancy to right the vessel. As the center of buoyancy cannot move further to that side to match the center of gravity, that pontoon will continue sinking. The tipping angle will increase until the vessel capsizes. This can continue until the vessel inverts completely with the pontoons again floating on the surface but the rest of the vessel underwater. At this point, the upside-down vessel will be highly stable. If, on the other hand, the vessel is designed and loaded so that each pontoon can support the vessel's entire weight (plus any lateral forces that arise like wind), the center of gravity cannot move transversely beyond the center of buoyancy at the most extreme tipping angle, and the pontoon effect cannot occur. Note, however, that this is not the sole effect to be taken into consideration when assessing the likelihood of capsize. The change in hull windage as the vessel heels is also important. In the case of a trimaran designed for cruising, with solid wing decks (as opposed to racing-type designs with mesh or open wings), those with wide-beam floats able to support the whole weight of the vessel are more likely to capsize than those with narrow-beam floats of lesser buoyancy that can be submerged as the vessel heels. As the wide-beam float comes to take the entire weight of the heeling vessel, the centre hull lifts out of the water; this exposes the entire area of the underside of both wings to the wind, and also increases the turning moment of the wind force on the weather wing. There is now a considerable overturning force due to the wind and the vessel is very likely to capsize. In contrast, a trimaran with narrow-beam floats will simply submerge the lee float, exposing only the weather wing and that with a lesser moment. In practical sea situations the windage effect is greater than the buoyancy effect and so cruising trimarans with highly buoyant floats are more, not less, likely to capsize than those with less buoyant floats. A trimaran is best stabilised not by adding buoyancy on the lee float but adding weight to the weather float. This is the basis of the \\"cool-tubes\\" stability system invented by Tristan Jones and L. Surtees. A large-diameter pipe closed at the aft end is attached to the keel of each float and fills with water. While it remains submerged buoyancy forces cancel the weight of the trapped water and the weight of the tube is effectively zero. But if the boat heels enough to bring the weather float out of the water, this effect no longer operates and the water provides a heavy ballast weight on the float, creating a righting moment. In the abstract sense, the principles at work govern the stability of all boats and ships including those without lateral pontoons. See angle of loll and metacentric height.

The station is owned by Media One Group. On December 31, 1924, the station signed on, making the station the oldest in southwestern New York and third-longest lived in all of Western New York—behind only WGR and WDCZ. As of spring 2018, WJTN broadcasts a 1970s and 1980s-centered classic hits/adult contemporary music format with local news and sports. Programming Local personalities include Dennis Webster, Dan Warren and Lee John. The station airs ABC News every hour and Local News throughout the day with Terry Frank and Noel Blackhall. Syndicated programming heard on WJTN include John Tesh from 5:00pm until 10:00pm weekdays, Jim Bohannon, and Coast to Coast AM. On weekends, the station features Connie Selleca Saturday mornings.

Along with the new simulcast, the station shifted to a gold-based adult contemporary music format (picking up some of the older cuts from the library from WWSE and dropping most of its easy listening instrumentals in most dayparts). The translator signed on in May 2018.WJTN 1240 to air on FM Jim Roselle WJTN's mid-morning man, Jim Roselle, was inducted into the New York State Broadcasters Hall of Fame in June 2010. Roselle spent more than 60 years broadcasting on WJTN in Jamestown. After graduating from Jamestown High School in 1944 Jim Roselle attended St. Lawrence University where he received a bachelor's degree in business administration, while minoring in radio programming and production. It was his experience as a play-by-play broadcaster for S.L.U. football, basketball, and baseball teams that would be a springboard to a life of success. In 1953 Roselle began his radio career at WJTN in Jamestown, New York. Little did Roselle know that what started, as a part-time sportscaster job was truly the beginning of a life of excellence in broadcast and community involvement. This broadcast excellence has bestowed many career highlights upon Roselle, from world travel to London with Jamestown Community College, to the Soviet Union representing the Chautauqua Institution, with the Jamestown High School Acapella Choir to Austria, Germany and Italy, Jamestown High School Band to Macy's Parade and Rose Parade and a week of broadcasting live from Disney World. Roselle is known for his interviews, most of which came from his Bestor Plaza Studio at the world-famous Chautauqua Institution, starting in the summer of 1974. Roselle has interviewed hundreds of powerful speakers including: then-Governor Bill Clinton, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, political humorist Mark Russell, Jane Goodall, Lucille Ball, Tim Russert, fitness guru Richard Simmons, Margaret Meade, Loretta Lorouche, Rocky Marciano. Historians and Pulitzer Prize winners David McCullough, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and James McPherson. Poet-laureates Robert Pinskey, Stanley Kunitze and Billy Collins. Elliott Spitzer and Phil Donahue. Authors - E.L. Doctorow, Joyce Carol Oates, Amy Tan, Roger Rosenblatt. Lee Hamilton-CoChairman of the 9-11 Commission, Hamilton Jordan - President Carter's Chief of Staff, as well as Kings and Queens. His style of interviewing was much different from those of other talk radio personalities. Roselle did detailed research on the people and subjects of his interviews, and his knowledge and insight often surprised and impressed his guests. Roselle featured \\"on air conversation\\" not just stereotype interviews. While most known for his on-air role, it is the common person in the local community that Jim related to most, as signified by his show's opening, \\"Good morning hometown Jamestown and neighbors! Join me in a cup of happiness!\\" The community woke up to his voice every day, but most are unaware of his community affiliations and passions. He has been a member of the Board of Directors for the Lucille Ball Little Theatre for over 30 years; the Jamestown Boys and Girls club for more than 25 years; and most recently at the James Prendergast Library. He also has been the chairman for many community events and enjoyed golfing when he had the chance. Roselle died on March 23, 2016 at the age of 89. WJTN continues to carry regular interviews from Chautauqua Institution after Roselle's death.

Owned by Media One Group, the station serves as a local affiliate for the Cleveland Indians Radio Network. History AM 1340 signed on in 1948 as WJOC. It used the call sign WXYJ in the mid-1960s before adopting the WKSN call sign and \\"Kissin'\\" slogan by no later than 1968. For most of its early history, WKSN played a Top 40 format using the \\"Good Guys\\" slogan.http://www.las- solanas.com/arsa/station.php?⁢=2&s1;=-1&q;=Jamestown&ix;=0&rs;=1954 A television sister station, WNYP (channel 26), signed on in 1966, when both stations were owned by Bud Paxson; channel 26 shut down after three years and its license is now being used by a religious station. During the 1990s and early 2000s, WKSN (Kissin' Oldies) was an oldies outlet carrying a local morning show and a midday show by Paul Hoefler (now performing commercial jingles in the area), as well the satellite Good Time Oldies from Jones Radio Networks until the station was bought out by Media One Group, LLC in 2003. Soon after Media One's purchase, WKSN began being used as a counterprogramming station to the other AM radio station in Jamestown, WJTN, also owned by Media One Group. From approximately 2004 until the summer of 2008, the station ran with shows such as Rush Limbaugh (counterprogrammed to a liberal program known as The Hall Closet on WJTN), Imus in the Morning, Bill Bennett, Dr. Dean Edell and Glenn Beck, as well as affiliations with Talk Radio Network and FOX Sports Radio. On July 4, 2008, WKSN switched back to the oldies format. With the change to oldies (and The Hall Closet's discontinuation), Edell, Beck and Ed Schultz were moved to sister station WJTN (Schultz actually began airing on WJTN on June 23, 2008 in Ray Hall's time slot, so both WJTN and WKSN were airing Schultz from June 23 to July 3, 2008), while Rush Limbaugh was dropped from the market altogether (after a brief stint on rival station WLKW-FM, the show has again been absent from the southwestern New York airwaves). Not long afterward, WJTN also changed to a music format, extending its adult standards/MOR format (at the time only played on Jim Roselle's show) throughout the day. WKSN was an affiliate of Scott Shannon's The True Oldies Channel until that station ceased terrestrial distribution in June 2014. WKSN was an affiliate of NFL on Westwood One then moved to sister station WJTN; for many years, it was the radio home of the Jamestown Jammers (Jammers broadcasts were dropped from WKSN several years before the team left Jamestown). WKSN began streaming its programming on the Internet in November 2019.https://wksn.com/listen-live References External links  Jamestown, New York KSN Oldies radio stations in the United States ","title":"WKSN"},{"id":"12873560","text":"Eugenia koolauensis, commonly known as Koolau eugenia or nioi, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is endemic to Hawaii, where it could previously be found on the islands of Molokai and Oahu; today populations only exist on the latter. This is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. This is one of two Eugenia species native to Hawaii, and the only endemic.USFWS. E. koolauensis Five-year Review. January 2008. It is a shrub or tree grows 2 to 7 meters tall. The tips of the branches and the undersides of the leaves are hairy. White flowers occur in the leaf axils Habitat It inhabits dry gulches and ridges in coastal mesic and mixed mesic forests on the Koolau and Waianae Ranges. Associated plant species include maile (Alyxia oliviformis), ahakea lau nui (Bobea elatior), Carex meyenii, uluhe (Dicranopteris linearis), kōlea lau nui (Myrsine lessertiana), olopua (Nestegis sandwicensis), hala pepe (Pleomele halapepe), ālaa (Pouteria sandwicensis), alahee (Psydrax odorata), hao (Rauvolfia sandwicensis), and pūkiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae). It is threatened by habitat loss and recently Puccinia psidii, a non-native fungal disease. In 2008 there were fewer than 300 mature plants in the Koolau Range and only three in the Waianae Range. It is extirpated from the island of Molokai, where its former habitat was cleared for pineapple fields.

The task of the committee was to \\"review the laws concerning obscenity, indecency and violence in publications, displays and entertainments in England and Wales, except in the field of broadcasting, and to review the arrangements for film censorship in England and Wales\\". The committee reported in 1979 that: \\"Given the amount of explicit sexual material in circulation and the allegations often made about its effects, it is striking that one can find case after case of sex crimes and murder without any hint at all that pornography was present in the background.\\" The Committee's report was evidently influenced by the liberal thinking of John Stuart Mill, a philosopher greatly admired by Williams, and who used Mill's principle of liberty to develop what he called the \\"harm condition,\\" whereby \\"no conduct should be suppressed by law unless it can be shown to harm someone.\\"Jeffries, Stuart, The Quest for Truth The Guardian, November 30, 2002. Williams concluded that pornography could not be shown to be harmful and that \\"the role of pornography in influencing society is not very important ... to think anything else is to get the problem of pornography out of proportion with the many other problems that face our society today.\\" The committee reported that, so long as children were protected from seeing it, adults should be free to read and watch pornography as they saw fit.Obituary, no byline. \\"Professor Sir Bernard Williams,\\" The Times, June 14, 2003. It found that the existing variety of laws in the field should be scrapped, and that terms such as ‘obscene’, ‘indecent’ and ‘deprave' and corrupt’ should be abandoned as they were no longer useful.Media and Arts Law Review: Obscenity, Pornography and Art The Committee thought existing laws should be replaced with a comprehensive new statute, under which the availability of material would be restricted so that it did not cause offence to reasonable people, and was not accessible to children. The recommended restrictions on availability would not have been confined just to material that involved nudity and/or which was sexually explicit. Restrictions were to apply to: \\"matter (other than the printed word) and to a performance whose unrestricted availability is offensive to reasonable people by reason of the manner in which it portrays, deals with or relates to violence, cruelty or horror, or sexual, faecal or urinary functions or genital organs.\\" Regarding the definition of pornography the commission stated that, \\"a pornographic representation is one that combines two features: it has a certain function or intention, to arouse its audience sexually, and also a certain content, explicit representations of sexual material (organs, postures, activity, etc). On the difference between 'obscenity' and 'pornography', the committee found that the word 'obscene' was a subjective term that refers to peoples reaction to material, and that \\" it principally expresses an intense or extreme version of what we have called ‘offensiveness’. It may be that it particularly emphasises the most strongly aversive element in that notion, the idea of an object's being repulsive or disgusting.\\" 'Pornography' however was found to be \\"a rather more objective expression referring to a certain kind of writing, picture etc ... Pornography will have some tendency to be obscene, but will not necessarily be so ... a tendency to be offensive is built into it, but it is not universally even offensive ... Still less must it inevitably be very strongly offensive or obscene.\\" On whether art could be obscene, it reported that, \\"work ... may be experienced as offensive, and also be experienced as having aesthetic interest, but in the case of which the two experiences do not occur at the same time. These will be works which are found offensive at first, or by a spectator who remains distanced from them, but which lose that character for someone involved in them. It did however recognize that \\"it would be unwise to deny that ... there could be works which were, and remained, offensive, indeed intensely offensive or obscene.\\" See also * British Board of Film Classification * Effects of pornography * Meese Report, 1986 U.S. Attorney General's Commission on Pornography * President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, 1969, United States References  External links  * H2G2: Censorship, Obscenity and the Williams Committee * terramedia.co.uk: British film and video censorship and classification: Origins and the first 60 years Film censorship in the United Kingdom United Kingdom pornography law Obscenity law Home Office (United Kingdom) 1970s in the United Kingdom 1970s in British cinema ","title":"Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship"},{"id":"12873564","text":"Syzygium koordersianum is a species of plant in the family Myrtaceae.

Background In 1995, a Baltimore-based independent label booked Boy Hits Car on their first national tour—six weeks straight performing nearly every night. During this time the band decided that no matter what the cost, they would try to make a lifestyle out of performing their music---music they eventually dubbed 'Lovecore'. BHC continued to write, record and tour until 1997 when they landed a deal with a Texas-based independent label. They recorded their first full-length CD---'My Animal' which was released and distributed in 1998 through NMG music. After only a few weeks, they lost their distribution deal but the band pressed on.http://www.boyhitscar.com/bio.html The song \\"Mr. Loh\\" is about real-life Malibu man Eugene Loh, who would often do calisthenics on the beach while naked.

Like the concepts of meagre and measure zero sets, a porous set can be considered \\"sparse\\" or \\"lacking bulk\\"; however, porous sets are not equivalent to either meagre sets or measure zero sets, as shown below. Definition Let (X, d) be a complete metric space and let E be a subset of X. Let B(x, r) denote the closed ball in (X, d) with centre x ∈ X and radius r > 0. E is said to be porous if there exist constants 0 < α < 1 and r0 > 0 such that, for every 0 < r ≤ r0 and every x ∈ X, there is some point y ∈ X with :B(y, alpha r) subseteq B(x, r) setminus E. A subset of X is called σ-porous if it is a countable union of porous subsets of X. Properties * Any porous set is nowhere dense. Hence, all σ-porous sets are meagre sets (or of the first category). * If X is a finite-dimensional Euclidean space Rn, then porous subsets are sets of Lebesgue measure zero. * However, there does exist a non- σ-porous subset P of Rn which is of the first category and of Lebesgue measure zero. This is known as Zajíček's theorem. * The relationship between porosity and being nowhere dense can be illustrated as follows: if E is nowhere dense, then for x ∈ X and r > 0, there is a point y ∈ X and s > 0 such that ::B(y, s) subseteq B(x, r) setminus E. : However, if E is also porous, then it is possible to take s = αr (at least for small enough r), where 0 < α < 1 is a constant that depends only on E.

It is the only species of Cotoneaster native to the British Isles. It has never been found naturally at any other location. In the past, it was included within the widespread eastern European Cotoneaster integerrimus, but differs from that in genetic profile. It is a deciduous shrub growing to tall and broad. The leaves are oval-acute, long, green and thinly pubescent above, densely pubescent below and on the leaf margin, with white hairs. The flowers are produced in corymbs of one to four (occasionally up to seven) together in early to mid spring (earlier than on C. integerrimus), each flower diameter, with five white to pale pink petals. The fruit is a red pome diameter, containing two or three seeds. The seed has a very low germination rate. Status Cotoneaster cambricus is critically endangered, with only six plants known in the wild, which are not regenerating naturally. This number has been supplemented in recent years by an additional 11 cultivated plants, grown from cuttings and seeds. Reintroduction has so far only had limited success; the 11 additional are the only survivors of 33 plants grown and planted out. The Biodiversity Action Plan for the species calls for this to be increased to 100 plants by 2030. Specimens are also cultivated in a number of botanical gardens. Historically, the species was much more abundant on the Great Orme when it was discovered in 1783. The population was reduced in the 19th century by collectors deliberately digging up plants for their gardens. More recently overgrazing pressure by sheep, feral goats, and rabbits has reduced size of existing plants, reduced flowering and prevented those new seedlings that have developed from establishing themselves. They have also been facing competition from invasion seedlings of other species of Cotoneaster arising from cultivated plants in gardens in nearby towns. It has full legal protection under Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

He was one of the three foundation sires of the modern Thoroughbred racehorse, along with Matchem and Eclipse. Herod was the foundation sire responsible for keeping the Byerley Turk sire-line alive.Craig, Dennis, Breeding Racehorses from Cluster Mares, J A Allen, London, 1964 Background Bred by Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, he was by the stallion Tartar, a very good racehorse, who won many races including the King's plate at Litchfield, the King's plate at Guildford, and the King's plate at Newmarket. In addition to Herod, Tartar sired Thais (dam of Silvertail), Fanny (second dam of King Fergus), the O'Kelly Old Tartar mare (dam of Volunteer), and others. Herod's dam, Cypron (1750 bay filly), was bred by Sir W. St Quintin. Herod was a half-brother Lady Bolingbroke (dam of Tetotum, Epsom Oaks) and a mare (1757) (dam of Clay Hall Marske) by Regulus.ASB - Cypron Retrieved on 2009-8-14 Description Herod was a fine, bay horse standing 15.3 hands high with a small star and no white on his legs.Montgomery, E.S, “The Thoroughbred”, Arco, New York, 1973 He was a powerful horse that was especially good at four-mile distances.Ahnert, Rainer L. (editor in chief), “Thoroughbred Breeding of the World”, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 Racing career Herod began racing at five, the usual age to begin training for this period, in October 1763 winning a race on the four mile Beacon course at Newmarket. At age six, he won another race at Newmarket, followed by a four-miler at Ascot and a match against Antinous over the Beacon course. When he was seven, his owner died and he was sold in a dispersal sale to Sir John Moore, and it wasn't until 1766 that he returned to the track, where he won again against Antinous in a match over the same course. His career began to close at this point, as he lost to Ascham, then to Turf, and then finished last in a race at York, after a bleeding attack. He started twice the following year, before retiring to stud. Breeding career Herod retired in 1770 and stood at the stud of Sir John Moore at Neather Hall, for a fee of 10 guineas, later raised to 25 guineas. He was the leading sire in Great Britain eight times, (1777 to 1784), before his son, Highflyer (1785 to 1796, 1798) and grandson Sir Peter Teazle (1799 to 1802, and 1804 to 1809) took over. Herod's male line continues today in the pedigree of the 2007 Eclipse Stakes winner, Notnowcato. His most important offspring include: * Florizel: 1768 bay colt, won 16 races out of 23 starts. Sired Diomed, winner of the first Derby and incredibly influential sire in America. * Fortitude: sire of John Bull * Highflyer: 1774 bay colt, the most important son of Herod. Unbeaten in 14 races, leading sire several times, one of the 4 foundation lines of the classic Thoroughbred. Got Sir Peter Teazle, Rockingham, Delpini, Escape, St. George, and broodmare Prunella. * Justice: sired Rhadamanathus, Daedalus, and Trifle * Phoenomenon: won the St. Leger, leading sire * Woodpecker: 1773 chestnut colt, won the Craven Stakes in 1778, 1779 and 1781, and a 1,400 guineas handicap sweep in 1780 and 140 guineas purse at Newmarket in 1781, both times beating Potoooooooo (pronounced \\"Pot eight oes\\"). Although Woodpecker was initially overshadowed by the success of Highflyer, it is Woodpecker who is responsible for the continuation of the Herod sire line to the present day. Woodpecker sired Buzzard, sire of Selim who in turn sired Sultan, six time leading sire, who in turn sired Bay Middleton, another leading sire in the mid 1800s. Herod sired the winners of 497 races worth £201,505. He was still covering mares until his death, at age 22, at Netherhall (written as Neather Hall in the old calendars) on 12 May 1780.Morris, Simon; Tesio Power 2000 - Stallions of the World Pedigree

Geologic history Geologically, the Cobequid Mountains are considered part of the Appalachians. The range stretches from Cape Chignecto in Cumberland County in the west through to Pictou County in the east. The Cobequid Mountains trace their geologic history to the Precambrian and Devonian ages; consequently the mountains are composed of a combination of sediments, granites, and volcanic rock all of which has been crushed and folded by continental drift when this part of Nova Scotia was located at the centre of the Pangea supercontinent. Subsequent erosion over millions of years has resulted in the present-day low range of mountains and rolling hills. The part of northern Nova Scotia which contains the Cobequid Mountains is believed to have been linked with what is now northern Europe. Its collision with a section from present-day northern Africa has resulted in the current landscape in the province; a remnant fault line from this event, the Cobequid-Chedabucto Fault, extends along the southern portion of the Cobequid Mountains, immediately north of the Minas Basin and Cobequid Bay east to Canso. Some mistakenly consider the Cobequid Mountains to extend into Antigonish County further east, however this smaller range is geologically distinct and is named the Pictou-Antigonish Highlands. Highest elevations The highest point of the Cobequid Mountains is an unnamed peak on the eastern side of the Wentworth Valley (). Other high peaks include Higgins Mountain (), Nuttby Mountain (), Dalhousie Mountain (), and Mt. Thom (). Freshwater resources The range contains an abundance of freshwater lakes and some springs which form headwaters that flow via a number of small rivers and streams south into the Minas Basin and north into Northumberland Strait. Several escarpments associated with the Fundy Basin have been formed from fault lines, resulting in a number of waterfalls on the southern mountain slopes. Forests and mineral resources Forests covering the Cobequid Mountains are mainly of hardwood species sugar maple (also known locally as 'rock maple') and yellow birch on mountain slopes, which present spectacular displays in autumn with the changing of the colours. Steep stream and river valleys are dominated by red spruce stands. The lower slopes consist of balsam fir, red spruce, black spruce, white spruce, paper birch, red maple and silver maple (also known locally as 'white maple'). The sedimentary deposits in the Cobequid Mountains hold several coal deposits in various basins, stretching across the northern slope of the mountains in Cumberland County (from Joggins through River Hebert to Springhill) and on the southern edge at Debert. Igneous rocks yielded iron ore at Londonderry.Ronnie Van Dommelen, Londonderry iron mining district, The Mineralogy of Nova Scotia References External links *Waterfalls of the Cobequid Mountains *Feature in the Natural History of Nova Scotia Mountains of Nova Scotia Mountain ranges of Nova Scotia Landforms of Colchester County Landforms of Cumberland County, Nova Scotia Landforms of Pictou County ","title":"Cobequid Mountains"},{"id":"12873749","text":"Eugenia plumbea is a species of plant in the family Myrtaceae.

She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction Bullock was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 2110, on 26 September 1944, at Richmond, California, by Kaiser Cargo, Inc.; launched on 2 December 1944; sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Barker; acquired by the Navy on 2 March 1945; and commissioned that same day, Lieutenant Henry N. Barkhausen in command. Service history =World War II Pacific Theatre operations= After a brief fitting out period at Oakland, California, the new cargo ship, with its inexperienced crew, got underway on 19 March 1945 for a shakedown cruise. Trial runs, tests of operating gear, and a full scale battle problem pointed out deficiencies in both ship and crew that received intensive work during the succeeding weeks. Bullock returned to San Francisco, California, on 12 April and loaded hull and engine spares, radio and radar gear, and frozen and chilled provisions to carry to the Admiralty Islands and the Philippine Islands. Bullock departed San Francisco on 20 April and headed for Manus where she arrived 23 days later. =Operating in \\"rear areas\\"= Between 13 May and 14 December, Bullock ferried military passengers and cargo between Manus, the Philippines, the Netherlands East Indies, and New Guinea. Having entered the war late and consigned to rear areas, the cargo ship never faced an enemy air or surface attack, although, while underway, she still steered zigzag courses and held battle drills because the threat of submarine attack, remote though it was, still existed. Bullocks mission did not change with the cessation of hostilities in August. She continued to transport supplies until 14 December, when she weighed anchor at Manila Bay and headed for the United States. =Post-war decommissioning= Bullock transited the Panama Canal on 28 January 1946 and reported to the Atlantic Fleet for duty. She arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 February, but received orders to Baltimore, Maryland, to be decommissioned. Bullock was decommissioned and returned to the Maritime Commission on 13 March 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 28 March 1946. She was purchased by Dichmann, Wright, and Pugh in January 1947 for the Turkish government, for whom she began operation in 1947 under the name Edirne. Turkish service Bullock went through several name changes in 1947 and 1948. She was renamed Edirne in 1947, then Adana in 1948, and then again in 1948 she was renamed Malatya. Along with her sister ships, ex-, renamed Kars, ex-, renamed Kastamonu, and ex-, renamed Rize, she would, for the next 15 years, provide cargo service between Turkey and Northern Europe. She was finally broken up in the Turkish port of Aliağa in December 1982. Military awards and honors The record does not indicate any battle stars for Bullock.

Bruton received permission from the band to stage Broken Bride in spring 2006 and proposed a black box theater production for that fall. Broken Bride utilized a minimalistic, expressionist approach to stage design wherein a variety of complex locations can be implied within a limited setting. Music for the production was provided by the band in the form of a re-mixed version of the album, completely stripped of all primary and back-up vocals, with the exception of a few harmonies in \\"Save Our City\\" and \\"Part III: The Lamb and the Dragon\\". The melodies were arranged for the fifteen member cast by Tristan Cosino, who also coached and directed the ensemble. = NYMF/Chinese Mother Jewish Daughter Production = In 2013, Ludo's Broken Bride: A Rock Opera, a different stage adaptation created by Chinese Mother Jewish Daughter, premiered at ANT Fest 2013 in New York City. In 2014, an expanded concert version of the production consisting of 24 numbers, was presented at The Cutting Room. This modified version was presented at NYMF and ran for one week in August 2016. The expanded story told of Tommy (the Traveler), played by Carson Higgins, who attempts to return home to his lover, Oriel (Gabrielle McClinton), while a flashback of himself (Michael Jayne Walker) falls in love with Oriel throughout the show. Other cast members included Brian Charles Rooney as King Simius, Marissa O'Donnell as Mena/Mayor, and Larry Hamilton as The Archangel Raguel.

It often refers, specifically, to a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite, also called \\"liquid bleach\\". Many bleaches have broad spectrum bactericidal properties, making them useful for disinfecting and sterilizing and are used in swimming pool sanitation to control bacteria, viruses, and algae and in many places where sterile conditions are required. They are also used in many industrial processes, notably in the bleaching of wood pulp. Bleaches also have other minor uses like removing mildew, killing weeds, and increasing the longevity of cut flowers. Bleaches work by reacting with many colored organic compounds, such as natural pigments, and turning them into colorless ones. While most bleaches are oxidizing agents (chemicals that can remove electrons from other molecules), some are reducing agents (that donate electrons). Chlorine, a powerful oxidizer, is the active agent in many household bleaches. Since pure chlorine is a toxic corrosive gas, these products usually contain hypochlorite, which releases chlorine when needed. \\"Bleaching powder\\" usually means a formulation containing calcium hypochlorite. Oxidizing bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine are usually based on peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate, and sodium perborate. These bleaches are called 'non-chlorine bleach,' 'oxygen bleach' or 'color-safe bleach.' Reducing bleaches have niche uses, such as sulfur dioxide used to bleach wool, either as gas or from solutions of sodium dithionite; and sodium borohydride. Bleaches generally react with many other organic substances besides the intended colored pigments, so they can weaken or damage natural materials like fibers, cloth, and leather, and intentionally applied dyes such as the indigo of denim. For the same reason, ingestion of the products, breathing of the fumes, or contact with skin or eyes can cause health damage.  History  The earliest form of bleaching involved spreading fabrics and cloth out in a bleachfield to be whitened by the action of the sun and water. In the 17th century, there was a significant cloth bleaching industry in Western Europe, using alternating alkaline baths (generally lye) and acid baths (such as lactic acid from sour milk, and later diluted sulfuric acid). The whole process lasted up to six months. Chlorine-based bleaches, which shortened that process from months to hours, were invented in Europe in the late 18th century. Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered chlorine in 1774, and in 1785 French scientist Claude Berthollet recognized that it could be used to bleach fabrics. Berthollet also discovered sodium hypochlorite, which became the first commercial bleach, named Eau de Javel (\\"Javel water\\") after the borough in Paris where it was produced. Scottish chemist and industrialist Charles Tennant proposed in 1798 a solution of calcium hypochlorite as an alternative for Javel water, and patented bleaching powder (solid calcium hypochlorite) in 1799. Around 1820, French chemist Antoine Germain Labarraque discovered the disinfecting and deodorizing ability of hypochlorites, and was instrumental in popularizing their use for such purpose.Scott, James, transl. (1828). On the disinfecting properties of Labarraque's preparations of chlorine Published by S. Highley. His work greatly improved medical practice, public health, and the sanitary conditions in hospitals, slaughterhouses, and all industries dealing with animal products.Labarraque, Antoine-Germain, Nouvelle biographie générale, volume 28 (1859), columns 323-324. Louis Jacques Thénard first produced hydrogen peroxide in 1818 by reacting barium peroxide with nitric acid. Hydrogen peroxide was first used for bleaching in 1882, but did not become commercially important until after 1930. Sodium perborate as a laundry bleach had been used in Europe since the early twentieth century, but did not become popular in North America until the 1980s.  Mechanism of action  = Whitening = Colors of natural organic materials typically arise from organic pigments, such as beta carotene. Chemical bleaches work in one of two ways: *An oxidizing bleach works by breaking the chemical bonds that make up the chromophore. This changes the molecule into a different substance that either does not contain a chromophore, or contains a chromophore that does not absorb visible light. This is the mechanism of bleaches based on chlorine but also of oxygen-anions which react through initial nucleophilic attack. *A reducing bleach works by converting double bonds in the chromophore into single bonds. This eliminates the ability of the chromophore to absorb visible light. This is the mechanism of bleaches based on sulfur dioxide. Sunlight acts as a bleach through a process leading to similar results: high energy photons of light, often in the violet or ultraviolet range, can disrupt the bonds in the chromophore, rendering the resulting substance colorless. Extended exposure often leads to massive discoloration usually reducing the colors to white and typically very faded blue. = Antimicrobial efficacy = The broad-spectrum effectiveness of most bleaches is due to their general chemical reactivity against organic compounds, rather than the selective inhibitory or toxic actions of antibiotics. They irreversibly denature or destroy many proteins, making them extremely versatile disinfectants. Hypochlorite bleaches in low concentration were also found to attack bacteria by interfering with heat shock proteins on their walls. Classes of bleaches Most industrial and household bleaches belong to three broad classes: * Chlorine-based bleaches, whose active agent is chlorine, usually from the decomposition of some chlorine compound like hypochlorite or chloramine. * Peroxide-based bleaches, whose active agent is oxygen, almost always from the decomposition of a peroxide compound like hydrogen peroxide. * Sulfur dioxide based bleaches, whose active agent is sulfur dioxide, possibly from the decomposition of some oxosulfur anion. =Chlorine-based bleaches= Chlorine-based bleaches are found in many household \\"bleach\\" products, as well as in specialized products for hospitals, public health, water chlorination, and industrial processes. The grade of chlorine-based bleaches is often expressed as percent active chlorine. One gram of a 100% active chlorine bleach has the same bleaching power as one gram of elemental chlorine. The most common chlorine-based bleaches are: * Sodium hypochlorite (), usually as a 3–6% solution in water, usually called \\"liquid bleach\\" or just \\"bleach\\". Historically called \\"Javel water\\". It is used in many households to whiten laundry, disinfect hard surfaces in kitchens and bathrooms, treat water for drinking and keep swimming pools free of infectious agents. * Bleaching powder (formerly known as \\"chlorinated lime\\"), usually a mixture of calcium hypochlorite (), calcium hydroxide (lime, ), and calcium chloride () in variable amounts. Sold as a white powder or in tablets, is used in many of the same applications as sodium hypochlorite, but is more stable and contains more available chlorine. * Chlorine gas (). It is used as a disinfectant in water treatment, especially to make drinking water and in large public swimming pools. It was used extensively to bleach wood pulp, but this use has decreased significantly due to environmental concerns. * Chlorine dioxide (). This unstable gas is generated in situ or stored as dilute aqueous solutions. It finds large-scale applications for the bleaching of wood pulp, fats and oils, cellulose, flour, textiles, beeswax, skin, and in a number of other industries. Other examples of chlorine-based bleaches, used mostly as disinfectants, are monochloramine, halazone, and sodium dichloroisocyanurate. =Peroxide-based bleaches= Peroxide-based bleaches are characterized by the peroxide chemical group, namely two oxygen atoms connected by a single bond, (–O–O–). This bond is easily broken, giving rise to very reactive oxygen species, which are the active agents of the bleach. The main products in this class are: * Hydrogen peroxide itself (). It is used, for example, to bleach wood pulp and hair or to prepare other bleaching agents like the perborates, percarbonates, peracids, etc. * Sodium percarbonate (), an adduct of hydrogen peroxide and sodium carbonate (\\"soda ash\\" or \\"washing soda\\", ). Dissolved in water, it yields a solution of the two products, that combines the degreasing action of the carbonate with the bleaching action of the peroxide. * Sodium perborate (). Dissolved in water it forms some hydrogen peroxide, but also the perborate anion () which can perform nucleophilic oxidation. * Peracetic (peroxoacetic) acid (). Generated in situ by some laundry detergents, and also marketed for use as industrial and agricultural disinfection and water treatment.V. Namboodiri and A. Garg (2017): \\"Evaluation of Combined Peracetic acid and UV treatment for Disinfection of Secondary Wastewater Effluent\\". document EPA/600/R-17/172, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, * benzoyl peroxide (). It is used in topical medications for acne and to bleach flour.(2004) \\"Benzoyl peroxide\\" FAO Publication FNP 52 Addendum 12. * Ozone (). While not properly a peroxide, its mechanism of action is similar. It is used in the manufacture of paper products, especially newsprint and white Kraft paper. *Potassium persulfate (K2 S2O8) and other persulfate salts. It, alongside ammonium and sodium persulfate, are common in hair lightening products. *Permanganate salts such as Potassium permanganate (KMnO4). In the food industry, other oxidizing products like bromates are used as flour bleaching and maturing agents. =Reducing bleaches= Sodium dithionite (also known as sodium hydrosulfite) is one of the most important reductive bleaching agents. It is a white crystalline powder with a weak sulfurous odor. It can be obtained by reacting sodium bisulfite with zinc :2 NaHSO3 + Zn → Na2S2O4 + Zn(OH)2 It is used as such in some industrial dyeing processes to eliminate excess dye, residual oxide, and unintended pigments and for bleaching wood pulp. Reaction of sodium dithionite with formaldehyde produces Rongalite, :Na2S2O4 + 2 CH2O + H2O → NaHOCH2SO3 + NaHOCH2SO2 which is used in bleaching wood pulp, cotton, wool, leather and clay. =Photographic bleach= In Reversal processing, residual silver in the emulsion after the first development is reduced to a soluble silver salt using a chemical bleach, most commonly EDTA. A conventional fixer then dissolves the reduced silver but leaving the unexposed silver halide intact. This unexposed halide is then exposed to light or is chemically treated so that a second development produces a positive image. In colour and chromogenic film, this also generates a dye image in proportion to the silver. Photographic bleaches are also used in black-and-white photography to selectively reduce silver to reduce silver density in negatives or prints. In such cases the bleach composition is typically an acid solution of potassium dichromate.  Environmental impact  A Risk Assessment Report (RAR) conducted by the European Union on sodium hypochlorite conducted under Regulation EEC 793/93 concluded that this substance is safe for the environment in all its current, normal uses.European Union Risk Assessment Report. 2007. Sodium Hypochlorite (CAS No: 7681-52-9; EINECS No: 231-668-3): Final report, November 2007 (Final Approved Version); see Risk Assessment Report on Sodium Hypochlorite, Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks, 12 March 2008. This is due to its high reactivity and instability. The disappearance of hypochlorite is practically immediate in the natural aquatic environment, reaching in a short time concentration as low as 10−22 μg/L or less in all emission scenarios. In addition, it was found that while volatile chlorine species may be relevant in some indoor scenarios, they have a negligible impact in open environmental conditions. Further, the role of hypochlorite pollution is assumed as negligible in soils. Industrial bleaching agents can also be sources of concern. For example, the use of elemental chlorine in the bleaching of wood pulp produces organochlorines and persistent organic pollutants, including dioxins. According to an industry group, the use of chlorine dioxide in these processes has reduced the dioxin generation to under detectable levels. However, respiratory risk from chlorine and highly toxic chlorinated byproducts still exists. A recent European study indicated that sodium hypochlorite and organic chemicals (e.g., surfactants, fragrances) contained in several household cleaning products can react to generate chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These chlorinated compounds are emitted during cleaning applications, some of which are toxic and probable human carcinogens. The study showed that indoor air concentrations significantly increase (8–52 times for chloroform and 1–1170 times for carbon tetrachloride, respectively, above baseline quantities in the household) during the use of bleach-containing products. The increase in chlorinated volatile organic compound concentrations was the lowest for plain bleach and the highest for the products in the form of \\"thick liquid and gel.\\" The significant increases observed in indoor air concentrations of several chlorinated VOCs (especially carbon tetrachloride and chloroform) indicate that the bleach use may be a source that could be important in terms of inhalation exposure to these compounds. While the authors suggested that using these cleaning products may significantly increase the cancer risk,Odabasi, M., Halogenated Volatile Organic Compounds from the Use of Chlorine-Bleach- Containing Household Products, Slide presentation (2008) this conclusion appears to be hypothetical: :* The highest level cited for a concentration of carbon tetrachloride (seemingly of highest concern) is 459 micrograms per cubic meter, translating to 0.073 ppm (part per million), or 73 ppb (part per billion). The OSHA-allowable time-weighted average concentration over an eight-hour period is 10 ppm, almost 140 times higher; :* The OSHA highest allowable peak concentration (5-minute exposure for five minutes in a 4-hour period) is 200 ppm, twice as high as the reported highest peak level (from the headspace of a bottle of a sample of bleach plus detergent).  Disinfection  Sodium hypochlorite solution, 3–6%, (common household bleach) is typically diluted for safe use when disinfecting surfaces and when used to treat drinking water. A weak solution of 2% household bleach in warm water is typical for sanitizing smooth surfaces prior to the brewing of beer or wine. US Government regulations (21 CFR Part 178) allow food processing equipment and food contact surfaces to be sanitized with solutions containing bleach, provided that the solution is allowed to drain adequately before contact with food, and that the solutions do not exceed 200 parts per million (ppm) available chlorine (for example, one tablespoon of typical household bleach containing 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, per gallon of water). A 1-in-47 dilution of household bleach with water (1 part bleach to 47 parts water) is effective against many bacteria and some viruses in homes. Even \\"scientific-grade\\", commercially produced disinfection solutions such as Virocidin-X usually have sodium hypochlorite as their sole active ingredient, though they also contain surfactants (to prevent beading) and fragrances (to conceal the bleach smell). See Hypochlorous acid for a discussion of the mechanism for disinfectant action. An oral rinse with a 0.05% dilute solution of household bleach is shown to treat gingivitis. Diluted sodium hypochlorite at a rate of 2000–1 (0.05% concentration) may represent an efficacious, safe and affordable antimicrobial agent in the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. Color safe bleach Color safe bleach is a chemical that uses hydrogen peroxide as the active ingredient (to help remove stains) rather than sodium hypochlorite or chlorine. It also has chemicals in it that help brighten colors. Hydrogen peroxide is also used for sterilization purposes and water treatment, but its disinfectant capabilities may be limited due to the concentration in the colorsafe bleach solution as compared to other applications. Health hazards The safety of bleaches depends on the compounds present, and their concentration. Generally speaking, the ingestion of bleaches will cause damage to the esophagus and stomach, possibly leading to death. On contact with the skin or eyes, it causes irritation, drying, and potentially burns. Inhalation of bleach fumes can damage the lungs. Personal protective equipment should always be used when using bleach. Bleach should never be mixed with vinegar or other acids as this will create highly toxic chlorine gas and can cause severe burns internally and externally. Mixing bleach with ammonia similarly produces toxic chloramine gas, which can burn the lungs. Mixing bleach with hydrogen peroxide results in an exothermic chemical reaction that releases oxygen, and may cause the contents to splatter and cause skin and eye injury. Heating bleach and boiling it may produce chlorates, a strong oxidizer which may lead to a fire or explosion. =False claims as a cure= Miracle Mineral Supplement (MMS), also promoted as \\"Master Mineral Solution\\" or \\"Chlorine Dioxide Solution\\" or CDS, to evade restrictions by online retail platforms, is a bleach solution that has been fraudulently promoted as a cure-all since 2006. Its main active ingredient is sodium chlorite, which is \\"activated\\" with citric acid to form chlorine dioxide. In an attempt to evade health regulations, its inventor, former Scientologist, Jim Humble, formed the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, a fake religion whose \\"sacrament\\" is MMS. During the COVID-19 pandemic advocates of MMS, such as QAnon proponent Jordan Sather and Mark Grenon, who are affiliated with the Genesis II Church, began to suggest this would treat COVID-19. Several sources interpreted remarks by U.S. President Trump, in an April 23, 2020 briefing, as promoting this claim, leading the CDC, scientists, and bleach companies to re-state that bleach is harmful to humans and should not be ingested or injected. MSN News quoted Professor Rob Chilcott, a toxicology expert from the University of Hertfordshire, that there is no scientific evidence that bleach or disinfectants will affect viral particles, but that injecting bleach would \\"likely result in significant, irreversible harm and probably a very unpleasant death.\\"  See also  * Calcium hypochlorite * Hydrogen peroxide * Tooth whitening * Washing soda  References   Further reading  * Bodkins, Dr. Bailey.

It is situated in Kampar Regency in Riau province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Its surviving temples and other archaeological remains are thought to date to the eleventh and twelfth century AD. It is one of the largest and best-preserved ancient temple complexes in Sumatra. History The ruin of Muara Takus stupa in 1933 Candi Muara Takus was constructed by the maritime- based Sriwijaya Empire in the eleventh century. The architecture and design of the temples clearly indicates that they are of Mahayana Buddhist origin. It has been suggested by Schnitger that the major temples at Muara Takus may have undergone major renovations in the twelfth century. It is thought that the area was used as both a religious and trade centre by Srivijaya. The site was abandoned for many centuries before it was rediscovered by Cornet De Groot in 1860. The site was explored and surveyed by W.P Groenveld in 1880 and excavations have been conducted periodically since. The research on the Muara Takus archaeological site was carried out in 1983 and it resulted in mapping of the ancient embankment remnants, the Mahligai Temple compound, and other ancient structures. The site is now protected as a national monument. Design and decoration The temple complex of Candi Muara Takus is surrounded by a 1 metre tall stone perimeter wall that measures 74 x 74 metres. The outer wall is penetrated by a gateway on the northern side. Within the walls are the remains of four substantial Buddhist temples (candi). The most unusual of these is Candi Mahligai. This lotus-shaped Buddhist stupa is unique in Indonesia though there are numerous similar ancient structures in Thailand and Myanmar. This structure is founded on an octagonal base and reaches a height of 14.30 metres. The uppermost level of the stupa is decorated with lion figures that are barely discernible from below. On the east side of Candi Mahligai is the base of Candi Palangka. It is constructed from red stone and now only reaches a height of 1.45 metres. It was reportedly much taller at the time of the earliest colonial expeditions to the site but the upper terraces have long since collapsed. A third structure within the complex is Candi Bungsu. The most striking thing about this temple is that it was built from two very different kinds of stone. One part is built from red stone and the other section from sandstone. This temple now reaches a height of 6.20 metres. The largest structure at Candi Muara Takus is Candi Tua. Its base measures 32.80 metres x 21.80 metres and it reaches a height of 8.50 metres. This temple is terraced and it bears some resemblance in its design to the much larger stupa, Candi Borobudur, in Java. Like all the temples at Candi Muara Takus, Candi Tua features only minimal decoration. The most notable decorative feature are the seated lion figures on the upper terraces.

In 1989, KWYD-FM was sold to Optima Communications which flipped the station to a new-age music/smooth jazz format as KBZE, using the on-air moniker \\"The Breeze.\\" (On October 31, 2008 the KWYD- FM call letters were picked up by a radio station in Boise, Idaho, which broadcasts a rhythmic contemporary format.) Two years later, the call letters and format were changed again. The station became a country outlet with the call sign KHII, using the on-air handle \\"K-High.\\" Optima Communications entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Pikes Peak Broadcasting Company to operate the station in 1993. In the fall of 1996, Pikes Peak flipped the station back to a smooth jazz format. This time it was called \\"Sax 105.5\\" and adopted the KSKX call letters. The station remained smooth jazz until News Press & Gazette (NPG) took over the management of the station for a News/Talk format as KRDO-FM in August 2006. In 2015, Optima Communications sold KRDO-FM to NPG. KRDO-FM call sign history The KRDO-FM call letters had previously been used on 95.1 MHz in the Colorado Springs radio market, the original sister station to AM 1240 KRDO. That FM station signed on in 1969 broadcasting a beautiful music format. In 1994 KRDO-FM dropped easy listening music and flipped to adult contemporary music, using the moniker \\"Peak 95.1.\\" In 1998 Peak 95.1 evolved into a Hot AC format which it maintained until Citadel Broadcasting (now Cumulus Media) took over operations of the station in the early 2000s. When the Cumulus-owned station gave up the KRDO-FM call letters in 2006, Pikes Peak Broadcasting acquired that call sign for 105.5. The 95.1 frequency is now home to Cat Country 95.1 KATC-FM.

Professor Alan Fairlamb, and his team study the protozoan parasites causing three different diseases - sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. He was one of the 250 scientists involved in the genome sequencing of these parasites. In 1985, Alan Fairlamb discovered a unique thiol compound present in these parasites, and named it trypanothione. This thiol metabolite is quite different from its human equivalent, glutathione. Trypanothione allows the parasites to fend off free radicals and other toxic oxidants produced by the immune system of the infected patient, and was shown to be vital for parasite survival and virulence. For instance, antimonials neutralize the Leishmania parasite's antioxidant defence system, allowing the patient to clear the infection. Studies on the effect of drugs on trypanothione metabolism resulted in the discovery that fexinidazole is a potential oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. Since 2006, Alan Fairlamb and Mike Ferguson have been co-directors of the Drug Discovery Unit at the University of Dundee.

In 1953, KRDO put a TV station on the air, Channel 13 KRDO-TV, as Colorado Springs' NBC TV Network affiliate.Telecasting Yearbook 1953 page 73 (The TV station today is an ABC TV affiliate.) By the late 1960s, KRDO got a daytime power boost to 1,000 watts. But it still had to reduce power at night to 250 watts. In 1969, an FM station was put on the air, 95.1 KRDO-FM, a beautiful music outlet. In 1975, KRDO joined NBC's News and Information Service to become an all-news radio station.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-32 When that service was discontinued in 1977, KRDO switched to a middle of the road format of popular music and news, as an affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System.Broadcasting Yearbook 1979 page C-33 and later the RKO Radio Network. By the mid-1980s, the older songs were dropped and the station moved to a full service adult contemporary music format while returning to Mutual Broadcasting and clearing Larry King's evening talk program. In 1985, the FCC allowed KRDO to remain powered at 1,000 watts, both day and night.Broadcasting Yearbook 1986 page B-44 In late 1987, KRDO switched to an oldies sound. In 1991, the station flipped to a country music format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1993 page B-56 By the mid 1990s, the station was broadcasting an all sports format. During most of its run as a Sports Radio stations KRDO carried One On One Sports (later known as Sporting News Radio and today is known as SB Nation Radio).

Bonnington and two sisterships were the largest sternwheelers ever built in British Columbia. Bonnington was partially dismantled in the 1950s, and later sank, making the vessel the largest freshwater wreck site in British Columbia. Design and construction =Need for construction= Steam navigation on the inland lakes of British Columbia was dominated by the River and Lake Service of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Since the early 1890s the River and Lake Service had maintained steamboat service on Okanagan, Arrow and Kootenay lakes. By 1910, with the important exceptions of the composite-hulled Moyie on Kootenay Lake and Minto on the Arrow Lakes, the wooden-hulled steamers of the River and Lake Service were starting to wear out and would need replacement. This time however the hulls of the replacements would be made of steel, although the cabins would be built of wood. It was also planned to greatly increase the passenger capacity of the vessels. The goal was to develop the entire Kootenay and Arrow Lakes area into a major tourist destination, as the C.P.R. had done with BanffDowns, Art, Paddlewheels on the Frontier -- The Story of British Columbia and Yukon River Sternwheel Steamers, at 13-14, 129-130, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1972 =Similar vessels built at same time= Bonnington was a near twin of the steamers Naskookin and Sicamous built shortly afterwards on Kootenay and Okanagan lakes respectively. Unusually for a sternwheeler, Bonnington was equipped with compound steam engines, which were manufactured by Polson Iron Works of Toronto, Ontario. The vessel's steel hull was also manufactured by Polson Iron Works and was then shipped in pieces to Nakusp where it was assembled at the Bulger shipyard and the upper works, built of wood, were constructed. =Design innovations= Launching of Bonnington at Nakusp, BC, April 1911 Dining salon on Bonnington While there were many variations, a typical steamer of the inland lakes, and in fact of most of British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest, had three decks. * The main deck, sometimes called the freight or weather deck, carried the boiler, and the engines for the vessel, as well as crew quarters, the kitchen, and space for freight. * The saloon or passenger deck, typically had a large common area overlooking the bow. Down the middle of the cabin would be the saloon, which was not a bar but a large dining room. Passenger cabins flanked the saloon all the way to the stern, where there would generally be another large common area. Typically one common area would be called the \\"ladies saloon\\" while the other would be the smoking saloon, which by customs of the time meant men only. * The Texas or hurricane deck, was the topmost deck on the typical steamer. The ship's lifeboats would be placed on this deck. On this deck sometimes a third set of cabins would be placed, called the \\"texas\\". Generally the Texas was reserved for cabins of the ship's officers, but sometimes, as in the case of Minto the Texas would include passenger cabins. * The pilot house, where the ship's wheel was located, was usually placed either in front of or on top of the Texas. The advantage of having the pilot house on top of the Texas was improved visibility, while the disadvantage was increased windage. Bonnington would break the three-deck pattern and, with Nasookin and Sicamous become the only sternwheel steamer with four decks to run in the Pacific Northwest. These three vessels were built with deck called the \\"gallery\\" deck above the saloon and below the Texas deck. This was called the \\"gallery\\" deck because the cabins on it opened onto a walk or gallery that overlooked the dining room on the saloon deck below. This created high ceiling in the dining room and was a dramatic architectural effect. The locomotive-type boiler installed in Bonnington was in diameter and long. This was probably the largest boiler of this type ever to have been built in Canada up to that time. The capacity of boilers to generate steam was measured by the grate area, meaning the size of the fire-box or fuel burning part of the boiler, and the heating surface, which is the total area heated by the fire available to generate steam. In the case of Bonnington the grate area of the boiler was over and the heating surface was . The boiler consumed up to 3,800 pounds of fuel in an hour, which over the approximately from Arrowhead to Robson meant a fuel consumption of approximately 15 tons of coal. As with the boiler, the engines for Bonnington were also the largest ever built for a sternwheeler in Canada.Parent, Milton, Bouliane, Lou and Wendy, Shipwrecks and Underwater Archaeology -- Bonnington, Royal British Columbia Museum (accessed 2008-04-14). Bonnington is also the name of a house team in St Helens school in Northwood. There is also a mna called Charles Bonnington. The components of the hull were shipped out from Ontario in 19 freight cars. The hull itself was divided into 20 watertight compartments, and to allow as shallow a draft as possible, the bottom of the hull was almost perfectly flat. The compound steam engines were highly efficient and had been employed in many ships, but they had never been used before on a sternwheeler. Bonnington's sternwheel was in diameter and had 20 buckets, which was the steamboat word for paddles. There were 62 staterooms on the steamer, all with electric light and steam heat. The dining room was long and seated 60 people. In addition to the ladies cabin and the smoking room, Bonnington had two observation rooms on the gallery deck, one forward and one aft. There was another lounge and officers and passenger cabins on the Texas deck. Overall Bonnington was regarded as a luxurious vessel and the apex of the steamboat era of travel in British Columbia. Arrow Lakes service Bonnington on Arrow Lakes Bonnington under way on Arrow Lakes Bonnington ran on the Arrow Lakes route from Arrowhead to Robson West during the summer seasons from 1911 to 1931. The summer season was the busiest time for tourism and other traffic, and ran from approximately 15 May to 30 September of each year. While Bonnington was big, she was not particularly fast, and the C.P.R.'s older all-wooden sternwheeler Rossland could easily outrun her. The size of Bonnington was not always an operating advantage, as her huge superstructure made her difficult to handle in a crosswind. Also, while her steel hull gave her ice resistance that wooden-hulled vessels lacked, the winter was also a time of low water in the Narrows that separated the upper and lower Arrow Lakes. While Bonnington had a shallow draft for a vessel her size, only deep, that was still too much to negotiate narrows at low water, so Bonnington could not traverse the length of the lakes during the winter months of low water. Decline of steamboat business Bonnington loading troops at Nakusp 1915 The years of World War I (1914–1918) were hard on the steamboats, as the young men that would otherwise man them or work at businesses in the area volunteered for military service, and travel and tourism fell off in general. Bonnington and other steamers did carry troops recruited locally to military training, but this work could not make up for the general decline in business. Bonnington was to be the last sternwheeler built on the Arrow Lakes. As railroads and roads entered the area, and people moved to the cities, business went into decline, so that by 1930, there were only three vessels running passenger service on the Arrow Lakes, the Bonnington, the Minto and the all-purpose propeller steamboat Columbia. Withdrawn from Canadian Pacific Railway service Bonnington with her large crew and high expenses, could not survive the Great Depression, which caused tourist traffic to fall off considerably. Bonnington withdrawn from service after the season of 1931, and laid up at Nakusp, where the vessel remained for a long time and slowly deteriorated. Later years Bonnington was able to serve as a spare parts source for the other vessels of her class, her boiler and smokestack being later installed in the sistership Nasookin, then being run as a ferry on Kootenay Lake. To facilitate this, on 31 July 1942, Bonnington was sold to Nasookin's new owner, the British Columbia Department of Public Works, for $15,306. On 10 June 1944, Bonnington was sold to Frank W. Sutherland, of Arrowhead. This proved unfortunate for history, as in Sutherland's own words: There were rumors that the vessel would be towed to Robson and converted to an entertainment hall, but this did not occur. On 26 February 1952 Bonnington was sold to James Millar of Beaton (not far from Arrowhead). Some use was made of Bonnington as a ferry in the 1950s following the installation of diesel engines. Wreck site of the Bonnington Over the course of a number of years, Bonnington was partially dismantled at Beaton, and in 1960 the hull filled with water and sank near the shore.The H.W. McCurdy Marine History states at page 379 that Bonnington was dismantled in 1926. This is certainly incorrect, as the vessel remained in regular C.P.R. service until 1931. In the 1990s, the wreck was located and explored by members of the Underwater Archaeology Society of British Columbia and found to be remarkably intact. Bonnington is the largest freshwater shipwreck site in British Columbia. In the words of historians Parent, Bouliane, and Bouliane: Surviving vessel of class Of the three large sternwheelers built by the C.P.R, Bonnington, Nasookin, and Sicamous, one vessel does survive, Sicamous which is preserved as a museum ship at Penticton, British Columbia. Unfortunately the enormous cabin structure of Sicamous was cut down somewhat in her later years of operation, but even so the great size of this class of inland vessels is still apparent to anyone who visits Sicamous today.

It was licensed by Dark Horse Comics for English language release in the North America in July 2007. Synopsis The protagonist of the series is a shy young girl named Shizuka and her outgoing male friend Mamoru. The series revolves around Shizuka's high school life after she contracts \\"Translucent Syndrome\\", a mysterious condition which has only one symptom: The victim's body randomly turns translucent (and later completely invisible), but is otherwise left perfectly normal and healthy. Unfortunately for Shizuka, there is no known cure or treatment for Translucent Syndrome, other than it is tied to the emotional state of the person affected; positive emotions like happiness and love cause it to retract, negative emotions like stress and sadness cause it to accelerate. Initially Shizuka's condition only affects her arms and legs, and only partially, at seemingly randomly times and durations. However, as it worsens it begins to affect her entire body, leaving her increasingly more translucent and for increasingly longer random periods of time. Shizuka is also in danger of gaining \\"Fully Transparent Syndrome\\", or otherwise having her translucency become permanent, which will occur if she spends too long a stretch in her translucent stage. Fully Transparent Syndrome is marked by complete and permanent invisibility, rather than the temporary partial invisibility of the normal syndrome. The fictional condition is used in the series as a metaphor for the common childhood anxiety of feeling lonely and disconnected from other people, as well as—through the threat of the condition worsening—a fear of growing up. Characters :The shy 14-year-old main character of the manga. Shizuka contracted the strange \\"Translucent Syndrome\\" 3 years before the manga started,Translucent Vol. 2, US Translation by Dark Horse Comics, Page 197 which cuts her off from both normal social interaction with her peers, and from her dreams of becoming a stage actress. Shizuka is very talented for a young actress, but this is offset by her very timid and insecure nature. She has decided that she wishes to be a \\"cherry tree actress\\" -- one that is mostly ignored unless she is on stage, where she will blossom like a cherry tree. :Mamoru is an outgoing, childish extrovert, who encourages Shizuka to come out of her shell, despite (or because of) her condition. He is a painter, and assists Shizuka in creating better skin tone greasepaint tones to hide her condition when it is minor. He is obsessed with monsters as well as Gundam models. He also likes to create silly games, like walking in lockstep with Shizuka spontaneously, seeing \\"old men\\" in housing architecture, or monsters in cloud formations. Seems to have feelings for Shizuka, but is too immature to articulate them. :An adult friend of Shizuka, whom Shizuka meets during a checkup for her Translucent Syndrome. Keiko's Translucent Syndrome has progressed to the permanent \\"Fully Transparent Syndrome\\" stage, and as such she is completely invisible. She is not drawn at all in most of the manga, instead her trademark glasses, cigarette, and bandanna float in midair. In a small bit of irony, Keiko is a professional glass artist, and comments on Glass's translucency when she is introduced. She also has a boyfriend named Koichi. Koichi (No last name given) :Keiko's on- again/off-again boyfriend. He is an architect, and is fascinated by old buildings. He is also an old fan of Gundam models. He is very similar in personality to Mamoru, only older. (No first name given) :The student body president of Shizuka and Mamoru's school, and a friend of Shizuka's. Ms. Okouchi dislikes the constant attention her family and peers give her, and is jealous of Shizuka's condition. She attempts to get Translucent Syndrome from Shizuka, but cannot due to Translucent Syndrome being non-contagious. Later, she attempts to further Mamoru and Shizuka's relationship, growing increasingly frustrated (up to and including drop kicking, which she starts to do as a running gag) with Mamoru's obliviousness. She also seems to have a slight crush on Mamoru herself. Dr. Momoko Takazawa :The world's foremost expert in Translucent Syndrome, and Shizuka's doctor. Dr. Takazawa is a young woman who takes an interest in furthering Shizuka and Mamoru's relationship. She enjoys teasing Shizuka with more than slight sexual innuendo, for example asking her if Shizuka and Mamoru have had sex, and insinuating that Shizuka is perfectly healthy, except for her breast size. However, her intentions appear to be noble, as she recognizes that Mamoru is having a healthy effect on Shizuka's Translucent Syndrome, primarily her emotional state.  US Localization Delay  In a post on the Dark Horse Forums, Philip Simon, the editor behind the US translation of Translucent announced an ETA of Translucent, Books 4 and 5—Vol. 4 on sale July 2009, and Vol. 5 (the final volume) on sale November 2009. Anticipating a reaction due to the extreme delay (Volume 4 will be translated 11 months after said forum post, and just over 18 months after Volume 3's release), he said \\"\\"Why the wait with some of these?\\" you may ask. Well, I had to find new translators after three great teammates had to bow out of their projects. Tried out several possibilities, found two amazing new translators, and now we're on our way to finishing these series off!\\" A later reply notified readers that the translation is on hiatus, with Mr. Simon expressing a desire to get the series back into production at some later date.
