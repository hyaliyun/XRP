History The idea of the Adria pipeline was first discussed in 1964 by Yugoslav officials. The plan proposed in October 1965 foresaw a pipeline with a capacity of about 10 million tonnes per annum to supply Yugoslav refineries in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Vojvodina in Serbia with a branch line to the Hungarian border or through Ljubljana to Graz in Austria. The project foresaw to supply refineries in Sisak, Lendava, Bosanski Brod, Novi Sad and Panƒçevo. In June 1966 it was published that the pipeline was to have a diameter of and that the first long section would lead from Bakar or Rijeka to Sisak. The annual capacity of the Bakar-Sisak section was scheduled to 17 million tonnes. From Sisak, the long northern branch was to be extend to the border town of Botovo, from the Hungarian pipeline between Nagykanizsa and Budapest. The long eastern branch was to be extend to Bosanski Brod on the Sava River, and from there for about to the Danubian port of Vukovar. A completion date for the Bosanski Brod-Vukovar section was set on 1 May 1968. In addition, a branch from Bosanski Brod to the Danubian port of Panƒçevo near Belgrade was foreseen. This proposal was supported Croatian authorities and INA oil company. Another proposal about a long pipeline from the port of Ploƒçe through Sarajevo to Bosanski Brod and then to Vukovar, preferred by Bosnian and Serbian authorities and companies, was disapproved. In 1966, Czechoslovakia offered to participate in the construction of the northern branch of Adria pipeline by supplying pipes and equipment. This offer was accepted in July 1967. Early in June 1967, preliminary talks began between Yugoslav and Austrian experts about a Bakar-Vienna pipeline (via Hungary) with a total annual capacity of 22 million tonnes. Another proposal was about an extension of the planned Yugoslav-Hungarian section to Austria. At the same time, construction of the eastern branch from Bosanski Brod to Vukovar started. In 1968, the route from Bakar through Hungary to Bratislava was decided. On 7 May 1968, Czechoslovak signed a memorandum with Iran called for the supply of 15 to 20 million tonnes over a 10 year period, beginning in 1970. By August 1968 an agreement between the Yugoslav, Hungarian and Czechoslovak participants was reached on the joint construction of the Bakar-Sisak-Hungary pipeline. A joint enterprise was to be created for the construction and operation of the pipeline. The pipeline was to go into operation early in 1971. At the end of 1968, Austria become tied into the Trieste-Ingolstadt pipeline and lost its interest to the Adria pipeline. Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland became more interested about the expansion of Druzhba pipeline and construction of the Trieste-Vienna-Budapest pipeline. Also disagreement between the Yugoslav companies rose as HENA and Energoinvest preferred the Ploƒçe-Sarajevo-Bosanski Brod route. In 1968, a dispute was raised concerning the quality of the large-diameter pipes delivered by Czechoslovakia for the eastern branch of the pipeline. API-5Lx pipes with diameter of were produced by the NHG Kunƒçice rolling mill of Czechoslovakia. Yugoslav partners claimed that these pipes were not calibrated on the ends according to API specifications. In addition. handling with improper loading equipment and shipment between Bratislava and Osijek on improperly adapted ships resulted in damage to many pipe-ends, which meant that welding frequently could not be carried out on the site. This led to higher production costs. The Bosanski Brod‚ÄìVukovar section was put into trial operation on 29 April 1969. In 1969, the Yugoslav oil company Naftagas (now Naftna Industrija Srbije), the Czechoslovak enterprise Hidrostav, and the United States engineering company Bechtel signed an agreement on joint engineering planning of the Adriatic link and the northern branch. In October 1969, it was agreed that the northern branch of Adria pipeline would be operational by the beginning of 1974. The total capacity was given as 17 million tonnes annually, with Yugoslavia receiving 10 million, Czechoslovakia 5 million and Hungary and Poland 2 million tonnes each. It was also agreed to extend the northern branch to Poland. In 1973, Yugoslavia's three biggest oil companies INA, Energoinvest and Naftagas agreed construction of the pipeline from Omi≈°alj port near Rijeka to the main industrial centers around Zagreb and Belgrade with the northern branch of the pipeline to be connected with the Hungarian and Czechoslovak pipeline system, while the eastern branch to be connected with the Rumanian system. Each of the companies agreed to bear one third of the total costs. A joint committee (Jugoslavenski naftovod, later Jadranski naftovod) was established to managed construction and later the operation of the pipeline. The agreement between Yugoslavia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia was signed on 12 February 1974. The pipeline was to be constructed in two phases. In the initial phase, expected to be completed by the end of 1976, all pipelines and oil pools were to be constructed at Omi≈°alj, and in the second phase by 1978 all other installations and storage tanks were to be completed to enable the unloading capacity of 34 million tonnes of crude oil annually. At this stage, the pipeline was expected to cost US$350 million, of which Yugoslavia was to provide $30 million, and Hungary and Czechoslovakia $25 million each. The rest of the cost were expected to be financed by the World Bank loan. In 1975, the expected cost was increased up to $412 million. A new financing scheme was agreed according to which Kuwait was to provide $125 million, Libya $70 million, the World Bank $49 million, Hungary and Czechoslovakia $25 million each, and Yugoslavia $118 million. Construction was scheduled to begin in the spring of 1976, and the first phase, was to be finished in 1978. The construction of the Adria pipeline started in 1984 and it became fully operational at the end of 1989 (alternative sources cite 1990). In 1991, as a result of the Croatian War of Independence and other Yugoslav wars, the operation of the Adria pipeline was stopped and the facilities were mothballed and maintained in operational condition by the transit countries. The northern branch of Adria pipeline was re-opened at the end of 1995 and used since then occasionally mainly in reverse mode. Description The Adria pipeline starts at the Omi≈°alj Oil Terminal. From Omi≈°alj the main line runs to Sisak, while spur pipelines connects terminal and refinery in Urinj. In Sisak the northern and eastern branches are split. The norther branch runs further to Virje, where branch section runs to Lendava in Slovenia, and Gola, where the pipeline crosses Croatian‚ÄìHungarian border. It continues through Hungary up to the Duna refinery in Sz√°zhalombatta, where it is connected with the southern line of Druzhba and the Druzhba's branch between Hungary and Slovakia. The annual capacity of Hungarian section is 10 million tonnes of oil per annum. The maximum rated capacity in the Slovak section is at 3.68 million tonnes per year. The eastern branch runs from Sisak to Slavonski Brod. From there, the branch section runs to Bosanski Brod in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the main line continues to Sotin at the Croatian‚ÄìSerbian border. In Serbia, the pipeline runs to Novi Sad and further to Panƒçevo. Further connections The Druzhba Adria project suggested the connection of Adria pipeline with the Druzhba pipeline. By this, Russia would have direct connection to the Omi≈°alj harbor for its oil export. Due to objections for environmental reasons it was not yet realized. As an alternative, the combination of Druzhba Adria with the proposed Pan-European Pipeline has been suggested for transportation of Russian oil to Trieste.

It was built in 1907 at a cost of $650,000.00. The building was occupied by the Rhode Island National Guard from its opening until 1996. Since then, parts of the building have been used as film studios, and some of its offices occupied by the Rhode Island State Fire Marshal. The National Trust for Historic Preservation listed the Armory as one of \\"America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places\\" in its annual list for 1997.America's 11 Most Endangered Properties (1997), National Trust for Historic Preservation https://savingplaces.org/11most-past-listings Its distinctive yellow bricks, crenellated turrets, and decorative stonework mark it as a historically significant building and neighborhood icon.

After World War I, the armory was used by 243rd Coast Artillery, 103rd Field Artillery Brigade, and in later years by the 43rd and 118th as well.Seth Brown, Rhode Island curiosities quirky characters, roadside oddities & other offbeat stuff (Guilford, CT. : Globe Pequot Press, 2007), p. 10 The films Outside Providence (1999) and Underdog (2007) were filmed using the open areas within the Armory for bluescreen work, as well as exterior shots of adjacent areas. The Armory was used for several years by the Rhode Island Interscholastic League to host indoor track and field meets including the Rhode Island state championships and the Brown Invitational track meet. Decline In 1981 the main hall was closed to public events due to structural problems. The National Guard however did not have the funds for the extensive repairs and upkeep required by the buildings age. As of 1986 the Cranston Street Armory was home to the following Rhode Island National Guard units: *Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 103d Field Artillery Brigade *Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 1st Battalion, 103rd Field Artillery Regiment *Service Battery, 1st Battalion, 103rd Field Artillery Regiment *A Battery, 1st Battalion, 103rd Field Artillery Regiment *Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 43rd Military Police Brigade *Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 118th Military Police Battalion *119th Military Police Company Around 1990 the tenant units were transferred to other armories. The Field Artillery units were moved to the Armory of Mounted Commands in Providence and the Military Police units were moved to the Warwick Armory in Warwick. In 1996 the State of Rhode Island took over the property, and the National Guard moved out the following year. After the state passed tax incentives to encourage filming in Rhode Island the armory served a brief stint as a sound stage. In 2004 a proposed bond issue to finance renovation and restoration of the armory was placed on the ballot and supported by the West Broadway Neighborhood Association, but did not pass. In recent years, the building has hosted car shows, inaugural balls, track meets and home shows, and currently houses the office of the state fire marshal, and storage space for other R.I. state agencies. Today the building is in desperate need of repair. A small part of the building on the Parade Street side is occupied by the State of Rhode Island Fire Marshal and Bomb Squad, the main hall is used for storage. In 2014 Governor Chafee announced that the state would cut back on a renovation plan, and a state Senator proposed adding $3 million to the state budget for repairs. In January 2015, Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza held his inauguration gala in the building. A few weeks later, it was named as one of 2015's \\"Most Endangered Properties\\" by the Providence Preservation Society, one of many times it has earned that distinction. Broadway‚ÄìArmory Historic District Armory Park, aka Dexter Training Ground The Cranston Street Armory has lent its name to the surrounding area of Providence's West End, which is often known as the \\"Broadway‚ÄìArmory Historic District.\\" Several area businesses also take their name from this building. Most of the buildings in the area were built around 1840 to 1920. Dexter Training Ground Statue of Ebenezer Knight Dexter The Armory stands at the southern end of the Dexter Training Ground, a plot of land which was donated to the City of Providence by Ebenezer Knight Dexter for holding military exercises. The Training Ground was used as an encampment and drill field during the Civil War. The 14th Rhode Island Heavy Artillery Regiment, the first Black company from Rhode Island to serve in the Civil War, trained and camped here. In July 1917, doughboys camped at Dexter Training Ground as they prepared to depart for Europe and World War I. Today the land is a heavily used neighborhood park. The park features a playground, and attracts dog walkers and strollers. A statue of benefactor and namesake Ebenezer Knight Dexter stands in the northern end of the park. In July 2020, mayor Jorge Elorza held an outdoor ceremony in Dexter Training Ground where he signed an executive order to come up with a ‚Äútruth- telling and reparations process‚Äù in Providence.

It was discovered by the HATNet Project team in 2009 using the transit method, and submitted for publication on 2 January 2009. This planet is located approximately away Discovery The HATNet Project team initially detected the transits of HAT-P-11b from analysis of 11470 images, taken in 2004 and 2005, by the HAT-6 and HAT-9 telescopes. The planet was confirmed using 50 radial velocity measurements taken with the HIRES radial velocity spectrometer at W. M. Keck Observatory. At the time of its discovery HAT-P-11b was the smallest radius transiting extrasolar planet discovered by a ground based transit search and was also one of three previously known transiting planets within the initial field of view of the Kepler spacecraft. There was a linear trend in the radial velocities indicating the possibility of another planet in the system. This planet, HAT-P-11c, was confirmed in 2018. Characteristics This planet orbits about the same distance from the star as 51 Pegasi b is from 51 Pegasi, typical of transiting planets. However, the orbit of this planet is eccentric, at around 0.198, unusually high for hot Neptunes. HAT-P-11b's orbit is also highly inclined, with a tilt of 103¬∞. degrees relative to its star's rotation. The planet fits models for 90% heavy elements. Expected temperature is 878 ¬± 15K. Actual temperature must await calculations of secondary transit. On 24 September 2014, NASA reported that HAT-P-11b is the first Neptune-sized exoplanet known to have a relatively cloud-free atmosphere and, as well, the first time molecules, namely water vapor, of any kind have been found on such a relatively small exoplanet. In 2009 French astronomers observed what was thought to be a weak radio signal coming from the exoplanet. In 2016 scientists from the University of St Andrews set out to solve the mystery. They assumed that the signal was real and was coming from the planet and investigated whether it can be produced by lightning on HAT-P-11b. Assuming that the underlying physics of lightning is the same for all Solar System planets, like Earth and Saturn, as well as on HAT-P-11b, the researchers found that 3.8 √ó 10^6 lightning flashes of Saturnian lightning-strength in a square kilometre per hour would explain the observed radio signal on HAT-P-11b. This storm would have been so enormous that the largest thunderstorms on Earth or Saturn would have produced <1% of the strength of the signal coming from the planet.

The Siahan Range is primarily made up of limestone and sandstone and was formed when the north western Indian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate. A map depicting the Indian Plate. The Asian Plate, highlighted in gray. Geography The total length of the Siahan Range from Shireza to the western frontier is about . The highest point of the range is on the east and is Razak (6758 ft): other peaks are Mughal Pabb (5979 ft) and Choto-e-Jik (5874 ft); westward the range decreases in height to about 5000 ft. Sub-ranges and ridges The Siahan Range,(Lat 27.41667 Long 64.5) from the term applied to the western extremity of the range, is the name which may be given to the long ridge which separate Kharan from the valley of the Rakshan River and eventually fades westward into the hills of Iranian Balochistan. The range has never been thoroughly explored. It consists of two ridges: *the southern one runs west-south-west from a point near Shireza *on the north a parallel one starts from the desert east of Washuk in Kharan District and tends westward toward Dizzak in Iran, where it is known as the Siahan or the Siahan koh. It is from this range that the name for the whole mass has been taken. It forms the main ridge at the western extremity of the mass, but at the eastern end, a more southerly range predominates. The eastern end of the range is variously known merely as Band, or as the Kharan-rakshan Lath, while on the west and north of Panjgur it is known as the Koh-e-Sabz. The Koh-e-Sabz is only well defined to the west of the Korkian Pass, from which place it gradually rises to a height of nearly 5400 ft before it is crossed by the defile known as the Tank-e-Grawag. On the other hand, the Kharan- Rakshan Lath descends gradually toward Jang-ja-e-gajiun in Panjgur, and forms the hilly country between the latter place and the Koh-e-Sabz. It follows, therefore, that a traveler to the Kharan plain on the north, from the part of the Rakshan basin which lies to the east of the Korkian Pass, must cross two main ridges, while immediately north of Panjgur he must traverse three, viz. the hilly country consisting of the extremity of the eastern main range and lying between Panjgur and the Koh-e-sabz; the Koh-e-Sabz and the Siahan or Siahan Koh proper. The northern ridge between Washuk and the valley of Palantak torrent is known as the Cher Dem in the Washuk Niabat of the Kharan District. Its height is about 5000 ft. at its western end a well known peak Hetai, which lies to the west of the Tank-e-zurrati through which the Mashkel River breaks northward to the Hamun Mashkel. Geology Geologically the Siahan Range has never been fully studied but its general aspect is abrupt, rugged and broken. The Koh-e-sabz portion is composed of shale and volcanic rock, contorted in many places into fantastic shapes with synclinal and anticlinal curves. The shale which lies throughout in perpendicular parallel layers or at a slight angle to its base, gives the hill a very sharp and jagged appearance, but though difficult they are not unscalable, very steep and precipitous escarpments being rare and generally limited to the sides. The range being on consolidated upheaval, there are no valleys ascents and descents from one ridge to another being made by following the rivulets. Drainage The Rakshan tributary of the Mashkel River carries off all the drainage from the southern slopes. On the north a number of hill torrents descend, either to lose themselves in the Kharan Plain or to join the Mashkel River. Some of the more important are the Gujjar, the Regintak, the Gresha Kaur, the Palantak, the Pillin, the Bibi Lohri and the Barshonki. Of the two gorges already mentioned the Tank-e-Grawag lies in the Koh-e-Sabz and the Tank-e-Zurrati in the northern ridge of the Siahan Koh. The former is so termed from the reeds called Grawag which grow here in great abundance. There is also a small patch of cultivation where a few date palms grow at the point where it makes its first turn. It is six miles in length and is easily passable when the river is low, but is subject to great and violent floods. The latter is just over eight miles long and of medium width, being nowhere less than 80 yards and generally nearly 150. The perpendicular cliffs which enclose it are about 200 feet in height. Quicksands exist at some of the fords and there is perennial water in both defiles. People The range possesses no permanent inhabitants; among the nomads who pasture their flocks on it are the Muhammad Hasnis, Nasrois, Bullozais, Sopaks and Hajizais of the Rakshan valley and a few people from Kuhak called Siahani. Some nomads from Kharan Plain also visit it, chiefly Rikis and Kuchai Siahpad and Taghapi Rakshanis. Footpaths and trails The range is crossed by numerous footpaths and trails, which are used by Balochistani people, including the Simmij, Sabzap, Kasag, Miani, Sorani, and Sechi. Commencing from the east the passes chiefly used by people are the Zard, to the northwest of Shireza; the Paliaz north of Nag-e-Kalat; and the Sagar-e-Kandag and Korkian passes on the road from Panjgur to Washuk. The Hetai is an important pass north of Tank-e-Grawag, on the road from Panjgur to Dehgwar in Kharan. Flora The range is predominantly desert habitats. Many of the seasonally torrential river channels contain Tamarix, and some Asafoetida. The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) flourishes in oasis and irrigated locations.

The Maddale () also called Mrudanga(‡≤Æ‡≥É‡≤¶‡≤Ç‡≤ó) in North Canara region is a percussion instrument from Karnataka, India. It is the primary rhythmic accompaniment in a Yakshagana ensemble along with Chande. Maddale also represents a remarkable progress in percussive instruments as it produces the perfectly hormonic tonic (shruti swara) when played anywhere on the surface compared to Mrudangam, Pakawaj or Tabla that can not produce the tonic (shruti) on all parts of the drum surface. The traditional variety of Maddale was 30 cm long, had 8 inch drum head for right and produced the louder sound. These days 6 - 6.5 inch wide right side maddale is used with only a few using 7 inch wide. Left bass side is about an inch (few hairs less) bigger than right. Maddale is available in more than three different variations.Dr. Shivarama Karantha, Yakshagana Bayalaata, Harsha Publications, 1963, Puttur, South Canara. Maddale used in Yakshagana looks similar to mridangam but is markedly different in structure, acoustics, playing techniques and the rhythm system (Yakshagana Tala).Prof. Sridhara Uppura, Yakshagana and Nataka, Diganta Sahitya Publications, 1998, Managalore. History Maddale belongs to mridangam family of drums and hence shares the history of similar drums. Its drum head is similar to tabla and the drum itself is similar to pakhavaj. Over the years, the Maddale evolved to be made of different kinds of wood and for higher octave, and today, its body is constructed from wood of the jackfruit tree among other woods like kakke, baine, hunaalu. Its use has evolved with the development of Yakshagana and Yakshaganic fingering and hand techniques have been developed. Use of palm produces a sound that is somewhat a mixture of pakhawaj and mridangam. Physical components Yakshagana Maddale Bala Muchchige. Yakshagana Maddale left drum head (bass). Left side is slightly larger The maddale is a double-sided drum whose body is usually made using a hollowed piece of jackfruit wood about half a cm thick (this is very thin compared to Mrudangam). This body is called Goodu(or housing). The two open ends of the drum are covered with a goat skin leather and laced to each other with leather straps around the circumference of the drum. These straps are stretched to tightly hold the drum heads on either side of the drum body, allowing them to resonate when struck. The drum head on the left is slightly larger (bass side) (about say 90% of an inch). One side produces bass another treble. The drum head is known as muchchige. The bass drum head is known as the eda muchchige and the drum head is known as the bala muchchige. The right drum head is similar to tabla drum head but differs slightly creating a major tonal difference. The maddale unlike Mrudangam, Parkwaj or Tabla produces tonic when playing on the rim and on ink. The left drum head produces lower pitched bass sounds. The right drum head has a circular disk in the centre called karne or the ink causing the drum to produce harmonic tones. The left drum is smeared with a tuning paste made from ash and rice called bona, before the performance to dampen the tone and to produce bass sound.  Methods of use Maddale is tuned to the tonic of the Yakshagana singer before the performance (lower shadja). A wooden peg is sometimes used to tighten the leather straps. Two major strokes are called Gumpu and Chapu. Playing on the rim is called Chapu this is used for tuning. Playing on the ink to produce a more resonating sound is called Gumpu. The cross finger stroke above the ink is called the Kapala stroke which is a unique stroke that produces a hormonic mix of Gumpu and chapu (a stroke different from are chapu of mrudangam - Kapala is more musical in quality).

History The company's origins go back to 1761 when Buckland Mill in Dover in Kent commenced operations. Meanwhile, in France, in the middle of the 20th century there were four competing paper mills that manufactured sophisticated paper products with high added value, especially security papers (banknotes, passports, etc.). A joint merger plan was drawn up in 1954 and led to the formation of the first French paper-manufacturing group: ARJOMARI. The name of the group came from the first two letters of the names of the paper mills participating in the merger: Arches, Johannot, Marais, Rives.1492 to 1956‚Ä¶The roots: From Arches to Arjomari In 1890 Buckland Mill was bought by Wiggins Teape a business formed by Edward Wiggins and Henry Teape when they incorporated their paper milling business some 40 years earlier. In 1970 the Company was acquired by BAT Industries who went on to acquire Appleton Papers of the US in 1978. The business expanded rapidly in the 1980s as it exploited the market in carbonless paper. In 1989 the UK and US paper businesses were demerged from BAT Industries and integrated to form Wiggins Teape Appleton. In 1990 it acquired the Catalan paper company Guarro, one of the oldest in the world, founded in 1698 and established in the town of Gelida.

A perfluorinated compound (PFC) is an organofluorine compound containing only carbon-fluorines and C-C bonds but also other heteroatoms. PFCs have properties that result from the presence of fluorocarbons (containing only C‚ÄìF and C‚ÄìC bonds) and the functional group. Common functional groups in PFCs are OH, CO2H, chlorine, O, and SO3H. Applications Perfluorinated compounds are used ubiquitously: For example, fluorosurfactants are widely used in the production of teflon (PTFE) and related fluorinated polymers. They confer hydrophobicity and stain-resistance to fabrics. They are components of fire-fighting foam. Fluorosurfactants (PFAS) reduce surface tension by concentrating at the liquid-air interface due to the lipophobicity of polyfluorocarbons. Chlorofluorocarbons are perfluorinated compounds that were formerly used as refrigerants (Freon) until they were implicated in ozone degradation.  Production  A common industrial method for synthesizing perflurocompounds is electrofluorination.

Environmental and health concerns Several environmental and health concerns surrround the industrial production and use of perfluoroalkane compounds. The exceptional stability of perfluorinated compounds is desirable from the applications perspective is also a cause for environmental and health concerns.  Perfluoroalkanes  Low-boiling perfluoroalkanes are potent greenhouse gases, in part due to their very long atmospheric lifetime. The environmental concerns for perflurocompounds are similar to chlorofluorocarbons and other halogenated compounds used as refrigerants and fire suppression materials. The history of use, environmental impact, and recommendations for use are included in the Kyoto Protocol. Fluorosurfactants The fluorocarbons PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate) have both been investigated by the EU and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which regards them being harmful to the environment. Specifically, studies found that PFOS caused \\"unusual and serious effects in animal toxicity tests,\\" that it was present around the world in humans and wildlife, and that it was highly persistent in the environment.Auer, Charles, Frank Kover, James Aidala, Marks Greenwood. ‚ÄúToxic Substances: A Half Century of Progress.‚Äù EPA Alumni Association. March 2016. (Similar concerns followed for PFOA.) Fluorosurfactants tend to bioaccumulate, since they are extremely stable and can be stored in the bodies of humans and animals. Examples include PFOA and PFOS, frequently present in water resistant textiles and sprays conferring water resistant properties to textiles and fire-fighting foam. Data from animal studies of PFOA indicate that it can cause several types of tumors and neonatal death and may have toxic effects on the immune, liver, and endocrine systems. data on the human health effects of PFOA were sparse. As of 2015, the U.S. Air Force had been testing 82 former and active US military installations for fluorosurfactants contained in fire fighting foam. In 2015, PFCs were found in groundwater at Naval Air Station Brunswick, Maine and Grissom Air Reserve Base, Indiana, and in well water at Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire, where 500 people including children had blood tests as part of a bio-monitoring plan through the state Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S. Department of Defense's research programs have been trying to define nature and extent of PFAS contamination at U.S. military sites, especially in groundwater.Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs): Analytical and Characterization Frontiers webinarslides, January 28, 2016 A 2018 report to Congress indicated that \\"at least 126 drinking water systems on or near military bases\\" were contaminated with PFAS compounds.

Unlike the classical CLT, which requires that the random variables in question have finite variance and be both independent and identically distributed, Lindeberg's CLT only requires that they have finite variance, satisfy Lindeberg's condition, and be independent. It is named after the Finnish mathematician Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. Statement Let (Omega, mathcal{F}, mathbb{P}) be a probability space, and X_k : Omega to mathbb{R},,, k in mathbb{N}, be independent random variables defined on that space. Assume the expected values mathbb{E},[X_k] = mu_k and variances mathrm{Var},[X_k] = sigma_k^2 exist and are finite. Also let s_n^2 := sum_{k=1}^n sigma_k^2 . If this sequence of independent random variables X_k satisfies Lindeberg's condition: : lim_{n to infty} frac{1}{s_n^2}sum_{k = 1}^n mathbb{E} left[(X_k - mu_k)^2 cdot mathbf{1}_{{  X_k - mu_k  > varepsilon s_n }} right] = 0 for all varepsilon > 0, where 1{‚Ä¶} is the indicator function, then the central limit theorem holds, i.e. the random variables :Z_n := frac{sum_{k = 1}^n (X_k - mu_k)}{s_n} converge in distribution to a standard normal random variable as n to infty. Lindeberg's condition is sufficient, but not in general necessary (i.e. the inverse implication does not hold in general). However, if the sequence of independent random variables in question satisfies :max_{k=1,ldots,n} frac{sigma_k^2}{s_n^2} to 0, quad text{ as } n to infty, then Lindeberg's condition is both sufficient and necessary, i.e. it holds if and only if the result of central limit theorem holds. Remarks=Feller's theorem Feller's theorem can be used as an alternative method to prove that Lindeberg's condition holds.K. B. Athreya, S. N. Lahiri (2006), Measure Theory and Probability Theory. p. 348. Letting S_n := sum_{k=1}^n X_k and for simplicity mathbb{E},[X_k] = 0, the theorem states :if forall epsilon > 0 , lim_{n rightarrow infty} max_{1 leq k leq n} P(X_k > epsilon s_n) = 0 and frac{S_n}{s_n} converges weakly to a standard normal distribution as n rightarrow infty then X_k satisfies the Lindeberg's condition. This theorem can be used to disprove the central limit theorem holds for X_k by using proof by contradiction. This procedure involves proving that Lindeberg's condition fails for X_k. Interpretation Because the Lindeberg condition implies max_{k=1,ldots,n}frac{sigma^2_k}{s_n^2} to 0 as n to infty, it guarantees that the contribution of any individual random variable X_k (1leq kleq n) to the variance s_n^2 is arbitrarily small, for sufficiently large values of n.

It is found in the sublittoral zone of the northern Atlantic Ocean. Description Laminaria digitata Laminaria digitata is a tough, leathery, dark brown seaweed that grows to two or three metres. The holdfast which anchors it to the rock is conical and has a number of spreading root-like protrusions called rhizoids. The stipe or stalk is flexible and oval in cross section and may be over 1 inch in diameter and grow to 5 feet in length.Dickinson, C.I. 1963 British Seaweeds. The Kew Series, The blade is large and shaped like the palm of a hand with a number of more or less regular finger-like segments. This seaweed can be distinguished from the rather similar Laminaria hyperborea by being darker in colour and having a shorter stipe that does not easily snap when bent.Laminaria digitata (Hudson) J.V. Lamouroux The Seaweed Site. Retrieved 2011-09-22. Reproduction The life cycle is of the large diploid sporophytes and microscopic gametophytes. Spores develop in sori which occur over the central part of the blade.Bunker, F.StP.D., Maggs, C.A., Brodie, J.A. and Bunker A.R. 2017, Seaweeds of Britain and Ireland. Second Edition. Wild Nature Press, Plymouth, UK. Distribution Laminaria digitata occurs in the north west Atlantic from Greenland south to Cape Cod and in the north east Atlantic from northern Russia and Iceland south to France. It is common round the coasts of the British Isles except for much of the east coast of England. Ecology Laminaria digitata is found mostly on exposed sites on shores in the lower littoral where it may form extensive meadows and can be the dominant algal species. It has a fairly high intrinsic growth rate compared to other algae, 5.5% per day, and a carrying capacity of about 40 kg wet weight per square meter. It may reach lengths of about 4 m. It overlaps to a small degree in distribution with Fucus serratus and Alaria esculenta. It is highly susceptible to grazing by sea urchins, among other species. It has low and high light limitation values of about 5 and 70 W per square meter respectively. Its distribution is also limited by salinity, wave exposure, temperature, desiccation and general stress. These and other attributes of the alga are summarized in the publications listed below.Seip, K.L. 1980. A mathematical model of competition and colonization in a community of marine benthic algae.

It is used as an ingredient in some cosmetics. It was traditionally used as a fertiliser and spread on the land. In the 18th century it was burnt to extract the potash it contained for use in the glass industry. In the 19th century it was used for the extraction of iodine. Historically, the dried stalks of L digitata, called sea-tangle tents were used in traditional medicine an abortifacient and for mechanically inducing labour.

It consists of approximately 140 assistant prosecutors (attorneys at law), 160 detectives licensed to carry arms, and 125 support staff. ECPO presently processes between 16,000 and 20,000 adult defendants charged with criminal acts per year. In addition, between 3,500 and 5,000 juveniles are processed each year through delinquency proceedings. Most of these defendants are arrested and charged by local or county-level law enforcement agencies, but ECPO also originates charges against defendants through its own investigatory units, and via direct indictment by the Essex County Grand Jury (i.e., charges issued directly by the grand jury and not prior to grand jury review). Between 5,000 and 6,000 adult defendants are indicted in Essex County each year. Essex County currently accounts for about 18% of all criminal (felony) cases referred to county prosecutors' offices in New Jersey. Approximately 35% of the state's homicides and 14% of sexual assaults occur in Essex. The Essex County Prosecutor The position of Essex County Prosecutor was established by the Constitution of the State of New Jersey. The Prosecutor serves as the Chief Law Enforcement Officer in the county. County Prosecutors in New Jersey are appointed by the Governor for a term of five years, and must be affirmed by the State Senate. They are not elected to office, as with equivalent positions (e.g., District Attorney or State's Attorney) in other states. County Prosecutors in New Jersey may be reappointed without term limit. The daily operations of the Office of the Essex County Prosecutor are funded mostly through tax revenues collected by Essex County and budgeted by the Board of Chosen Freeholders, with additional sums garnered from crime forfeitures and from grants made by State and federal agencies. History In 1776, the State of New Jersey ratified its first Constitution (superseded by later Constitutions in 1844 and 1947). Under this Constitution, the elected Governor appointed an Attorney General to enforce the laws of the State. The Attorney General in turn appointed deputies for the various counties, including Essex, to enforce the criminal laws on behalf of the local populace. In 1822, the New Jersey General Assembly passed an act authorizing a more independent Prosecutor of Pleas for each county, to be appointed by the Court of Quarter Sessions once every five years. A few years later, the Governor was given the authority to appoint each county's Prosecutor of Pleas. On February 20, 1829, Amzi Dodd became the first governor-appointed Prosecutor of Pleas for Essex County. The earliest record of a prosecution by Prosecutor Dodd involves ‚Äúa nuisance in suffering the water to stagnate and become offensive in the old burying ground‚Äù in Newark. The first Prosecutor of Pleas worked alone, but by 1877 the Prosecutor required the help of a First Assistant. As Essex County grew and matters became more complex, the Office of the Prosecutor grew in size. By 1922, Essex County Prosecutor John O. Bigelow employed 28 men, including three Assistant Prosecutors, two Detective Captains, two Lieutenants, and various detectives and clerks. In the 1920s and 30's, cases involving gambling, organized crime and official corruption were growing in number. In October 1935, the nationally known organized crime figure Dutch Schultz was shot at the Palace Chop House in Newark. Although the prime suspect was found hanged soon after the incident, the Office continued its investigation and identified Schultz's real shooter who pleaded guilty to the murder in 1940. By 1945, the Office still had only three Assistant Prosecutors, despite a growing number of murder and gambling cases. In 1951, Prosecutor Edward Gaulkin gained attention by successfully prosecuting four men charged with conspiracy, extortion and bribery in the Newark milk scandal case. In 1959, New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner nominated Brendan T. Byrne of West Orange as the 25th Prosecutor of Essex County. Prosecutor (and later Governor) Byrne served the Office until 1967. By 1962, there were 16 Assistant Prosecutors, most of whom were part-time employees. Shortly thereafter, the first female Assistant Prosecutor was appointed. Also during Byrne's tenure, the ‚ÄúCharlie Squad‚Äù was formed, a name coined after members of the public were urged to report illegal gambling by calling a dedicated phone number. Shortly after Prosecutor Byrne left the Office in 1967, the City of Newark experienced a violent week-long civil disturbance, which heralded long-term social and economic change in Essex County. These transformations challenged future Prosecutors to respond to changing patterns of crime, including increased violent crime rates and increased narcotics-related crime. By 1973, the legal staff numbered 63 lawyers, all full-time. County Investigators were increasingly selected from the ranks of experienced local police officers. Under Prosecutor George Schneider (Prosecutor from 1981 to 1986), the number of Assistant Prosecutors exceeded 100. Increasing resources were also dedicated to special squads. The Homicide Squad was expanded and a Narcotics Section, which at first was a joint task force with the Sheriff's Office, was created. Eventually specialized units were established in Child Abuse, Sex Assault, Arson, Domestic Violence, Megan's Law, Gangs, and Economic Crime and Corruption. In 1986, Governor Thomas Kean appointed the first African-American Prosecutor in Essex County (and only the second in the State of New Jersey), Herbert H. Tate, Jr. Computerization of the Office was begun and continued in stages throughout the terms of Prosecutor Tate and his successor, Prosecutor Clifford J. Minor. Also during this time, ECPO also established a Victim Witness Advocacy Office to help crime victims and witnesses cope with the disruption that crime and participation in the criminal justice system can bring. In January, 1998, the first female Prosecutor, Patricia Hurt, was appointed by Governor Christie Todd Whitman. Prosecutor Hurt's tenure was affected by allegations of managerial and fiscal irregularities, and in July 1999, Governor Whitman dismissed Hurt and appointed Acting Prosecutor Donald Campolo from the State Division of Criminal Justice. A variety of other personnel from the State Attorney General's Office helped Campolo oversee ECPO operations for several years. However, in 2003, N.J. Governor James McGreevey appointed Paula T. Dow as Acting Prosecutor and effectively ended State oversight of the Office's daily functioning. In June, 2005, Governor Richard Codey swore Dow to the office of Essex County Prosecutor. Recent developments Since the year 2000, the Essex County Prosecutor's Office has responded to increased auto theft, narcotics and youth gang activity through the formation of special task forces in conjunction with federal, state and multi-state law enforcement agencies. During this time, ECPO also completed a second generation of computerization complete with e-mail and Internet access and increased its outreach to the public through its newly established Community Justice Program and its public web site. ECPO also established a fatal vehicle collision investigation unit, and a program to assure humane treatment and accurate evidence collection from the victims of sexual assault. To respond to increased incidence of witness harassment by street gangs since 2002, ECPO has stepped up its witness protection efforts, and has opened a modern crime scene office to replace a small, outdated facility. The new facility features a forensic processing room, digital photo processing room and a drying chamber designed to process and package blood-soaked evidence. Its computer system is linked to the N.J. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) to identify and match fingerprint evidence. Computer software allows detectives to visually reconstruct crime scenes. In addition to investigating homicides, shootings and sex crimes, the ECPO Crime Scene Unit is able to assist county police departments in burglaries and other criminal investigations. Also during Prosecutor Dow's tenure, the process of handling most criminal cases after arrest and bail-setting was revised from a \\"horizontal\\" structure involving separate departments handling initial evaluation (\\"screening\\"), grand jury presentation, and trial or plea negotiation, to a \\"vertical\\" structure where one team of assistant prosecutors and support staff handles a case from start to finish. By early 2008, the \\"vertical trial units\\" handled most cases, although some cases continue to be handled partly or entirely by the special investigatory units dedicated to arson, sexual assault, domestic violence, narcotics, economic corruption and gang-related cases. High Profile Cases The Essex County Prosecutor's Office has been involved in a variety of high-profile cases that gained national attention over the past twenty five years. In 1985, Kelly Michaels, a child care worker at the Wee Care Nursery School in Maplewood, NJ was arrested on allegations of sexually abusing children. The Essex County Prosecutor's Office helped to investigate the case and brought forth an indictment against Ms. Michaels, setting the stage for a trial. In 1988, the trial jury found Ms. Michaels guilty. However, the Appellate Division of the N.J. Superior Court overturned this verdict citing to a variety of improper prosecutorial practices, and required a new trial. After the N.J. Supreme Court affirmed this decision in 1994, ECPO dropped the indictment against Ms. Michaels. In 1989, a sexual assault case was brought by ECPO against four high school athletes from Glen Ridge, NJ, who were convicted in 1993 for victimizing a 17-year-old developmentally disabled woman. Three were convicted of aggravated sexual assault, and the fourth was convicted on one count of conspiracy. This case was the subject of a popular book, a TV movie, and an episode on the TV show ‚ÄúLaw & Order.‚Äù In April, 1999, during Prosecutor Hurt's tenure, the ECPO participated in the investigation of the shooting death of Orange, NJ Police Officer Joyce Carnegie. Both ECPO and the local police were criticized for the arrest of two suspects, the first alleged to have been held wrongly because of the failure to interview a key alibi witness, and to have been physically mistreated while in custody. A second suspect, Earl Faison, died while in the custody of local police. Five Orange Police Officers were later indicted by a federal grand jury and convicted for violating Faison's civil rights. Another suspect, Condell Woodson, pleaded guilty to Carnegie's murder and was sentenced to life in prison in June, 1999. In January, 2000, a fire occurred in the Boland Hall dormitory of Seton Hall University in South Orange, NJ that caused the deaths of three students and the injuries of 58 students. Two University students were charged with murder and a variety of other counts after being indicted by the Essex County Grand Jury in 2003. In 2007, after years of detailed investigation, Joseph LePore and Sean Ryan were sentenced to five years in prison under a plea agreement. Some local commentators criticized Prosecutor Dow regarding her Office's handling of the case, citing delays and the fact that murder charges had been dropped. However, there were no direct witnesses, and all evidence in this case was forensic, circumstantial or hearsay in nature. In January, 2003, two starving children were discovered in the basement of a shared home by a man who was living there with a woman named Sherry Murphy.France, David, \\"Hell House Revisited\\" (p.3), New York magazine. The mummified remains of a 7-year-old child (Faheem Williams) were later also found in the basement. Murphy was a cousin of the dead child's mother. In September, 2005, Ms. Murphy pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated assault, criminal restraint and endangering the welfare of a child. Ms. Murphy's son Wesley also pleaded guilty to a reckless endangerment charge for a \\"wrestling\\" incident during which Faheem Williams had died about four months before being found.

Built in 1825, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It has been adapted as office space by the Diplomatic and Consular Officers Retired (DACOR) organization. History It was built in 1825 for Tench Ringgold, who was one of a three-member presidential commission charged with supervising the restoration of public buildings in the capital following the War of 1812 and burning by the British. He was also still serving as US Marshal in the District of Columbia, having first been appointed under the President James Monroe administration. From 1832‚Äì1833, Chief Justice John Marshall of the United States Supreme Court resided as a boarder with Ringgold in the house. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story also boarded there, and both men considered Ringgold a friend. In 1835, the house was sold, and a number of prominent people have since lived in the house, including William Thomas Carroll, a clerk at the Supreme Court, for whom the house is also named; Chief Justice Melville Fuller, Senator Joseph Medill McCormick, and Congressman Robert Low Bacon. The Diplomatic and Consular Officers Retired (DACOR) organization now uses the house as office space, and a number of other organizations rent office space in the building as well.

The species is found at sheltered rocky seabeds. Saccharina latissima on a beach. Saccharina lattissima from Avacha Bay Description Saccharina latissima is a yellowish brown colour with a long narrow, undivided blade that can grow to long and wide. The central band is dimpled while the margins are smoother with a wavy edge. The frond is attached to the rock by stout rhizoids about 5 mm in diameter in the intertidal and sublittoral zones by a claw-like holdfast and a short, pliable, cylindrical stipe. Ecology Saccharina latissima is an ecologically important system. It is a primary producer, delivering plant material to the coastal food web. The three-dimensional forests also serve as a habitat for animals, resulting in a high biodiversity. Fish, shellfish and other animals get food and hiding places within these forests.Christie H, Norderhaug KM, Fredriksen S. 2009. Macrophytes as habitat for fauna.

The previous record was set in 1989 by IBM scientists who used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the company initials. Stanford team also used scanning tunneling microscope, however, instead of atoms they went to a subatomic level and used electron waves to write their university initials ‚ÄúSU‚Äù and create the current smallest writing in the world at 0.3 nanometers. This achievement simultaneously sets a record for the density of information. Before this technology was invented the density of information had not exceeded one bit per atom. Researchers of electronic quantum holography however were able to push the limit to 35 bits per electron or 20 bits nm‚àí2.  Technology  A chip of pure copper is inserted into a scanning tunneling microscope and cleaned. Carbon monoxide molecules are then placed onto the surface and moved around. When the electrons in copper bounce off the carbon monoxide molecules they create special interference patterns creating electronic quantum hologram. The projection of this hologram is an electronic object. It is then possible at particular energies to read the individual slices of this object like a stack of pages in a book.

It makes an exception to the Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations 1980, which ordinarily requires that workers are protected by the law of the member state in which they work. After a controversial set of decisions by the European Court of Justice, the Directive has come under criticism for reducing rights of posted workers and undermining the rights of workers in a home nation. Overview The Directive aims to clarify competing claims of competence in the case of staff being sent abroad by their employer for a project (posting), between the rules governing labour relations in the country of origin of the employing service provider and the country where the work is actually carried out (but where the staff is not normally based). If the laws of the country where the work is actually being carried out applied even for short stays, a company wishing to offer its services in the whole of the EU would have to be aware of 27 different sets of rules. This would be a burden in particular for SMEs which would discourage them from taking advantage of the EU's Internal Market. To counter this phenomenon, the European Court of Justice has developed a balancing mechanism on the basis of the Treaty that determines which country's rules apply in a given situation. However, this case-by-case approach generates legal uncertainty which is tackled by this Directive. To protect workers from one EU country who are sent by their employer to carry out work in another temporarily, the Directive provides that a 'hard core' of rules of the host country (country of destination) needs to be observed. The Directive was first adopted in 1996. The directive applies where, *a company agrees to provide a service to a client in another Member State and needs to send staff there in order to carry out this work *a worker is posted to another country through arrangements within a group of companies, with the parent and subsidiaries based in different member states *a worker is posted through an agreement between an employer and an employment agency The member state hosting a posted worker must ensure he is protected by the minimum standards in article 3(1). These are, *working time (hours, holidays, pay) *standards applicable to agency workers *health and safety *pregnancy and maternity protection *discrimination law *in the building and construction trades, collective agreement standards that 'have been declared universally applicable' across a geographical areaDirk R√ºffert v Land Niedersachsen [2008] IRLR 467 (C-446/06) decided that this did not include a German law allowing the state government to give mandatory effect to a building sector collective agreement because it did not cover all undertakings in the region and industry However, these limited set of rights must also been read within the context of TFEU art 56 (ex TEC art 49) on the freedom of establishment, and also the right to freedom of association under the European Convention on Human Rights article 11 and the EU Race Equality Directive. In this context there is the abovementioned mechanism of 'justified restrictions for the protection of essential requirements in the general interest', that the Court of Justice of the European Union has developed on the basis of the Treaty. Where the Directive does not apply, this mechanism remains decisive. Case law In 2007, the European Court of Justice chose to give two decisions, whose effect appeared to suggest that employers are only required to pay their workers the rate they would receive in their home country, provided this matches minimum wages and working conditions in the country they are posted to. *Laval Un Partneri Ltd v Svenska Byggnadsarbetareforbundet [2008] IRLR 160 (C-319/05, see also (C-319/06), on free movement of services *ITWF v Viking Line ABP [2008] IRLR 143 (C-438/05), on freedom of establishment 2009 Lindsey Oil Refinery strikes The Directive came to prominence during the 2009 Lindsey Oil Refinery strikes after British workers at the Lindsey Oil Refinery in North Killingholme, North Lincolnshire claimed that they were being undercut by skilled foreign labour when the Italian construction contractor IREM appointed several hundred European (mainly Italian and Portuguese) contractors on the site at a time of high unemployment in the local and global economy.Mass walkout over foreign labour ‚Äì BBC NewsHundreds of oil refinery workers walk out over jobs given to foreign workers ‚Äì The Daily TelegraphBrits can kiss jobs goodbye ‚Äì Daily StarBritons walk out in foreign jobs protest ‚Äì Daily Express However, this question is not handled by the Directive. It is a question of the right to free movement for services itself, which is handled directly by the Treaty itself, since the contractor wished to use its own staff rather than hiring external subcontractors. Professor Michelle Eversonhttp://www.bbk.ac.uk/law/our-staff/ft-academic/meverson of Birkbeck, University of London, writing in the Guardian noted at the time, a possible conflict between Article 56 TFEU and Article 45 TFEU in light of decisions of the European Court of Justice. The decisions in question, ruling in relation to the Posting of Workers Directive meant that service providers only have to adhere to the essentials such as minimum pay and health & safety under Article 56, whereas established organisations are required, under Article 45 TFEU, to comply with other matters, such as collective bargaining agreements.

It is caused when there is narrowing of the coronary arteries and a coronary vasodilator is used ‚Äì \\"stealing\\" blood away from those parts of the heart. This happens as a result of the narrowed coronary arteries being always maximally dilated to compensate for the decreased upstream blood supply. Thus, dilating the resistance vessels in the coronary circulation causes blood to be shunted away from the coronary vessels supplying the ischemic zones, creating more ischemia. Cause It is associated with dipyridamole. Hence, dipyridamole is a pharmacological success diagnostically, but a therapeutic failure because of the coronary steal phenomenon.Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 5th Edition Coronary steal is also the mechanism in most drug- based cardiac stress tests; When a patient is incapable of doing physical activity they are given a vasodilator that produces a \\"cardiac steal syndrome\\" as a diagnostic procedure. The test result is positive if the patient's symptoms reappear or if ECG alterations are seen. It is also associated with the administration of Isoflurane, which is an inhaled anesthetic. Hydralazine can potentially cause this condition as well, as it is a direct arteriolar vasodilator. It has been associated with nitroprusside. Other causes Coronary arteriovenous fistula between coronary artery and another cardiac chamber, like, the coronary sinus, right atrium, or right ventricle may cause steal syndrome under conditions like myocardial infarction and possible angina or ventricular arrhythmias, if the shunt is large in magnitude.Harrisson's Principles of Internal Medicine, 17th Edition It can also be associated with new patterns of blood vessel growth.

A development of the unsuccessful Sopwith B.1 bomber, the Grain Griffin was a two-seat single-engined biplane that was built in small numbers for Britain's Royal Naval Air Service, being used operationally during the British intervention in the Russian Civil War. Development and design In late 1916, Sopwith designed and built a prototype of a single-engined single-seat bomber, the Sopwith B.1. It had demonstrated good performance, and had been briefly evaluated by the RNAS in the bomber role over the Western Front in May‚ÄìJune 1917, but was rejected, with larger twin-engined bombers being preferred.Bruce 2001, pp. 1‚Äì6. After its return from France, the prototype B.1 (serial no. N.50), was sent to the RNAS Marine Experimental Depot at Port Victoria on the Isle of Grain for conversion to a two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, to be fitted with folding wings for operation from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers. A cockpit for the observer replaced the bomb-bay of the B.1 behind the pilot's cockpit, while the wings were shortened to allow them to fold. A hydroplane was fitted ahead of the undercarriage and floatation gear added to allow safe ditching at sea. It retained the Hispano-Suiza 8 engine used by the bomber.Bruce 1957, p. 342. When the modified aircraft was tested in November 1917, it was found that the changes had greatly reduced the aircraft's performance, while handling was also poor, with little aileron control.Collyer 1991, p. 54. The design office at Port Victoria had realised prior to the first flight that the proposed changes would not be beneficial to performance, and had commenced design of a modified design, based on the B.1, to solve these problems. These changes included new, longer-span, two-bay wings and a wider fuselage to give room to carry a radio for the observer. The new aircraft was given the name Grain Griffin. N.50 was modified with the new wings and modified controls which greatly improved performance and handling. The first of the true Griffins, serial number N.100, powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Sunbeam Arab engine, started testing in June 1918. A further six Griffins followed, with one powered by the unreliable Arab and the remaining five powered by the 230 hp Bentley BR2 rotary engine.Collyer 1991, p. 55. Operational history A Grain Griffin ditched alongside HMS Vindictive, Baltic Sea, 1919. The Griffins did not see service during the First World War. however, in July 1919, at least three Griffins were deployed on board the aircraft carrier when it sailed to the Baltic Sea in support of the British intervention in the Baltic as part of the Russian Civil War. The Griffin was replaced in service by the Parnall Panther, which was chosen to equip the Royal Air Force's Fleet Spotter squadrons.

The action involved workers at around a dozen energy sites across the UK who walked out in support of other British workers at the Total's Lindsey Oil Refinery. The Lindsey Oil Refinery construction workers went on strike because employment was not offered to them on a ¬£200 million construction contract to build a hydro desulphurisation unit at the site.Unite's statement on the Lindsey Oil Refinery dispute January 2009 action On 28 January 2009, approximately 800 of Lindsey Oil Refinery's local contractors went on strike following the appointment by the Italian construction contractor IREM of several hundred European (mainly Italian and Portuguese) contractors on the site at a time of high unemployment in the local and global economy. The action attracted considerable media interest. Workers contended that the strike was in defence of a national agreement determining wages and conditions in the industry. The protests were largely portrayed in the British media as being solely about the use of the European Union's Posted Workers Directive to discriminate against British workers, prompting Unite the union to make a statement on 4 February to refute xenophobic comments in the media. Since European Union law enshrines the right to the freedom of movement for workers between EU member states, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: \\"When I talked about British jobs, I was talking about giving people in Britain the skills, so that they have the ability to get jobs which were at present going to people from abroad, and actually encouraging people to take up the courses and the education and learning that is necessary for British workers to be far more skilled for the future.\\" Asked for his message to people considering the wildcat strikes, he said: \\"That that's not the right thing to do and it's not defensible.\\" Italian and Portuguese construction workers, living on barges in nearby docks, were set to starting work there. British trade unions claimed Britons were not given any opportunity to apply for the posts.British PM slams strikers in EU workers row, Agence France Press (31 January 2009) Additional contractors at other sites in the United Kingdom also initiated action as a result of the protests. On 30 January, around 700 workers at the Grangemouth Oil Refinery in central Scotland walked out in solidarity with the North Lincolnshire strikers. They were also joined by 50 strikers in Aberthaw, in South Wales, 400 at the ICI site in Wilton, Teesside. and walkouts also took place at British Petroleum in Saltend, Hull. Following several days of talks between representatives from Total and the GMB union which were chaired by Acas, a deal was finally struck on 5 February and workers at the refinery agreed to return to work the following Monday. The deal would see 102 new jobs being created for British workers in addition to the posts awarded to an IREM. An earlier deal that would have seen the creation of 60 British jobs (40 skilled and 20 unskilled) had been rejected. On 16 February an Acas report concluded that Total had not broken the law in employing Italian workers at the refinery. The strike at Lindsey resumed on 11 June 2009, after a subcontractor at the site laid off a number of employees, later confirmed to be 51. The strike was quickly followed by sympathy strikes at Cheshire's Fiddlers Ferry Power Station on 15 June and Aberthaw on 17 June. The strikes escalated on 18 June, with walkouts at Drax Power Station and Eggborough Power Station in Yorkshire and Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station in Nottinghamshire, BP Saltend, and the BOC oxygen plant at Scunthorpe. June 2009 action On 19 June 2009 nearly 700 construction staff were sacked at the Lindsey Oil Refinery. The sackings came following 1,200 workers walking out unofficially at the plant in a jobs dispute. The following plants walked out in sympathy: * Stanlow oil refinery, Ellesmere Port, Cheshire * Aberthaw, Cardiff * Ferrybridge power station, West Yorkshire * Staythorpe Power Station, Nottinghamshire * Ensus site, Wilton chemical complex, Teesside * Drax and Eggborough power stations, near Selby, North Yorkshire * Fiddler's Ferry power station in Cheshire Paul Kenny, General Secretary of the GMB trade union, said: \\"GMB condemn the action of Total. Total have for a full week refused to meet the union to resolve the problems through ACAS. It seems pretty obvious that there is a mass case of victimisation taking place here. Locking out the workforce at Lindsay will not solve the problem. It will escalate it.\\" Workers at the Lindsey refinery were invited to re-apply for their jobs, with managers at Total giving them a deadline of 17:00 on Monday 22 June 2009 to do so. However, angered by the actions of the management, workers burned their dismissal letters at a protest outside the refinery. Around 3,000 workers at other sites around the country also walked out in support of the Lindsey workers. Negotiations between Total and representatives of the GMB union were adjourned on Tuesday 23 June with some progress having been made, but sources said a number of \\"significant barriers\\" remained outstanding before the dispute could be resolved. Talks resumed on 25 June, and an agreement was reached late that evening to end the industrial action, accepted at a mass meeting outside the refinery on the following Monday. The deal included the reinstatement of the 647 workers at the Lindsey site who had been sacked for taking unofficial action, offers of alternative jobs for the 51 workers laid off, and assurances that workers at power stations and oil and gas terminals who walked out in sympathy would not be victimised. On 29 June workers at the refinery voted to accept the deal.

He played college football as a guard for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1911 to 1913. He was also selected to Walter Camp's All-Service team while serving in the military during World War I. Early years Allmendinger was born Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1890. He was the son of Henry and Wilhelmina \\"Minnie\\" Kraus Allmendinger. He grew up in the days of Fielding H. Yost's \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams and played football with John Maulbetsch at Ann Arbor's West Park. He then played right guard and right tackle at Ann Arbor High School from 1907 to 1909 for teams that lost one game in three seasons. He acquired the nickname \\"Aqua\\" after working as a waterboy when the Ann Arbor Railroad was raising tracks in 1903 on the streets of Ann Arbor. University of Michigan Allmendinger played the guard position at the University of Michigan from 1911 to 1913. In November 1913, Allmendinger helped Michigan to a 17-0 win over Cornell, leading The Washington Post to report: \\"Allmendinger played a brilliant game on the defense. Three hundred Michigan rooters, headed by their brass band, paraded and snake-danced after the game.\\" At the end of the 1913 season, Allmendinger was picked as an All- Western guard on nearly all of the All-Western teams, including the team selected by Walter Eckersall. A newspaper account in the summer of 1917 described Allmendinger's progression as follows: > \\"Allmendinger, a young giant in perfect physical condition tried > unsuccessfully for two years to make the varsity eleven. His quiet > temperament was the handicap and during these years Coach Yost declared that > if Allmendinger 'could get good and mad once, he would be one of the > greatest linemen in the game.'

Coaching career Following his playing career, he was the head coach at the South Dakota School of Mines in 1914. He compiled a 4-1 record during his sole season at South Dakota Mines. In 1915, he returned to Michigan as an assistant coach. He was also an assistant at the Colorado School of Mines. World War I and Walter Camp's All-Service team In July 1917, as the United States entered World War I, Allmendinger enrolled in the U.S. Army, I Company, 31st Michigan Infantry, becoming \\"another University of Michigan athlete to answer his country's call.\\" Allmendinger was one of several prominent football players commissioned at Fort Sheridan in the fall of 1917; others included former Michigan All-Americans Albert Benbrook and James B. Craig. On Thanksgiving Day 1917, with the country's top players in the military, an All- Star game between the country's top Army and Navy players was held at Stagg Field in Chicago. Almmendinger was the starting right tackle on the Army team. Because of the war, Walter Camp did not select an All-America team in 1917. Instead, Camp named an All-America service team in 1917, recognizing the country's top football players serving in the military. Allmendinger was named to Camp's 1917 All-Service team. Allmendinger rose to the rank of captain before being discharged in 1919. He also worked as an assistant football coach at Michigan during the 1919 season.

German authorities estimate that there are 4,000 active Scientologists in Germany ;Bayerisches Staatsministerium des Innern (2012) the Church of Scientology gives a membership figure of around 12,000.Scientology- Fakten The Church of Scientology has encountered particular antagonism from the German press and government and occupies a precarious legal, social and cultural position in Germany. , German courts have so far not resolved whether to accord Scientology the legal status of a religious or worldview community, and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions. The German domestic intelligence service is constantly monitoring the organization and mention them in their annual review about anti-constitutional activities. The German government does not recognize Scientology as a religion; rather, it views it as an abusive business masquerading as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the German constitution. This stance has been criticized by the U.S. government.Barber (1997-01-30) Scientologists in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions. They are barred from membership in some major political parties, and businesses and other employers use so-called \\"sect filters\\" to expose a prospective business partner's or employee's association with the organization. German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007, but abandoned the initiative a year later, finding insufficient legal grounds. As of 2017, polls suggest that half of Germans supported banning Scientology, while over two- thirds considered Scientology dangerous. Background Scientology, founded in the early 1950s in the United States by L. Ron Hubbard and today claiming to be represented in 150 countries, has been a very controversial new religious movement.Richardson (2009), p. 283 Its stated utopian aim is to \\"clear the planet\\", to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations.Palmer (2009), p. 316 Scientology teaches that the source of people's unhappiness lies in \\"engrams\\", psychological burdens acquired in the course of painful experiences, which can be cleared through a type of counselling called \\"auditing\\" made available by the Church of Scientology. The fact that Scientologists have to pay large fees for auditing and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history, with governments classing it as a profit-making enterprise rather than as a religion.Melton (2000), pp. 53‚Äì64 Critics maintain that Scientology is \\"a business-driven, psychologically manipulative, totalitarian ideology with world-dominating aspirations\\",Beit- Hallahmi (2003), p. 31 and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for Scientology courses. Scientology has fought innumerable lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion. These efforts have been partly successful ‚Äì Scientology has gained recognition as a tax-exempt religious group in a number of countries, most notably in Australia in 1983 and the United States in 1993, and in 2007 won an important case at the European Court of Human Rights, which censured Russia for failing to register Scientology as a religion.Richardson (2009), pp. 286‚Äì288 The German government has said that it does not consider Scientology a religion, but a \\"commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism\\" whose \\"totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany's democratic society\\". Accordingly, the German government has taken a very strong stance against the organization. Germany is not alone in opposing Scientology; in France, the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud in October 2009, after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for Scientology products, and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether.Lauter (2009-10-28) Scientology is similarly controversial in Belgium, Greece and the UK.German Embassy, Washington (2001) On the subject of Scientology's status as a religion, the German government has pointed to a 1995 decision by the Federal Labor Court of Germany. That court, noting Hubbard's instruction that Scientologists should \\"make money, make more money ‚Äì make other people produce so as to make more money\\", came to the conclusion that \\"Scientology purports to be a 'church' merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests\\". In the same decision, the court also found that Scientology uses \\"inhuman and totalitarian practices\\". Given the lessons of Germany's 20th-century history, in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings, Germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power.Richardson (2009), p. 289 References in Scientology writings to the elimination of \\"parasites\\" and \\"antisocial\\" people who stand in the way of progress towards Scientology's utopian world \\"without insanity, without criminals and without war\\" evoke uncomfortable parallels with Nazism, and have led to Scientology being classified as an \\"extremist political movement\\".Luca (2004), p. 58 To further justify its stance, the German government has also pointed to the long history of U.S. court cases involving Scientology, including the conviction of 11 top Scientologists in 1979 and 1980 for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of U.S. government agencies, wiretapping and the theft of government documents, a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court finding that Scientology practices took place in a \\"coercive environment\\", and Scientology's track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators. In examining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German government has noted that Scientology organizations are \\"structured so as to make the individual psychologically and financially dependent on a Scientology system\\", and that members often abandon contact with friends and family. History=Scientology's presence in Germany The Scientology Church in Hamburg Scientology first became active in Germany in 1970.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (2007-12-07) By 2007, there were ten major centres (\\"Scientology Churches\\"), as well as fourteen minor centres (\\"Scientology Missions\\") in Germany. The German Scientology Churches are located in the big cities ‚Äì Munich, Hamburg, Berlin, D√ºsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, Hannover and Stuttgart. Of the Scientology Missions, nine are in Baden- W√ºrttemberg, and three in Bavaria.Berliner Morgenpost (2007-01-15) Following German re-unification, Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic; most adherents are found in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Bavaria and North Rhine- Westphalia.Willms (2005), p. 331 Scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or Vereine in Germany; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V.Fifka & Sykora (2009), pp. 89 Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000.Berliner Morgenpost (2007-06-24)Deutsche Welle (2008-11-21) The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years.Willms (2005), p. 92 However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement.Willms (2005), p. 90 The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred.Willms (2005), pp. 92‚Äì93 Scientology formulated a \\"Clear Germany\\" strategy in 1994 ‚Äì similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world ‚Äì with the long-term aim of transforming German society in line with the Scientological ideal: a non-pluralist society in which Scientology enjoys overriding influence.Fifka & Sykora (2009), pp. 65‚Äì67Scherff (2008), pp. 13‚Äì14 The programme sought to address Scientology's image problems in Germany, to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain, such as Germany's National Socialist history, and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society, with a special emphasis on manoeuvring Scientologists into key positions in industry and government. As most religions seek to widen their influence in society, such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort, much like those many religions engage in. However, according to the BfV, the strategy has not had any significant success. By 1998, 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed, but apart from some isolated cases, most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology. According to Fifka & Sydora (2009), it is unknown to what degree the \\"Clear Germany\\" programme is still being pursued. Public opposition German public discourse does not regard Scientology as a religion, but generally characterizes it as a Sekte (cult or sect), or as an exploitative profit-making venture preying on vulnerable minds. Public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early 1970s, when widespread debate took place about \\"youth religions\\" such as the Unification Church, ISKCON, Children of God, and the Divine Light Mission.Seiwert (2004), pp. 85‚Äì94 The most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the \\"sect commissioners\\" (Sektenbeauftragte) of Germany's Protestant Churches, who also actively promoted the establishment of private \\"initiatives of parents and concerned persons\\". Aktion Bildungsinformation (\\"Educational Information Campaign\\") became an important organization dedicated to opposing Scientology; taking an activist stance, it warned people not to get involved with Scientology, filed successful lawsuits against the Church of Scientology over its proselytizing in public places, and published an influential book, The Sect of Scientology and its Front Organizations.Melton (2000), pp. 61‚Äì62 In 1981, the organization's founder, Ingo Heinemann, became the director of Aktion f√ºr geistige und psychische Freiheit (\\"Campaign for Intellectual and Psychic Freedom\\"), Germany's most prominent anti-cult organization. Warnings from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation; as the movements were not doing anything illegal, the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious sects, the earliest of these publications appearing in 1979. Fueled by events such as the Waco Siege in 1993, the murders and suicides associated with the Order of the Solar Temple, and the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo incidents in Japan, German fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s, with Scientology attracting particular attention.Willms (2005), p. 284Browne (1998), p. 201 Perceptions that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert Vaughn Young, an American ex-Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology, visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der Spiegel, a widely read weekly magazine, describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a gulag ‚Äì the Rehabilitation Project Force ‚Äì for members of Scientology's Sea Org found guilty of transgressions.Kent (1999) From the mid-1990s onward, press articles, reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis, accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience.Willms (2005), p. 12 Information leaflets on Islamic extremism, Scientology and organized crime, published by the Bavarian Office for the Protection of the ConstitutionBavarian State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (2009) As noted by the religious scholar Hubert Seiwert, Scientology came to be seen as a \\"serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will-less zombies, but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state\\". This view of Scientology as a public enemy, Seiwert adds, \\"became a matter of political correctness\\": senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology, and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social ostracism. Stephen A. Kent, writing in 1998, noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed. Scientology was viewed as \\"a totalitarian, business-driven organization [...] guilty of significant human rights abuses.\\"Kent (2002) Officials examining primary and secondary sources, legal documents, and the testimony of former members, concluded that the organization was \\"antithetical to a democratic state\\". Federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology.Boyle & Sheen (1997), p. 312‚Äì313 Government publications on the dangers of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, in large part because of public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services. An area of widespread concern in the German media has been the alleged \\"infiltration\\" of businesses by Scientologists, in line with Scientology's declared aim to penetrate society, politics and business in preparation for world domination.Brendel (2009-04-03) Attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium-size companies, such as estate agents, management consultants and management- training companies. Management-consultancy firms led by Scientologists often conceal their association with Scientology; once they have recruited members of their clients' upper management, these managers may send employees to Scientology trainers, as part of company education and training programmes, without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used.Fleischhauer (1991-04-01) An expensive commercial version of Scientology's Oxford Capacity Analysis, usually offered free as part of Scientology proselytizing in public places, temporarily entered some major German companies (who were unaware of its provenance) via such a management- consultancy firm. In the mid-2000s, German sect experts expressed concerns that Scientologists were becoming active in the German after-school tutoring market.Kleinhubbert (2006-06-22) These concerns arose because customers of around 20 after-school tutoring centres operated by Scientologists in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by Scientologists, using Scientology methods. Brochures advertising the tutoring services would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, but not Scientology itself. In early 2008, Thomas Gandow, Sect Commissioner of the German Lutheran Church in Berlin and Brandenburg,Moore (2008-01-13) and the historian Guido Knopp both likened the Scientologist Hollywood actor Tom Cruise to Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister.Smee (2008-01-21) Gandow and Knopp cited a leaked Scientology video in which Cruise was seen asking the audience whether Scientologists should \\"clean up\\" the world, the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers ‚Äì cheers which Gandow and Knopp felt were reminiscent of the audience's response to Goebbels' famous question, \\"Do you want total war?\\" Gandow's and Knopp's comments found few critics in Germany. Most Germans consider Scientology a subversive organization. In 1997, Time reported that 70% of Germans favoured banning Scientology; a poll conducted in September 2008 by Der Spiegel found 67% support for a ban.Fr√∂hlingsdorf & Stark (2008-09-22) German scholars such as Brigitte Sch√∂n and Gerald Willms have commented that rhetoric dominates public discourse around Scientology in Germany: in their view, efforts to \\"frame\\" information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying realities.Willms (2005), pp. 11‚Äì14, 259‚Äì260 In Sch√∂n's words, this includes both the \\"efforts of German politicians to enhance their popularity with strong-worded statements\\" and \\"Scientology's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution\\"; commenting on foreign reporting on Scientology in Germany, she adds that \\"the American press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to American stereotypes\\". Both Willms and Sch√∂n assert that the situation is compounded by the general paucity of scientific studies of Scientology. Sch√∂n as well as Irving Hexham, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary in Canada, have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars. Hexham attributes this situation to the strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany, which has made German academics wary of approaching the subject, because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate.Hexham (1998) In 2010, a German public broadcaster, ARD, showed the film Until Nothing Remains, a dramatized account of the effect Scientology had on one German family.Abendzeitung (2010-04-02) U.S. Department of State (2010-11-17) Said to be based on a true story, the film attracted widespread media attention and a viewership of 8.69 million. Legal status While there have been calls for Scientology to be banned, the Church of Scientology remains legal in Germany and is allowed to operate there.Cieply & Landler (2007-06-30) Its precise legal status however is unresolved.Menzenbach & Hippe (2007), pp. 1‚Äì2 Two points are contested: first, whether or not the teachings of Scientology qualify as a \\"religion or worldview\\" (Religion or Weltanschauung; these are equal before German lawWeber (1999), p. 175), and secondly, whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity; if the latter were the case, this would most likely imply that Scientology would not qualify for protection as a \\"religious or worldview community\\" (Religions- oder Weltanschauungsgemeinschaft) under Article 4 of the German constitution, which guarantees the freedom of belief, religion and worldview. Status as a \\"religious or worldview community\\" also affects a broad range of other issues in Germany, such as taxation and freedom of association. The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter, but implicitly assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or worldview community. The Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that Scientology should be viewed as a worldview community. In 1995, the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or worldview community entitled to protection under Article 4 of the German Constitution, although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003. In another 2003 decision, the Administrative Court of Baden-W√ºrttemberg in Mannheim said there were no indications that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity.Cologne Archdiocese (2003-12-12)Baden-W√ºrttemberg Administrative Court (2003-12-12) In 2005, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4.1 of the German Constitution, which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate.Zacharias (2006)Federal Administrative Court of Germany (2005-12-15) Many courts have declined to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion. Recent years have seen a number of court decisions in Scientology's favour, despite the very widespread negative attitude to Scientology among politicians and the general public. Government surveillance The logo of the Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz (BfV) Given the history of Nazism's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s, the present German state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution.Walker (1996-11-18)Kent (2008-04-16) The BfV domestic intelligence service (Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany's free and democratic order, and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997, as have the Offices for the Protection of the Constitution in a number of German L√§nder.Hering (2004-11-11) Minister for Family Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance, saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal.Hendon & Kennedy (1996), p. 445 The German Church of Scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court. In December 2001, the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the Church of Scientology Berlin as paid informants. The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate.Berliner Zeitung (2001-12-14)CESNUR: Berlin Administrative Court press statement (2001-12-13) In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution.Besier & Neumann (2004), p. 213Berliner Morgenpost (2003-12-05) At the federal level, Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution.Der Spiegel (2005-04-27) Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights. In Saarland, surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in 2005, because there is no local branch of Scientology and few members. As of 6 May 2008, the Church of Scientology in Germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the BfV after the North Rhine-Westphalia Higher Administrative Court in M√ºnster refused to hear an appeal on the matter. Being suspected of maintaining \\"ambitions against the free, democratic basic order\\", the Scientology organization added a declaration on human rights and democracy to its bylaws.Eddy (2008-05-06) There is at least one example of surveillance of Scientology by the German intelligence services outside of Germany. In 1998, the Swiss government detained an agent of the German government, charging him with \\"carrying out illegal business for a foreign state, working for a political information service and falsifying identity documents\\".BBC News (1998-04-09)BBC News (1998-06-23) The German government posted bail for the agent.Hendon & Allman (1998), p. 714 He was eventually given a 30-day suspended jail sentence for spying on Scientology, and the German government apologized to Switzerland for the incident.Associated Press (1999-12-01) Sect filters Ursula Caberta speaking in 2008 at a Hamburg conference on Scientology A \\"sect filter\\", also known as a \\"protective declaration\\" (Schutzerkl√§rung), is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract.Shupe & Darnell (2006), p. 231 Such sect filters, primarily used to screen out Scientologists, have been drafted by German government agencies for use by businesses. \\"Sect commissioner\\" offices exist in Germany as part of regional or local government. A work instruction introduced in 1996 requires government staff in the Arbeits√§mter ‚Äì local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs ‚Äì to mark companies owned by Scientologists with the letter \\"S\\".Davis (1999), p. 453 Where companies are suspected of having Scientologist staff, prospective employees are alerted to this fact by government staff. Government officials have publicised the names of individual Scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses; some businesspeople have placed advertisements in the press saying they are not Scientologists in order to avoid the associated stigma. Due to concerns about possible government infiltration by Scientologists, applicants for civil service positions in Bavaria are required to declare whether or not they are Scientologists, and a similar policy has been instituted in Hesse.Cohen (1996-11-15) Companies tendering for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not Scientologists; in 2001, this requirement was changed, and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that \\"the technology of L. Ron Hubbard will not be used in executing the contract\\".Fox (2008), pp. 129‚Äì130 When it became known that Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system included a disk defragmenter developed by Executive Software International (a company headed by a Scientologist), this caused concern among German government officials and clergy over data security and the potential for espionage. To assuage these concerns, Microsoft Germany agreed to provide a means to disable the utility.Haddadin (2000-11-06) Following letters of complaint about discrimination from Scientology lawyers, some American companies such as General Electric, IBM and Ford Motor Company instructed their German subsidiaries to cease the use of protective declarations.Nordhausen & Billerbeck (2008), pp. 469‚Äì470 The city-state of Hamburg set up a full-time office dedicated to opposing Scientology, the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority, under the leadership of Ursula Caberta.Melton (2000), p. 62 In 2005, in a case brought by a Scientologist, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany ordered the city of Hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community, finding that the practice infringed religious freedom. In June 2008, the Hamburg Administrative Court fined the city of Hamburg 5,000 Euros ($7,000) for not complying with court instructions banning the use of \\"sect filters.\\"U.S. Department of State (2009-02-25) Internet links to sample filters to be used by businesses had continued to remain available. Eileen Barker, a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics, has noted that \\"Germany has gone further than any other Western European country in restricting the civil rights of Scientologists.\\" The Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts; Caberta moved to a position within the Hamburg interior authority, where she continues her work on Scientology.NeuesDeutschland (2010-08-19)Ad Hoc News (2010-10-20) Scientologists have been banned from joining major political parties in Germany such as the Christian Democratic Union, the Christian Social Union of Bavaria, the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Free Democratic Party.Frantz (1997-11-08)Der Spiegel (2006-09-15) Existing Scientologist members of these parties have been \\"purged\\", according to Time magazine. Scientologists have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies in Germany; Scientologists who were running such agencies had their permits revoked. In 1995, a sports scientist and former member of the German national fencing team was dismissed from his job at the German Olympic fencing centre after he stated in an interview that he had enjoyed reading books by L. Ron Hubbard and had participated in a course run by a Scientologist management and communication consultancy firm.Focus (1995-10-22) Thomas Gottschalk, a German TV presenter, was falsely accused in 1993 of having taken part in Scientology courses; Gottschalk responded by announcing that he had not, and that he would henceforth cease all contact with a friend who had links to Scientology.Focus (1993-07-19) In 2007, G√ºnther Oettinger, the Minister- President of the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, expressed concern that Scientologist John Travolta was to appear on Gottschalk's programme, and asked the ZDF TV station to consider revoking the invitation; the ZDF said that uninviting Travolta would cause greater damage, and that Scientology was not going to be discussed in the programme.Spiegel (2007-03-27) In 2010, the Bavarian Administrative Court ruled that a woman working in a children's daycare centre, whose employment had been terminated when her ex-husband identified her as a Scientologist, should be reinstated.Abendzeitung (2010-05-19) The woman had demonstrated to the court's satisfaction that her Scientological beliefs were irrelevant to her work. According to the agreement that concluded the case, she promised not to use Scientology methods in her work, and to inform the children's parents of her membership in Scientology. According to Erin Prophet in Handbook of Scientology some German companies have specifically asked applicants if they are Scientologist, and denied employment to those who are affiliated with the Church. Prophet says that similar claims have been made against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Catholic Church. Initiative to ban Scientology The opening of the Berlin Scientology headquarters was attended by Scientologists from around the world, including celebrities Anne Archer and Chick Corea.Life (2007-01-13) In March 2007, it was reported that German authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor Scientology in response to the opening of a new Scientology headquarters in Berlin.Stark & Rosenbach (2007-03-27) On December 7, 2007, German federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the Scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti- constitutional goals, restricting \\"essential basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment\\", and asked Germany's domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information required for a possible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the organization.German interior ministers' conference resolutions (2007-12-07) The move was criticized by German politicians from all sides of the political spectrum, with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail in the courts.Tagesspiegel (2007-12-08)Solms-Laubach (2007-12-07)Der Spiegel (2007-12-10) Sabine Weber, president of the Church of Scientology in Berlin, called the accusations \\"unrealistic\\" and \\"absurd\\" and said that the German interior ministers' evaluation was based on \\"a few sentences out of 500,000 pages of Scientological literature\\". She added, \\"I can also find hundreds of quotes in the Bible that are totalitarian but that doesn't mean I will demand the ban of Christianity.\\"Grieshaber (2007-12-09) Poster warning of the dangers of Scientology in front of the Berlin headquarters; the courts later ordered the poster's removal. In November 2008, the government abandoned its attempts to ban Scientology, after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity.CBC News / AP (2008-11-21) The report by the BfV cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful. First, the BfV report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization; there were German churches and missions, a German board, German bylaws, and no evidence that the organization was \\"totally remote-controlled\\" from the United States. A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one.Netzeitung / AP (2007-12-03) The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology's aggressive opposition to the constitution. Here, the report found that Scientology's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow Germany's free and democratic basic order. \\"Neither its bylaws nor any other utterances\\" supported the \\"conclusion that the organization had criminal aims\\". The BfV also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence, but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning. Commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt, Ehrhart K√∂rting, Berlin's interior minister, said, \\"This organization pursues goals ‚Äì through its writings, its concept and its disrespect for minorities ‚Äì that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution. But they put very little of this into practice. The appraisal of the Government at the moment is that [Scientology] is a lousy organization, but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to.\\"Fischer (2008-11-23) The Church of Scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision, describing it as the \\"only one possible\\". Monitoring of Scientology's activities by the German intelligence services continues. In February 2009, the Berlin Administrative Court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the Berlin Scientology headquarters, warning passers-by of the potential dangers Scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom, should be removed.Tagesspiegel (2009-07-14)Berlin Senate's Justice Department (2009-03-02) The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg, which ruled that the poster violated Scientologists' basic religious rights.Berlin Senate's Justice Department (2009-07-13) Criticism of Germany's stance Tom Cruise is one of several Scientologist artists who have been subject to boycott calls in Germany.Die Zeit (2007-07-09)The United States media, while generally reporting negatively on Scientology in domestic news, has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards Scientology in relation to Germany.Sch√∂n (2001), pp. 1, 6, 18 Richard Cohen for example, writing in The Washington Post, said in 1996: \\"Scientology might be one weird religion, but the German reaction to it is weirder still ‚Äì not to mention disturbing.\\" Alan Cowell, writing in the New York Times, wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology ‚Äì motivated by officials' fear that Scientology \\"was a totalitarian movement growing, like the Nazi party, from inconsequential beginnings\\" ‚Äì was itself redolent of \\"the Nazi era's authoritarianism\\".Cowell (1997-11-23) The U.S. Department of State has repeatedly claimed that Germany's actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists' individual rights posed by sect filters.Lehmann (2004), pp. 68‚Äì71Washington Post (1997-02-01)Frantz (1997-03-09) The U.S. Department of State began to include the issue of Scientology in Germany in its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the Church of Scientology and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, through which Scientology gained the status of a tax-exempt religion in the United States. That decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the Church of Scientology in Washington, using paid lobbyists. The State Department's 1996 human rights report on Germany, released in January 1997, warned that artists and businesses with Scientology connections \\"may face boycotts and discrimination, sometimes with government approval.\\"Tank (1997-01-30) Past targets of such actions had included Scientologist actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta, as well as jazz pianist Chick Corea. Also in January 1997, an open letter to then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared, published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune, drawing parallels between the \\"organized oppression\\" of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies espoused by Germany in the 1930s. The letter was conceived and paid for by Hollywood lawyer Bertram Fields, whose clients have included Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the U.S. entertainment industry, including the top executives of MGM, Warner Bros., Paramount, Universal and Sony Pictures Entertainment as well as actors Dustin Hoffman and Goldie Hawn, director Oliver Stone, writers Mario Puzo and Gore Vidal and talk-show host Larry King.Bonfante & van Voorst (1997-02-10)Masters (1997-02-10)Drozdiak (1997-01-14) It echoed similar parallels drawn by the Church of Scientology itself, which until then had received scant notice, and was followed by lobbying efforts of Scientology celebrities in Washington.Dahl (1998-03-29) U.S. Department of State spokesman Nicholas Burns rejected the Nazi comparisons in the open letter as \\"outrageous\\" and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology, saying, \\"We have criticized the Germans on this, but we aren't going to support the Scientologists' terror tactics against the German government.\\" Chancellor Kohl, commenting on the letter, said that those who signed it \\"don't know a thing about Germany and don't want to know.\\" German officials argued that \\"the whole fuss was cranked up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won't give them: tax-exempt status as a religion. This is intimidation, pure and simple.\\" Officials explained that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all \\"radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups\\", and not just against Scientology. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as \\"absurd\\" and cited German court rulings stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a \\"contemptuous cartel of oppression\\".Schmid (1997-01-15) In February 1997, a United States immigration court judge granted asylum to a German Scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland. In April 1997, John Travolta met personally with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a conference in Philadelphia.Cockburn (1998-04-10) Travolta later said Clinton assured him that he would \\"really love to help\\" with the \\"issue over in Germany with Scientology\\". According to Travolta, Clinton recalled that \\"he had a roommate years ago who was a Scientologist and had really liked him, and respected his views on it\\", stating that Scientologists \\"were given an unfair hand in [Germany] and that he wanted to fix it\\". In September 1997, John Travolta, Chick Corea and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE, also known as the Helsinki Commission), voicing their complaints about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany, and had a briefing with United States National Security Advisor Sandy Berger, whom Clinton had assigned to be \\"the administration's Scientology point person\\". The German ambassador responded with a letter to the CSCE stating that the German government had come to the conclusion that Scientology's \\"pseudo-scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals' mental and physical health and that it exploits its members\\", adding that \\"membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency, to financial ruin, and even to suicide. In addition, there are indications that Scientology poses a threat to Germany's basic political principles.\\" A United Nations report in April 1998 raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect filters. However, it rejected the comparison of the treatment of Scientologists with that of Jews during the Nazi era.U.S. Department of State (1999) In 2000, the German Stern magazine published the results of its investigation of the asylum case. It asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her asylum application ‚Äì ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist ‚Äì had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs, and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax evasion at the time she applied for asylum.Kent (2001), pp. 3, 12‚Äì13  On a 2000 visit to Clearwater, Florida, Ursula Caberta of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the asylum case had been part of an \\"orchestrated effort\\" by Scientology undertaken \\"for political gain\\", and \\"a spectacular abuse of the U.S. system\\".Tobin (2000-07-26) German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater, in turn, accused Caberta of stoking a \\"hate campaign\\" in Germany that had \\"ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists\\" and maintained that Scientologists had not \\"exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States.\\" Mark Rathbun, a (former) top Church of Scientology official, said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case, \\"there would have been nothing improper if it had.\\" In 2003, Joachim G√ºntner, writing in the Swiss Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, noted that Gerhard Besier, a German Christian theologian, director of the Hannah Arendt Institute for Research into Totalitarianism in Dresden and recipient of an honorary doctorate from Lund University, Sweden, for his championing of religious freedom, had been pressured to forego publication of his scientific study of Scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the German media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards Scientology.G√ºntner (2004-06-30)taz (2009-06-16) G√ºntner concluded that \\"alarmism\\" had \\"triumphed\\" over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in Germany's ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter.G√ºntner (2003-11-24) The U.S. Department of State's 2012 report on religious freedom in Germany, published in 2013, stated that \\"The status of the Church of Scientology remains in limbo. The Constitutional Court and various courts at the state level have not explicitly ruled that Scientology is a religion. Government agencies at the federal and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against Scientology as a group and against its members. Four of the major political parties (the Christian Democratic Union, Christian Social Union, Social Democratic Party, and Free Democratic Party) ban Scientologists from party membership. [...] Scientologists reported instances of governmental discrimination. Although courts at the state and federal level condemned the improper use of so-called 'sect filters' to blacklist and boycott Scientologists, they remained in use in the public sector. 'Sect filters' typically asked potential new employees to confirm in writing that they had no contact with Scientology, did not participate in its training courses, and rejected its doctrines. [...] Catholic and Protestant churches continued to oppose Scientology , although press reporting and public reactions to Scientology decreased. Several private organizations issued warnings about after-school study programs run by Scientologists.\\"U.S. Department of State (2014) See also *Scientology status by country NotesReferences=Scholarly sources       Journalistic sources                Government and court documents     Scientology sources  * External links=Scientology sites * Scientology.de * Menschenrechtsbuero.de ‚Äì Human Rights website of the German Church of Scientology German government sites * Scientology: Publications of German regional governments ‚Äì Website of the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution * Website of the Hamburg Scientology Task Force Germany Religious organisations based in Germany ","title":"Scientology in Germany"},{"id":"21353932","title":"Jason Garrison"},{"id":"21353944","text":"David Adjmi (born 1973) is an American playwright. He is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Whiting Award, the inaugural Steinberg Playwright Award, a Bush Artists Fellowship, and the Kesselring Prize for Drama. Life Adjmi grew up in a Syrian Jewish family in Midwood, BrooklynNew York Times: \\"Once a Boyhood Outsider, Now Reflecting on His Tribe\\" By FELICIA R. LEE June 16, 2009 He is a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College (1995), the Playwrights Workshop at the University of Iowa (MFA 2001), and the Juilliard School's American Playwrights Program (2003). As of 2010, he resides in Brooklyn Heights. Career Adjmi's play The Evildoers was developed at the Sundance Institute and the Royal Court Theatre in London. It premiered in January 2008 at the Yale Repertory Theatre. Variety called it \\"an anxiety attack of a play\\" and, of Adjmi, noted that he is \\"clearly a writer with a distinct voice, ambition and style.\\" His play Stunning opened a month later at Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in Washington DC where it was selected as one of the top ten plays of the year by The Washington Post and was published in American Theatre magazine. Stunning premiered in New York at Lincoln Center Theater in June 2009 where it played an extended run to sold-out houses. Adjmi's play Marie Antoinette was developed at the Goodman Theatre's New Stages Series and the Sundance Institute's Residency at the Public Theatre. It will premiere in a coproduction between the American Repertory Theater and Yale Repertory Theatre in Fall 2012. His play \\"3C\\" premieres at Rattlestick Playwrights Theatre in June 2012. His monologue Elective Affinities was commissioned by the Royal Court Theatre and later premiered at the Royal Shakespeare Company in the United Kingdom. In November, 2011 it received its U.S. Premiere at Soho Repertory Theatre, featuring Tony Award-winning actress Zoe Caldwell, and directed by OBIE winner Sarah Benson. His play Marie Antoinette, which was presented at Yale Rep. in 2012 and received three Connecticut Critics Circle Awards including Best Play, opened the 2013‚Äì2014 season at Soho Rep. under the direction of Rebecca Taichman and with many members of the original cast. The New Yorker recently named Adjmi at one of the Top Ten in Culture for 2011, and described him as an artist who is part of \\"a new trend in the American theatre.\\" Other plays include Strange Attractors, Caligula and the controversial hit 3C which put Adjmi in the center of a media firestorm and a legal battle with DLT Entertainment, the rights holders of the television series \\"Three's Company\\" which Adjmi satirized in his play. DLT issued a Cease and Desist to the playwright on Adjmi's opening night. In 2014, Adjmi sued for a declaratory judgment that he had not infringed DLT's copyright. On March 31, 2015, three years after its premiere, United States District Judge Loretta Preska ruled in a 56-page decision that the play deconstructed rather than repeated the sitcom, turning it into ‚Äúa nightmarish version of itself‚Äù and was protected as a fair use. 3C made Year's Best lists in Time Out New York, the New York Post and The Advocate. Adjmi is the recipient of numerous awards for his work, including the Helen Merrill Award, the Marian Seldes-Garson Kanin Fellowship, and McKnight and Jerome Fellowships from The Playwrights' Center. A collection of his work, Stunning and Other Plays, was published by Theatre Communications Group in 2011, and a second collection, 1789/1978, was published in October 2017. Adjmi is currently at work on The Stumble, a commission for Lincoln Center Theatre, and Stereophonic, a co-commission for Second Stage Theatre and Center Theater Group. His memoir entitled Lot Six will be published in June 2020 by HarperCollins.

She gained participation by women leaders from all 30 states of the Union at that time. The Association raised all the capital needed to complete its purchase of Mount Vernon by 1859 and took possession on February 22, Washington's birthday. The Association continues to own and operate, Mount Vernon, George Washington's home and plantation. Biography Cunningham was born in 1816 to Louisa and Robert Cunningham and lived all her life on her parents' Rosemont Plantation in Laurens County, South Carolina. It was devoted to cotton cultivation. She was educated at home and learned to ride horses. Ladies then rode sidesaddle, and she was crippled as a teenager from a riding accident. She never married. While passing Mount Vernon by steamboat on the Potomac River, her mother saw its deteriorated condition and wrote about it to Cunningham. She decided to take on the project of raising money to buy the property for preservation. At that point neither the Commonwealth of Virginia nor the federal government's legislatures would approve such purchases, as they dealt with the impending war. Cunningham was in her 30s when she initiated her campaign, first writing an open letter to a local newspaper addressed to \\"the Ladies of the South\\" to raise money for the first President's home. She founded The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, seeking representative women leaders from each of the 30 states in the union. Cunningham served as its first regent. The Mount Vernon Ladies Association bought Mount Vernon, its outbuilding and 200 acres for $200,000. They were successful in raising all funds needed to complete the purchase from John A. Washington in 1859. This Association is the oldest private preservation organization in the United States. The group still owns and manages Washington's estate and is open to visitors 365 days a year. She is buried at First Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina.

Its collection of maps, globes, and maritime chartsMaritime Charts, Books & Official Publications is considered the world's largest. It has also supplied cartography for the British Army and for James Bond films.  History  At the time of the shop's opening, it was the only mapmaker in London since it commissioned John Bolton as an in-house cartographer. Stanfords opened at the height of global exploration and colonialism, hence, cartographic works were in great demand. The shop quickly expanded to 7 and 8 Charing Cross whilst acquiring premises on Trinity Place for printing works. The store on Long Acre in Covent Garden, central London, was the location of the company's printing business before the entire operation moved there in January 1901. Stanfords was hit by an incendiary bomb in 1941 and it only survived due to the thousands of Ordnance Survey maps tightly stacked on the shop's upper floors, which kept the fire from spreading. For the shop's 150 year anniversary, a National Geographic world map was imposed onto the Ground Floor, as well as a map of the Himalaya and London on the other floors, costing ¬£40,000.Mason, M.

It is a black comedy set in Soho, a fast- paced gangster plot that tells the story of this particular night club's culture. Would-be rock 'n' roll star 'Silver Johnny' is on the road to fame and fortune during the summer of 1958, but encounters problems with his jealous manager, Ezra, the owner of the Atlantic Club, who is hell-bent on protecting him from the amorous advances of creepy local gangster/entrepreneur Sam Ross. Skinny, a member of Johnny's group, and one of the club's pill- popping employees, discovers Ezra sawn in half in separate dustbins, and Ezra's ambitious associate Mickey announces that Ross intends to take over the Atlantic Club. The original cast was Hans Matheson (Silver Johnny), Tom Hollander (Baby), Aidan Gillen (Skinny), Matt Bardock (Sweets), David Westhead (Mickey), and Andy Serkis (Potts).Review of Mojo by Matt Wolf in Variety, 21 August 1995, accessed 25 August 2020. In 2013 the play was revived at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London's West End, again directed by Ian Rickson. The cast included Colin Morgan as Skinny, Rupert Grint, making his stage debut as Sweets, Ben Whishaw as Baby, Daniel Mays as Potts, Brendan Coyle as Mickey and Tom Rhys Harries as Silver Johnny. Plot Set entirely within the seedy Atlantic club, Silver Johnny - a young and talented performer on the road to fame and fortune - is held back by his jealous and protective manager Ezra, owner of the nightclub and father to a psychotic unloved son, Baby. As Silver Johnny progresses up the ladder to stardom, local gangster/entrepreneur Sam Ross begins to take an interest, and the only way to remove opposition (Ezra) appears to be sawing him in half, kidnapping Silver Johnny and leaving the club's fate in a state of limbo. Ezra is discovered the next morning by his second-in-command, the highly ambitious Mickey, who announces that Ross intends to take over the Atlantic Club, setting the stage for a major power struggle; \\"He's been fucking cut in half. He's in two bins...\\" Terrified by the potential threat of extermination by Ross and his gang, associates of the now deceased Ezra, (Potts, Sweets, Skinny and Baby) begin to lose their nerve, and try to convince themselves it's Mickey's idea of a joke; \\"It's Mickey's joke, it's Mickey's morning joke!\\" When this turns out to be false, the Atlantic Club gang prepare for what could be their final night. With just an ancient cutlass and an old Derringer as defence, the group starts to argue amongst themselves and even considers joining Ross, or simply leaving. As the day wears on, people begin to gather outside the club waiting for the doors to open, oblivious to the situation. Sweating it out inside, the small group of four have to break the tragic news of Ezra's grisly death to Baby, who takes the news in a dreamlike, distant manner. Uneasy about Baby's mental stability, the Atlantic gang begins to become restless - especially about their catering. Arguments break out over frivolous matters (Skinny's Uncle Tommy), and the group finally settles to consider just what its rivals are doing at that very moment. In the climax to the fast-paced story, Sweets checks downstairs to see if the coast is clear for the gang to have a little space, rather than being cooped up in a single room, and finds Silver Johnny hanging from the ceiling. In sheer panic, Sweets calls for help, and is joined by the others. Baby reveals that by saving Silver Johnny he killed Mr Ross and discovered that Mickey had betrayed them all for a share in the business. Skinny arrives and insults Baby, who responds by shooting him in the head with the Derringer. Mickey, Potts and Sweets attempt to cover the wound and to calm Skinny down, while Baby wanders around aimlessly. Silver Johnny is lowered to the floor and Skinny dies. Unable to save Skinny's life, Mickey's authority and status break down, and he kneels beside his friend's body. Film version In 1997 a film adaptation was released of the stage play. It was also written and directed by Butterworth.

It presents as an immediate, extreme pain around the injection site, with overlying skin rapidly becoming erythematous, violaceous, or blanched (\\"ischemic pallor\\")James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . and sometimes with reticular pattern. The reaction eventually leads to variable degrees of necrosis to the skin and underlying tissue. The wound eventually heals, but can lead to atrophic, disfiguring scarring. The reaction is associated with a range of both injection sites and drugs. It was first reported by Freudenthal in 1924 following an injection of bismuth salts for syphilis. Although initial reports were following intramuscular injections, the reaction has since also been reported following subcutaneous, intravenous, and intraarticular injections. Livedoid dermatitis has been reported to occur with many different drug injections, including: penicillins, local anesthetics (e.g. lidocaine), vaccines (e.g. Dtap), corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and more. Pathogenesis The cause of this condition is poorly understood. Microscopic examination of affected tissue shows ischemic necrosis, and so various hypotheses exist to explain this ischemia, including vasospasm from needle prick, the injected drug, or cold compresses applied to the wound. Diagnosis  The diagnosis is mainly clinical. Skin biopsies of the site show necrosis caused by ischemia. Radiographic imaging may help to delineate the extent of the wound. Treatment Depending on the extent and state of infection of the wound, the condition may require antibiotics, wound debridement in early stages, and corrective plastic surgery in late stages.

Tri-Cities Opera is notable for its artist training program, and maintains a costume and set rental business to other opera companies for many commonly performed operas. General information Tri-Cities opera was founded in 1949 to serve the community of Greater Binghamton in upstate New York. TCO is organized and focused as a training company for younger artists and is partnered in the community with Binghamton University's music department. For productions, TCO uses these resident artists and rarely engages outside performers. Resident artist training program Since inception, TCO has had a focus on training young opera singers and has created a Resident Artist program, training young opera singers from around the world. Alumnus of the program have gone on to perform at world-renowned opera companies include The Metropolitan Opera and The San Francisco Opera. Artists who have studied and performed at TCO include the tenor Pl√°cido Domingo during the 1965-1966 seasons, and many other well-known opera performers. Resident artists receive instruction at TCO's facilities, main performance space at the Broome County Forum theater and private studios of staff. Skills taught to resident artists include audition skills, acting, stage craft, movement, diction, vocal pedagogy, vocal coaching, and role interpretation. Costume and set productions TCO has production sets and costumes for many of the most commonly performed operas. TCO rents these items to numerous other opera companies for their productions. TCO has facility space to produce, store and maintain these items. Performance venues TCO maintains facilities on Clinton Street in Binghamton, NY, where it has facilities space for costume design, set production and storage, training and practice facilities for artists, and a small performance theater for various smaller, intimate productions or events.

Pope John Paul II reigned as pope of the Roman Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State for 26 years from October 1978 to his death, on 2 April 2005. Since his death, many thousands of people have been supporting the case for beatifying and canonising Pope John Paul II as a saint. His formal beatification ceremony took place on 1 May 2011. Beatification John Paul II's official title was \\"Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of Saint Peter, Head of the College of Bishops, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Patriarch of the West, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City, Servus Servorum Dei, Pope John Paul II\\". In 2006 the title Patriarch of the West was removed from the papal list of titles by the succeeding pope, Benedict XVI, due to its obsolescence. On 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor. Normally five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Vicar Camillo Ruini, the one responsible for promoting the cause for canonisation of any person who dies within the diocese of Rome, cited \\"exceptional circumstances\\" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived. The \\"exceptional circumstances\\" may possibly refer to the people's cries of \\"Santo Subito!\\" (\\"Saint now!\\" in Italian) during the pontiff's funeral. Therefore, the new pope waived the five year rule \\"so that the cause of Beatification and Canonisation of the same Servant of God can begin immediately\\". The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of F√°tima and the 24th anniversary of the assassination attempt on John Paul II at St. Peter's Square. John Paul II often credited Our Lady of F√°tima for preserving him on that day. Cardinal Camillo Ruini, vicar general for the diocese of Rome, officially opened the cause for beatification in the Lateran Basilica on 28 June 2005. In early 2006, it was reported that the Vatican was investigating a possible miracle associated with John Paul II. Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun confined to her bed by Parkinson's Disease, was reported to have woken up free of symptoms on 2 June 2005, \\"after members of her community prayed for the intercession of Pope John Paul II\\". A member of the Congregation of Little Sisters of Catholic Motherhood from Puyricard, near Aix-en-Provence, Simon-Pierre returned to work at a maternity hospital run by her order. She met reporters 30 March 2006 in Aix-en-Provence, during a press conference with Archbishop of Aix Claude Feidt, saying ‚ÄúI am cured, but it is up to the church to say whether it was a miracle or not.‚Äù However, Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported that Simon-Pierre suffered a relapse of her symptoms in 2010, and suggested that Simon-Pierre did not have Parkinson's but a neurological disease with similar symptoms that could go into remission or be cured, noting that there is no easy way to accurately diagnose the disease short of medical autopsy. The Episcopal Conference of France disputed that the relapse (which would have thrown the purportedly miraculous nature of the cure into doubt) was anything more than a rumour. On 28 May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI said Mass before an estimated 900,000 people in John Paul II's native Poland. During his homily he encouraged prayers for the early canonisation of John Paul II and stated that he hoped canonisation would happen \\"in the near future\\". In January 2007, it was announced by Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz of Krak√≥w, his former secretary, that the key interviewing phase in Italy and Poland of the beatification process was nearing completion. The relics of Pope John Paul II‚Äîpieces of white papal cassocks he used to wear‚Äîwere being freely distributed with prayer cards for the cause to interested parties; this distribution and prayerful use of relics is a typical praiseworthy pious practice after a saintly Catholic's death. On 8 March 2007 the Vicariate of Rome announced that the diocesan phase of John Paul's cause for beatification was at an end. Following a ceremony on 2 April 2007 ‚Äì the second anniversary of the Pontiff's death ‚Äì the cause proceeded to the scrutiny of the committee of lay, clerical, and episcopal members of the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, who will conduct an investigation of their own. On the fourth anniversary of Pope John Paul's death, 2 April 2009, Dziwisz told reporters of a presumed miracle that had recently occurred at the former pope's tomb in St. Peter's Basilica. A nine-year-old Polish boy from Gda≈Ñsk, who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk, had been visiting the tomb with his parents. On leaving St. Peter's Basilica, the boy told them, \\"I want to walk\\", and began walking normally. In October 2009, Rome's mayor Gianni Alemanno said that the beatification, likely to draw huge crowds, was expected to take place in 2010, but on 4 November 2009 Monsignor Slawomir Oder, postulator of the cause of beatification, said that it was not yet known when study of the case could be concluded.Wooden, Cindy (5 November 2009) \\"Pope John Paul's legacy continues to touch people, cardinal says\\". Catholic News Service. Retrieved 7 May 2012 On 16 November 2009, a panel of reviewers at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints voted unanimously that Pope John Paul II had lived a life of virtue. If Pope Benedict XVI agrees, he will sign the first of two decrees needed for beatification. The first recognises that he lived a heroic, virtuous life and enables him to be called \\"Venerable\\", the next step in the sainthood process. That decree was signed by Pope Benedict XVI on Saturday, 19 December 2009. The second vote and the second signed decree would recognise the authenticity of his first miracle (most likely, the case of Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, the French nun who was cured of Parkinson's Disease). Once the second decree is signed, the ‚Äòpositio‚Äô (the report on the cause, with documentation about his life and his writings and with information on the cause) is regarded as being complete. He can then be beatified. John Paul II was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI on 1 May 2011. Prior to the announcement of the beatification, some ecclesiastical authorities had expressed concern that the cure of Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, and perhaps the cure of the boy who had cancer, may not be complete and lasting, as it has not been that long since the supposed miracles. Sister Marie's symptoms were analyzed very thoroughly before the beatification was announced (by the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints and its medical panel for the Pope's case) to make sure they were not actually psychogenic, or related to another disease. The medical miracle was given a positive affirmation by the Congregation and its medical and theological panels, and by Pope Benedict. It would not have counted as a miracle if the cause was psychogenic and if the immediate physiological cure had not been judged to be definitive, total, and permanent, as well as directly attributable to his intercession. Another reported miracle was that of Floribeth Mora Diaz. She was a Costa Rican lawyer who was cured of an incurable brain tumour. In this case, neurosurgeons were consulted by the authorities at the Vatican. Diaz was invited to the beatification ceremony. Ceremony Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz kisses the casket of John Paul II The beatification ceremony of Pope John Paul II was held on 1 May 2011 and was presided over by Pope Benedict XVI. A vigil in preparation for the celebration was held the night before in the Circus Maximus.\\"The Vigil: testimonies and prayer\\" Radio Vaticana, 30 April 2011 The casket in which he was interred was exhumed and placed before Saint Peter's tomb on 29 April 2011. It was placed in front of the main altar for public veneration during the ceremony. After the ceremony, the casket was reinterred in the Chapel of St Sebastian. A vial containing the Pope's blood, taken during the final days of his life, was displayed as a relic for veneration. The reliquary in which the vial was kept during the ceremony was carried by Sister Marie, and Sister Tobiann (who nursed the Pope during his illness). A total of 87 international delegations attended the ceremony, including 22 world leaders. Amid controversy, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe also attended the ceremony despite a European Union- wide travel ban imposed on him. He was able to travel freely into the Vatican via Rome due to a treaty that allows individuals wanting to travel to the Vatican to pass through Italy. His travel ban was waived by the EU. One million Catholics gathered for the mass at Saint Peter's Square, where a giant portrait of the former Pope was set up. The Prefecture of the Papal Household, Bishop James Michael Harvey, has issued a draft program for the Beatification of John Paul II, describing it as \\"a great ecclesial event,\\" the office in charge of organising audiences and handles ticketing for all papal events at the Vatican, issued a statement that began ‚Äútickets are not needed to attend the beatification ceremony‚Äù.\\"The Program of the Beatification of John Paul II \\" .

Catholic newspaper discusses reservations over beatification Calling into question both the validity of the purported miracle and also asking whether the purported miracle should be attributed to John Paul II rather than the prayers of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre to any other saint. Catholics question beatification There has been criticism of the rapidity of the beatification in light of the sexual abuse scandals.Newsweek article criticising the beatification > Much of the abuse, or its alleged cover-up, occurred while John Paul II was > Pope, from 1979‚Äì2005, and the Church has been criticised for not doing > enough to punish those found responsible. John Paul II has been criticised (more than perhaps any other issue) for not recognising the full severity of the sex abuse cases until they erupted in America in 2002. He has also been criticised for hindering the investigation into the charges of sexual immorality leveled against Father Marcial Maciel Degollado and for allowing diocesan bishops to transfer pedophile priests from one parish to another instead of reporting their crimes to the authorities. John Paul further stands accused of hindering Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger who allegedly was attempting to prevent sex abuse. Meanwhile, Pope Benedict stands accused of deliberately hushing up the abundance of public and private affection displayed between John Paul II and Father Marciel. According to the National Catholic Reporter, a recent leak of 212 Vatican documents shows a fuller story: > \\"Ratzinger wanted to elevate John Paul to beatification,\\" said [Jos√©] Barba, > coauthor of La Voluntad de No Saber (\\"The Will Not to Know\\"), an analysis of > Vatican documents on Maciel [leaked in late 2011].

By > keeping a lid on Maciel's secret life, Barba said, Benedict hoped \\"to defend > the sainthood case against the accusations that John Paul protected > predators.\\" After the formal beatification ceremony on 1 May 2011, Pope Benedict could be more forthcoming in acknowledging the depth of Father Marciel's crimes. Meanwhile, Jason Berry has documented how the million dollar gifts of Father Marciel to John Paul II served to cement their friendship and to assure Marciel of papal immunity from prosecution.[Jason Berry, Render Unto Rome: The Secret Life of Money in the Catholic Church (NY: Random House, 2011), 156‚Äì196.] List of dignitaries at the beatification *: President Bamir Topi *: The King of the Belgians and Queen Paola *: Vice-President Michel Temer, representing President Dilma Rousseff *: Chairwoman of the National Assembly Tsetska Tsacheva\\"–î–Ω–µ—Å –æ–±—è–≤—è–≤–∞—Ç –ø–∞–ø–∞ –ô–æ–∞–Ω –ü–∞–≤–µ–ª II –∑–∞ –±–ª–∞–∂–µ–Ω \\" Visit Info *: President Denis Sassou Nguesso *: President Toomas Hendrik Ilves *: President of the European Commission Jos√© Manuel Barroso, President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzekhttp://www.uniaeuropejska.org/wszystkie-drogi-prowadz-do-rzymu *: Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon *: President Porfirio Lobo Sosa *: Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n *: Government Chief Whip Paul Kehoe *: Minister without portfolio Yossi Peled *: President Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Senate Renato Schifani, President of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi *: Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius *: President of Mexico Felipe Calder√≥n *: Minister without portfolio Ziad El Bandak *: President Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski, former President and leader of Solidarity, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa *: The Prince and Princess of Asturias, Minister of the Presidency Ram√≥n Jauregui *: Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah, representing President Ma Ying-jeou *: The Duke of Gloucester, representing the Queen *: President Robert Mugabe Title \\"the Great\\" Tomb of John Paul II in The Chapel of St. Sebastian Since the death of John Paul II, a number of clergy at the Vatican and laymen throughout the world have been referring to the pontiff as \\"John Paul the Great\\"‚Äîonly the fourth pope to be so acclaimed, and the first since the first millennium. Scholars of Canon Law say that there is no official process for declaring a pope \\"Great\\"; the title simply establishes itself through popular and continued usage. The three popes who today commonly are known as \\"Great\\" are: Leo I, who reigned from 440‚Äì461 and persuaded Attila the Hun to withdraw from Rome; Gregory I, 590‚Äì604, after whom the Gregorian Chant is named; and Pope Nicholas I, 858‚Äì867. His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, referred to him as \\"the great Pope John Paul II\\" in his first address from the loggia of St Peter's Basilica, and he referred to Pope John Paul II as \\"the Great\\" in his published written homily for the Mass of Repose. The Statue of Pope John Paul the Great in Sydney, Australia Since giving his homily at the funeral of Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI has continued to refer to John Paul II as \\"the Great\\".

AGEP is characterized by sudden skin eruptions that appear on average five days after a medication is started. These eruptions are pustules, i.e. small red white or red elevations of the skin that contain cloudy or purulent material (pus).James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . The skin lesions usually resolve within 1‚Äì3 days of stopping the offending medication. However, more severe cases are associated with a more persistent disorder that may be complicated by secondary skin infections and/or involvement of the liver, lung, and/or kidney. Severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) disorders are regarded as the drug-induced activation of T cells which then initiate innate immune responses that are inappropriately directed against self tissues. Studies on the DRESS syndrome, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and SJS/TEN overlap indicate that many individuals are predisposed to develop these reactions to a particular medication based on their genetically- determined expression of particular human leukocyte antigen (i.e. HLA) alleles or T-cell receptors and/or their efficiencies in adsorbing, distributing to tissues, metabolizing, and/or eliminating) a particular SCARS-inducing medication. Evidence for these predispositions in AGEP has not been as well- established. Signs and symptoms AGEP is an acute drug eruption characterized by numerous small, primarily non-follicular, sterile skin pustules arising within large areas of red swollen skin usually within days of taking an inciting drug. The skin eruptions are often pruritic and accompanied by fever, headache, a high number of neutrophils and eosinophils in the blood, and elevated blood levels of markers for inflammation (i.e. erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein). The skin eruptions typically end within a week after causative drug is discontinued. Rare cases of lung and bone marrow involvement have also been reported to complicate AGEP. However, involvement of these organs typically resolve along with the skin eruptions. AGEP typically shows a mild course: usually, it is not associated with life- threatening complicates although superinfections of skin lesions may be serious or even life-threatening. AGEP has a mortality rate of less than 5%.  Cause  About 90% of AGEP reactions are associated with medications. The remaining cases of AGEP have been associated with infective and other agents.  Medicines  The most frequently reported drugs that have been associated with the development of AGEP include penicillin, aminopenicillins, macrolides, quinolones, sulfonamides, hydroxychloroquine, terbinafine, and diltiazem. A more complete list of drugs sorted by their intended actions are: *Antibiotics: Penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, clindamycin, cephalexin, cefepime, cefoxitin, cefazolin, various sulfonamides, various quinolones, vancomycin, levofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem, pristinamycin *Antifungals: Terbinafine, ketoconazole, fluconazole *Anti-inflammatories: Aspirin, celecoxib *Other agents: Hydroxychloroquine (an antimalarial agent), diltiazem (a calcium channel blocker), omeprazole (a proton-pump inhibitor), clenbuterol (a decongestant and bronchodilator), clopidogrel (an indirectly acting platelet inhibitor)  Microbe infections  Infections with Parvovirus B19, mycoplasma, cytomegalovirus, coxsackie B4 virus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, E. coli, and Echinococcus have been reported to be associated with the development of AGEP in the absence of an apparent drug-induced cause. The pathophysiology for the development of these drug-independent cases of AGEP is unclear. Viral infections have also been observed to be associated with the development of SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN in the absence of a causative drug.  Other agents  Herbal medications, spider bites, iopamidol (used for radiocontrast), lacquers, mercury, psoralen (combined with ultraviolet A to treat psoriasis), and xenobiotics have been associated with the development of AGEP in case reports.  Pathophysiology  Like other drug-induced SCARs disorders, AGEP is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction in which a drug or its metabolite stimulates cytotoxic T cells (i.e. CD8+ T cells) or T helper cells (i.e. CD4+ T cells) to initiate autoimmune reactions that attack self tissues. SCARs are type IV, subtype IVb (DRESS syndrome), type IV, subtype IVc (SJS, SJS/TEN, TEN), or type IV, subtype IVd (AGEP) hypersensitivity reactions. AGEP therefore differs from the other SCARs disorders in that it involves the tissue-injuring action of inappropriately activated neutrophils and the excessive production of cytokines which stimulate production of, recruit to tissues, and/or activation of neutrophils (Interleukin 8, Interleukin 17, GM- CSF) and promote innate immune and autoimmune responses (Interleukin 22). AGEP also differs from the other SCARs disorders in respect to the level of evidence supporting the underlying mechanism by which a drug or its metabolite stimulates CD8+ T or CD4+ T cells. Studies indicate that the mechanism by which a drug or its metabolites accomplishes this stimulation involves subverting the antigen presentation pathways of the innate immune system. A drug or metabolite covalently binds with a host protein to form a non-self, drug-related epitope. An antigen-presenting cell (APC) takes up these proteins; digests them into small peptides; places the peptides in a groove on the human leukocyte antigen (i.e. HLA) component of their major histocompatibility complex (i.e. MHC) (APC); and presents the MHC-associated peptides to the T-cell receptor on CD8+ T or CD4+ T cells. Those peptides expressing a drug-related, non-self epitope on their HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA- DM, HLA-DO, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, or HLA-DR proteins may bind to a T-cell receptor to stimulate the receptor-bearing parent T cell to attack self tissues. Alternatively, a drug or metabolite may also stimulate T cells by inserting into the groove on a HLA protein to serve as a non-self epitope, bind outside of this groove to alter a HLA protein so that it forms a non-self epitope, or bypass the APC by binding directly to a T cell receptor. However, non-self epitopes must bind to specific HLA serotypes to stimulate T cells and the human population expresses some 13,000 different HLA serotypes while an individual expresses only a fraction of them. Since a SCARs-inducing drug or metabolite interacts with only one or a few HLA serotypes, their ability to induce SCARs is limited to those individuals who express HLA serotypes targeted by the drug or metabolite. Thus, only rare individuals are predisposed to develop SCARs in response to a particular drug on the bases of their expression of HLA serotypes. Studies have identified several HLA serotypes associated with development of DRESS syndrome, SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN in response to various drugs which elici these disorders, developed tests to identify individuals who express these serotypes, and thereby determined that these individuals should avoid the offending drug. HLA serotypes associated with AGEP and specific drugs have not been identified. A study conducted in 1995 identified of HLA-B51, HLA-DR11, and HLA-DQ3 of unknown serotypes to be associated with development of AGEP but the results have not been confirmed, expanded to identify the serotypes involved, nor therefore useful in identifying individuals predisposed to develop AGEP in response to any drug. Similarly, a specific T cell receptor variant has been associated with the development of DRESS syndrome, SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN but not AGEP. Variations in ADME, i.e. an individuals efficiency in absorbing, distributing, metabolizing, and excreting a drug) has been found to occur in cases of the DRESS syndrome, SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN. These variations influence the levels and duration of a drug or drug metabolite in tissues and thereby impact the drug's or drug metabolite's ability to evoke SCARs. In rare cases, the development of AGEP has been reported to occur in individuals with loss of function mutations in their IL36RN gene. This gene codes for the interleukin 36 receptor antagonist (IL36RA). IL36RA blocks the pro-inflammatory actions of Interleukin-36 cytokines (viz., IL-36Œ±, IL-36Œ≤ and IL-36Œ≥) on keratinocytes, synoviocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells. It does so by binding to, but not stimulating, these cytokines' receptors, IL1RL2 and IL1RAP, thereby interfering with the interleukin-36 cytokines' binding to and stimulating IL1RL2 and IL1RAP. However, the IL36RN loss of function mutation has been reported in cases of generalized pustular psoriasis. The presence of this mutation in two seemingly unrelated disorders has led to suggestions that the classification of AGEP as a SCARs or a form of psoriasis requires study. Diagnosis The diagnosis of AGEP may be forthright in typical cases in which an individual: has taken a drug known to cause the disorder; develops multiple sterile pustules overlying large areas of red swollen skin starting a few days after initial drug intake; and has a histology of biopsied lesions that shows pustules just below the skin's Stratum corneum (outermost layer), apoptotic (i.e. necrotic) keratinocytes, spongiosis of the stratum spinosum, and infiltration of these tissues by neutrophils plus, in many but not all cases, eosinophils. Many cases of AGEP, however, present less clear cut clinical features of the disorder. AGEP must be differentiated from generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) with which it shares many clinical and histological features. A history of psoriasis, the presence of typical psoriatic skin lesions at the time of diagnosis, and histological evidence in skin lesions of necrotic keratinocytes, neutrophil-rich infiltrates, eosinophil infiltrates, and/or lack of tortuous or dilated blood vessels favors a diagnosis of to AGEP. Other conditions sometimes confused with AGEP include pustular eruptions caused by bacteria, funguses, herpesviridae, and the varicella zoster virus (i.e. causative agent of chicken pox). Several tests have been proposed to be useful for supporting the diagnosis of and/or implicating a particular drug as the cause of AGEP particularly in individuals who develop skin lesions while taking multiple drugs. These include patch tests in which small amounts of suspect drugs absorbed on patches are applied to the skin; skin allergy tests in which drugs are applied by skin prick or intradermal injection; and oral provocation in which drugs are taken in a single small dose orally. These tests have not been widely adopted because of their insensitivity and, most particular with oral provocation tests, the possibility of causing a relapse or worsening or the disorder. In vitro tests, including mixed lymphocyte reaction tests in which the response of individuals' blood mononuclear cells to suspect drugs and ELISPOT tests in which specific drug-reactive lymphocytes or their drug-induced release of AGEP mediators (e.g. interferon-Œ≥ interleukin 4, or granulysin) are measured have likewise not been broadly adopted because of their lack of specificity. Classification The disorder is classified in the group of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (i.e. SCARs). The SCARs group of disorders includes four other drug-induced skin reactions: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome), Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and Stevens‚ÄìJohnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap syndrome (SJS/TEN). SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN, while initially described as distinct adverse drug-induced cutaneous reactions are now regarded as manifestations of epidermal necrolysis differing only in extent of skin involvement. While all of five SCARs disorders are potentially lethal, AGEP has the lowest mortality of the group. Treatment The treatment of AGEP begins with the immediate cessation of the offending drug. For individuals developing AGEP while taking multiple drugs, non-essential drugs should be discontinued and essential drugs should be replaced by chemically unrelated drugs that are used as alternatives to the discontinued drug(s). In cases of multiple drug intake, skin and/or in vitro testing may be of some use in identifying the offending drug. Beyond identifying and discontinuing the offending drug, individuals with mild symptoms may require no further treatment. Those troubled by more significant symptoms such as itching or fever may require antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, and/or antipyretics. Individuals suffering liver, lung, kidney, and/or severe skin complications may require high dosage systemic corticosteroids and organ-specific interventions. Skin infections, which may lead to sepsis, are potentially lethal complications of AGEP; preventative methods and rapid treatment of such infections with appropriate antibiotics and, where needed, further supportive measures are critical in the treatment of this complication. Overall, however, AGEP has a lethality of less than 5% with recent reports showing no fatalities.

The first airship Willows No. 1 flew in 1905, and the last, the Willows No. 5 in 1913. Design and development= Willows No. 1  First flown for 85 minutes by the nineteen-year-old Willows from East Moors, Cardiff in Wales on 5 August 1905, the No. 1 was a small semi-rigid of 12,600 cubic feet (354 m¬≥). The 74 ft (22.55 m) long and 18 ft (5.5 m) diameter envelope was made from silk and had a framework gondola suspended beneath it. At the rear of the framework was a twin-cylinder Peugeot motorcycle engine fitted with a two-bladed 10 ft (3 m) pusher propeller. The Willows No. 1 undertook six flights with the longest lasting two hours.  Willows No. 2  Willows next airship the Willows No. 2 first flew on 26 November 1909. No. 2 was 86 ft (26.2 m) long and 22 ft (6.7 m) in diameter with a 29,000 cubic feet (820 m¬≥) volume. On 4 June 1910 Willows landed the No. 2 outside of Cardiff City Hall and then flew back to his shed at East Moors. On 11 July 1910 it flew from Cheltenham to Cardiff and the following month on 6 August it returned to London. The flight was a record for a cross-country flight in Britain and Willows was the first aviator to cross the Bristol Channel in a powered aircraft. The No. 2 was powered by a JAP air-cooled V8 engine and had two swivelling propellers mounted either side of the suspended car. It was also fitted with a rudder for directional control.  Willows No. 3 - City of Cardiff  Willows No. 2 was re-built and lengthened to 120 ft (36.56 m) with a diameter of 40 ft (12.2 m) and a volume of 32,000 cubic feet (905 m¬≥). It retained the same JAP engine which powered two 6 ft (1,83 m) propellers. No. 3 first flew on 29 October 1910 over White City in London, England. Willows renamed his airship the City of Cardiff and on 4 November 1910 left from Wormwood Scrubs for France, thus becoming the first airship to cross the English Channel at night and the first from England to France. The journey was not without problems; the maps were dropped over the side during the night, and problems with the envelope caused the airship to land at Corbehem near Douai at two o'clock in the morning. With the help of local French aviator Louis Breguet, the airship was repaired and arrived at Paris on 28 December 1910. Willows celebrated New Year's Eve with a flight around the Eiffel Tower.  Willows No. 4 - His Majesty's Naval Airship No. 2  The next Willows airship the Willows No.4 was slightly smaller but more streamlined than the No. 3. Completed in 1912 it had a 24,000 cubic feet (680 m¬≥) capacity, a length of 110 ft (33.5 m) and a diameter of 20 ft (6,10 m). The envelope had a keel on which was mounted a Anzani engine driving two four-bladed steerable propellers. Below the keel was suspended a two-man gondola. After rejection by the Army, No. 4 was bought for ¬£1,050 in September 1912 by the Admiralty and it became His Majesty's Naval Airship No. 2. In 1913 it was given a larger capacity envelope of 39,000 cu feet (11,000 m¬≥). By 1914 the original gondola was replaced with a three-seat version with dual controls but it only made one flight in this configuration. The envelope of this airship was used for the prototype of the very successful SS class airship which was used for anti U-boat activities in World War I. Willows No. 5 Following the sale of No. 4, Willows established a spherical gas balloon school at Welsh Harp, Hendon. During this time he developed a new airship, the Willows No. 5 with a rubberised fabric and a volume of 50,000 cubic feet (1,415 m¬≥). First flown on 27 November 1913 the No. 5 had a gondola which could carry four people. It made a number of flights from Hendon over central London in February 1914.

The HTLVs belong to a larger group of primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs). Members of this family that infect humans are called HTLVs, and the ones that infect Old World monkeys are called Simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLVs). To date, four types of HTLVs (HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HTLV-3, and HTLV-4) and four types of STLVs (STLV-1, STLV-2, STLV-3, and STLV-5) have been identified. HTLV types HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 viruses are the first retroviruses which were discovered. Both belong to the oncovirus subfamily of retroviruses and can transform human lymphocytes so that they are self-sustaining in vitro. The HTLVs are believed to originate from interspecies transmission of STLVs. The HTLV-1 genome is diploid, composed of two copies of a single-stranded RNA virus whose genome is copied into a double-stranded DNA form that integrates into the host cell genome, at which point the virus is referred to as a provirus. A closely related virus is bovine leukemia virus BLV. The original name for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was HTLV-3. HTLV-1 HTLV-1 is an abbreviation for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, also called human T-cell leukemia type 1, a virus that has been implicated in several kinds of diseases, including tropical spastic paraparesis, and as a virus cancer link for leukemia (see adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma). HTLV-1 has six reported subtypes (subtypes A to F). The great majority of infections are caused by the cosmopolitan subtype A. HTLV was discovered by Robert Gallo and colleagues in 1980. Between 1 in 20 and 1 in 25 infected people are thought to develop cancer as a result of the virus. HTLV-1 infection is thought to spread only through dividing cells since reverse transcriptase generates proviral DNA from genomic viral RNA, and the provirus is integrated into the host genome by viral integrase after transmission. Therefore, the quantification of provirus reflects the number of HTLV-1-infected cells. So, an increase in numbers of HTLV-1-infected cells using cell division, by actions of accessory viral genes, especially Tax, may provide an enhancement of infectivity. Tax expression induces proliferation, inhibits the apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected cells and, conversely, evokes the host immune response, including cytotoxic T cells, to kill virus-infected cells. Figure 1. Mycosis fungoides, a skin disease showing nodules and plaques composed of lymphocytes spread across the skin, has been associated with HTLV- II infection. Figure 2. A phylogeny of the subtypes of HTLV and their relationships between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses in the human genome. HERV = human endogenous retrovirus, SFV = simian foamy virus. HTLV-2 A virus closely related to HTLV-1, also discovered by Robert Gallo and colleagues. The family of Human T-lymphotropic virus (Figure 2) can be further categorized into four sub types. The figure also divides the retroviruses into exogenous and endogenous. Retroviruses can exist as two different forms: endogenous which consist of normal genetic components and exogenous which are horizontally transferred genetic components that are usually infectious agents that cause disease i.e. HIV. In (Figure 3) open reading frames (ORF) are shown which can if translated can predict which genes will be present and this can help to better understand human retroviruses. Of the four subtypes, HTLV-2 may be linked to Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). In one study involving cultured lymphocytes from patients with mycosis fungoides (Figure 1), PCR amplification showed gene sequences of HTLV-II. This finding may suggest a possible correlation with HTLV-2 and CTCL. Further research and studies must be conducted to show a positive relationship. HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 have been used to describe recently characterized viruses. These viruses were discovered in 2005 in rural Cameroon, and were, it is presumed, transmitted from monkeys to hunters of monkeys through bites and scratches. * HTLV-3 is similar to STLV-3 (Simian T-lymphotropic virus 3). Multiple strains have been identified. It expresses gag, pol, and env, among other proteins. * HTLV-4 is apparently substantially identical to STLV-4 hosted in gorillas. It is not yet known how much further transmission has occurred among humans, or whether the viruses can cause disease. The use of these names can cause some confusion, because the name HTLV-3 was one of the names for HIV in early AIDS literature, but has since fallen out of use. The name HTLV-4 has also been used to describe HIV-2. A large Canadian study documented this confusion among healthcare workers, where >90% of HTLV tests ordered by physicians were actually intended to be HIV tests. [8] Betaretroviruses (such as HERV-K) are found in mice, primates and sheep. Deltaretroviruses include bovine leukemia virus and HTLV-1 and -2. Gammaretroviruses include the murine leukemia virus and the feline leukemia virus but also viruses that infect reptiles and birds. Lentiviruses include HIV. Spumaviruses or foamyviruses include SFV and HERV-L. Abbreviations: LTR = long terminal repeat, consisting of the U3, R and U5 regions in the integrated provirus, gag = group-specific-antigen, du = dUTPase, pro = protease, pol = polymerase (reverse transcriptase and integrase), env = envelope, bel 1-3 (bel 1 is also known as tas;the bel 2 reading frame overlaps with another one named bet), tax, rex, tat, rev, vpu, vif, nef and vprencode small additional proteins. The HERV-K Rec protein is also known as K-Rev. HERV-K rec is found in HERV-K type II proviruses, while np9 is encoded by HERV-K type I proviruses. In spumavirus, either gag-pro or pro-pol are encoded in the same translational reading frame. Transmission HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 can be transmitted sexually, by blood to blood contact (e.g. by blood transfusion or sharing needles when using drugs) and via breast feeding. Epidemiology Two HTLVs are well established. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are both involved in actively spreading epidemics, affecting 15-20 million people worldwide. HTLV-1 is the most clinically significant of the two: at least 500,000 of the individuals infected with HTLV-1 eventually develop an often rapidly fatal leukemia, while others will develop a debilitative myelopathy, and yet others will experience uveitis, infectious dermatitis, or another inflammatory disorder. HTLV-2 is associated with milder neurologic disorders and chronic pulmonary infections. In the United States, HTLV-1/2 seroprevalence rates among volunteer blood donors average 0.016 percent. No specific illnesses have yet been associated with HTLV-3 and HTLV-4. Vaccination and treatments While there is no present licensed vaccine, there are many factors which make a vaccine against HTLV-1 feasible. The virus displays relatively low antigenic variability, natural immunity does occur in humans, and experimental vaccination using envelope antigens has been shown to be successful in animal models. Plasmid DNA vaccines elicit potent and protective immune responses in numerous small- animal models of infectious diseases. However, their immunogenicity in primates appears less potent. In the past two decades a large initiative has been put forth to understand the biological and pathogenic properties of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1); this has ultimately led to the development of various experimental vaccination and therapeutic strategies to combat HTLV-1 infection. These strategies include the development of envelope glycoprotein derived B-cell epitopes for the induction of neutralizing antibodies, as well as a strategy to generate a multivalent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the HTLV-1 Tax antigen. A vaccine candidate that can elicit or boost anti-gp46 neutralizing antibody response may have a potential for prevention and therapy against HTLV-1 infection. Potential treatments include prosultiamine, a vitamin B-1 derivative, which has been shown to reduce viral load and symptoms; azacytidine, an anti-metabolite, which has been credited with the cure of a patient in Greece; tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor used for HIV; cepharanthine, an alkaloid from stephania cepharantha hayata; and phosphonated carbocyclic 2'-oxa-3'aza nucleosides (PCOANs). A newer formulation of TDF, called tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), also has promise as a treatment with less toxicity.

He toured his latest one man comedy show entitled 'Kevin McAleer-Guru' in 2019irishnews.com, October 2019, and played the part of boring Uncle Colm in Derry Girls on Channel 4. Personal life and writing McAleer lives in the countryside of County Tyrone, five miles from Omagh, with his wife Valerie Whitworth, and their three children, daughter Florence Whitworth and twins Louis and Josiah Whitworth. He believes his comic talents blossomed in the classroom and he lived in Barcelona, Spain, for a period. In July 2009, McAleer stated that he has completed a first draft of a book about John F. Kennedy. The book remains unfinished. He writes in his office which is located in Omagh and cites Flann O'Brien, James Joyce, Don DeLillo, Umberto Eco and Nikolai Gogol as influences. McAleer writes occasional comic pieces for the Irish Times, responding to current events such as Brexit. His wife, Valerie Whitworth, is a self-employed artist and a vocal instructor for community choirs in Omagh and Enniskillen.

Previously he served in the House of Representatives of Malta from 1998 to 2008. In 1994 he was elected and nominated first Deputy Mayor of St Julian's. He was born in a working-class family and joined the Labour Party at a very early age.  Background  Joseph Cuschieri was born in Attard. Before becoming a politician, he worked in the textile industry, at the dockyards, journalism and broadcasting, and tourism. He was one of the pioneers who set up Super One Radio (now ONE Radio), where he worked as a journalist and broadcaster. He was also the personal reporter for then Leader of the Malta Labour Party and Prime Minister, Dr Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici.  Political career  Joseph Cuschieri became active in the Labour Party at the age of 13 when he joined the Labour Youth League in Sliema, Malta.  As a Councillor and Vice Mayor  In 1994 he was elected and nominated first Deputy Mayor of St Julian's, after polling the largest number of votes among independent candidates. In the second local council elections in 1996 he was re-elected with the largest numbers of votes among all candidates.  As a Member of Parliament  Joseph Cuschieri was elected as an MP for three consecutive terms commencing 1998. He garnered a greater share of the vote in 2003 and then in 2008.Malta Department of Information figures From 1998 to 2003 he served, alongside Charles Mangion, as spokesperson for Local Councils. From 2003 to 2008 he served with Karmenu Vella and Evarist Bartolo as spokesperson for tourism, Air Malta, and hotels industry. He was also appointed speaker for the Infrastructure and Capital Projects, together with Charles Buhagiar. During his ten-year parliamentary career Joseph Cuschieri served on delegations to the United Kingdom, Isle of Man, Tunisia, Australia, South Korea, Germany, Palestine, Israel and Jordan, among others.  Altruistic resignation from the House of Representatives  On 29 September 2008 Joseph Cuschieri ceded his parliamentary seat to newly elected Labour leader Dr Joseph Muscat, who at that time was not a Maltese member of Parliament. Thus he made it possible for the new Labour Leader to carry out his duties as Leader of the Opposition in Parliament on behalf of the Malta Labour Party. Joseph Muscat thanked Cuschieri for \\"his extraordinary and generous decision\\", and Charles Mangion, former Deputy Leader of the Labour Party for Parliamentary Affairs and acting Opposition Leader Charles Mangion, described Cuschieri as a hard worker and remarkably altruistic, calling his resignation historically and politically important for the country. Joseph Muscat is now the Prime Minister of Malta. Following are two quotes by the Labour Leader Dr Joseph Muscat dated 20 September 2008 about Joseph Cuschieri resignation from the Parliament of Malta: * \\"Ir-Ri≈ºenja ta' Joseph Cuschieri biex nidƒßol fil-Parlament hija sinjal ta' lealta' assoluta lejn l-ideal tagƒßna.

Joseph Cuschieri as an MEP  Following the entry into force of the Protocol amending Protocol No 36, Joseph Cuschieri was designated as an MEP with effect from 1 December 2011 for the remainder of the 2009-2014 European Parliament parliamentary term. Cuschieri has contested the 2009 European Parliament Elections and has garnered the 4th largest numbers of first count votes among all candidates. In the European Parliament, Joseph Cuschieri was a member of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Head of Delegation of the S&D; Maltese members. In the European Parliament Cuschieri served as a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and a substitute member of the Committee on Regional Development. He was also a member on the Delegation for relations with the Arab Peninsula and the Delegation for relations with South Africa.  Diplomatic career  As of 21 January 2016, Joseph Cuschieri has been appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Malta to the Hellenic Republic.

It traditionally specialised in travel books. In 2010, it began publishing. Its initial Marylebone branch, opened in 1912, claims to be the first custom-built bookshop in the world. Bookshops The Marylebone High Street branch is housed in a former Edwardian bookshop with long oak galleries, graceful skylights and William Morris prints. The older section of the Marylebone shop was completed in 1912, and was originally an antiquarian bookshop called Francis Edwards. It is alleged to be the first custom-built bookshop in the world. A large, walk-in safe is visible near the entrance to the travel gallery, and is where expensive volumes were once stored. The shop was bought by former banker James Daunt and renamed Daunt Books in 1990. It now focuses on first-hand titles (especially travel-related material). The company has branches in Holland Park, Cheapside, Hampstead and Belsize Park. The Owl Bookshop in Kentish Town was bought by Daunt Books, but retains its original name. Daunt Books opened its first branch outside London in Saffron Walden, Essex, under the name Hart‚Äôs Books.

Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. .  Causes  Agents that have been implicated in serum sickness‚Äìlike reactions include cefaclor, amoxicillin, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, ciprofloxacin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, barbiturates, carbamazepine, propranolol, thiouracil, and allopurinol. Metabolites of these drugs might bind with tissue proteins inappropriately, eliciting an acute inflammatory response that typically develops 7‚Äì14 days after initiation of the offending agent. Acute hepatitis B will sometimes be complicated with this syndrome, which often resolves with the onset of jaundice.  Pathogenesis  Serum sickness‚Äìlike reaction is named for its clinical similarity to serum sickness, in which immune complexes are deposited in the skin, joints, and other organs. True serum sickness, a type III hypersensitivity reaction, results in fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, cutaneous eruptions, gastrointestinal disturbances, proteinuria, and significant decreases in serum complement levels; it was originally described after patients were infused with equine immunoglobulins. In contrast, serum sickness‚Äìlike reactions are specific drug reactions that are not associated with circulating immune complexes. Although the exact pathogenesis is poorly understood, serum sickness‚Äìlike reactions are thought to originate from an abnormal inflammatory reaction that occurs in response to defective metabolism of drug byproducts generated during pharmacologic therapy; the metabolic flaw could be a maternally-inherited trait. In vivo hepatic drug biotransformation studies have shown greater lymphocyte killing in subjects with a known history of serum sickness‚Äìlike reactions than in control subjects.  Diagnosis  The reaction generally includes a constellation of fever; urticarial polycyclic wheals (a rash that can look similar to hives with small swellings that overlap each other http://www.nzdoctor.co.nz/in- print/2011/september-2011/7-september-2011/dermatology-update.aspx) with central clearing on the trunk, extremities, face, and lateral borders of the hands and feet; oral edema without mucosal involvement; lymphadenopathy; arthralgias; myalgias; and mild proteinuria. Case reports have noted the absence of fever in serum sickness‚Äìlike reactions to amoxicillin. Laboratory abnormalities include normal or mild decreases in serum C3, C4, and CH50 levels, and mild proteinuria.1,3-5 In contrast to true serum sickness, renal and hepatic involvement is rare. Significant decreases in serum C3, C4, and CH50, reported in the literature for true serum sickness, are rarely described in serum sickness‚Äìlike reaction.  Management  Serum sickness‚Äìlike reaction is an acute self-limited reaction with an ultimately favorable outcome. Treatment is typically symptomatic, but hospitalization may be required for severe cases. While optimal treatment strategies for serum sickness‚Äìlike reactions are not clearly defined in the literature, discontinuation of the suspected agent combined with use of antihistamines,corticosteroids and NSAIDs for symptom control is an appropriate therapeutic route. Case reports have shown that treatment with prednisone, 60 mg daily, and high doses of H1 and H2 antihistamines help resolve the arthralgias and myalgias within 24 hours and the remaining symptoms within 48‚Äì72 hours  See also  * List of cutaneous conditions  Notes  References  * Mener DJ, Negrini C, Blatt A: Itching like mad.

Some medical organizations no longer classify it as a form of classic Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). This is because the Reed-Sternberg cell (RSC) variants (popcorn cells) that characterize this form of the disease invariably express B lymphocyte markers such as CD20 (thus making NLPHL an unusual form of Hodgkin lymphoma), and that (unlike classic HL) NLPHL may progress to diffuse large B cell lymphoma. There are small but clear differences in prognosis between the various forms. Lymphocyte predominant HL is an uncommon subtype composed of vague nodules of numerous reactive lymphocytes admixed with large popcorn-shaped RSC. Unlike classic RSC, the non-classic popcorn-shaped RS cells of NLPHL are CD15 and CD30 negative while positive for the B cell marker CD20. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab has been used in lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma with encouraging results. BCL6 gene rearrangements have been frequently observed. Diagnosis Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular lymphocyte predominant (low power view). Notice the nodular architecture and the areas of \\"mottling\\".(H&E;) Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular lymphocyte predominant (high power view). Notice the presence of L&H; cells, also known as \\"popcorn cells\\". (H&E;) The characteristics of NLPHL differ from classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Lymphocyte predominant (LP) (\\"popcorn\\") cells are present embedded in nodules consisting of B cells and other reactive cells (mainly reactive T cells). Reed-Sternberg and Hodgkin (RSH) cells are rarely seen, and immunohistochemistry shows a different pattern on the malignant cells; RSH cells typically express CD15 and CD30, whereas LP cells lack expression of these markers, but express B cell markers like CD20, CD22, and CD79a and also express the common leukocyte antigen CD45, which is uncommon on RSH cells. The LP cells have scant cytoplasm and one folded or multilobated nuclei with prominent, mostly basophilic nucleoli. Expert pathology review of multiple morphologic and immunophenotypic features including the use of immunohistochemistry is essential. Tumors Tumors generally located in the peripheral lymph nodes which can be detected via PET scan and CT scan. Staging Ann Arbor staging is used to classify tumors and symptoms. Stage IV disease is very rare. Sex There is a male predominance of NLPHL diagnosis. B Symptoms B symptoms may be uncommon. Early Detection Diagnosis usually occurs at an early stage of disease progression. Management A treatment guide provided by NCCN Guidelines for Patients is available,NCCN Guidelines for Patients : NCCN Quick Guide. Hodgkin Lymphoma (Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant HL Treatment) https://www.nccn.org/patients/guidelines/quick_guides/hodgkin/nodular_treatment/index.html# while the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology provides a reference for clinicians.NCCN Guidelines v2.2014 Hodgkin Lymphoma http://williams.medicine.wisc.edu/hodgkins.pdf Any proposed therapeutic strategy must have minimal acute and long-term toxicities. Watch and Wait Watchful waiting (watch and wait) was defined as a period of observation of at least 3 months without any treatment. Surgical Excision Surgical lymph node excision may be carried out at the time of diagnosis in certain cases such in children diagnosed at an early stage of progression. One study found sustained complete remission in half of the cases with a watch-and-wait strategy after surgical lymph node excision at the time of diagnosis. Radiation Therapy Studies indicate that radiation therapy (radio therapy) may reduce the risk of progression in adults. In one study, stage I-II patients treated with radiation therapy showed 10-year cause- specific survival of 98%, and the rate of developing radiotherapy-related second malignancies was not increased by the treatment (1% after 10 years). A study published in 2013 on large group of patients with early-stage NLPHL indicated support for using limited-field radiation therapy as the sole treatment of early-stage disease. In a study of 1,162 NLPHL patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry program, radiation therapy improved overall survival and disease specific survival. Immunotherapy An example antibody for use in immunotherapy is Rituximab. Rituximab has specific use in treatment of NLPHL as it is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the protein CD20. Studies indicate Rituximab offers potential in relapsed or refractory patients, and also in front-line treatment especially in advanced stages. Because of a tendency for relapse, maintenance treatment such as every 6 months for 2 years is suggested. Rituximab has been shown to improve patient outcomes after histological transformation. Chemotherapy Possible options such as anthracycline- containing regimens include ABVD, BEACOPP and CHOP. Results of a trial with COPP/ABV in children suggested positive results with chemotherapy alone are possible without the need for radiation therapy. Optimal chemotherapy is a topic for debate, for example there is evidence of support for treatment with R-CHOP instead of ABVD, results showing high rates (40%) of relapse after 10 years since ABVD chemotherapy. BEACOPP has higher reported toxicity risk. Combined treatment One study reported combined radiation therapy (radio therapy) and antibody Rituximab. R-CHOP optionally followed by radiation therapy is recommended in newly diagnosed late stage disease, while for early stage disease radio therapy alone (stage IA without risk factors) or a brief ABVD-based chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy (early stages other than stage IA without risk factors) was advised. Prognosis Prognosis is favourable in comparison with classic HL despite a tendency for disease recurrence requiring long term followup. Relapse can occur at a comparatively late stage in comparison to classic HL. There is limited information regarding the outcome for patients with advanced-stage progression. Ethnicity One study in the United States has suggested improved overall survival in response to chemotherapy for African Americans. Histological Transformation Histologic transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can occur in up to 12% of cases. After transformation, neoplastic cells carry monoclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. Histological transformation may lead to poor prognosis and therefore repeat biopsy is required at relapse. One study found a transformation rate of 7.6%, and suggested that prior exposure to chemotherapy and a presentation with splenic involvement were associated with increased risks of transformation.

Early Life and Family Burns was born in Basseterre and had seven siblings. His father was James Patrick Burns and mother Agnes Zulma Delisle Burns. His father was treasurer of St. Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla and died in 1896. Amongst his siblings were brothers Cecil Delisle Burns, a secularist writer and lecturer, Robert Edward Burns, also in the Colonial Service and Emile Burns a leading British Communist.

In the same year he married Kathleen Fitzpatrick Hardtman with two daughters named Barbara and Benedicta.Hardtman Family . Career Burns had several posts at the Colonial Service. He served on the Leeward Islands from 1905 to 1912 and in 1912 became Supervisor of Customs in Nigeria and enlisted in the West Africa Frontier Force. He served in the Cameroons Campaign and became Adjutant of the Nigeria Land Contingent. Burns was Private Secretary to Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard then Hugh Clifford during their times as Governors of Nigeria. In 1924, he was appointed Colonial Secretary of the Bahamas where he served until 1929 and in which time he carried out the duties of Governor on several occasions. From 1929 to 1934 he was Deputy Chief Secretary to Government of Nigeria. Then, at the age of 47, was posted to British Honduras, where he was governor from 2 November 1934 until 24 February 1939. In 1940, he was seconded to the Colonial Office on special duty in the rank of Assistant Under-Secretary. Burns was appointed Governor of the Gold Coast in 1941. In 1942, he served for five months as Acting Governor of Nigeria.

The jury (consisting of 6 Gold Coast natives and one European) convicted 8 men of the murder, but the accused had a well funded defence with the leading lawyer a nationalist politician and relation of some of the accused. The defence launched appeals to the UK parliament and attempted to portray the trial as a case of white oppression and smear the Governor for supporting the court's decision. This got a degree of support from politicians in the UK that hadn't researched the facts of the case and didn't realise that the court and the Governor had a wide degree of support in the matter from the local population. This caused the case to drag on for years.https://ekownelson.wordpress.com/2018/05/23/the-kyebi-ritual-murder- intensified-the-struggle-for-independence-so-why-has-it-disappeared-from- public-discourse/ Burns resigned as Governor shortly after the Privy Council had rejected the final appeal in the case. His exact reasons for resigning are not clear, especially considering the amount of support he had, but it is possible, that with the leading lawyer in the case using it to further his own political career, Burns felt that his continued presence may detract from peaceful progress.

He became the first person in the United Kingdom to hold a pilots certificate for an airship when the Royal Aero Club awarded him Airship Pilots Certificate No. 1. Willows was born in Cardiff, Wales on 11 July 1886. He was educated at Clifton College in Bristol, entering the school in 1896 and leaving in 1901 aged 15 to train as a dentist. He built his first airship, the Willows No. 1, in 1905 when he was 19. It was first flown from East Moors, Cardiff on 5 August 1905, the flight lasting 85 minutes. This was soon followed by an improved Willows No. 2, in which he landed outside Cardiff City Hall on 4 June 1910. No. 2 was re-built as No. 3 which he named the City of Cardiff before he flew it from London to Paris in 1910. This was the first airship crossing of the English Channel at night and the first from England to France. The journey was not without incident, including dropping the maps over the side during the night, and problems with the envelope caused the airship to land at Corbehem near Douai at two o'clock in the morning. With the help of the local French aviator Louis Breguet the airship was repaired and arrived at Paris on 28 December 1910. He celebrated New Year's Eve with a flight around the Eiffel Tower. Willows moved to Birmingham to build his next airship, the Willows No. 4. First flown in 1912, it was sold to the Admiralty for ¬£1,050 and it became His Majesty's Naval Airship No. 2. With the money from the Navy Willows established a spherical gas balloon school at Welsh Harp, Hendon near London, although this did not stop him building Willows No. 5 in 1913, a four- seater airship designed to give joy rides over London. During the first world war Willows built kite or barrage balloons in Cardiff. After the war he continued with ballooning but on 3 August 1926 he died in a balloon accident at Hoo Park, Kempston, Bedford instantly, together with a passenger. Three other passengers died later that day either in hospital or on their way to it making 5 deaths in all There is a school named Willows High School built on his old airfield to remember him.

History The Vintage Motor Cycle Club was founded on 28 April 1946, by 38 enthusiasts at the Lounge Cafe, Hog's Back, near Guildford in Surrey, for owners of motorcycles manufactured before December 1930. Many of the founders rode to the first meeting on vintage motorcycles and had travelled from around the country in poor weather conditions. The first meeting had been organised by former journalist and wartime despatch rider, the late 'Titch' Allen,Titch Allen tribute Retrieved 2014-05-04 with the aim of promoting the use and preservation of vintage motorcycles manufactured prior to 31 December 1930. The club's activities have expanded over the years to include rallies, hill climbs, trials, a workshop and museum, a library, a sales and wants system for spares and motorcycles, insurance for difficult cases and an annual dinner. VMCC today All makes are catered for regardless of the country of origin. The VMCC has also broadened the 1930 rule to include all motorcycles over 25 years old and has also set up a Post-1960 Section for motorcycle manufactured between 1961 and 1981. Most significantly, it is no longer necessary to own a motorcycle to join the club, which has developed into an organisation for anyone interested in older two-wheelers. The club's head office is at Allen House in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire. Current membership is over 14,000. The most popular section is British historic racing, providing the spectacle of vintage race machines in their proper guise, being ridden competitively against machines of similar age. Races are held every year at all the major circuits in the UK and are well attending by competitors and spectators. The club has been organised into regional sections, most of which have at least one club night each month.

A wing wall (also \\"wingwall\\" or \\"wing-wall\\") is a smaller wall attached or next to a larger wall or structure. Bridges In a bridge, the wing walls are adjacent to the abutments and act as retaining walls. They are generally constructed of the same material as those of abutments. The wing walls can either be attached to the abutment or be independent of it. Wing walls are provided at both ends of the abutments to retain the earth filling of the approaches. Their design depends upon the nature of the embankment and does not depend upon the type or parts of the bridge. The soil and fill supporting the roadway and approach embankment are retained by the wing walls, which can be at a right angle to the abutment or splayed at different angles. The wing walls are generally constructed at the same time and of the same materials as the abutments.  Classification of wing walls  Wing walls can be classified according to their position in plan with respect to banks and abutments. The classification is as follows: #Straight wing walls: used for small bridges, on drains with low banks and for railway bridges in cities (weep holes are provided). #Splayed wing walls: used for bridges across rivers. They provide smooth entry and exit to the water. The splay is usually 45¬∞.

Francis (private collection) John F. Francis (Philadelphia, August 13, 1808 ‚Äì Jeffersonville, West Norriton, November 15, 1886) was an American painter, primarily of still lifes. Biography He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Predominantly self- taught as an artist, he worked until 1845 as a portrait painter in central and eastern Pennsylvania. Francis's portraits reveal his early fascination with minute detail. In 1845 Francis began exhibiting his works at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Philadelphia Art Union; both museums promoted American artists by awarding paintings to subscribers using lottery-like drawings. It was in this period that he began to concentrate on still lifes, which had been established as a popular genre in Philadelphia by Raphaelle Peale and other painters. His first known still life is dated 1850, and by 1854 he had ceased to paint anything else. Francis became known as a leading painter of luncheon and dessert still lifes, developing an intricate vocabulary of forms required by his specialized subject. William H. Gerdts writes, \\"Of all the mid-century still-life specialists, Francis was the most painterly. There is often a freshness and a brio to his paint application that successfully balance his sure delineation of form and his establishment of texture.\\" Nearly all of his paintings depict fruits and desserts. He painted many replicas of his works, with his style displaying little change over the course of his career. According to art historian Alfred Frankenstein, \\"his blond, high-keyed palette always provides one of the most distinctive accents in a general exhibition of American still life\\". Few of his paintings can be dated after 1872, and none after 1880. He was for the most part forgotten by the time of his death in 1886. In 2013 a pair of his still lifes was appraised at $100,000.

Since 1992, she has worked and lived both in Warsaw (Poland) and in Arnhem (Netherlands).  Musical education  After studying piano at the Karol Szymanowski School of Music in Warsaw from 1976 to 1980, Kulenty studied composition with W≈Çodzimierz Koto≈Ñski at the Fryderyk Chopin Music Academy in Warsaw. From 1986 to 1988 she studied composition with Louis Andriessen at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague. In 1984 and 1988 she participated in Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music. In 1983 and 1990 she was participant in the International Courses for Young Composers in Kazimierz, organised by the Polish section of the ISCM ‚Äî where she attended lectures with Iannis Xenakis, Witold Lutos≈Çawski, Thomas Kessler and Fran√ßois- Bernard M√¢che.  Main activities  From 1989 Kulenty worked as a free-lance composer, and received numerous commissions and scholarships. She has composed 2 operas and 12 works for large orchestra. She has written numerous works for solo instruments and chamber groups. Since 2007 she is also involved in writing music for television plays and for film. In 1990 she was for one-year guest composer at the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) in Berlin. In 1998 she was invited as guest lecturer at three universities around Los Angeles. In 1999/2000 she was composer-in-residence with Het Gelders Orkest in the Netherlands. In November 2000 a portrait concert was organized by Deutschlandfunk in Cologne (released on the CD ‚ÄòArcs & Circles‚Äô). She lectured at the Other Minds 10 festival (San Francisco) and at Soundstreams Canada 2005 in Toronto. In 2007 she was guest professor at the ESMUC, Music Academy in Barcelona. She was a jury member during Munich Biennale in 1995, during the Gaudeamus International Composers Award 2002 in Amsterdam, during the Kazimierz Serocki 9th International Composers‚Äô Competition in Warsaw (2003), during the International New Chamber Opera Competition \\"Orpheus-Luciano Berio 2003‚Äì2004\\" in Spoleto, and in 2005 and 2007 during the International Competition of Contemporary Chamber Music in Cracow.  Style and technique of composition  \\"Hanna Kulenty‚Äôs music is permeated with images of organic transformation and growth. The intuitive shaping of evolving sound patterns, extended phrases and richly detailed textures in these works results from Kulenty‚Äôs original compositional technique which she calls ‚Äòthe polyphony of arches‚Äô or ‚Äòarcs‚Äô. The works include many layers of simultaneous ‚Äòarches‚Äô which may begin at different points of their trajectories and proceed at different speeds. Her compositional style has evolved during the years since her dazzling orchestral debut, Ad Unum, a powerful, dissonant, dramatic and well-crafted study of convergence towards musical unity. Since that work, Kulenty‚Äôs preferred medium has been the symphony orchestra. Through the 1990s the composer developed an original version of ‚Äòpost-minimalist‚Äô style, characterized by a reduction of the number and density of musical layers, in comparison with the earlier, saturated and dramatic style of the ‚Äòpolyphony of arches‚Äô. She called this style her version of the ‚ÄòEuropean trance music‚Äô. Kulenty seldom used sudden textural cuts and shifts in this period. Instead, she often structured her compositions as single, powerful arches, slowly evolving in time, gradually increasing their gripping intensity of emotion. Her penchant for musical drama and intensity of emotion found a suitable expression in her music for stage. The ‚Äòintuitive constructivism‚Äô coupled with a heightened emotional intensity of her music is well-suited for highlighting dramatic situations. Kulenty‚Äôs mastery of time and her ability to structure her musical material into layers moving inexorably, inevitably towards powerful climaxes brings a symphonic dimension to her other theatrical compositions. Kulenty‚Äôs latest compositional technique of the ‚Äòpolyphony of time dimensions‚Äô emphasizes the circularity of time and the simultaneity of time-events occurring on different temporal planes.\\" Trochimczyk, Maja. 2003. \\"The music of Hanna Kulenty\\". In Hanna Kulenty ‚Äì Donemus composer brochure. Amsterdam: MuziekGroep Nederland, 2004.  Awards  In 1985 Kulenty was awarded the second prize of the European Young Composers‚Äô Competition organized in Amsterdam with Ad Unum for orchestra (1985). In 1987 she was awarded the Stanislaw Wyspianski Award (2nd class). In the same year she was awarded the second prize by the Young Composers‚Äô Competition of the Polish Composers‚Äô Union with Ride for 6 percussionists (1987). She was also awarded prizes in the Composers‚Äô Competition from the Warsaw branche of the Polish Composers‚Äô Union: Quinto for 2 piano‚Äôs (1986), first prize; Breathe for string orchestra (1987), first prize;Cannon for violin and piano (1988) third prize; aaa TRE for viola, cello and double bass (1988) second prize 1989. In 2003 her composition Trumpet Concerto (2002) won the first prize at the 50th International Rostrum of Composers, for which she received the UNESCO Mozart Medal from the International Music Council. Her compositions Preludium, Postludium and Psalm, for cello and accordion (2007) and String Quartet No. 3 ‚Äì Tell me about it (2008), were respectively chosen among the ten best Dutch compositions of 2007 and 2008 during the ‚ÄòToonzetters‚Äô contest in Amsterdam.  About the performances  Kulenty‚Äôs compositions have been premiered at festivals throughout the world, such as the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, Munich Biennale, Warsaw Autumn, and Musica Polonica Nova. Her numerous orchestral pieces have been performed by symphony orchestras in the Netherlands (Radio Filharmonisch Orkest), Denmark (Danish National Symphony Orchestra), Poland, and Germany (Radio- Symphonie-Orchester Berlin), with conductors such as David Porcelijn, Antoni Wit, Peter Hirsch, Peter E√∂tv√∂s, Ingo Metzmacher, Renato Rivolta, and Ronald Zollman. Soloists such as Isabelle van Keulen, Elisabeth Chojnacka, Krzysztof BƒÖkowski, Marco Blaauw, and Frank Peters have performed her work, as have the Dutch ensemble De Ereprijs, who commissioned her to write pieces on several occasions.

History  Incarcerated Hispanic men from major Texas cities (including Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin), have banded together for protection from established security threat groups like Mexikanemi and the Texas Syndicate. Each regional group is individually called a Tango. These Tangos began forming in the 1980s and may have roots back as far as the 1970s. The term Tango Blast, in actuality, does not refer to a separate group. Rather, it refers to the idea that a particular Tango member is more criminally active than others. Some Tango members say that Tango is an acronym for \\"Together Against Negative Gang Organizations\\". However, Tango originally meant something like 'hometown clique.'  Structure  Although often referred to as a prison gang, Tango Blast is different than traditional prison gangs such as Mexikanemi and the Texas Syndicate, lacking the typically strict hierarchy of those organizations. The Texas Department of Public Safety classifies Tango Blast as a \\"loose affiliation\\" gang, with \\"relaxed membership requirements and little to no detectable leadership hierarchy.\\" The El Paso County sheriff's officials have noted that \\"there is no known formal organization of the gang on El Paso streets.\\" While those more structured organizations, known as Security Threat Groups, will have a variety of structures, Tango members in a particular area of a correctional facility will elect a silla (Spanish for \\"chair\\"), to speak for that area of the facility and will not have a constitution that governs how the members must behave. Tango Blast members do not have to follow orders, attend organizational meetings or pay other Tango members to be active. They also do not have to participate in any gang activities when they are out of prison. There is no consistent pathway for initiation into a Tango. Rather, each individual set of Tango members determines who it admits and by what methods. One initiation method is called a \\"Cora Check\\" or a test of heart in which the potential member must engage in physical combat with 2 or more members. Provided that he does not surrender during the melee he is inducted to the gang. However, membership can usually only be acquired in prison and not in jails or on the streets.  Individual Tangos  While it is commonly believed that there are only four chapters to the gang, other regions of the state have their own Tangos. Collectively, the tangos from Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston are known as the 4 Horsemen. Individual Tango members use regionally appropriate symbols as tattoos to identify the tango to which they belong. Generally, Tango members identify themselves by sport team logos or area codes from their home town or region. Houstone or H-Town members, who are from Houston, often use the Houston Astros & Cracked Houston Texan Symbol star. D-Town members, who are from Dallas, may use the Dallas Cowboys star, Foritos or F-Town members, who are also known as Foros and are from Fort Worth, often use the 817 area code, a star with 817 in the center similar to a pentagram. ATX or A-Town or La Capirucha (meaning The Capital) members, who are from Austin, may use the Texas Capitol building. These four Tangos represent the earliest Tangos to form. Other areas of Texas have their own Tangos, notably West Texas (Puro West or Wesos, often displaying 806 or 432, 23-20, the word West, or a WT in tattoos), the Valley (Vallucos), San Antonio (Orejones), Corpus Christi (Charcos) and El Paso (Chucos or EPT).

Before the Soviet era, which began in Central Asia in the early 1920s, the area designated today as the Republic of Tajikistan underwent a series of population changes that brought with them political and cultural influences from the Turkic and Mongol peoples of the Eurasian steppe, China, Iran, Russia, and other contiguous regions. The Tajik people came fully under Russian rule after a series of military campaigns that began in the 1860s, at the end of the nineteenth century. Ethnic background Iranian peoples, including ancestors of the modern Tajiks, have inhabited Central Asia since at least the earliest recorded history of the region, which began some 2,500 years ago. Contemporary Tajiks are the descendants of ancient Eastern Iranian inhabitants of Central Asia, in particular the Soghdians, Xorasmians and the Bactrians, and possibly other groups, with an admixture of Western Iranian Persians (see Glossary) and non-Iranian peoples. The ethnic contribution of various Turkic and Mongol peoples, who entered Central Asia at later times, has not been determined precisely. However, experts assume that some assimilation must have occurred in both directions.Curtis (1996). \\"Tajikistan: Historical Background\\". The origin of the name Tajik has been embroiled in twentieth-century political disputes about whether Turkic or Iranian peoples were the original inhabitants of Central Asia. The explanation most favored by scholars is that the word evolved from the name of a pre-Islamic (before the seventh century A.D.) Arab tribe. Until the 20th century, people in the region used two types of distinction to identify themselves: way of life‚Äîeither nomadic or sedentary‚Äîand place of residence. By the late nineteenth century, the Tajik and Uzbek peoples, who had lived in proximity for centuries and often used each other's languages, did not perceive themselves as two distinct nationalities. Consequently, such labels were imposed artificially when Central Asia was divided into five Soviet republics in the 1920s.

In contrast to most of Rubik's puzzles, Rubik's 360 is a physical challenge requiring manual dexterity, rather than learning of algorithms. The puzzle involves moving of six balls, each a different color, from a central sphere to six color-coded compartments in the outer sphere. This is done by maneuvering them through a middle sphere that only has two holes. There are three spheres that make up the puzzle. Like Rubik's Cube, Rubik's 360 has only one solution, but it cannot be solved by being broken apart.

The continuation resulted in two more unsuccessful artillery duels and the expedition ended for good on April 5.Yazoo Pass Expedition During the expedition Quinby became ill and took a leave of absence and General Marcellus M. Crocker assumed command of the 7th Division. Having recovered, Quinby returned to duty on the morning of May 16 but it was deemed necessary for General Crocker to retain command of the division as they were deploying for Battle at Champion Hill.

Released on 21 October, the album includes the singles \\"Goodnight\\", \\"Candy Girl\\", \\"You're Gorgeous\\" and \\"Cornershop\\". \\"You're Gorgeous\\" was a surprise top-three UK and international hit for the group. The album was written entirely by band-leader Stephen Jones. Many of the songs were written and recorded by Jones alone between 1988 and 1994. Several of the songs had been released in these demo incarnations on Jones' solo lo-fi work as Baby Bird that he did prior to forming the band with John Pedder, Robert Gregory, Luke Scott and Huw Chadbourn. The majority of the album was produced by Jones with Steve Power. Darren Allison and Ian Caple each produced a song. Release and reception Ugly Beautiful received generally positive reviews. The Independent wrote, \\"It's not just that the songs sound less like dashed- off demos - there is also an increased depth of musical character to them, which renders them more like collective notions rather than the mad imaginings of a marginalised loner\\". The album was released on CD, Cassette and double- LP. US editions differ from international versions with \\"King Bing\\" substituted for \\"CFC\\". The album charted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart, number fifteen on the New Zealand Album Chart, and was certified Gold by the BPI.

Bred in New South Wales, he was by the 'superbly-bred'The long and winding Roads Whiskey Road (Nijinsky-Bowl of Flowers) out of Giftisa (by Rich Gift - a grandson of Nasrullah and Abernant). Racing career=In Australia Trained by Doug Bougoure, Strawberry Road had two starts late in his two-year-old season before making a winning start to the new season on 11 August 1982, in the Queensland Maiden Handicap at Eagle Farm. Following a spell, he progressed from an Improvers to a Graduation with four wins in a row. Taken to Sydney, and stepped up to stakes company, he finished second to Marscay (the previous year's Golden Slipper winner) in the Hobartville Stakes, and, after two further lead-up runs, recorded his first Group One wins in the Rosehill Guineas and the AJC Derby. Back in Queensland, following a brief let- up, Strawberry Road won three of his four starts, including the Queensland Derby. After recording 10 wins for the season, including three in Group One races, Strawberry Road was named Australia's champion racehorse for the 1982‚Äì1983 season. In the spring, Strawberry Road campaigned in Melbourne, and, interspersed with defeats at Caulfield, won the Freeway Stakes, the Centennial Stakes, and the Cox Plate. In the autumn, Strawberry Road failed to find his best form, and, after 26 starts in Australia, which produced 13 wins, three seconds, and three-thirds,Strawberry Road's racing career (in Australia only) a controlling interest was sold to Ray Stehr and John Singleton, who exported him to France.ASB Strawberry Road Retrieved on 6 June 2009 (Note: Date of export to France is not correct and did not occur until 1984) International Campaigns Trained by John Nicholls, Strawberry Road won the Grosser Preis von Baden in Germany in 1984. He then finished fifth in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in France, third and fourth, respectively, in the Washington, D.C. International Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Turf in the United States, and closed the year with a seventh in the Japan Cup, ridden by the great English jockey Lester Piggott. Strawberry Road returned to France in 1985, and, under new trainer Patrick Biancone, won the Prix d'Harcourt. He was then sold to prominent French horseman Daniel Wildenstein, for whom he won the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Wildenstein then sent Strawberry Road to the United States, where he ran second to the champion Pebbles, by a neck, in the Breeders' Cup Turf. Sold to Allen Paulson and Bruce McNall, Strawberry Road remained in the United States, and was trained by Hall of Fame trainer Charlie Whittingham. Now seven, Strawberry Road recorded the last feature win of his career in the Arcadia Handicap at California's Santa Anita Park in 1986. At Stud Retired to stud by Paulson (now his sole owner), at his Brookside Farm in Versailles, Kentucky, Strawberry Road was a highly successful sire. His 368 progeny included 233 winners, and among the most successful were: * Dinard (b. 1988) - Won 1991 Santa Anita Derby, San Rafael Stakes * Fraise (b. 1988) - Won the 1992 Breeders' Cup Turf * Escena (b. 1993) - Won 1998 Breeders' Cup Distaff * Ajina (b. 1994) - Won 1997 Breeders' Cup Distaff Strawberry Road is also the damsire of: * Vindication (b. 2000) - The 2002 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt and winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile * Affluent (b. 1998) - Winner of four American Grade One races and prize money of more than US$1.4 million In 1995, Strawberry Road contracted a bacterial infection that led to peritonitis and pneumonia.

The front of the old building may be seen to the right, while St Luke's Church is behind to the left. Cradley Heath Baptist Church, also known as Four-ways Baptist Church, was the first Church of any denomination to build a chapel in Cradley Heath, West Midlands.Rev. Idris Williams, A History of the Four Ways Baptist Church, Cradley Heath, Staffs. Centenary Souvenir, 1933. The first meeting was in December 1833, in Grainger's Lane. Later, land was bought near the Four-Ways end of the High Street, and a meeting place was built. The site was expanded, and two further buildings were built, the last in 1904. This is now a Grade 2 Listed Building. The church is noted for appointing Britain's first recorded black West Indian pastor, Rev. George Cosens (or Cousens), in 1837. Origins Church Book showing signatures of the first members, on Sunday 23 December 1833, according to Baptist practice of a covenant to uphold the constitution and practice of the church as written on the preceding pages. left Cradley Heath Baptist Church began as an offshoot of Cradley Baptist Church in 1833. The Minister, Rev. Jabez Tunnicliff, read a verse from the Bible which challenged his theology. He paused so long in his sermon that some of the officers thought he was ill. He continued the sermon, but began Bible study which led him to part, amicably, with Cradley Baptist Church. A total of 34 others (though one returned) left with him that year. In December 1833 they began to meet and formed a new Church. Other people, from Cradley Heath, joined them at such a rate that in 1834 they had to build a substantial chapel. This first building was enlarged in 1850 by adding a gallery on the ground within the iron railings fence shown in the sketch of the first building. This is the side entrance as shown on the right hand side of the photograph. Deacons Of the original 4 deacons, church officers responsible for practical administration, two deserve mention. Benjamin Fellows also served as a lay preacher, and performed baptisms. This is usually done by the Minister, but Mr Fellows officiated at two baptism services during 1838 when George Cosens was the minister. This may have been for practical reasons. Until a baptistry inside the building had been provided, baptisms were often carried out in \\"the cut\\" - a branch of a local canal. Samuel Hallam, with his wife Ann, were not local to Cradley Heath. They were milliners, and had shops in Stourbridge, then Dudley, and finally in Birmingham before emigrating to Canada. Samuel came from Cromford, Ann from Sheffield, and they married in Tamworth.\\"The Family of Samuel Hallam\\" by Nickie Johnson, a descendant of Samuel Hallam Jabez Tunnicliff's wife, Mary, was in the same trade, and probably worked in the Hallam's shop. Before joining the new Cradley Heath Baptist Church, Samuel had been a Deacon in the Baptist Church in Stourbridge. He served as secretary and treasurer in the Sunday School until 1841.Idris Williams, centenary history book. Particular and General Baptists An explanation is needed of the doctrinal issue which led Tunnicliff to leave Cradley Baptist Church. British Baptists form two main groups according to one specific point of Protestant doctrine. This concerns Calvinism, which teaches that the work of Christ was not for everyone, but only for a few, the elect. The theological term here is Particular Atonement. Related to this is a concept that the elect are \\"born-again\\" by a work of God, which John Calvin thought to have happened to him when he was baptised as a baby by an Augustinian monk.Dave Hunt, What Love Is This, revised 2006, , 590pp. This includes a comprehensive account of the history and teaching of Calvinism, reviewed by leading calvinist theologians before publication and amended with their comments. This enables them to believe when they hear the gospel. Related to this is another concept, \\"Irresistible Grace\\", which teaches that the elect cannot resist the call of God, and that the non-elect cannot respond to it.Gadsby's Hymns, which could have been a hymn book used by Tunnicliff, includes many on the topic of election. The General Baptists follow Arminian theology, in that the work of Christ was for all, but not everyone believes and benefits from it. Being born again is a work of God which follows believing in Jesus Christ. But believing is not something one can do unaided. Conversion begins with a work of God to call, and to awaken to hear the call, and to give the faith with which one believes. But in contrast to Calvinism, the call of God is not irresistible, but people still have the freedom to refuse.John Wesley's sermons provide a comprehensive account of English Arminian theology. In many respects, however, as expressions of Protestant thinking in the 16th century, Arminianism and Calvinism have much in common and are like brothers from the same family. The challenge to Tunnicliff's theology began with a challenge to the determinism implied by Irresistible Grace. This led to his finding from Bible study that he considered that the General Baptist doctrines were right, and that he could no longer, with good conscience, continue to be salaried by a Particular Baptist congregation. History Rev. George Cosens in 1876 Although the Baptists were first to build a chapel in Cradley Heath, Primitive Methodists met in homes and workshops, from about 1820, but did not build until 1841. Some headlines in the history of Cradley Heath Baptist Church relate to the Ministers and others involved there. Rev. George Cosens, first black minister Cradley Heath Baptist Church is notable for having had the first Afro-Caribbean Minister in the Black Country, said to be the first known in Britain.Baptist Union of Great Britain Baptist History page (accessed 03/02/2009) In 1837, Rev. George Cosens was called to be minister. He was very popular, and served in various other churches in the area. His first time there was from 1837 to 1839. But he later served at Cradley Heath Baptist Church from 1869 to 1879.Baptist Historical Society, Newsletter November 2006, p.3 (follow link from this page) (accessed 03/02/2009) His second term was very successful at first, but later the health problems of old age were such that he was to be asked to resign. A meeting of the Deacons of the Church held on 2 June 1879 accepted his resignation.Minutes recorded in \\"The Secretary's Book\\" of Cradley Heath Baptist Church for 1877 to 1889. He moved to a less onerous pastorate at Brierley Hill. Born in 18051881 Census He was said to have come from Jamaica to study in a London college. In 1823, he was converted to Christianity while he and another student spent some free time in a church. He was disowned by his family, but clung to his Christian faith. He never returned to his native Jamaica, but served various churches as their pastor. His first church activity was with the Primitive Methodists from 1824.W. Leary, Directory of Primitive Methodist Ministers and their Circuits, 1990, p. 50 In May 1830 he married Mary Burnett, who died in June 1831Primitive Methodist Magazine 1832 In 1832, he was sent by the Sunderland Circuit to the Norman Isles.

This has been identified as in the yard of Heath Cottage, Grainger's Lane.Williams, op. cit., p. 12 In September 1834, they bought a piece of ground in the \\"Quarry Piece\\", Cradley Heath. The first building was erected in December 1834, \\"a fine new chapel seated for about 300\\".Williams, op. cit., p. 13 It was on the site of most of the present schoolroom. The gallery was added later. This extension is at the right-hand side of the above photograph. Neighbouring St Luke's Church was built in 1847. The present main building was opened in December 1904. It is a substantial brick building with a spire and ornaments both inside and outside. A two- manual plus pedals pipe organ adorns one side. The original chapel now serves as the schoolroom and hall. At various times in cold winters, the congregation have returned to the old building. In the 1987, Sandwell Council made it a Grade II Listed Building, as being a significant landmark.Date of Listing 29 September 1987.

As well as the Sunday morning meeting, Cradley Heath Baptist Church is involved in providing for the needs of people in local nursing homes who cannot get to a place of worship. There is also a short open-air meeting for hymn singing on some Saturdays, sometimes in the market, or on other open spaces just before Christmas. Toy collection donated to Mrs Anna Hartland of local charity Loaves 'N' Fishes Community activities include a \\"Toddlers Group\\" on Friday mornings, and a gardening club on the first Thursday evening of the month. The Cradley Heath Flower & Gardening Club was originally planned for the summer of 2009, but is so popular that it continues to meet during the winter. On 5 November 2009, the Special Demonstrator at the Club's Open Evening was Andrew Lloyd, Florist from Stourbridge. He is the NAFAS Area Chairman for Three Counties & South Wales and has been in the Floristry Business for 27 years. He presented 'A Floral Sparkler' and it was a sell-out event, with an audience of nearly 90 people. The Christmas activities in December 2009 included a \\"Christmas Spectacular\\" concert featuring children from nearby Springfield Primary School and a special guest appearance from international rising star Charlie Green, a semi- finalist on \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" in 2008. 250 tickets were sold to raise funds for urgent repairs to this listed building. The Church is involved in an annual Christmas toy collection. In 2010, this was donated to local charity Loaves 'N' Fishes to provide toys to needy children. The collection was boosted by the generosity of the people of Cradley Heath through the local Tesco's supermarket which kindly provided a collection point. During the winter of 2009-2010, the church building suffered from thieves taking lead from the roof. This was at about the same time as lead was taken, twice, from the roof of the nearby public library building, and from a number of private houses. The church building suffered from significant amounts of water leaking in. The pipe organ alone required repairs estimated at about ¬£4,000Report to Church Meeting in March 2010. During the first quarter of 2011, a disabled standard toilet was built in the Choir Vestry, as part of upgrading the building to 21st century standards. Being a listed building, the construction had to be such that the original building features were not damaged. A grant application to English Heritage was made during 2010. The building was judged to be of sufficient historical interest that a grant of ¬£106,000 was awarded in March 2011, leaving an estimated ¬£60,000 to be found to cover major building repairs including dry rot damage and the first replacement roof on the original 19th century building. The first phase of general renovation took place during the first 6 months of 2013. This repaired the front (west end) and north side of the 1904 building, including replacement of ornamental terra-cotta features, and the floor on the north side.

E. Raven, was an English classical scholar, notable for his work on presocratic philosophy, and amateur botanist. Early life and education John Raven was born on 13 December 1914 in Cambridge,Catalogus Philologorum Classicorum the son of Charles Earle Raven, sometime Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge and Master of Christ's College, Cambridge and of Margaret Wollaston. His mother's family endowed Raven with a distinguished intellectual pedigree, including between 1723 and 1829 seven Fellows of the Royal Society (among them Charlton Wollaston, Francis Wollaston (1694-1774), Francis Wollaston (1762-1823), George Wollaston and William Hyde Wollaston); Raven was also a 7th generation descendant of William Wollaston, the philosophical writer. On his father's side, he was related to Samuel Hole, Dean of Rochester.Raven, Chapter 1 Raven was educated at St Ronan's School, then situated at Worthing, before proceeding in September 1928 with a scholarship to Marlborough College, where he distinguished himself academically, winning prizes in English verse, Greek iambics, Greek and Latin prose and Latin verse, culminating in a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. He did not confine himself to the intellectual, playing in the First XV at rugby and setting new school records in 1934 for the high jump and 440 yards.Raven, Op. cit., Chapter 2 Following the award of a first class degree in classics at TrinityA Rum Affair: How Botany's \\"Piltdown Man\\" was Unmasked by Karl Sabbagh, The Penguin Press 1999, Raven became in 1946 a research fellow there.

Preston, Watsonia; 25: 17‚Äì44 (2004) a position he held until his retirement in 1984. During the Second World War he was a conscientious objector,Obituary of Andrew Raven, The Daily Telegraph; 5 October 2005 basing his case on arguments by Plato. He undertook unsalaried social work for Guy Clutton-Brock at Oxford House in Bethnal Green.King's College Archive: Papers relating to John Earle Raven Classical scholar As a classical scholar, Raven's interests were in ancient philosophy. In 1957 he published with Geoffrey Kirk The Pre-Socratic philosophers, a standard work for undergraduates still in use today. Raven contributed the chapters relating to the Italian tradition (Pythagoras of Samos, Alcmaeon of Croton, Pre- Parmenidean Pythagoreanism, Parmenides of Elea, Zeno of Elea, Melissus of Samos, Philolaus of Croton and Eurytus of Croton) and on Anaxagoras and Archelaus. As Senior Tutor at King's in the 1960s he turned the college to the left, telling public schools that their boys could no longer expect to \\"swan in\\", as previously. Raven was the undergraduate tutor of Myles Burnyeat, who subsequently became the fifth Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy at Cambridge University.Book review by M.F. Burnyeat, London Review of Books, 22 February 2007 Botanist: The Heslop-Harrison fraud While Raven's principal professional occupation was his career as a classical scholar, he applied a similar intellectual rigour to his amateur interest in botany. From the mid-1930s John Heslop-Harrison, Professor of Botany at King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne, had reported significant new plant discoveries on expeditions to the Inner and Outer Hebrides. The sheer scale of the discoveries aroused scepticism, and in 1948 Raven secured a grant from Trinity College to fund a trip to Harris and R√πm in July and August of that year to investigate the claims of Heslop-Harrison. Raven's conclusions about two of the notable species were published, briefly, in Nature. He suggested that both Carex bicolor and Polycarpon tetraphyllum were introductions to R√πm, but did not comment on the possible means of introduction. His full report of the expedition and fraud was deposited in the library of King's College, Cambridge on 5 May 1960, to attack Prof. Jack Heslop-Harrison's electron microscope research into plant genetics (DNA) and only published in full in 1999 after the deaths of both Heslop-Harrison, his son Jack Heslop-Harrison and Raven himself. In the report Raven alleged that at some time in the 1940s Heslop Harrison transported alien plants to the Isle of Rum and planted them in the soil; he then \\"discovered\\" the plants, claimed they were indigenous to the area and that he was the first to find them. Raven's report to the council of Trinity College states: \\"In the interests not only of truth but also of the reputation of British science it is essential somehow to discover what plants and what insects he (Heslop Harrison) has either completely fabricated or else deliberately introduced into the Hebrides.\\" Raven's classical and botanical interests were brought together in four J. H. Gray Lectures given at Cambridge in 1976, published after his death as Plants and Plant Lore in Ancient Greece.Review by John M.

The cabinet contained an archive of 695 files documenting war crimes perpetrated on Italian soil under fascist rule and during Nazi occupation after the September 8, 1943 armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces. The actions described in the records spanned several years and took place in various areas of the country, from the southern city of Acerra to the northern province of Trieste and as far east as the Balkans; it remains unclear, to this day, how the archive remained concealed for so long, and who gave the order to hide the files in the immediate post-war period. Discovery In 1994, military prosecutor Antonino Intelisano, who was at the time in charge of the trial against former SS officer Erich Priebke, accidentally uncovered the content of the wooden cabinet, which had remained stored for decades, face to the wall, in an unused room in Palazzo Cesi. Its contents had seemingly been placed in the armoire temporarily, probably in the immediate post-war months, and forgotten or (perhaps purposely) overlooked. The armoire contained the memorandum titled Atrocities in Italy, stamped \\"secret\\", which had been compiled by the British Secret Intelligence Service, whose officers had documented the victims' accusations and painstakingly collected depositions, and consigned it to the Italian magistrates, who failed to prosecute the individuals mentioned in the files, limiting publication of details and accusations to the cases against unnamed Nazi and fascist officers.

A French army of 12,000 attacked a Hessian corps of 10,000 that was besieging the town, forcing them to retreat with heavy losses. Philippe d'Orl√©ans, French commander in Italy. Background By the end of 1705, France and its allies controlled most of Northern Italy, as well as the Savoyard territories of Villefranche and the County of Savoy, now in modern-day France. The Imperial army in Italy was substantially reinforced, the Maritime Powers paying for another 20,000 German auxiliaries, including 10,000 Hessians and renewing an existing agreement with Prussia. The main French objective for 1706 was to capture the Savoyard capital of Turin; to prevent Imperial forces in Lombardy intervening, Vend√¥me attacked at Calcinato on 19 April and drove them into the Trentino valley. On 12 May, Marshall La Feuillade and an army of 48,000 men reached Turin, completing their blockade of the city on 19 June. The Imperial commander Prince Eugene returned from Vienna and took the remaining troops into the Province of Verona to await the German contingents. By early July, there were 30,000 Imperial soldiers around Verona facing 40,000 French spread between the Mincio and Adige rivers. The French position looked very strong but defeat at Ramillies in May meant Vend√¥me and any available troops were sent to Northern France. The siege of Turin continued and although the Hessians had not yet arrived, by mid-July Prince Eugene could no longer delay marching to its relief. The new French commander in Italy, Louis XIV's nephew Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans followed him, leaving the Count of M√©davy and 23,000 men to guard the Alpine passes.  The battle  The Hessians finally crossed the Alps in July, under the command of Frederick of Hesse- Kassel. He later became King of Sweden but was a far less talented soldier than his brother-in-law and predecessor Charles XII. As they arrived too late to join Prince Eugene's march to Turin, the Hessians were tasked with preventing M√©davy disrupting his supply routes. On 19 August, Frederick sent 2,000 men under Major-General Wetzel to Goito, a small town with a bridge across the Mincio and the French garrison evacuated the town. Castiglione was strongly defended and they had to wait for the heavy artillery to arrive from Arco. Frederick left 1,500 men outside the town with the rest positioned near Medole, allowing him to monitor M√©davy's main force at Cremona and the crossing at Goito. The withdrawal from Goito was part of a plan by M√©davy to assemble a field army without alerting Frederick by removing garrisons from key strongpoints like Cremona. He put together a force of 8,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, crossed the Oglio River at Marcaria and attacked around 14:00 on 8 September. Dividing his corps left Frederick outnumbered; the first assaults were repulsed but a cavalry charge led by the Irish exile Arthur Dillon caught the Hessian left wing as they were changing position and the line collapsed. M√©davy then turned his attention to those outside Castiglione, many of whom surrendered; French casualties were estimated as 1,000 killed or wounded, the Hessians losing around 1,500 killed or wounded plus 2,500 captured. The remainder fell back on Valeggio; in a letter of 11 September to Marlborough, Frederick claimed his forces were reduced by sickness but although they initially drove the French back, lack of artillery forced him to retreat.  Aftermath  M√©davy's victory left the strategic position unaltered; the Battle of Turin on 7 September had broken the siege and after Ramillies France could no longer spare the resources to continue fighting in Italy. Castiglione slightly improved their bargaining position but French garrisons in Lombardy were isolated and could not be reinforced, their surrender being only a matter of time. To the fury of the English and Dutch, in March 1707 Emperor Joseph signed the Convention of Milan withdrawing all French troops from Northern Italy in return for free passage back to France. In return, Joseph regained the Duchy of Milan, considered vital to the security of Austria's southern borders and spared the expense of reducing the French garrisons one by one. He agreed to support the Anglo-Dutch proposal to capture the French base at Toulon; this would confirm Allied naval supremacy in the Western Mediterranean, support the Camisard revolt and enable Victor Amadeus to regain his Trans-Alpine possessions of Villefranche and the County of Savoy. However, at the last minute Joseph ordered Count Wirich Philipp von Daun to take 8,000 troops allocated for this campaign and capture the Spanish possession of Naples. This was complete by the end of September and the fighting in Italy ceased.

Accessed online 11 February 2009.) was a newspaper reporter and activist from Seattle, Washington.Eric Scigliano, \\"What a Hoot!\\", Seattle Metropolitan, December 2008, p. 52-54.Ross Reider, Pettus, Terry (1904-1984), HistoryLink, September 27, 2000. Accessed online 2 February 2009. Background Meredith Burrus Terry Pettus was born on August 15, 1904, in Terre Haute, Indiana. His father was a Christian Socialist. Career Pettus worked briefly as a reporter in Minneapolis and in Grand Forks, North Dakota, before moving to Seattle with his wife Berta in 1927. Shortly after arrival in Seattle, they lodged with artist Kenneth Callahan; Pettus went to work for the Seattle Star. In 1935, as a reporter for the Tacoma Tribune he became Washington State's first member of the American Newspaper Guild. In February 1936 he was asked by the Guild to organize its Seattle chapter. By the end of the year, this had led to the first successful strike to gain union recognition for workers at a Hearst newspaper (the Seattle Post-Intelligencer). (David Selvin of the Pacific Coast Labor Bureau also played a key role in these events.) The Tacoma Tribune closed its doors shortly thereafter. Pettus worked for a time in South Bend, Washington, editing the Willapa Harbor Pilot and becoming involved with the left-wing Washington Commonwealth Federation, initially in a drive for public power. Increasingly radicalized by the Great Depression, in 1938 Pettus joined the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). He became editor of the Commonwealth Federation's Washington New Dealer (from 1943 New World). When he tried to enlist to serve in World War II, he was rejected because this work was considered essential to the war effort. In 1946, Pettus ran unsuccessfully for Seattle City Council, finishing last in a field of six contending for three seats.General and Special Elections: Results for Elected Officials, City of Seattle. Accessed online 2 February 2009. On January 27, 1948, Pettus disrupted the first witness of Canwell Committee hearings into Communist infiltration in the State of Washington. The witness was Louis F. Budenz, managing editor of the Communist Party's official organ, the Daily Worker. In that role, Budenz claimed to have heard of Pettus and to know of his newspaper the New World (previously the Washington New Dealer). As soon as Budenz started talking about Communist newspapers in Seattle, Pettus tried to interrupt him. When Budenz stated \\"The New World is absolutely controlled by the political committee of the Communist Party,\\" Terry Pettus finally made it onto the hearing's transcript, stating, \\"That is a lie, as the editor of that paper--\\" Budenz also said that Jack Stachel had told him about Pettus, editor and comrade. In February 1948, Pettus was named as a member of the Communist Party by former head of the Washington Commonwealth Federation Howard Costigan in testimony before the Canwell Committee of the Washington State Legislature.Albert F. Canwell, et al., First Report, Un-American Activities in Washington State, 1948: Report of Joint Fact Finding Committee on Un-American Activities: Established by the Thirtieth Legislature under House Concurrent Resolution No. 10. Olympia, WA: The House, n.d. [1948]; pg. 367. Blacklisted in the McCarthy Era at the start of the Cold War, Pettus became editor of the People's World, a newspaper associated with the CPUSA. He was charged in 1952 with conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government, and convicted and sentenced to five years, plus an additional three on contempt charges for refusing to name names. He only actually ever served 60 days, and his conviction was eventually overturned by the United States Supreme Court. Pettus left the CPUSA in 1958. Back in Seattle, Pettus moved onto a houseboat in 1958 and later played a crucial role in saving Lake Union's houseboats and in preventing the city from dumping sewage directly into the lake. Legacy Pete Seeger (here, in 1955) may have learned the term \\"hootenanny\\" from Pettus when he and Woody Guthrie passed through Seattle in the late 1930s In the late 1930s, in Seattle, Pettus edited the Commonwealth Federation's newspaper and hosted the Seattle-area hootenannies (or \\"hoots\\"), which Eric Scigliano describes as \\"fundraising, consciousness-raising, and hellraising parties\\" for the federation. Pettus had originally learned the word in Terre Haute, where it meant \\"a party that just sort of happens\\" without prior planning and brought it to Seattle. When Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger passed through Seattle, they performed at the hoots; it is believed that they picked up the term hootenanny there, and passed it into the broader American vocabulary. Terry Pettus Park Seattle mayor Charles Royer honored him in 1982 with an official Terry Pettus Day, and in 1985, the year after his death, the city dedicated the small Terry Pettus Park on the shore of Lake Union near one of the houseboat neighborhoods.

He lived with the Harpers till the age of 9 and being brought up in an English family, spoke fluent English. Academic career He achieved first place in the 11+ exam in Egypt and later joined Medical School, qualifying from Qasr el Eini in 1904. Dr Sobhi became an Anatomist and wrote several papers in this field. In 1909 he came to London, but returned to Cairo two years later to look after his family following the sudden death of his father. Between 1940 and 1952 he was Professor of General Medicine in Qasr el Eini. He qualified MRCP and later FRCP. He was also Prof. of Egyptology at the faculty of art at Fouad Ist university. He pioneered asthma treatment treating it with gold injections, a breakthrough in his day. He loved the history of medicine and wrote extensively on the subject and later became Professor of the History of Medicine. He learned the Coptic language almost by accident. Mahdist War in Sudan obliged the Coptic Bishop there to flee to Egypt where he met Dr Sobhi and taught him Coptic. He became a scholar in the language, so much so that Saad Zaghloul, the national Egyptian leader, asked him to write a manuscript on the language and it was printed at the government's expense in Arabic and in English. Dr Sobhi came across a rare old Coptic text on proverbs. He transcribed the book in one night and returned it to his owner. He was able to translate and publish the book later. He studied hieroglyphics, and became fluent in it. He taught demotic in the school of Egyptian Antiquities. He wrote the only book of its kind, Arabic words of Coptic and Greek origin. He was fluent in seven languages: English, French, Italian, Arabic, Greek, Latin and Coptic; he could also read hieroglyphics. He learnt Italian while looking after the Italian prisoners of war during the First World War. He was married to a French lady, and had no children; he was survived by a wealth of scientific and humanistic studies.

Sykes was born at Cringle House Cheadle, the second son of Thomas Hardcastle Sykes of the Sykes Bleaching Company and his wife Mary Platt daughter of John Platt MP for Oldham. He was known as Jack. He was left motherless in 1875, and in 1881 went away to Rugby School, following his brothers and cousins. He then went to Oriel College, Oxford and while at Oxford joined the Freemasons, to which he remained deeply committed in his adult life.The Abridged History of Humphrey Chetham Lodge No 645 He entered the family bleaching company at the age of 23 and worked his way through the various departments of the bleachworks before becoming manager. Sykes played cricket for Cheshire Gentlemen and hunted with the Cheshire hounds. He became a Justice of the Peace in 1897 and was active in the 3rd Volunteer Battalion, Cheshire Regiment until 1904. After his father died in 1901, he took on a number of local civic positions in Stockport, becoming treasurer of the Infirmary and a Governor of the Grammar School. Sykes was interested in agriculture, running Edgeley Home Farm and the family's estates in Canada of in Saskatchewan. He travelled extensively in his early years to America and Canada, and also to South Africa, Egypt, India and Russia and was an early enthusiast for motoring and flying. In 1907 Sykes was adopted as the Conservative candidate for Knutsford and a year later gave up the management of the Edgeley Bleachworks, while remaining director of the Bleachers' Association. In April 1910, he was appointed deputy lieutenant of Cheshire, and from 1910 to 1911 he was mayor of Stockport, the fourth generation of the family to hold this office. Before and after the first world war, Sykes was a leading Conservative organizer in the North West, chairing the Lancashire and Cheshire Federation of Junior Unionist organization. In January 1910, as a keen Tariff Reformer, he was elected MP for Knutsford, taking control from the Liberal. Unsatisfied with the political support he was receiving from the local press, in 1912 he gained control of the Stockport Advertiser Group, which was in fact owned by Swain & Co under the direction of an uncle. In parliament he kept up persistent questioning in support of local interests, and was a leading member of a group of MPs critical of the Government's neglect of Territorial Army and the Volunteer Forces before and during the First World War. In 1916 he served the Government as commissioner reviewing permits for aliens. At the beginning of World War I he returned to command the local volunteers as lieutenant-colonel of the reformed 6th Battalion, the Cheshire Regiment TF. He was unfit for active service in 1914 but served as secretary to the County Committee of the Cheshire Volunteer Regiment and Staff commandant from 1916 until the force's disbandment in 1920. He was awarded a baronetcy in June 1917. Sykes resigned as an MP in 1922 but continued to be active in local party organizations. He was chairman of the Cheshire division of the National Union from 1913, of the Lancashire and Cheshire Division of the Conservative Association from 1930 to 1932, of the North West Provincial Association from 1933 to 1947, and of Knutsford Conservative Association 1922‚Äì1946. After retiring as an MP, he became involved in the bleaching business again. Outside the Bleacher's Association, Sykes held, mostly by inheritance, a number of directorships, of which the principal one was of Williams Deacons Bank held between 1918 and 1948. Others were land holding companies and Swain & Co the newspaper group. He was Chairman of the governors of Stockport Grammar School from 1921 to 1950, Chairman of the Stockport Infirmary from 1918 to 1948, president of Manchester Northern Hospital from 1901 and chairman thereof from 1942 to 1950, chairman of the Ephraim Hallam Trust and president of the Oldham Blue Coat School. As early as 1923 he was noted as holding \\"more offices than he can remember\\"Manchester Guardian Commercial 17 May 1923 He was involved in the local government of Cheadle. For many years he was also president of the Lancashire and Cheshire Economic League and was an early supporter of the FBI and other business associations which the Bleachers' Association had helped to fund. In 1948, he succeeded the 17th Earl of Derby as Grand Superintendent of Lancashire (East Division) Provincial Grand Chapter of the Royal Arch Masons. He remained a confirmed bachelor, with plutocratic tastes - for example yellow Rolls Royces and annual gastronomic tours of France followed by taking the waters at Vichy.

This can take the form of whole stumps, logs, pieces of bark or even worked timber such as railway sleepers or floorboards. The pieces are arranged artistically and plants, typically ferns, mosses and lichens are encouraged to grow around or on them. They provide a feature for the garden and a habitat for several types of wildlife. The first stumpery was built in 1856 at Biddulph Grange and they remained popular in Victorian Britain. Stag Beetle stumpery at Aldershot in Hampshire A stumpery traditionally consists of tree stumps arranged upside- down or on their sides to show the root structure but logs, driftwood or large pieces of bark can also be used. The stumps can be used individually or attached together to form a structure such as a wall or arch. Stumperies can vary in size from a handful of logs to large displays containing dozens of full tree stumps. The use of storm-damaged or diseased trees is not uncommon and can save the landowner the cost of their removal. Where tree stumps are unavailable a more modern, angular look can be achieved by using railway sleepers or old oak floorboards and some companies sell waste timber or driftwood specifically for the purpose of constructing stumperies. Plants such as ferns, mosses and lichens are often encouraged to grow around and on the stumpery. Stumperies provide a home for wildlife and have been known to host stag beetles, toads and small mammals. Part of the stumpery at the Ch√¢teau de Chaumont, central France Stumperies have been described as \\"Victorian horticultural oddities\\" and were popular features of 19th-century gardens. The reasons for their popularity vary but it may be a result of the Romantic Movement which emphasised the beauty of nature. Their popularity may also be attributed to the increasing popularity of ferns as garden plants at the time. Ferns were very fashionable and hundreds of new species were introduced to Britain from around the world. The stumpery made an ideal habitat for these shade-loving plants. Additionally stumperies may have been used in place of rockeries in areas where suitable rocks were in short supply. Their popularity is once again on the rise. The first stumpery to be built, at Biddulph Grange, Staffordshire, in 1856, was designed by the artist and gardener Edward William Cooke for the estate's owner James Bateman. The stumpery at Biddulph Grange consists of stumps placed into a wall either side of a garden path and used as a scaffold for the growth of ferns. A famous modern stumpery is that at Highgrove House, Gloucestershire, the home of Prince Charles, which is considered to be the largest stumpery in Britain. The Prince built the stumpery from sweet chestnut roots, held in place by steel bars, when he first purchased the estate in 1980, and it now provides a home for organically grown ferns, hellebores and hostas. The largest stumpery in the United States is at Vashon Island in Washington. It rivals the Highgrove stumpery in size, measuring and including around 95 separate tree stumps. Stumperies can sometimes be mistaken for garden rubbish; indeed, when Prince Philip first saw his son's stumpery, he remarked: \\"When are you going to set fire to this lot?\\".

It has been used to prevent kidney stones. This compound is an ion-exchange resin that can not be absorbed by the body. However, it can be used to restore the normal intestinal calcium absorption. When it is taken orally, it binds strongly to calcium and inhibits its absorption into the blood. From there, inhibition is caused due to the lower intraluminal calcium levels, which is typically available for absorption. The mechanism of action of the drug compound can cause a couple of internal effects. Due to the binding activity of the compound with calcium, it will also bind with magnesium and cause a depletion in the body. Working off of this effect, sodium cellulose phosphate will bind with divalent intestinal cations. Because of this binding, more oxalate is available in the blood. This high level of oxalate within the intestine can also be a source of renal stones. Studies In the late 1970s and early 1980s, physiological action studies took place to show how intestinal calcium was absorbed and how it affects other functions within the body. By a study done at the University of Texas, it was found that sodium cellulose phosphate inhibited calcium absorption through three separate techniques. * Calcium balance studies * External counting method * Formal kinetic analysis Through these studies, major conclusions were made regarding the drug compound. Sodium cellulose phosphate reduces the renal excretion of magnesium and calcium. Phosphate and oxalate were both increased in the urine, one due to intestinal hydrolysis and the other to a reduced oxalate complex. Overall, it was noted that the drug could be used to correct the increased calcium absorption that occurs in absorptive hypercalciuria. Calcibind The major US dosage form of sodium cellulose phosphate is Calcibind, which was developed and brought to market by Mission Pharma. Calcibind is a powder dosage form, which comes in small, 2.5 gram doses, individually packaged. The patent for this product was approved on December 28, 1982. The product was eventually removed from the market for reasons that have not been found at this time. Hypercalcemia This condition occurs when there is a raised level of calcium in the blood, compared to the normal range of 2.2‚Äì2.6 mmol/L. Typical symptoms of this condition include renal stones, bone pain, abdominal discomfort, and nausea/vomiting. More severe symptoms are associated with psychiatric overtones which are consumed with anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Hypercalciuria Hypercalciuria occurs when there is an elevated level of calcium in the urine. This condition is due to severe calcium reabsorption within the intestines.

She fought during the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin as a sniper, among other roles, and was the only female wounded in the action. As a scout, she was praised for her bravery. Sadhbh Walsche in The New York Times refers to her as \\"the schoolteacher turned sniper\\".\\"The Sisterhood of the Easter Rising\\", The New York Times, 16 March 2016  Early life  Skinnider was born in 1893 to Irish parents in the Lanarkshire town of Coatbridge. She trained as a mathematics teacher and joined Cumann na mBan in Glasgow. She was also involved in the women's suffrage movement, including a protest at Perth Prison. Ironically, she had learned to shoot in a rifle club \\"Eight Women of the Easter Rising\\", The New York Times, 16 March 2016 which had originally been set up so that women could help in defence of the British Empire. During her trips to Ireland, Skinnider came under the influence of Constance Markievicz and became active in smuggling detonators and bomb-making equipment into Dublin (in her hat) in preparation for the 1916 Easter Rising. Along with Madeleine ffrench-Mullen, she spent time in the hills around Dublin testing dynamite. When Skinnider was shown \\"the poorest part of Dublin\\" by Markievicz, she wrote, \\"I do not believe there is a worse place in the world.\\" The street was \\"a hollow full of sewage and refuse\\", and the building \\"as full of holes as if it had been under shellfire\\".  Easter Rising  Margaret Skinnider disguised as a man Operating variously as a scout, message runner (often dressed as a boy) and sniper, Skinnider took part in action against the British Army at the Garrison at the College of Surgeons and St. Stephen's Green under the Command of General Michael Mallin and Markievicz. Skinnider was reportedly an excellent markswoman. She was seriously wounded when she was shot three times attempting to burn down houses on Harcourt Street to try to cut off the retreat of British soldiers who had planted a machine gun post on the roof of the University Church. Nora Connolly O'Brien describes Skinnider's leading role in this action: In her autobiography, Doing my bit for Ireland (New York ‚Äì Century, 1917,Skinnider herself vividly describes her role as a sniper at St. Stephen's Green in the Easter Rising: In terms of her role as a woman taking part in military action Skinnider comments: The former president of Sinn F√©in, Gerry Adams, quoted Skinnider's stirring words in his 2006 address to the Sinn F√©in Ard Feis.Gerry Adams MP Presidential Address Ard Fheis 2006, Injured in the battle, Skinnider spent several weeks in hospital before she contrived to escape whilst awaiting medical treatment and obtained a travel permit from Dublin Castle to enable her to return to Scotland.  Post-1916 activities  Skinnider returned to Dublin later that year before fleeing to the United States in fear of internment. While in America, she collected funds for the republican cause and lectured with other women who had fought in the Easter Rising. Skinnider also wrote and published her autobiography in New York ‚Äì Doing my Bit for Ireland. Skinnider later returned to Ireland and took up a teaching post in Dublin in 1917. Skinnider was perhaps a lesbian, and around 1919, she came to live with her partner Nora O‚ÄôKeeffe as a couple. During the Irish War of Independence, she was arrested and imprisoned. In the Irish Civil War, she became Paymaster General of the Irish Republican Army until she was arrested in 1923 and held at North Dublin Union. There she became Director of Training for the prisoners.  Later life  After her release from prison, she worked as a teacher at Kings Inn Street Sisters of Charity Primary School in Dublin until her retirement in 1961. She was a member of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) throughout her teaching career, and became its President in 1956. She also actively fought for the rights of women. She spent her last years in Glenageary, County Dublin. She died on 10 October 1971 and was buried next to Markievicz in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.

It follows a shorter film made by the same team in 1987, Kalle Stropp och Grodan Boll r√§ddar H√∂nan. This is the first time since before 1954 where a Kalle Stropp production features voice acting by others than only Funck himself, only with the exception of children that had participated in other productions as well. It was dubbed into English by Filmor and Cin√©lume in 1998 and was only released in Canada straight-to-video under the name Charlie and Froggy from Alliance Films. The majority of the characters' names were changed and four minutes of footage were removed.  Plot  Something strange has been spotted over the treetops in the forest where Charlie Strapp and Froggy Ball live, and Tin-Can Harry (Sheet-Niklas) quickly builds a Binoculars to examine it. It turns out to be an emergency signal and the two friends together with Tin-Can Harry (Sheet-Niklas) and Polly the Parrot (The Parrot) set out on an expedition to rescue whoever is sending the signal. While crossing a stream, though, Froggy Ball falls down a small waterfall and ends up in a dark Cave. While looking for a way out he stumbles upon the Isopoda people who live there and quickly befriends King Cone And Queen Cone. In the meantime Charlie Strapp has met up with Princess Cone Green, a young and impulsive female cone, and soon joins Froggy Ball and the others. It turns out that the Cone people are the ones who have been sending the signal, and when elevated up to a tree top Charlie Strapp and Froggy Ball see a helicopter landing, with three evil businessman from the company Tonto-Turbo who are planning to tear down a huge part of the forest. When the businessman leave, Connie ends up being with them on the helicopter. Charlie Strapp and Froggy Ball hang onto the landing skids, but eventually fall off high up in the air over a lake. Luckily it turns out that Charlie's tailcoat can be used as a parachute, and Froggy Ball even learns how to steer it by pulling the tails so they can land on a steam boat. On the boat Tin-Can Harry (Sheet-Niklas) and Polly succeed to locate them so they can join them again. The boat takes them to Gripsholm Castle, which turns out to be where the businessmen were heading too, as their full plan is to move the old castle to the cleared space in the forest and turn it into a hyper modern luxury hotel, replacing most of its walls and floors with glass. This will be made possible by hacking the authorities' computers with a special program they are keeping on a floppy disk. Connie, who has been hiding in a briefcase, tries to steal the disk but fails. Instead she, Charlie Strapp and Froggy Ball end up on the bottom of the castle well, but are soon rescued by Tin-Can Harry (Sheet-Niklas) who has the ability to fly. In the meantime the men from Tonto- Turbo leave again in their helicopter. Tin-Can Harry (Sheet-Niklas) calculates that they are heading to Ericsson Globe, before he flies back to the cone forest with Cone Green. In the city, Charlie Strapp and Froggy Ball walk up to Ericsson Globe and confront them, but are simply laughed at and disregarded. The businessmen then head off to the Nobel party where they have been invited. The two friends, left in the office, discover that the men forgot to bring the floppy disk with them. They try to find out which one of the disks at the office it is that is the real one, and while trying one in the computer the frog ends up inside of a computer game and Charlie has to control him into safety with the joystick. Soon after that, one of the men returns ‚Äì and takes the right disk with him. Unable to get into the Stockholm City Hall, Froggy Ball is ready to give up when a submarine appears. Out of it come Tin-Can Harry (Sheet-Niklas) and Connie who have returned. Through the kitchen they smuggle themselves into the party by hiding in the dessert ‚Äì an ice cream parade. When inside Froggy Ball holds a speech where he accuses the men from Tonto-Turbo in public. The atmosphere becomes confused, and the men capture the two friends and decide to get rid of them once and for all. But then suddenly Phil the Fox (The Fox), who had previously only been seen in a short cameo in the very beginning of the story, arrives and causes disruption. While the men are distracted everybody can escape, and Connie steals the floppy disk. After a wild chase through, the men recapture the disk, but only to see an army of cones arrive and chase them into the water, where also the disk is dropped by The Parrot. Back in the cone forest the frog is awarded a prize from the hands of the cone Minister of Flower Pots and the businessman are given a new profession ‚Äì shaving sheep which they seem to enjoy.

When listening to one of these Jan Gissberg got the idea of making an animated film about them and contacted Thomas Funck. Together they discussed the desirable appearances of the characters and settings. The project was to be produced by Gissberg's own recently started animation studio, Cinemation Industries, where also his brother Peter Gissberg worked as a background artist. Around Christmas 1987 a short film was released, but already a year prior to that, they had begun working on a script for a feature-length film. In 1987 they started the process of making it, using a budget of 13 million SEK.  Reception  The general Swedish reception was positive, with more or less a critical consensus claiming that it stood out as the winner among the films competing over a similar target audience, being released around the same time as Rock-A-Doodle, The Rescuers Down Under and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West. The playful style and rich ideas were complimented, and the poetic background art by Peter Gissberg was particularly praised. Dagens Nyheter claimed that although it might lack the virtuosity of Disney's films, it is to its credit that it also lacks their sentimentality and delight for violence. And further, that it is \\"pretty sophisticated when it allows the sportively drawn characters to appear against a backdrop of aquarelle soft nature poetry, signed by Peter Gissberg.\\"  Awards  * Director Jan Gissberg received a Guldbagge Award for Best Creative Achievement 1992 * Honorary Award in the section for children's and youth films at the Cannes Film Festival 1992  References  External links  * Swedish children's films Swedish animated films 1991 animated films 1991 films Films based on radio series ","title":"Charlie Strapp and Froggy Ball Flying High"},{"id":"21356042","text":"He won a medal at the 2016 European Canoe Sprint Championships Petre Condrat is a Romanian sprint canoer who competed in the early to mid-2000s.

Various countries observe such a holiday on various dates. International Migratory Bird Day International Migratory Bird Day poster 2014 International Migratory Bird Day is a conservation initiative that brings awareness on conserving migratory birds and their habitats throughout the Western Hemisphere. This program is dedicated to international conservation efforts and environmental education in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Originated by the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, it is now coordinated by Environment for the Americas.Environment for the Americas- home of International Migratory Bird Day. Website: birdday.org International Migratory Bird Day (IMBD) officially takes place on the second Saturday in May in the U.S. and Canada and on the second Saturday of October in Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean each year. Recognizing that this date does not work well for all places or for the migratory birds themselves- sites host these programs at their convenience throughout the year. This program engages the general public to care about maintaining healthy bird populations and protecting breeding, non-breeding, and stop over habitats used by migratory birds. International Migratory Bird Day programs often are informal science education or informal science learning activities such as bird walks, art competitions, nature based festivals, and presentations. These programs take place in a variety of settings such as zoos, aquariums, protected lands, biospheres, museums, and schools. Every year International Migratory Bird Day has a new conservation theme with corresponding artwork, educational materials, and activities. *2000: Focus on the Falcon, Artist Roger Tory Peterson *2001: Taste of the Tropics, Artist Terry Issac *2002: Exploring Habitats, Artist Charley Harper *2003: Catalysts for Conservation, Artist Gerald Sneed *2004: Conserving Colonial Birds, Artist Ram Papish *2005: Collisions, Artist David Sibley *2006: The Boreal Forest, Artist Radeaux *2007: Birds in a Changing Climate, Artist Louise Zemaitis *2008: Tundra to Tropics, Artist Eleazar Saenz *2009: Celebrate Birds In Culture, Artist Andy Everson *2010: Power of Partnerships, Artist Bob Petty *2011: Go Wild Go Birding, Artist John Muir Laws *2012: Connecting People to Bird Conservation, Artist Rafael Lopez *2013: Life Cycle of Migratory Birds, Artist Barry Kent MacKay *2014: Why Birds Matter, Artist Elias St. Louis *2015: Restore Habitat, Restore Birds, Artist Amelia Hansen *2016: Spread Your Wings for Bird Conservation, Artist Lionel Worrell *2017: Stopover Sites, Artist Rocio Landivar *2018: Year of the Bird, Artist Paula Andrea Romero *2019: Protect Birds: Be the Solution to Plastic Pollution, Artist Arnaldo Toledo International Migratory Bird Day 2016 poster by Lionel Worrell Major Partners: U.S. Forest Service, Partners in Flight, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, Nature Canada, Birds & Beans, Pepco Holdings, Get To Know, US Geological Society, Ornilux, Birdzilla, Optics for the Tropics, and Society for the Conservation and Study of Caribbean Birds.  World Migratory Bird Day  In 2006, the United Nations established World Migratory Bird Day to be held on the second weekend of May every year. The event was founded as an effort of the UN's Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds to raise awareness of the migratory linkages between regions of the globe. World Migratory Bird Day events have been held in 118 nations. Each year, the United Nations announces a uniting theme for official events. Bird Day and National Bird Day (United States) Bird watching at Landsort, April 2009 Bird Day was established by Charles Almanzo Babcock, the Oil City superintendent of schools, in 1894. It was the first holiday in the United States dedicated to the celebration of birds. Babcock intended it to advance bird conservation as a moral value.HistoryCooperative.org , Armitage, Kevin C. (2007) \\"Bird Day for Kids: Progressive Conservation in Theory and Practice\\" Environmental History 12(3): pp. 528‚Äì551 It is celebrated on May 4 of every year. National Bird Day is an annual holiday with half a million adherents who celebrate through birdwatching, studying birds, and other bird-related activities.TimesHerald.com Bird adoption is a particularly important National Bird Day activity. According to the newspaper Atlanta Journal-Constitution, many bird enthusiasts celebrate by adopting birds and by educating future bird owners about the special issues involved with taking care of birds, including their \\"screaming, biting, constant cleanups, the need for daily interaction and a varied diet\\". The Avian Welfare Coalition's National Bird Day campaign aims to improve the welfare of parrots and other birds by discouraging their purchase as pets, and encouraging the support of wild bird habitat conservation programs and captive bird rescue organizations and sanctuaries. National Bird Day takes place every year on January 5. Bird Day (United Kingdom) Since 1979, bird lovers in the United Kingdom have taken part in the annual Big Garden Birdwatch. In the annual event coordinated by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, up to half a million people spend an hour counting birds.

The structure of phyloXML is described by XML Schema Definition (XSD) language. A shortcoming of current formats for describing phylogenetic trees (such as Nexus and Newick/New Hampshire) is a lack of a standardized means to annotate tree nodes and branches with distinct data fields (which in the case of a basic species tree might be: species names, branch lengths, and possibly multiple support values). Data storage and exchange is even more cumbersome in studies in which trees are the result of a reconciliation of some kind: * gene-function studies (requires annotation of nodes with taxonomic information as well as gene names, and possibly gene-duplication data) * evolution of host-parasite interactions (requires annotation of tree nodes with taxonomic information for both host and parasite) * phylogeographic studies (requires annotation of tree nodes with taxonomic and geographic information) To alleviate this, a variety of ad-hoc, special purpose formats have come into use (such as the NHX format, which focuses on the needs of gene-function and phylogenomic studies).

It was a straight-to-DVD release distributed by Dimension Extreme. This film was a Blockbuster Exclusive. Plot Rene is in the bath having a conversation with her cousin Zane, who is in the bathroom with her. He pushes her underwater, and she begins to drown. While looking up at his face from under the water, she sees the visage of an old woman above her. She awakes with a start, having fallen asleep and begun to drown. Her boyfriend Danny wakes her up, and the two make out. Zane, who has enlisted the help of Phil to research his family history, visits his family home with Phil, Rene, Danny, and her two sorority pledges, Julie \\"Cow\\" and Laura \\"Dog\\". The two pledges have been forced to dress up as animals as an initiation. Zane constantly sees an old woman on the side of the road, culminating in her appearance in the middle of the road, which causes him to almost crash. Lester, the caretaker, is living in a trailer on the land, searching for gold. He has found some, but does not tell anyone.

The girls are dared to perform The Godiva Run to Lester's caravan and bring back one of his stuffed animals. Julie chooses to wear her pants and Laura chooses to wear her boots with Laura boldly and happily streaking naked through the desert towards Lester's caravan and accomplishes the task, but Julie doesn't because she sprains her ankle. Rene gives Julie one more task to take off her clothes, except for underwear, and be blindfolded. Rene takes Zane's belt and uses it on Julie as a test of trust. Soon, Rene and Laura depart, leaving Julie standing there. Danny decides to go get Phil but finds out that he's dead just before his face is cut off. When the lights go out, Zane goes out to check the machine to find it's still functioning normally, but the cable was cut. Zane finds Danny's faceless body, as do Rene and Laura. Zane, Rene and Laura dash back inside the house, thinking Lester is behind Danny's murder, but they find Lester dead as well. They try to escape with their car, but find it has been sabotaged. They grab Lester's keys and Laura dashes to Lester's caravan to get his truck. While Zane and Rene are still in the house, Zane gets locked in another room and Rene is knocked unconscious with the spirit scratching the words \\"Sins Of The Father\\" on her back. Zane finally breaks through and kills the woman, but whilst barricading them in a room, the woman appears and knocks Zane unconscious. Laura returns with Lester's truck and the woman is about to slaughter Laura, but disappears after seeing a tattoo that's similar to the necklace Rene had throughout the movie. Laura escapes, while Rene and Zane wake to find themselves in some kind of box. The old woman quickly grabs the necklace and drops the gold ring taken by the caretaker in the beginning of the movie. Rene and Zane scream in fear as the old woman buries them alive.

The settlement at West Halton has existed since at least the Anglo Saxon period when it was traditionally thought to have been founded as a monastery or minster by St √Üthelthryth. Excavations by the University of Sheffield confirmed the presence of a 7th-century settlement . West Halton is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as \\"Haltone\\". The name has been translated as \\"farmstead in a nook or corner of land\\". West Halton has a central village green. There is a public house, the Butchers Arms, and a village hall which has served as a part-time post office since the village post office closed. There are no shops in the village. The church is dedicated to St Etheldreda; it was built in 1695 as a replacement for an earlier building destroyed by fire in 1692.

Biography Robeson was born in Brooklyn to entertainer and activist Paul Robeson and Eslanda Goode Robeson. As his family moved to Europe, he grew up in England (visiting the St Mary's Town and Country School in London) and Moscow, in the Soviet Union. In Moscow, he attended an elite school. The Robesons returned to the United States in 1939 to live first in Harlem, New York, and after 1941 in Enfield, Connecticut. Robeson graduated from Enfield High School and attended Cornell University, where he graduated with a degree in electrical engineering in 1949. Robeson's paternal grandfather Reverend William Drew Robeson was born into slavery, escaped from a plantation in his teens; cf. , , and eventually became the minister of Princeton's Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church in 1881. Robeson's paternal grandmother, Maria Louisa Bustill; cf. , was from a prominent Quaker family of mixed ancestry: African, Anglo-American, and Lenape.; cf. ; Robeson worked on the legacy of his father, published a two- volume biography of him, and created an archive of his father's films, photographs, recordings, letters, and publications. As an advocate for social and racial justice he shared the political views of his father, indicating that \\"like him, I am a black radical\\". He was married to Marilyn Greenberg in 1949; the couple had two children, David (died 1998) and Susan, and one grandchild. Robeson died of lymphoma in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 2014. Paul Robeson Sr. legacy Robeson maintained on many occasions that his father \\"never joined the Communist Party or any party for that matter‚Äîhe was an independent artist and would never submit to any kind of organizational discipline.\\" On his own politics he stated: \\"I was much more an organized political person\\", he said, adding that from about 1948 to 1962, he was a member of the Communist Party USA. \\"It was an instrument, a radical instrument that could help advance the interests of African-Americans. It helped build the early civil-rights movement and independent trade union movement in the 1930s, '40s and '50s.\\" He said he left the party in 1962 after \\"it became bureaucratic and corrupt\\". Robeson's father, Paul Sr., was one of his closest friends and protectors, traveling and living with him intermittently during his life. Following his father's death, Robeson Jr. worked extensively to establish the Paul Robeson Archive and the Paul Robeson Foundation. The archive, housed at Howard University's Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, is the largest repository in the Western hemisphere of Robeson documents and articles, totaling well over 50,000 items.

Political parties in the UK may be funded through membership fees, party donations or through state funding, the latter of which is reserved for administrative costs. The general restrictions in the UK were held in Bowman v United Kingdom[1998] ECHR 4 to be fully compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, article 10. History The first effort to regulate the financial dimension of political competition was the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883. Although this landmark legislation was concerned with constituency candidates, their campaign expenses and their agents only, all other efforts to create a political finance regime started from here. Edward 16 The next legislative step to deal with the subject was the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 that sought to end the selling of titles in exchange for donations to political parties. In August 1976 the Committee on Financial Aid to Political Parties, chaired by Lord Houghton of Sowerby, proposed that financial aid to political parties should be given in two forms: (a) general grants to the central organisations for their general purposes and (b) a limited reimbursement of election expenses to parliamentary and local government candidates.Report of the Committee on Financial Aid to Political Parties, chaired by Lord Houghton of Sowerby, London: H.M.S.O, 1976, Cmnd. 6601, p. xv. Starting in 2006, political funding came under scrutiny as concerns grew that the largest British political parties were too dependent on a handful of wealthy donors. Furthermore, during the Cash for Honours scandal, concern grew even more. A concern of the 1970s had been that the major parties were unable to raise sufficient funds to operate successfully.Report of the Committee on Financial Aid to Political Parties (Chairman: Lord Houghton of Sowerby), London: H.M.S.O., 1976, Cmd. 6601; Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, British Political Finance, 1830-1980. Washington, DC: AEI, 1981. The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA) was an act that established the Electoral Commission and required all political parties to register with it, set down accounting requirements for political parties, and introduced controls on donations. 2006 Sir Hayden Phillips inquiry In March 2006, former civil servant Sir Hayden Phillips was charged with setting up an inquiry to come up with proposal for reform. It reported a year later. He recommended capping individual donations at ¬£50,000 and capping spending for political campaigns. He also suggested increasing state funding by ¬£25m and expanding its reach. 2008 Ministry of Justice report In June 2008, the Ministry of Justice released a white paper analyzing party finance and expenditure. The paper proposed to tighten controls on spending by parties and candidates, substantially strengthen the powers of the Electoral Commission, and increase the transparency of donations. 2011 Committee on Standards in Public Life report In November 2011 the Committee on Standards on Public Life, chaired by Sir Christopher Kelly, published a Report on \\"Political Party Finance. Ending the big donor culture\\". It is their 13th report, Cm. 8208. The report made five main recommendations: (a) Contribution limit of GBP10,000 per donor, party and year; (b) this limit should not apply to affiliated trade union affiliation fees if such fees are raised by an \\"opt in\\"; (c) existing limits for campaign spending should be cut by about 15 per cent; (d) in addition to the present \\"policy development grant\\" eligible parties should be granted public funding at the rate of GBP3.00 per vote in Westminster elections and GBP 1.50 per vote in devolved and European elections; (e) income tax relief should be available for donations up to GBP 1,000 and membership fees to political parties. Membership subscriptions Membership subscriptions (\\"subs\\") provide one source of funding for political parties. However, in recent times membership has declined and campaign costs have grown. The Green Party is the only major political party in the UK which receives the majority of its funding through membership fees and these are what cover the running costs of the organisation. Membership subs have become a more significant source in income for both the SNP and Labour in recent years, as both have seen substantial increases in membership. Donations The Conservative Party relies on donations mostly from individuals and companies; as well as these sources the Labour Party receives a significant portion of its donations from trade unions. For example, in the third quarter of 2009, eighteen political parties reported donations totalling ¬£9,532,598 (excluding public funds). The Conservative Party received ¬£5,269,186, the Labour party received ¬£3,045,377 and the Liberal Democrats received ¬£816,663. Donations typically peak before elections. Between the 6th of April and the 6th of May 2010 (a general election campaign month) the Conservatives took ¬£7,317,602, Labour ¬£5,283,199 and the Liberal Democrats ¬£724,000. State funding Opposition parties receive state funding to pay administration cost; Short MoneyGay. The Funding of Political Parties. pp. 9. in the House of Commons starting in 1975, and Cranborne Money in the House of Lords starting in 1996 however, there is no state funding available to parties for campaign purposes. In addition there is a general policy development grant available to parties with two MPs or one MP and one MEP.Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 Transparency Donations worth over ¬£7,500 to national parties must be declared, as must be donations worth ¬£1,500 or more to local associations. Donations to members' associations ‚Äì groups whose members are primarily or entirely members of a single political party ‚Äì also need to be declared above ¬£7,500. This produces a loophole where donors can donate larger sums to local candidates while remaining anonymous, by channeling those donations through a members' association such as the United and Cecil Club. For a while, as a loophole, loans did not have to be declared. Northern Ireland political parties are exempt from revealing the identity of party donors due to security reasons.

The same year he ceased his professional activities and traveled across Europe, before he returned and organized the food supply of Zagreb during World War I. Heinzel was also an early automobilist, who along with Ferdinand Budicki drove the first car in Zagreb, and was one of the founders of the Croatian automobile club in 1906. He participated in many early car races, including winning the first race for the championship of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia in 1912. During the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Heinzel was first elected mayor in 1920 and served until the August 1921, when the city administration was temporarily disbanded. In 1922, he was elected as a member of the Croatian Bloc. In 1926 and 1927 he had a falling out with the Party of Rights and the Croatian Peasant Party, but was re-elected in the subsequent election. His administration organized the construction of large sections of today's Pe≈°ƒçenica, Trnje, Tre≈°njevka, Maksimir and other city neighborhoods. His contributions included the construction and expansion of numerous hospitals, the beginning of the Dolac Market, and the reconstruction of the La≈°ƒçinska road, later Sajmi≈°na, and today the Vjekoslav Heinzel Avenue, a prominent north‚Äìsouth avenue in the eastern part of the city that starts at the Eugen Kvaternik Square and divides Trnje and Pe≈°ƒçenica. During Heinzel's term as mayor, Zagreb got its first 0.35 kW radio transmitter on 15 June 1926. On 1 April the same year, the city installed its first automatic switchboard, with the capacity of 7,000 telephone subscribers. Heinzel's efforts came at a considerable cost, however, as the city had to take out a loan of 250 million Yugoslav dinars, a topic of much criticism at the time.

Smyers is also considered to be the University's first quarterback. Prep school Born in Marion Center, Pennsylvania, Smyers attended Bucknell University when it was a college preparatory school during his senior year of 1888-89. At Bucknell, he had an academic average of 9 out of a scale of 10, considered an outstanding academic achievement, in course that included Natural Philosophy, Rhetoric, Algebra, Caesar, Scriptural History, Composition, Declamation, and Elocution. While there, Smyers was involved in an informal football team, not part of the school's regular sports, which was probably learned from older brothers attending other schools and then taught to pals after school.Genealogy.com: The Schmeyer/Smyers Family in America, accessdate=2009-02-01 University years In the fall of 1889, the 130 pound Smyers enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh, then called the Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP), to continue his education. He and senior student John Scott assembled a football team of which only three of the players had previously witnessed the sport. Smyers made himself quarterback and Scott was the center and one informal game was played, a loss to Shadyside Academy in 1889. In preparation for the following season, the first official football season of football recognized by the University of Pittsburgh, Smyers and his teammates took up a collection and purchased a football for practices and games, however players were responsible for their own uniforms and Smyers' own uniform was pieced together by his mother and sister. The first official game for the University was held on October 11, 1890 when the Allegheny Athletic Association's opponent, Shadyside Academy, failed to appear for its game at Exposition Park. Allegheny A.A. called Smyers who brought the WUP team as a replacement. WUP was defeated 38-0. Smyers' team next faced Washington & Jefferson College, losing 32-0, but closed out its inaugural three game season with a win over Geneva College 10-4. The following season saw Smyers suffer a broken nose in a 40-6 losing effort against Washington and Jefferson and the team finished 2-5 with wins over Western Pennsylvania Medical College, which became affiliated with WUP in 1892 and later merged with the University in 1908 to become its medical school, and Geneva College, who WUP lost two other contests to that same season. Perhaps the most important development for the second season of football had been Smyers recruitment of Joeseph Trees from Normal University of Pennsylvania, who at 210 pounds became WUP's first subsidized athlete. Later in life, Trees made millions in the oil industry and became an important benefactor for the University and athletic department. Today, an athletic facility named Trees Hall still bears his name on the University of Pittsburgh's Oakland campus. In a letter from Harriet Smyers, Bert's daughter- in-law and wife of son William Hays Smyers, to the University of Pittsburgh in 1990, sent in preparation for celebration of 100 years of football there, further details about Bert are given, as follows: > Once they were near the goal line and having trouble getting over so (Bert) > whispered to his pals just to pick him up bodily and throw him over and he'd > hold out the ball. Since he was only about 131 pounds this was easy and they > made the touchdown. He told the grandchildren, 'I was Pitt's first forward > pass.' The flying wedge as I'm sure you know was outlawed because of the > serious injuries that resulted. The team locked arms in form of a wedge and > plowed through (or over) the opposing team. At one game only 10 men on the > (Pitt) team showed up. The opposing team let them \\"borrow\\" another man > \\"elsewhere\\" and make up the 11. Your guess is as good as mine as to where > the extra man came from. (Bert) claimed he was the 2nd strongest man at > Pitt. The strongest man could chin himself with ond arm and (Bert) never > managed that. Legacy A press release from Pitt, circa 1930, gave the following account of Bert's place in football history: > The man who started football at the University of Pittsburgh (at that time, > 1889, Western University of Pennsylvania) is still at it. He is Bert Smyers, > attorney, member of the Ohio State Game committee, working to enthuse the > followers of the Panthers for the trip to Columbus, Nov. 15.

He enjoyed target shooting with his sons. Based on the obituary of son Bertrand Jr., Smyers was also the village blacksmith in Marion Center. Bertrand died on June 18, 1953 at Pittsburgh, and is buried at Marion Center Cemetery. Smyers had 3 sons: Bertrand Jr., William, and Edward.https://archive.org/stream/prominentfamilie1912pitt/prominentfamilie1912pitt_djvu.txt Bert's daughter-in-law Harriet also recalled in a letter an incident later in Bert's life when he was 60: > Once at a Rotary Club picnic they had a contest to see who could climb > furthest up the flag pole.

Acquisition and commissioning Despatch was the commercial steamer America when the U.S. Navy purchased her in November 1873 at New York City. She was commissioned on 23 November 1873, Lieutenant Commander Frederick Rodgers in command. The Virginius Affair, 1873 Purchased for dispatch duty because of her speed, Despatch was assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron and joined the fleet in December 1873 at Key West, Florida, in anticipation of war with Spain over the seizure of the American filibustering steamer Virginius by the Spanish Navy corvette . The Spanish had taken Virginius into port at Santiago de Cuba in Cuba and summarily condemned her, with 53 of her passengers and crew executed (see Virginius Affair). After lengthy diplomatic negotiations, 102 survivors were delivered on board the U.S. Navy sloop-of-war , and Virginius was ordered to be turned over to Captain W. D. Whiting, Chief of Staff of the North Atlantic Squadron. Despatch carried Captain Whiting to Bahia Honda, Cuba, to take charge of Virginius, and took Virginius in tow for Key West. Despatch remained with the fleet, serving as a dispatch vessel and participating in squadron drills until arriving at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., which became her new base on 24 April 1874. Operations from Washington, D.C., 1874‚Äì77 From 1874-1877, Despatch carried out special duty assignments from her base at Washington, D.C., and at various times operated with the North Atlantic Squadron along the United States East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. She was kept ready for use as a dispatch and relief vessel, and on several occasions transported the United States Secretary of the Navy and United States Senate committees. She also towed monitors from one point to another and experimented with spar torpedoes at Newport, Rhode Island. Operations in the Ottoman Empire, 1877‚Äì79 Despatch departed on 20 April 1877 for the eastern Mediterranean and a special assignment with the United States Embassy at Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire. Arriving there on 14 June, Despatch carried dispatches and transported the American minister to the Ottoman Empire, which was in turmoil because of war with the Russian Empire and internal political unrest. Despatch was detached early in 1879, and returned to Washington, D.C., where she was decommissioned on 9 July 1879. Cadet training, presidential yacht duty, and special assignments, 1880‚Äì91 After extensive repairs, Despatch was recommissioned on 8 June 1880 for use as a training ship and cruised along the U.S. East Coast with cadet engineers from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, on board. Despatch was again out of commission at Washington, D.C., from 23 September to 19 October 1880, then operated principally in the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay and along the U.S. East Coast from Norfolk, Virginia, to Maine until 1891, carrying out special assignments. She was frequently used by the President of the United States as the first presidential yacht, as well as by the Secretary of the Navy and other members of the United States Cabinet, Congressional committees, members of naval boards conducting inspections, and for varied ceremonial duties. One of the most important of these ceremonial events occurred on 28 October 1886 when she transported President Grover Cleveland, his private secretary, and three members of his cabinet, to and from Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor for the dedication and unveiling of the Statue of Liberty on 28 October 1886. Over the years, she also carried despatches and men to the fleet and along the U.S. East Coast, towed into port or destroyed damaged ships and wrecks, and escorted new ships during their sea trials. From 12 December 1881 to 3 June 1882, Despatch operated at Hispaniola to conduct hydrographic surveys of Saman√° Bay and the Yuna River. Loss After carrying Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy on a cruise along the New England coast to review the fleet in August 1891, Despatch put into New York City, from which she sailed for Washington, D.C., on 9 October 1891. Early on the morning of 10 October, in a gale, she was wrecked on Assateague Island off the Virginia coast. With the aid of men from the Assateague Lifesaving Station of the United States Life- Saving Service, all of Despatch‚Ä≤s crew got ashore safely. The wreck of Despatch was sold for salvage on 12 November 1891.

Early life Meyerowitz's father was a wealthy German businessman and his mother a Russian pianist who had studied with Arthur Rubinstein. At the time of the 1905 Revolution, the family moved from Russia to Switzerland, where Meyerowitz was educated at a Pestalozzi school. His education was completed in England, with holidays in Russia. The family were in Russia when war broke out in 1914 and, because of their German nationality, they were interned at Ekaterinburg. They moved to Berlin in 1916 as part of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Germany. In 1918, Meyerowitz served briefly in the German army. After the war, he returned to Berlin to study art. Together with his future wife, Eva Lewin- Richter, he developed an enthusiasm for the art of West Africa. Meyerowitz went on to study woodcarving at the Berlin Kunstgewerbeschule.Harrod, Tanya, \\"'The Breath of Reality': Michael Cardew and the development of studio pottery in the 1930s and 1940s\\", Journal of Design History, Vol.2., Nos. 2 and 3, 1989, The Design History Society He became an admirer of the educational theories of Franz Ci≈æek. Work in Africa On the completion of his art training, Meyerowitz moved to South Africa with his wife Eva, where he established a reputation as a wood sculptor. He taught for five years at Cape Town University and opened a school of art. In 1935, he made a study of the crafts in Lesotho (then Basutoland), which he wrote up in A Report on the Possibilities of the Development of Village Crafts in Basutoland (Morija Printing Works, 1936). He organised an exhibition of African Arts and Crafts as part of the International Educational Conference in Salisbury, Rhodesia. He said in a speech that the traditional African art on show was \\"good, because it still fulfilled its purpose\\", but that the work brought in from the schools and institutions was \\"trash ... which we, in the name of education, had inflicted on the people of Africa\\".Cardew, Michael, \\"A Pioneer Potter\\", London, Collins, 1989, p.125 The Rev. H.M.Grace, the Principal of Achimota College in the Gold Coast (Ghana), offered Meyerowitz the job of arts and crafts supervisor. Achimota College had been founded in 1927 as a selective boarding school to train an African √©lite. It combined Western educational methods with the study of local customs, languages, biology and geography. Meyerowitz and Eva made a survey of the indigenous crafts of the Gold Coast, which they found to be in decline. At Achimota, he replaced Western-style art classes based on academic drawing with an arts and crafts approach based on local skills and traditions. Institute of West African Arts From 1937, Meyerowitz began to develop a scheme for an Institute of West African Arts, Industries and Social Sciences, which would be a \\"marriage of the aesthetic skill and power to modern technique\\".\\"The Institute of West African Arts, Industries, and Social Sciences\\", in Man, Vol.43, Sept‚ÄìOct 1943, pp.112‚Äì114, published by the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. It would investigate local arts and crafts, teach certain native crafts in the light of European experience and create local craft industries. It would also investigate local history, tribal life, customs, religion and economic conditions. This scheme was approved by the West African Governors' Conference at Lagos in 1939 and the Advisory Committee on Education in 1940. Before the war, African colonies had depended on the export of commodities, which was made almost impossible by enemy shipping. The Colonial Office adopted instead a policy developing indigenous industries and eventually accepted Meyerowitz's idea. In 1943, the Institute was set up under the direction of the Rev. Robert Stopford. Meyerowitz's colleague Michael Cardew records that only the power of Meyerowitz's \\"magnetic eloquence (backed up by the pressure of the war) could have persuaded the Colonial Office to support the project and the Treasury to release the necessary funds.\\" Meyerowitz planned the Institute on the basis of production units that would combine the arts with industry. \\"If industries are to be established for West African needs,\\" he argued, \\"the only alternative to white capital and coloured labour is a self-contained development of the kind now proposed; and the people as a whole benefit more from many local production units on a co-operative basis than from concentrated industrial centres\\". In 1936, on the recommendation of the English studio potter Michael Cardew, Meyerowitz appointed Harry Davis to teach pottery at Achimota and expand the pottery department to manufacture bricks, tiles, water coolers and glazed ware. The College also produced textiles. Davis resigned in 1942, and was replaced by Cardew, who undertook a large expansion of the pottery on a site at Alajo, with the aim of creating a profitable business that would meet all the pottery needs of West Africa, including that of the British Army. The pottery made continuing losses and the educated Africans who worked as apprentices found little to admire in Cardew's studio pottery approach.Harrod, Tanya, \\"Achimota College and the West African Institute\\", in Cardew, Michael, A Pioneer Potter, London, Collins, 1989 Grace had retired from the college in 1940, depriving Meyerowitz of a useful ally. Stopford returned to England in 1945. The financial losses at the Institute brought its future into question. Death While in London in 1945, Meyerowitz discovered that his mother, who had remained in Russia, had died in the Siege of Leningrad. He committed suicide in the same year. The inquest recorded that he had suffered from \\"manic depressive cyclothymia\\". Shortly after his death, the Institute of West African Arts was closed.

After the independence, it was transferred to the Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was amalgamated with the 8th Punjab and Bahawalpur Regiments. During more than a hundred years of military service, the 10th Baluch Regiment acquired a distinguished record amongst the regiments of the British Indian Army. Its list of honours and awards includes four Victoria Crosses. The Bombay Army The Baluch Regiment originated in the Army of Bombay Presidency in 1844, when Sir Charles Napier raised the 1st Belooch (old spelling of Baluch) Battalion (raised as the Scinde Beloochee Corps and designated as 27th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry in 1861) for local service in the newly conquered province of Sindh. Two years later, another Belooch battalion was raised (designated as the 29th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry in 1861), while in 1858, John Jacob raised Jacob's Rifles (30th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry), which would soon become the 3rd Belooch Regiment. The term 'local' was interpreted fairly loosely when it became necessary to send the 2nd Beloochees to the Persian War in 1856-57, a campaign frequently overshadowed by the events of the Indian Mutiny in 1857. The 1st was in Karachi when the news of the insurrection reached the Commissioner. Sir Bartle Frere dispatched them with all haste, on foot across the Sindh desert in May, to join the siege artillery train on its way to Delhi; the only Bombay unit to join the Delhi Field Force. The regiment was brought into line for its services in North India as the 27th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. Meanwhile, the 2nd Beloochees were also regularized as the 29th Regiment. In 1862, the 2nd Beloochees were dispatched to China to suppress the Taiping Rebellion. Two years later, they became some of the first foreign troops to be stationed in Japan, when two companies were sent to Yokohama as a part of the garrison guarding the British legation. The 1st Beloochees greatly distinguished themselves in the tough Abyssinian Campaign of 1868 and were made Light Infantry as a reward. All Baloch battalions took part in the Second Afghan War of 1878-80, where the Jacob's Rifles suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of Maiwand. The 1st Belooch Regiment again distinguished itself in 1885-87 during the Third Burma War.Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (1998). History of the Baloch Regiment 1820-1939. BRC. In 1891, two battalions of Bombay Infantry also became \\"Baluchi,\\" when they were reconstituted with Baluchis, Hazaras and Pathans from Baluchistan and localized in the province. The first of these, the 24th (Baluchistan) Infantry was raised in 1820, while the other, 26th (Baluchistan) Infantry was raised in 1825.Chaldecott, Lt Col OA. (1935). The First Battalion (DCO) and the Tenth Battalion, the Tenth Baluch Regiment. Gale & Polden. Following the Kitchener Reforms of 1903, these battalions were redesignated as the 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry, 126th Baluchistan Infantry, 127th Queen Mary's Own Baluch Light Infantry, 129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis and 130th King George's Own Baluchis (Jacob's Rifles). In 1914, their full dress uniforms included red trousers worn with rifle green or drab tunics.127th Queen Mary's Own Baluch Light Infantry. Watercolour by AC Lovett, c. 1910.

During the First World War, most of the regiments raised second battalions, while the 124th Baluchistan Infantry raised two battalions. Only 2/124th Baluchistan Infantry of the wartime raisings was retained after the post-war reforms. The 129th DCO Baluchis served on the Western Front in France and Belgium, where they became the first Indian regiment to attack the Germans and the only Indian regiment to fight in both the First & Second Battles of Ypres. At Hollebeke, during the First Ypres, Sepoy Khudadad Khan became the first Muslim and pre partition Indian soldier to win the Victoria Cross; Britain's highest decoration for valour. Prior to 1911 pre partition Indian soldiers had not been eligible for the Victoria Cross. The battalion would go on to serve with distinction in German East Africa alongside the 127th QMO Baluch Light Infantry and 130th KGO Baluchis. Meanwhile, the 1st and 3rd Battalions of 124th DCO Baluchistan Infantry served in Persia, while the 2nd distinguished itself in Mesopotamia and Palestine. Inter-War Period After the First World War, a major re- organization of British Indian Army took place. Most of the wartime units were disbanded, while the remaining single-battalion regiments were merged to form large regimental groups of 4-6 battalions each. Among these was the 10th Baluch Regiment, formed in 1922 at Rajkot (Rajasthan) from the five old Baluch battalions and the second battalion of 124th Baluchistan Infantry. The regimental depot later shifted to Karachi. The distinctive rifle green and red uniform of the old Baluch battalions was adopted by the entire regiment. The officers wore a cherry boss surmounted by a silver 'X' on field and forage caps, while the old battalion badges continued to be worn on pagris and helmets by the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th Battalions. It was not until 1945 that a single cap badge was adopted by the regiment on introduction of berets during the Second World War. It consisted of a Roman numeral 'X' within a crescent moon, a crown above and title scroll below, all in white metal. The badges of rank were in black metal with red edging, while the lanyard was of rifle green cord with two red runners. Another distinctive feature of Baluchi uniforms were plain silver ball buttons worn on service and mess dresses.Poulsom, Lt Col NW, and Ahmad, Lt Col RN. (2011).

The Tenth Baluch Regiment in the Second World War. BRC. The regiment's record of service in the war was once again most impressive. It suffered 6572 casualties and won numerous gallantry awards including two Victoria Crosses to Naik Fazal Din and Sepoy Bhandari Ram. During the Second World War, the regiment raised another ten battalions, although most of them were disbanded after the war. At the end of 1945, the 10th Baluch Regiment lost its number and became The Baluch Regiment. Post-independence At the time of independence, the active battalions were 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th & 17th. The regiment was allotted to Pakistan. Dogra companies of the Baluch Regiment were transferred to the Indian Army. The Regimental Centre shifted to Quetta in 1947 to make room for the Government offices in the new capital of Pakistan. In 1948, the 6th and 8th Battalions were re-raised in response to the war with India in Kashmir, where the 4th Battalion greatly distinguished itself in the Battle of Pandu. In 1956, major reorganization took place in the Pakistan Army and larger infantry groups were created by amalgamating the existing infantry regiments. As a result, the 8th Punjab and Bahawalpur Regiments were absorbed by the Baluch Regiment (now called the Baloch Regiment). The new line up of the regiment was:185px * 1 Baluch - 1/8th Punjab (The Gallant One) * 2 Baluch - 2/8th Punjab * 3 Baluch - 3/8th Punjab * 4 Baluch - 4/8th Punjab (Prince of Wales's Own) * 5 Baluch - 5/8th Punjab (Burma) * 6 Baluch - 1 Baluch (Duchess of Connaught's Own) * 7 Baluch - 2 Baluch * 8 Baluch - 1 Bahawalpur (Sadiq) * 9 Baluch - 2 Bahawalpur (Haroon) * 10 Baluch - 3 Baluch (Queen Mary's Own) * 11 Baluch - 4 Baluch (Duke of Connaught's Own) * 12 Baluch - 5 Baluch (King George V's Own) (Jacob's Rifles) * 13 Baluch - 6/8th Punjab * 14 Baluch - 6 Baluch * 15 Baluch - 7 Baluch * 16 Baluch - 8 Baluch * 17 Baluch - 8/8th Punjab * 18 Baluch - 9/8th Punjab * 19 Baluch (SSG) - 17 Baluch * 20 Baluch - 3 Bahawalpur (Abbas) * 21 Baluch - 4 Bahawalpur Battle Honours * Aden, Reshire, Bushire, Khoosh-ab, Persia, Delhi 1857, Central India, Abyssinia, Kandahar 1880, Afghanistan 1878-80, Tel- el-Kebir, Egypt 1882, Burma 1885‚Äì87, British East Africa 1896, British East Africa 1897-99, China 1900. * World War I: Messines 1914, Armenti√®res 1914, Ypres 1914, Gheluvelt, Festubert 1914, Givenchy 1914, Neuve Chapelle, Ypres 1915, St Julien, France and Flanders 1914‚Äì15, Egypt 1915, Megiddo, Sharon, Palestine 1918, Aden, Kut al Amara 1917, Baghdad, Mesopotamia 1916‚Äì18, Persia 1915-18, NW Frontier, India 1917, Kilimanjaro, Behobeho, East Africa 1915-18. * Afghanistan 1919. * World War II: Gallabat, Barentu, Keren, Massawa, Abyssinia 1940-41, The Cauldron, Mersa Matruh, Ruweisat Ridge, El Alamein, North Africa 1940‚Äì43, Landing in Sicily, Sicily 1943, Castel Frentano, Orsogna, Arezzo, Monte Cedrone, Citta di Castello, Gothic Line, Monte Calvo, Pian di Castello, Croce, Gemmano Ridge, San Marino, Monte Farneto, San Paolo- Monte Spaccato, Cesena, Savio Bridgehead, Casa Bettini, Idice Bridgehead, Italy 1943-45, Athens, Greece 1944-45, North Malaya, Machang, Singapore Island, Malaya 1941‚Äì42, Kuzeik, North Arakan, Maungdaw, Point 551, Shwebo, Kyaukmyaung Bridgehead, Mandalay, Capture of Meiktila, Defence of Meiktila, The Irrawaddy, Pegu 1945, Sittang 1945, Burma 1942‚Äì45. *Kashmir 1948.Ahmad, Lt Col RN.

In 1383, the Treusch von Buttlar were lords of Willershausen and adjacent areas. Already at the end of the 13th Century, the residential tower and the defensive tower of the present castle were built. The Treusch von Buttlar were the owners until the 1757. The castle came to the von Kutzleben family and the Schwebheim branch of the von Bibra family in 1757. The estate was divided between the two families on 27 September 1817. Ernst von Bibra sold their portion in 1850 to Landgrave Carl August of Hesse. From 1889 to 1992 the Landgraves of Hesse were owner of the property. Today, a golf course is maintained. The church in Willershausen is worth seeing. The Robbers inspiration The relationship to Friedrich Schiller and the history of his play The Robbers is especially interesting: family ambiguities in the family of Treusch von Buttlar at Willershausen, around 1730/40, served as an inspiration and background to his drama.

It stands on land once occupied by Woodhall mansion and estate. The mansion stood where St Martin's church now stands on Mansion Avenue. Woodhall is on a north facing slope, overlooking the River Clyde and is bounded on the north by the River Clyde, on the south by Parkhill Avenue, on the west by Port Glasgow cemetery and on the east by what is now the Castlebank housing estate which is on the site of the former Broadfield Hospital. History Built in the 1930s as the town expanded eastwards, Woodhall was a thriving community centred on Woodhall Square and the adjoining Woodhall Terrace at the foot of the hill. Mansion Avenue and Heggies Avenue climb up the steep hill to opposite ends of Parkhill Avenue, whilst Brightside, Pleasantside and Sunnyside Avenues (plus a branch of Mansion Avenue) follow the contours of the hill and are therefore reasonably flat. Woodhall Terrace consisted of fine red sandstone tenements along the south side of the A8 Glasgow Road. Woodhall Square was a major bus terminus, with a service every ten minutes to Gourock at peak times and hourly \\"through\\" services to Glasgow and Largs. Dino's Italian Cafe and shop stood in the square and was popular with day-trippers heading for the bus to Gourock or those going by foot to picnic at nearby Parklea on the banks of the Clyde. There was a busy Co-op grocery shop on Brightside Avenue at the junction with Mansion Avenue, one of several local Co-op shops in Port Glasgow. Further up the hill, Parkhill Square was also a bus terminus until the late 1960s at which time the buses started to run on up the hill to Oronsay Avenue in Park Farm and Bardrainney. Industry There was no industry in the area until a small industrial estate named Kelburn Business Park opened in the 1980s, alongside the realigned A8 dual carriageway. Two of the three units are occupied by Vango and White House Products Ltd, the third unit was vacated by Chinese company Amphenol in 2001. The adjacent Woodhall Park, which was home to Port Glasgow F.C., better known as The Port Juniors, was cleared and zoned for industrial use by Inverclyde Council in 2000 - the land remained derelict for twelve years until the business park was extended in 2013/14.Geograph photo of business park construction 2009 All but one of the tenements on Woodhall Terrace were demolished in 2002, along with many of the houses on \\"the avenues\\" and all of the houses on and to the east of Parkhill Square, leaving the area with a forlorn, ghost-town look today. Dino has long gone, but the building survives and is occupied by a Post Office and licensed grocer. The Co-op building on Brightside has become Riverview Resource Centre. St Martin's Church and hall are still there, behind a stockade-like fence. Further along Mansion Avenue is Tree Tops Nursery, standing alone on a street where the houses have all been demolished. The future Plans by River Clyde Homes to build new houses on Parkhill Avenue were reported by local newspaper The Greenock Telegraph on 29 January 2009. Public transport The area is served by Woodhall railway station on the Inverclyde Line which has regular services to and from Glasgow Central and Gourock, and also Wemyss Bay during early mornings and evenings only.

Man and woman wearing the himation Caryatid from the Erechtheion wearing a peplos. The blousing, or kolpos, is atop zone Clothing in ancient Greece primarily consisted of the chiton, peplos, himation, and chlamys. Ancient Greek men and women typically wore two pieces of clothing draped about the body: an undergarment ( : chit≈çn or : p√©plos) and a cloak ( : him√°tion or : chlam√Ωs). Ancient Greek clothing was mainly based on necessity, function, materials, and protection rather than identity. Thus, clothes were quite simple, draped, loose-fitting and free flowing. Customarily, clothing was homemade and cut to various lengths of rectangular linen or wool fabric with minimal cutting or sewing, and secured with ornamental clasps or pins, and a belt, or girdle ( : z≈çnƒì). Pieces were generally interchangeable between men and women.Adkins, Lesley, and Roy Adkins. Handbook to Life in Ancient Greece. New York: Facts On File, 1997. Print. However, women usually wore their robes to their ankles while men generally wore theirs to their knees depending on the occasion and circumstance. While no clothes have survived from this period, descriptions exist in contemporary accounts and artistic depictions. Clothes were mainly homemade or locally made. Additionally, clothing often served many purposes (such as bedding).Ancient Greek Dress Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì2013. Retrieved 7 October 2013. All ancient Greek clothing was made out of natural fibers. Linen was the most common fabric due to the hot climate which lasted most of the year. On the rare occasion of colder weather, ancient Greeks wore wool. Common clothing of the time was plain white, or neutral coloured, sometimes incorporating decorative borders. There is evidence of elaborate design and bright colours, but these were less common among lower class citizens. However, noble citizens wore bright colours to express their wealth as dyed clothing was more expensive. The clothing for both men and women generally consisted of two main parts: a tunic and a cloak. The Greeks had a great appreciation for the human body, and it was shown in their fashion. The fabric was expertly draped around the body, and the cloth could be slightly transparent. Males had no problem with nudity, while women could only be naked in the public bath. They typically wore purple as a sign of wealth and money as it was the most expensive flower (dye) to get hold of. History and types=Chiton Greek travelling costume, incorporating a chiton, a chlamys, sandals, and a petasos hat hanging in the back. The chiton was a simple tunic garment of lighter linen and usually pleated that was worn by both sexes and all ages. It consisted of a wide, rectangular tube of material secured along the shoulders and lower arms by a series of fasteners.Garland, Robert. Daily Life of the Ancient Greeks. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2009. Print. Chitons typically fell to the ankles of the wearer, but shorter chitons were sometimes worn during vigorous activities by athletes, warriors or slaves.Johnson, Marie, Ethel B. Abrahams, and Maria M. L. Evans. Ancient Greek Dress. Chicago: Argonaut, 1964. Print. Often excess fabric would be pulled over a girdle, or belt, which was fastened around the waist (see kolpos). To deal with the bulk sometimes a strap, or anamaschalister was worn around the neck, brought under the armpits, crossed in the back and tied in the front. A himation, or cloak, could be worn over- top of the chiton. There are two types of chitons ‚Äì Doric and Ionic, named for their similarities to the Doric and Ionic columns. The Doric chiton is \\"sleeveless\\", as sleeve technology had not really been created yet. Much like that on the caryatid above, the Doric chiton has a fold over at the top or apoptygma, is attached with fibulae at the shoulders, and is belted at the waist. Unlike the Doric Chiton, the Ionic chiton doesn't have an apoptygma, and is a long enough rectangle of fabric that when folded in half can complete a wingspan. Before shaped sleeve patterns existed the Greeks attached fibulae (ancient Greek safety pins) all the way up both arms to join the front and back top edges of the fabric. The Ionic chiton was also belted at the waist. The Doric chiton was usually made of linen and the Ionic chiton was usually made of wool. Peplos A predecessor to the himation, the peplos was a square piece of cloth that was originally worn over the chiton by women. The top third of the cloth was folded over and pinned at both shoulders, leaving the cloth open down one side. This upper part of the peplos which is folded down to the waist, forms an apotygma. Sometimes the peplos was worn alone as an alternative form of chiton. As with the chiton, often a girdle or belt would be used to fasten the folds at the waist. Himation The himation was a simple outer garment worn over the peplos or chiton. It consisted of a heavy rectangular material, passing under the left arm and secured at the right shoulder. The cloak would be twisted around a strap that also passed under the left arm and over the right shoulder. A more voluminous himation was worn in cold weather. The himation could be pulled up over the head to cover the wearer when they were overcome by emotion or shame. Chlamys The chlamys was a seamless rectangle of woolen material worn by men for military or hunting purposes. It was worn as a cloak and fastened at the right shoulder with a brooch or button. The chlamys was typical Greek military attire from the 5th to the 3rd century BCE. Undergarments Detail of a mosaic from the Villa Romana del Casale, Sicily, featuring a woman in a strophion. Women often wore a strophion, the bra of the time, under their garments and around the mid-portion of their body. The strophion was a wide band of wool or linen wrapped across the breasts and tied between the shoulder blades. Women could also wear a shawl called an epiblema. Men and women sometimes wore triangular loincloths, called perizoma, as underwear. Fasteners and buttons Since clothing was rarely cut or sewn, fasteners and buttons were often used to keep garments in place. Small buttons, pins and brooches were used. Large pins, called peronai or fibulae, were worn at the shoulders, facing down, to hold the chiton or peplos in place. Belts, sashes, or girdles were also worn at the waist sometimes replacing fasteners/buttons. Footwear Women and men typically wore slippers, sandals, soft shoes, or boots. At home they usually went barefoot. Jewellery Ornamentation in the form of jewellery, elaborate hairstyles and make-up was common for women. Small gold ornaments would be sewn onto their clothing and would glitter as they moved. The Greeks had rings, wreaths, diadems, bracelets, armbands, pins, pendants, necklaces, and earrings. Popular earring designs included: flying gods and goddesses, like Eros, Nike, and Ganymede. Patterns such as the meander symbolizing eternity was also commonly engraved into jewellery. Gold and silver were the most common mediums for jewellery, however jewellery from this time could also have pearls, gems, and semiprecious stones used as decoration. Jewellery was commonly passed down from generation to generation or made as an offering to the gods. Fabrics Ancient Greek clothing was made with silk, linen and wool. However, linen was the most common fiber due to the hot climate. The production of fabric was a long, tedious, and expensive process. It was socially accepted that textile making was primarily women's responsibility, and the production of high quality textiles was regarded as an accomplishment for women of high status. The most expensive textiles were finely woven linen and very soft wool. Expensive linen was sheer; nudity was not taboo in Ancient Greece. Less expensive and more commonly used textiles were linens woven from flax soaked in olive oil and coarse wool. Once made, the cloth was rarely cut. The seamless rectangles of fabric were draped on the body in various ways with little sewing involved. The fabric could be crinkled or pleated to give the garment more fullness, as the more fabric one wore, the wealthier they appeared. Another way of showing wealth was to use colourful dyes. People used to think the Greeks wore only white because the recovered statues from this time showed white drapery. However, they later discovered that the artwork had probably been painted and that the garments the Greeks wore were actually quite colourful. Colourful dyes were used to show wealth. Recovered sculptures from the period depicted white clothing, but research shows that such works were usually painted. Common dye colours included green, brown, grey, and yellow, while purple was only worn by the wealthy, as purple dye is expensive to produce.

Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2012-03-23 Karen Sheridan joined the band in 1993. R.O.C have released three albums (on the Virgin, Setanta and 12 Apostles labels) and 15 singles/EPs. Producer Danton Supple (Coldplay/Patti Smith) joined in 2017. Career R.O.C began with Fred and Patrick making demos on 4-track cassette, laying film dialogue over Drumatix beats and Casio keyboards. By 1993 R.O.C was Fred, Patrick, Karen Sheridan (from Denver USA), Russell Warby, and producer Peter Burgess. They released 5 singles/EPs on their Little Star label, quickly gaining critical acclaim and airplay from the likes of John Peel on UK Radio 1, and KCRW in LA. 'Girl With A Crooked Eye' made 1994's John Peel Festive 50 and earned R.O.C a session on the dj‚Äôs Radio 1 show. Their releases revealed R.O.C's disregard for genres, throwing rock, dance, spoken- word and noise influences at their evolving songs. Airing their Radio 1 session, Peel said '\\"you never know what you're gonna get next from this lot, do you? I'm all in favour of that.\\" Of the single 'God Willing' Dazed & Confused magazine said: 'pseudo-religious spoken word over ambient pop, if it was the only record R.O.C ever released it would still put them in the tope 50 best British bands'. The singles displayed a tendency to black humour. 'Girl With A Crooked Eye' is duet about domestic violence on holiday. But with their 1996 debut album, ROC, the group revealed a more personal side as Fred and Karen's vocals took centre stage. The group was now a trio of Fred, Patrick and Karen. The album was widely acclaimed: Music Week called it 'a storming debut album by this outfit who are impossible to categorise. The extraordinarily diverse set veers from electronic ambience to slick pop tunes. An early candidate for album of the year.‚Äô A single from the album ‚ÄôHey You Chick‚Äô was shot in the band‚Äôs stamping ground of Brixton, South London, the camera relentlessly following a girl‚Äôs bottom around the streets. The video opened an edition of BBC‚Äôs Top of the Pops 2, and was voted Video of the Year in Melody Maker by prankster Dennis Pennis who said: ‚Äòsomehow it‚Äôs not sexist‚Äô. The video was showcased at a music/art event staged by Dazed and Confused magazine, themed around David Cronenberg's film \\"Crash\\". R.O.C played live alongside Radiohead and Sneaker Pimps. Signing to Virgin the following year, they released the Virgin album featuring \\"Dada\\", based around Idi Amin's laugh, and \\"Said What I Said\\". Regarding \\"Ocean & England\\", Q said: \\"it ends with a love song - now that is unsettling\\". More glowing reviews followed, and endorsements from other artists. At the 1997 Q awards, Radiohead guitarist Ed O‚ÄôBrien, accepting Best Album, said he‚Äôd have nominated ‚ÄòVirgin‚Äô. The album produced two singles: ‚ÄòCheryl‚Äô made the UK singles top 75. Orbital, guest reviewers for Melody Maker, made it Single of the Week. '(Dis)count Us In‚Äô received another celebrity review, from Dannii Minogue who said: ‚ÄúThis has got the groove, hasn't it? And it's immediate too. Fantastic.\\" The video for ‚Äò(Dis)Count‚Äô, shot by Spanish director Edmundo, featured performance artist David Fryer walking through a sun-drenched Valencia, arms raised. Edmundo said the gesture meant either surrender or victory (Edmundo and Fryer previously made Everything But The Girl's video 'Single'). Despite the album's warm reception Virgin dropped R.O.C in 1999. R.O.C continued with independent releases, including \\"2000Mann\\" on the Spiky record label. They also toured the UK with Sneaker Pimps. Joining the Brooklyn-based label 12 Apostles in 2004, they were back in the recording studio with long-standing collaborators producer Danton Supple and bassist Gareth Huw Davies. Night Fold Around Me was released in June 2006. Q said: ‚ÄòIn the mid-'90s, R.O.C, like Underworld, tapped into an interesting dance/guitar hybrid. Urban paranoia and moody melody is what they do best...artistically the trio remained an intriguing fringe concern, and this belated third album sees that continuing.‚Äô A single, \\"Princess\\", was BBC 6 Music's 'Evening Single of the Week' in July 2005. The follow-up \\"Journey to the Centre of Brixton\\" made Playlouder.com's readers' poll best singles of 2005, with radio airplay including BBC Radio 1 and 6 Music (UK) and 2SER (Australia). In 2014 R.O.C‚Äôs debut album was reissued on Metal Postcard Records, including for the first time on vinyl, edited from the original 60-minute cd. Uncut said: 'Even with hindsight it‚Äôs hard to fathom what R.O.C were up to. The trio belonged to Britpop like cats belong in the sea. Disco Inferno and AR Kane might have shared their experimental drive, but neither had the same pick-and-mix approach to modern pop or their habit of skewering expectation with every song.‚Äô Discography=Albums *R.O.C.

Known as Brandywine Road, the highway runs from MD 231 at Patuxent north to U.S. Route 301 (US 301) in Brandywine. MD 381 connects Brandywine with the southeastern corner of Prince George's County and the northeastern corner of Charles County. The highway was constructed from MD 5 through Brandywine in the 1910s. MD 381 was extended southeast to MD 231 in the late 1920s and early 1930s. When MD 5 was relocated between Camp Springs and Brandywine in the mid-1950s, MD 381 was extended north along the old road to Camp Springs. The highway was rolled back to its present terminus at US 301 in the mid-1960s. The route can serve as an alternate route to the more heavily traveled MD 5 for those wanting to go from St. Mary's, Calvert, and eastern Charles counties to Brandywine. Route description View south along MD 381 at MD 382 near Aquasco MD 381 begins at an intersection with MD 231 (Prince Frederick Road) at the hamlet of Patuxent between Hughesville and the Patuxent River. The highway heads north as a two-lane undivided road to the Charles-Prince George's county line at Swanson Creek. Just north of Swanson Creek, MD 381 crosses the Herbert Subdivision of CSX's Pope's Creek Subdivision, which connects the Pope's Creek Subdivision with the Chalk Point Generating Station to the east. Road access to the power plant is provided by Eagle Harbor Road, which also serves the tiny town of Eagle Harbor. MD 381 continues through the village of Aquasco, which contains the historic homes Sunnyside and Villa DeSales and St. Mary's Rectory. The highway gradually curves northwest and meets MD 382 (Croom Road) at Poplar Hill. MD 381 passes through the village of Baden, which contains St. Paul's Parish Church, and to the east of Cedarville, which sits north of Cedarville State Forest. MD 381 completes its westward curve before entering the village of Brandywine. MD 381 has a pair of at-grade railroad crosses at two of the three corners of the wye junction of the Herbert Subdivision and the Pope's Creek Subdivision. West of the latter railroad, the highway passes the historic William W. Early House. MD 381 veers northwest just before reaching its northern terminus at US 301 (Robert Crain Highway) adjacent to Gwynn Park High School and northeast of US 301's partial interchange with MD 5 (Branch Avenue). Brandywine Road continues as a county highway northwest through the hamlet of T.B., where the highway meets the eastern end of MD 373 (Accokeek Road), the northern end of short, unsigned MD 631 (Old Brandywine Road), and intersects MD 5. Brandywine Road serves the missing movements of the US 301-MD 5 interchange, allowing access from southbound MD 5 to northbound US 301 and from southbound US 301 to northbound MD 5. History The first section of Brandywine Road to be improved was from the Pope's Creek Branch railroad crossing east to North Keys Road, which was built by Prince George's County with state aid as a gravel road in 1911. By 1921, a segment of gravel road connected the Brandywine section with the Southern Maryland Road in the hamlet of T.B. at what is today the intersection of Brandywine Road and Old Brandywine Road east of MD 5. Construction on the remainder of MD 381 began in 1929 with the construction of three sections of gravel road between Brandywine to Aquasco. All three segments were completed by the end of 1930. MD 381 was completed as a gravel road from Aquasco to its southern terminus at Patuxent in 1933. When MD 5 was relocated to its present alignment from its junction with US 301 north to north of Camp Springs in 1956, MD 381 was extended north along MD 5's old alignment on Brandywine Road and Old Branch Avenue through Clinton and Camp Springs. The portion of the state highway north of US 301 was transferred to county maintenance in 1965.

Due to this, she learned how to keep her score at zero, neither winning nor losing, a skill said to be more difficult than actually consistently winning. However, her friend from middle school, completely unaware of such circumstances, convinces her to visit the school's small mahjong club upon entering Kiyosumi High School.

Background situation By 1660, the Church of the East had become divided into two patriarchates: * the largest and oldest patriarchal see was based at the Rabban Hormizd Monastery of Alqosh. It spread from Aqrah up to Amid and Nisibis, covering in the South the rich plain of Mosul (it is known also as Eliya line). Since the 15th century its Patriarchs were appointed through an hereditary system. * the second patriarchal see was located in Khosrowa, near Salmas (from 1672 in Qochanis) and extended into the North East mountains (it is also known as the Shimun line). This patriarchal line began in 1553 when Mar Yohannan Sulaqa was consecrated bishop by the Pope in 1553, but soon it lost the connections with Rome. The last patriarch of this line recognized by the Holy See was Shimun IX Dinkha (died 1600) and later there were only few correspondences through missionaries. This See reintroduced in 1600 the heredity system for patriarchs' succession, a use unacceptable for Rome. This patriarchal line still survives in the denomination today known as Assyrian Church of the East. Life Although the town of Amid in 1553 has been the See of Yohanan Shimun VIII Sulaqa, the area of influence of the Shimun patriarchs moved soon eastward, and by 1660 the area of Amid was under the Alqosh's patriarchate. In 1667 the Capuchin missionary Jean-Baptiste de St-Aignan established there, teaching to omit the liturgical commemoration of Nestorius and to use the title Mother of God for Saint Mary. Yousip (Joseph) was born in Amid and educated by the priest 'Abd Al-Ahad. He was consecrated metropolitan bishop of Amid between 1669 and 1672, and shortly after in 1672 became Catholic. The reaction of Alqosh's patriarch Eliya X (XI) Yukhannan Maraugin was very strong: he came personally to Amid, installed a traditionalist bishop named David and had Joseph to be twice imprisoned. Joseph was released only after payment of a ransom and had to leave for Rome. When Joseph returned in 1677, the bishop David fled to Egypt and the Ottoman authorities recognized Joseph's independence and his government over the dioceses of Amid and Mardin. On June 23, 1681, arrived the formal recognition from Rome with the delivery of the pallium and the granting of the title \\"Patriarch of the Chaldean nation deprived of its patriarch\\". Thus into the Church of the East began a new patriarchal line in full communion with Rome. Falling ill, in August 1694 Joseph I left Amid for Rome, and formally abdicated in 1696. He died in Rome on Nov. 10, 1707. The life of Mar Yousip I is mainly known by his biography written in the early 18th century by 'Adb Al-Ahad son of Garabet (bishop of Amid, died 1728) and later translated into French in 1898 by J.P. Chabot.

Life Godulla's palace at Schomberg about 1860. Painting by Alexander Duncker Godulla grew up in modest conditions and went into the services to Count von Ballestrem, who promoted the intelligent, ambitious and skillful young man. In 1807, Godulla was promoted to be the manager at the count estate, and in 1818 ascended to become the overseer of all his goods. In 1812, the zinc smelter \\"Karlh√ºtte\\" construction began, and Godulla became its manager. He received from the count 28 shares (\\"freikuxen\\") in this new smelter, and this started his own business career. Soon, Godulla acquired his own coal mines, calamine mines and zinc smelters. He attained a large fortune, partly through introduction of new industrial processes into the fast developing industry of Silesia. By the time of his death, Godulla owned 80 zinc mines, 4 zinc smelters, 48 coal mines and considerable real estate. Godulla was considered to be an economic person, who lived rather in his little wooden house in Ruda Slaska than in his palace at Schomberg (Szombierki), nowadays, a subdivision of Bytom. He was also known to be very industrious man, who allowed himself little peace, and who imposed these standards on his employees and workers of his industrial establishments. He declined knighthood allegedly stating that \\"the greatest nobility comes from the memory of an actful life\\".  Legacy  Johanna and Hans-Ulrich Schaffgotsch (1908) A modern monument to Johanna Gryzik in Opole calling her \\"a Silesian Cinderella\\" Godulla remained unmarried and childless. He adopted a child of a worker, Johanna Gryzik (1842-1910), who at the age of 6 inherited Godulla's fortune, at 16 was ennobled by Friedrich Wilhelm IV to Gryzik von Schomberg-Godulla, a month later married count Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch, and then successfully administered by herself the business empire, one of the largest in Germany. After WWII, the descendants of the family were expelled from Silesia, her grave was emptied, and most of the property destroyed. A subdivision of Ruda ≈ölƒÖska (Godula, de:Godullah√ºtte) has historically been named after Carolus Godulla. Following the fall of communism, the Godula Upper-Silesian Higher Business School in Chorz√≥w was established. Godula's name was also given to a college in Ruda ≈ölƒÖska-Halemba (Zesp√≥≈Ç Szk√≥≈Ç Ponadgimnazjalnych nr 3) and a primary school in Ruda ≈ölƒÖska-Godula (Szko≈Ça Podstawowa Nr 40) and a high school in Bytom-Szombierki (Gimnazjum Nr 6). His daughter's name has recently (2007) been given to an elementary school (3) in Ruda ≈ölƒÖska (in today's Polish version, her name is spelled \\"hrabina Joanna Gryzik von Schaffgotsch\\"). Legends As a young man, Godulla was disfigured, possibly by poachers, with business of whose he successfully interfered (part of his hired job). He lost an eye, use of one hand, had a disfigured face, permanent limp, and (allegedly) lost masculinity.

Biography  Damita was born as Damita Dawn Bass on September 4, 1971 in a township of Detroit, Michigan, called Lincoln Park to parents Reverend Walter Bass and Minister Ruby Bass. Damita was born an identical twin one minute after her sister Marguerita Bass (Howard). Damita was surrounded by music in her home and her church. Her father formed their singing group \\"The Bass Family\\" consisting of her parents, her and her twin sister. To prepare for the church musical, her family rearranged and performed their own version of \\"My Country 'Tis of Thee\\". Damita's musical influences came from both her father and mother, who studied classical and choral music. Damita became more serious in her teens, when she and her sister formed a female acappella group called Adoration N Prayze in the early 1990s. Her group was invited to sing at birthday party in Indiana for a record executive. Soon after, Damita and her group were asked to sign their first record deal with the gospel record label TM Records, run by Tim Harris and Tanya Harris out of Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1991, Damita released her first record and made her entrance into the gospel industry professionally with her group Adoration N Prayze. The record, entitled \\"Time Is Running Out\\", was produced by long time friend Aaron Lindsay and Arif Martin. The album went on to receive multiple Stellar Awards nominations. Damita's first single received much recognition in industry. Entitled \\"He's Wonderful\\", it was written and arranged by her and the Adoration N Prayze project. This song caught the attention of famous music producer and director and artist Donald Lawrence, who recorded Damita's song again under the title \\"Great Things\\" on his 1995 live project \\"Bible Stories\\", which was released from Detroit-based gospel label Crystal Rose. Damita continued to work on music in the industry as well as behind the scenes. Damita became assistant Minister of Music at the Unity Cathedral of Faith church under the leadership of Bishop Clarence B. Haddon and Prophetess Joyce R. Haddon, the parents of gospel recording artist Deitrick Haddon. Damita assisted, sang, co wrote, and arranged songs, directed the choir, and worked beside Haddon. Her vocal signature was a major part of the era of the Voices of Unity (VOU). \\"Come Into This House\\" was released by Tyscot Records on March 1, 1996. Three months after the recording, Damita and Haddon were married on June 29, 1996. Damita's lead and background vocals, writing, and producing were featured on every VOU project recorded and helped promote her sound and develop her as an artist and a minister. Damita continued to faithfully serve in the ministry and was discovered in 2000 by Atlantic Records when the group was performing in Nashville, Tennessee, at an industry function. Afterward, she was asked to sign with the label. Shortly after signing, Damita's first solo project, Damita, was released in 2000. It was produced by R&B; producer NoonTime, rock artist Jim Ed Norman from the Eagles, and Arif Mardin. Her second album, No Looking Back, was released in 2008 on Tyscot Records. In 2011, Damita's mother died suddenly of a massive heart attack. Shortly after, Damita and Haddon's marriage came to an abrupt end in a messy divorce. In 2012, Damita released her third solo album and second Tyscot album, Anticipation. Currently living in Atlanta Georgia, Damita has since remarried. On May 3, 2014, Damita married Reuben Chandler, a professional photographer. The event was officiated by Donnie McClurkin. She continues to minister, encourage, and record.

Within the state of Louisiana, the highway travels from the national southern terminus at US 90 in New Orleans to the Mississippi state line south of Picayune. From Eastern New Orleans, US 11 crosses Lake Pontchartrain on the nearly Robert S. Maestri Bridge. The route parallels Interstate 10 (I-10) into Slidell, serving as that city's major north‚Äìsouth arterial. After crossing I-12, US 11 parallels I-59 to the town of Pearl River, at which point the two highways proceed concurrently across the state line. The portion of US 11 between Slidell and Pearl River was once part of the Old Spanish Trail, an early auto trail that largely became the route of US 90 when the U.S. Highway System was implemented in 1926. US 11 originally terminated in Mississippi just northwest of what is now the John C. Stennis Space Center. In 1937, US 90 was relocated onto a new route bypassing Slidell and Pearl River, significantly reducing the distance between New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. US 11 was extended into Louisiana two years later over the former alignment of US 90, and the two routes were co-signed into Downtown New Orleans. This concurrency was discontinued in 1951 with US 11 being cut back to its current southern terminus at US 90 in Eastern New Orleans. Until the construction of the Interstate Highway System in the area during the late 1950s to mid-1960s, US 11 was one of two major routes eastward out of New Orleans, the other being US 90. Both still serve as important alternate routes to I-10 when hurricanes threaten the area, as was perhaps most evident when, in August 2005, Hurricane Katrina heavily damaged the nearby I-10 Twin Span Bridge over Lake Pontchartrain, rendering the crossing completely impassable for over six weeks. (The Maestri Bridge on US 11, constructed in 1928, had sustained only minor damage.) North of Pearl River, US 11 does not serve a similar function, however, since it was moved onto I-59 in 1965 and no longer retains a separate crossing over the various branches of the Pearl River system. Route description=New Orleans to Slidell Southern terminus at U.S. Route 90 in New Orleans From the south, US 11 begins at an intersection with US 90 (Chef Menteur Highway) in Eastern New Orleans between Michoud and Venetian Isles. It heads north along Ridgeway Boulevard as an undivided two-lane highway and travels through an area of marshland known as Irish Bayou. After , the highway reaches Point Aux Herbes, where it passes through an interchange with I-10 at exit 254. US 11 immediately continues northeast onto the Robert S. Maestri Bridge, a span across Lake Pontchartrain that parallels the I-10 Twin Span Bridge. About midway across the lake, US 11 crosses from Orleans Parish (coextensive with the city of New Orleans) into St. Tammany Parish and begins to closely follow the east side of the Norfolk Southern Railway (NSRW) trestle. Making landfall in North Shore, US 11 becomes known as Pontchartrain Drive and passes through the community of Eden Isle. At Oak Harbor Boulevard, the highway enters the city of Slidell and widens to accommodate a center turn lane and a second travel lane in each direction. This portion of the highway serves as a commercial corridor for the surrounding suburban area. Slidell to Mississippi state line In Slidell, US 11 curves to the northwest and intersects LA 433 (Old Spanish Trail). The center lane disappears, and the two highways run concurrent for a short distance until reaching an intersection with Front Street. Here, US 11 turns back to the northeast alongside the NSRW tracks while LA 433 continues straight ahead across the rail line onto Bayou Liberty Road. US 11 follows Front Street through Slidell's historic district and intersects US 190 Bus. at Fremaux Avenue, beginning a brief concurrency for several blocks to a junction with mainline US 190 at Gause Boulevard. Here US 190 Bus. reaches its western terminus, and US 11 continues northward along Front Street, narrowing again to an undivided two-lane highway. Just beyond Indiana Avenue, US 11 crosses to the west side of the NSRW line via an overpass. Proceeding north for , US 11 reaches the northern limit of Slidell and enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-12 at exit 83, briefly widening to a divided four-lane highway. I-12 connects with Hammond to the west and a major interchange with I-10 and I-59 a short distance to the east. Returning to two-lane capacity, US 11 continues north through the small suburb of Alton and intersects LA 1091 (Robert Boulevard), entering the town of Pearl River. later, the highway intersects LA 41 (Watts Road), which heads north toward Bogalusa. From this intersection, LA 3081 continues north along Main Street while US 11 turns southeast onto Concord Boulevard and crosses the NSRW line at grade. Shortly afterward, US 11 enters an interchange with I-59 at exit 3, which also marks the northern terminus of LA 1090 (Military Road). US 11 turns north to follow the on-ramp to I-59 and utilizes the interstate's alignment for the remainder of its distance in Louisiana. After , I-59/US 11 reaches exit 5A, which forms the northern terminus of LA 3081 and provides another connection to Pearl River. Immediately following this interchange, the highway crosses a bridge over the West Pearl River. Just north of the bridge is exit 5B, an interchange with a local road known as Old US 11, part of the pre-interstate alignment that now serves the Pearl River Wildlife Management Area. Exiting the Pearl River corporate limits, I-59/US 11 proceeds northward through the Honey Island Swamp and, after , reaches its final interchange, exit 11 (Pearl River Turnaround). It then crosses the main branch of the Pearl River into Mississippi at a point south of Picayune. Route classification and data US 11 is generally classified as a rural or urban minor arterial by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). However, the section in Slidell between LA 433 and I-12 serves as an urban principal arterial. The annual average daily traffic (AADT) in 2016 ranged between about 18,900 vehicles near Downtown Slidell and 3,250 in Irish Bayou, south of the Maestri Bridge. The posted speed limit is generally in rural areas, reduced to between through town. The portion of US 11 utilizing the route of I-59 is classified as an urban interstate through Pearl River and as a rural interstate northward to the state line. Daily traffic volume in 2016 peaked at 29,400 vehicles, and the posted speed limit is . History=Mississippi termini US 11 was designated in November 1926 as one of the inaugural routes of the United States Numbered Highway System. The original southern terminus was located in Santa Rosa, Mississippi at a junction with US 90, the present intersection of Mississippi Highway 607 (MS 607) and Old US 11. At that time, US 90 followed the general route of US 11 through Slidell and Pearl River. After crossing the state line into Mississippi, US 90 intersected US 11 then curved back to the south, bypassing Pearlington on the way to Bay St. Louis. This route duplicated that of the Old Spanish Trail, an auto trail designated in 1916, pre-dating the numbered U.S. Highway System. Since 1921, the Louisiana portion had also carried the designation of State Route 2, as did all of US 90 throughout the state. In December 1935, the current route of US 90 running directly between the Rigolets Bridge and Pearlington was opened, shortening the distance from New Orleans to the Mississippi Gulf Coast by . Once US 90 was officially shifted onto the cutoff in June 1937, US 11 was extended south to meet it at the present intersection of MS 604 and MS 607. The following year, a second cutoff was opened, placing US 90 on its current alignment between Pearlington and MS 607 west of Waveland. US 11 was again extended to intersect US 90, following MS 604 southward into Pearlington. Extension into Louisiana In June 1939, the Louisiana Highway Commission successfully petitioned the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) to have US 11 moved onto the former route of US 90 through Pearl River and Slidell and joined with US 90 to the intersection of Canal and North Broad Streets in New Orleans. From the original southern terminus at Santa Rosa, US 11 then followed what is known as Old US 11, now a largely abandoned local road, to the state line where it crossed a now-demolished bridge over the Pearl River. It then continued onto Old US 11 in Louisiana, locally maintained today as part of the Pearl River State Wildlife Management Area, to the site of the interchange with I-59 and the current route of US 11. Continuing southwest, US 11 crossed a second demolished bridge over the West Pearl River, entering the town of Pearl River. It then followed Main Street through town, state-maintained today as part of LA 3081 and LA 3081 Spur, and rejoined the present alignment at LA 41 (Watts Road). Maps from 1939 indicate that US 11 briefly continued along the former route of US 90, turning southeast onto LA 433 to an intersection with current US 90 at the Rigolets Bridge. Including the concurrency with US 90 into Downtown New Orleans, this routing would have represented the longest expanse of US 11 in Louisiana, totaling . The permanent re-routing of US 11 as approved by AASHO became effective on . At this time, US 11 assumed its present routing across Lake Pontchartrain via the Maestri Bridge. Originally known as the Pontchartrain Bridge (or Watson-Williams Bridge, after its backers), the nearly span was opened on and initially operated as a toll bridge. The bridge was the subject of much controversy and was a hot issue in several political campaigns during the 1920s. Louisiana Governor Oramel H. Simpson successfully advocated for free bridges to be constructed for US 90 across Chef Menteur Pass and the Rigolets, and though the route was longer, the completion of the free spans in 1929 and 1930 led to the financial ruin of the toll bridge. In December 1938, the state of Louisiana purchased the Pontchartrain Bridge at auction, eliminated the tolls, and re-named it after New Orleans' mayor, Robert S. Maestri. Once US 11 was routed onto the Maestri Bridge, it continued south through Irish Bayou to its present southern terminus at US 90 and continued into town co-signed with US 90. The contemporary route of US 90 followed the current route from US 11 to Michoud; Old Gentilly Road to a point formerly known as Lee Station, where it rejoined Chef Menteur Highway; Chef Menteur Highway across the Industrial Canal and onto Gentilly Boulevard; Gentilly Boulevard to Paris Avenue; then south onto Paris and St. Bernard Avenues to North Broad Street; and finally, southwest onto North Broad Street to Canal Street. This routing of US 11 in Louisiana totaled . In May 1942, the opening of the Michoud Cutoff on Chef Menteur Highway bypassed the portion of Old Gentilly Road between Lee Station and Michoud, straightening the route of US 11-90 and eliminating two grade crossings. In 1951, the Louisiana Department of Highways eliminated several U.S. Highway concurrencies. US 51 and US 65 were removed from their concurrencies with US 61 into New Orleans, and US 11 was truncated to its present southern terminus near Irish Bayou. The number of U.S. Highway designations intersecting at Canal and North Broad Streets was thus reduced from five to two (US 61 and US 90). Interstate 59 In July 1963, construction of I-59 was completed from Pearl River northward across the Mississippi state line with the opening of the I-59 West Pearl River Bridge. The US 11 West Pearl River Bridge, originally opened in 1926, was closed due to safety reasons in 1964 and slated for demolition. US 11 traffic was detoured onto I-59 via exit 3 at LA 1090 (Military Road). This detour became permanent the following year with US 11 assuming its current routing co-signed with I-59 between Pearl River and Nicholson, Mississippi. The move was unpopular with the St. Tammany Parish police jury and with residents of Pearl River who would now have to travel several miles out of their way to reach Picayune, Mississippi. In response, the Louisiana Department of Highways reopened the bridge to local traffic only to declare it unsafe again in 1968. After further protests, the state made temporary repairs to the bridge to serve local traffic until an additional interchange was constructed to better connect the town with northbound I-59. Exit 5A on I-59/US 11 was opened in 1971 as part of LA 41 Spur (now LA 3081), and the old US 11 bridge was demolished. Aborted extensions Early expressway plans in New Orleans called for an \\"Eastern Expressway\\" branching off of US 11 at the foot of the Maestri Bridge and running parallel to US 90 toward Downman Road. During the 1950s and early 1960s, the projected route was labeled on some maps as \\"Alternate Route US 11.\\" However, this designation was dropped once plans for the Interstate Highway System progressed, and the expressway was later constructed as a section of I-10. The portion from US 11 west to Paris Road was opened on , and the portion from there west toward Downman Road was opened on . Another proposal in the 1960s was much grander in scale and called for US 11 to be extended along existing highways from New Orleans through Texas to the Mexican border. As the northern terminus of the highway has always been located at the Canadian border at Rouses Point, New York, US 11 would have been part of an international route connecting three countries. The proposed route through southwestern Louisiana was to be part of a revival and extension of an early auto trail known as the Hug the Coast Highway. Heading west from New Orleans, the route would have been concurrent with US 90 through Houma and Morgan City to New Iberia. It would then follow LA 14 to Abbeville and LA 82 to the Texas state line at Port Arthur. The route would then proceed along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico through Galveston and Corpus Christi toward the Mexican border. The Hug the Coast Highway Association worked with the Louisiana Department of Highways and the Texas Department of Transportation for over a decade to get the project off the ground. Louisiana made several improvements to its part of the route, most notably a high-level bridge across the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Vermilion Parish. A 1964 press release by the Louisiana Department of Highways indicated that the designation was anticipated by the following year and that the highway would be available for travel to the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. However, other improvements necessary to meet the standards set by the AASHTO for U.S. Highway numbering did not come to fruition, and the project fizzled during the 1970s. Future=Construction projects Several construction projects are planned or in progress for US 11. These include a $21.9 million contract to recondition the two bascule spans of the Maestri Bridge over Lake Pontchartrain. The project was begun in May 2016 and is scheduled for completion in the spring of 2021. Additionally, a project to widen US 11 to four lanes from US 190 (Gause Boulevard) to I-12 is in the preliminary stages. This will give US 11 a four- lane corridor throughout the city of Slidell. The project will necessitate the replacement of the current two-lane overpass of the Norfolk Southern Railway line, which was constructed in 1937 as part of the former State Route 2. Route realignment La DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state-owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \\"right-sizing\\" the state highway system, the portion of US 11 between US 190 (Gause Boulevard) in Slidell and LA 41 in Pearl River is proposed for deletion as it no longer meet a significant interurban travel function.

Known simply as VideoAge, it is published by TV Trade Media, Inc. Its subtitle is \\"The Business Journal of Film, Broadcasting, Broadband, Production, Distribution,\\" which was modified in 2000 from its 1981 version, \\"The Business Journal of Television.\\" It comes out seven times per year. It also publishes dailies during major international TV trade shows. It is now considered the only TV trade publication 100% devoted to the business of buying and selling content. History VideoAge was launched in 1981 by Dom Serafini, when the international television industry was still in its infancy. The magazine made its first appearance at VIDCOM, a television trade market in Cannes that was a precursor of MIPCOM. Its name was chosen because the time of its launch, 1981, was the age of video. Indeed, \\"video age\\" soon became The New York Times favorite expression to describe the foreseen 500-channel universe (of the \\"push\\" type). When VideoAge was introduced, the television sector already had five publications: Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, Broadcasting, Television/Radio Age and, in the U.K., TV World. Both \\"TV/Radio Age and TV World went out of business in the late 80s. Serafini, a former international editor of TV/Radio Age, created VideoAge with a unique formula: the key companies in the TV business fronted the money in exchange for ad pages. Among the first 20 supporting companies were MGM, MIFED, Rusconi Editori, CBN (Pat Robertson), Canale 5 (Silvio Berlusconi), ABC TV stations, Eastman Kodak and Brazil‚Äôs Globo TV. In early 1983 VideoAge introduced, at NATPE in Las Vegas, the industry‚Äôs first trade show daily (subsequently branded as The TV Executive) by using Polaroid pictures for the photo-page. This was an era without one-hour photo developing and without easily available fax machines and, in lieu of yet unfamiliar cell phones, bulky walkie-talkies and pagers were used. The yellow VideoAge T-shirts were then worn as a way to identify reporters on the trade floor. Among the first companies to support VideoAges dailies were Enter-Tel, France‚Äôs TF1 and Telepictures. Today, the concept of dailies has been rendered more valuable by online services, which, in the hectic market schedules, are limited to e-mail checking, while trade news is more convenient in the printed format. The magazine initially served an audience that tended to know more than the journalists did. They reported on events that most readers were aware of beforehand, and they could only cover the tip of the iceberg. Additionally, they had to walk a fine line and report on people and companies which were also their advertisers. The magazine began publishing dailyhttp://www.VideoAgeDaily.com issues during selected television trade markets in 1984. It opened with an office in New York, and soon expanded to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Milan. From 1987 to 1989 the editorial offices were moved to London (on 41 Gloucester Place), afterwards returning to New York City on 216 E. 75 St., the current address since it moved from the original venue on 211 E. 51 St., in 1988. There is also a branch office in Osaka, Japan. VideoAge eventually defined its topics of study along the lines of regulations, sociology, psychographics, finances, production, distribution, ratings, broadcasting, cablecasting, satellite, IPTV, piracy, as well as introductions to new technology, and attempts to make complex new technological topics digestible to non-geeks and rich technophobes. The vast majority of its current business model deals with competing with the television trade's ten other publications that cover all aspects of television, especially international TV. It also competes with many more publications which cover specialized TV fields such as mobile video, Internet- TV, cable and/or satellite TV. VideoAge was one of the first trades to enter online services in 1997, first with its English site, followed by a Spanish- language and Italian-language version. The main website contains archival issues. Archive material can also be found at archive.org.https://web.archive.org*/http://www.videoageinternational.com/web/ Current The magazine's main market is at television trade shows, where it is distributed free of charge. It does have a minute newsstand presence, and can be found in the lobby of a variety of Los Angeles hotels, especially around the time of the LA screenings. Revenue comes entirely under the form of profit from advertisers. The magazine occasionally prints with a Spanish- language section. A presence in South America is budding, and the magazine has strong ties with a Brazilian trade show in S√£o Paulo. The magazine also has a web presence, releasing occasional online press statements and videos documenting the magazine's presence at trade shows. Format VideoAge utilizes a tabloid format and prints in full color. Until 1995, it published in an A4 format. Advertisements are for the most part full-page, although the front cover ad is smaller. Articles both report business news and examine the television industry; the magazine is thus somewhat popular in universities where it is utilized as a primary reference source and object of study in a variety of classes. The scope of the magazine tends to focus more on those companies that advertise on it.

It is located on Royal York Road (formerly Church Street) at Stanley, in the Mimico neighbourhood, part of Etobicoke. It is the oldest Catholic church in Etobicoke and the only Catholic church in Mimico. History ;First church The first services were held at Eden Court (515 Royal York Rd) the home of Mr Edward Stock,Public notice - Heritage land one of only three remaining Victorian Houses on Royal York with St. Leo's Rectory, the building has recently been declared a historic building. Mr. Stock donated land for the original church\\"Etobicoke Remembered\\" by Robert A Given, Pro Familia Publishing, Toronto, Ont., Canada, 2007, Pg. 84; in 1895 which opened as a mission of Holy Family in 1903.\\"Etobicoke Remembered\\" by Robert A Given, Pro Familia Publishing, Toronto, Ont., Canada, 2007, Pg. 84; In 1909 St. Leo's became a parish serving Swansea south of the College St extension (now Morningside Ave) and Mimico with its original boundaries: Lake Ontario, the Humber River, North Queen St (now Delroy Dr) and Mimico Ave (now Kipling Ave). One of ten famous races run between athletes Tom Longboat and Alf Shrubb took place for St. Leo's parish picnic at an old Mimico park in 1912 the same year St. Leo's extensively extended the church, doubling its capacity. St. Leo's casualties for the First World War were 1 killed (Pte. Ed Doherty), 5 wounded out of 30 enlisted. In 1920 the former western portion of Mimico became the Town of New Toronto, leading in 1924 to the building of St. Teresa's Catholic Church and the separation of this area from St. Leo's. In 1923 the Town of Mimico had opened a second Public school and in 1926 the parish built St. Leo Elementary School across from the church on land bought from Mimico's Werden family which led to the creation of the Mimico Separate School Board which often met at the old Rectory, 48 Station Rd across from the Mimico Library. St. Leo Elementary School is the oldest Separate School in Etobicoke still open. Like the Town of Mimico and its other churches, St. Leo's went deeply into debt during the Great Depression. With much post war Italian immigration to the northern half of Mimico, in 1947 the Mimico Separate School Board opened a second Catholic school for the parish north of the QEW; St. Louis Elementary School the name likely suggested by the name of the pastor at the time (the first Italian-speaking pastor) Fr. Louis Markle. All of St. Leo's early clergy served at the mother church of Holy Family (except Fr. Markle, whose brother Fr. Basil Markle served there). All the early pastors but the first (Fr. Doherty) taught at St. Augustine's Seminary, a tradition carried on by the current pastor. ;Second church A new church was built across the street from the old in 1953 on the site of Mimico's 1858 post office. Shortly after, the parish made a concerted effort to buy the next door Postmaster's Home, Werden House, to be the new rectory. In 1955 St. Mark's Catholic Church was built in Humber Bay neighbourhood and in 1961 Holy Angels was built for The Queensway neighbourhood, the area having been cut off from Mimico by the building of the Queen Elizabeth Way. After liturgical changes in the Latin Rite led to the use of the vernacular (English) in place of Latin, St. Leo's began providing a separate liturgy for Italian parishioners. In 1960 a Parish Hall was built on the site of the Old Church. Both elementary schools were extensively added to throughout the 1960s as Mimico was amalgamated with Etobicoke, St. Leo's parish replacing Our Lady of Sorrows Roman Catholic Church, Kingsway as the oldest Catholic parish in Etobicoke. After full funding for Catholic Schools was introduced, the Public Board of Education offered the old Mimico High School to the Separate (Catholic) School Board which declined on the grounds that demographics changes in Etobicoke meant Mimico was no longer centrally located. Four St. Leo's parishioners have received the Sacrament of Holy Orders: Fr. Jim Passery (ordained in the church on the 50th anniversary of the parish), Deacon Ralph Yearsley,http://newsarch.rootsweb.com/th/read/YEARSLEY/2001-06/0993679928 Deacon Gord Weiss,http://www.canxsys.com/TorontoDiaconate/contact_files/Contact_September04.pdf and Deacon Alan Morris.http://bing.search.sympatico.ca/?q=toronto%20diaconate&mkt;=en- ca&setLang;=en-CA One of St. Leo's most celebrated former parishioners is NHL Hockey Player Brendan Shanahan.

Early history The ranch began in the early 19th century when an Englishman James Fay (c. 1778‚Äì1858) married a native Hawaiian woman Kaipukaikapuokamehameha Kahahana about 1828. Their daughter Mary Kaala Fay (1830‚Äì1886) had 12 children. Her second marriage was to George Kynaston Lindsey (1832‚Äì1872), who bought the land in 1858. Their oldest son Thomas Weston Lindsey (1855‚Äì1912), married Beke Fredenberg and had eight children. Thomas' oldest son William Miller Seymour Lindsey (1875‚Äì1939) married Mary Leialoha Rose. Their only daughter was Anna Leialoha. Anna Lindsey first moved to Hilo, Hawaii, but divorced her first husband Henry Lai Hipp in 1939 and moved back to the ranch to manage it. The business was heavily in debt, so she performed most of the work herself. In 1943 Anna Lindsey married James Lyman Perry-Fiske. Atypically for the time, she managed the ranch until her death in 1995. In 1968 Anna was named ‚ÄúCareer Woman of the Year‚Äù by the Hawai‚Äôi Federation of Business and Professional Women. In 1983 she was credited as the biggest individual contributor to the Hawaii American Heart Association chapter. In 2009 she became a member of the Paniolo Hall of Fame. Major buildings include a ranch house, slaughter house, barn and garage constructed between 1910 and 1930. The preserved ranch house and outbuildings have become a historic house museum. After being restored to 1939 condition, the house was opened for tours in September 2007. It was listed as site 06001120 on the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii April 28, 2008.

Schoepper and Matilda \\"Matie\\" Stehler. He began his musical training at age 7 with the violinist Alfred Perrot. He attended East High School in Rochester, and studied at the Eastman School of Music under Gustav Tinlot. He also studied violin and conducting under Andrew Polah at Syracuse University. Career Schoepper joined the U.S. Marine Band in 1934, playing violin and saxophone. He often appeared as a violin soloist on network radio programs and was named concert master of the Marine Chamber Orchestra. He first conducted at the White House in 1942. He spent 38 years with the band. He joined the band as an enlisted man in 1934, playing violin and saxophone, and became the first Marine Band director to reach the rank of full colonel. Schoepper performed as a soloist and conductor before royalty and heads of state and government at hundreds of White House engagements. His first White House appearance as conductor in 1942 before King George II of Greece. Later, when the White House was being renovated, he conducted all the Blair House engagements for Harry S. Truman. In 1955 Schoepper replaced William F. Santelmann as Marine Band Director. Schoepper directed \\"The President's Own\\" (as the Marine Band is known) at the inaugurations of Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard M. Nixon. Schoepper was in charge of the band for 17 years. He took the full band on 18 concert tours, during which he estimated that it played before some 12 million people. Schoepper also served as music adviser to the White House. He helped organize soirees with the country's finest artists and appearances of its most popular performers. During the Johnson presidency, members of the White House social staff, as the story is told, had a \\"frank exchange of views\\" because they considered Schoepper too indulgent of Johnson's passion for the foxtrot, neglecting other rhythms that his dancing guests might have favored. Later life and death For his last performance at the White House, Schoepper led the Marine Chamber Orchestra at a reception for retiring members of Congress. Once the final chord faded, Nixon introduced him and toasted him as the guests stood and saluted. Schoepper died July 29, 1997, in Alexandria, Virginia, of pneumonia, weeks after experiencing a stroke that he never recovered from.Rochester Democrat and Chronicle (July 31, 1997)The New York Times (August 9, 1997) References 1914 births 1997 deaths American male conductors (music) Syracuse University alumni White House staff 20th-century American conductors (music) 20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Albert F.

He was born in 1908 in the city of Shkod√´r in a noble family of the time. In his honour the sports arena of Shkod√´r is now called Qazim Dervishi Sports Palace.  Life  Dervishi was born in Shkod√´r, on June 10, 1908. Since his childhood he had a passion for all kinds of sports and he practiced football and basketball during his teenage years. In 1924 he entered the \\"Harry Fultz\\" Technical School in Tirana. The motto of the school at that time was \\"If we rest we rust\\" (). After finishing school he started teaching basketball and he started training a team in Shkod√´r. He is known as the \\"man who brought basketball from Technical School\\" because of the popularity he gave the sport in his native city. In 1930 he was named headmaster of the \\"Malet Tona\\" campus in Shkod√´r. In 1939 he was transferred to the city of Pogradec to work as a teacher but came back to Shkod√´r in 1942. Just three years after, he was named president of the sportive society KS Vllaznia. In the years 1946-1947 he transferred to Gjirokast√´r where he taught the local youths the sport of basketball for the first time. During 1947 he worked in the Peqin-Kavaje railway as an instructor on physical education. That is where he was arrested by the communist government because of his sympathy to ex-King of Albanians Ahmet Zogu. This was influenced from the fact that he had studied in the \\"Harry Fultz\\" Technical School where most of the dissidents of the communist regime had studied. A 22-month investigation was made from the \\"Sigurimi\\" that \\"found enough proofs\\" to declare him guilty of propaganda against the communist regime. He was punished with a sentence of 18 years but he served only until 1954 because of very bad health conditions. He was paralyzed and he managed to get a paralysis financial assistance. In 1993, he was given the title \\"The Nation's Teacher\\" for his contribution in sports. In 2009 the Council of the Municipality of Shkoder accorded to him the title \\"Honorary Citizen\\". He died in January 1994 in the age of 86 years, honored from the Albanian people.  Sporting activities  As soon as Dervishi went for studies in Tirana, he started taking part in the sportive activities that were held in the school and often was named among the excellent students in sports. He practised and contributed in athletics, basketball, football, etc. It should be mentioned that in an interview of Master Irfan Tershana, it is stated that Qazim was also one of the best baseball players of the Technical School.  Athletics  From left to right: Ragip Lohja, Ahmet Ashikja, Qazim Dervishi, Ibrahim Dizdari and Fehti Dizdari His athletics career started when he entered the Technical School in Tirana. From 1924 to 1928 he took some first and second prizes in the annual Olympic Games that were held in Tirana. He had his best results in high jump, pole vault and triple jump where he became national champion. In 1929 he was invited to join his hometown club, Bashkimi Shkodran for the first athletics championship in Albania. The team from Shkod√´r (the photo on the right) became national champions, having even Qazim's help. In the National Athletics Championship taken place in Tirana at 1930 he secured the first place in triple jump with a result of 12.22 meters. He improved his result to 12.41 meters in the triple jump, which secured him another first place in the National Athletics Championship of 1933.  Football  From left to right: Kin Bushati (goalkeeper) Ernest Halepiani, Gjelosh Gjeka, Pjeter Gjoka, Qazim Dervishi (captain), Muhamet Halili, Asim Golemi, Luigj Radoja, Gjon Kiri, Myzafer Pipa, Hile Staka, Luigj Shala (coach) Even though Dervishi was a multiple champion in athletics, he had great success as a footballer. In fact, the school's vice-director Williams B. Juillirat chose him as a permanent advisor in football along with Spiro Kristo in baseball and Vangjel Qirio in basketball. Dervishi had success in football in the right wing as a right wing attacker. In 1929 he was called from SK Durr√´s football club to play in an international friendly match versus US Bari, of Italy, in that time a Serie A team. For the next ten years, until 1939, he would play with Bashkimi Shkodran (the photo on the right) and would become a key member of the team. He is also the scorer of the first goal ever in the Kategoria e Pare e Topkembes, scored against SK Tirana. After ending his career he started training youths in Shkod√´r and learning them to play football. To finalise his work with the youths of Shkod√´r he organized for the first time in Shkod√´r the local youths championship with kids coming from the city's schools. In this championship were discovered football talents that would later give Vllaznia the title. Some of the players discovered were Muhamet Dibra, Pal Mirashi, Bahri Kavaja, Hamdi Bakalli, and Xhevdet Shaqiri.  Basketball  The first ever official basketball match in Albania was played on March 2, 1928 between the Technical School and the \\"Malet Tona\\" campus. For the Technical School captain was Qazim Dervishi. The match was won from the boys of the Technical School with the result of 32-14. In 1929 he is named headmaster in the \\"Malet Tona\\" campus in Shkod√´r. Even here along with the headmaster duties, Dervishi gave a primary importance to the sports practising. After a year of training, on June 27, 1930 was held the first basketball match in the city of Shkod√´r between the local team of the \\"Malet Tona\\" campus and the \\"Naim Frasheri\\" club from Tirana. The match was played in a regular size field and for the first time in Shkod√´r were put the baskets. Dervishi was the referee for this game, which ended in a tie. In the years 1933-1934, in the Perash elementary school where he was working (the only mixed school at that time) he started the women's basketball which became also popular.  Career as a referee  After 1939, Dervishi took another direction, that of a referee and of the director of the physical education. In this year he finishes a 3-months training to classify himself as a referee. On February 22, 1946 he presided the first ever international match between Albania and Montenegro. He also was the only Albanian referee in the 1946 Balkan Games where the Albanian national football team won the championship. He presided a match as the main referee (Yugoslavia-Bulgaria, 2-1) and another one as a linesman (Albania-Romania, 1-0).

He came to prominence beginning in 2003 in Zhejiang province, and served as the President of the provincial High Court. He served as the head of the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee before he became deputy party secretary of Shanghai. He became the mayor of Shanghai in January 2017. On February 12, 2020, Ying was appointed Party secretary of Hubei, replacing Jiang Chaoliang during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Career  Ying was born in Xianju County, Zhejiang province, near the city of Taizhou. He joined the Communist Party of China in April 1979. He holds law degrees from the China University of Political Science and Law and Hangzhou University. He began his career in Huangyan County, Zhejiang, working for the county industry bureau and the local police station. He then served as the mayor of the town of Chengguan (). He successively worked his way up the bureaucratic hierarchy in Taizhou, heading its public security department, then its Political and Legal Affairs Commission (Zhengfawei). He then became the police chief and Zhengfawei head of neighboring Shaoxing.Â∫îÂãáÁÆÄÂéÜ, Zhongguo Jingji Wang May 4, 2014 Ying was promoted to the provincial government in 1995, serving as the deputy provincial police chief, then the head of the provincial office for combating illegal drugs, and the leader of an effort to combat terrorism. In July 2003, Ying was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, and several months later the concurrent head of the provincial Department of Supervision. At the time, Xi Jinping was the provincial party secretary. As such, Ying has been named by political observers as a member of the \\"New Zhijiang Army.\\" In November 2006, Ying was named President of the Zhejiang Provincial High Court. In January 2008, Ying became President of the Shanghai High Court. In April 2013, Ying was named the head of the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and a member of the municipality's Party Standing Committee. In June 2014, he was named deputy party secretary, overseeing party affairs and the municipal party school. In September 2016, he further obtained the office of vice-mayor. This was considered highly unusual, as deputy party secretaries do not usually hold deputy government positions simultaneously. The move was therefore was interpreted as grooming Ying for higher office, likely the future mayor of Shanghai. On 20 January 2017, Ying Yong was elected as mayor of Shanghai. Ying was the first mayor since Zhu Rongji to have spent the majority of his career outside of the municipality. Observers have noted that Ying is likely slated for further promotion. In 2017 he was elected a full member of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Ying was a delegate to the 18th Party Congress, and a delegate to the 11th and 12th National People's Congress. On February 12, 2020, Ying was appointed Party secretary of Hubei, replacing Jiang Chaoliang during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At that time, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Louis Anquetin, Eug√®ne Boch and Paul Tampier (1859‚Äì1940) were studying with Cormon.Lit. A Sourcebook of Gauguin's Symbolist Followers ..., pp. 159-172 At P√®re Tanguy's shop, he first saw some of C√©zanne's paintings. Toulouse- Lautrec and Anquetin introduced young Bernard to Montmartre's night life. In 1885, Bernard created his first important work, the woodblock La Nativit√©. 1886 After having been expelled by Cormon for insubordinate behaviour in early spring, 1886, his parents tried to convince him to work in business, which he refused. Financially supported by the parents, Bernard instead went on a foot trip to Brittany. Recommended by Claude-√âmile Schuffenecker, whom he had met at Concarneau, he went to Pont-Aven in July, to see Paul Gauguin who however at first did not recognize Bernard's talent. Returned home after two months, he moved in with his parents, visited the exhibition of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants and saw the work of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. *April/September: on a foot trip to and through Brittany. Leaving Paris on April 6, bernard arrives via Nonancourt and Verneuil in Saint-Briac, at the end of the month in Le Ribay. The second half of May he spends in Cancale, June in Saint-Briac. Via Saint-Brieuc, Tr√©guier, Morlaix, Landerneau, Pougastel-Daoulas, Douarnenez, Le Faou√´t, Quimper and Concarneau he arrives in Pont-Aven. Lorient, Carnac, Auray, Vannes and Rennes are the final places he visits, before he is back to Paris/Asni√®res - evidently before the closing of the exhibition of the Ind√©pendants: *August 21: Opening of the 2nd exhibition of the Artistes Ind√©pendants; running through September 21. 1887 When his parents rented a house in Asni√®res, √âmile was able to exhibit pointillist works there, early in the year, and was invited by Seurat to visit his studio. Bernard and Anquetin however soon decided to break with Neo-Impressionism and go their own way, painting flat colour areas but strong black contours. At Tanguy's, Bernard met Lucien Pissarro and Charles Angrand at that time. In spring, he returned to Brittany and stayed two months in Saint-Briac-sur-Mer, where he created stained glass windows. After his grandmother started to live with the family, they moved to a bigger house and built a studio for √âmile. *December/January (?): Vincent van Gogh arranges an exhibition of paintings by himself, Bernard, Anquetin, Koning and (probably) Toulouse-Lautrec in the Restaurant du Chalet, 43 Avenue de Clichy, on Montmartre.

Due to Paris World's Fair held at the centennial of the French Revolution, Schuffenecker got the chance to expose works of himself and other avantgarde painters (which was part of the Fair, where only pieces admitted by a jury would have been shown). As Armand Guillaumin and Theo van Gogh (Vincent's manager) were disappointed by the way the exhibit was promoted, they withdrew. Others however joined, and Bernard took the chance to expose 23 works, plus two more under the pseudonym Ludovic Nemo. *July 27: Le Moderniste, edited by Albert Aurier, prints Bernard's first art critical statement.√âmile Bernard, : Le Moderniste I/14, 27 July 1889, pp. 108 and 110 :As his father prohibited him to visit Gauguin in Pont-Aven, he spent the summer in St. Briac, where he met one Charlotte Buisse whom he had liked to marry, but was repelled by her father for not being able to maintain a family. *October 4: Bernard is back to Asni√®res.Theo van Gogh: Letter T18 to his brother Vincent, 4 October 1889 :He afterwards went to Lille, stayed with his grandmother and worked as a textile designer for a while. 1890 After returning to Paris, Bernard had to find out that Charlotte was meanwhile engaged to someone else.

Bernard was supported by Count Antoine de La Rochefoucauld and Andries Bonger. He first travelled Italy: On visits in Genova, Pisa, Rome and Florence he admired Perugino, Botticelli, Giotto, Simone Martini, Taddeo Gaddi and Fra Angelico. When meeting Dal M√©dico, a fellow from Pont-Aven, he decided to accompany him to Constantinople via Samos. There, he got the commission to paint the chaple of Les Missionnaires de Lyon. He afterwards moved on to Smyrna, where Maria left him for a French photographer. Via Jerusalem and Alexandria, he arrived in Cairo by the end of the year. There, he had some income from decorating the chapel of the P√®res de la Mission africaine de Lyon, but still was supported by Bonger and de La Rochefouauld. 1894 Married Hann√©nah Saati, of Libanese descent, on July 1 and started living like an Arab, whilst reading Fathers of the Church (St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas) and philosophers like Hegel, Aristotle and Plato, for becoming inspired. Still was, to some extent, supported by his family. To the 5th album of Andr√© Marty's L'Estampe originale, he contributed a print. 1895 Bernard's first son, Otse, was born. The painter was commissioned with frescoes for the chapel of Cairo's Cath√©drale de la Vierge and looked for inspiration in Michelangelo's oeuvre. His sister Madeleine, terminally ill with tuberculosis, moved to Cairo, where she died on November 19. 1896 For their difficult financial situation, the family moved to Spain, reaching Granada in August and Seville in December. Hann√©nah became ill of tuberculosis. 1897 In spring, Bernard met Spanish painter Zuloaga; after the birth of a second son, Fortunato, they moved back to Cairo to live with Hann√©nah's family. Both sons died of tuberculosis, soon later. 1898 Birth of a third son, Odilon. Bernard participated at the Salon de l'Art Religieux and published the first one of 17 volumes of poetry.

La R√©novation esth√©tique was founded to propagate increasingly reactionary Catholic points of view. He from now mostly travelled between Paris and Tonnerre and produced a vast output of art critic's essays, poems, plays, book illustrations, but also paintings (towards 1910, mainly landscapes). Around 1907, he visited Andries Bonger in the Netherlands and portrayed him and his wife. In 1908, he exposed three of his paintings at the Post-Impressionist exhibition in Prague, having been invited by Milos Marten, who admired his art. In 1910, he had a whole room in the Mus√©e Baudouin (Paris) to exhibit his Orientalist work. At that time, working on his career, he was hardly concerned about Andr√©e and the children. In December 1911, heirship after his father's death allowed him a better life. 1910s *1910: Bernard's friend Eug√®ne Boch moves to his new house Villa La Grimpette \\"La Grimpette, house of Eug√®ne Boch\\" in Monthyon - √âmile Bernard becomes a fr√©quent guest to this house. *1913‚Äî1921: Bernard showed some of his woodcuts at the Circle des librairies, in 1913.

He was the third son of Henry I the Bearded, Duke of Wroclaw, by his wife (and later Saint) Hedwig, daughter of Berthold IV, Duke of Merania. Life Little is known about his early years. The death of his older brother Boles≈Çaw in 1208 left him in the second place over the Silesian inheritance, after his brother and new heir Henry II the Pious. He died very young after a fall from his horse during a hunt and was buried in Trebnitz, where his sister Gertrude was the Abbess. Prince Konrad was the hero of the first alleged ethnic conflict between the Polish and Germans in Silesia. According to an anonymous Silesian monk, the author of the \\"Polish-Silesian Chronicle\\" from the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, Henry I the Bearded tried to leave all his inheritance to Henry II the Pious. This led in a quarrel between the brothers, which degenerated in an open conflict with the passive attitude of their parents. In this dispute, the young Konrad had the support of the Polish, and Henry II gained the favour of the Germans. As a result, both forces clashed in the Battle of Studnica near Opole in 1213, the Germans under the leadership of Henry II defeated the Polish troops of Konrad. The chronicles suggest that Konrad's fatal accident shortly after wasn't coincidental. Thanks to this information, by the 19th and early 20th century, Prince Konrad became a Polish national hero. Historiography recognized the Battle of Studnica as a breakthrough event for Polish Silesia. The Silesian writer Jan Miko≈Çaj Jaro≈Ñ created a 1920 drama with the title Konrad the Curly. In 1928, Leon Schiller developed the Silesian Drama at the beginning of the 13th century in five acts. As a defender of the Prince, Zofia Kossak-Szczucka wrote Legnickie Pole in 1931. Konrad's brother and antagonist, Henry II the Pious, was recognized as pro-German.

The gallery's director was Richard Bellamy, and its financial backer was the art collector Robert Scull. Green Gallery is noted for giving early visibility to a number of artists who soon rose to prominence, such as Yayoi Kusama, Mark di Suvero, Donald Judd, and George Segal. History Prior to starting the Green Gallery, Bellamy was co-director of the Hansa Gallery, an artists' cooperative gallery in New York's 10th Street gallery district that had moved uptown. He brought his deep connections with downtown artists with him to his new enterprise, which joined a small number of uptown galleries focused on new American art. These included Leo Castelli (founded only a few years before Green) and the somewhat older Sidney Janis and Stable Galleries. The genesis of the Green Gallery was Robert Scull's interest around 1959 in discovering and securing works by new artists directly, without having to deal with a gallery. While he had been making time to visit studios, he had a business to run and believed a gallery of his own would enable him to reap the benefits of this kind of research without the investment of time. He initially approached Ivan Karp to run the gallery, and Karp referred him to Bellamy. Scull was a silent backer of the business, in order not to interfere with his relationships with other galleries. While the Green Gallery was not a commercial success, it was distinguished by Bellamy's wide-ranging taste and his presentation of artists working in directions that soon became recognized as vital trends. The gallery's short history spanned a vibrant period in the New York art world; it showcased a diverse group of artists who were giving shape to styles that would soon be labeled Color Field painting, Pop Art and Minimalism. Notable artists Artists receiving important first shows at the Green Gallery during its five-year run included: Mark di Suvero, Lucas Samaras, James Rosenquist, Claes Oldenburg (first uptown show), George Segal (first show as a sculptor), Robert Morris, Donald Judd (first show as a sculptor), Larry Poons and Dan Flavin. Although Bellamy did not represent Andy Warhol, Green was the first American gallery to exhibit one of his Pop paintings, 200 One Dollar Bills (1962), included in a 1962 group show. The gallery also presented the work of artists such as Tom Wesselmann, Alfred Leslie, Milet Andrejevic, Robert Beauchamp, Neil Williams, Philip Wofford, Ralph Humphrey, Ronald Bladen, Richard Smith, Sally Hazelet Drummond, Pat Passlof, and Tadaaki Kuwayama. Other artists who exhibited in group exhibitions there included Kenneth Noland, Ellsworth Kelly, Yayoi Kusama, Frank Stella, John Chamberlain, Daniel Spoerri, George Brecht, Miles Forst, Walter Darby Bannard, Robert Whitman, Julius Hatofsky, Burgoyne Diller, Myron Stout, Richard Stankiewicz, Lester Johnson, James Lee Byars, Sidney Tillim, Charles Ginnever, Anthony Magar, Felix Pasilis, Alice Mason, H.C.

He introduced the four three quarters system, playing at centre-three- quarter. He played for Cardiff, the Barbarians, the London Welsh, Richmond, Blackheath and Llanelli. He played for the Welsh national side on three occasions in the Home Nations Championship. His debut was on 6 February 1892 against Scotland. His other two appearances were against England, once in 1893 (the season when Wales first won the Triple Crown) and again in 1894. Rees taught at Sherborne School, Rossall School and Giggleswick School, before spending the last thirty years of his life working as a teacher in India. He died on 30 August 1932.

Commonly of Bronze Age origins, these cairns may be part of a cairnfield (a collection of closely spaced cairns) where some cairns might be funerary.Keys to the Past Glossary.English Heritage Dictionary Clearance cairns are a worldwide phenomenon wherever organised agriculture has been practised.Clearance cairns in Palestine.  Purpose of clearance  ard A reconstructed mould board plough. By removing large and moderate size stones from the surface and sub- surface, ploughing can take place with much less potential damage taking place to the plough blade. Stones also prevent the growth of plants where they physically block access to the soil and their removal allows for a greater surface area for crops to grow and to allow for plants to grow to their full potential; Stones also increase drainage and may therefore deprive plants of moisture. Stones were removed from fields to allow for the efficient use of hand tools, animal powered machines on such fields in the past and for tractors, etc. in more recent times. Some prehistoric clearance cairns may also contain burials.Warwickshire Time Trail A few clearance cairns may have been additionally created as boundary markers.The Cairns of Dartmoor As ploughing developed and specialised the greater depth tilled and the increased power of mechanised ploughing resulted in more and larger stones being brought to the surface and these too had to be removed. A typical walled garden where the stone acts as a slow release radiator Field clearance cairns sometimes survive long after cleared fields have fallen out of use and are often the only surviving evidence of past agricultural activity in areas of woodland, upland areas, etc. The existence of these cairns was once regarded as suggesting pastoral farming. Many now consider them the result of arable or mixed agricultural exploitation enabling ploughing or hand tillage to work more efficiently.  Heat radiation  The possibility exists that the stone piles were built in the middle of the enclosures, with an additional purpose of maximising the effects of daytime radiance; the holding in of heat caught during the day, and its release at night would increase the temperature of the field very slightly. This effect would encourage crop growth and reduce the risk of frost.Archaeology of Pembrokeshire Walled gardens produce the same effect.  Creation  A mound associated with a bog-wood and a clearance cairn at Eglinton Country Park. Bog-wood associated with a clearance cairn. Many clearance stones were used in the construction of defensive structures, houses, farm buildings, walls, drainage ditches, road metalling, etc. Where permanent clearance cairns were formed it was predominately on waste land, such as steep slopes, edges of woodland, field corners, and around earth-fast boulders. The amount of stone which needed to be cleared from fields depended upon the local geology, glacial deposits, glacial erratics, etc. Many cairns are mainly composed of stones which could have been carried by a single person who would have followed the plough as it turned up small boulders, etc. Some surviving cairns are of considerable antiquity as field clearance has been practised since the beginnings of agriculture in the Stone Age, such as at the Gardberg site in Vestre Slidre, Oppland, Norway. A Bronze Age origin for clearance cairns is more common.  Characteristics  Ard or plough-marks on a boulder in a clearance cairn Ard-marks on a boulder in a clearance cairn at Eglinton Country Park A clearance cairn formed using mechanised extraction A recent clearance cairn devoid of lichen and moss growth Cairns may be discrete, in large groups (cairnfields) or as linear formations‚Äîlinear cairns. Many stones in clearance cairns show plough-marks or ard-marks at various angles to each other, typical of the Bronze Age ploughing methods.Ard-marks at Cladh Hallan These ard-marks indicate that the boulders were obstructing the ploughing process and were in situ for some time before removal. Other items such as bog-wood and grubbed out tree stumps were sometimes added to the cairns as a result of tree felling and the process of creation of pasture from woodland. Bog-wood stumps and trunks can be thousands of years old, are darker in colour due to the tannins from the peat and do not show typical wood decomposition characteristics due to their preservation within peat bogs. The absence of saw marks indicates felling using axes, providing further information about the age of the wood involved. Some clearance cairns are linear in form. Many of the smaller cairns were probably created by family groups, whilst larger ones would have required organised labour.Construction of cairns. Cairnfields have on occasions been confused with various other classes of monuments, such as round barrow cemeteries and groups of round barrows, stone hut circles, ring cairns, or burnt mounds. In general round barrows are larger, more regular, and may contain visible traces of a cist or kerb; stone hut circles have distinct entrances; ring cairns have a hollow centre; and burnt mounds contain a high proportion of fire-crazed stones of rather smaller size than appear in the average clearance cairns within cairnfields. Natural deposits such as so called 'clitter agglomerates',Clitter cairns. moraines can also on occasion look rather similar to groups of clearance cairns, but their context, position and regular form usually betrays their true origins.Monument Class descriptions Clearance cairn material is often heterogeneous, typically consisting of both edged and rounded small stones, sometimes mixed with sand, clay or silt, lifted from the field nearby. Agricultural and clearance cairns are sometimes located on slopes, whilst burial cairns rarely are.Burial Cairns in Finland Clearance cairns constructed using mechanised methods with horse or motor powered assistance may appear superficially similar, however the stones are generally much larger and they are more randomly tipped rather than hand placed.  Natural history  Due to the age and 'abandoned' state of many clearance cairns they are often good sites for the growth and survival of lichens, mosses, ferns and other plants; the actual species being dependent on the rock type. Cairns are relatively undisturbed and emulate old walls for the micro-habitats they produce.Plants on cairns.  Landscape history  In some areas which are now unproductive moorland, aerial photographs show the presence of numerous prehistoric clearance cairns and associated dwellings such as hut-circles. This clear evidence of previous ancient habitation and cultivation shows that the climate worsened until the farmers were forced to move to lower ground.Wickham-Jones, C. R. (2009), The Landscape of Scotland. Stroud : The History Press. . pp. 48 ‚Äì 50.  Stone carrying  Stone carry or the stone walk is a traditional Scottish athletic event involving the carrying of large stones down the field of competition; the competitors pick up two heavy stones with iron handles, and carry the pair as far as they can. The sport may have grown out of the act of clearing stones from fields to create pastures and arable land.

It was first published in a 1951 issue of Weird Tales. Synopsis As the title implies, the entire text is that of a notebook found in an empty house. The notebook is written by Willie Osborne, a farm boy who had lived with his grandmother until she died. During the time he lived with his grandmother, she told him about entities she called \\"them ones\\", which apparently live in the mysterious forest around the farm that his Aunt Lucy and Uncle Fred own. ‚ÄúThem ones‚Äù seem to be most active during Halloween, as Willie‚Äôs grandmother claims people have heard the sound of drums coming from the forest at that time. After his grandmother‚Äôs death, Willie goes to live with his aunt and uncle. His ideas about strange beings inhabiting the forest are supported by the fact that his aunt and uncle always lock the doors at night and never enter the woods after dark. Even more strangely, the forest seems to be devoid of animal life. Willie thinks the answer is that a cult of Druids, possibly having come over from before the time of Columbus, lives in the woods. In October, Willie has a disquieting experience in the forest. Late in the day, he hears something coming towards him. Hiding behind a rock, Willie smells an awful stench and hears an unearthly voice say something in an equally unearthly language, in which is the word \\"shoggoth\\" and the sounds \\"shub nigger ath\\". Willie investigates the spot where the entity went by and discovers what appear to be hundreds of hoof marks and a foul-smelling slime, not unlike that which comes out of a mysterious old well on the farm. For many nights after, he dreams of the creature that made the hoof-prints. Things take a turn for the worse as Halloween nears. Willie‚Äôs cousin, Frank, was supposed to come visit for Halloween. When the buggy that Fred went out in to bring him to the farm comes back empty, Lucy faints. A few days later, on Halloween, Lucy disappears herself. When Willie tries to escape, the situation is compounded when a man claiming to be Cousin Osborne shows up, saying that he did not arrive earlier due to business. Willie explains to him the situation, wisely leaving out his experience in the woods and his idea of what might be out there. When Osborne shows knowledge of Willie‚Äôs experience anyway, and claims to be from Arkham when Willie knows him to be from Kingsport, it becomes obvious that he is an impostor. Cousin Osborne, claiming to have custody of Willie, orders him to stay indoors. Later, when the mailman, Cap Pritchett, arrives, the fake Osborne insists that Willie is not home. Willie immediately shows himself and asks to be ridden into town. Pritchett, seeing that Cousin Osborne was lying about Willie‚Äôs presence, agrees to Willie‚Äôs request. Cousin Osborne warns Willie as he leaves that he is making a mistake. As Pritchett and Willie go some way, Willie tells him about the recent going-ons and asks Pritchett if he knows what a shoggoth is. When Pritchett tries to answer, a black, log-like creature appears in the road and attacks the horse, pulling Pritchett out as he identifies it as a shoggoth. Willie escapes and comes to a clearing where he sees a cult of people he presumes to be the Druids sacrificing cattle, as well as some people, on an enormous rock with two enormous black marks on its sides. The shoggoth reappears, the same from Willie's nightmares. More terrified than ever, Willie runs away, screaming, and ends up back at the house. He barricades himself inside and writes most of the titular notebook. The next day, Willie sees Cousin Osborne talking to someone, speaking of getting into the house through an unused well in the backyard, which Willie realizes is an entrance to the underground world where the \\"Druids\\" live. The last thing he writes is \\"The door is banging o‚Äì\\" Chaosium The log-like creatures in Bloch's story were identified as shoggoths. Gaming company Chaosium, the creators and publishers of the Call of Cthulhu horror role- playing game, which is based on the works of Lovecraft and other Mythos authors, used the creatures in the Call of Cthulhu bestiary as depicted by Bloch, but identified them as the progeny of Shub-Niggurath (so-called Dark Young) in order to add more monsters to its gaming lines.Notebook Found in a Deserted House Danial, 9 Mar 2009  References External links * Cthulhu Mythos short stories Fictional diaries 1951 short stories Fantasy short stories Works originally published in Weird Tales Works by Robert Bloch ","title":"Notebook Found in a Deserted House"},{"id":"21357515","text":"Bengt Gunnar Malmsten (20 March 1922 - 20 December 1996) was a Swedish speed skater who competed in the 1952 Winter Olympics and in the 1956 Winter Olympics.

His father succeeded as Polish high duke in 1238, ruling over Silesia and the Seniorate Province, as well as over large parts of Greater Poland.

As contemporary chroniclers called Mieszko with the surname \\"of Lubusz\\" (lubuski), it seems possible that his older brother Boles≈Çaw, while assuming the rule over Silesia, had to cede him the Greater Polish territories of Lubusz as a separate district, probably by the will of their late father.

He provided numerous first hand accounts of American art, beginning with abstract expressionism in the 1950s, where he managed the Tanager Gallery downtown and co-ordinated the New York artists' ZT 'Club' of the New York School from 1955 to its demise in 1962Sandler, 2003. as well as documenting numerous conversations from the Cedar Street Tavern and other artists venues. Sandler saw himself as an impartial observer of this period, as opposed to polemical advocates such as Clement Greenberg or Harold Rosenberg. Biography Sandler was a child of Eastern European Jewish immigration. His father was an advocate of socialism. Sandler was born in Brooklyn, his family next relocated to Winnipeg, and finally to Philadelphia.By Robert Storr 7th June 2018 The Art Newspaper \\"Remembering Irving Sandler\\" He served with the U.S. Marine Corps for three years in the Second World War. He received a bachelor's degree from Temple University in 1948, and a master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1950. He did some additional graduate work at Columbia University, but ultimately finished a doctoral degree at New York University much later, in 1976. He started writing art criticism at the behest of Thomas B. Hess for ARTNews in 1956, and was a senior critic there through 1962. He has taught at several universities, including the Pratt Institute, New York University, and the State University of New York at Purchase, where he was appointed a founding professor in the School of Art+Design (then called the Visual Arts Division) in 1972, and where he remained until his retirement. Sandler curated several critically acclaimed exhibitions including the \\"Concrete Expressionism Show\\" in 1965 at New York University, which featured the work of painters Al Held and Knox Martin and the sculptors Ronald Bladen, George Sugarman and David Weinrib,Sandler, 2006. and \\"The Prospect Mountain Sculpture Show\\" in 1977.Sandler, 2003. \\"The Prospect Mountain Sculpture Show\\" was held at Lake George in Upstate New York overlooking David Smith's Bolton Landing residence in 1977. Many American artists were interviewed by Sandler, including first generation abstract expressionists such as Robert Motherwell, Willem DeKooning, Phillip Guston, and Franz Kline. in 1957 and later pop protagonists such as Tom Wesselmann in 1984. In the 1972 with Trudie Grace he co-founded Artists Space, which helped launch the careers of Judy Pfaff, Barbara Kruger and Cindy Sherman amongst others.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/02/obituaries/irving-sandler-dead-art- critic.amp.html As indicated in the bibliography below, Sandler authored several monographs on individual artists as well as a sweeping, four-volume survey of \\"postmodern art\\" (The Triumph of American Painting: A History of Abstract Expressionism (1970), The New York School: The Painters and Sculptors of the Fifties (1978), American Art of the 1960s (1988), and Art of the Postmodern Era: From the Late 1960s to the Early 1990s (1996).). Robert Storr has described the history, \\"Narrative, untheoretical--at times antitheoretical --and unapologetically focused not just on what happened in the United States but principally on what happened in Manhattan, Sandler's surveys have been widely criticized but even more widely used, not least because they are readable and deeply informed by their author's unrivaled access to the artists and art-worldings about whom he writes.\\" Storr's article is a review of Sandler's 2003 memoir, A Sweeper-up After Artists. Sandler continued to write on art during his final years and was concerned with allowing certain aspects of New York painting to be reassessed, as with his work on Esteban Vicente (2007). In 2009 he published Abstract Expressionism and the American Experience: a Reevaluation.

Produced by Lime Street Productions for ITV, it starred Samantha Janus and Mark Womack and ran for two series from 7 September 1998 and 25 October 1999.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166050/ The series represented an early vehicle for Janus' move into mainstream drama roles, following her success in the situation comedy Game On. Despite excellent viewing figures (which never dropped below 6.88m), ITV chose not to re-commission the show after series two. Repeats are intermittently shown on ITV3. The complete series was released on DVD for the first time on 15 August 2016.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Liverpool-1-Complete-Collection- DVD/dp/B01BH0OP0M/ Plot Liverpool 1 focuses on Detective Constable Isobel De Pauli (Samantha Janus), a successful Metropolitan Police detective. Her boyfriend‚Äôs career move to Liverpool in turn sees De Pauli transferred there, and given a job within the Bridewell Vice Squad, under the control of Chief Inspector Graham Hill (Eamon Boland), and overseen by DI Howard Jones (Tom Georgeson). Upon arrival, she is partnered with introverted DC Mark Callaghan (Mark Womack), a no-nonsense officer brought up on the streets of the city he now polices. De Pauli initially takes a disliking to Callaghan, after discovering that he was responsible for throwing a suspect from an apartment window, which is depicted in the opening sequence of the first episode, \\"Fresh Meat\\". However, as her relationship with boyfriend Will Timmer (Tristan Sturrock) collapses, De Pauli grows closer and closer to Callaghan, and becomes friends with his sister, Julie (Gillian Kearney), eventually becoming her lodger. De Pauli shows initial disdain for her new colleagues, but continually grows to like and become good friends with them as time goes on. A number of events occur during the first series which depict the true identity of each character. DC Frank White (Paul Broughton) is depicted as a womaniser and all-round layabout, a decision which comes to haunt him when he places De Pauli's life in danger during a surveillance op in \\"Pipe Dreams\\", where he leaves his post to engage in sexual relations with the owner whose flat is being used as the OP. DC Jo McMullen (Katy Carmichael) is depicted as somewhat of an \\"ice queen\\", and immediately causes tension between herself and De Pauli. In \\"Death By Misadventure\\", the pair finally come to blows - but the subsequent fallout leads to somewhat of an epiphany for the pair. Callaghan is depicted as having somewhat broken relationships with a number of his siblings. The relationship with his brother, drug-addicted Patrick (Scot Williams), is fractured further when he forces Patrick to become an informant, which results in him being shot by a gang of drug dealers, leaving him with only one leg. His relationship with his sister, Julie, isn't much better. His older brother, Ian (Andrew Lancel), a priest for the Catholic church, also holds him in low respect. The first series also centres on the initial personality clash between De Pauli and Callaghan. John Sullivan (Paul Usher), is the main antagonist of the series. The ongoing saga of the squad's pursuit of him over his dodgy business dealings, doubled with the fact that is none other than Callaghan's cousin, makes for a complex interweb of events which sees him turn from criminal mastermind to supergrass. It is also revealed that Callaghan previously had a relationship with Sullivan's wife, Sue, before they got together. Callaghan's difficult relationship with Sullivan is a recurring theme throughout the series. The interconnectedness of the city and its patrons results in several minor characters making more than once appearance in the series, including DS Christian Tomaszewski, who is introduced in \\"Nine Till Five\\" as an out-of-town detective investigating drug dealer O'Brien, who the squad also have in their sights. Tomaszewski then becomes a recurring character throughout the remainder of the series. One of the main relationships featured in the series, between De Pauli and Callaghan, later re-enacted itself in real life, as Janus and Womack began a relationship during the filming of the series. They have since had two children, Benjamin and Lily-Rose, and on 17 May 2009 the pair were married.

He had first joined either the 8th or 9th legion in 65 BC, when Pompey Magnus had first raised these two legions in Spain. He transferred over to the 10th legion as a junior-grade centurion in 61 BC when it was first formed, after being handpicked by Caesar. After joining the 10th legion, he commanded a Century. Crastinus fought throughout Caesar's Gallic campaigns, and was present at the Battle of Alesia, where he witnessed the surrender of the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix to the forces of the Roman Republic. Early in the war, Crastinus commanded his unit as it repelled an attempted crossing of a river by the Helvetii. Crastinus, whom Caesar considered to be amongst his best soldiers, was promoted by Caesar to the rank of Primus Pilus, or \\"First File\\" Centurion. This rank was one of exceptional prestige, since centurions of this rank commanded the first (primus), and most important, century in a Legion. With this rank, Crastinus also would have outranked all other centurions in his legion, as it was the highest possible rank of any enlisted Roman soldier. He died in the battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, playing a vital role as he led a forlorn hope party of volunteers in the opening attack against Pompey's line from Caesar's right wing. As reported by Caesar in the De Bello Civili he incited his comrades saying \\"Follow me, my old comrades, and give your general true service. Only this battle remains; when it's over he will regain his dignity and we our freedom.\\" Then he turned to Caesar and said \\"Today, general, I shall earn your gratitude whether I live or die\\". He almost broke through the enemy line before being killed by an enemy legionary thrusting a gladius in his mouth. Appianus reports that after the battle Caesar himself said to be in Crastinus' debt, tributed him heroic rites and erecting an altar. Ross Cowan in his monograph \\"Roman Battle Tactics 109 BC ‚Äì AD 313\\" advances the hypothesis that Crastinus offered himself as sacrifice to the Underworld Gods to ensure Caesar victory in a Devotio. In this rite, a Roman soldier offered to die in battle and pledged his soul to the Gods of underworld to ensure in exchange the destruction of the enemy. The Italian historian Luciano Canfora in his book \\"Giulio Cesare. Il dittatore democratico\\" likens the figure of Crastinus as that of a political commissar, totally devoted to the Caesarian party to the point of volunteering for a suicide mission.

They play a central role in the study of counting points on elliptic curves in Schoof's algorithm.  Definition  The set of division polynomials is a sequence of polynomials in mathbb{Z}[x,y,A,B] with x, y, A, B free variables that is recursively defined by: ::psi_{0} = 0 ::psi_{1} = 1 ::psi_{2} = 2y ::psi_{3} = 3x^{4} + 6Ax^{2} + 12Bx - A^{2} ::psi_{4} = 4y(x^{6} + 5Ax^{4} + 20Bx^{3} - 5A^{2}x^{2} - 4ABx - 8B^{2} - A^{3}) ::vdots ::psi_{2m+1} = psi_{m+2} psi_{m}^{ 3} - psi_{m-1} psi ^{ 3}_{ m+1} text{ for } m geq 2 ::psi_{ 2m} = left ( frac { psi_{m}}{2y} right ) cdot ( psi_{m+2}psi^{ 2}_{m-1} - psi_{m-2} psi ^{ 2}_{m+1}) text{ for } m geq 3 The polynomial psi_n is called the nth division polynomial.  Properties  *In practice, one sets y^2=x^3+Ax+B, and then psi_{2m+1}inmathbb{Z}[x,A,B] and psi_{2m}in 2ymathbb{Z}[x,A,B]. * The division polynomials form a generic elliptic divisibility sequence over the ring mathbb{Q}[x,y,A,B]/(y^2-x^3-Ax-B). *If an elliptic curve E is given in the Weierstrass form y^2=x^3+Ax+B over some field K, i.e. A, Bin K, one can use these values of A, B and consider the division polynomials in the coordinate ring of E. The roots of psi_{2n+1} are the x-coordinates of the points of E[2n+1]setminus {O}, where E[2n+1] is the (2n+1)^{text{th}} torsion subgroup of E. Similarly, the roots of psi_{2n}/y are the x-coordinates of the points of E[2n]setminus E[2]. *Given a point P=(x_P,y_P) on the elliptic curve E:y^2=x^3+Ax+B over some field K, we can express the coordinates of the nth multiple of P in terms of division polynomials: ::nP= left ( frac{phi_{n}(x)}{psi_{n}^{2}(x)}, frac{omega_{n}(x,y)}{psi^{3}_{n}(x,y)} right) = left( x - frac {psi_{n-1} psi_{n+1}}{psi^{2}_{n}(x)}, frac{psi_{2 n}(x,y)}{2psi^{4}_{n}(x)} right) : where phi_{n} and omega_{n} are defined by: ::phi_{n}=xpsi_{n}^{2} - psi_{n+1}psi_{n-1}, ::omega_{n}=frac{psi_{n+2}psi_{n-1}^{2}-psi_{n-2}psi_{n+1}^{2}}{4y}. Using the relation between psi_{2m} and psi _{2m + 1}, along with the equation of the curve, the functions psi_{n}^{2} , frac{psi_{2n}}{y}, psi_{2n + 1}, phi_{n} are all in K[x]. Let p>3 be prime and let E:y^2=x^3+Ax+B be an elliptic curve over the finite field mathbb{F}_p, i.e., A,B in mathbb{F}_p. The ell-torsion group of E over bar{ mathbb{F}}_p is isomorphic to mathbb{Z}/ell times mathbb{Z}/ell if ell eq p, and to mathbb{Z}/ell or {0} if ell=p. Hence the degree of psi_ell is equal to either frac{1}{2}(l^2-1), frac{1}{2}(l-1), or 0. Ren√© Schoof observed that working modulo the ellth division polynomial allows one to work with all ell-torsion points simultaneously. This is heavily used in Schoof's algorithm for counting points on elliptic curves.  See also  *Schoof's algorithm  References  *A.

It is a brick Gothic Revival structure designed and built in 1871 by Charles Babcock, a former partner of Richard Upjohn. Located at the center of town, near the village hall, it is a local landmark that dominates the village's skyline. Babcock, who was himself an Episcopal priest, designed the building with the Ecclesiological theories of Anglican church architecture in mind. It has been renovated slightly since its construction, and joined to a nearby chapel, but remains largely intact, exemplifying those theories. In 2008 the church and its rectory were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Property The property includes two contributing resources, the church and its rectory. A chapel that was originally freestanding has been connected to the church. Church The church's main facade faces east, towards the triangle of Orchard, Scofield and Walnut streets at the center of town. Opposite is the village's memorial to the local members of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, the \\"Orange Blossoms\\", who served with distinction in the Union Army during the Civil War. The village hall is located diagonally across from it on Walnut Street. It is a single-story brick structure with a steeply-pitched gabled roof. On the southeast side of the nave, near the front entrance, is a bell tower with a tall spire. It and the church's main roof are shingled in slate. The walls are reddish-brown brick laid in common bond. The foundation is of locally quarried brownstone, with a datestone in the southeast corner. Three narrow Gothic lancet windows resting on a brownstone course are evenly spaced across the front, with a roundel high above. The roofline is marked by a corbelled cornice with a metal Latin cross at the gable's apex. The main entrance, at the foot of the bell tower, has double wooden doors, each with a St. Andrew's cross in the lower corner, set in a Gothic arch surrounded with three brick courses. A louvered, recessed Gothic arch marks the bell stage of the tower, which then gives way after brief corbels to the spire, topped with another cross. The four-bay south face, looking out on Orchard Street, has a pair of lancet windows, similar to but smaller than their counterparts on the front. It is broken by the chapel transept, where another lancet window was once bricked over. To the west of the transept is the connection to the chapel. On the north side are an identical grouping of windows and a porch which provides direct access to the nave. A tall brick chimney rises from the wall here. Inside, the sanctuary has the pews arranged with a center aisle and two side ones along the walls. The ceiling is made of beaded wooden boards that expose the hammerbeam roof's trusses. Chamfered wooden posts rise up to it from between the lancet window pairs on either side. A carved wooden altar with Gothic motifs sits in front of the lancet windows in the west wall. In the rear are an office and robing room. The basement is largely unfinished and used for storage. Support functions, such as a kitchen and meeting space, are handled by the rooms of the former chapel. Rectory The rectory, an L-shaped two-and-a-half-story brick house, is located just north of the church along Walnut Street. The three-bay front facade extends east from the larger main block in the rear. It features segmented arched windows with brownstone sills and a wooden porch. The foundation is brownstone. alt=A two-and-a-half-story brick house with cross-gables, decorative window lintels and a white wooden porch Its finishes inside date from the original construction and later renovations. Of note from the latter are the front staircase and architrave between the front and rear parlors. Aesthetics Like Upjohn and other Episcopal architects designing churches for that faith in the mid-19th century, Babcock was strongly influenced by articles and essays in The Ecclesiologist, a journal published by members of England's Oxford Movement, which sought a return to more traditional religious practices in Anglicanism. In architecture that meant the older forms of the English country parish church, many built during the Middle Ages, such as St Michael's Church, Longstanton, which has a similar main block to St. Andrew's. Babcock's initials are found on many sketches of Upjohn's, including one church with tower in Upjohn's pattern book Rural Architecture that strongly resembles St. Andrew's. Christ Church in Ballston Spa, completed by Upjohn's office after he left, also bears a resemblance, although its massing and decoration are less restrained than Babcock typically was. For St. Andrew's, he offset the tower to the side, a variation that had become popular with Ecclesiological architects around the mid-19th century. This created a more Picturesque effect than leaving it in the center. Because of this, and the limitations of the lot, the church's chancel is on the west end rather than liturgical east as most Ecclesiologist-influenced churches do. The rectory, completed slightly after the main church, shows more vernacular influences of its day, and those of later renovations. Its main design is Italianate, but the current porch, rebuilt in the early 20th century, is a Craftsman-style treatment of the original. History The St. Andrew's congregation predates its current church building by a century. It was one of three charters in the region obtained in July 1770 by the Rev. John Sayre, sent as a missionary to the Hudson Valley from London. After the Revolution, it shared its rector with St. George's in nearby Newburgh. Congregants had moved from a primitive log cabin to a more permanent meetinghouse as the church grew, and in 1826 they decided to build a larger one in Walden, at the time an unincorporated preindustrial hamlet known mainly for its mill on the Wallkill River. It was finished and consecrated in September 1827. After the Civil War, the church needed to expand again. It bought the current lot in 1871 from William Scofield, after whom a nearby street is named, for $800 ($ in 2009 dollars). Babcock, at the time transitioning from his position as rector of St. James' Church in Arden to the first professor at what is now Cornell University's College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, delivered plans and construction documents before leaving for Ithaca. Local contractors using local materials were hired, and the church was finished later that year. The debt incurred by the construction was enough that it took until 1880 to pay off, and only then was the church formally consecrated. The rectory was built the following year. In 1884 the congregation decided to accommodate continuing growth by building the chapel on the western end of the lot. At the turn of the century the oil lamps that had originally lit the church's sanctuary were replaced with electric models, and in 1915 the rectory received its remodeled porch and some changes to the interior, such as the rear parlor fireplace. Eventually the congregation decided to combine the chapel and church into one large building. This began in 1924 with a simple hyphen, and culminated 15 years later with the current linkage and its accompanying changes to the chapel's fenestration. The church and rectory have remained intact since that time.

Politics At the 1922 general election, Morris was selected as the Lloyd George National Liberal candidate for Bristol East. Bristol East had been a Liberal seat since its creation in 1885 and had been held by Sir Charles Hobhouse. It was fought and won in 1918 by George Bryant Britton as a Coalition Liberal in opposition to Hobhouse who remained an Independent Asquithian. However Britton did not wish to stand again in 1922 and Morris was chosen to replace him.

Treshchotka (, singular; sometimes referred as Treshchotki, , plural) is a Russian folk music idiophone instrument which is used to imitate hand clapping. Treshchotka (Clapper) Traditional Russian idiophone percussion instrument Treshchotka is a set of small boards on a string that get clapped together as a group Treshchotki is commonly used in Russian folk music. Name The word is derived from the root tresk-, meaning crackling or rattle. In Russian slang, word Treshchotka () sometimes used to describe a person who is excessively chatty and loud. History There are no known documents confirming usage of Treshchotka in ancient Russia; however in 1992, during an archeological dig the city of Novgorod, two wooden boards were found; which, by the hypothesis of Vladimir Ivanovich Povetkin, were parts of the ancient Novgorod's treshchotka of the 12th century. The first published mention of Treshchotka was made by Kliment Vasilievich Kvitka. The great Russian lexicographer Vladimir Dahl describes treshchotka in his \\"Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language\\" as a device made to produce crackling, thundering and racketing sounds. At the present time some villages in Russia are still playing and crafting treshchotkas.  Construction  Treshchotka is made of a set of 15 to 20 thin oak planks/boards which are about 16 to 18 centimeters (approximately 6-8 inches) long; planks are tightly held by a rope that is threaded through the hole on top of each board. To make sure that boards are not pressed against each other a small short piece of wood (2 cm [approximately 1.5 inches]) is inserted between each board. Play To play treshchotka one would hold it by the ends with both hands, generally at the chest or head high and alternate the motion between brusque and smooth to produce crackling and clicking sounds. This technique not only attracts listener by its sounds but also adds visual spectacle effect. Superstitions It is noted that treshchotkas was used during peasant wedding ceremonies where instrument(s) could have been decorated with ribbons, flowers and sometimes jingle bells. The use of the treshchotka in the wedding ceremonies allows to theorize that in the past it were performing not only a role of musical instrument but also served some mystical function, perhaps protecting newlyweds from evil spirits.

On 4 January 1649, the Rump Parliament declared \\"that the people are, under God, the original of all just power; that the Commons of England, being chosen by and representing the people, have the supreme power in this nation\\".Fritze, p. 228 This was used as the basis for the House of Commons to pass acts of parliament which did not have to be passed by the House of Lords or receive royal assent. Two days later the Rump alone passed the act creating the high court of justice that would try Charles as a traitor. Charles was tried and executed later that month. On 17 March, the Rump passed an act abolishing the monarchy and two days later an act abolishing the House of Lords. On 19 May 1649 the Rump passed An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth. It was a simple declaration that Parliament would appoint \\"Officers and Ministers under them for the good of the People... without any King or House of Lords\\". Articles The Instrument of Government split the government of England across three elements. *Executive power was held by the Lord Protector. Although this post was elective, not hereditary, appointment was to be held for life. *Legislation was raised in Parliament. These had to be called triennially, with each sitting for at least five months. *An English Council of State of around twenty members to provide advice in the same manner as former Privy Councils, though with strengthened powers, so that many of the actions taken by the Lord Protector require the consent of a majority of the council; examples include the use of military when parliament is not sitting (IV) and declaring war and peace (V). The council also nominates ministers (XXXIV) and elects the Lord Protector upon the death of the previous one (XXXII). Thus the Lord Protector was far from an absolute ruler, with his powers limited in many areas. All three branches of government had checks upon each other, with the Lord Protector having the authority to veto a bill from Parliament, but a second majority vote after twenty days would pass the bill.(XXIV) The instrument declared \\"That the supreme legislative authority of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the dominions thereunto belonging, shall be and reside in one person, and the people assembled in Parliament: the style of which person shall be the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland\\" Provision for a standing army \\"of 10,000 horse and dragoons, and 20,000 foot, in England, Scotland and Ireland, for the defence and security thereof\\" and \\"a convenient number of ships for guarding of the seas\\"(XXVII). The instrument defined the numbers of MPs to be elected to parliament but at the same time disbarred Royalists from election and temporarily from voting - (XIV) and Catholics from election or voting (XV). Electors needed to have a property holding of ¬£200. Adoption and replacement The Instrument of Government was adopted by the Council of Officers on 15 December 1653 and Oliver Cromwell was installed as Lord Protector on the following day. In January 1655, Cromwell dissolved the first Protectorate Parliament, ushering in a period of military rule by the Major Generals. The Instrument of Government was replaced in May 1657 by England's second, and last, codified constitution, the Humble Petition and Advice.

Individual characteristics form patterns. Patterns relate elements hierarchically across physical scales (from small details to large systems). For an authoritative essay on typology in urban planning and architecture see Rafael Moneo's 1978 essay \\"On Typology\\", published in Oppositions magazine. In this article the history of the notion of type is traced from its origins in the French Enlightenment until the late 20th century. The following is an example of a set of characteristics with typological associations: Single-family detached homes set well back from a street on large lots (about, one-fifth acre to two or more acres) and surrounded by mowed lawns with naturalistic ornamental plantings of trees and shrubs are associated typologically with North American suburban places. Single-family residences that come all the way forward on an individual lot so that the front of the building is coincident with front lot line, or which are set back only a few feet to accommodate a lightwell or front entry stoop, are associated typologically with highly urbanized places in North America. An emphasis on typology is characteristic of New Urbanism. New Urbanists believe it is important to match the physical development characteristics of a place within the appropriate typology for that place, as determined by local preferences taken in context with urban patterns as evidenced throughout history. Modernists, in keeping with their general disinclination to keep within the constraints of tradition and hierarchies of patterns, are less likely to focus on identifying the correct typology of a site.

Canadian Journal of Earth Science 39(11):1591-1603. as well as from the Izumi Group of Japan. These finds date back to the late Santonian stage and the late Campanian to the late Maastrichtian, respectively, of the Late Cretaceous. Kourisodon was originally described as a member of the \\"Leiodontini\\", more recently as a \\"Clidastine\\".  Distribution  Kourisodon puntledgensis is known from a single locality located in the Santonian Pender Formation along the banks of the Puntledge River (after which it was named). K. puntledgensis was a small mosasaur, with an estimated length of about 3.75 meters (around 12.3 feet). It shared its environment with a variety of Elasmosaurids, turtles, and other mosasaurs, although it seems that no polycotylids were present in its Pacific environment. In 2005, a fragmentary skeleton from exposures of the Izumi Group on Shikoku Island, Japan, was assigned to Kourisodon sp. This specimen demonstrated longer maxillary teeth among other differences from K. puntledgensis, which the authors interpreted to mean that this individual belonged to a second species, although this new species has not yet been formally named. Other fragmentary remains from the Izumi Group have been tentatively assigned to K. sp., some of which represent juvenile animals.

Definite remains from this genus have been recovered from the Turonian of Angola, and possibly the Turonian of the United States and Brazil, and the Maastrichtian of Niger. While at one point considered a species of Platecarpus, recent phylogenetic analyses have placed it between the (then) plioplatecarpines Ectenosaurus and Selmasaurus, maintaining a basal position within the plioplatecarpinae. Its wide geographic range make it the one of the only Turonian Mosasaurs with a transatlantic range.  Description  Life reconstruction of Angolasaurus alongside its contemporary, Angolachelys Angolasaurus was a small mosasaur, with a total length of about 4 meters (13 feet). It shared much of a body plan with its relative Platecarpus, but with a slightly longer skull relative to body length. Its skull housed 11 maxillary teeth, 4 premaxillary teeth, and 12 dentary teeth. The phylogenetic relationship of Angolasaurus indicates that individuals of this genus possessed a tail fluke, more forward-lying nostrils, and keeled scales for hydrodynamic efficiency. Due to declining sea temperatures in the area that Angolasaurus inhabited, as well as the later Bientiaba locality, it has been hypothesized that it and the other mosasaurs inhabiting its region may have had an increased coverage of dark patterning on its dorsal surface to aid in thermoregulation.  History of discovery  First named in 1964 by Miguel Telles Antunes on the basis of a partial skull and skeleton, Angolasaurus was reassigned in 1994 to the genus Platecarpus. This placement was subsequently struck down in studies in 2005, which nested it within the plioplatecarpinae. Fieldwork between 2005 and 2009 recovered at least two new Angolasaurus skeletons. One new skull as well as the type skull were CT scanned to reveal intricate details of the interior braincase that allowed for a more concrete placement within the plioplatecarpinae. The most recent major phylogenetic analysis conducted on the mosasauridae placed Angolasaurus as basal to the clade composed of the russellosaurine subfamilies Tylosaurinae and Plioplatecarpinae, and part of neither. In 2007, two individuals from the Eagle Ford Formation of Texas were described as belonging to the genus Angolasaurus, one of which preserved part of the hyoid apparatus. The same abstract assigned two teeth previously assigned to Platecarpus to Angolasaurus. These teeth came from the Sergipe Basin of Brazil, and are virtually indistinguishable from those found in the holotype of Angolasaurus bocagei. These discoveries made Angolasaurus the first known Turonian mosasaur genus with a transatlantic distribution.  Paleoecology  Fossil at the National Museum of Natural History  Angola  Angolasaurus bocagei, recovered only from the Itombe Formation, shared its habitat with the tylosaurine species Tylosaurus (formerly Mosasaurus) iembeensis and the durophagous shallow-water turtle Angolachelys. Indeterminate halisaurine and plesiosaur remains have also been recovered from this region. Terrestrial fauna consisted of the sauropod Angolatitan.  Niger  Known from the Dukamaje Formation on the basis of a few vertebrae of varying ontogenetic stages, Angolasaurus coexisted here with fellow plioplatecarpine genera Platecarpus and Plioplatecarpus, the globidensine genus Igdamanosaurus, the halisaurine genus Halisaurus, the mosasaurine genus Mosasaurus, and the mosasaurid genus Goronyosaurus.  United States  Angolasaurus is known from the Eagle Ford Formation of Texas. Other Turonian aquatic reptiles from the Eagle Ford Formation include the plesiosaurs Polyptychodon, Libonectes, Cimoliasaurus, and Plesiosaurus, and the mosasaur Clidastes.

To the rear of the church is a burial ground containing the remains of both Mohawks and Europeans. It was erected in 1769 by Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, as an Indian mission church for the Mohawk nation. They were the easternmost of the Five Nations of the Iroquois League, who occupied most of New York west of the Hudson River. Background The land was donated by siblings Joseph and Molly Brant, two prominent Mohawk in their village of Canajoharie, located on the south side of the Mohawk River. Construction was done under the direction and at the expense of Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Molly Brant was a longtime companion and common-law wife of Johnson. Her brother Joseph Brant became a prominent Mohawk military leader, allied with the British, during the American Revolutionary War and later led the Mohawk after their migration to Canada.

As of 2019 he is DeWitt Wallace Professor of Mathematics at Macalester College, Director of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences and a former President of the Mathematical Association of America. Life and education Bressoud was born March 27, 1950 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He became interested in mathematics in the seventh grade, where he had a teacher who encouraged him and gave him challenging problems. He attended Albert Wilansky's National Science Foundation summer program at Lehigh University between his junior and senior years in high school, where he also spent most of his time working on problems. He graduated from Swarthmore College in 1971. When he started at Swarthmore he had not yet decided on a major, but after his first year he decided to get out of college as quickly as possibly and had no interest in graduate school, and the quickest way out was to major in mathematics. After graduating Bressoud became a Peace Corps volunteer in Antigua from 1971 to 1973, teaching math and science at Clare Hall School. While in Antigua he realized he missed mathematics, and kept working on it as a hobby. After the Peace Corps he went to graduate school at Temple University, and received his PhD in 1977 under Emil Grosswald. Career After receiving his PhD, Bressoud taught at Pennsylvania State University from 1977 to 1994, reaching the rank of full professor in 1986. During this period he held visiting positions at the Institute for Advanced Study (1979‚Äì1980), the University of Wisconsin (1980‚Äì81 and 1982), the University of Minnesota (1983 and 1998), and the University of Strasbourg (1984‚Äì85). His focus at Penn State was mathematics research, but in the late 1980s he became more interested in teaching and writing textbooks, and he decided to make a move. He said in a 2008 interview, \\"I needed to be in a place that had a strong focus on teaching and a community of people for whom teaching was what they were most interested in.\\" He decided on a move to Macalester College in 1994, where he is now DeWitt Wallace Professor of Mathematics. Since 2005 he has written a monthly online column for MAA titled \\"Launchings\\" that focuses on the CUPM (Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics) Curriculum Guide. Bressoud received several of the Mathematical Association of America's awards: the Distinguished Teaching Award for the Allegheny Mountain section in 1994, the Beckenbach Book Prize in 1999, and he was the George P√≥lya Lecturer from 2002 to 2004. Bressoud was elected president of the Mathematical Association of America in the 2007 elections, and served as President-Elect in 2008 and served as President from 2009 to 2011. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2012-11-10.

The genus contains one species, O. manitoulinensis, from the Ordovician of Manitoulin, Canada.  Morphology  Size comparison of O. manitoulinensis and a human hand  Limbs  Orcanopterus was around 40 cm long. Like all eurypterids, it had six pairs of limbs, the hindmost of which were broad flat paddles. The first pair of limbs in Orcanopterus are unknown, but were presumably small chelicerae for eating with. The second to fourth pairs of limbs were heavily spined and around 7‚Äì8 cm long. The second pair of limbs had four podomeres but is poorly preserved and no spines can be made out. The third pair had four podomeres and three forward-facing spines. The fourth had three podomeres with forward-pointing spines and the fifth pair of limbs had four podomeres, all with spines and with the final podomere a long spine. Its sixth pair of limbs were flat paddles with nine podomeres - the ninth one is unusually large. Three coxae have been identified from the specimen, which have been associated with limbs 4,5 and 6. Coxa 4 has eight small teeth, all thin and about the same size. Coxa 5 is similar, but one of its teeth is much larger than the other seven. Coxa 6 has 22 very small teeth (it is much larger than the other two, hence its association with the largest limb).  Carapace  Orcanopterus\` carapace was formed from the first six segments fused together. The carapace was parabolic in shape with a length:width ratio of around 0.89. At the very front of the carapace there were multiple small folds in the shell following the contours - it is not known what purpose these served. = Eyes = Its eyes were set on the sides of its carapace and near the front, with smaller ocelli set closer to the top.  Body and telson  There are twelve body segments, which can be split into two tagmata, and a telson. The first tagma consists of the first seven body segments. All are rounded and much wider than they are long, narrowing gradually until the second tagma is reached. This consists of the last five segments (barring the telson) which are only slightly wider than they are long and have straight sides, with a small doublure around the outer margin. All the body segments are smooth on top, with no ridge or spines, and have broad angular scales on the underside. The telson is long and thin, coming to a point at the end - overall it is leaf-shaped. On the upper side of the telson there was a keel, which probably kept Orcanopterus steady in the water. = Genitalia = Orcanopterus' genital operculum was located on the underside of the second segment after the carapace. It was made up of two segments and the furca, but appears to be comparatively without ornament. The first pair of sternites after the genital operculum are unfused.

CTV News, 14 December 2018. She was originally built as an icebreaking anchor handling tug Vidar Viking for Trans Viking Icebreaking & Offshore AS in 2001. The vessel was acquired by the Canadian Coast Guard in August 2018 and was commissioned in May of the next year after refit. CCGS Captain Molly Kool has two sister vessels, and , both of which are converted offshore vessels.  Design  CCGS Captain Molly Kool is long overall and between perpendiculars. Her hull has a beam of and moulded depth of . At design draught, she draws of water, but can be loaded to a maximum draught of which corresponds to a displacement of 6,872tons. Originally built to DNV ice class \\"ICE-10 Icebreaker\\", her hull structures and propulsion system will be upgraded to Polar Class 4 level and the vessel will be rated as Arctic Class 2 in Canadian service. Originally she was served by a crew of 23, but this has been reduced to 19 (9 officers and 10 crew) when the vessel was acquired by the Canadian Coast Guard. CCGS Captain Molly Kool has four medium-speed diesel engines geared to two controllable pitch propellers in nozzles. She has two eight-cylinder MaK 8M32 and two six-cylinder MaK 6M32 diesel engines rated at and each. With a total propulsion power of , she can achieve a maximum speed of in open water and break ice at a continuous speed of . In addition, she has two bow thrusters (one fixed, one retractable and azimuthing) and one transverse stern thruster for maneuvering and dynamic positioning.  Career = Vidar Viking (2001‚Äì2018)  In 2004, Vidar Viking acted as the drillship for the Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) in the high Arctic. The vessel remained on location in the multi-year polar ice pack for nine days while being supported by the Swedish icebreaker Oden and the Russian nuclear- powered icebreaker Sovetskiy Soyuz. During the expedition, the ship stopped at the North Pole. In late January 2010, the Swedish Maritime Administration called for Vidar Viking and Tor Viking to serve as icebreakers in the Baltic Sea. The vessels were chartered on a contingency basis ‚Äî where Trans Viking's parent company, Transatlantic, receives a basic flat fee for the vessels to be available within ten days, without regard to whether they were used. Their previous usage was in 2007. The contract expired in 2015. In February 2010 Balder Viking, Vidar Viking and were chartered by Edinburgh-based oil company Cairn Energy for four months, starting in June 2010, for drilling operations in Baffin Bay. In 2012, the Swedish Maritime Administration agreed to end the charter for Vidar Viking prematurely for the 2011‚Äì2012 Baltic Sea icebreaking season and all subsequent seasons. The vessel then provided icebreaking services for the Estonian Maritime Administration for one winter season before heading to Sakhalin where she provided icebreaking, supply and anchor handling services starting from summer 2012 for Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Limited. After six months, she was reflagged to Russia and her crew changed to Russians.Russia: Sakhalin Energy Hires Vidar Viking AHTS. Offshore Energy Today, 26 December 2011. Viking Supply Ships and Sakhalin Energy start cooperation. Viking Supply Ships, 30 April 2012. Vidar Viking was reflagged to Danish International Register of Shipping in 2016 and to Norway in 2017.  CCGS Captain Molly Kool (2018‚Äìpresent)  In 2016, Davie Shipbuilding began offering Vidar Viking and her sister ships as a replacement to the ageing Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers under the moniker Project Resolute. In addition to the three Swedish icebreaking offshore vessels, the offer also included a fourth slightly bigger and more powerful vessel: the US-flagged . On 10 August 2018, Viking Supply Ships announced the sale of its three vessels to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada for $274 million. Once retrofitted at Davie Shipbuilding, the vessels are expected to remain in service in the Canadian Coast Guard for 15 to 25 years. The vessel was the first to be ready to undertake Coast Guard missions. She had been repainted in Coast Guard livery on 13 November 2018. Some of the modifications the Coast Guard plans for the vessel, and her sister ships, were deferred, so that she could be employed ice-breaking in the St Lawrence estuary during the winter of 2019. In particular, one highly visible deferred item will be the addition of a landing pad and hangar for a light utility helicopter. CCGS Captain Molly Kool was named after Captain Myrtle (Molly) Kool (1916‚Äì2009), born in Alma, New Brunswick, who was the first female licensed ship captain in North America. She was also the first female deep sea Captain in North America. At the time, she was only the second woman in the world to hold that achievement. Having grown up spending her summers sailing with her father in waters in and around the Bay of Fundy, Molly learned about life at sea and became an accomplished sailor. After high school, Molly convinced the Merchant Marine School in Saint John, New Brunswick to admit her as a student. She would obtain her Mate's certificate in 1937. In 1939, she obtained her coastal Master's Certificate and graduated from the Merchant Marine Institute in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. On 22 March 2019, Captain Molly Kool and were dispatched to aid the tanker Jana Desgagnes which had damaged a rudder in heavy ice southwest of Port-aux- Basques, Newfoundland. Captain Molly Kool towed the vessel further out to sea to await the arrival of a tugboat, which would take the tanker to Sydney, Nova Scotia for repairs. During the operation, Captain Molly Kool used her towing notch, a feature not present in other CCG icebreakers currently in service, to escort the stricken tanker through the ice.

Appointment to United States Senate On February 3, 2009, President Barack Obama announced that he would appoint Gregg, then a Republican Senator representing New Hampshire, as the Secretary of Commerce. Later in the day, Lynch announced that he would appoint Newman to the Senate to fill Gregg's seat. Newman announced that she would not run for reelection in 2010, nor would she endorse any candidate in that race. In face of Senate Republican Leaders asking Gregg to reconsider, Gregg reached a deal with Governor John Lynch that he would appoint a placeholder in order to avoid changing the partisan makeup of the United States Senate. However, on February 12, 2009, citing \\"irresolvable conflicts\\" with the Obama administration on issues surrounding the United States census and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Gregg announced he was withdrawing his nomination for the position of Commerce Secretary and remaining in the Senate. Political activities Newman considered running for the Senate in 1990 for the seat held by the retiring Gordon J. Humphrey. Newman was one of the first Republicans to publicly endorse John Lynch, a Democrat, in his successful 2004 challenge of then- Republican Governor Craig Benson. In the campaign, she co-chaired Republicans for Lynch. Newman joined Standing Up for New Hampshire Families, a bipartisan organization opposing the effort of the New Hampshire Legislature to repeal legislation allowing same-sex marriage in New Hampshire.

Fossils of the genus have been recovered in relative abundance from Canada, Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and large parts of the United States, including Oklahoma, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, Utah, Nevada. The major eumalacostracan lineages had already diverged from each other during the Devonian, but their early evolutionary history remains relatively unknown due to a poor fossil record, making fossils of Angustidontus and other early eumalacostracans important for scientific study. Historically of uncertain classification, studies on the paleobiology of Angustidontus have allowed researchers to place it between the eumalacostracan orders Amphionidacea and Decapoda.  Description  Angustidontus was a predatory angustidontid crustacean, measuring about 6 centimeters in length (9 centimeters if the large maxillipeds are counted). It had one pair of grasping maxillipeds and seven pairs of pereiopods. The first to fifth pair of pereiopods were subchelate and short, ending in a hooked and enlarged dactylus. The sixth and seventh pairs were thinner and longer, ending in simpler and smaller dactyli. The fifth and sixth pleonal somites expanded laterally, with some partial overlap over the telson. Angustidontus had large grasping appendages, modified from the first or second thoracopods, which represent some of the earliest maxillipeds within the Eucarida. These maxillipeds were likely used through being folded downwards to strike at prey, then hold the prey and prevent it from wriggling itself free. Schramidontus, the only known close relative of Angustidontus, also possessed a second smaller pair of maxillipeds that it could use to bring prey to the maxillae, maxillulae and its large mandibles, but these are absent in Angustidontus. Instead, Angustidontus used the next four pairs of thoracopods (which were short and possessed strong claws and serrated gnathobases) to tear apart prey and transport it to the mouth.  History of research  The genus Angustidontus was named by Chalmer L. Cooper in 1936, together with the family \\"Angustidontidae\\". Cooper described the fossils, consisting of the serrated appendages, as fossil jaws of actinopterygian fish. Since then, the appendages of Angustidontus have been the subject of much debate on its classification. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the fossils instead represented eurypterid chelicerae, possibly of something closely related to Pterygotus.Raasch, G. O. 1956. Late Devonian and/or Mississippian faunal succession in Stettler area, Alberta. Journal of the Alberta Society of Petroleum Geologists 4, 112‚Äì18. Copeland & Bolton (1960) considered the fossils to instead represent gill rakers of fish or be \\"claws similar to those on the second maxilliped of the stomatopod Squilla\\", furthermore the appendage was noticed to have had some kind of \\"ball and socket\\" joint type of articulation.Copeland, M. J. & Bolton, T. E. 1960. The Eurypterida of Canada. Geological Survey of Canada, Bulletin 60, 13‚Äì47. Though it was noted several times by prominent researchers that Angustidontus did likely not represent a eurypterid, it was subsequently treated as a eurypterid (albeit dubiously so) for decades by many authors. This was not universal however, with Jean Berdan concluding in 1964, after studying multiple Angustidontus appendages, that the \\"rami of Angustidontus are almost certainly part of an arthropod rather than a vertebrate but are not necessarily part of a eurypterid\\". Angustidontus often occurs together with Concavicaris, another Devonian crustacean. Concavicaris fossils tend to lack the appendages, whilst Angustidontus fossils often lack the cephalothoracic shield because of its weak sclerotisation. This caused some confusion, and some researchers have suggested that the two would represent different parts of the same animal. Expeditions to fossil localities in Nevada where Concavicaris and Angustidontus were reported to have occurred together by Cooper in 1936 yielded more information on the appendages of Concavicaris and allowed it to be determined that the appendages of Angustidontus did not represent appendages of Concavicaris. With hundreds of specimens being collected, proper research could be conducted on Angustidontus for the first time with the discovery of the first complete specimens. The new specimens allowed researchers to determine that Angustidontus was a peracarid malacostracan crustacean, and that Concavicaris simply represented a separate animal that was part of a larger Late Devonian fauna including a large amount of different invertebrates, such as worms, cephalopods, bivalves, brachipods and sponges. The appendages which had caused confusion in the past were revealed to be the first thoracopods, but greatly elongated and adapted to be used in feeding.  Classification  A generalized bauplan of a malacostracan crustacean. The cephalon and thorax was fused in Angustidontus as a single cephalothoracic shield and the first thoracopod had developed into a maxilliped. Angustidontus is classified as part of the extinct family Angustidontidae together with the freshwater genus Schramidontus from Belgium. This family is the only family classified as part of the eucarid order Angustidontida. Angustidontids are diagnosed as eucarids that possess carapaces and stalked eyes with \\"scale-like exopods\\" on the second antennae, an elongated pleion and a tail fan. These features make the group distinct from most eumalacostracan crustaceans and they are classified as part of the Eucarida due to their carapace being fused to thoracic segments 1-7. Some additional species of Angustidontus have been named other than the type species (A. seriatus), such as \\"A. weihmannae\\", but they were all considered synonymous with A. seriatus by Rolfe & Dzik (2006), with only the type species remaining as valid. Based on the morphology of different fossil mandibles, fossil material from the Early Famennian of Poland may represent two possible additional species. The cladogram below is based on the relationships of the Eucarida assumed by Gueriau, Charbonnier and Cl√©ment (2014), based on the gradual modification of the first thoracopods into the maxillipeds seen in the Decapoda.  Paleoecology = Environment  The life environment of Angustidontus was low in diversity, but might have been very high in biological productivity. Fossil animals found in association with Angustidontus are exclusively open sea pelagic creatures, such as conodonts, cephalopods, ostracods, concavicarids and fish. The bottom regions were likely slightly benthose with a soft and muddy environment. This environment was likely anaerobic and poisonous, with abundant hydrogen sulfide, which would have prevented decomposition and allowed for fossils to be preserved. Concavicarids, pelagic crustaceans of uncertain classification found in association with Angustidontus, also had chelicerae-like appendages and were covered in protective spines. They were predators, with known stomach contents including cephalopod remains as well as shark and teleost fish vertebrae. The appendages of concavicarids like Concavicaris differed in functionality from those of Angustiodontus and were thus likely used to catch other kinds of prey than what was eaten by Angustidontus. Concavicarids may not only have occupied a different niche, but an entirely different level in the water column.  Prey  There are no taxonomically identifiable gut contents in any Angustidontus specimen. There are some known small fossil pieces found in association to Angustidontus specimens that may represent cephalopod jaws or conches of thin-shelled molluscs. The specimen NMNH 530451 preserves a spiral imprint that might represent the larval conch of a goniatite. Angustidontus might thus have fed on cephalopods. Another likely prey item based on its presence in Late Devonian pelagic environments are conodonts.

Two new singers came, Ivana Pavloviƒá and Goca Tr≈æan, and their musical genre changed. They also started working with manager Gane Pecikoza who remained their manager ever since. The group became known by the shortened word of Tapir remains just Tap. A, 011 was added because it is the country code for Belgrade, and they were all from Belgrade. History The first album released in early 1995. under the name Novi svet (New world) and after a few months becomes best-selling edition of popular music. With this album stand out songs Bunda which was also the biggest hit, Opasna po zivot, Bez tebe, Pekara, Hit and Sume. This was followed by numerous concerts, awards, and their songs became a staple on all radio stations. It comes and Tapovci 1996 and released their second album which was named Gace and who has released an abnormal number of hits. Surpassed the circulation of the previous one and becomes a megahit song Bez tebe, or Gace. Almost everything on the album became the real hits, and they are Vuk, TV, Vrapci, Zene, Ovca, Komsinica Mica, Sanjaj me and Tvoja mala lujka. That year, as in the previous Tap 011 wins all the possible music awards and once again confirms that in the very top of Serbian music scene.

Fossils have been registered from the Early Carboniferous period. The genus contains only one species, U. anastasiae, recovered from deposits of Tournaisian to Vis√©an stages in Kazakhstan. Known from one single specimen (now presumed to be lost) which was described in a publication of Russian language with poor illustrations, Unionopterus' affinities are extremely poorly known. Unionopterus was described in 1948 after the discovery of its only known specimen in the Karaganda Formation of Kazakhstan (at that time part of the Soviet Union). This was one of the first discoveries of eurypterids in the Soviet Union and Carboniferous eurypterids in general. It was probably a swimming organism as well as other eurypterids, although not as good as its relatives. There are numerous factors that have made Unionopterus a problematic genus for eurypterid researchers. It has been placed in the family Adelophthalmidae and it has even been speculated that a species of Adelophthalmus, A. dumonti, actually belongs to Unionopterus, but this cannot be confirmed. Many authors have chosen to completely ignore the genus during phylogenetic studies, making Unionopterus an enigmatic eurypterid. Description Diagram showchasting the body parts of a eurypterid, represented by Eurypterus, a form distantly related to Unionopterus. Unionopterus was a very small eurypterid, with the length of the body being estimated at 2.38 cm (0.9 in), although this measure excludes unknown parts of the body (like the 12th body segment or the tail). Unionopterus was far smaller than the largest adelophthalmids, such as Adelophthalmus khakassicus of 32 cm (12.6 in) in length. The morphology of Unionopterus is relatively well known since its only known specimen is almost completely preserved. The prosoma (\\"head\\") was trapezoid and somewhat narrow anteriorly, being close to that of Eurypterus. It was surrounded by a wide marginal border. The lateral eyes were small (about 1.5 millimetres or 0.06 inches long), reniform (bean-shaped) and close to the prosoma, resembling Nanahughmilleria. The ocelli (simple eye-like sensory organs) occupied a subcentral (almost central) position, immediately behind the eyes. Also known is the metastoma (a large plate that is part of the abdomen), which extended to the second segment, probably shifted downwards. As in the rest of eurypterids, the opisthosoma was divided into twelve segments. The tergites (dorsal half of the segment) of the mesosoma (comprising segments 1 to 6) were rigid and covered with chitin. The first opisthosomal segment was twice as short as the rest, and the fourth was the widest. From this segment, the opisthosoma would begin to narrow gradually. The seventh segment carried two lateral extensions, known as epimera, and was separated from the other five by a weakly expressed groove. The pretelson (12th segment anterior to the telson) and telson (\\"tail\\") are not known, but due to the opisthosoma structure, the telson was probably similar to the one of Hughmilleria (styliform and lanceolate). The metasoma (compromising segments 7 to 12) had an ornamentation that consisted of small and frequent scales grouped in rows that overlaped each other, a system of ornamentation common among the genera of Adelophthalmidae. Only four out of the six pairs of appendages are known. In the second pair, the eighth podomere (leg segment) had the appearance of a thin spine (1.01 mm or 0.03 in long), while the seventh, sixth and fifth only differed slightly in thickness and length. According to weak traces, they all possessed spines in their distal ends, which were probably preserved in a different position than during their lifetime's. The rest of the podomeres were hidden under the prosoma, and therefore they are not known. The third pair was more or less similar to the second one, but thicker and longer than the latter, with different proportions and spikes in the podomeres. Few fragments are known from the fourth pair, while the fifth pair is not known at all. In the sixth pair of appendages, also known as swimming legs, the seventh podomere was long and very expanded towards the end, the eighth was elliptical and large, but not as much as the previous one. In a shallow groove located on the inner side of the eighth podomere was the ninth one in the form of a small spine. These podomeres form the paddle of the swimming leg. Parts of the coxae (the point of union with the prosoma and the appendages) are known, but all are poorly preserved and in a unnatural position, as well as potential remains of chelicerae (first pair of appendages). History of research Unionopterus is only known by an almost complete fossil from the Karaganda Formation, Karaganda, Kazakhstan (then part of the Soviet Union). The fossil was deposited in a coal seam, and was collected from a borehole. Unionopterus represented the only eurypterid (and merostomate, an outdated group that encompassed eurypterids and xiphosurans) of the entire Soviet Union after Adelophthalmus carbonarius. This specimen was collected by the Russian geologist Leonty Leontiyevich Halfin and sent to the Ukrainian paleontologist Boris Isidorovich Chernyshev, who described it in 1948 and also described A. carbonarius in 1933. Due to its temporal rank (Lower Carboniferous, one of the first finds from this period), Chernyshev considered the genus as worthwhile for the knowledge of Eurypterida and its evolution, placing it in the family Pterygotidae. He gave it the specific epithet anastasiae to honour his wife, who helped him during the study of Unionopterus. Unionopterus has been considered as an enigmatic genus whose classification is highly uncertain. Because its only known specimen is probably lost and the original description by Chernyshev was not well-illustrated and in Russian, its re-study is impossible. Unionopterus has been considered as a genus close to Adelophthalmus, as incertae sedis in the whole Eurypterida order or directly ignored by eurypterid researchers. Victor P. Tollerton Jr. considered Unionopterus as part of his new family Adelophthalmidae, and placed the genus in it in 1989 based in the possession of spines in its appendages and their similar appearance with those of Adelophthalmus, with which some authors agree. If this was the case, Unionopterus would represent not only the only post-Devonian form of the family Adelophthalmidae, but of the whole suborder Eurypterina (swimming eurypterids) along with Adelophthalmus itself. Further, in 2005 the paleontologists Odd Erik Tetlie and Jason A. Dunlop suggested that the Belgian species Adelophthalmus dumonti could actually represent a species of Unionopterus due to similarities in the trapezoidal shape of the prosoma and the width of the marginal rim. However, this was contested by Tetlie and Peter Van Roy a year later, following the re-analysis of a specimen of A. dumonti which showed that its carapace in fact had a parabolic (approximately U-shaped) shape and a narrow marginal rim, unlike that shown in its original description in 1917. Classification Sixth to eight body segments of Unionopterus Restoration of the possibly related Adelophthalmus Chernyshev classified Unionopterus as a member of the family Pterygotidae, mainly due to its great similarities to Hughmilleria (genus which he thought should have a separate clade), such as the prosoma and opisthosoma shape, position of the eyes, aerodynamic body, epimera, gradual narrowing of the body and shape of the swimming leg, among others. Victor P. Tollerton Jr. would classify it in 1989 in the family Adelophthalmidae, but some later authors consider this classification uncertain. The phylogenetic classification of Unionopterus is not clear due to the poor illustrations given by Chernyshev and the probable loss of the only known specimen of Unionopterus. There are several factors that help the inclusion of the genus in Adelophthalmidae, such as the possession of spines in the appendage or epimeras in the metasoma, but the trapezoidal shape of the prosoma is different from all adelophthalmids. In addition, the affinities within Adelophthalmidae of Unionopterus are also uncertain, as it seems to share characteristics with Adelophthalmus but also with the more basal (\\"primitive\\") Nanahughmilleria and Pittsfordipterus. It has also been suggested that the fossil described by Chernyshev in fact represents another specimen of Adelophthalmus whose characteristics have been misinterpreted, but since the location of the fossil is still unknown, it is possible that this will never be resolved. The following cladogram is based on a larger phylogenetic analysis carried out by Tetlie (2004) in an unpublished thesis encompassing every more or less well known eurypterid genus. It has been simplified to only show Adelophthalmoidea and the closely related Pterygotoidea, with Carcinosomatoidea and the waeringopteroids as outgroup taxa (used as reference groups). Paleoecology Like other forms with a similar body structure, it is likely that Unionopterus was a benthic (living at the lowest level of the waterbody) organism. Its body and lifestyle were capable of and adapted to not only swimming, but also crawling. However, Unionopterus would not have been so active as other relatives.

He has been described as 'one of the most influential economic geographers in the discipline over the last 30 years'.

He was amongst the first to point out the significance of TNCs, providing detailed analysis of their role in the world economy ‚Äì explaining how they are a barometer for global economic change. Dicken provided a greater understanding of chains and network structures - in particular by understanding the role, locational behaviour and organisation of Japanese capital and firms in Western economies. His work on the economic restructuring of Japanese firms regarding the Just- In-Time production process is widely cited. Through his work, he was able to explain global economic change in relation to global-local dialect.

The kolpos (Greek: Œ∫œåŒªœÄŒøŒπœÇ Œ∫œåŒªœÄŒøŒΩ Œ∫œåŒªœÄ·ø≥, a gulf, bay or creek) is the blousing of a peplos, chiton or tunic in Ancient Greek clothing, whereby excess length of the material hangs folded over a zone (a narrow girdle). The fabric of the garment was typically cut longer than the shoulder-to-floor measurement of the women or man wearing it. The excess length was dealt with at the waist (creating the kolpos) and optionally the top edge (creating the apoptygma). To create the kolpos, a zone was tied around the body below the breast (high-girdled) or at the waist (low-girdled) and excess fabric was pulled up over it. The fabric fell over the girdle so as to hide it, and was often pulled longer in back than in front. This fold was the kolpos.

It is preserved at the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry in Stellarton, Nova Scotia and is the oldest locomotive in Canada. Construction The locomotive was built in 1838 by Timothy Hackworth at his Soho Works in Durham, England. Samson represents an early design of steam locomotive with a return-flue boiler. The fireman and engineer worked separately on open platforms at either end of the locomotive. It was commissioned for the General Mining Association along with two other locomotives, Hercules and John Buddle, for the Albion Mines Railway to serve mines in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. Arrival The locomotives arrived unassembled aboard the brig Ythan in May 1839.Herb Macdonald, \\"First Rails in Atlantic Canada: The Evolution of a Legend\\", Canadian Rail, No. 474, January‚ÄìFebruary 2000, p. 13. A number of popular works give 1838 as the arrival date but Macdonald notes that this is contradicted by newspaper accounts and General Mining Association correspondence. Two engineers arrived with the locomotives (the Samson, the John Buddle and the Hercules), including George Davidson, who helped build the locomotives in England and would settle in Nova Scotia to work with Samson for the rest of his career. Also accompanying the locomotives on the journey was John Brown Stubbs (Stobbs), Hackworth's master mechanic. He too helped build the locomotives and when the job was complete, he returned to Hackworth's employ in England. The new railway officially opened with a large celebration on 19 September 1839, although the tracks were not actually completed to the coal pier until May 1840. Career Samson served from 1839 to 1867 carrying coal on the six-mile line from the mines around Stellarton and New Glasgow to the East River loading pier. It proved a strong and reliable locomotive, considered \\"slow but of great power\\" by railway workers of the day.\\"The Saga Of The Samson: Canada's Oldest Locomotive\\" Pictou County Historical Society (1968) digitized by Pictou-Antigonish Regional Library One former engineer recalled how it moved a heavy string of coal cars from a crooked siding on a wet day when a more modern locomotive failed to move them. In addition to its regular duties moving coal cars, Samson also saw service carrying passengers in an early design of a passenger coach. The locomotive was semi-retired in 1867 but continued to operate when necessary until 1885.Herb MacDonald, \\"The Albion Mines Railway of 1839-40: Some British Roots of Canada's First Industrial Railway\\", Early Railways: A selection of Papers from the First International Early Railways Conference,The Newcomen Society, London (2001), p. 274 It was sent to Chicago to the National Exhibition of Railway Appliances in 1883. Preservation Samson preserved at the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry Samson languished on a scrapline until 1893 when it was displayed at the Chicago World‚Äôs Fair as an antique, and acquired along with one of its passenger coaches by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad where it was preserved. In 1927 Samson was returned to Nova Scotia. The passenger coach stayed behind and may be seen today at the B&O; Railroad Museum. Samson was displayed beside the Halifax train station until 1950 when the locomotive was moved to New Glasgow. Today it is displayed in the Age of Steam Gallery at the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry in Stellarton, part of the Nova Scotia Museum system where it is restored to its appearance at the end of its working life. A careful survey of the structure of the locomotive before restoration found it remarkably well preserved, retaining 90% of its end of service parts. Examination of the parts show various repairs and evolutionary modifications which were added to the original Hackworth assembly by the shops of the Albion Mines Railway during the locomotive's long working career. A small number of parts such as the steel tires were added by the B & O railroad museum after the locomotive retired.Michael R. Bailey and John P.

Since its founding in 1986, the organization has been involved in designing energy efficiency and renewable energy programs in North America and worldwide. VEIC also operates three large-scale energy efficiency programs in the United States, including Efficiency Vermont, the nation‚Äôs first statewide energy efficiency utility. History VEIC was founded in 1986 by Beth Sachs and Blair Hamilton with a goal to reduce energy costs for consumers by promoting energy efficiency and encouraging the conservation of natural resources. In particular, they focused their early efforts on helping reduce the burden of energy costs for low income consumers. By 1997, VEIC had implemented energy efficiency measures in nearly 100 low-income multifamily buildings throughout the state of Vermont; it also led a successful effort to establish an ordinance requiring landlords in the city of Burlington to meet a minimum efficiency standard before their buildings could be sold to new owners. Through a partnership with the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, VEIC also helped to establish financing programs and a home energy rating system to help low-income and first-time homebuyers avoid being burdened with high energy costs. In 2000, VEIC won a competitive contract to operate Efficiency Vermont, the first statewide energy efficiency utility in the nation. Efficiency Vermont has been credited as an effective program: * By the end of 2005, annual energy usage in Vermont had been reduced by 98,000 megawatt-hours * In 2007 Vermont became the first state in the nation to turn electrical load growth negative * Between 2009-2011, estimated energy savings produced by Efficiency Vermont were 304,000 megawatt-hours * In 2011, efficiency accounted for a 1.91 percent reduction in Vermont‚Äôs electricity supply requirements and 790,000 tons of avoided CO2 emissions In 2007, VEIC established a 20-year goal to offset twice the amount of greenhouse gas emissions projected to be emitted in Vermont in the year 2027. Over the course of 2010-2011, VEIC won competitive contracts to start up and begin operation of additional large- scale energy efficiency programs based in Ohio and Washington, D.C. Efficiency Smart, based in Columbus, Ohio, is a program of energy efficiency services offered to a network of public power companies that are members of American Municipal Power, Incorporated (AMP). VEIC operates Efficiency Smart under contract to AMP and has designed the program to save 70,000 megawatt-hours of electricity over the course of its first three years in operation. The District of Columbia Sustainable Energy Utility (DC SEU) is operated under contract to the District Department of the Environment in Washington, D.C. The DC SEU contract is held by the Sustainable Energy Partnership, with VEIC serving as the partnership lead. In February 2012, VEIC, The Clark Group, and Vermont Law School were awarded a $34 million blanket purchase agreement to help the Environmental Protection Agency improve energy efficiency for commercial, institutional, and industrial customers throughout the U.S. At a 2012 U.S. Senate forum on jobs, Scott Johnstone, the Executive Director of VEIC, reported that the organization continues to grow, despite the economic recession that began in 2008. According to his statement, from 2005-2012 VEIC increased its number of employees by 130%, and its revenues grew by 286%. VEIC is also an active resource on transportation efficiency. It is facilitating the state of Vermont‚Äôs participation in the Rocky Mountain Institute‚Äôs ‚ÄúProject Get Ready‚Äù program, which is working to prepare for the electrification of the transportation system. It is also conducting research on least-cost transportation strategies, and best practices for applying energy efficiency principles to travel behavior and consumer purchase decisions in the transportation sector.

The term may have been coined by Goldman Environmental Prize winning hydrologist Michal Kravcik. Hot stains can be found on every continent, except for Antarctica. The biggest reason for a hot stain to develop is population pressure. As the population grows, water demand increases. Although the earth is covered in 97% water, only 1% of that water is available for human consumption. Hot stains can cause great harm to a regions agricultural ability and can lead to food scarcity, famine, and even the abandonment of the region. Maude Barlow an environmental activist, head of the Council of Canadians, and founder of the Blue Planet Project has used the term 'hot stain' in regard to water resources. In 2005, Maude Barlow received Sweden's Right Livelihood Award. Water resources 'Hot stains' areas are one term given where water reserves are disappearing. These areas include the Middle East, Northern China, Mexico, California and almost two dozen countries in Africa.

Life Hollis was born at Wells, Somerset, in 1902, one of the four sons of George Arthur Hollis (1868‚Äì1944), vice-principal of the Wells Theological College and later Bishop of Taunton. He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was president of the Oxford Union Society and member of the Hypocrites' Club. He travelled as a member of the Union's debating team to the United States, New Zealand and Australia.Hollis, (Maurice) Christopher page at unipv.itObituary - Mr Christopher Hollis, Writer and former MP in The Times, Issue 59998, Monday, 9 May 1977, p. 16, col. E At Oxford he met his lifelong friend Douglas Woodruff. He was a friend of Ronald Knox and Evelyn Waugh and in 1924 converted to Roman Catholicism, as Knox had already done and as Waugh did later. For ten years from 1925 he taught history at Stonyhurst College, then from 1935 to 1939 was a visiting professor of the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, where he carried out economic research. At the beginning of the Second World War, Hollis returned home and served throughout the war as a Royal Air Force intelligence officer. Immediately after the war, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Devizes in Wiltshire and held the seat until he retired undefeated in 1955. While in the House of Commons, he showed an independent spirit, for example by supporting the abolition of capital punishment while that was not his party's general view, and was popular on all sides. When he left the Commons (to be succeeded by another Conservative, Percivall Pott) he became a parliamentary commentator for Punch and retired to Mells, near Frome in Somerset, where he spent his time in writing books and journalism and in supporting Somerset County Cricket Club and other local interests. He was also a member of the publishing firm Hollis and Carter, a subsidiary of Burns and Oates. In 1957 he briefly revisited Australia, in association with the Congress for Cultural Freedom. Hollis wrote books and articles on a variety of historical and political subjects. His last book, Oxford in the Twenties (1976) is about his wide circle of friends, including Evelyn Waugh, Maurice Bowra, Harold Acton, Leslie Hore-Belisha, and the cricketer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow. Family In 1929, Hollis married Madeleine King, daughter of the Rev. Richard King, Rector of Cholderton, and herself also a Roman Catholic convert, and they had one daughter and three sons, including Crispian Hollis, Bishop of Portsmouth.T. F.

It lies to the south of the Preseli Hills close to the Western Cleddau river, and close to the main A40 road from Fishguard to Haverfordwest. The area has an interesting local geology and evidence of mineral extraction at least as far back as Roman times. The present village is medieval in origin. Geology The village name is derived from the Welsh-language words tref (\\"town\\") and carn (\\"cairn, mound, rock\\"). The reference in this case is to the Treffgarne Rocks, a series of ancient Ordovician rhyolite volcanic plugs, now exposed, that form the Roche Rhyolite Group. A number of interesting minerals have been recorded including Brookite crystals (Titanium dioxide) and possibly tin.Geological Magazine, Published by Cambridge University Press, 1866, Item notes: v.3, page 378 Small regular cavities can be found in the rocks where crystals of at least 1 cm width once resided. Gold has also been found at the rocks from drillcores and placer gold in the local Western Cleddau below the village. There is also an old legend of old gold workings near Treffgarne (possibly towards the farm Mount Pleasant) from the Roman period. Roman activity is certainly attested in the region with at least two Romano-British settlements nearby at Ambleston (Castle Flemming) and Wolfscastle and a possible extension of the Roman road from Carmarthen into Pembrokeshire. History The site of the village itself goes back to at least the medieval period. Evidence for this is in the form of a nearby medieval strip lynchet field system to the north of the village and a suggestion that the current parish church, dedicated to St Michael, sits on the site of a medieval monastery. There was evidence of earlier encampments, but these had been levelled by the 19th century. Now bypassed by the modern A40 trunk road from Fishguard to Haverfordwest, the village originally sat on the turnpike that ran between these two ports. Until the 1970s the village was quite small with no more than 120 inhabitants but has since grown with the development of a modern estate to the west of the church. Close to the village to the west is Treffgarne Hall, erected in 1842 by Dr. Evans. It was converted into a restaurant in 1979 by executive chef Derek Stenson and his partner John Neville, former sous chef at the Dorchester Hotel, but this endeavour did not last. Close to the village to the north east is the disused Treffgarne Quarry which provided roadstone.

Origin of Ramsnehi Portrait of the Founder of RamSnehi Sampradaya. Shri 1008 (Salutation) Swami Ji Shri Ram Charan Ji Maharaj. Ramsnehi Sampradaya is a spiritual and religious tradition originating in 1817 Vikram Samwat in Bhilwara city of Rajasthan by the disciple of Swami Shri Ram Charan Maharaj who provided the spiritual and philosophical basis for the sect. In present time, Ramsnehi Sampradaya has four major monasteries. All are in Rajasthan, India. They are in the following cities: *Shahpura, Rajasthan * Banwara, Rajasthan *Sodha, Rajasthan *Bhilwara, Rajasthan People talking to a saint at Ramdwara, Chhatribagh, Indore Smaller Ramdwara centres are located at various places in states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Delhi. Swami Ji Shree Ram Charan Ji Maharaj came to Shahpura from Bhilwara and did Tapasya (deep meditation). At the place where Swami Ram Charan Ji Maharaj's body was cremated, a giant Ramdwara has been built. This is now the chief Ramdwara of Ramsnehi Sampradaya. This Ramdwara is also called Ram Niwas Dhaam or Ram Niwas Baikunth Dhaam.  Construction  Barahdari of Ramdwara. The Shahpura Ramdwara was sponsored by the then King of Shahpura, Maharaja Amar Singh, and his brother Chattra Singh. It was built by constructors named Jarror Khan and Kushal Khan. This is also a great example of the brotherhood of Hindus and Muslims in India. All the marble stones used in construction were sourced from a place near the north border of nearby village named Kanti. There is a speciality in all used marble stones that each marble stone has a picture and stone mark on it as of Hindi (Devnagari) alphabets of the construction of word \\"Ram\\" (Lord Ram), bow, saint, India's map, sword, lion, monkey and other natural pictures. The main (and base) structure of Shahpura Ramdwara is an octagon shaped shiny marble pillar which is about 12 feet long. This pillar is situated at the cremation place of Ram Charan Maharaj. This pillar is called the Samadhi Stambh. The floor above the pillar is called Baradari (a kind of summer house with several open marble gates ). A rectangular stone is placed in the center of Baradari which is just over the main pillar. The Baradari has 108 small pillars which make 84 open gates. The construction was done in different phases.  Monks of Ramdwara  Monk of Ramdwara. The monks of RamSnehi Sampradaya are identical by their dressing code. They wear a robe coloured a very light pink. After taking oaths, monks can not return to their family and must treat the whole world equally and fairly, without any prejudices. They are supposed to follow all the defined rules strictly.  Way of worship and belief  Ramsnehis believe in the name of God (Ram ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ) and do not believe in idolatry. A Ramsnehi only follows the simple and easily defined rules. Ramsnehis just do Darshan of the chair of current Acharya and monks. They pay respects to all the previous (departed) acharyas and saints as well. Ram dhun- Evening chanting of Ram Ram at Ramdwara Shahpura, the main centre of Ramsnehi Sampradaya.

That is, the quantity of the product that producers wish to sell exceeds the quantity that potential buyers are willing to buy at the prevailing price. It is the opposite of an economic shortage (excess demand). In cultural evolution, agricultural surplus in the Neolithic period is theorized to have produced a greater division of labor, resulting in social stratification and class.  Prices  Prices and the occurrence of excess supply illustrate a strong correlation. When the price of a good is set too high, the quantity of the product demanded will be diminished while the quantity supplied will be enhanced, so there is more quantity supplied than quantity demanded. The occurrence of excess supply either leads to the lowering of the price or unsold supply, the latter reflecting excess supply. Lowering the price of a good encourages consumers to purchase more and suppliers to produce less.  Disequilibrium  A disequilibrium occurs due to a non-equilibrium price giving a lack of balance between supply and demand. Excess supply is one of the two types of disequilibrium in a perfectly competitive market, excess demand being the other. When quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded, the equilibrium level does not obtain and instead the market is in disequilibrium. An excess supply prevents the economy from operating efficiently.  Market response to excess supply  Excess supply in a perfectly competitive market is the \\"extra\\" amount of supply, beyond the quantity demanded. As an example, suppose the price of a television is $600, the quantity supplied at that price is 1000 televisions, and the quantity demanded is 300 televisions. This illustrates that sellers are seeking to sell 700 more televisions than buyers are willing to purchase. Hence, an excess supply of 700 televisions exists, indicating that the market is in a state of disequilibrium. In this situation, producers would not be able to sell all the televisions they produce at the desired price of $600. This will induce them to reduce their price in order to make the product more attractive for the buyers. In response to the reduction in the price of the product, consumers will increase their quantity demanded and producers will not produce as many as before. The market will eventually become balanced as the market is transitioning to an equilibrium price and quantity.  Market spillovers  Excess supply in one market can affect supply or demand in another market. For example, when there is excess supply in the labor market--that is, unemployment--consumer-laborers will be constrained in their disposable income and hence will demand a smaller quantity of goods at any given price. This diminished goods demand resulting from a constraint in another market is known as the effective demand for goods.

It was imported to Thailand in 1974. The name \\"eri\\" is derived from the Assamese word \\"era\\", which means \\"castor\\", as the silkworm feeds on castor plants. Another type of eri silk is \\"Ailanthus silk moth\\", refers to the host plant, Borkesseu, Ailanthus excelsa, practiced in China. Eri silk is also known as endi or errandi in India. The woolly white silk is often referred to as the fabric of peace when it is processed without killing the silkworm. This process results in a silk called Ahimsa silk. Moths leave the cocoon and then the cocoons are harvested to be spun. The eri silkworm is the only completely domesticated silkworm other than Bombyx mori. Process Rearing of Eri silk worm Eri caterpillars eat a number of plants, including Kesseru. In India, it is grown in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some small cities in other states. It has been grown in 28 provinces of Thailand since 1974. and The heavy rainfall and humid atmosphere of the region suits the eri culture. The spun threads are often more \\"cottony\\" than most Bombyx silks, although some eri yarns can be very soft and shiny. After 30‚Äì32 days, the silkworm crawls in search of a comfortable place among the leaves to spin its cocoon. In Thailand, eri silkworms are fed cassava leaves as well as castor leaves. Qualities Eri fiber, as seen in 7Weaves, Assam Eri silk is a staple fiber, unlike other silks, which are continuous filament. The texture of the fabric is coarse, fine, and dense. It is very strong, durable, and elastic. Eri silk is darker and heavier than other silks and blends well with wools and cotton. Due to its thermal properties it is warm in winter and cool in summer. Uses of eri silk fabric Eri silk clothes, as seen in 7Weaves, Assam Eri silk fabric is a boon for those who practice absolute non-violence, not using any product obtained by killing any animal. It is widely used by everyone in the regions in which it is produced. It is becoming popular the world over. Buddhist monks in India, Bhutan, Nepal, China, and Japan prefer this silk, due to its non-violent origins. In India, eri was mostly used for the preparation of winter shawls for men and women. The thermal properties of eri silk makes it a suitable fabric for shawls, jackets, blankets, and bed spreads. Dress materials and baby dresses are also made from eri silk fabric because of its soft texture and moisture absorbent quality. Nowadays very fine (up to 210 Nm eri spun yarns are available, which enables weavers to weave very fine clothing, including traditional sari dress materials. Eri silk is durable and strong and has a typical texture; hence, it is widely used in home furnishing like curtains, bed covers, cushion covers, wall hangings, quilts, etc. Its woolly feel adds to the comfort. Two eri spun-silk mills have been established in Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh and Kokrajhar in Assam while another is at Chaygaon, near Guwahati, Assam, which is spinning the finest Eri spun- silk yarn with various blends with bamboo, muga silk, and cotton. Eri silk products are promoted as eco-friendly and natural, and provide jobs and money for the tribal peoples who practice eri culture. Eri silk production in India during 2007‚Äì2008 was 1,530 tons. This made up 73 percent of the total wild silk production of 2,075 tons. Vegan designer Lucy Tammam uses eri silk in her couture evening and bridal wear collections.

One week after the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact's signing, the partition of Poland commenced with the German invasion of western Poland, followed by the Soviet Union's invasion of Eastern Poland on September 17, which included coordination with German forces. Negotiations In late 1939, both countries began discussions of creating a larger economic agreement than the 1939 German‚ÄìSoviet Trade Agreement. From the start of those negotiations, the Soviet Union made clear that it was willing to exchange its strategic maritime position for technology. The Soviets were willing to provide a northern base to the Germans, but not a busy seaport because it would provide an open indication of Soviet assistance of Germany, indicating that it was a co- belligerent. In October, the Soviets initially offered to provide a base to the west of Murmansk, which the Germans noted lacked anchorage shelter and facilities. The Soviets modified the offer to then undeveloped Zapadnaya Litsa, in the Motovsky Gulf on the Litsa Fjord at the westernmost point of the Kola Peninsula, which the Germans accepted. Base Operations=Need for secrecy While it made secret agreements with Germany for territorial division and military aid, the Soviet Union attempted to maintain a thin cloak of neutrality. As such, several options for the Soviet supply of German raiding ships that operated at the edge of international law were considered, such as having the German ships feign the capture of Soviet supply vessels as a \\"prize\\" (and then releasing them after the Germans retrieved supplies) or placing supplies at a transshipment point where the Germans would later retrieve them. The base at Zapadnaya Litsa, called \\"Basis Nord\\", had advantages with regard to secrecy. It was surrounded by Russian territory and closed to all foreign and Soviet domestic shipping, so that no one could see operations taking place. Its entrance also prevented observation from the open sea. Initial base conditions Germany knew that overt German fortification of Basis Nord was a political impossibility. The base at that time was entirely undeveloped, with no communications by rail or road and lacked access to potable water. Murmansk (120 kilometers away) had access to White Sea-Baltic Canal, but when the Germans arrived, Murmansk had not yet been developed and Gulag forced labor was still present constructing Soviet facilities. Germany initially procured the necessary supplies for its U-boats to use at the base and sent them first to Murmansk. It used the merchant ships Cordillera ()Hamburg-America at theshipslist.com ), Phoenicia ()) and () for these purposes. All three ships had been interned at Murmansk since the beginning of the war. Cordillera returned to Murmansk almost immediately in December 1939, and then traveled to Hamburg in February 1940. The Soviet Union's Arctic Fleet Command was informed by Moscow that the Germans were to be able to use the base to support their blockade of the British Isles. However, the British submarine sank , the initial submarine Germany sent to scout Basis Nord, in the Norwegian Sea, though the British did not know U-36 mission. later accomplished the scouting task despite interference by the Soviet torpedo boats and coast guard ships. Rumors In December 1939, western European media began to publish reported rumors of a northern German submarine base operating in the Soviet Union. Danish newspaper Nationaltidende, French magazine Paris-Soir and a French radio station reported rumors of a German submarine base, though they incorrectly identified the location. Germany dismissed the reports as unfounded rumors. Similar rumors surfaced in March 1940 in the Stockholm Daily Press.

Later it was salvaged.British and Other Navies in World War 2 Day-by-Day by Don Kindell In April 1940, Germany invaded Norway to attain a base for naval raiding in the North Atlantic, and to secure shipments of iron-ore from Sweden through the port of Narvik.The Illustrated History of World War II. Owen Booth and John Walton. Chartwell Books, Inc. 1998. Pages 44‚Äì49. Although the ships used were not launched from Basis Nord, the supply ship Jan Wellem, important for Narvik operations was sent from Basis Nord.One source indicates that the whale oil factory ship Jan Wellem also entered Basis Nord. Another source indicates that Jan Wellem departed Murmansk by the end of 6 April 1940 for Narvik harbor which she safety entered before Battles of Narvik started. No German U-boats or surface warships were supplied out of Basis Nord. On 1 May 1940, the Soviets offered a better anchorage point for Basis Nord at nearby Iokanga Bay. However, the German capture of Norway decreased the need for operations at Basis Nord, and it became more important as a symbol of cooperation than a base for significant operation. In April 1940, the Soviet Union withdrew its promises given with regard to Basis Nord.Memorandum by the German Ambassador in the Soviet Union (Schulenburg); April 11, 1940. Tgb. Nr.

The Post Tower is a 162.5-metre, 41-storey office building in Bonn, Germany. It was designed by German-American architect Helmut Jahn and won the 2002 Silver Emporis Skyscraper Award. It is the eleventh tallest skyscraper in Germany, and the tallest in Germany outside of Frankfurt am Main.  Building details  The building is located at the river Rhine and in the center of the old parliament area of Bonn near the Deutsche Welle and has about 55,000 m¬≤ office surface. Construction phase was May 2000 to December 2002, 80,000 m¬≥ of concrete and 16,000 tons of structural steel were used in the building shell. The building dimensions are; height: 162.5 m, width: 41.0 m, length: 81.1 m (with ring walls 86.55 m), weight: 300,000 t. The building has the ground floor, 40 upper floors and 5 underground levels. The Tower has a surface area of 7,000 m¬≤. The Tower is constructed as a steel-glass-building. The base of the Post Tower has the shape of two staggered semi-ellipses of two shifted circle segments. Most office walls, doors and the floors of skygardens and elevators are therefore made of 93,000 m¬≤ glass used.  Climate control concept  A double skin glass fa√ßade with about 1.2 m cavity between the external skin and the primary fa√ßade, provides natural ventilation regulated by venetian blinds. The north- facing windows at the front are smooth, the glass windows on the south-facing fa√ßade are gently sloping to allow a better flow of air (see picture). Via a decentralized underground convector, the external air is sucked in from the space between the fa√ßades, then it is conditioned and fed back into the offices. The air also reaches internal areas of the building through doors and corridors. The office air is filtered into the Sky Gardens, warms up those areas and then is filtered back outside via fa√ßade flaps on the east and west sides of the Sky Gardens. The double skin fa√ßade enables huge energy savings. The benefits gained by the Post Tower in using up to 130 liters of groundwater per second to heat and cool the concrete core. The remaining energy requirement is covered by connection to the district heating system, refrigerating equipment and heat pumps.

As an expert, he had already designed thirty devices such as paddy dryers and water pumps which can be used by low-income Filipino farmers. Belonio concentrated on innovating the rice husk oven even though the concept was not a new one, because there was already the so-called Lo Trao from Vietnam. The difference was that Belonio's invention does not produce smoke and has a stable fire without a tar-like residue. Belonio used good engineering and ample ventilation for his stove, which is characterized by a small fan that is powered either by grid electricity or batteries, producing a more efficient burn of the rice husks.Telis, Gisela Angela. Rice-powered stove ignites new hope for poor farmers, Innovation, The Christian Science Monitor, CSMonitor.com, December 3, 2008 Belonio's first ovens cost $100 (or around ‚Ç±5,000) each, but due to further development and research, he was able to lower the price to $25 (or around ‚Ç±1,250) each. The only expected expense for the user of the oven would be 20 cents per day for running the built-in fan inside the stove. The invention is currently being produced by companies in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Cambodia, all cooperating with Belonio's works. According to Belonio his stove would be able to save a family of rice farmers $150 per year in fuel expenses. He also added that a ton of rice husk contains energy equal to 415 liters of petroleum (or 378 liters of kerosene). Belonio's stove lessens toxic fumes and smoke that affect the environment, and reduces greenhouse gases. The burnt remnants of the rice husks can later be used as soil fertilizers or in making small blocks of coal substitute. Description Belonio's rice husk stove is a small cylinder equipped with a fan in its base, which provides air during the conversion of rice hulls into gas. It was designed as an apparatus that can be easily operated. Fish can be fried in fifteen minutes using the stove. The stove consumes 2 kilograms of rice husks per hour. It does not produce any smoke, and the burnt rice husks can still be used as coal and also as insulating cement for traditional stoves fueled by wood. Plans for the stove are available free of charge from the internet.Alexis Belonio - 2008 Associate Laureate , Rolexawards.com, 2008 ReferencesExternal links *Alexis Belonio and his inventions, with photographs and descriptions, BioEnergy Lists: Biomass Cooking Stoves, Bionenergylists.org *Alexis Belonio - 2008 Associate Laureate, with photographs of Belonio and his invention, Rolexawards.com *Alexis Belonio Rice Husk Quasi Gasifier Stove, photographs and descriptions, Bioenergylists.org *Alexis Belonio, Luminous Hope, a quotation from Alexis Belonio, Rolexawards.com *Alexis Belonio and his inventions, Bioenergylists.com *Alexis Belonio, Associate Laureate, photographs, Recent Headlines, For the Media, Rolex Awards for Enterprise, Resnicow Schroeder, Resnicowschroeder.com *Tradition of innovation, (...) \\"Five runners-up, the Associate Laureates, will each receive $50,000 (Dh183,690) and a steel and gold Rolex chronometer.

Australian securities regulation rests on the principle that \\"financial markets cannot function effectively unless participants act with integrity and there is adequate disclosure to facilitate informed judgements\\".Commonwealth of Australia Financial System Inquiry Final Report (1997) p. 16. As a result, many of the regulatory rules governing dealings in securities are part of a broader framework that governs financial products, financial services and financial markets. Mandatory disclosure and conduct regulation underlie much of Australia's securities regulation. False trading, fraudulent dealing, and insider trading are dealt with to prevent improper practices in connection with securities markets. A licensing system operates to ensure securities markets are fair, orderly and transparent. At the same time, securities law is also facilitative, allocating rights and duties in conjunction with general contract law. It also allows for a degree of self-regulation, by the operation for example of an independent securities exchange. Australian securities law has been substantially modernised in recent years. The core of these laws are found in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), which contains provisions governing takeovers, fundraising, and financial products, services and markets.  Legal and regulatory framework  The main body of substantive law about securities is found in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), as well as the regulations made under that Act. Whilst much of the law is derived from earlier regulation (especially the bust in Australian mineral stocks of the late 1960s), the sections relating to securities regulation have been subject to recent amendment. The takeovers provisions were substantially re-written by the Corporation Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999. Changes to financial products, financial markets, and financial services were introduced by the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (Cth), as a result of the Final Report of the Financial System Inquiry, commonly referred to as \\"the Wallis report.\\" Elements of securities law are also found in the general law governing contracts, trusts, and torts. Securities regulation under the Corporations Act operates against the background of other Commonwealth legislation on criminal law, administrative law,Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977; Freedom of Information Act 1982; Privacy Act 1988. and statutory interpretation.Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Administration of the legislation is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Treasurer and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), according to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) and the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The market operator Australian Stock Exchange also has an important regulatory role to play. The resolution of disputes is confided to the Federal Court and the Supreme Courts of the States and the Northern Territory, with other courts having some powers to apply the securities legislation.  Definitions  A security is \\"a thing in action\\", a claim enforceable by legal proceedings rather than owning some tangible property. To effect regulation the legislation adopts various definitions of \\"security\\" and \\"financial product\\" that are used. There is also no law which stipulates that no person in which authority is not given (anyone other the law enforcement or owners of an establishment) may restrict persons entering and leaving a premises.  Licensing  Only the holder of a market licence may operate a financial market.Corporations Act 2001, s 791A.  Financial intermediaries  A person who carries on a financial services business in the jurisdiction must hold an Australian financial services licence.Corporations Act, s 911A(1).

Britton Plaza Shopping Center is a open-air shopping plaza in the Fair Oaks - Manhattan Manor neighborhood of Tampa, Florida (on the corner of Dale Mabry Highway and Euclid Avenue). The plaza was built in 1956 and includes these anchors: Publix Super Market, Bealls Outlet, Tuesday Morning, Stein Mart, Burlington Coat Factory, Marshall's, Michaels, and Big Lots, as well as a GNC, Taco Bell, and a variety of local stores including The Perfect Gift which opened in 2011. The plaza also has an eight-screen theater, operated by Five Star Cinemas, which reopened in August 2009.. The theater was previously operated by Regal Entertainment in the mid-1990s and later Zota Theatres during the early and mid-2000s. Additionally, Fashion Bug closed its Britton Plaza store in March 2009, and China Garden Super Buffet closed its doors in June to prepare for an expansion. It reopened as the Tampa Buffet on November 29, 2009 and includes expanded dining facilities and buffet selection. In February 2011, Walgreens moved across the street; (Pet Supermarket will occupy the former space during the first quarter of 2012), and in April 2011, Plato's Closet opened in the old Fashion Bug storefront (the other half of the former Fashion Bug storefront has been occupied by Five Dollar Fashions since 2009). History The landmark Britton Plaza sign on Dale Mabry Highway. When the shopping center opened in 1956, Publix was among the original tenants, along with several other stores, including, J.C. Penney, National Shirt Shops, W.T. Grant, Neisners, Thom McAn, Jarman Shoes, Baker Shoes, Western Auto, Continental House and Rexall Drugs to name a few. The entire plaza was decorated in 1950s art-deco styling and included a nicely decorated courtyard. An elaborate sign, reminiscent of the old Florida style was erected alongside Dale Mabry Highway and still stands today. The movie theater, originally operated By General Cinema, consisted of one screen and later was expanded to two screens. The building currently housing Burlington Coat Factory was opened in the mid-1960s as a Belk Lindsay store which replaced one in Ybor City. In later years it was converted to a J Byron store, followed by an Uptons store in the mid-1990s. In 1987, Publix closed its Britton Plaza location, with Idaho-based Albertsons moving into the space at the plaza a couple years later. Albertsons helped reshape Britton Plaza to what it is today by undertaking a renovation and expansion of the old Publix space. Publix has now taken over the Albertson's store at Britton Plaza. The entire plaza was renovated to today's appearance during the course of the late 1980s. The movie theater expanded to eight screens and underwent a renovation of its own in 1992. In 2001, Regal Entertainment, which operated the theater for several years during the 1990s, pulled out of Britton Plaza, further signaling the decline of smaller cinemas and the growth of larger cineplexes. Not long after, Frank's Nursery and Gardens closed down and its building was demolished, making way for a plaza extension in 2003 that brought Michaels and Marshall's to the plaza, as well as the return of Big Lots, which previously sat in the space now occupied by Tuesday Morning. In 2006, Zota Theaters took over the cinema space, hoping for a turnaround in the plaza's movie going business. 2008 signaled a shake-up of sorts for Britton Plaza. The deteriorating economic climate had forced several businesses to close down, including a few local stores. In June of that year, Publix announced that it was purchasing 49 Albertsons stores in Florida, including the Britton Plaza location. When the deal closed in September, Albertsons vacated the plaza and renovation work began a month later. Just days before Albertsons' departure from the plaza, Zota Theaters announced it was pulling out as well. The company was unable to gain steady patrons and compete with bigger movie houses such as the AMC WestShore 14 at nearby WestShore Plaza. With the \\"reopening\\" of Publix on January 8, 2009, and re-opening of the 8-screen movie theater, it seems that Britton Plaza has turned the corner despite the ongoing recession. Additionally, several new businesses had opened in the plaza since 2009; including Arbys, Five Dollar Fashions, Plato's Closet, The Perfect Gift, and the Missing Piece. HART Transfer Center Hillsborough Area Regional Transit (HART) operates a transfer center at Britton Plaza. Routes 4, 19, 36, and 89, as well as Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority's Route 100X, transfer at a shelter structure in the center of the plaza's parking lots.

These trade barriers may take the form of import or export taxes on products that have a large carbon footprint or are imported from countries with lax environmental regulations.Kraus, Christiane (2000), Import Tariffs as Environmental Policy Instruments, Springer, ,  International trade vs. environmental degradation  There has been debate on the role that increased international trade has played in increasing pollution.Horvath, John Salami Tactics, Telepolis, at Heise.de online, 2000. Retrieved 2009-10-14. While some maintain that increases in pollution which result in both local environmental degradation and a global tragedy of the commons are intimately linked to increases in international trade, others have argued that as citizens become more affluent they'll also advocate for cleaner environments. According to a World Bank paper: : \\"Since freer trade raises income, it directly contributes to increasing pollution levels via the scale effect. However, it thereby induces the composition (and) technique effects of increased income, both of which tend to reduce pollution levels\\".Trade, Global Policy, and the Environment, Pg. 56, Fredriksson, World Bank, World Bank Publications, 1999, , Dean, Judith M & Lovely, Mary E (2008), Trade Growth, Production Fragmentation, and China's Environment, Pgs. 3 & 5, National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper 13860, Cambridge, MA [2] Proponents of environmental tariff implementation have highlighted that if implemented correctly, the tariff could serve to stop strategic behavior of foreign nations and return efficient economic policy in the foreign country. Additionally, environmental standards will be harmonized between the trading nations as a result of the environmental tariff. One of the major issues that are raised when discussing environmental tariffs, is the issue of a reduction in trade. The argument raised is that tariffs reduce trade and may not actually be targeting the actual source of the pollution. They argue that pollution is not just as a result of imported goods but a large part of pollution suffered occurs within the borders of a country, therefore trade would merely harming trade without actually addressing the root cause effectively.  Early tariff implementation proposal  Although the United States has in the past been accused of dragging its feet on implementing tough new anti-pollution measures, it was the originator of a legislative proposal suggesting an environmental tariff be applied against exporting countries whose exports gained significant cost advantages due to less stringent environmental regulations. The proposed legislation was tabled as the International Pollution Deterrence Act of 1991 and was introduced in its Senate in April of that year.International Trade and Climate Change: Economic, Legal, and Institutional Perspectives Pg. 36, World Bank Publications, 2007, ,  Doha Ministerial Declaration  Negotiations took place in 2001 Doha, Qatar towards the improvement of work related issues concerning the implementation of present agreements. This was a mandated conference dubbed the Fourth Ministerial Conference. One of the issues discussed concerned the issues of trade barriers on environmental goods and services. The result of which was ministers agreeing to a reduction or complete removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services such as catalytic converters and air filters to name a few.  Proposed International Pollution Control Index  A notable feature of the proposed U.S. International Pollution Deterrence Act was the international pollution control index it cited within its Section 5, which read:S 984 IS: International Pollution Deterrence Act of 1991 (Introduced in Senate) U.S. Congress Thomas online database, 102nd Congress, 1st session, 25 April 1991. Retrieved 2009-06-07 > INTERNATIONAL POLLUTION CONTROL INDEX > Section 8002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6982) is amended by > adding the following new subsections at the end thereof: \`(t) The > Administrator shall prepare, within one hundred and twenty days of the > enactment of this section and yearly thereafter, a pollution control index > for each of the top fifty countries identified by the Office of Trade and > Investment of the Department of Commerce based on the value of exports to > the United States from that country's attainment of pollution control > standards in the areas of air, water, hazardous waste and solid waste as > compared to the United States.

The Administrator shall analyze, in > particular, the level of technology employed and actual costs incurred for > pollution control in the major export sectors of each country in formulating > the index.  Implementation problems and resistance  Environmental tariffs may result in the movement in production of goods to areas in which stricter environmental standards are enforced. Environment tariffs were not implemented in the past, in part, because they were not sanctioned by multilateral trade regimes such as the World Trade Organization and within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a fact which generated considerable criticism and calls for reform. Moreover, the GATT does condone the use of tariffs as market interventions, so long as the interventions do not discriminate products, both foreign and domestic. A disputed case relating to this policy was brought forth to the GATT/WTO, involving the U.S. and Canada over Canadian environmental regulations on beverage containers. Additionally, many foreign factory owners in newly industrialized countries and underdeveloped countries saw the attempts to impose pollution controls on them as suspicious... : \\"...seeing it as a threat to their growth and fearing that developed countries would attempt to export their preferences for pollution control or to place 'environmental' tariffs on imports from countries with lower standards.\\"Leonard, Jeffrey H., 1988, Pollution and the Struggle for the World Product: Multinational Corporations, Environment, and International Comparative Advantage Pg. 69, Cambridge University Press, , 9780521340427 Moreover, the problem of what the ideal tariff level is also a cause for concern when implementing environmental tariffs. Further implementation problems have been as a result of what some developing nations may view as green protectionism.
