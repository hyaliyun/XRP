He later received a Masters of Divinity degree from The Master's Seminary.Biography. ralphdrollinger.com Basketball Drollinger played basketball at Grossmont High School and was the CIF Southern Section MVP, as his team won the 1972 CIF championship as a high school All-American. He was a 7'2\\" (2.19 m) and 250 lb (114 kg) center and played collegiately at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He was the first player in NCAA history to go to four Final Four tournaments. He played for two national championship teams under coach John Wooden and after his first season, won the Seymour Armond Award as UCLA's most outstanding freshman. In his junior and senior years he was an Academic All-American. Drollinger also played on America' World Cup Basketball team in 1978. Drollinger was taken in the NBA Draft three times. He chose to forgo the NBA during those years to instead play with Athletes in Action, an evangelistic basketball team that toured the world and preached the gospel at halftimes and represented America in the 1978 FIBA World Championship. He was selected with the 17th pick in the seventh round in 1976 by the Boston Celtics, with the 1st pick of the eighth round in 1977 by the New York Nets, and finally with the 17th pick of the fifth round in 1978 by the Seattle SuperSonics. Drollinger was the first Dallas Maverick ever in the history of the then new NBA franchise. He signed with the Dallas Mavericks in June 1980 as a free agent before they had hired Dick Motta as the head coach, motivated by his desire to attend Dallas Theological Seminary during his playing days. He played in only six games due to a knee injury which led to his retirement from basketball in March 1981. In the Mavs' inaugural season in 1980‚Äì81, he averaged 2.5 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. Some years later after his retirement, Dr. James Dobson invited Drollinger to play in an early morning pick up game with Pete Maravich. That morning Maravich collapsed in the middle of the game from a massive heart attack. Dobson and Drollinger administered CPR, but to no avail; Maravich was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. He was selected as one of the Fabulous 50 Basketball Players by the San Diego Hall of Champions in 2011. Sports ministry After his brief injury-plagued professional career, Drollinger founded and participated in a variety of sports related ministries. He helped found and was the Executive Director of Sports Outreach America, an umbrella trade organization of American church and parachurch sports ministries, such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Athletes in Action, and Pro Athletes Outreach. He founded Sports Spectrum Magazine, a bi- monthly print magazine that features the testimony of Christian athletes, the \\"Path To Victory\\" Sports New Testament in conjunction with Biblica, He also founded, produced and financed Julius Erving's Sports Focus, a weekly one-half hour television anthology on ESPN featuring the testimony of Christian athletes and hosted by NBA player Julius Erving.

Routledge, 2005. page 158 and the lynching of teenager Michael Donald in Mobile in 1981. Because of murder charges and convictions, some of the UKA's most well-known members included Thomas E. Blanton, Jr., Bobby Frank Cherry, Herman Cash, Robert Chambliss, Bennie Hays, Henry Hays, and James Knowles. Robert Shelton died at the age of 73 in 2003 in Tuscaloosa from a heart attack. In 1987 the UKA was sued for civil damages stemming from the murder of Michael Donald; the damages awarded by the jury bankrupted the organization. Many former members of the group now purportedly belong to other Ku Klux Klan organizations such as The True Ku Klux Klan. History During the Civil Rights Movement in the Southern United States, members of the United States Klan and the KKK joined forces in 1960 in order to resist and suppress change. In July 1961, Robert Shelton, the son of a member of the KKK, settled in Alabama after his discharge from the Air Force. He rose to become the dominant figure or the Imperial Wizard, of the UKA after his \\"Alabama Knights\\" group merged with the \\"Invisible Empire, United Klans, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of America, Inc.\\", Georgia Knights, and Carolina Units, forming the United Klans of America (UKA). The increase in activism in the 1965s resulted in the UKA reaching a peak of active members and sympathetic support, with numbers estimated at 26,000 to 33,000 throughout the South in 1965. It was the largest KKK faction in the world, in a highly decentralized organization. The organization was most popular in North Carolina, where by 1966 over half of all UKA members resided. The UKA disseminated its messages through a newsletter known as The Fiery Cross, which was printed in Swartz, Louisiana. But, membership began to slip once the group was linked to criminal activity, and after Shelton served a one-year term in prison for contempt of the United States Congress in 1969. In the early 1970s, UKA membership dropped from tens of thousands to somewhere between 3500 and 4000. Some members continued to enact violence. By the 1980s, membership dropped to around 900. In the 1990s the UKA experienced a resurgence of activity of members who returned to teachings of the Imperial Wizard, Col. William Joseph Simmons, who had founded and led the second Ku Klux Klan from 1915 to 1939. Simmons taught a kind of fraternal organization that is practiced by the UKA in the 21st century. It has several Klaverns active in twenty nine states, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The UKA's membership is not precisely known. Its leadership is believed to be weak and its activities are limited to ceremonial practices with no clear political agenda. 16th Street bombing The 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama had a strong congregation and was a center of activism for many people involved in the Civil Rights Movement in the city, including members of the SCLC who came to help with organizing. Many marchers departed from the church in 1963 protests against the city's segregation of businesses and public places. On a Sunday in September 1963, a bomb exploded in the church during services, killing four young girls: 11-year-old Denise McNair, 14-year-old Carole Robertson, 14-year-old Cynthia Wesley, and 14-year-old Addie Mae Collins. More than 20 other parishioners were injured. Addie Mae Collin's sister lost an eye from injuries of the bombing. Witnesses said they saw a white man put a box underneath the Church steps after getting out of his Chevrolet car. The police arrested Robert Chambliss, a member of the UKA, after he was identified by a witness, and charged him with murder, in addition to \\"‚Ä¶possessing a box of 122 sticks of dynamite without a permit.\\" The trial took place in October, but Chambliss was not convicted of murder. He did receive a fine of one hundred dollars and six months in jail for possession of the dynamite. He was tried again when Bill Baxley, the state attorney general of Alabama, realized that much of the evidence that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had against Chambliss was not used in his original trial. The state tried Chambliss, who in 1977 was convicted of the murder of the four girls, and he was sentenced to life in prison at 73 years old, where he eventually died. Chambliss never confessed to the bombing. On May 16, 2000, the remaining suspects were indicted. The jury convicted UKA members Robert Chambliss, Thomas E. Blanton, Jr., and Bobby Frank Cherry of planting the 19 sticks of dynamite that were used in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church. In 2001, Thomas E. Blanton, Jr., was sentenced to life in prison following his trial, in which he was charged with murder. In 2002, Bobby Frank Cherry also was tried for murder and he, too, received life in prison. Murder of Viola Liuzzo In 1965, 39-year-old Viola Liuzzo, a white woman from the North, decided to help support the movement for voting rights in Selma, Alabama. She assisted the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in a variety of ways. During the third march, in which thousands of people came to Selma to participate, she helped drive marchers to catch up with the walkers along the route, as it took a few days. Finally she drove marchers back to Selma after the completion of the march to the capital, Montgomery. On March 25, 1965, as she was making her last trip to Montgomery with 19-year-old Leroy Moton to pick up the marchers, four members of the UKA saw Liuzzo sitting at a red light with Moton, a young African American. They followed the pair in their car, eventually driving up beside her, and shot at the car. Moton survived the shots, pretending to be dead, but Liuzzo died of her wounds. Collie Wilkins, William Orville Eaton, Eugene Thomas, and Gary Thomas Rowe were taken into custody the next day. Wilkins, Eaton, and Thomas each were convicted under the new Civil Rights Law of 1964, receiving 10-year prison sentences. Rowe was revealed as an informant for the FBI. Lynching of Michael Donald The acquittal of a black man accused of shooting a white police officer in Alabama in 1981 was the erstwhile \\"reason\\" given by murderers for the lynching of Michael Donald, a 19-year-old black man, on March 21, after Josephus Andersonan, a black man in Mobile, Alabama, was charged with the murder of a white police officer but acquitted at trial. UKA member Bennie Hays blamed the jury, claiming the acquittal was due to the presence of African-American members. Hays said he would kill a black man in retaliation. On March 21, his son Henry Hays, and another younger member of the UKA, James Knowles, decided to take action and drove around to find a victim. They found Michael Donald walking along the street and made him get into their car. After kidnapping him, they drove out to a bordering county, where Hays and Knowles hanged him from a tree. During the investigation, the police concluded that the murder had to do with drugs, but Donald's mother, Beulah Mae Donald, knew her son was not involved with drugs, and decided to take action. She eventually talked to national activist Jesse Jackson of Chicago. Thomas Figures, Mobile's U.S. Attorney, contacted the FBI to take on the case under federal civil rights law. Knowles quickly confessed to the lynching. In 1983, James Knowles of the UKA's Klavern 900 in Mobile, was convicted for the 1981 murder of Michael Donald. His conviction resulted in a sentence of life in prison; he was given mercy as he was 17 at the time of the killing. At trial Knowles said that he and Henry Hays killed Donald \\"in order to show Klan strength in Alabama\\". In 1987, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) brought a civil case on behalf Donald's family against the United Klans of America for being responsible in the lynching of Donald. Unable to come up with the $7 million in damages awarded by the jury, the UKA was forced to turn over its national headquarters to Donald's mother, who sold the property.Morris Dees and Steve Fiffer. Hate on Trial: The Case Against America's Most Dangerous Neo-Nazi. Villard Books, 1993. page 11 This lawsuit resulted in the bankruptcy of the UKA. The organization split up in 1987. During the civil trial, Knowles said that he was \\"carrying out the orders\\" of Bennie Jack Hays, Henry Hays's father, and a long time Shelton lieutenant. The trial ended with a guilty verdict, and Knowles, charged with \\"‚Ä¶violating Donald's civil rights‚Ä¶\\", received a sentence of life in prison. Hays was charged a few months later with the murder of Donald, he was found guilty, and sentenced to death. Hays was executed on 6 June 1997. Other activities On June 29, 2013, leaflets were left overnight in the driveways of several homes in Burien, Washington, 10 miles south of Seattle. They bore the message, \\"The United Klans of America (UKA) Neighborhood Watch. You can sleep well tonight knowing the UKA is awake!\\" In the spring of 1979, 20 UKA members were indicted in Birmingham, Alabama for violent racial episodes in Talladega County, Alabama. Three members pleaded guilty, while 10 others were found guilty. One of the violent racial episodes included, \\"...firing into the homes of officers of the NAACP\\". In the 1990s the UKA experienced a resurgence in the activity of its members who returned to the teachings of the Imperial Wizard, Col. William Joseph Simmons, who founded and led the second Ku Klux Klan from 1915 to 1939. Under Simmons' leadership, the second Klan operated as a fraternal organization, a style that is still practiced by the UKA in the 21st century. It has several active Klaverns in twenty nine states, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The UKA's membership is not precisely known. Its leadership is believed to be weak and its activities are limited to ceremonial practices with no clear political agenda. In 1998, a complaint was filed against Roy Frankhouser, Grand Dragon of the UKA in Pennsylvania. He had been harassing Bonnie Jouhari, a white woman who worked at the Reading-Berks Human Relations Council in the state of Pennsylvania. Her job was to help people who had been targeted and discriminated against. Frankhouser threatened her and her daughter, Pilar D. Horton. After she unsuccessfully tried to sue Frankhouser,David Bernstein. You Can't Say That! The Growing Threat to Civil Liberties from Antidiscrimination Laws. Cato Institute, 2003. page 74 the SPLC decided to represent Jouhari. The case ended with Frankhouser having to complete community service, making a public apology to Jouhari and her daughter, and completing a certain number of hours in sensitivity training. During the summer of 2013, leaflets purporting to be from the UKA were found in Milford, Connecticut. The leaflets advertised a neighborhood watch, telling residents they can \\"sleep soundly\\" knowing the UKA is on patrol. These actions were condemned by town and state leadership. On June 29, 2013 leaflets bearing the same message were also left overnight in the driveways of several homes in Burien, Washington, 10 miles south of Seattle. The incident was reported to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Burien Police. According to a regional Anti-Defamation League official, the incarnation of the UKA responsible for the flyers was unconnected to the older, defunct organization.

Its four Australian branches are located on the RMIT University campuses in Melbourne City, Bundoora and Brunswick; and its two Vietnamese branches are located at the RMIT University Vietnam campuses in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. History The antecedent to RMIT's University Library network was established as the library of the Working Men's College of Melbourne (antecedent to present-day RMIT) in 1890. The tiny library was initially housed in a 6 x 9 m room in Building 1 and contained only 152 m of shelf space. It was managed by the college's mathematics instructor Alfred Hart between 1902-1930, a leading Shakespearian of his day. From the 1930s, the library was expanded and relocated to the space beneath the public lecture theatre of Building 1 (what is today the Pearson and Murphy's caf√©). During this time, it was primarily staffed by repatriated World War I soldiers as part of a federal government re-skilling program. By 1945, the library had outgrown its space and the decision was made to split it into specific field collections. From then the various collections were housed in the schools relevant to each field. In 1955, a central library was re-established in Building 6 - following ongoing requests from the student union. And, in 1956, John Livingstone Ward was appointed as RMIT's first chief librarian. Some schools continued to maintain research collections, in addition to the central library.

In 1993, the main library was relocated to Building 8 and was further expanded - after which it was known as the Swanston Library. The second library became known as the Carlton Library. Two more libraries were added to the network when the Bundoora campus opened in 1995 - Bundoora East Library and Bundoora West Library. When the Brunswick campus was annexed by RMIT in 1999, the Brunswick Library also became part of the network.

As Bosch crosses paths with FBI Agent Rachel Walling, the novel ties story elements left unresolved in The Poet and those from Blood Work and A Darkness More Than Night together into the Bosch mythos. Plot summary While investigating the death of ex-FBI profiler Terry McCaleb at his wife's request, Bosch begins to suspect that notorious serial killer and ex-FBI supervisor Robert Backus, aka The Poet, presumed dead, may have murdered McCaleb. Digging deeper, Bosch follows a lead to Las Vegas that brings him into contact with the FBI. Meanwhile, FBI agent Rachel Walling, who was at one time Backus's prot√©g√© in the FBI (as McCaleb had also been) and who has been exiled by the FBI to South Dakota for four years for her role in The Poet investigation, is the subject of messages sent by Backus to the FBI. As Bosch and Walling are both outsiders to the main FBI investigation, they eventually join forces. The novel shifts points of view, cutting from Bosch's first- person commentary to the third-person perspectives of Walling and Backus. Bosch meets a neighbor whom he later discovers (in the book The Closers) to be Cassie Black, the main character of Void Moon, and he begins a relationship with Walling. He also accepts an offer from his old partner Kiz Rider to rejoin the LAPD under a new chief of police, as a homicide detective in the Open-Unsolved Unit within the department's Robbery-Homicide Division. In the end, Bosch and Walling bring The Poet to justice by chasing him into the concrete channels of the swollen Los Angeles River in L.A., where he drowns while Bosch barely survives. His death is confirmed this time, as opposed to The Poet where he was merely presumed dead. However, the relationship between Bosch and Walling falls apart in the end when Bosch learns that the FBI had discovered that Backus had nothing to do with McCaleb's death but had withheld the information from him. In fact, McCaleb had killed himself in a manner to make his death look accidental, as his heart transplant was failing, and he did not want to burden his wife and children with the crippling expense of additional medical procedures. 2004 American novels Harry Bosch series Novels set in Los Angeles Little, Brown and Company books ","title":"The Narrows (Connelly novel)"},{"id":"12902859","text":"Oncoba ovalis is a species of plant in the Salicaceae family.

He played five seasons as a right- handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Naps from 1910 to 1914. He pitched a six-hit shutout against Walter Johnson in his Major League debut in September 1910. His best seasons were 1912 and 1913, during which time he compiled a record of 33-24. His career record with Cleveland was 46-46. Before playing for Cleveland, Blanding was the ace on a pitching staff that led the 1909 Michigan Wolverines baseball team to an 18-3-1 record. Blanding also played amateur baseball for the Detroit Athletic Club and won 20 games for the San Antonio Bronchos of the Texas League in 1910. In 1914, Blanding was placed into the middle of a baseball war between the established leagues and the outlaw Federal League. After signing a three-year contract with the Kansas City Packers of the Federal League, Blanding opted to return to the American League after Cleveland offered to pay him a salary reported to be in excess of $10,000. Blanding was sued by the Kansas City team, and the Cleveland team argued that Blanding remained bound to play for them under the reserve clause in his 1913 contract. Blanding was allowed to play for Cleveland in 1914, which proved to be his last season in professional baseball. After retiring from baseball, Blanding operated an early Ford Motor Company dealership and service center in Lansing, Michigan. He later operated an automobile business in Roanoke, Virginia, during the 1930s and 1940s. Early years Blanding was born in Redlands, California, in 1888. His father, Fred J. Blanding, Sr., died while Blanding was a child. Blanding moved to Michigan with his mother, who was a Michigan native. At the time of the 1900 United States Census, Blanding was 12 years old and living on a farm in Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan, with his mother Emma Blanding, grandparents George W. and Jane (Clendenning) Sly, and sister Charlotte. His mother was listed in the 1900 Census as a widow.Census entry for Frederick Blanding, born February 1888. Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Census Place: Bloomfield, Oakland, Michigan; Roll: 735; Page: 19B; Enumeration District: 82; FHL microfilm: 1240735.United States Census, 1900,\\" index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MS9K-TQ7 : accessed 18 June 2012), Frederick Blanding in household of George Sly, ED 82 Bloomfield township Birmingham village, Oakland, Michigan, United States. Erroneously lists Fred as having been born in Michigan. Blanding attended Detroit Central High School where he played baseball. Amateur baseball After graduating from high school, Blanding enrolled at the University of Michigan as an engineering student. He attended the University from 1907 to 1909. During the spring of 1909, he played college baseball as a pitcher for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team.Game accounts of Blanding's games for the Michigan Wolverines can be found in The Michigan Alumnus, May and June 1909, at pages 349 to 414. Blanding was the ace on a pitching staff that led the 1909 Wolverines to an 18-3-1 record. Blanding struck out 64 batters in 13 games for Michigan.1910 Michiganensian, page 238. After graduating from Michigan, Blanding played amateur baseball for the Detroit Athletic Club team during the last half of the 1909 season. A newspaper article in September 1909 noted: \\"Fred Blanding, the human catapult from the University of Michigan, was on the firing line for the DAC. To most clubs, Fred's very name breathes terror.\\" Professional baseball =Minor leagues= Although Blanding was officially an amateur for the Michigan Wolverines and D.A.C. in 1909, he confessed in March 1911 that he had also played professional baseball that summer in the Central Kansas League under an assumed name, though he refused to disclose the identify of the club. According to Baseball-Reference.com, Blanding played for the Ellsworth Worthies in the Central Kansas League. Blanding began the 1910 baseball season with a team in Aberdeen, but the franchise folded. Blanding next joined the San Antonio Bronchos in the Texas League. Blanding appeared in 30 games for San Antionio and compiled a record of 20 wins and 9 losses while pitching 230 innings. =Cleveland Naps= After his strong showing in the Texas League, Blanding was drafted by the Cleveland Naps and joined the team late in the 1910 season. On September 15, 1910, Blanding appeared in his first game in Major League Baseball. With Walter Johnson as the opposing pitcher, Blanding threw a six-hit shutout and led the Indians to a 3-0 victory. Four days later, Blanding secured his second victory against the Philadelphia Athletics and surviving a Philadelphia rally in the ninth inning: \\"This made Blanding's second start in the big show ... The big fellow needed all his nerve in the ninth, when a double and a single after one man had died gave the foe a run ...\\" In October 1910, Blanding also won the tying game in the post-season series between Cleveland and the Cincinnati Reds. In 1911, Blanding spent the season with Cleveland and compiled a 7-11 record in 29 games. In July 1922, Blanding was praised in the press for his \\"manly qualities in makeup\\" after he asked the Cleveland team president Somers to allow him to return to the minor leagues. Blanding told Somers that \\"he felt that he was not giving value received for his salary and that in justice to the team he thought he had better go back to a minor league.\\" Somers declined the offer, told Blanding to put the defeats behind him and expressed confidence that Blanding would \\"shake off his hoo-doo.\\" In 1912, he posted a record of 18‚Äì14 with 23 complete games in 262 innings pitched. His earned run average in 1912 was 2.92 ‚Äî well below the league average of 3.44. His Adjusted ERA+ was 118. Blanding had another strong season in 1913, going 15‚Äì10 with an ERA of 2.55 and an Adjusted ERA+ of 118. He opened the 1913 season with a 12-4 record. After Blanding pitched a complete game shutout against the Detroit Tigers in April 1913, E. A. Batchelor wrote in the Detroit Free Press that Blanding was \\"not so brilliant in his display of speed and curves,\\" but \\"he had one of those dinky curves,\\" that, with control, was enough to beat the Tigers. At the end of the 1913 season, Sporting Life editor Ed Bang wrote of Blanding: \\"Fritz has always proved himself a willing worker and game to the core.\\" =Federal League= In January 1914, Blanding signed with the Kansas City Packers of the inaugural season of play in the new Federal League. The Packers were co-owned by Charles A. Baird, who had been the athletic director at the University of Michigan while Blanding was a student. However, one week after signing with the Packers, Blanding opted to return to Cleveland after the Naps offered a higher salary. The Sporting Life reported in March 1914 that Cleveland had agreed to pay Blanding more than $10,000 for the 1914 season. As the American and National Leagues fought to prevent the new league from signing or retaining established stars, officials of the Federal League, referred to as \\"the outlaw organization,\\" threatened a \\"baseball war.\\" In March 1914, after learning that Blanding had returned to Cleveland, the president of the Federal League sent an ultimatum to the American and National Leagues \\"to keep their hands off players already under contract to Federal league clubs.\\" In April 1914, Blanding became a poster child for the developing baseball war as the Kansas City team filed a lawsuit seeking $10,000 and an injunction prohibiting Blanding from playing for Cleveland or any club other than Kansas City. The Kansas City team alleged that Blanding had signed a three-year contract at an annual salary of $5,833 and that Blanding had been paid a $2,500 advance. According to the suit, Blanding \\"jumped\\" his contract to return to Cleveland. Attorneys for the Cleveland baseball team appeared at the injunction hearing and sought to justify their claim over Blanding \\"by the plea that the reserve clause in his 1913 contract with the Naps held him legally to that club and maintained that he had no right to sign the Kansas City contract.\\" =1914 season= Blanding returned to Cleveland for the 1914 season. Although the team included Nap Lajoie and Shoeless Joe Jackson, manager Joe Birmingham was in a feud with Lajoie and the 1914 Naps finished with the worst record in franchise history, 51 wins and 102 losses for a .333 winning percentage. Blanding was used principally as a reliever in 1914 and compiled a record of 4-9. According to one press report, some of the blame for Blanding's 1914 performance lay with the manager: > According to Frederick [Blanding], Birmingham used him badly last season. > When Fred was ready and anxious to pitch and warmed up with enough speed to > throw the ball through a brick wall, Birmingham wouldn't let him work. Other > days when he didn't even have a glove and had to borrow one, Joe sent him to > the mound and let him stay there until the humane society got an injunction. Although Blanding had previously been a supporter of Birmingham, Blanding wrote in December 1914 that he would not return to Cleveland in 1915 if Birmingham remained the manager. The Detroit Free Press reported: > The blond flinger ... does not threaten to leap to the Federals nor does he > demand more salary. He just says that he and Birmingham can't get along, and > that one of them will cease to be a Nap. As he has no authority to oust the > manager, he solves the perplexing problem by quitting himself. =Retirement from baseball= In February 1915, Blanding announced that he would not report for spring training. He said that he was quitting baseball because of \\"excessive weight.\\" He stated that he intended to remain at his farm in Birmingham, Michigan. Blanding noted that he believed he could \\"make just as much money and have a heap more of fun\\" devoting himself to agricultural pursuits on his farm. In five seasons with Cleveland, Blanding compiled a career record of 46-46 with a 3.13 ERA in 144 games, including 86 as a starter. He also compiled a respectable .258 batting average with one home run and 24 RBIs. During the summer of 1915, Blanding did return to baseball as a player for Detroit's Palestine Lodge team in the Masonic League. In a game against the Cleveland Masonic League champions on October 22, 1915, Blanding allowed only five hits against the Halcyon Lodge. The Detroit Free Press wrote that \\"Blanding was in splendid form, allowing five hits and fanning nine men.\\" Family and automotive business On 28 November 1914 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Blanding married Clara M. Shields of Cleveland.\\"Ohio, County Marriages, 1789-1994,\\" index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/X8KZ-489 : accessed 18 June 2012), Fred J. Blanding, 1914. After retiring from baseball, Blanding owned and operated the Ford Motor Company agency, sales office, and service facility for Lansing, Michigan, and adjacent territory. The business was originally a partnership with J. C. Clarkson, but Blanding purchased Clarkson's interest in the business in 1917.Registration card for Fred James Blanding, born February 8, 1888, at Redlands, California. In a draft registration card completed in June 1917, Blanding indicated that he was employed by an automobile dealer in Lansing. According to Rich Adler's history of baseball at the University of Michigan, Blanding's operation was one of the early Ford dealerships. In 1920, Blanding announced that, due to growth in the business, he would build a new facility at Lansing that would include a large garage and show room in a building with three stories and 5,400 square feet of floor space. In the early 1920s, Blanding also served as the president of the Lansing Senators, a baseball team that played in the Central League in 1921 and 1922. In May 1921, The Sporting News reported that Blanding \\"has announced on various and sundry occasions he intends leaving his auto sales-rooms and going out to the lot, where he is going to take off his coat and put the young pitchers of the Lansing team through a course of sprouts.\\" At the time of the 1920 and 1930 United States Censuses, Blanding was living in Lansing, Michigan, with his wife Clara, three children (George, Robert and Katherine) and a live-in maid or servant. His occupation was listed in 1920 as the manager of a garage and in 1930 as the president of a Ford and Lincoln distributorship.Census entry for Fred J. Blanding, age 31, born in California.

Land's End Road descends as an all-gravel road from the observatory down to U.S. Route 50, and the observatory can be accessed from that direction as well. The observatory was built by the United States Forest Service and the Works Progress Administration in 1936-37, with some assistance from two Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) side camps.

For image-processing techniques not related to the visually impaired, please create other articles such as Eulerian video magnification. thumb Video magnifiers are electronic devices that use a camera and a display screen to perform digital magnification of printed materials. The display screen is usually LCD or a similar flat-screen technology (although older video magnifiers have used CRT displays), and the device usually includes a lamp to illuminate the source material. Video magnifiers are designed to be mostly used by people with low vision that cannot be helped using a conventional magnifying glass. Advantages =Magnification range and display size= The main benefit of a video magnifier over purely optical magnification is that the video magnifier allows greater magnification across a larger field of view. With optical lenses, the field of meaningful, in-focus view is reduced with increased magnification. Thus, while a \\"full page magnifier\\" based on a fresnel lens can span some 625 cm2 (A4), it typically achieves no more than 1.4x magnification (advertised as \\"2x\\" if measured by area instead of the scale factor); an aspheric segment hand magnifier can achieve a scale factor in excess of 2 (area factor in excess of 4) but typically measures no more than 10 cm x 3 cm, and higher magnification factors require conventional lenses that focus on a very small area. A video magnifier however is limited only by its display size and its electronics; video magnifiers that can be switched between 2 and 50 times magnification are common, and displays can range from smartphone-sized to TV-sized. =Image processing= Most video magnifiers can automatically focus the image, and the more advanced models are capable of further electronic image processing to change the colours, enhance the contrast, and/or assist in the tracking of images. Some can be set to save \\"snapshots\\" of previously-seen images. Disadvantages =Power requirements= Video magnifiers require power, either via mains electricity or from a battery. This may make battery life an issue if the magnifier is required for an extended period of time away from power, whereas a purely optical magnification device could be used indefinitely without needing to be connected to power. =Non-portability of the larger models= Very large video magnifiers are not typically portable, but they can still be used in home installations, libraries and classrooms. Some of these models are informally referred to as CCTV magnifiers. =Pricing= As of 2013, video magnifiers are typically several times more expensive than optical-only magnifiers. Software video magnifiers Due to the high cost of dedicated- hardware video magnifiers, there has been some interest in software video magnification running on smartphones such as iPhone This review compares Super Vision+, See It Video Magnifier, Magnifier Magnifying Glass, BigMagnify, Magnifying Glass with Light Pro, and the built-in camera app. and Android,Android magnifier apps include Zoom Plus, Magnify It, Magnify, Magnifying Glass, Real Magnifier, Ideal Magnifier, etc, but it seems a comparative review of these Android apps has not yet been published. tablets such as iPad, and laptops with suitably-mounted camera peripherals. See also the download page for their software (in Chinese). See also Also Software magnifiers might not achieve the same quality as a good hardware video magnifier, and if used extensively they might exhaust the battery quickly, but if the user already has a smartphone, tablet or laptop then software magnification can be more economical than obtaining a separate hardware video magnifier.

The devices are placed around the pipe and integral fasteners are then tightened to clamp them onto the pipe. The friction between the pipe and riser clamp transfers the weight of the pipe through the riser clamp to the building structure. Risers are generally located at floor penetrations, particularly for continuous floor slabs such as concrete. They may also be located at some other interval as dictated by local building codes or at intermediate intervals to support plumbing which has been altered or repaired. Heavier piping types such as cast iron require more frequent support. Ordinarily, riser clamps are made of carbon steel and individually sized to fit certain pipe sizes. \\"Riser\\" refers to vertical runs of pipes, electrical conduit and tubes.

Constructed in 1938 for the Northern Territory Patrol Service, Kuru was requisitioned by the RAN following the Japanese declaration of war in December 1941. The ship operated from Darwin, and was one of the vessels used to keep Allied troops in Timor resupplied following the Japanese invasion. Kuru operated until 1943, when she was damaged beyond repair in an accident. Design and construction Kuru was built at Balmain, New South Wales in 1938 for the Northern Territory Patrol Service and was used to counter poaching by Japanese fishermen. She was long, had a maximum speed of , and was armed with a single three-pounder gun. In RAN service, her armament was increased to an Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, a 0.50 calibre M2 Browning machine gun, and several lighter machine guns.Gun Plot, HMAS Kuru Operational history Following the outbreak of the Pacific War, Kuru was commissioned into the RAN in December 1941 as an auxiliary patrol boat. HMAS Kuru played an important role in the Battle of Timor from May 1942 and completed numerous supply trips to the island. In late November 1942, the RAN was called on to evacuate the commandos of the 2/2nd Independent Company after ten months of guerilla warfare against the Japanese in Timor (an evacuation attempt in September had failed when the destroyer grounded, then was destroyed by Japanese aircraft), a contingent of Dutch troops, and over 100 Portuguese civilians, while delivering a relief contingent of Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and Australian soldiers.Feuer, Heroic stand of HMAS Armidale, p.50 Kuru and the Bathurst class corvettes and were assigned to the operation: on 30 November Kuru was to reach Betano Bay two hours before the other ships, offload her cargo, and take on the civilians, then meet the corvettes as they arrived and shuttle the fresh troops ashore, with personnel evacuated on return trips. Kuru sailed early on 29 November, and arrived without incident. After offloading the supplies and taking on 70 women and children, the vessel waited for Armidale and Castlemaine to arrive, but after they failed to appear by 02:00 the next morning, sailed for Darwin. The corvettes, which had been delayed by air attacks, found Kuru after dawn, and the civilians were transferred to Castlemaine, with Armidale and Kuru ordered to return by separate routes and attempt the operation again that night. During the day, Kuru was attacked by Japanese aircraft; despite the dropping of over 260 bombs, the vessel suffered only minor damage. At 20:00, the operation was called off as Japanese cruisers had been sighted in the area, and Kuru returned to Darwin on 3 December. Armidale was not so lucky; she was attacked and sunk by Japanese aircraft on 1 December. Following the evacuation of Timor, Kuru operated in Northern Australian waters and rescued the survivors of in January 1943. Kuru was damaged beyond repair by an accident in October 1943.

Biography Anna Gertrude Sanborn was a reporter for The Milwaukee Journal from 1915 to 1917. Her first two books were Blithesome Jottings: A Diary of Humorous Days (1918) and I, Citizen of Eternity: A Diary of Hopeful Days (1920). Each were published by the Four Seas Company, a Boston publishing house that released the works of many important modernist writers such as Gertrude Stein and William Faulkner. In I, Citizen of Eternity, Sanborn penned an optimistic riposte to Mary MacLane's 1917 memoir I, Mary MacLane. Sanborn's third novel, Toy (1922), is the coming-of-age story of Antoinette Ashworth, a wealthy socialite from Chicago. Sanborn attained significant notoriety for her novel Veiled Aristocrats (1923) which featured an interracial romance set partly in Chicago. Published by Carter G. Woodson's Associated Publishers, it dealt with race relations more directly than was fashionable at the time. The novel belonged to the genre of \\"passing\\" stories wherein light-complexioned African Americans passed for white. The novel's title was borrowed in 1932 by pioneer African American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux for his movie Veiled Aristocrats. It was a remake of his 1924 silent film House Behind the Cedars based on the novel by that name by Charles Chesnutt. Micheaux's Veiled Aristocrats also focused on \\"passing\\" and interracial relationships, but owed more to its source in Chesnutt than to Sanborn's novel. Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Sanborn was the daughter of Perley Roddis Sanborn (1854-1936) and Jane White Robbins (1849-1946). Her paternal grandfather was Dane County Judge Alden Sprague Sanborn. Anna Gertrude Sanborn is memorialized at Forest Home Cemetery.  Books  * Blithesome Jottings: A Diary of Humorous Days (1918).

H. Auden in Italy in May 1948. Central to his canon and one of Auden's finest poems, it has been the subject of diverse scholarly interpretations. Auden's limestone landscape has been interpreted as an allegory of Mediterranean civilization and of the human body. The poem, sui generis, is not easily classified. As a topographical poem, it describes a landscape and infuses it with meaning. It has been called the \\"first ‚Ä¶ postmodern pastoral\\". In a letter, Auden wrote of limestone and the poem's theme that \\"that rock creates the only human landscape.\\"Mendelson (1999), p. 290. First published in Horizon in July 1948, the poem then appeared in his important 1951 collection Nones. A revised version was published beginning in 1958, and is prominently placed in the last chronological section of Auden's Collected Shorter Poems, 1922‚Äì1957 (1966).  Themes  A view of Ischia, where Auden wrote \\"Limestone\\". Auden visited Ischia, an island in the Gulf of Naples, with Chester Kallman, in spring and summer 1948, and spent about six weeks on Ischia; \\"In Praise of Limestone\\" was the first poem he wrote in Italy. The titular limestone is characteristic of the Mediterranean landscape and is considered an allegory of history in the poem; the properties of this sedimentary rock invoke the sedentary and domestic picture of Mediterranean culture. The calcium in limestone makes it water-soluble and easily eroded, yet limestone builds up over eons, a stratum at a time, out of organic matter, recalling the stratified history of Mediterranean civilisation. Interpreting the metaphor of ground in poetry, the critic Rainer Emig writes, \\"The ground [is] a perfect symbol of cultural, ethnic, and national identity, a significatory confluence of the historical and the mythical, individual and collective.\\" According to critic Alan W. France, the Mediterranean's religious tradition and culture are contrasted in \\"Limestone\\" with the Protestant and rationalistic \\"Gothic North\\". He views the poem as an attempt to \\"rediscover the sacramental quality of nature, a quality still animate in the 'under-developed' regions of the Mediterranean South‚Äîin particular Italy below Rome, the Mezzogiorno‚Äîbut thoroughly extirpated in the Germanic North by Protestant asceticism and modern science.\\" Auden, then, is looking on this landscape from the outside, as a member of the Northern community, yet includes himself as one of the \\"inconstant ones\\": Rembrandt's Scholar in Meditation (1633) seeks an internal landscape. Other outsiders, however‚Äîthe constant and more single-minded (the \\"best and worst\\")‚Äîdo not share his appreciation for the landscape. Rather, they \\"never stayed here long but sought/ Immoderate soils where the beauty was not so external\\". The \\"granite wastes\\" attracted the ascetic \\"saints-to-be\\", the \\"clays and gravels\\" tempted the would-be tyrants (who \\"left, slamming the door\\", an allusion to Goebbels' taunt that if the Nazis failed, they would \\"slam the door\\" with a bang that would shake the universe), and an \\"older colder voice, the oceanic whisper\\" beckoned the \\"really reckless\\" romantic solitaries who renounce or deny life: The immoderate soils together represent the danger of humans \\"trying to be little gods on earth\\", while the limestone landscape promises that life's pleasures need not be incompatible with public responsibility and salvation. After seeming to dismiss the landscape as historically insignificant in these middle sections of the poem, Auden justifies it in theological terms at the end. In a world where \\"sins can be forgiven\\" and \\"bodies rise from the dead\\", the limestone landscape makes \\"a further point:/ The blessed will not care what angle they are regarded from/ Having nothing to hide.\\" The poem concludes by envisioning a realm like that of the Kingdom of God in physical, not idealistic terms: The limestone landscape rejects abstractions such as Platonic idealism‚Äîthe notion that substantive reality is only a reflection of a higher truth. Auden's literary executor and biographer Edward Mendelson and others interpret the poem as an allegory of the human body, whose characteristics correspond to those of the limestone landscape. The poet recognises that this landscape, like the body, is not witness to great historical events, but exists at a scale most suitable to humans. \\"Limestone\\" questions the valuation of that which exists on a scale different from the body‚Äîpolitics, the fascination with consciousness, and other abstractions.Smith (2004), pp. 56‚Äì57. In this interpretation the poem's ending lines justify the landscape in theological terms, and are also a theological statement of the body's sacred significance. The poem is thus an argument against Platonic and idealistic theologies in which the body is inherently fallen and inferior to the spirit. This interpretation is consistent with Auden's many prose statements about the theological importance of the body.Mendelson (1999). The Karst topography of Auden's birthplace, Yorkshire, also contains limestone. Some readings of the poem have thus taken Auden to be describing his own homeland. Auden makes a connection between the two locales in a letter written from Italy in 1948 to Elizabeth Mayer: \\"I hadn't realized how like Italy is to my 'Mutterland,' the Pennines\\". The maternal theme in the poem‚Äî ‚Äîis a point of entry into the psychoanalytical interpretation of the poem, in which the limestone landscape is a suitable backdrop for narcissism. The poem's \\"band of rivals\\" cavorting about the \\"steep stone gennels\\" exists in an aesthetic and spiritual torpor‚Äîunable to \\"conceive a god whose temper- tantrums are moral/ And not to be pacified by a clever line/ Or a good lay‚Ä¶\\". Lacking inner conflict, these youth will never \\"separate\\" or produce a new kind of art. Compared to the trait's earlier literary treatments, \\"Limestone\\"'s narcissism \\"bodes not so much the promise of a powerful aesthetic, but an artistic culture which, while it seduces, is ultimately stultified by the gratification of its own desire\\".  Structure and narration  The narrator's tone is informal and conversational, attempting to conjure the picture of a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment‚Äîonly 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore.Smith (2004), 57. The pattern is reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality. The poet's audience seems to change between halves of the poem. He first addresses, in the first-person plural, an audience of like-minded readers or perhaps humans in general. He is discursive and speaks from a historical perspective, using imperatives such as \\"mark these rounded slopes\\", \\"hear the springs\\", and \\"examine this region\\". At line 44, his listener becomes a single beloved person, and the tone becomes more private. Auden now refers to himself, specifically, and addresses an intimate as \\"dear\\", with a greater sense of urgency:  Legacy  Mendelson, Auden's biographer, summarises the response to \\"In Praise of Limestone\\" in the years following its publication: \\"Readers found the poem memorable ‚Ä¶ but even the critics who praised it did not pretend to understand it. Those who, without quite knowing why, felt grateful to it were perhaps responding to its secret, unexplicit defense of a part of themselves that almost everything else written in their century was teaching them to discredit or deny.\\"Mendelson (1999), p. 292. The English poet Stephen Spender (1909‚Äì1995) called \\"In Praise of Limestone\\" one of the century's greatest poems, describing it as \\"the perfect fusion between Auden's personality and the power of acute moral observation of a more generalized psychological situation, which is his great gift\\". Literary critic David Daiches found it loose and unfulfilling. The poem became \\"In Praise of Sandstone\\" at the hand of Australian poet John Tranter (1943‚Äì ), who created a poetic form called the \\"terminal\\" in which only the line-ending words of the source poem are kept in the writing of a new work.

It is essentially a television version of its sister operation, TMZ, a news website with a heavy emphasis on gossip of celebrities' personal lives, which debuted in December 2005. The television program is produced at studio facilities that serve as the headquarters for the parent website, located at 13031 West Jefferson Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. TMZ is an insider term (\\"thirty-mile zone\\" or studio zone), referring to the film studio area of downtown Hollywood. In November 2019, Fox Television Stations renewed TMZ on TV through the 2022‚Äì23 season. Format TMZ on TV is broadcast in two formats: the weekday edition is broadcast as a half-hour program; a one-hour weekend edition, composed of select stories featured in each of the weekday editions from the previous week, is also produced; during major holidays occurring on a weekday, that episode may feature a format similar to the weekend edition but featuring a compilation of stories from past editions centered around a particular theme (for example, a Christmas episode may center on celebrities who have been bad or good in the past year). Unlike most entertainment news programs, TMZ on TV does not use a format of anchors in a studio delivering the stories and correspondents reporting on many of the stories in each edition; instead, most story packages are delivered via an announcer, and \\"in-studio\\" segments are taped during a morning staff pitch meeting at TMZ's Jefferson Boulevard headquarters, with some TMZ staffers delivering story pieces themselves. The series delivers most of its stories in a humorous manner, mainly about certain celebrities, and features tongue-in-cheek jokes and double entendres, though more serious entertainment stories (such as a breaking entertainment story or celebrity death) ‚Äì which appear on the program sparingly ‚Äì often warrant a serious tone. Pieces often feature archived clips from television series and movies often for comedic effect, though they may sometimes be used to reference a project that an entertainer is known for performing in. Many pieces are shown in the \\"man on the street\\"-type question and answer format synonymous with paparazzi, though some celebrities do not answer certain questions asked to them by the videographer; a common recurring reference within the program is how certain TMZ videographers sometimes ask extremely trivial or bad questions to their subject. In lieu of regular daily segments such as a rumor mill segment, the program often shows recurring segments that appear over several episodes that feature a humorous or satirical introduction (for example, after the Tiger Woods adultery scandal broke in November 2009, all stories involving Woods began with the introduction: \\"TNN: The Tiger News Network\\", using a logo and name parodying that of Cable News Channel (CNN) ‚Äì a sister company to TMZ.com and the distributors of the television series, Warner Bros. Television and Telepictures, all owned by Time Warner); however for the first few weeks of the show's run, the series carried a daily segment called \\"Full Frontal Fashion\\", featuring celebrity fashion blunders, but it was dropped after roughly one month.

The series is set in the late 1870s and early 1880s, and also depicts other figures of the period, such as John Tunstall and Lew Wallace. Synopsis The real Pat Garrett The Tall Man stars 6'3\\" Barry Sullivan as Sheriff Pat Garrett, and Clu Gulager as Billy the Kid. Gulager was 32 in 1960, 11 years older than Billy the Kid was at the time of his death in 1881 at the age of 21. The highly fictionalized series provides a more humane image of the Kid than has history itself. In real life Garrett eventually shot Billy dead in a night-time ambush at a farmhouse in Fort Sumner, New Mexico, but no concluding episode depicting the grim conclusion was filmed. Set in and about Lincoln, New Mexico, the series opens with a view of the extremely long shadow cast by Sullivan on a western street, hence the name \\"the tall man\\". In the premiere episode, \\"Garrett and the Kid\\" (September 10, 1960), Garrett arrives in Lincoln, depicted in the series as a gold-mining boomtown, as the new deputy sheriff, only to learn that a crooked saloon owner, Paul Mason (Robert Middleton), dominates the community, including the marshal, Dave Leggert (Denver Pyle). When he sees his power threatened, Mason tries to hire Billy to kill Garrett, unaware that the two were then on friendly terms. Vaughn Taylor is cast in this episode as Judge Riley, and King Donovan appears as a Mason henchman. Marianna Hill was cast in several episodes as one of Billy's girlfriends, Rita.

In \\"The Reversed Blade\\" (N¬∫ 21), Murray Matheson portrays Billy's employer, John Tundall, though the name of the historical person is John Tunstall. Tundall grows indignant when the con-man Ben Webster (John Archer), who stole his wife and $10,000 eight years earlier, arrives in Lincoln. Jeanne Cooper plays Tundall's former wife, now Mrs. Elmira Webster. John Tunstall died at twenty-four, but Matheson was forty-nine when he assumed the role as Billy's employer.

In \\"Shadow of the Past\\" (N¬∫ 42), Charles Aidman is cast as Ben Wiley, the father of Billy's newest girlfriend, Sue Wiley (Barbara Parkins). Sheriff Garrett recognizes Wiley as an informant who stopped Garrett from escaping from a Confederate prison during the American Civil War. Nancy Davis Reagan appears in this episode as Ben's wife, Sarah. In \\"The Girl from Paradise\\" (N¬∫ 56), Billy is framed for murder by his old nemesis, Rafe Tollinger (Kelly Thordsen), the sheriff of a neighboring county. He is sent to the gallows along with Anne Drake (Pippa Scott), a pretty young woman who is also framed for murder. The two are handcuffed together but manage to escape and then must flee from an approaching posse. In \\"St. Louis Woman\\" (N¬∫ 57), Jan Clayton, formerly of CBS's Lassie, portrays Janet Harper, a widow engaged to marry Tom Davis (Russ Conway), a longtime friend of Sheriff Garrett.

While mentally unbalanced from his illness, Stewart plots his own suicide and plans to frame his wife, Isobel (Lori March), for murder. In \\"The Runaway Groom\\" (N¬∫ 71), the Tugwell Brothers seek the husband of their sister, Sally (Roberta Shore), who deserted his wife right after the marriage a year earlier. They believe Billy the Kid is the missing husband and father of Sally's baby, rather than Charlie Fox (Gary Vinson). Ed Nelson, prior to Peyton Place, was cast as a talented but arrogant young physician, Wade Parsons, in the 1962 episode \\"Doctor on Horseback\\" (N¬∫ 74). Dr. Parsons, who has assumed the practice of a beloved doctor who retired, must attempt to save the life of a young pregnant woman after she attempts suicide when her husband deserts her. In the series finale, \\"Phoebe\\" (N¬∫ 75), George Macready portrays Cyrus Canfield, a vengeful father searching for his runaway teenaged daughter, played by Floy Dean. When Canfield sees Billy with a necklace owned by Phoebe, he suspects that the young gunfighter may have killed his daughter. Billy, however, explains that Phoebe gave him the necklace as a gift after he rescued her in a rockslide.

Brown graduated from Swarthmore College then attended Johns Hopkins Medical School. He did his medical residency at the hospital associated with the Rockefeller Institute.At Rockefeller he did research on synovial fluid from people with RA and in 1937 found Mycoplasma in the fluid from some patients, leading him to believe that RA might be an infectious disease. His work was interrupted by service in World War II; after the war he obtained a position at George Washington University and began to experimentally treat some people with RA with antibiotics, which at the time were a new class of drugs. Some of the people he treated were members of Congress or ambassadors, and some of them responded positively. He presented his work at a conference in 1949; at the same conference, the new drug cortisone was presented, and it overshadowed his work and became the leading treatment for RA. Throughout his career, Brown fought to have his antibiotic treatments recognized by the medical establishment; they were not.

He played Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Phillies from 1929 to 1932. He led the National League by appearing in 48 games as a pitcher in 1930. Over his four-year major league career, he compiled an 11-24 record with a 6.95 earned run average (ERA). Elliot has the dubious distinction of having the highest career ERA among all major league pitchers with at least 300 innings pitched since baseball's modern era began in 1900. Early life Elliott was born in Mt. Clemens, Michigan in 1899. His father, John W. Elliott, was born in Canada, and his mother, Anna Elliott, was born in Germany. At the time of the 1900 United States Census, Elliott and his parents were living in Mt. Clemens, and his father was employed as a day laborer.Census entry for John Elliott and family.

Elliott served in the United States Army Air Service during World War I as a private in the 66th Balloon Company. After the war, he attended the University of Michigan and played college baseball for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team from 1921-22. The 1923 Michiganensian noted: \\"Elliott was easily the sophomore find of the pitching staff. His absence next year will be deeply felt.\\"1923 Michiganensian, page 238. Professional baseball =Minor leagues= After leaving Michigan, he played professional baseball for 15 years, from 1923 to 1937. He began his career with the Kalamazoo Celery Pickers in the Michigan-Ontario League in 1923 and 1924. In 1925, he played for the London Indians in the same league. He next played for three years for the Waco Cubs in the Texas League from 1926 to 1928. He appeared in 113 games for Waco from 1927 to 1928 and compiled a record of 48-51. He had his best year in 1928 with a 16-13 record and 3.76 ERA. =Philadelphia Phillies= After a solid season with Waco in 1928, Elliott was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals and then sold to the Philadelphia Phillies. On April 2, 1929, shortly after reporting to the Phillies' training camp in Florida, Eliott was injured when a car driven by Phillies' shortstop Tommy Thevenow crashed and both men were ejected from the vehicle. Elliott had ten stitches in his face and was discharged from the hospital; Thevenow remained hospitalized in critical condition. Eliott made his major league debut with the Phillies on April 19, 1929. He played four years with the Phillies from 1929 to 1932. He led the National League in games played by a pitcher in 1930, appearing in 48 games, including 11 as a starter. The Phillies finished in last place in the National League in 1930 with a 52-102 record. His ERA jumped to 9.55 in 16 games for the Phillies in 1931. In his four seasons with the Phillies, Elliott had a record of 11‚Äì24, appeared in 120 games (30 as a starter), pitched 322-1/3 innings, and had a career ERA of 6.56. =Return to minor leagues= Elliott appeared in his last major league game in 1933. However, he continued to play minor league baseball through the 1937 season. His minor league assignments included the Buffalo Bisons (34 games in 1933), Syracuse Chiefs and Buffalo Bisons (30 games in 1934), Harrisburg Senators (35 games in 1935), Wilkes-Barre Barons (60 games from 1936-1937). Family and later years Elliott was married to Gwedonlyn Tressa Brom in September 1922. He moved to Honolulu, Hawaii in the late 1950s. In April 1963, he died at his home in Honolulu at age 63.

In the past, school captains were almost always appointed by the administration of the school, but there has been an increasing tendency for them to be chosen by the student body.

The towers and walls of the fortress were decorated with many bas-reliefs of a dragon, seizing the heads of a bull or an eagle or holding a lamb in its talons and a tiger in movement. The architectural design of the ‚ÄúKars‚Äù and ‚ÄúDvin‚Äù gates give the ‚ÄúSmbat‚Äù walls a monumental aspect. These massive gates, found by archaeologists during excavations, were covered in thick iron plates and were held shut by beams, encircled with hoops at the end. Having completed his construction work on the fortress, king of Armenia Smbat went on to build a number of beautiful buildings and a marvellous palace complex on the acropolis. The palace, which stood on the top of a hill, was surrounded by a separate system of fortress walls and was the principal residence of the Bagratids. The king's official rooms and the residential part of the palace were divided off from one another by a wide corridor and the whole palace took up one sixth of the acropolis (4,900 square metres) and consisted of many rooms. In the North-Western corner of the palace there was a reception room (21 metres x 10.5 metres), which was faced with smoothly hewn stone and decorated with a multi-faceted carved colonnade. In the next room, figures of animals, framed with plants were moulded in plaster. In a third room, which was built in the form of a basilica, the walls were decorated with military scenes and covered in gold leaf; the arched wooden ceiling was decorated with carvings.

A planetary flyby is the act of sending a space probe past a planet or a dwarf planet close enough to record scientific data. This is a subset of the overall concept of a flyby in spaceflight. The first flyby of another planet with a functioning spacecraft took place on December 14, 1962, when Mariner 2 zoomed by the planet Venus. Planetary flybys are commonly used as gravity assist maneuvers to \\"slingshot\\" a space probe toward its primary target without expending fuel, but in some cases (such as with New Horizons), flybys are the primary objectives of a mission in of themselves. A relatively recent example of a flyby spacecraft is New Horizons, which performed flyby maneuvers of Jupiter, Pluto and its moons in the 21st century. The flyby of Jupiter, used as a gravity assist, allowed the craft to reach Pluto at high velocity without the complications of slowing down, after which it proceeded further into the Kuiper Belt on an escape trajectory out of the Solar System.

On July 31, 1997, the aircraft flying this route crashed during landing on its final segment at Newark International Airport (EWR), catching fire as it flipped upside down, injuring all five people on board. Summary Flight 14 crashed while landing on runway 22R at Newark Airport on July 31, 1997. The flight originated in Singapore with intermediate stops in Penang, Malaysia, followed by Taipei, Taiwan, and then Anchorage, Alaska. In addition to the Captain and First Officer there were three passengers on board, including one riding in the jump seat. During the flight, the pilots were concerned that they would have little stopping distance after landing, and the captain said that he wanted to put the aircraft down early on the runway. The aircraft had departed with one thrust reverser (on the left engine) inoperative, and the pilots knew of incidents in the aircraft's maintenance log where the auto-brakes had failed to activate during landings. They had also misinterpreted the runway data, and so believed they had less stopping distance than was actually available. The landing was normal until the beginning of the flare phase. The MD-11 touched down, bounced, and rolled to the right. On the second touchdown, about 1,100 feet later, the right gear snapped and the No. 3 engine (right wing engine) contacted the runway, with the right roll continuing until the right wing spars broke. The aircraft came to rest off the right side of the runway, on its back, and on fire. All five occupants escaped through a cockpit window. The airplane was destroyed by fire. Aircraft and crew The aircraft, named Joshua by FedEx, construction number 48603 and line number 553, was a McDonnell Douglas MD-11F freight model, powered by three General Electric CF6-80C2D1F engines. Registered in the United States as the aircraft was delivered new to FedEx in September 1993. Prior to the crash, the aircraft had a total of 13,034 flight hours and 2,950 flight cycles (a flight cycle is defined as a takeoff and landing), and had been involved in two prior incidents. In January 1994, when it sustained underbelly damage during a bounced landing at Memphis International Airport. Then in November 1994, the aircraft was involved in a tailstrike at Anchorage International Airport. Permanent repairs were made from the Anchorage incident within days of the tailstrike, and permanent repairs to the Memphis incident were made at the next C check in August 1995. The captain was 46-year-old Robert M. Freeman who joined FedEx in 1988 when it bought Flying Tiger Line, which he had previously worked for. Freeman had logged a total of 11,000 flight hours, including 1,253 hours on the MD-11. The first officer was 39-year-old Donald E. Goodin, who had been with FedEx since 1994, having served as a former U.S. Air Force pilot and had 3,703 flight hours, though only 592 of them were with FedEx. Goodin only had 92 hours on the MD-11. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) conducted a full investigation of the accident and concluded that the probable cause was the captain's over-control of the aircraft during the landing and his failure to go around after a destabilized flare. Beginning about 17 feet above the runway, the captain had let the nose lower, probably to achieve an earlier touchdown, then raised it and increased thrust to slow the plane's descent, then pushed the nose down again (around the time of the first touchdown) to try to keep the plane on the runway. These last control inputs were \\"too late and too large\\" to stabilize the landing, and the plane's high sink rate and rightward roll compressed the right landing gear strut at the second touchdown, which broke the right wing rear spar and ruptured the right fuel tank. NTSB safety recommendations As a result of its investigation of this accident, the NTSB made new recommendations based on their findings and conclusions to improve the safety of operations of the MD-11 type aircraft including that the FAA develop new pilot training tools to \\"include information about factors that can contribute to structural failures involving the landing gear, wings, and fuselage, such as design sink rate limits; roll angle limits; control inputs' roll rate; pitch rate; single-gear landings; the effect of decreased lift; and structural loading consequences of bottoming landing gear struts and tires; provide a syllabus for simulator training on the execution of stabilized approaches to the landing flare, the identification of unstabilized landing flares, and recovery from these situations, including proper high sink rate recovery techniques during flare to landing, techniques for avoiding and recovering from overcontrol in pitch before touchdown, and techniques for avoiding overcontrol and premature derotation during a bounced landing; and to promote an orientation toward a proactive go-around.\\"  Aftermath  For his role in the accident, FedEx fired Captain Freeman on October 30, 2000. However, the FedEx pilot union criticized the decision and announced that they would appeal it, citing that the crash was caused by aircraft design flaws.  Flight number  FedEx Express continues to use Flight 14 as an active flight number today; the route has been modified to originate in Hong Kong, with the stop of Taipei before continuing on to Anchorage and Memphis as destination.  Media  The crashes of FedEx Express Flight 14, and a similar crash in 2009 of another McDonnell Douglas MD-11, FedEx Express Flight 80 at Narita International Airport in Japan, are both covered on Season 14 of Mayday (Air Crash Investigation), episode 5, titled The Final Push.

It joins Elm Street (New Hampshire Route 135) in South Lancaster with River Road (Town Highway 1) in Lunenburg. Built in 1911, it is one of two Howe truss bridges across the Connecticut River. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Mount Orne Covered Bridge is located in a rural area of eastern Lunenburg and southwestern Lancaster. It spans the Connecticut River in a roughly northwest-southeast orientation. It consists of two spans of wood-and-iron Howe trusses, resting on stone abutments and piers which have been partially faced in concrete. The overall length of the bridge is , with the western span measuring and the eastern span one foot less. The bridge has an overall width of , with a roadway of . The bridge is covered by a corrugated metal gable roof, and is sided in vertical boarding that extends only partway to the eaves. The siding extends around to the insides of the portals. The bridge was built in 1911 by the Berlin Construction Company, replacing one that was washed away by flooding in 1905. It is one of only two Howe truss bridges over the Connecticut River; the other, the Columbia Bridge, was built in 1912. The two bridges are among the last to be built during the historic period of covered bridge construction in either state. The costs of construction and maintenance are shared by the two towns. The most recent rededication of the bridge took place on November 23, 1983.

The leaves are simple, and are petiolate (on short stalks), except in O. sessilifolia, with entire or occasionally sinuate (wavy) edges. The inflorescences are loose thyrses of flowers, growing from leaf axils (axillary) or directly from the stem (cauliflory). The flowers are large, conspicuous and bisexual; the calyx is actinomorphic (rotationally symmetrical), but the corolla is zygomorphic, sometimes strongly so. Although some species have four stamens in each flower, they are usually reduced in number with two stamens, usually the posterior pair, forming staminodes instead. Distribution Twenty of the twenty-one species are found on the island of Grande Terre (the main island of New Caledonia). Three species occur on the adjacent island of √éle des Pins, two on Lifou and one on Mar√© in the Loyalty Islands, and two on Vanuatu (including one introduced species). Oxera vanuatuensis is only known from Vanuatu, where it is only known from cultivated specimens. Villagers on Pentecost Island (and their descendants on Maewo call the tree harongmau, and propagate the species by planting seeds, transplanting seedlings or taking cuttings. The plant is thought to treat illnesses caused by black magic, and profuse flowering from the trunk is thought to foretell a good harvest of yams. Species Twenty-one species are recognised in the genus Oxera, in five informal species groups: ;baladica group *Oxera baladica Vieill. *Oxera sessilifolia Dubard *Oxera subverticillata Vieill. *Oxera vanuatuensis de Kok ‚Äì Vanuatu ;robusta group *Oxera coriacea Dubard *Oxera coronata de Kok *Oxera palmatinervia Dubard *Oxera robusta Vieill. ;pulchella group *Oxera balansae Dubard ‚Äì Grande Terre, √éle des Pins, Lifou EN *Oxera brevicalyx (Moldenke) de Kok *Oxera crassifolia Virot LC *Oxera morierei Vieill. *Oxera pulchella Labill.

Beauvis. *Oxera macrocalyx Dubard VU *Oxera oreophila Guillaumin Taxonomic history The genus Oxera was erected by Jacques Labillardi√®re in 1824, based on a single specimen that he had collected in New Caledonia. The closest relative of Oxera is the genus Faradaya, and the two genera were once united as the tribe Oxereae. Collectively, they are the sister group to a clade containing Clerodendrum and a number of segregate genera such as Kalaharia, Huxleya, Amasonia and Tetraclea. Both genera are now treated as members of the subfamily Teucrioideae, following work published by Philip D. Cantino in 1992.

The album is a re-release of the band's Christmas EP, Deck the Halls, Bruise Your Hand, but with seven new songs and some other changes, such as track listing and a new ending to one song. The details were announced by Jesus Freak Hideout on August 21, 2007, and by IGN around the same time. The album peaked at No. 96 on the Billboard 200 list in its fourth week. \\"Silver Bells\\" was posted on the group's Myspace account on November 7, 2008. A re-issue of the album was released on iTunes on November 18, 2008. It included Relient K's renditions of \\"Silver Bells\\", \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\", and \\"O Holy Night\\", as well as a music video for the band's version of \\"Sleigh Ride\\". The songs were eventually pulled from iTunes, but have since then been added to Gotee's 2010 Christmas compilation CD: 'Tis The Season To Be Gotee. =Music video= The band's video for \\"Sleigh Ride\\" was made by Funny Pages Productions. It is an animated video, and the band had mentioned in recent years that they always wanted to do an animated video. It features all of the band members as rabbits in winter. The Matt Thiessen rabbit fails to get the attention of a girl rabbit, which leads the other four band members to steal Santa's sleigh so that he can impress her. After the two take off in the sleigh, Santa tries to get it back by using a giant snowman. After some close calls, the other band members build a snowwoman to draw the snowman off. In the end, they give Santa his sleigh back, and the Ethan Luck rabbit sneaks a present from Santa's sleigh for Matt to give to the girl rabbit. The video was released in November 2008.

It evolved from the Pampango term Palakpalak, a name used in reference to malakmalak. Malakmalak is a tree reaching a height of about 25 meters and a diameter of about 80 centimeters. The leaves are usually 16 centimeters or more in length. The lower surfaces are about 1.5. centimeters in length, and are borne on long stalks in small clusters. The corolla is white, the calyx brown and velvety. this species is very common and widely distributed in primary forests at low and medium altitudes from northern Luzon to southern Mindanao. It is cultivated at the Lamao Experimental Station. The fruit of this species is oval, similar to chico in appearance, about 3 to 4 centimeters or more in length, with an edible pulp of good flavor, and contains a single seed. Blanco mentioned that the seeds yield limpid, odorous oil which is employed in food as an illuminant. It is also called Palaquium oleiferum Blanco, a species apparently confined to the Philippines.

It contains about 200 species, which range from shrubs to small trees, and is distributed throughout the New World tropics.Taylor (2008) These plants are very closely related to Psychotria and in particular its subgenus Heteropsychotria. Indeed, it seems to be nothing else but a distinctively-flowered offshoot of Heteropsychotria; arguably, it would thus need to be merged into Psychotria to make that genus monophyletic. On the other hand, Psychotria is extremely diverse already, so it is probably more practical to move the more distantly related species out of this genus and merge Heteropsychotria with Palicourea. By a Hungarian botanist Attila Borhidi, some of the Psychotria species have been transferred into this genus.Govaerts, R., Ruhsam, M., Andersson, L., Robbrecht, E., Bridson, D., Davis, A., Schanzer, I., Sonk√©, B. (2019). World Checklist of Rubiaceae. Facilitated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Published on the Internet; https://wcsp.science.kew.org/ Retrieved 25 June 2019 The genus is not well studied. Most species are distylous, although a few on isolated Caribbean islands seem to have lost the trait. Flowers are in racemes, having no scent, and are normally pollinated by hummingbirds. Blue-black berries follow, and are thought to be distributed by birds. Almost one-tenth of the Palicourea species are considered threatened by the IUCN, even though the conservation status has only been reviewed for those species that occur in Ecuador.IUCN (2008) Selected species * Palicourea anderssoniana * Palicourea anianguana * Palicourea asplundii * Palicourea azurea * Palicourea calantha * Palicourea calothyrsus * Palicourea calycina * Palicourea canarina * Palicourea candida * Palicourea consobrina * Palicourea corniculata * Palicourea cornigera * Palicourea elata (syn.

These stones bear the monogram of several of the founding families. The Congregation was founded by Dutch Settlers in 1686. For the first ten years the congregation worshipped in various locations, and in 1696 the first building was built on the current site. In 1780 Colonial General Enoch Poor was buried in the Cemetery.

Bronnen's most famous play is the Expressionist drama Parricide (Vatermord, 1922); its premi√®re production is notable, among other things, for being that from which Bronnen's friend, the young Bertolt Brecht in an early stage of his directing career, withdrew, after being taken to hospital with malnutrition and the actors of the cast, led by Heinrich George, walked out on him.Willett and Manheim (1970, viii) and Thomson (1994, 26). According to The Cambridge Guide to Theatre, the \\"erotic, anti-bourgeois, black expressionism\\" of the play \\"caused a sensation\\" when it was eventually performed. Bronnen also wrote Birth of Youth (Geburt der Jugend, 1922) and Die Excesse (1923).Banham (1998, 132). After having collaborated on film treatments and various theatrical projects together, in 1923 Bronnen and Brecht co-directed a condensed version of Pastor Ephraim Magnus (a nihilistic, Expressionist play, according to The Cambridge Guide, \\"stuffed with perversities and sado-masochistic motifs\\") by Hans Henny Jahnn.Banham (1998, 553), Sacks (1994, xviii), and Willett and Manheim (1970, viii).

Election Drouin was elected as the council member for H√©rouxville's Electoral District No. 6 in 2005. Code of Conduct He was largely unknown beyond the Mauricie region of the province of Quebec until he authored a 'code of conduct' that spells out standards for newcomers to his community. The controversial document drew media attention because of its perceived eccentricity and alleged lack of inclusiveness toward certain minorities. It contradicts a number of Supreme Court rulings and notably forbids a resident to: * Kill women by stoning them in public * Burn women alive or with acid * Allow Sikh children to carry kirpans Despite its flaws, Drouin's code raised questions on the limits of tolerance and fueled the debate over reasonable accommodations. Tout le monde en parle In February 2007, Drouin went on the set of the French Canadian talk-show Tout le monde en parle to expose his views. While on the show, he claimed that he had no intention to succeed H√©rouxville Mayor Martin P√©rigny. Host Guy A.

With an elevation of above sea level, the mountain can be seen from the nearby Jenolan-Oberon Road. The 'summit' or the area generally known as Mount Trickett is topped by a high tower, and stands over above Jenolan Caves in the valley below. The tower location (around and called \\"The Porcupine\\") is not actually Mount Trickett or the highest point. The true location of Mount Trickett is approximately further west along Edith Road. Features Snowfalls are relatively common on Mount Trickett from autumn through to spring with perhaps ten to fifteen falls per season. Five or six of these snowfalls are typically heavy enough to close the roads near the summit. Icy roads during the colder months can also make travel in the area hazardous although it is usually navigable by 2WD vehicles. Particularly strong cold outbreaks make an approach from the Jenolan Caves side quite risky and the Oberon road is preferred. There is a nondescript gravel turnoff that leads you to a brick building at the summit with a sign that says \\"Navigational Facility\\". As with nearby Mount Bindo and Shooters Hill, this is a common spot for 'snow chasers' to look for snow when coming in from Sydney and the Blue Mountains. There are no survey control marks (including trigonometrical stations) located at the summit of Mount Trickett. Etymology Mount Trickett may well have been named after Oliver Trickett L.S. M.S., as he was the Licensed Surveryor, mapper and modeller of the Jenolan Caves over twenty years in the late 1800s to early 1900s, (along with surveying and mapping most other major limestone caves in NSW, and surveying, mapping and modelling the mining loads of NSW, chief being the Broken Hill silver, lead and zinc load). This work was conducted whilst in the employ as Surveyor for the NSW Department of Lands and Mining Surveyor for the NSW Department of Mines. He became the chief superintendent of Jenolan Caves in terms of overseeing all access improvements at Jenolan in the early 1900s.

It is not to be confused with similar plants in the same genus which are also often referred to as \\"yellow woodsorrel\\".  Growth  Commonly considered a weed of gardens, fields, and lawns, it grows in full sun or shade. The alternate leaves of this plant are divided into three heart-shaped leaflets (a typical trait of other species of Oxalis) that can grow up to 2 cm wide. These leaves curl up at night (exhibiting nyctinasty), and open in the day to perform photosynthesis. The mature seed capsules open explosively when disturbed (a very similar trait to that of the mature seed capsules or fruits of plants found in the genus Impatiens) and can disperse seeds up to 4 meters (about 13 feet) away. The flowers of the plant are hermaphroditic, blooming from July to October. O. stricta generally requires dry or moist, alkaline soils, preferring sandy and loamy dirt to grow in. It requires well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor grounds. It does not do well in shade. Cultivation =Culinary uses= A diagram showing various parts of young O. stricta plants All parts of the plant are edible, with a distinct tangy flavor (common to all plants in the genus Oxalis). However, it should only be eaten in small quantities, since oxalic acid is an antinutrient and can inhibit the body's absorption supply of calcium. Oxalis stricta, showing seed pods. The leaves and flowers of the plant are sometimes added to salads for decoration and flavoring. These can also be chewed raw (along with other parts of the plant, but not the root) as a thirst-quencher. The green pods are pleasant raw, having a juicy crisp texture and a tartness similar to rhubarb in flavor. The leaves can be used to make a flavored drink that is similar in taste to lemonade, and the whole plant can be brewed as herbal tea that has an aroma somewhat like that of cooked green beans. The juices of the plant have been extracted from its greens as a substitute to common vinegar. Oxalis stricta contains large amounts of vitamin C. =Practical uses= An orange dye can be obtained by boiling the whole plant. =Medicinal uses= A poultice of the plant has been used to treat swellings.

It was Nikon's first full-frame DSLR. The D3, along with the Nikon D3X, was a flagship model in Nikon's line of DSLRs, superseding the D2Hs and D2Xs. It was replaced by the D3S as Nikon's flagship DSLR. The D3, D3X, D3S, D4, D5, D6, D700, D800, D800–ï and Df are the only Nikon FX format DSLRs manufactured in Japan. The D3S was replaced by the D4 in 2012.  Technology  Nikon D3 The D3 features a full- frame 35 mm equivalent CMOS image sensor measuring 23.9 mm √ó 36.0 mm. This sensor is larger than the DX format sensors of all previous Nikon DSLRs, and Nikon has coined the term \\"FX format\\" to describe it. The D3's sensor has larger pixels and greater light sensitivity than previous DX sensors. This allows the camera to reach higher equivalent film speeds and produce images with less noise in low light situations. Low light situations include times when the camera is operated at high shutter speed or high f number, where the lens' aperture is reduced to improve depth of field and sharpness. The sensor captures image data at 14 bits per color channel through 12-channel parallel readout, which ensures 9 frame/s continuous shooting with higher bit depth than that on previous 12-bit sensors. Processed with the new Nikon EXPEED engine, the Live View mode in D3, along with D300, was Nikon's first implementation in its DSLR line-up. D3 also uses a stepper motor in aperture coupling mechanism for the first time,Nikon D-Technology, D3 Series Aperture Coupling. allowing real time depth of field control in Live View with exposure preview and live histogram functions. Additionally, D3 provides a lossless algorithm applied to RAW file along with uncompressed and lossy-compressed format. The camera grip and body style were designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign. The camera body uses the Nikon F mount, making it compatible with older Nikon lenses. Other features include 9 frames per second in FX and 11 frames in DX and a large and bright LCD screen. Three firmware updates have been released for the D3. The latest firmware version is 2.02. In this firmware version, the maximum ISO sensitivity allowed under Automatic ISO can be modified in increments the same as the manual ISO settings can, and automatic White balance and focus tracking are improved. In the 2.01 firmware update, automatic correction of lateral chromatic aberration is standardized, and Vignetting (\\"Vignette control\\"), lens distortion (\\"Distortion\\") correction, as well as image rotation (\\"Straighten\\") via playback (\\"Retouch\\") menu, are made possible. The Nikon D3 has a hardware interface for direct geotagging with Nikon GP-1 GPS. Audience The D3 is Nikon's first full frame DSLR. Full frame can either offer greater resolution or larger pixels for improved sensitivity; in the D3 Nikon opted for a lower resolution, higher sensitivity solution. For additional resolution, the D3x was introduced. Full frame sensors also maintain the traditional focal lengths and depth of field associated with 35mm camera systems. Because it is Nikon's first such camera, it does not succeed or replace another camera model. Other professional-grade Nikon models included the D2Xs and D2Hs. The camera has a vertical grip in addition to the standard horizontal grip. When Nikon announced the D3, it was priced at US$4999, but present prices are much lower.Google product search: Nikon D3 In July 2008 the D3x's larger buffer memory was offered as an upgrade to D3 owners, doubling its continuous shooting capacity. This modification represents approximately 10% of the original cost of the camera. New D3 bodies still ship with the original buffer memory; upgraded models can be identified with a \\"2x\\" label in the storage card door. As many other Nikon film SLR (various modified Nikon F, F3, F4, F5) and digital DSLR cameras like the Nikon NASA F4, Nikon based Kodak DCS 460, DCS 660 and DCS 760, Nikon D1, D2X and D2Xs, the D3 is used by NASA, for example in Space Shuttle missions to the International Space Station. Reception Popular Photography magazine determined that the Nikon D3 camera has excellent control of noise and can shoot in very low light at high ISO speeds with very usable results. The DxOMark Sensor rankings issued by DxO Labs placed the Nikon D3 at fourth place behind two medium-format cameras from Phase One and the subsequent Nikon D3X. The Nikon D3 was also tested by many independent reviewers. Nikon D3X The D3X is a higher resolution version of the D3 which was announced in December 2008. It features a 24.5 megapixel sensor, an ISO range of 50‚Äì6400, and a new image processing system. Nikon D3s The D3S was announced in October 2009. It features a redesigned 12.1 megapixel sensor, raises the maximum ISO up to 102,400 (equivalent), image sensor cleaning and adds a 720p video mode.

His first major job in special effects makeup was on the George A. Romero film Day of the Dead (1985), under the tutelage of Romero and make-up effects veteran Tom Savini. In 1988, along with Robert Kurtzman and Howard Berger, he formed KNB EFX Group, a special make-up effects studio which has gone on to work on over 400 film and television projects. KNB has won numerous awards, including an Emmy Award in 2001 for their work on the 2000 Sci Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and an Academy Award in 2006 for achievement in makeup for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. He is currently working as an executive producer, special make-up effects supervisor, and primary director on the AMC TV series The Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead. Nicotero has directed 31 episodes of The Walking Dead and is the creator of the webseries The Walking Dead: Webisodes. Life and career Nicotero in October 2012. Nicotero claims he began taking an interest in special effects after viewing the film Jaws. He explains: \\"I kept thinking 'How the hell did they do that?! How'd they build a big giant shark that could eat people?!' So, between that movie, The Exorcist, Planet of the Apes, and of course all of the Universal horror movies [...] I think Jaws and then later Dawn of the Dead were pretty much the two movies that did it for me.\\" Nicotero began his career working in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, learning the trade of special make-up effects, also known as prosthetic makeup, from Tom Savini, an award-winning special effects and makeup artist, and helping on films by director George A. Romero. While working on the 1985 Romero film Day of the Dead, he met Howard Berger, who would become one of his partners at KNB EFX Group. Nicotero relocated to Hollywood and moved in with Berger and Robert Kurtzman. He later worked as FX artist on the 2010 film Predators and created a classic predator figure for the film. Nicotero worked as special make-up effects supervisor, co-executive producer and occasional director for the TV series The Walking Dead, as well as acting in a few uncredited cameos. He was at the San Diego Comic-Con International for the show. He was a guest on Talking Dead on March 24, 2013,Season 3, Episode 15 Talking Dead October 12, 2014, February 8, 2015, and February 14, 2016.

It is endemic to Palawan in the Philippines. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.  Etymology  This orchid was named after Dr. Jack Fowlie, who was an editor of Orchid Digest. Interestingly, this is not the only species named after Fowlie: the Paphiopedilum jackii was also named after him.  Description  The orchid is herbaceous with blue-gray leaves that are tessellated with faint patterns. The plant can attain a height of 20 centimeters, and leaves are from 10 to 14 centimeters long and 2.5 to 3.5 centimeters wide. Upper surfaces of leaves have patterns reminiscent of a fuzzy chessboard, while the bottom surfaces are uniformly light green. During bloom, an approximately 25 cm long inflorescence with a single flower emerges. Petals with veins of green and purple have black warts covering their edges and they curved in an s-shape. While the plant has been reported to flower at various times throughout the year, it generally flowers between January and April. The length of each generation is about 7 or 8 years.  Distribution and habitat  Paphiopedilum fowliei is found in the Philippine Islands in the forests of the southeast side of Palawan Island. This is the only known location of this plant. The plant often grows on leaf mould or detritus on limestone rocks. While it often grows in bright light, the plant does not usually grow in direct sunlight, but will grow well under fluorescent lights. It usually grows at an elevation from 600 to 950 meters, and has a mean temperature range of 23 to 24 degrees Celsius. The plant prefers high humidity with sufficient air circulation.  Conservation  Paphiopedilum fowliei is identified as critically endangered and only exists in one location. The entirety of the island on which it resides, Palawan island, is a declared protected area.

It replaced the D200 as Nikon's DX format flagship DSLR. The D300 was discontinued by Nikon on September 11, 2009, being replaced by the modified Nikon D300S, which was released July 30, 2009. The D300S remained the premier Nikon DX camera until the D7100 was released in early 2013. Features The D300 was designated by Nikon as the ultimate in DX format performance. It is quite similar to the D700, with the main difference being that the D300 uses a DX sensor instead of an FX sensor. It offers both high resolution and high speed (being able to capture 6 frames per second, and 8 frames per second with the addition of an optional MB-D10 battery pack). The D300 has not only a built-in autofocus motor for all Nikon autofocus-lenses, but includes CPU and metering for older Nikon F-mount AI/AI-S lenses and the new generation perspective control lenses (PC-E).D300 User's Manual (EN) page 350: Compatible Lenses chart. http://www.nikonusa.com/pdf/manuals/dslr/D300_en.pdf The built-in intervalometer (timer) can be used for time-lapse low-light movies.Nikon digital SLRs used to capture stunning timelapse photos of Vancouver 1080p movie by TimeLapseHD Specifications * Nikon DX format 12.3 megapixel CMOS sensor * 1.5x field of view crop * Large, bright viewfinder with approximately 100% frame coverage and approximately 0.94 magnification * Nikon EXPEED image processor * Magnesium alloy weather-sealed body * Nikon F-mount lenses * Active D-Lighting (three levels) * 3D Color Matrix Metering II, using a 1005-pixel RGB sensor.

Shutterbug Magazine, and the UK magazine, \\"What Digital Camera\\" presented initial 'First Look' reviews. Imaging Resource and Photocrati also did their own initial reviews. DCR and Camera Labs have full reviews of the D300. Digital Review Canada compares it to the older Nikon D200. Popular Photography named the Nikon D300 for their official \\"Camera of the Year 2007\\" award. The magazine also reviewed the camera, and noted at that time that Nikon Capture NX software was packaged with the camera; more recent packages include a 30-day trial version. Accessories and software upgrades =MB-D10 Multi Power Battery Pack= MB-D10 Battery Pack The MB-D10 is an optional accessory battery pack that provides a vertical grip as well as additional shutter release and autofocus buttons, command dials and focus point selection control. The MB-D10 allows the D300 to be powered by an additional EN-EL3e battery or AA batteries. An optional carrier is available which allows for an EN-EL4 or EN-EL4a battery to be installed instead. The camera can be configured to assign priority to either the internal EN-EL3e battery or the MB-D10 grip such that the other battery is used only when the primary battery is dead. The D300 can shoot 8 frames per second with the MB-D10 & AA/EN- EL4/EN-EL4a battery installed, otherwise the camera is limited to a 6 frames per second 'shooting' mode. The MB-D10 is also compatible with the D700 but not the D200. ='D2X Mode' and firmware upgrade= On January 15, 2008, Nikon released three additional picture control modes for the D300 which emulate the D2X/D2XS color modes I, II and III. On February 14, 2008, Nikon released a firmware upgrade which resolves an issue where vertical banding can occur when long exposure noise reduction is enabled for shutter speeds of 8 seconds and slower. For several years there have been third-party firmware patches available for this and other Nikon Cameras. Some have added features while others have attempted to correct defects in the original firmware. =Replacement Cameras= Although the D7000 was released in 2011 D300S production continued in parallel until the release of the D500 in 2016. In February Nikon announced that the D7100 would replace the D300s as their flagship DX format camera; this would later be replaced in 2016 by the D500. The D7100 features the same Mutli-CAM D3500 DX module as the D300s. However, the controls of the D7000 series departed from the standard of the D200, D300, D700, and D800 cameras. The D500 returns to that format.

Known as the \\"Robin Hood of Pennsylvania\\", there are numerous stories of Lewis having \\"robbed from the rich to give to the poor\\". Many of these tales are more folklore than history, though there are several newspaper accounts from the period that describe Lewis as assisting the downtrodden, taking pity on some intended victims, and befriending many locals, who often assisted him in evading justice.

Lewis and his gang frequently used a network of caves throughout central Pennsylvania as hideouts and stores for stolen goods, one of which, Indian Caverns, is open to the public. Lewis was arrested several times and broke out of jail on every occasion. He was finally apprehended by a posse in 1820. He died from a gunshot wound received during his capture.

It is now recognised as an important centre of Turkish classical arts, run by the Foundation for the Service of Turkish Culture. There is an annual exhibition at the end of each year where students of various classes (ceramics, mosaics, etc.) are given a chance to show case their works which are preselected by their teachers for this particular exhibition. The medrese is located close to the Hagia Sophia - stairs lead down to it from the small street - and to Topkapi Palace. The structure is entered through the main gate which leads into the inner courtyard, around which the former learning rooms are located.

The villagers were not entirely clear on the meaning of the new name, only that the obscure final character was pronounced the same as \\"to bump (Á¢∞)\\" in their local dialect of Hainanese. The change began to cause inconvenience for the villagers because officials did not know how to enter the character into computers; villagers found themselves unable to obtain identity cards, marriage certificates, and other documents as a result. The final character in the village name, which means \\"deep mud\\", is present in the Big5 standard commonly used for traditional Chinese characters, where it has the code D5E4, as well as in Unicode, where its code point is U+6E74.

Holley III (November 24, 1926 ‚Äì October 5, 2012) was an American politician and dental surgeon. Holley became the first Black mayor of Portsmouth, Virginia, and ultimately the city's longest serving mayor, although both his mayoral terms (separated by a decade) ended with his being recalled from office. Thus he became the only known politician in American history to be twice recalled until Fullerton, California Councilman Don Bankhead was recalled in June 2012. Early life Holley was born in 1926. After graduating from Portsmouth's I. C. Norcom High School in 1944, Holley served in the United States Army during World War II, stationed in Camp Livingston in Louisiana. Following the war, he attended West Virginia State College (now West Virginia State University), and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1949. From there he went to Washington, D.C. where he attended dental school at the Howard University College of Dentistry, graduating in 1955. He has also received an honorary law degree from West Virginia State. He attended college on the G.I. Bill. During a reception in the late 1950s, Holley met Virginia Union University student Mary Walker; the couple would marry in 1960. Holley was active during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s, and played an integral role in the desegregation of Portsmouth, winning court battles which allowed for the equal use of the city's libraries, hospitals, restaurants and golf courses. In 1961, he and fellow dentist Dr. Hugo Owens, then the president of the local NAACP, requested service at the public library but were turned down because of their race, which ultimately led to the combination of that library with the segregated black library.Holladay and Burgess p. 394 During the course of his involvement in the civil rights movement, Holley entertained Martin Luther King Jr. at his home on multiple occasions. Politics Holley first served as a member of the Portsmouth City Council from 1968 to 1984, and was vice-mayor from 1978 to 1980. Upon his election in 1968, he became the first African American to serve on Portsmouth's City Council. He has twice held the office of mayor, first from July 1, 1984, to December 15, 1987, and again from July 1996 to July 13, 2010. Holley was also the first African American mayor in the city's history, and its longest serving mayor. His first term came to an end following an expense account scandal, becoming the first Virginia politician in modern times to be recalled. Hate mail sent to community leaders became another factor in his removal. His successor, Gloria O. Webb, former chairperson of the School Board, not only became Portsmouth's first female mayor, but also served uncontested for a decade.Holladay and Burgess p. 518 In May 2008 Holley narrowly defeated Martha Ann Creecy in the first contested mayoral election in Portsmouth since his 1996 victory. Holley was recalled for a second time on July 13, 2010. This second recall effort began in 2009 after an assistant made a confidential complaint of verbal abuse and of being required by Holley to perform his personal errands while working on city time. The accusations (leaked to the press) prompted the Portsmouth City Council to fine Holley $2,500 and ask him to retire, citing a pattern of mistreating subordinates. After Holley refused to retire, his opponents circulated a recall petition citing the allegations against him, which gathered 8000 signatures, which a judge deemed sufficient to place Holley's recall on the ballot for July 13, 2010. name=\\"russell\\"/> Though an Independent, Holley backed both Democrats and Republicans running for office, including Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid and former Senator George Allen's 2006 re-election bid. He also made a campaign contribution to Barack Obama. Holley also drew criticism in 2008 for suggesting that Portsmouth needed a \\"black\\" hotel to act as a counterbalance to the \\"white\\" Renaissance Hotel. Holley was an early supporter of the Renaissance; his portrait hangs in the lobby, and the hotel named its ballroom the \\"Holley Ballroom.\\" He later apologized for the remark, saying that his words were \\"misconstrued\\" and \\"misinterpreted.\\" Holley died in 2012, aged 85, after suffering a stroke. Fashion Holley was known for his stylish dress. He appeared in the September 2007 issue of Esquire along with former Virginia Beach mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf in a feature chronicling U.S. mayors.

As of 2014 three creations are extant. The Crofton Baronetcy, of The Mote in County Roscommon, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 1 July 1661 for Edward Crofton, as a reward for his record of loyalty to King Charles II during the English Civil War. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Lanesborough, and served as High Sheriff of Roscommon and High Sheriff of Leitrim. He was succeeded in the title by his son Edward, the second Baronet, who sat in the Irish House of Commons as member first for Boyle, and subsequently for Roscommon, and was a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1713-14. He was a prominent opponent of King James II of England, and was attainted by the Patriot Parliament of 1689, but recovered his estates the following year. His eldest son, the third baronet, also represented Roscommon in the House of Commons. The title became extinct on the death of the fifth Baronet in 1780. The Crofton Baronetcy, of The Mote in the County of Roscommon, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 12 June 1758 for Marcus Lowther-Crofton. He was the husband of Catherine, daughter of the fourth Baronet of the 1661 creation and had earlier assumed the surname of Crofton. For more information on this creation, see the Baron Crofton. The Crofton Baronetcy, of Mohill in the County of Leitrim, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 10 August 1801 for Morgan Crofton. The sixth Baronet was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the 2nd Life Guards and fought in the Second Boer War, where he was severely wounded at the Relief of Ladysmith, and in the two world wars. His diaries from the First World War are published as Massacre of the Innocents: The Crofton Diaries, Ypres 1914‚Äì1915 (2004). Another member of the family, James Crofton, grandson of Morgan Crofton, third son of the first Baronet, was a Lieutenant-General in the Army. The Crofton Baronetcy, of Longford House in the County of Sligo, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 18 August 1838 for James Crofton. He was descended from Thomas Crofton, uncle of the first Baronet of the 1661 creation.

The cliffs in which it occurs are frequently enveloped in low cloud and provide a relatively moist refugium occupying less than 5 km2, on an otherwise desertic island.

He is founder, owner and engineer of Wire Recording in south central Austin where he has recorded and worked with talent including Paul Leary, Sublime, Butthole Surfers, Canvas and Meat Puppets. Early life Sullivan was born in Michigan but grew up in West Lafayette, Indiana. He attended Indiana University (1979‚Äì83) in Bloomington and earned a bachelor's degree from the Marketing and Advertising School of Business. During his time as an undergrad Stuart enrolled in the Electronic Music program which evolved into the university's official Audio Program. While making his way through school, Stuart worked a number of sound/recording production gigs including Opera and Orchestra crewman (eventually becoming the crew manager for two years), teaching a class on the studio environment, and running PA systems in clubs and piano bars for a professor who owned a PA company in town. Stuart was also involved in a number of music projects including Contemporary Sounds Band, with drum major/doctoral student of composition Paul Sturm. After college, Sullivan moved to Austin in late 1983 and began interviewing for audio related jobs. He ended up getting a job at Texas French Bread to survive before landing an additional job with Bass Concert Hall at the University of Texas as the main sound person. Sullivan took on a third job with Lonestar Studio where he worked for $5/hr cleaning while paying $45/hr to use the studio. Stuart managed nine hours of cleaning for one hour of studio time (only at night) and made his first record with The Wildseeds in 1984. Soon after, Sullivan began a project with The Hickoids making a record of \\"destructive, reckless, absurd, stoned, drunk, sped out tweaked mess that happened to capture that mentality and people related to it.\\" The record was named Corntaminated. 19 years later in 2002 Bud Gaugh (drummer, Sublime), Krist Novoselic (bassist, Nirvana) and Curt Kirkwood (guitarist, Meat Puppets) formed a group called Eyes Adrift and came to Stuart at Wire to record an album. During conversation between sessions Krist and Bud mentioned one of their favorite inspiring records from childhood was a record called \\"Corntaminated\\" by The Hickoids. Career as producer Still working at Lonestar Studio in 1985, Sullivan became a staple in the scene and was asked to be house assistant for a new place, Arlyn Studio in Austin, assisting in the building and wiring design of the new studio. By 1987 Arlen was up and running and local bluesman Clifford Antone asked Stuart to make records for a new label he started called Antone's Records. From 1987 to 90 Sullivan made a variety of blues records, country records and even tejano records. Sullivan's first gold record was with Little Joe y Familia which sold 50,000 copies (50,000 copies is gold in the tejano music world). Stuart was also doing work at Willie Nelson's studio (Perdenales Studio) before the Perdanales was shut down for tax evasion, as well as working with Nick Lowe and producer Colin Farely who ran Power Plant Studios and Mason Rughe Studios in England. Shortly after that, Sullivan did a brief stint in London working at Air Studios in Oxford Circus as well as at MasterRock on a Focusrite Console 001. Sullivan returned to the US as the grunge scene was just starting to catch momentum and linked up with critically acclaimed producer Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers. Their first record together was a bluegrass record by the Bad Livers and by 1993 Curt Kirkwood of Meat Puppets asked Paul and Stuart to make a record called \\"Too High To Die\\", which went to gold status and promoted Leary and Sullivan within the developing grunge movement. Leary and Sullivan were found by major label work and recorded and produced a number of albums by bands including Sublime, Meat Puppets, Daniel Johnston, The Reverend Horton Heat, Pepper, The Refreshments and the Dead Milkmen. Work in Austin, Texas After some time in the Los Angeles music scene of the 1990s, Stuart Sullivan began buying up recording gear with intentions of opening a studio in Austin, which he did so in 2001. Wire Recording Studio opened for business under the direction of Sullivan and brought in acts from different genres and people from different parts of the world. In 2005 he began booking with outside engineers to use the studio in hopes of Wire Recording Studio \\"developing a sense of community and taking a progressive movement forward into professional service.\\" In February 2017, Anson Funderburgh and Don Ritter, agreed to produce Dany Franchi's third album Problem Child. The recording took place at the Wire Recording Studio. The album was released on May 18, 2018, and peaked at number 4 in the Billboard Top Blues Albums Chart in June 2018.

He was one of the best-known footballers of the 1920s and 1930s and was capped 26 times by England. Early life Crooks was born at Bearpark, County Durham, one of a family of 17 children. After leaving school, he worked in the coal-mines and played for the colliery team and then for Tow Law Town in his spare time until problems with rheumatism forced him to abandon his career underground. When his health was restored he joined Durham City in June 1926 and made 16 appearances for them in the Third Division (North). Derby County and England By April 1927, he had been spotted by George Jobey and was signed for Derby County for a fee of ¬£300, making his debut for The Rams in a 2‚Äì1 win over Leicester City on 10 September 1927. Between 1927 and 1946 he played 445 games for the Rams, scoring 111 goals. During this period, County were twice runners-up in the Football League, in 1930 and 1936. His first appearance for England was in a 5‚Äì2 victory against Scotland on 5 April 1930.England v Scotland 1930 line-ups at englandstats.com He then became a regular fixture in the England side, making 26 appearances and scoring 7 goals, including two in a 7‚Äì1 defeat of Spain on 9 December 1931. His final England appearance came in a 6‚Äì2 victory over Hungary on 2 December 1936, (playing alongside Derby County colleagues Raich Carter and Eric Keen).England v Hungary 1936 ‚Äì lineups at englandstats.com In 1935, Arsenal attempted to sign Crooks and Tom Cooper in exchange for Alex James, but the deal fell through as Arsenal required a cash payment as well which Derby were not prepared to meet. Crook's playing career was interrupted by World War II, but he made a handful of league appearances in the 1946‚Äì47 season before retiring. He was unlucky to miss Derby's FA Cup win of 1946 due to a knee injury, having scored in all of the earlier rounds. Management In December 1949, Crooks moved into management with Retford Town. In May 1950 he became manager of Shrewsbury Town, who had been elected to the Football League Division Three North for the 1950‚Äì51 season. He remained with the Shropshire side until 1954.* In 1954 he moved to Gresley Rovers turning out occasionally as a player, making his d√©but on Boxing Day 1954 in the Birmingham & District League at Burton Albion. There followed spells as manager with Burton Albion and Heanor Town. During this time he opened a sport clothing store in Derby. After finishing in local team management he became Derby County's Chief Scout (until 1967) and also served for 14 years as Secretary of the Association Football Players Union. His career has been marked by Durham City naming the upper lounge at New Ferens Park, 'The Sammy Crooks Lounge', which is home to some of the memorabilia from his playing career. Similarly, Belper Leisure Centre, situated in the town where he died, renamed the bar to 'The Sammy Crooks Suite'. References * Mortimer, Gerald (2004): The Who's Who of Derby County.

A fracture is a mathematical singularity to which the classical equations of continuum mechanics cannot be applied directly - Peridynamics offers a numerical method. Peridynamics is a formulation of continuum mechanics that is oriented toward deformations with discontinuities, especially fractures. Purpose The peridynamic theory is based on integral equations, in contrast with the classical theory of continuum mechanics, which is based on partial differential equations. Since partial derivatives do not exist on crack surfaces and other singularities, the classical equations of continuum mechanics cannot be applied directly when such features are present in a deformation. The integral equations of the peridynamic theory can be applied directly, because they do not require partial derivatives. The ability to apply the same equations directly at all points in a mathematical model of a deforming structure helps the peridynamic approach avoid the need for the special techniques of fracture mechanics. For example, in peridynamics, there is no need for a separate crack growth law based on a stress intensity factor. Definition and basic terminology The basic equation of peridynamics is the following equation of motion: :rho(x)ddot u(x,t)=int_R f(u(x',t)-u(x,t),x'-x,x)dV_{x'} + b(x,t) where x is a point in a body R, t is time, u is the displacement vector field, and rho is the mass density in the undeformed body. x' is a dummy variable of integration. The vector valued function f is the force density that x' exerts on x. This force density depends on the relative displacement and relative position vectors between x' and x. The dimensions of f are force per volume squared. The function f is called the \\"pairwise force function\\" and contains all the constitutive (material-dependent) properties. It describes how the internal forces depend on the deformation. The interaction between any x and x' is called a \\"bond.\\" The physical mechanism in this interaction need not be specified. It is usually assumed that f vanishes whenever x' is outside a neighborhood of x (in the undeformed configuration) called the horizon. Image:peridynamics-horizon.jpg The term \\"peridynamic,\\" an adjective, was proposed in the year 2000 and comes from the prefix peri, which means all around, near, or surrounding; and the root dyna, which means force or power. The term \\"peridynamics,\\" a noun, is a shortened form of the phrase peridynamic model of solid mechanics. Pairwise force functions Using the abbreviated notation u=u(x,t) and u'=u(x',t) Newton's third law places the following restriction on f: : displaystyle f(u-u', x-x', x') = -f(u'-u, x'-x, x) for any x, x', u, u'. This equation states that the force density vector that x exerts on x' equals minus the force density vector that x' exerts on x. Balance of angular momentum requires that f be parallel to the vector connecting the deformed position of x to the deformed position of x': :displaystyle ((x'+u')-(x+u))times f(u'-u, x'-x, x)=0. A pairwise force function is specified by a graph of f versus bond elongation e, defined by displaystyle e=(x'+u')-(x+u)-x'-x. A schematic of a pairwise force function for the bond connecting two typical points is shown in the following figure: Image:peridynamics-bondforce-schematic.jpg Damage Damage is incorporated in the pairwise force function by allowing bonds to break when their elongation exceeds some prescribed value. After a bond breaks, it no longer sustains any force, and the endpoints are effectively disconnected from each other. When a bond breaks, the force it was carrying is redistributed to other bonds that have not yet broken. This increased load makes it more likely that these other bonds will break. The process of bond breakage and load redistribution, leading to further breakage, is how cracks grow in the peridynamic model. Peridynamic states Computer model of the necking of an aluminum rod under tension. Colors indicate temperature increase due to plastic heating. Calculation performed with the Emu computer code using peridynamic states. The theory described above assumes that each peridynamic bond responds independently of all the others. This is an oversimplification for most materials and leads to restrictions on the types of materials that can be modeled. In particular, this assumption implies that any isotropic linear elastic solid is restricted to a Poisson ratio of 1/4. To address this lack of generality, the idea of \\"peridynamic states\\" was introduced. This allows the force density in each bond to depend on the stretches in all the bonds connected to its endpoints, in addition to its own stretch. For example, the force in a bond could depend on the net volume changes at the endpoints. The effect of this volume change, relative to the effect of the bond stretch, determines the Poisson ratio. With peridynamic states, any material that can be modeled within the standard theory of continuum mechanics can be modeled as a peridynamic material, while retaining the advantages of the peridynamic theory for fracture.

Composite construction is often used in building aircraft, watercraft, and building construction. There are several reasons to use composite materials including increased strength, aesthetics, and environmental sustainability.  Structural engineering  In structural engineering, composite construction exists when two different materials are bound together so strongly that they act together as a single unit from a structural point of view. When this occurs, it is called composite action. One common example involves steel beams supporting concrete floor slabs.Rahman, N. A., & Booth, M. (2006, August). Innovative Mid Rise Construction. Retrieved from Structure Magazine: http://www.structuremag.org/archives/2006/August-2006/C-CI-Innovative-Mid- Rise-Aug-06.pdf If the beam is not connected firmly to the slab, then the slab transfers all of its weight to the beam and the slab contributes nothing to the load carrying capability of the beam. However, if the slab is connected positively to the beam with studs, then a portion of the slab can be assumed to act compositely with the beam. In effect, this composite creates a larger and stronger beam than would be provided by the steel beam alone. The structural engineer may calculate a transformed section as one step in analyzing the load carry capability of the composite beam.  House building  A flitch beam is a simple form of composite construction sometimes used in North American light frame construction.http://www.structuremag.org/archives/2007/June%202007/D-From%20Exp%20Flitch%20Plates%20DeStefano- pac-5-10-07.pdf Structure Magazine This occurs when a steel plate is sandwiched between two wood joists and bolted together. A flitch beam can typically support heavier loads over a longer span than an all-wood beam of the same cross section.  Deck construction  =Composite wood decking= The traditional decking material is pressure-treated wood. The current material many contractors choose to use is composite decking. This material is typically made from wood-plastic composite or Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (FRP). Such materials do not warp, crack, or split and are as versatile as traditional pressure treated wood. Composite decking is made through several different processes, and there are a multitude of sizes, shapes, and strengths available. Depending on the type of composite selected the decking materials can be used for a number of other construction projects including fences and sheds.Composite Decking. (n.d.). Retrieved June 22, 2010, from ToolBase Services: =Composite steel deck= In a composite steel deck, the dissimilar materials in question are steel and concrete. A composite steel deck combines the tensile strength of steel with the compressive strength of concrete to improve design efficiency and reduce the material necessary to cover a given area. Additionally, composite steel decks supported by composite steel joists can span greater distances between supporting elements and have reduced live load deflection in comparison to previous construction methods.  Cement-polymer composites  Cement-polymer composites are being developed and tested as a replacement for traditional cement. The traditional cement used as stucco rapidly deteriorates. The deterioration causes the material to easily crack due to thermo-processes becoming permeable to water and no longer structurally sound. The United States Environmental Protection Agency in conjunction with Materials and Electrochemical Research Corporation tested a cement-polymer composite material consisting of crumb rubber made from recycled rubber tires and cement. It was found that 20% crumb rubber can be added to the cement mixture without affecting the appearance of the cement. This new material was tested for strength and durability using American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM International) standards.Loutfy, R. O. (2005, April 25). National Center For Environmental Research, US EPA. Retrieved June 14, 2010, from Final Report: Cement-Polymer Composites From Recycled Polymers for Construction: http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/6970/report/F  High-performance composites  A newer but growing sector in the composite construction sector is the high-performance decking that comes from companies like Trex Decking and Fiberon. High performance composite decking has emerged in recent years to combat earlier generations of composite decking like wood plastic composite (WPCs) that were struggling to maintain credibility in the marketplace. Research is showing now, however, that consumers are choosing composite decking products over wood 11 times to 1. Initial concerns regarding moisture intrusion in composite decks has led to the rise of high performance decking products with protective shells, often referred to as ‚Äúcapped composite decking.‚Äù Capped composite decks have a high performance finish with the addition of the shell that is often called a ‚Äúcap-stock.‚Äù This shell covers either all four sides of the composite board or just the top and sides, depending on the brand. Manufacturers apply the cap to the board using a process called co-extrusion. Most capped composite decking comes with some kind of warranty against stains and fading.

He is the founder and president of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation and author of With God on Our Side: One Man's War Against an Evangelical Coup in America's Military and No Snowflake in an Avalanche, both of which describe purported Christian evangelical and fundamentalist proselytizing by some members of the military. Military service and education Weinstein graduated with honors from the United States Air Force Academy in 1977. He has stated that while at the Academy he encountered a string of incidents of psychological harassment, including notes emblazoned with swastikas and anti-Semitic slurs, death threats, and two violent incidents of hazing where he was ambushed, beaten, and, in one case, hospitalized.Weinstein and Seay, pg. 188 Weinstein graduated from Cabrillo High School in Lompoc, California in 1973. He began his legal studies at McGeorge School of Law at the University of the Pacific. He enrolled in the university through the Air Force Law School Program shortly after his appointment as Chief of the Secure Systems Branch of the 2049th Communications and Installations Group at McClellan Air Force Base. Weinstein graduated with his Juris Doctor degree in 1981. Weinstein served for as both an air force sponsored law student and a practicing JAG officer with the U.S. Air Force Judge Advocate General's Corps for over ten years.Weinstein and Seay, p. 14. Legal and political career Weinstein spent over three years working in the West Wing of the Reagan Administration as legal counsel in the White House. He began with an appointment to the Office of Management and Budget and was soon named the Committee Management Officer of the Iran-Contra affair in his capacity as Assistant General Counsel of The White House Office of Administration, Executive Office of the President of the United States. Weinstein served as the first general counsel to Texas billionaire and two- time Presidential candidate H. Ross Perot and Perot Systems Corporation and left in 2006 to work full-time on the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF), a nonprofit foundation he founded in March 2006. This foundation was formed as a watchdog organization to protect religious freedom in the military in accordance with Department of Defense Directive 1300.17, \\"Accommodation of Religious Practices Within the Military Services\\". Activism Weinstein says both his sons were exposed to Christian proselytizing at the Academy. In the case of his younger son Curtis, he reported that it included anti-Semitic language and being asked \\"how it felt to kill Jesus\\". His elder son, Casey, a 2004 Academy graduate, alleged that \\"Senior cadets would sit down and say, 'How do you feel about the fact that your family is going to burn in hell?'\\"Harwood, Matt. Meet the military man battling dangerous Christian extremism in the military , Alternet.org; July 12, 2010. He wrote in his autobiography (Weinstein and Seay, p. 208): Describing his trajectory in an interview with LA Progressive that was published in April 2012, Weinstein said: In October 6, 2005, Weinstein sued the United States Air Force for failing to prevent religious proselytizing in the U.S. Air Force. U.S. District Judge James A. Parker dismissed the case of Weinstein v. U.S. Air Force and wrote: On September 17, 2007, the MRFF filed a federal lawsuitMRFF v. Gates, undated, militaryreligiousfreedom.org; accessed June 13, 2012. in Kansas City, Kansas, against then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and Major Freddy J. Welborn, accusing them of allowing a \\"pervasive and pernicious pattern and practice of unconstitutional religious rape of freedoms of our U.S. military\\".An Interview with Michael Weinstein, Philadelphia Jewish Voice, February 2008; accessed June 13, 2012. On March 5, 2008, the lawsuit was re- filed to include allegations that co-plaintiff Army Specialist Jeremy Hall was denied a promotion due to the filing of the original lawsuit. Following the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, Weinstein suggested that proselytizing by \\"fundamentalist Christians\\" may have created a hostile environment that contributed to the psychological pressure on Major Nidal Malik Hasan. Hasan reportedly had claimed he faced harassing insults related to his Arab ethnic background and Islamic faith.Philip Sherwell, \\"Fort Hood shooting: Nidal Malik Hasan 'said Muslims should rise up'\\", telegraph.co.uk, November 6, 2009; accessed June 13, 2012. In November 2009, the American Family Association issued the statement \\"No More Muslims in the US Military\\", which called for Muslim military enlistees to be barred from military service in the United States armed forces on the grounds that \\"...just as Christians are taught to imitate the life of Christ, so Muslims are taught to imitate the Prophet in all things. Yesterday, Nidal Malik Hasan was simply being a good Muslim.\\"\\"No More Muslims in the U.S. Military\\" , afa.net; accessed November 13, 2016. Weinstein's denunciation of the AFA position as \\"bigoted, racist, [and] vile\\" was featured prominently by Hatewatch, the official blog of the Southern Poverty Law Center civil rights organization.\\"Violate the Constitution? Christian Right Group Says Yes\\", splcenter.org; retrieved July 25, 2011. In 2011, the US Air Force, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by the Foundation, revised a training course taught to nuclear missile launch officers which included quotations from Wernher von Braun and also cited Christian Just War Theory, among other materials.Air Force suspends ethics course that used Bible passages to train missile launch officers, washingtonpost.com, August 2, 2011. Radio host Michael Savage criticized Weinstein, saying, \\"What Weinstein doesn't know was if it was not for the warrior mentality of the Christians he hates so much, who rescued his ancestors from the ovens of Bergen-Belsen and Auschwitz, Mickey Whine-[something edited out] wouldn't be here plaguing the United States of America.\\"Rodda, Chris. \\"Michael Savage Attacks Mikey Weinstein Over Stopping of Air Force \\"Jesus Loves Nukes\\" Training\\", huffingtonpost.com; accessed October 14, 2016. Weinstein responded in a newsletter to his audience, saying that Savage's \\"stupefying rant\\" was \\"a rabidly ad-hominem, personal assault ... which should serve as a particularly revealing clue as to the psychological state of this specimen, a professional bottom-feeding hyena who earns his daily bread by foaming at the mouth and spreading extremist hysteria which he likely doesn't even believe himself.\\" In March 2011, Weinstein submitted a written testimony to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights for a hearing entitled \\"Protecting the Civil Rights of American Muslims\\". He expounded on the varied complaints and injustices made by Muslim clients who have purportedly been subjected to pejoratives and racial slurs, such as \\"towel head\\", \\"raghead\\", or \\"camel jockey\\", on a regular basis. In December 2011, he resubmitted a written statement on the same subject. This statement went into more detail on the origins and effects of Islamophobia in the U.S. military. Weinstein pointed out several relatively prominent figures in the U.S. military hierarchy, particularly the chaplaincy, who advocated for what Weinstein said are Islamophobic policies and behaviors. He also pointed to an alleged culture of Dominionist Christianity as a contributor to the trend. In January 2012, No Snowflake in an Avalanche was released. The book, co-authored by Weinstein and Davin Seay, details MRFF's prominent case studies and struggles, as well as the violent impediments that continue to be imposed against MRFF by its opponents. He supported the book release with nationwide speaking and book signing tour which includes one bookstore in Albuquerque, NM being forced by public pressure to reverse its decision to deny an in-store appearance due to \\"controversy\\" surrounding the event. When protests broke out in various parts of Afghanistan over the improper disposal of copies of the Quran at the US military Bagram Air Base, for which the US apologized, protesters shouted \\"Death to America\\" and burned U.S. flags. In a MRFF statement, Weinstein noted that the desecrations of the Muslim holy book by U.S. personnel revealed \\"a fatal attitude of patronizing colonial hostility [that] has indeed been allowed to hijack the US mission in Afghanistan. By adding grist to the mill of escalating regional resentment, America's own religious extremists, racists and anti-Muslim bigots within the military have ensured that they and their comrades in arms will continue to pay the awful price in spilled blood ... the real-world consequence of this intrinsically ingrained religious prejudice and bigotry is the loss of service members' lives and limbs.\\" In 2012 Weinstein sued former chaplain Gordon Klingenschmitt for issuing an imprecatory prayer that he equated to a fatwa. The suit was dismissed by the judge, who stated that Weinstein failed to connect the prayer to any subsequent threats or actions against him. Weinstein is often mistakenly characterized as an atheist, a charge he and his defenders vociferously deny on the basis of him being \\"a Jewish agnostic who still prays three times a day in Hebrew ... definitely not an atheist.\\" News sources announced that permission granted to use military emblems on Holman Military Bibles had been revoked. B&H; Publishing Group being notified in 2011 that the decision was made based on new military trademark licensing issues. In February 2013, the Air Force Academy posted a link to a homophobic site as a guide to Jewish holidays. Weinstein was contacted by around 22 AFA staff members, faculty, and cadets who asked that the link be removed. He expressed \\"profound bewilderment, shock, and no small amount of disgust\\" at the inclusion of a such a website in official AFA material, calling it \\"Pernicious, homophobic, and clearly misogynistic.\\" In response to Weinstein's demands the Air Force Academy spokesman, Lt. Col. John Bryan, said he wasn't sure how or why the links were included. He does say that it was most likely an oversight and that \\"nobody does things maliciously here.\\" In April 2013, Weinstein met with top-level officials in the Pentagon to discuss proselytizing in the U.S. military and the role of the chaplaincy. He called it a \\"national security threat ... spiritual rape ... sedition and treason.\\" In an interview with the Washington Post after that meeting, Weinstein blamed military and political leadership for the abundance of proselytizing going on the military today. Weinstein again claimed the culture in the military is misogynistic, anti-Semitic, and Islamophobic and that the chain of command is compliant to this culture. In October 2013, Lt. Colonel Chaplain Stephen W. Austin contacted Weinstein on October 8, 2013, regarding initial development and implementation of a spirit(ual) dimension component to a U.S. Army soldier resilience platform called ArmyFit. Lt. Col. Austin requested MRFF's advice and review \\"as we progress in the development of this dimension. Your opinion matters and we would like to work collaboratively on a topic that is clearly complex and sensitive.\\" In December 2013, Weinstein was contacted by a Jewish member of a State National Guard regarding specific actions taken against him by his chain of command in response to his religious beliefs. The Brigadier- General of the State's National Guard initiated an investigation into the claims made. The investigation resulted in several high-ranking members of the chain of command being fired, reprimanded, or going back into training. On November 7, 2014, the U.S. Air Force created controversy when it updated its rules on religious neutrality. Two instances in particular were the focus of intense debate. First, the new draft dropped language that required airmen to \\"avoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs to subordinates or extend preferential treatment for any religion.\\" And second, the new draft changed language that stated, \\"Airmen, especially commanders and supervisors, must ensure that in exercising their right of religious free expression, they do not degrade morale, good order, and discipline in the Air Force\\", to language that stated, \\"expression of sincerely held beliefs (conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs) shall not be prohibited unless the expression would have a real, not hypothetical, adverse impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, good order and discipline, health and safety, and mission accomplishment.\\" Weinstein claimed instances of the new language severely weakened the rules on religious neutrality and opened the door to discriminatory language, particularly towards LGBT airmen, being protected as sincerely held religious beliefs. On November 19, 2014, Weinstein appeared before the Military Personnel Subcommittee to testify on the current state of religion in the military. After Weinstein's opening statements he was questioned regarding some statements he had made in the past by Rep. Randy Forbes (R-VA). Following that, Rep. Walter Jones Jr. (R-NC) asked a series of questions to Weinstein asking that he respond with \\"fair\\" or \\"unfair\\". Weinstein took severe issue with this line of questioning and his responses caused Rep. Jones to leaves the chamber before recess was called. In October 2015, Weinstein sent a letter to Lt. Col. Don Tasker, the commanding officer of the 436th Force Support Squadron at Dover Air Force Base, to report that one of Tasker's subordinates was illegally using her official government email to endorse and encourage participation in Operation Christmas Child, an annual charitable event created and led by Samaritan's Purse that explicitly endorses the Christian faith and encourages evangelization for that faith. Shortly after receipt of this letter, Tasker disavowed the email and stated, \\"I want to be absolutely clear that the email in question was not sent at my direction and is not endorsed in any way by me or any level of command.\\" In October 2015, Weinstein was contacted regarding a practice of a regional supervisor at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Directorate of Contracting. This supervisor signed his emails with various Bible quotes, a practice in violation of the U.S. Military's rules on religious neutrality. Weinstein successfully demanded the practice cease and the supervisor be disciplined. In January 2016, eight U.S. Air Force officers contacted Weinstein concerning an explicitly religious speech given by a new commanding officer at their base: This speech was followed by an invitation to silent prayer for the entire gathered base. Weinstein intervened and rendered assistance to the eight officers in the form of contacting the chain of command. The officer received a reprimand and sent a personal apology letter to the eight officers who contact Weinstein. In February 2016, Weinstein was instrumental in the functional demotion of a Pentagon fitness blog writer, Colonel Thomas Hundley. The writer in question published a post recommending various Christian exercises, including prayer, as a way to increased fitness. Weinstein and his non-profit foundation MRFF filed a complaint with Army Regional Health Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia after being informed of the post by several military service members. In the complaint, Weinstein accused Col. Hundley of \\"conflating his Army officer rank, title, and position with his professed evangelical Christian faith.\\" Several days later the Defense Health Agency (DHA), released a brief notice informing readers that Col. Hundley was no longer a featured writer and they were \\"expanding the pool of writers ...\\" A football game between West Point and Temple University in September 2016 ended in controversy as the head coach of the West Point team, Jeff Monken, had the team gather around and participate in a prayer in celebration of their upset victory. After the game, a video was posted online showing the prayer. That video was removed shortly after the controversy arose and was replaced by one that depicted an abridged version of the team's locker room celebration. A parent of one of the students said that \\"Coach Monken had no business telling my son and his Army teammates to get on their knees and pray a prayer to Jesus! My son was very upset about this. ... This violates the Constitution and to think it happened at West Point?\\" Weinstein, upon hearing of the incident, stated, \\"We want three things, an admission that there was a mistake, an apology, and assurances that this won't happen again.\\" Coach Monken apologized to his players and assured that the behavior would not be repeated. In December 2016, an Air Force Academy coach was using his Twitter account to post religious quotes. Weinstein, via the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, filed a request for an official investigation into the coach to verify the tweets, and to discipline the coach if the allegations proved to be true. The tweets were removed from the account and the coach was ordered to display an appropriate disclaimer on his personal Twitter to denote that it is not an official Academy account. In 2011, Weinstein filed a FOIA request with USAFA for records regarding himself and his family, several of whom also graduated from the academy. After four years of \\"processing delays\\", he filed a lawsuit through the MRFF in 2015. The two-year legal battle ended with USAFA producing over 8,000 documents regarding Weinstein and MRFF, conducting new searches, expanding the date range of new searches, and paying legal fees MRFF incurred during the proceedings. In February 2017, Weinstein was contacted by five U.S. Army soldiers concerning a statement made by their CO, who had reportedly stated that \\"it was the army's priority to come to the Lord Jesus Christ.\\" The soldiers contacted Weinstein and MRFF because their unit had many non- Christian soldiers serving in it, several of whom took offense to the above statement. Weinstein contacted the commander's superiors and the commander was ordered to desist from engaging in the objectionable behavior. Weinstein and the National Organization for Women cooperated in February 2017 to remove posters from the lobby of Air Combat Command at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia. The posters prominently featured the quote: Complaints were submitted on February 7, and the posters were removed later that month. Awards and recognition In 2006, Weinstein was named by The Jewish Daily Forward in the \\"Forward 50\\", a list of those it considers to be the most influential Jews in America. He received the Buzzflash Wings of Justice Award. Jews for Racial and Economic Justice awarded him its Rabbi Marshall T. Meyer Risk-Taker Award for taking extraordinary risks in pursuit of justice. In December 2012, Weinstein was named one of the \\"100 Most Influential People in U.S. Defense\\" by Defense News. Criticism Weinstein has been accused of \\"waging a war on Christianity\\" by some critics. He has described \\"gangs of fundamentalist Christian monsters who terrorize their fellow Americans by forcing their weaponized and twisted version of Christianity upon their helpless subordinates\\", and has said that the vast majority of his clients are practicing Catholics and mainline Protestants. Weinstein has come under criticism for his salary and practice of voting on his own compensation as he is one of the voting members of MRFF's three-member board. According to Weinstein, although he is a voting board member, he abstains from any votes on his own salary and has always done so. Supporters have noted this criticism comes from the same media source which had named Weinstein one of the 100 Most Influential People in U.S. Defense in December 2012 and that the study upon which this criticism was based noted, \\"If you come across a charity whose CEO pay is higher than other similar charities, don't immediately dismiss that charity's request for funding. You're better off supporting a charity that is fiscally efficient, accountable and transparent, achieving its programmatic goals and paying its CEO well, than a charity that has substandard fiscal health, fails to live up to its mission, but under-pays its CEO.\\" This compensation policy for charity CEOs has been expressed by other reputable sources. Jews in Green, a Jewish military support group, has challenged some of his claims, such as an entrenched anti-Semitism in the military, calling them baseless. Personal background Weinstein and his wife have two sons and one daughter. His elder son and daughter-in-law are 2004 graduates of the USAFA. His younger son graduated in 2007, and his son-in-law is a 2010 graduate of the Air Force Academy. Seven total members of the Weinstein family have attended the Academy. His father is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy. Weinstein graduated from the McGeorge School of Law at University of the Pacific (United States) in 1981. Media Weinstein appeared in the film adaptation of James Carroll's Constantine's Sword. Weinstein has appeared on major cable and network TV news networks and is a frequent guest on national radio networks. He has written for The Washington Post, AlterNet, and Truthout. His activism has been covered in such media as CNN,Randi Kaye, \\"Atheist soldier sues Army for 'unconstitutional' discrimination\\", cnn.com, July 9, 2008; accessed June 13, 2012.

Eden Park is an urban park located in the Walnut Hills and Mt. Adams neighborhoods of Cincinnati, Ohio. The hilltop park occupies , and offers numerous overlooks of the Ohio River valley. History Eden Park Stand Pipe. Vintage stereoscopic view of former Eden Park Reservoir The park's acreage was purchased by the city in 1869 from Nicholas Longworth, a prominent Cincinnati landowner and horticulturist, who had previously used it as a vineyard. Longworth called his scenic estate the \\"Garden of Eden,\\" after the biblical Garden of Eden, and the name was partially retained for the park. The park area was originally designed by noted landscape architect Adolph Strauch, who also was responsible for Spring Grove Cemetery. The city constructed a , 96 million gallon reservoir between 1866 and 1878. The Eden Park Station No. 7 pumped water from the Ohio River into the reservoir and then into the Eden Park Stand Pipe. The reservoir was removed in the early 1960s and the site redeveloped into the Mirror Lake reflecting pool and baseball fields. The former reservoir's dam, Eden Park Station No. 7, and Eden Park Stand Pipe still stand as historical remnants. Architecture and institutions Eden Park holds a number of city landmarks and landscape features. The Elsinore Arch, built in 1883, serves as a natural entrance to the park. The 1904 Spring House Gazebo is the oldest enduring structure in a Cincinnati park, and as an icon of the entire park system it appears in the logo of the Cincinnati Park Board. The Park Board Administration building is situated by the Gilbert Avenue entrance. The Cincinnati Art Museum complex is located in the park. It is linked to the Elsinore Arch via a flight of wooded hillside Cincinnati steps. The Art Academy of Cincinnati was formerly adjacent to the Art Museum, until relocating to the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. Live entertainment venues include Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park and the Seasongood Pavilion, a natural amphitheater built in 1959 and named for Cincinnati mayor Murray Seasongood. The Krohn Conservatory is a Gothic Revival and Art Deco Style public conservatory completed in 1933. A flight of Cincinnati steps lead from Krohn Conservatory to the Presidents' Grove trail through a row of trees planted in honor of U.S. presidents. The first tree, an oak planted in 1882, honors George Washington. The Twin Lakes area features a footbridge traversing adjoining lakes, at the site of a former quarry. Near the footbridge is a grove of buckeye trees (Aesculus glabra), the state tree of Ohio. Public art at the Twin Lakes includes the Capitoline Wolf Statue replica, a gift of the City of Rome, and the statue of a cormorant fisher, a gift from Cincinnati's sister city Gifu in Japan. Two structures at the Twin Lakes, a concession stand and comfort station, were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1937. A road from the Twin Lakes leads past the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and over the historic Melan Arch Bridge to the Eden Park Overlook near the park's highest point. The Ohio River Monument stands overlooking the river valley. It was dedicated by President Herbert Hoover in 1929 to commemorate canalization of the river for year-round water transport.

Polish Chief of State J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski surreptitiously ordered ≈ªeligowski to carry out the operation, and revealed the truth several years later. The area was formally annexed by Poland in 1922 and internationally recognized as Polish territory in 1923. Nevertheless, Lithuania continued to claim the Vilnius region. Background General Lucjan ≈ªeligowski In late 1920, the Polish-Soviet War was ending with the Soviets defeated at the Battle of Warsaw and in full retreat. The disputed Vilnius region centered on the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius (Polish Wilno), which had been founded by the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas in 1323 and had been the Lithuanian capital ever since. Vilnius had been occupied by the Soviets during their summer 1920 offensive. The Soviets returned the region to the Lithuanians because the latter had allowed Soviet troops to move through Lithuanian territory and engaged Polish forces in the disputed territories (see Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920, and Polish-Lithuanian War). This move allowed the Soviets to retain tactical control of the region, deny it to the Poles, and increase the already high tensions between the Poles and Lithuanians, both of whom claimed the disputed territory as their own. Piotr ≈Åossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920 (The Polish-Lithuanian Conflict, 1918‚Äì1920), Warsaw, KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza, 1995, , pp. 112‚Äì6.Piotr ≈Åossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, pp. 112‚Äì28. In early October 1920, under international pressure from the Spa and Suwa≈Çki Conferences, Piotr ≈Åossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, pp. 166‚Äì75. the Poles and Lithuanians signed a ceasefire in the Sudova region, but, with the issue of Vilnius remaining under Lithuanian control, the issue was unresolved. The Poles rested their claim on then current ethnographic considerations, as approximately 65% of the inhabitants of the city at the time were Polish-speakers, while Lithuanians constituted approximately 1-2% of the city's population.Piotr Eberhardt. Ethnic Groups and Population Changes in Twentieth-Century Central- Eastern Europe: History, Data, Analysis. M.E. Sharpe. 2003. p. 39. Lithuania pointed to Vilnius as its historical capital and denied Polish claims to it as baseless.Michael MacQueen, The Context of Mass Destruction: Agents and Prerequisites of the Holocaust in Lithuania, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Volume 12, Number 1, pp. 27-48, 1998, The Poles did not wish to continue the war as the Polish army was tired, and Polish Chief of State J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski was still hoping to create a Miƒôdzymorze federation, to include a Lithuania friendly to Poland, but wanted to ensure that Vilnius would be part of a Polish sphere of influence. From the Lithuanian point of view, that was highly unlikely, as many Lithuanians saw Polish influence as pernicious and had wanted to be rid of Polish influence from as far back as the marriage of Grand Duke Jogaila to the then 11-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland in 1386. In particular, Lithuanian nationalists opposed any further connection to Poland, especially after the Polish occupation of Vilnius. The negotiations on the future of the disputed area, held under the auspice of a Conference of Ambassadors in Brussels and Paris, reached a stalemate, and Pi≈Çsudski feared that the Entente might accept the fait accompli that had been created by the Soviets' transfer of territorial control to Lithuania. Poland and Lithuania were to adhere to a mutually agreed upon ceasefire in Suwa≈Çki Region on October 10, but the Poles decided to circumvent the ceasefire by creating a \\"fait accompli\\" of their own. Pi≈Çsudski concluded that the best course of action would be one that supported the pro-Polish faction in Lithuania, but that could not be traced directly to Poland. However, his plans for a coup d'√©tat in 1919 had been foiled by the premature and unplanned Sejny Uprising, which had led to the destruction of the Polish Military Organization (P.O.W.) intelligence network in Lithuania by the Lithuanian Army and State Security Department.

Mutiny Polish ethnographic map from 1912, according to pre-war censuses Map of the Polish population living in Central Lithuania c. 1920 In October 1920, Polish General Lucjan ≈ªeligowski, a native of the historic lands of Lithuania, was given command of the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Infantry Division (comprising mostly individuals from the Kresy). Grzegorz ≈Åukowski and Rafal E. Stolarski, Walka o Wilno.

The Polish government would officially deny its involvement, thereby preserving its reputation on the international scene.Piotr ≈Åossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, pp. 161‚Äì6. ≈ªeligowski, like Pi≈Çsudski himself‚Äîmay have been one of many who were torn between Lithuanian and Polish identities; possibly, in proclaiming a Central Lithuania, he honestly believed that he was creating a Lithuania even if it that was dominated by Polish culture rather than Lithuanian culture.Endre Bojt√°r, Foreword to the Past: A Cultural History of the Baltic People, Central European University Press, 1999, , Print, p. 202. On October 6, 1920, ≈ªeligowski informed his officers of the plans for mutiny; at that point, no one under his command knew that he was acting with Pi≈Çsudski's backing, and some refused to follow him. Support for ≈ªeligowski wavered to such an extent that on October 7, he messaged Pi≈Çsudski that he could not carry out the operation due to lack of support among his troops. Eventually, however, most of the officers and men decided to follow him, and he proceeded with the operation. Piotr ≈Åossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, pp. 175‚Äì79. Polish caricature: a Lithuanian trying to stop General ≈ªeligowski from taking Wilno (Vilnius) ≈ªeligowski's forces set out on the morning of October 8 (two days before the Suwa≈Çki Agreement ceasefire was to take hold). That day, he declared that he would \\"liberate Wilno from Lithuanian occupation\\" and \\"form a parliament which will decide the fate of the disputed territories.\\" ≈ªeligowski's forces‚Äînumbering some 14,000, centered on his 1st Lithuanian- Belarusian Infantry Division‚Äîdefeated the Lithuanian 4th Infantry Regiment near the R≈´dininkai Forest, and again in a skirmish near Ja≈°i≈´nai. Polish forces reached the vicinity of Vilnius, but were slowed enough to delay their taking the city until the next day. The death toll, as reported by contemporary sources, was low: \\"a few casualties\\" on both sides. \\"Wypadki wile≈Ñskie\\" (\\"Wilno Events\\"), Robotnik (The Worker), October 20, 1920, p. 3. The Lithuanian forces in the region were heavily outnumbered: they not only faced ≈ªeligowski's numerically superior regular forces, supported by Polish Army logistics, but also had to garrison Vilnius, whose Polish population was restless. On October 9, the Lithuanian forces were unable to defend Vilnius and evacuated the city, with only token attempts at defending it (the decision to evacuate was made in the afternoon of October 8, and the evacuation took place during the night of October 8‚Äì9). When Polish units assaulted the remaining Lithuanian defenses around Vilnius, the city's Polish population supported the Polish troops, with militia units staging an uprising and engaging Lithuanian units still in the city, and civilians welcoming the Polish troops as they entered Vilnius. Lithuanian government representatives (led by Ignas Jonynas) passed control of the city to resident Entente officials (led by French colonel Constantin Reboul). ≈ªeligowski, however, refused to recognize their authority, and they were forced to leave the city.Piotr ≈Åossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, pp. 179‚Äì185 Gen. ≈ªeligowski leading his soldiers, Wilno (Vilnius), 1920 On October 12, ≈ªeligowski proclaimed the independence of the area as the Republic of Central Lithuania, with Vilnius as its capital. Most historians agree that the state was dependent on Poland, but they disagree to what extent (Polish historian Jerzy J. Lerski calls it a puppet state).Jerzy J. Lerski, Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966‚Äì1945, 1996, Google Print, p. 309. Meanwhile, a uniformed Polish armed force of 20 airplanes and the 13th Cavalry Regiment under the command of Col. Butkiewicz joined the mutiny. The Polish Army, however, was officially bound by the Suwa≈Çki Agreement ceasefire and did not engage the Lithuanian units by the line. On October 20‚Äì21 there were further battles between Central and Lithuanian forces near the village of Pikeli≈°kiai. On November 7, ≈ªeligowski's army began to advance upon Giedraiƒçiai, ≈†irvintos and Kƒódainiai. ≈ªeligowski's proposals of a cease-fire were ignored by Lithuania. ≈ªeligowski ignored League of Nations's Military Control Commission proposals to withdraw to October 20‚Äì21 lines and begin negotiations. On November 17, Soviet Russia offered military aid, which the Lithuanians declined. Polish cavalry broke Lithuanian defense lines and on November 18 reached Kavarskas and continued toward Kaunas. However, on November 19‚Äì21, the Lithuanian main forces pushed ≈ªeligowski's main forces back near Giedraiƒçiai and ≈†irvintos. In Polish literature, it is considered a local skirmish of minor importance.Piotr ≈Åossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, p. 217. Both sides were now exhausted. With the help of the League of Nations, on November 20 a ceasefire was negotiated, to take effect on November 21, 1920, at 9 o'clock in the morning; until then, both sides agreed to take no offensive actions. The Lithuanian 7th Infantry Regiment counterattacked at Giedraiƒçiai on the night of November 20‚Äì21, just before the ceasefire was to go into effect, persisting even after the ceasefire (until 14:00); this offensive gained Giedraiƒçiai for the Lithuanians. The Lithuanian forces stopped after a strong-wordedrequest from the League of Nations, and a truce was finally signed on November 29.Text in League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 9, pp. 64-67Piotr ≈Åossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, pp. 216‚Äì8. It was at this time that the close ally of Pi≈Çsudski, Micha≈Ç Pius R√∂mer, a leader of the Krajowcy movement, broke with Pilsudski and made the decision to side with the re-established Lithuanian Republic, even though Pi≈Çsudski offered to appoint him Prime Minister of the Republic of Central Lithuania. Aftermath The Republic of Central Lithuania (shown in green) ≈ªeligowski became the new state's de facto military dictator, but after elections he relinquished his powers to the newly elected parliament. c. 1925 Lithuanian poster, which urges to recapture the Vilnius Region In 1922 Central Lithuania's parliament voted for their state's incorporation into Poland.A. Srebrakowski, Sejm Wile≈Ñski 1922 roku. Idea i jej realizacja, Wroc≈Çaw 1993 In 1923, soon after the League of Nations had recognized the existing situation and accepted the Polish-Lithuanian border on March 15, Pi≈Çsudski on August 24, 1923 would publicly admit that ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny had in fact been a pre- planned operation carried out with his knowledge and support.George Slocombe, A Mirror to Geneva: Its Growth, Grandeur, and Decay, 1970. Google Print, p. 263 Despite Poland's claim to Vilnius, the League of Nations asked Poland to withdraw. Poland declined. In principle, British and French troops could have been asked to enforce the League‚Äôs decision. France, however, did not wish to antagonize Poland, a possible ally in a future war against Germany, and Britain was not prepared to act alone. Thus, the Poles were able to keep Vilnius, where a provisional government (Komisja RzƒÖdzƒÖca Litwy ≈örodkowej, the Central Lithuanian Governing Commission) was formed. Soon parliamentary elections were held and the Wilno Diet (Sejm wile≈Ñski) voted on February 20, 1922, for incorporation into Poland as the capital of a Wilno Voivodship. The elections were not recognized by the League of Nations. The League of Nations Conference of Ambassadors accepted the status quo in 1923, but the Wilno region remained in dispute between Poland and Lithuania (the latter still treated Vilnius as its constitutional capital and the capital of the Vilnius region). In Poland, the Mutiny was supported by some groups, such as the Christian Democrats \\"Wilno,\\" in Rzeczpospolita (The Republic), October 11, 1920, p. 3. and the left, Tadeusz Ho≈Ç√≥wko, \\"Sp√≥r o Wilno\\" (\\"The Dispute over Wilno\\"), in Robotnik (The Worker), October 28, 1920, p. 1. but criticized by the right-wing National Democrats. \\"G≈Çosy w sprawie Wilna\\" (\\"Voices in the Matter of Wilno\\"), in Kurjer Warszawski (The Warsaw Courier), October 13, 1920, p. 8. The coup resulted in a serious rift between Pilsudski and Ignacy Jan Paderewski, who had played a major role in creating international support for the independence of Poland. According to historian Timothy Snyder, the annexation of Vilnius by Poles pushed Lithuanian politicians from political towards ethnic understanding of the nation and gave arguments to radical politicians in Lithuania and also in Poland. Lithuania refused to recognize Central Lithuania. Polish-Lithuanian relations began to normalize after League of Nations negotiations in 1927, but it was not until the 1938 ultimatum issued by Poland that Lithuania was forced to establish diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accept its neighbor's borders. The Polish- Lithuanian conflict, however, left worsened relations between the two countries for decades to come, and modern Vilnius is now part of Lithuania.

Reign  The eldest son of Alexander III of Imereti by his first wife, Bagrat V succeeded on his father's death in 1660. His influential stepmother Darejan made him marry her niece, Ketevan. However, a year later, Darejan disrupted the union and offered Bagrat herself as a bride. On the king's refusal, Darejan had him arrested and blinded. The queen dowager then remarried an insignificant aristocrat, Vakhtang Tchutchunashvili, and had him crowned as king. The move drew many nobles into opposition. They enlisted the Ottoman and Mingrelian support and restored Bagrat. Darejan was exiled to Akhaltsikhe, in the Ottoman-held Georgian province. In 1668, Bagrat was once again dethroned by Darejan‚Äôs party with the military support of the pasha of Akhaltsikhe. However, both Darejan and her favorite were soon murdered, and Bagrat reclaimed the crown in 1669. These events had been closely watched by the royal court in Tbilisi, eastern Georgia. King Vakhtang V Shahnawaz of Kartli, whose cooperation with the Persian suzerains allowed him to bring the whole eastern Georgia under his control, campaigned in Imereti and crowned his son Archil as king of Imereti in 1678. Under pressure from the Ottomans, however, Archil was soon recalled from Kutaisi, and Bagrat was replaced on the throne again in 1679.  Family  Bagrat was married three times. His first wife was Ketevan, daughter of Prince David of Kakheti, whom he divorced in 1661. He married secondly Tatia, daughter of Constantine I, Prince of Mukhrani, and repudiated the union in 1663 to marry her sister, Tamar (died 1683). He had two sons and three daughters: * Alexander IV (died 1695), born of a concubine, was King of Imereti from 1691 to 1695. * Prince Giorgi (1676‚Äì1678), born of Bagrat's marriage to Tamar of Mukhrani. * Princess Darejan (died after 1726), who was married successively to Prince Giorgi III Gurieli (died 1684), Prince Paata Abashidze (died 1684), and Papuna II, Duke of Racha (died 1696). * Princess Mariam (died c. 1726), who was married successively to Prince Iese Chikovani (died c. 1703) and Shoshita III, Duke of Racha (died 1729). * Princess Tinatin (1678‚Äì1760), who was married to Prince Giorgi Gurieli and then Prince Levan IV Dadiani (died 1691). She became a nun under the name of Nino in 1704 and followed the suite of Vakhtang VI of Kartli in the Russian Empire in 1724.

It belongs to the evergreen tree genus Persea of about 150 species, of which the avocado, P. americana, is the best known. It is found in the Azores, Madeira, and Canary Islands in Macaronesia. It is threatened by habitat loss. It is the vegetable symbol of the island of La Gomera. Overview The family Lauraceae was part of Gondwanaland flora. There they spread over most of the continent. The genus Persea died out in increasingly xerophytic Africa, starting with the freezing of Antarctica about 20 million years ago and the formation of the Benguela current. The genus is extinct in Africa, save for P. indica, which survives in the fog shrouded mountains of the Canary Islands, which with Madagascar, constitute Africa's Laurel forest plant refugia. Fossil evidence indicates that the genus originated in West Africa during the Paleocene, and spread to Asia, to South America, and to Europe and thence to North America. It is thought that the gradual drying of Africa, west Asia, and the Mediterranean from the Oligocene to the Pleistocene, and the glaciation of Europe during the Pleistocene, caused the extinction of the genus across these regions, resulting in the present distribution. Persea indica is a species exclusive to Laurisilva, since this habitat is constantly threatened by encroaching agriculture, the laurel forest animal or vegetal species had already become rare in many of its former habitats and are threatened by habitat loss. Fossil record Fossils of Persea indica have been described from the fossil flora of Kƒ±zƒ±lcahamam district in Turkey, which is of early Pliocene age.Kasaplƒ±gil, B.-(1975): Pliocene Flora of G√ºvem village near Ankara, Turkey, Abstracts of the Papers Presented at the XII International Botanical Congress, Akademika Nauk SSSR, 1: 115, Leningrad See also * List of animal and plant symbols of the Canary Islands References indica Flora of the Canary Islands Flora of the Azores Flora of Madeira Flora of Macaronesia Trees of Mediterranean climate Conservation dependent plants Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Persea indica"},{"id":"12905606","text":"Persea julianae is a species of plant in the family Lauraceae.

In the Absolute, the setting's afterlife, a being called Modo endangered his companions in pursuit of power. The inhabitants of the Absolute called a tribunal and sentenced Modo to be reborn on earth, live a mortal life (retaining his memories but none of his power) and die after 100 years.

As the player character gains experience and levels, he or she improves basic attributes, skills in areas such as m√™l√©e combat, trading, and crafting, and prowess in the game's twelve schools of magic. Each school of magic consists of eight spells; as the player gains prowess in a school of magic, his or her body morphs to take on characteristics reminiscent of the school. Release history 1C Company released the single-player action role-playing game Blood Magic () in Russia on December 16, 2005. A stand-alone expansion pack, Blood Magic: Time of Shadows (), followed on November 24, 2006. The expansion featured a new story, upgraded interface, and multiplayer support via LAN or internet.

Reception Blood Magic won the Best Debut award at the Russian game developers conference KRI 2006. Dawn of Magic has a ranking of 52 on the review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings. GameSpot gave the game a score of 3 out of 10, criticizing its derivativeness, limited choices and numerous bugs. Martin Korda of IGN gave it 6.9 out of 10 and said that \\"despite its bold proclamations of reinventing the tried and tested Diablo template, Dawn of Magic remains an RPG with more than a whiff of the past hanging around it.\\" while Emily Balistrieri of the same site gave it 5.4 and criticized its multiplayer, which according to her, lacked variety. In 2011 the game came out for iPhone, but it too got mediocre review of 5 out of 10.
