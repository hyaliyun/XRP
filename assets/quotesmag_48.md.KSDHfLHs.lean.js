On March 1, 1954, Figueroa Cordero together with fellow Nationalists Lolita Lebrón, Irvin Flores, and Rafael Cancel Miranda entered the United States Capitol building armed with automatic pistols and fired 30 shots. Five congressmen were wounded, however all the representatives survived and Figueroa Cordero, along with the other three members of his group were immediately arrested. Early years Figueroa Cordero was born into a poor family in the Barrio Lagunas in the town of Aguada in Puerto Rico. He quit school at an early age and went to work. He wanted to help the economic situation of his family by contributing his personal income.\\"War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America’s Colony\\"; Author: Nelson Antonio Denis Puerto Rican Nationalist Party The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was founded by José Coll y Cuchí as a direct response to the American colonial government in 1919, By the 1920s, there were two other pro- independence organizations in the Island, they were the \\"Nationalist Youth\\" and the \\"'Independence Association of Puerto Rico\\". On September 17, 1922, the two political organizations merged into the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. In 1924, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and on May 11, 1930, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.Luis Muñoz Marín, By A. W. Maldonado, Pg. 86, Publisher: La Editorial, Universidad de Puerto Rico , (December 1, 2006) , , There were sub-groups within the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. The \\"Puerto Rican Youth for Independence\\" was one of them. Figueroa Cordero became a believer in the ideology which embraced Puerto Rican independence and joined the \\"Puerto Rican Youth for Independence\\" group. He later became a fully fledged member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party presided by Albizu Campos. New York City On July 2, 1948, Figueroa Cordero decided to move to New York City in search of a job. He did so because the economic situation of the island was in a bad state. Figueroa Cordero worked in a butcher shop, while at the same-time he continued to be a vocal advocate of the Puerto Rican independence cause. In New York he became a member of the Nationalist Party branch of that city. There he befriended Lolita Lebrón and Rafael Cancel Miranda. He later met and befriended Irvin Flores who had moved to New York and had become a member of the New York Nationalist Party branch. In 1954, Lebrón received a letter from Albizu Campos, in which he declared his intention to order attacks on \\"three locations, the most strategic to the enemy\\".Ribes Tovar et al., p.132 Albizu Campos wanted Lebrón to pick a group of nationalists for this task without her personal participation. Lebrón presented the plan to the Nationalist Party in New York and choose Cancel Miranda, Flores and Figueroa Cordero for the task. Lebrón decided to lead the group despite the fact that Albizu Campos did not want her to be an active participant. The pistols used in the attack were purchased by the Chicago Nationalist branch and sent to the New York branch. The New York branch not only provided the group with the weapons but, they also provided the funds for their railroad tickets. The date for the attack on the House of Representatives was to be March 1, 1954. This date was chosen because it coincided with the inauguration of the \\"Conferencia Interamericana\\" (Interamerican Conference) in Caracas. Lebrón intended to call attention to Puerto Rico's independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference.Los Angeles TimesNew York Times: Irvin Flores, 69, Dies; Wounded 5 in CongressWhite Star Assault on the House of Representatives Figueroa Cordero arrived with the group in Washington, D.C. and sat in the visitor's gallery in the House of Representatives. The representatives of the House were discussing Mexico's economy when suddenly Lebrón gave the order to the group to quickly recited the Lord's Prayer. She then stood up and shouted \\"¡Viva Puerto Rico Libre!\\" (\\"Long live a Free Puerto Rico!\\") and unfurled the flag of Puerto Rico. The group opened fire with semi- automatic pistols.Edward F. Ryan, The Washington Post, March 2, 1954, pp.1, 12-13. Even though some 30 shots were fired (mostly by Cancel, according to his account), wounding five lawmakers; one representative, Alvin Morell Bentley from Michigan, was seriously wounded in the chest, Figueroa Cordero was unable to fire his gun because it was jammed. Upon being arrested, Lebrón yelled \\"I did not come to kill anyone, I came to die for Puerto Rico!\\" Arrest and trial Lebrón, Cancel Miranda and Figueroa Cordero were immediately arrested. However, Flores walked away from the building in the confusion that followed. He took a taxi to a bus stop. There he was stopped and questioned together with various Mexicans who happened to be there, by the local police who had just heard about the shooting. They found a loose bullet in his pocket and arrested him. Figueroa Cordero and his comrades were charged with attempted murder and other crimes. The trial began on June 4, 1954, with judge Alexander Holtzoff presiding over the case, under strict security measures. A jury composed of seven men and five women was assembled, their identities were kept secret by the media. The prosecution was led by Leo A. Rover, as part of this process 33 witnesses testified.Ribes Tovar et al., p.178 Ruth Mary Reynolds, the \\"American/Puerto Rican Nationalist\\", with the aid of the American League for Puerto Rico's Independence, helped to defend the four Nationalists involved in the shooting incident On July 13, 1954, the four nationalists were taken to New York, where they declared themselves not guilty on the charges of \\"trying to overthrow the government of the United States\\".Ribes Tovar et al., p.197 On October 26, 1954, judge Lawrence E. Walsh found all of the accused guilty of conspiracy, sentencing them to six additional years in prison.Ribes Tovar et al., p.209 Imprisonment and release Figueroa Cordero was sent to the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia. While imprisoned he became sick and was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He was sent to the Federal Medical Center for Prisoners at Springfield, Missouri to receive medical treatment, but it was all in vain. In 1978, President Carter pardoned Figueroa Cordero's comrades Cancel Miranda, Lebrón and Flores after they had served 25 years in prison. The Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló publicly opposed the pardons granted by Carter, stating that it would encourage terrorism and undermine public safety. Figueroa Cordero's comrades received a hero's welcome by their supporters upon their return to Puerto Rico. The presidential clemency read as follows:Andres Figueroa Cordero Announcement of the Commutation of Mr. Figueroa Cordero's Prison Sentence. Later years After his release, Figueroa Cordero continued to serve as an independence advocate. He was also an active participant in the struggle for the prison release of his three comrades Lolita Lebrón, Rafael Cancel Miranda and Irvin Flores. In an interview, he made the following statement: \\"I would do it half a million times if had to. To save your country, there is no other recourse than to give your life.\\" The Order of Playa Girón On July 23, 1978, Figueroa Cordero traveled to Cuba to receive treatment for his illness in that country's Fajardo Hospital. During his stay in the hospital he was awarded the Pablo de la Torriente Brau Medal by the Cuban Communist YouthAndrés Figueroa Cordero, héroe de la Patria and was visited by Fidel Castro.Informacion al desnudeo Figueroa Cordero returned to his hometown in Puerto Rico where he died on March 7, 1979. He is buried in the Municipal Cemetery of Aguada. The local municipal government honored his memory with the unveiling of a bust in his likeness located in the carretera PR 416. In 1979, Figueroa Cordero was posthumously awarded the Order of Playa Girón.Order of Playa Girón The Order of Playa Girón is a national order conferred by the Council of State of Cuba on Cubans or foreigners for their leadership in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism and neo- colonialism, or who have contributed to peace and the progress of humankind.

Origin of uirō The origin of uirō in Odawara goes back to 14th-century China. Chin En-yū (陳延祐, Chen Yanyou in Mandarin Chinese), a medical doctor in Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, moved to Japan as the Yuan Dynasty was replaced by the Ming Dynasty. He arrived in Hakata, and practiced medicine, calling himself Chin Gairō (陳外郎, Chen Wailang), using the title of his Yuan Dynasty government. He was invited several times to Kyoto to serve Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, the shōgun, but he declined. He later became a Buddhist monk, assumed the name of Sokei (宗敬), and died in Hakata. History of Uirō (in Japanese) His son, Sōki (宗奇), moved to Kyoto, and was sent to his father's home town of Taizhou, China. He brought the recipe for Reihōtan medicine (霊宝丹), which was such an effective medicine for many diseases that it was given the name of \\"Tōchinkō\\" (透頂香) by the emperor because of its special fragrance. It was also called Uirō, an alternative of the Zhejiang pronunciation of \\"Wailang\\", the government title of his father. Sōki entertained foreign guests with special cakes, which were called \\"Uirō cakes\\". Jōyu, Sōki's son, was a man of high esteem. His son, Soden (祖田), was also so respected that Soden's eldest son, Sadaharu (定治), was given the family name of Uno (宇野) by shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa. Uno Sadaharu moved to Odawara in 1504 at the invitation of Hojo Soun and the descendants of Chin Gairō have made Uirō medicine there ever since. Recent research Uirō Family and Its Tōchinkō Medicine, a doctorate thesis by Shigeru SUGIYAMA (Pharmaceutical Department of Chiba University, 1996) (in Japanese) shows that Uirō medicine was available in both Kyoto and Odawara until the Genroku Period of the late 17th century. Uirō cakes became available in Odawara during the Meiji Period in the late 19th century. Later as per Japanesse newspaper Dr. Naturo relative of Sokei will practice Uirō for the Ming Dynasty. Medicine Uirō medicine comes in small silvery pills, much like Jintan pills. A typical package contains 428 pills in three plastic bags. It is considered a good remedy for stomachache, headache, giddiness, and other routine conditions. Its ingredients include ginseng, musk, borneol, and cinnamon bark. From the Uirō medicine package In Japanese Culture There are two famous mentions on Odawara's Uirō in the Japanese literature, Uirō Salesman in Kabuki \\"Uirō Salesman\\" () is one of the Eighteen Popular Kabuki Scenes. It is from the Soga Brothers' Revenge, and is one of the brothers' rapid sales talk about the Uirō medicine and its merits. Yaji and Kita's Stay at Odawara Station Jippensha Ikku wrote a famous, funny story of Yaji and Kita through the 53 stations of the old Tokaido Road, from Edo to Kyoto in Tōkaidōchū Hizakurige, published between 1802 and 1822. At Odawara Station, they buy Uirō, thinking it is a cake, but find it is medicine.

Expansion The UCP aspires for unity among socialist forces in Russia. In 2018 another left-wing Russian party, New Communist Movement, merged with the UCP. Criticism Political analysist Sean Guillory wrote about the radical Left in Russia on the eve of the Russian presidential election in May 2018. In this section of Russian politics he included a range of organisations, which included the United Communist Party. Guillory stated that he sees the radical Left in Russia (including the United Communist Party) as limited by a number of factors. These include state repression, ideological differences (particularly the Ukrainian question), a generational divide and a lack of money. Despite their aspiration to develop a parallel media that is representative of “the majority of the Russian population” the Russian left Guillory argues are “resource poor.” There is, according to Guillory a clear generational divide within the Russian Left that has a detrimental effect on the United Communist Party. Older parties such as the UCP identify with the Soviet Union with a membership and support base that “tends to be older, even elderly”. Newer groups don’t employ as much Soviet Union symbolism and have members and supporters who are younger. Young Russians who start to develop a class consciousness and interest in political affairs are attracted to the newer groups. Failure to attract younger members and supporters has a terminal effect. This further accelerates the decline of the older Russian left organisations.

Biography  Pietro De Cristofaro was born in Naples in 1900 and entered the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno on September 17, 1914. He graduated in 1919 with the rank of Ensign (during the First World War he was embarked on the cruiser Flavio Gioia, used as a training ship). He was promoted to Sub-Lieutenant on March 17, 1921 and to Lieutenant three years later. After a series of assignments on various ships, on August 27, 1927 he was seriously injured in a plane crash near Fiume, while he was serving as an observer on a Savoia-Marchetti S.59 bis seaplane of the 188th Maritime Reconnaissance Squadron. After recovering from his wounds, from March 1928 to April 1929 he commanded the Rome Detachment of the C.R.E.M. (Corpo Regi Equipaggi Marittimi, Royal Naval Crews Corps).Pietro De Cristofaro on the website of the Italian Navy. From April 1929 to February 1931 De Cristofaro was an aide to the Prince of Piedmont; on 1 December 1932 he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and given command of the destroyer Luca Tarigo and then of the torpedo boat Cortellazzo; he also served, for a short time, as executive officer on the destroyer Daniele Manin. He was assigned to the office of the Chief of Staff of the Navy from September 1935 to June 1, 1937, then he was sent to Tripoli and assigned to the High Command of the Armed Forces in North Africa. Back in Italy, he was executive officer of the light cruiser Duca degli Abruzzi and then, in September 1939, he was attached to the Command of the 5th Air Squadron. In November 1939 he was again given command of the destroyer Tarigo, of which he still was the commanding officer on June 10, 1940, when Italy entered World War II. In the first ten months of war, De Cristofaro with Tarigo carried out a number of convoy escort missions between Italy and Libya, as well as minelaying operations in the Strait of Sicily. On April 13, 1941, Tarigo, along with the destroyers Lampo and Baleno, sailed from Naples to escort a Tripoli-bound convoy composed of the steamers Arta, Adana, Aegina, Iserlohn and Sabaudia (all German, except for the latter) with troops and supplies for the Afrika Korps. De Cristofaro was the escort leader. In the early hours of April 16, off the Kerkennah, the convoy was attacked by four British destroyers, led by Captain Philip Mack.Tarigo ConvoyWorld War II: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document CollectionStruggle for the Middle Sea Lampo and Baleno, taken by surprise, were disabled before they could mount an effective reaction; Tarigo, left alone, confronted the British ships and tried in vain to defend the merchant ships, but was in turn wrecked by enemy fire, which also amputated one of De Cristofaro's legs. Although already in a sinking condition, Tarigo managed to score two torpedo hits on the British destroyer Mohawk, sinking her. Shortly thereafter, Tarigo went down with most of the crew, including De Cristofaro. He was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.

He is the creator and host of The Thinking Atheist online community, podcast, and YouTube channel, as well as the author of three self-published books. Prior to his atheist activism, he was a fundamentalist Christian and had a ten-year career as a Christian radio host.  Early life  Andrews was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, into a Christian family with parents who studied theology, and he was baptized at the Eastwood Baptist Church. When his public-school education conflicted with the religious teachings he had received at home, his parents transferred him to the small, church-owned Temple Christian School, and later to the Eastwood Baptist School. As a student leader, he eagerly participated in school functions and religious activities, including weekly church services, the student council, and the local branch of Youth for Christ, for which he was a spokesman.  Career as a radio host  Andrews was a fan of contemporary Christian music. He hosted the Morning Show on Christian radio station KXOJ-FM from 1990 to 2000. The 1997 death of Christian songwriter Rich Mullins in a traffic accident played a role in Andrews' initial doubts about the truth of Christianity. He later commented, \\"As I spoke words of comfort to our listeners and callers, I struggled to reconcile the notion that the God of Matthew 10, the one who considered us worth 'more than many sparrows,' would design or abide the taking of Mullins' earthly life in such a pointless, gruesome manner.\\" The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, also played a role in strengthening Andrews' doubts about religion and leading him to apostasy.  The Thinking Atheist  In 2004 Andrews saw the video of atheist Christopher Hitchens debating Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, which made him decide to leave his faith. In 2008, he finally told his family and friends he was an atheist. Finding no community of other atheists in his area, he decided to build an atheist community online. He created a website and Facebook page, both called The Thinking Atheist, to connect with other non-believers online and \\"share some of the information that I had found helpful in the hope of making the journey out of superstition (religion) easier for others\\". He considers the website to be a venue which allows people to engage their doubts and question their faith. Andrews is also the host of The Thinking Atheist weekly podcast, which aims to challenge stereotypes that depict atheists as angry, or religious people as stupid. In addition, he has a YouTube channel called The Thinking Atheist which hosts numerous self-produced atheist-related videos where he attempts to debunk the claims of Christians. He also engages in public speaking about atheism.  Books  San Jose  Deconverted  In December 2012, Andrews self-published his autobiographical book Deconverted: A Journey From Religion To Reason, detailing his journey out of religion and how he became an atheist activist. In addition to discussing his apostasy, he recounts his life growing up in the Bible Belt and his past as a DJ for a Christian radio station, and discusses how and why he created the Thinking Atheist community. Paleontologist Donald Prothero commented on the book as follows:  Sacred Cows  In June 2015, Andrews self-published his second book, Sacred Cows: A Lighthearted Look at Belief and Tradition Around the World. In it he identifies ideas, beliefs and traditions that various cultures regard as holy, stressing that ideas should be examined critically rather than being followed with blind faith. In a review for Skeptic magazine, Donald Prothero wrote,  Confessions of a Former Fox News Christian  Andrews published his third book in July 2020, detailing his prior idolization of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Ann Coulter, and Fox News. The book examines American conservative media that \\"constantly feed on (and feed into) public outrage, ignorance, bigotry, and fear.\\"  Recognition  * In 2012, The Thinking Atheist was voted the Favorite Agnostic/Atheist Website of 2012, winning the About.com Reader's Choice Award. * In 2013, Andrews received the Evolve Award For Excellence in a Podcast for The Thinking Atheist, with the comment that \\"Andrews tackles issues about the world, atheism, and religion while showing that a person can be an atheist without being a grouch.\\"  Views on religion  In 2014, Andrews told the Arizona Daily Sun, \\"I was a true believer, and when I hit the age of 37, my doubts about my faith came to critical mass and for the first time in my life, I began to examine what I had held as true.\\" About his recent activism he declared: \\"I'm not an enemy of religious people, but I'll be honest and say I am an enemy of religion.\\" When asked by AlterNet what his favorite Bible verse was, he replied that it was probably Romans 12:9, which reads 'Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.' He explained, \\"The message here isn't groundbreaking (and certainly doesn't require godlike powers to formulate), but I find it admirable: Don't be a fake. Pursue that which brings about a positive result, for yourself and for others. Hold evil in contempt. Of course, I don't bind a supernatural connotation to the word 'evil' but rather see evil as an action.\\" An Oklahoma news website asked Andrews about his opinion on Madalyn Murray O'Hair, the founder of American Atheists, who sued to end compulsory Bible reading in public schools in the 1960s. He replied, \\"I personally don't relate to her tactics, but while I myself may have a different style, I must give her credit. Madalyn was a such a champion for non-belief that she paid for it with her life. I have a tremendous amount of admiration (for her). She did a lot of good work.\\"  References   External links  * 1968 births American atheism activists American former Christians American male writers American men podcasters American podcasters American skeptics Living people Writers from Tulsa, Oklahoma ","title":"Seth Andrews"},{"id":"52929225","text":"Isaac Gubel (February 2, 1927 – March 21, 1983) was an Argentine psychiatrist and hypnotist.

It is described as the best surviving example of a plen-an-gwary, a medieval amphitheatre used for performing the Ordinalia, or Cornish miracle plays. Geography Perran Round () is on B3285 road between the mid-Cornwall villages of Goonhavern and Perranporth, in the parish of Perranzabuloe. The hamlets of Rose and Lower Rose are to the north-east and the round is surrounded by agricultural land. Between the round and the coast, to the north is the Penhale Sands, sand dune system with the buried remains of the 6th- century St Piran's Oratory () and a later church (now known as St Piran's Old Church, ). Both were abandoned by encroaching sand. History The origins of Perran Round are uncertain. It has been described as an Iron Age circular enclosure, or round and the citation under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 does describe Perran Round as a small enclosure of later Iron Age and early post-Roman period. A round consists of an embanked enclosure and is considered to be the Iron Age equivalent of a farming hamlet. Henry Jenner compiled the scheduling paperwork which states that it is ″more probable″ that it was constructed as a plain-an-gwary, an open-air theatre for the performance of miracle plays. There are three medieval mystery plays, the Ordinalia, written primarily in Middle Cornish and dating to the late fourteenth-century. Richard Carew in his Survey of Cornwall (1602) mentions ″Gwary miracles, kind of interlude, compiled in Cornish out of some scripture history.″ The round still contains a small trench, known as the ′Devil's Spoon′ for use in the performances. The earliest known plan, in William Borlase's Natural History of Cornwall shows two opposite entrances and the ″Devil's Spoon″, a hollow and trench on the eastern side of the arena. The plan also shows stepped terraces, presumely for seating which are no longer apparent. The present B3205 road is shown on the 1813 Ordnance Survey map along with a track which goes through the round. The 1840 tithe map shows that the road through the round was discontinued and a new roadway constructed more or less parallel with the B3205. From 1852 the Newlyn (east) Amphitheatre was enclosed and used by the Methodists. The pit could hold 1500 people and in 1880 was described as ″... kept exceeding neat and clean, having a small house inside its boundary, fitted up with every requisite for the preparation of those tea-meetings that have given it a name″. Anyone wishing to visit the round had to obtain the key from the minister or the chapel wardens. An 1880 edition of The Cornishman newspaper reported that before 1852 the round was said to be a quarry. Before the First World War the round was used by both the Liberal Party and the Tory Party for political rallies. Between the wars the round was neglected and used as a rubbish dump, and in the 1930s was cleared by the Perranzabuloe branch of the Council for the Preservation of Rural England (CPRE). By the Second World War it became a training ground for the Rose Platoon of the Home Guard with the tea room as the headquarters. After the war the Gorsedh Kernow (Cornish Gorseth) held its ceremony in the round on five occasions; 1946, 1958, 1970, 1985 and 1993 and it was once more used as a theatre. As part of the Festival of Britain in 1951 the miracle play Bewnans Meryasek (The Life of St Meriasek) was performed by Gwaroryon Gernewek. Later performances of other plays included Cornish Ordinalia, in 1969, by the Bristol University Players, Gwyrans an Bys (Creation of the World) in 1973 and in July 1996 an extract from the Ordinalia. Miracle Theatre, the Cornish-based theatre group first ever performance was in the round. ;Note Condition of the monument The diameter of the interior is about and the circular earth rampart is around high. The top of the rampart is flat and about wide. The ditch is continuous around the outside except for a causeway wide at the southern entrance. In the 1960s the round was once again neglected with the southern entrance waterlogged and the round covered in scrub. In 1967 Cornwall County Council raised the level of the forecourt and paved the entrance to improve drainage as well as some scrub clearing and reseeding. Following the management work, Perranzabuloe Parish Council leased the site and in 1884–85 there was further scrub clearance and the fence replaced. Rose Community Association and later Rose Men's Institute took over the management until 1995. The following year Cornwall Wildlife Trust undertook an ecological assessment and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers cleared scrub from the outer face of the banks and the ditch. The Cornwall Heritage Trust now had the lease but did not maintain the site and in 2002, English Heritage handed the site to the current leaseholders, St Piran's Trust.

Since 2006 she has been a professor of the Law Faculty at Leuven/Louvain University. She served, between 2009 and 2016, as chair of the sometimes troubled \\"Freiburg Sports Medicine Commission\\" at Freiburg University. Paoli holds dual German-Italian nationality and lives in Belgium. She has published extensively, notably on international drugs trading. Life Paoli was born and grew up in Prato, a commercially dynamic city a short distance to the north-west of Florence in Italy. From 1990 she studied Political Sciences at Florence University, later moving on to the European University Institute (also in Florence) where she received her doctorate in 1997 in return for a piece of work entitled \\"The Pledge to Secrecy: Culture, Structure and Action of Mafia Associations\\". Her dissertation, which earned her a coveted \\"summa cum laude\\" citation, was supervised by Prof. . She crossed the Alps and worked as an academic research assistant at the Tübingen University Institute for Criminology and at the Giessen University Institute for Sociology during 1996/97. From 1998 till 2006 she led a Research Group at the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law in Freiburg i.B.. In 2006 she switched to Leuven/Louvain University, half an hour to the east of Brussels, taking up a full professorship in Criminology. Freiburg Sports Medicine Commission At the end of 2009 Letizia Paoli was appointed to chair the independent expert commission of enquiry mandated to evaluate activities of the department of rehabilitative and sports medicine at the Freiburg University Medical Center. She took over the role from Dr. Hans Joachim Schäfer who had been obliged to resign for health reasons. Commentators have suggested that under her direction the commission faced obstructive actions from vested interests and that Letizia Paoli herself was subjected to aggressively hostile whispering attacks. Her own approach became more robust and uncompromising over time, but after more than seven years, by the start of 2017 it had become apparent that the commission had failed to conclude its task timely and satisfactorily. As commission chair, Paoli called upon Werner Franke to resign his membership of it, following leak allegations. However, in March 2015 a part-completed report on doping in the German football league was released by another commission member, Andreas Singler, indicating that the departure of Franke had not put an end to disagreements among its remaining members. One unexpected by-product of the commission's investigation involved Hans-Hermann Dickhuth whose 1983 habilitation (academic qualification) had been based on a dissertation that allegedly contained extensive word-for-word quotations from the doctoral dissertation of one of his own students. The potential news value of an otherwise mainstream plagiarism scandal was enhanced by the fact that the student in question subsequently became Dickhuth's wife. As commission chair, Paoli reported the commission's assessment of the matter to the university rectorate. The matter was then leaked to the press. Some felt that the university's handling of the affair lacked the necessary transparency, and in the very public disagreement between Paoli and the university authorities which ensued it was reported, towards the end of 2014, that she had threatened to resign the commission chairmanship. By this time publication of the commission's final report was believed to have been scheduled for Autumn/Fall 2015. However, Autumn/Fall 2015 came and went: in March 2016 the entire commission stepped down, amidst allegations that their work had been sabotaged, and with no sign of any final report.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. History In 1860, Mount Pleasant was founded as the county seat of Isabella County. It began as a tiny settlement, and the first store was not opened until 1864. However, it rapidly developed, and within a year had a church, a school, and a newspaper. Over the next ten years, a number of other commercial businesses were opened in what is now the downtown area. In 1875, the community incorporated as a village, and also suffered a devastating fire that destroyed almost the entire downtown. However, new buildings were quickly erected, with brick becoming the material of choice rather than frame construction. Another fire swept the village in 1882, prompting the construction of a fire station. By this time, the commercial district in the city had spread to encompass the block on Broadway between Court and Main (in the heart of current district) and along Main Street between Michigan and the courthouse to the north. Public utilities - water and electricity - were installed in the 1880s, and a number of churches were established. In the downtown area, the Bennett Hotel and Upton Opera House were constructed in the early 1880s. By 1884, there were 2000 residents in Mt. Pleasant, and in 1889 it was incorporated as a city. In 1891, a second hotel with 45 rooms was constructed. More significant commercial buildings were constructed in the downtown area into the 20th century, now almost exclusively of brick. After the turn of the century, the streetscape began to change, as concrete sidewalks and brick-paved streets were installed. Regular lightposts also appeared. When the Great Depression slowed the nation's economy, the economy of Mt. Pleasant was cushioned considerably due to the discovery of oil fields nearby. The oil boom brought an influx of money into the city in the 1930s, and the prosperity continued through the post-World War II period. In the 1950s, many of the older buildings in the district received mid-century facelifts. Through the rest of the century, the streets and streetscapes were altered, first by paving the streets in asphalt, and later by redirecting traffic flow and redesigning the sidewalk areas. Planters, benches, and historic light posts were also installed. Description The Mount Pleasant Downtown Historic District is centered on the intersection of Broadway and Main in Mount Pleasant, and encompasses the surrounding eight blocks. The district contains 70 buildings dating from the 1870s to the 1950s. The building are set close to each other and the sidewalk, and are primarily brick commercial structures of one or two stories (with a few three-story buildings). As buildings were demolished due to fire damage or other reasons, newer structures were built to replace them, resulting in a mingling of various styles throughout the district. Buildings are primarily Italianate and Commercial brick, with some other Late Victorian, Art Deco, and International Style structures mixed in. The earliest buildings in the district are Italianate structures constructed immediately after the 1875 fire. However, many of these which are still extant, such as the Doughty and Carr and Granger Blocks (100-108 East Broadway), and the Upton Opera House/Isabella County State Bank (200 East Broadway) have had their architectural features obscured by later additions or refurbishments of the facade. However, the oldest building in the district, the 1877 Fancher Block (101-103 E. Broadway) is still architecturally significant, as are the 1879 building at 130 S. Main and the stretch of buildings from 205 to 217 South Main. Other significant Late Victorian structures, built near the turn of the century, are the Chatterton Block at 118 East Broadway, the Thompson and Dusenbury blocks at 111-119 East Broadway, and the Foster Furniture Company at 102-106 South Main. These structures tend to be more Classical in detail, and include larger plate glass windows on the first floor. As the 1910s and 1920s approached, buildings were constructed more in the Commercial Brick style, and a number of buildings throughout the district are built in this style. Mt. Pleasant also has two significant Art Deco buildings, both of which are theaters: the 1920 Broadway Theater on East Broadway, which features a 1930s era projecting Art Deco marquee, and the 1937 Ward Theater on South Main, with a porcelain enamel façade finished in an Art Deco theme.

The Knights Hospitaller, led by Grand Master Foulques de Villaret, landed on the island in summer 1306 and quickly conquered most of it except for the city of Rhodes, which remained in Byzantine hands. Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos sent reinforcements, which allowed the city to repel the initial Hospitaller attacks, and persevere until it was captured on 15 August 1310. The Hospitallers transferred their base to the island, which became the centre of their activities until it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1522. Sources The conquest of Rhodes by the Knights Hospitaller is narrated by a large number of sources of varying detail and reliability. The most reliable sources include the contemporary Byzantine historian George Pachymeres, whose History only extends to 1307, and the various biographies of Pope Clement V (r. 1305–1314), which offer different details, but do not contradict each other, and are generally reliable. These are complemented by a number of papal ordinances and correspondence in the archives of the Holy See and the Crown of Aragon, as well as the 14th-century French chronicle of Gérard de Monréal (or Chronicle of the Templar of Tyre), and the 16th-century Italian chronicles of Francesco Amadi and Florio Bustron. These are chiefly concerned with the affairs of Cyprus and the troubled relationship between the Hospitallers and the Lusignan kings of the island, and are not very reliable as histories, containing much popular tradition and anecdotal or legendary information. Background Founded in Jerusalem in 1070, the Order of the Hospital became one of the most important military orders, with a significant presence not only in the Crusader states of the Levant, but also controlling large properties in Western Europe. Following the Fall of Acre in 1291, the Order had moved its base to Limassol in Cyprus. Their position in Cyprus was precarious; their limited income made them dependent on donations from Western Europe and involved them in quarrels with King Henry II of Cyprus, while the loss of Acre and the Holy Land led to widespread questioning on the purpose of the monastic orders, and proposals to confiscate their possessions. According to Gérard de Monréal, as soon as he was elected as Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in 1305, Foulques de Villaret planned the conquest of Rhodes, which would ensure him a liberty of action that he could not have as long as the Order remained on Cyprus, and would provide a new base for war against the Turks. Rhodes was an attractive target: a fertile island, it was strategically located off the southwestern coast of Asia Minor, astride the trade routes to either Constantinople or Alexandria and the Levant. The island was a Byzantine possession, but the increasingly feeble Empire was evidently unable to protect its insular possessions, as demonstrated by the seizure of Chios in 1304 by the Genoese Benedetto Zaccaria, who secured recognition of his possession from Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328), and the competing activities of the Genoese and Venetians in the area of the Dodecanese. Indeed, Rhodes itself was often given as a fief by the Byzantine emperors to their admirals of Genoese origin. Thus the Genoese Vignolo de' Vignoli claimed possession of the islands of Kos and Leros, and the estate of Lardos on Rhodes, as imperial fiefs. Already in 1299, the Pope proposed that Frederick III of Sicily capture the island, and his half-brother Sancho, a Hospitaller knight, led an unsuccessful expedition in Greek waters in 1305 aiming to capture some Byzantine islands. In the same year, the scholar Raymond Lull identified Rhodes as a suitable base for naval operations to prevent Christians from trading with the Muslims, and advocated its capture as part of Charles of Valois' plans for a new Crusade in the East. At the same time, the Venetians seized a number of islands in the area, such as Karpathos, jeopardizing Genoese influence. The Cypriot chronicles indicate that Foulques de Villaret entered into a contract with a Genoese, named as Boniface di Grimaldi by Gérard de Monréal and Vignolo de' Vignoli by the two Italian chronicles. The latter are probably correct, since a document survives, dated 27 May 1306, concluded between Villaret and other representatives of the Order and Vignolo. The latter thereby ceded his rights on Kos and Leros to the Hospitallers, with the right of retaining Lardos and one more estate of his own choice on Rhodes. In the other islands near Rhodes they would conquer, Vignolo would enjoy extensive rights as \\"vicarius seu justiciarius\\", albeit the Knights themselves and their servants would be under the direct jurisdiction of the Grand Master. Vignolo and the Knights would jointly appoint the tax collectors for the islands other than Rhodes, and would divide their income, with two thirds going to the Order and one third to Vignolo. Pope Clement V was most likely kept in the dark about the Hospitallers' designs on Rhodes, as no mention of it is made in the contemporary correspondence between the Pope and Villaret. Conquest of the island The Castle of Feraklos in 2016 On 23 June, Villaret and Vignolo sailed from Limassol, with two war galleys and four other vessels, carrying a force of 35 Knights, 6 Levantine horsemen, and 500 foot soldiers. To them were added some Genoese ships. The expedition first put in at Kastellorizo, whence Vignolo went ahead to reconnoitre Rhodes. The locals were warned, however, by a Greek serving the Order, and Vignolo barely escaped and made it back to rendezvous with Villaret. In the meantime, two Knights with fifty men had captured the castle of Kos, but were evicted again by Byzantine reinforcements. The allies then sailed to Rhodes. The chronicles of Amadi and Bustron provide the most detailed account of subsequent events: a first assault on the city of Rhodes by land and sea failed, but on 20 September, the Hospitallers captured the (probably deserted) Feraklos Castle on the island's eastern coast. Five days later they launched another unsuccessful attack on the city, which resisted until November. On 11 November, they took the citadel of Filerimos (ancient Ialysos) through the treason of a local Greek; the garrison of 300 Turks was massacred. This success encouraged the Knights to resume the siege of the capital, but the locals defended it with success, and asked for reinforcements from Emperor Andronikos II. In a letter of 30 April 1307, preserved in the royal archives of Aragon, some details are given: the Emperor sent eight galleys to aid the city, and the Hospitallers were forced to lift the siege after killing 80 Greeks and losing about a dozen of their own and about 40 horses. At about the same time, in March or April 1307, according to Pachymeres, the Hospitallers sent envoys to the Emperor, demanding that he hand over the city of Rhodes to them, so that they would make it their base in their war against the Turks. The Knights promised to recognise the suzerainty of the emperor and send him 300 of their best warriors whenever he demanded, but Andronikos II rejected their proposal, and began preparing further reinforcements to Rhodes to repel any attempt to capture it. In spring 1307, Pope Clement V invited Villaret to visit the Papal court at Poitiers, but the latter was delayed until August due to the ongoing conquest of Rhodes, which he was leading in person. The fact that Villaret felt able to leave the island in summer points to the conclusion that by that time, most of it, apart from the capital was in Hospitaller hands. On 5 September 1307, the Pope issued an act confirming the Hospitallers' possession of the island of Rhodes. However, a document from the Aragonese archives, dated to October 1307, indicates that while Lindos was in Hospitaller hands, the city of Rhodes was guarded by \\"twenty vessels of the emperor of Constantinople\\", and a letter by King James II of Aragon confirms that in March 1309, the Hospitallers still did not control the entire island. Villaret continued his close relations with the Genoese, who were not only expert sailors and shipbuilders, but also familiar with the Aegean and, just like the Hospitallers, rivals to the Venetians; thus in 1308–1309 Villaret placed contracts for twelve galleys and a navis magna in Genoese shipyards. Villaret remained in the West for two years, but by September 1309 he was seeking permission to return to the East to oversee the completion of the conquest. He left Genoa for Naples in November, and arrived at Brindisi in January 1310. There, the Hospitallers refused to ship any member of the massive, disorderly mob constituting the Crusade of the Poor, who all desired to take part in an unauthorised crusade to the Holy Land. Villaret's fleet reportedly numbered 26 galleys, including Genoese ships, carrying a force of 200–300 Knights and 3,000 foot soldiers, but the bad weather delayed their departure until spring. The ostensible aim of this expedition was to assist Cyprus and the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, but Villaret, again most likely without the knowledge of the Pope, used it to finish his conquest of Rhodes. The city of Rhodes was finally captured on 15 August 1310, according to both the biographies of Clement V and the reports of Christopher of Cyprus. The latter reports that the Hospitallers had amassed 35 galleys for the operation. According to the three Cypriot chronicles, however, the city was not captured by force, but through a stroke of luck: a Genoese ship sent by the Emperor with victuals for the besieged garrison was blown off course to Famagusta on Cyprus. The ship captain was captured by a Cypriot knight, Peter the Younger (Pierre le Jaune, Piero il Giovene), who brought him to Rhodes before the Grand Master. To escape execution, the ship captain convinced the garrison to surrender on the condition that their lives and property would be spared. Dating controversy The chronology of the conquest was for long accepted to have been in two stages, with the first landing and conquest of the island in 1306 and the final capture of the city of Rhodes in 1310. However, the French scholar Joseph Delaville Le Roulx, in his magisterial Cartulaire général de l'Ordre des Hospitaliers de Saint-Jean de Jérusalem (1100-1310), relying on the account of Pachymeres (which he places in April 1308) and the reports of a two-year siege in the Cypriot chronicles, concluded that the date of the capture of the city of Rhodes was 15 August 1308, a date which was then used by the majority of scholars dealing with the Crusades and the Knights Hospitaller. The confusion of the various dates given by the chroniclers has resulted in several proposals on when the capital of Rhodes surrendered: although the date of 15 August, as a major religious festival, seems secure, the year this took place has varied, with every year from 1306 to 1310 having been suggested by modern scholars. Aftermath Following the completion of the conquest, the Hospitallers moved their convent and hospital from Cyprus to Rhodes. Efforts were made to attract Latin settlers, both to replenish the local population that had dwindled to some 10,000, and to provide men for military service. The Order lost no time in beginning military operations in the area: enforcing a papal ban on trade with Mamluk Egypt, the Knights did not hesitate to capture even Genoese vessels, although the Genoese had aided the conquest. A brief alliance of the Genoese with the emirate of Menteshe followed, but the Hospitallers scored a significant victory over the latter in 1312. Tensions rose with Venice at the same time, as the Hospitallers seized Karpathos and other Venetian-controlled islands. Eventually, the Hospitallers reached an agreement with both Italian maritime powers, and the seized islands were returned to Venice in 1316. The grand preceptor Albert of Schwarzburg led the Hospitaller navy to victories against the Turks in 1318, and at the Battle of Chios in 1319, after which he recaptured the island of Leros, whose Greek populace had rebelled and restored Byzantine rule. In the next year, he defeated a Turkish fleet of eighty vessels, preventing an invasion of Rhodes. With this success, Hospitaller control of the island was secured for the next century.

He was also known by his nickname Fritz Westphal.  Life  Thorvaldsen's Return to Copenhagen by Westphal. From 1821 to 1826 he studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen alongside Carl Andreas August Goos, Hermann Wilhelm Bissen, Harro Harring and the Norwegian landscape painter Thomas Fearnley. In 1823 he took Fearnley on a hike through Schleswig-Holstein. In 1827 he returned to his birthplace and produced a lithograph of J. F. Fritz's 'Four Seasons' sequence in Flensburg. In 1828 he studied in Munich and from May 1829 alongside Fearnley in Dresden, where he befriended the genre painter Joseph Petzl – both Westphal and Petzl recorded their artistic, romantic and everyday lives in diary-like drawings. Petzl was a major influence on Westphal, who began painting small genre works in the Biedermeier style, sometimes reflecting recent historical events such as the Tyrolese struggle against the Austrian Empire and the Greeks suffering from cholera epidemics. He also painted scenes from Danish contemporary history, such as Bertel Thorvaldsen's return to Copenhagen (1838), Frederick VI's funeral procession (1840) and the anointing of Christian VIII (1840). Aftershocks of the 1830 French July Revolution in the Kingdom of Saxony caused both Petzl and Westphal to move to Schleswig. In summer 1832 Westphal went on a hike through Norway and from 1837 onwards he began to produce illustrations for books by the Danish writers Christian Winther, Heinrich Hertz and Carsten Hauch. Hoping to travel to Italy, Westphal returned to Copenhagen to compete for the Academy's Great Gold Medal, whose prize was a scholarship to go to Rome, but lost the 1837, 1839 and 1841 competitions for it. He then became a \\"costumier\\" at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen. After his death his sister Sophie tried to keep his memory alive by publishing \\"Genre-Bilder in Bildern und Tönen von Fritz Westphal\\" in 1852 – it contained 32 of his poems and 10 of his lithographs.

Isgård lies 10 kilometers from the city Århus in a straight line across Århus Bugt, but 47 kilometers by road around the bay.Krak.dk As of 2011 Isgård includes 263 hectares of land. There are modern pig farm buildings with a registered production capacity of 12.000 piglets weighing 7 to 30 kilos per year.Landbrugsmæglerne.dk These buildings are located out of sight of the main buildings, but are visible from the southern sea front in Begtrup Vig. The oldest of Isgård's buildings are about 300 years old dating back to the 1700s.Historian Vilfred Friborg Hansen, Friborg.dk Isgård viewed from Begtrup Vig (Begtrup Bay) with newer farm buildings specialized for breeding piglets in the foreground View from the hills above Isgård over Århus Bay towards the west in direction of mainland Jutland and the southern outskirts of Århus The small public country road leading to Isgård, Isgårdsvej, runs through the main yard continuing under a narrow archway through one of the old farm buildings, turning up a hill as an unpaved road to Landborup. Here the road passes a viewpoint 80 meters above sea level. From this spot there is a view of many of southern Djursland's bays, as well as 10 kilometers across Århus Bugt to mainland Jutland with the seaport of Århus clearly seen. Århus is Denmark's second largest city lying south of the peninsula, Djursland, where Isgård is located on the southern part. The public road to Isgård goes through the main yard continuing through one of the farm buildings via an archway. Steep slopes with coastal erosion by Isgård. For scale click the picture to see the people on the beach on the right side. Owners In the Middle Ages Isgård was called Eg (Oak). A nearby village still bears this name today. Isgård has been owned by bishop Skjalm Vognsen, who was one of the builders of Århus Cathedral in the 1100s and 1200s. From the hills up from Isgård, the cathedral in Århus, with its 96 meter high tower, could clearly be seen in olden days. Today the built up harbor area partly obscures the view to the cathedral. When the Reformation came to Denmark around 1536, with the shift from Catholicism to Protestant Lutheranism, church belongings were confiscated by the king, including Isgård, that was part of Århus Cathedral's estate. Eight years later, in 1544, the king sold Isgård to a neighboring squire in the area, High Court judge, Anders Christiernsen Sandberg of Quelstrup. In the early 1600s Isgård-owner Joachim Gersdorff bought three other estates around Århus Bugt including Rolsøgård, Vosnæsgård and Quelstrup. In the late 1700s this conglomerate was split up again. Through the 1800s Isgård often changed owners. In 1890 the existing main building was built by court squire Just Henrik Krieger, and his wife, baroness Ellen Gyldenstjerne. As of June 2016 Isgård is owned by Ole Danmark Knudsen.Landbrugsavisen.dk Surroundings The coastline of Isgård to the south and the east consists of steep, often eroding, slopes down to the sea with a walkable beach, where the tidal difference is normally less than one foot.Molsportalen.dk The hilly moraine deposits in the area are dominated by different types of clay with spots of sandy material in between. Isgård's 3 kilometers of rarely visited scenic coastline is described as good for angling on various anglers' websites. Fish caught here include sea trout and flounders, plus, more seasonally, garfish and mackerel.VisitDjursland.com It takes some local knowledge to get down to this coast as an angler or hiker. One way is from Isgårdsvej east of Isgård between Isgård and the village Eg, turning south down an easily overlooked, unpaved forest road recognizable by a small information poster at the roadside. This leads to a public footpath going to the sea. All in all it is about one kilometer from Isgårdsvej. Via the path one can walk along the shoreline round Mols Hoved (Mols Head) including along Isgård',s coastline towards the summer house settlement, Skødshoved Strand, and Hundshoved. In Denmark access to all coastlines is public, secured by law. From Skødshoved Strand there is also access to the coastline from the northwest. The walk between Skødshoved Strand around Mols Hoved along the coast is about 6 kilometers. One can also walk part of the way along the fields at the top of the coastal slopes giving a better view, but with problems as to going down the steep slopes, if one wants to walk along the shore part of the way. From Isgård, one kilometer to the west, at the end of the partly gravel road, Molshovedvej, lies a minor summer house settlement in the hills next to Århus Bugt and close to the steep and largely impassable slope down to the sea. In this summer house area there is a stairway down the slope to the sea. Nonresident driving is prohibited on Molshovedvej as a way of access to the sea, but one is allowed to walk or ride a bike on the road. This is another way to reach the coastline down from Isgård. 823 hectares in the proximity of Isgård were protected in 1982, with the purpose of securing the nature assets of the hilly landscape and securing better public access to the area and the sea.About protected areas, at fredninger.dk References   External links  Houses completed in 1700 Tourist attractions in Denmark Listed buildings and structures in Syddjurs Municipality Tourist attractions in the Central Denmark Region ","title":"Isgård"},{"id":"52930063","text":"Amanbek Manybekov (Russian: Аманбек Маныбеков, born 6 August 1995) is a footballer from Kyrgyzstan.

The range includes traditional painting and printmaking papers, and inkjet papers.  History  Production of paper on the St Cuthberts Mill site began in 1736, producing hand made paper under the name Lower Wookey Mill. Lower Wookey Mill was leased by Joseph Coles (aka Joseph Coles Sprague) in 1786. The Coles family were active in the Axe Valley for around a century. Joseph Coles first recorded his watermarks in 1797/9. A Hollander beater ‘beating machine’ was installed to increase production. In 1856 Edward Burgess and Ward bought the mill and installed two Fourdrinier machines, which were powered by a new water wheel designed by Henry Coles of Henley Mill. St Cuthberts Mill Paperworks, circa 1889 -1897. (MIll 364) 1876\\\\. A new partnership resulted in the mill increasing its production. The Mill had esparto and rag preparation capabilities, dusters, nine boilers for grass and rags, four potchers, fifteen beaters, chemical processing plant, gas works, two machines, mechanics shop, and offices on site. All of this was powered by a water wheel and eleven steam engines. The 'Maintenance Team' circa 1920. (MIll 364) The name of the mill was changed in 1862 to 'Mendip Mill'. In 1886 major changes resulted in the mill’s name to be changed again, this time to ‘St Cuthberts Mill’. Following these changes new effluent equipment and increased power was introduced to the mill. In 1897, the landmark chimney was built using 300,000 specially made bricks.Mill 364 - A brief resume - British Association of Paper Historians, 1999 conference. P.3 In 1907, No 2 Fourdrinier machine was installed. It is the same one still in use now, as it was rebuilt as a mould machine. Working in the 'Salle', 1921. (Mill 364). Burgess and Co's Mendip Mill circa 1935 The company Inveresk purchased St Cuthberts Mill in 1938, and took over the nearby Wookey Hole Mill. This led to Inveresk gaining experience in running a mould machine, and they began making artist papers with the purchase of the TH Saunders business in 1959. PM 1 machine installed in 1954. Wookey Hole purchased the rights to produce TH Saunders paper (Thomas Harry Saunders) (originally developed in 1920.) Those rights came to St Cuthberts Mill in 1959, with TH Saunders rebranded as Saunders Waterford in the 1980s. The Wookey Hole mould machine was transferred to the St Cuthberts Mill site after the sale of Wookey Hole Mill in 1972. Hand made paper continued at St Cuthberts Mill into 1976. Bockingford rights were bought from Whatman in 1975. Somerset paper was developed in the mid 1970s at St Cuthberts Mill. Michael Ginsburg, an American paper dealer (Legion Paper), is credited with giving the paper its name. It struck him as he was driving to the mill and came to the sign marking the Somerset border. 1984 saw an increase in demand for watercolour paper. After a rebuild, the mill turned to using the PM2 machine purely for the production of these papers. \\"In 1990, Somerset paper was chosen for a fund-raising lithograph, based on watercolour paintings created by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales. The lithographs were produced on a 300gsm (140lb) paper grade, which incorporated not only the Somerset watermark, but the Prince of Wales’s own crest too.\\" Improvements were made in 1991 to the PM1 machine, which was specialising in the creation of pre-impregnated papers for the cabinet market. In early 2010, the PM 1 machine was sold. Following this, in October 2010, St Cuthberts Mill Ltd was created following the fall of Inveresk, resulting in the mill specialising in artist’s papers, being produced on the remaining mould machine PM2. The mill was sold to F.I.L.A. in September 2016.

Goos Joseph Petzl (23 December 1803, Munich – 23 April 1871, Munich) was a German genre painter of the Biedermeier school. He has left a collection of drawings documenting his everyday life, love affairs and travels, now in the Münchner Stadtmuseum. Life From May 1821 he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich under Robert Langer. In 1828 he left the academy and began to travel widely, initially going to the \\"Dürerfest\\" celebrating Albrecht Dürer in Nuremberg. He stayed a year in Berlin, studying under Carl Begas, then from November 1829 lived in Dresden, where he became friends with the Norwegian landscape painter Thomas Fearnley and the Danish-German genre painter Friedrich Bernhard Westphal. In November 1830 he and Westphal travelled to the latter's birthplace of Schleswig, and in July the following year Petzl travelled to Copenhagen. He called at Kiel, Schleswig again and Düsseldorf, finally arriving back in Munich in September 1831. There he renewed his friendship with Fearnley, who had arrived in Munich a year earlier. In September 1832 Petzl, Fearnley and the Danish genre painter Vilhelm Bendz set off for Rome. The journey over the Alps was so exhausting that Bendz died in Vicenza, but Petzl and Fearnley reached Rome in November 1832. Petzl only stayed there briefly and joined Peter von Hess and a group of other Bavarian painters on a trip to Naples and Greece, reaching Naples on 30 January 1833, in time to witness celebrations for the arrival of king Otto of Greece. There he taught drawing to the daughters of Otto's minister Joseph Ludwig von Armansperg before travelling in 1834 to Istanbul. In November 1834 Petzl returned to Munich and shifted from his earlier scenes of Alpine and Tyrolese bandits, hunters, freedom fighters and peasant weddings to similar folkloric paintings of scenes in the Ottoman Empire.

He is currently working for Oriental Wrestling Entertainment (OWE). Professional wrestling career Dragon Gate =Early career and Millenials (2014-2015)= Hayashi debuted on April 4, 2014, losing to Shachihoko Boy in a dark match. On April 13, during a match against Eita, Hayashi suffered a broken jaw, derailing his early career and leaving him out of action for several months. After his return, Hayashi lost the majority of matches he competed in during his early career, common for young wrestlers in Japan. On January 16, 2015, he competed in his last match under his birth name, teaming with Super Shisa and Kotoka in a loss to the Jimmyz (Jimmy Kagetora, Genki Horiguchi H.A.Gee.Mee!! and Ryo Jimmy Saito). Two days later on January 18, Hayashi debuted a new ring name, competing as El Lindaman (inspired by the song “Linda, Linda” by The Blue Hearts). He initially wanted to join Osaka06 alongside Cima and Gamma, but after Cima joined Mad Blankey, Hayashi instead chose to join the Millennials, changing his attire to match the Millennial colour scheme and dyeing his hair pink. In his first match as Lindaman, he and Kotoka lost to Jimmy Kanda and Jimmy Susumu. =Over Generation (2015-2016)= On October 8, 2015, Lindaman joined Cima's new Over Generation stable alongside Eita, Gamma, Punch Tominaga, Kaito Ishida and Takehiro Yamamura. After joining the Over Generation, Lindaman again changed his attire. In November, Lindaman competed in the Open The Triangle Gate Tournament, teaming with Eita and Punch Tominaga. The trio were eliminated in the first round by VerserK (Yamato, Shingo Takagi and Naruki Doi). Lindaman competed in the 2016 King Of Gate tournament, finishing last in his block with one point. In 2016, he began teaming with Yosuke Santa Maria, with the duo beginning a kayfabe romance angle after Lindaman said that he liked her and wanted \\"to fight with and protect her\\". The duo were officially named The Marilyns, and shortly after aligning himself with Maria, Lindaman left the Over Generation and asked to join Maria's Tribe Vanguard stable, led by Yamato. Yamato said that Lindaman joining the stable or not was dependent on his performance alongside Santa Maria in the 2016 Summer Adventure Tag League. Lindaman and Santa Maria entered the 2016 Summer Adventure Tag League, tying for last in their block with just two points, leading Yamato to declare that Lindaman would not be joining Tribe Vanguard. After Yamato denied his request, Santa Maria slapped Lindaman, officially breaking up The Marilyns. =Heel turn and VerserK (2016-2018)= Shortly after, Lindaman adopted a new character, attacking his opponents and partners before and after matches and showing signs of a heel turn. Lindaman challenged Eita to a match for the Open the Brave Gate Championship, however, Punch Tominaga came down to the ring and entered himself into the title picture, leading to a number one contenders match on September 29, won by Lindaman. After the match, he officially turned heel, attacking Tominaga and accepting VerserK's offer to join their stable. Lindaman again changed his look, dying his hair red, changing his ring attire to fit with VerserK's colours and carrying a large rope around his neck. Representing VerserK, Lindaman unsuccessfully challenged Eita for the championship on October 12. On December 25 at Final Gate, Lindaman teamed with fellow VerserK members Cyber Kong and Mondai Ryu, facing Ben-K, Kotoka and Masato Yoshino and the Jimmyz (Jimmy Kanda, Jimmy Susumu and Ryo Jimmy Saito) in a triple threat match for the vacant Open the Triangle Gate Championship, won by the Jimmyz. On January 18, Lindaman teamed with VerserK leader Shingo Takagi and T-Hawk to win the One Night 6 Man Tag Tournament. On July 1, Lindaman along with Shingo Takagi and Takashi Yoshida defeated MaxiMuM for the Open the Triangle Gate Championship, winning El Lindaman's first championship in Dragon Gate.  Oriental Wrestling Entertainment  In early 2018, Cima announced his departure from Dragon Gate after 21 years working for the promotion, and also announced the formation of a new promotion, Oriental Wrestling Entertainment (OWE), to be primarily based in China. Aside from Cima; T-Hawk, El Lindaman, and Takehiro Yamamura also left Dragon Gate to join OWE. OWE's inaugural event was held on May 7. On June 22, representing OWE, Lindaman debuted in Wrestle-1. The rest of the OWE roster soon debuted in the promotion too, and named themselves \\"Strong Hearts\\", later recruiting Dezmond Xavier and Zachary Wentz to the group. Strong Hearts also debuted for DDT Pro Wrestling in September, defeating All Out (Konosuke Takeshita, Akito, Shunma Katsumata and Yuki Iino.

The reliquary is made of gold-plated silver and enamel and is c.139 cm high. The reliquary was recently transferred to the cathedral museum from the cathedral itself where it had been from the time of its creation.  Description  The reliquary of the Santo Corporale is considered to be one of the most important 14th century metal works from Siena. It is a gothic miniature inspired by northern European models showing the facade of the Orvieto Cathedral. The reliquary contains three vertical sections like the cathedral facade, but its typanum are much more acute. In addition, it contains a series of pinnacles surmounted by golden statues; this indicates a northern European influence as these details are generally not part of Italian architecture. Such influences from north of the Alps can frequently be seen in Italian gold and silver work of this era. Additional statues can be found at the base of the reliquary and on top is a jeweled cross. The reliquary is considered to be important artistically also because it contains the earliest extant painted translucent enamels. Thirty-two scenes in painted enamels represent the Stories of the Corporal and the Passion of Christ, created with a very contemporary style. Elaborate architectural sections, moving gothic lines, and great attention to fine detail show a strong affinity to panel painting of the era, including to artists like Simone Martini as well as the contemporary artists Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. With a taste even more markedly gothic it is a fundamental example of pictorial art of the Sienese school. Blue is the dominant background color from which stand out points of brilliant yellow, green, and red which render the scenes perfectly legibile. The reliquary was created to house a linen liturigcal cloth, a corporal, onto which appeared the blood of Christ from a consecrated host, and it was designed to house also the host itself. This event is reported to have occurred during a Mass celebrated in Bolsena by a skeptical Bohemian priest in late 1263 or 1264.

These regulations implement Title V of the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). The original regulations had been issued in 1979 and were updated in 1983. Litigation over mountaintop removal mining required changes to the regulations, which were issued in 2008. These regulations were in turn struck down by a judge after litigation by environmental groups. The new regulations, the Stream Protection Rule, were issued in January 2017. They were a topic in the 2016 elections, with Republican candidates for federal office saying that they would strike the regulations down if they would be elected. In February 2017, the Republican- controlled Congress, through the Congressional Review Act, passed a bill (a \\"resolution of disapproval\\") to revoke the rule. President Donald Trump signed the legislation, repealing the rule.Greg Jordan, [Trump signs bill repealing Obama-era Stream Protection Rule], Bluefield Daily Telegraph (February 17, 2017). This left the status of regulations implementing the SMCRA unclear.  History  The Stream Protection Rule updated the regulations issued by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) to implement Title V of the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), the focus of which were the conditions for issuing permits to begin a mining operation. The regulations had been issued in 1979, updated in 1983, and litigation over mountaintop removal mining required changes to the regulations, which were issued in 2008. Environmental groups challenged the new rules in court and in 2014 a federal court struck them down, and the Obama administration began working on new rules. In a joint hearing in December 2015, by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and Subcommittee on the Interior, U.S. Representative Brenda Lawrence stated in the reasoning to the Stream Protection Rule that previous rules were not developed with current science and have failed to prevent environmental harm.Examining the Stream Protection Rule United States. Congress. House. Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Subcommittee on the Interior. December 8, 2015 Current evidence has linked coal mining with loss in stream water quality and ecosystem health.\\"Study: Coal Mining Reduces Abundance, Richness of Aquatic Life\\". News. 2018-04-18. Retrieved 2019-04-10. State regulatory agencies have rarely enacted policy to regulate impact on streams outside of mining sites.Mayes, Morgan (2018). \\"GOODBYE, STREAM PROTECTION RULE: THE CHOICE BETWEEN PROTECTING THE COAL INDUSTRY OR NATURAL RESOURCES\\". Wake Forest Law Review. 53: 767–786. In July 2015 as part of the development of the new rules, OSMRE published a draft Environmental Impact Statement about the new rules. Pursuant to Executive Order 12898 issued by Bill Clinton, which required federal agencies to take environmental justice (EJ) concerns into consideration when taking regulatory and other actions, and pursuant to the EPA's own guidelines for implementing that order finalized in 1998, the impact statement had a section addressing EJ concerns. The EPA studied the demographics of 286 coal-producing counties and identified 44 that had significant minority or low-income populations; half of those were in Appalachia. The statement predicted that the rules would probably lead to a decrease in coal production, which would lead to a loss of jobs and with respect to minority-owned coal producers (e.g. Native American tribes) this would be a negative socio-economic effect. The Statement also offered predictions on the likely effects on public health and safety; biological resources, water resources, and air quality; topography and land use; and recreation in minority and low-income counties, and found that there were likely to be negligible to very beneficial effects in each of those aspects. The statement also addressed protections for cemeteries and sacred lands on tribal lands. The revised rules, which became known as the Stream Protection Rule, were published on December 20, 2016 by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, of the United States Department of the Interior. and became effective on January 19, 2017. Part of the work that led to the new rules was a collaboration with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service; the ESA requires federal agencies to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species, or adversely modify critical habitat. The Fish and Wildlife Service published its Programmatic Biological Opinion, and both agencies published a Memorandum of Understanding that described how OSMRE was implementing the findings of the Opinion, on the same day the new rules were published.  Provisions  Following the law it implemented, the Stream Protection Rule aimed to create \\"balance between environmental protection and the nation's need for coal as a source of energy.\\" To achieve this, the rule included improvements in the protection of water supplies, water quality, streams, fish and other wildlife, and other environmental issues that are harmed by surface coal mining; furthermore, the rule provided mine operators with more regulations that would help avoid water pollution as well as water treatment costs. In addition to these guidelines, the rule also included eradicating water pollution outside of permit areas, requiring thorough data collection for mining operations, protection and restoration of streams, updated guidelines for protecting endangered species, and long-term treatment of unintentional water contamination. Expanding on permits, the rule also guarantees that science and technology are leveraged to analyze the potential harms of mining. It also ensured that lands that are harmed by mining operations can be restored to a condition comparable to its condition before the mining operation was introduced. During the restoration process companies would be required to plant native trees and vegetation. 30% of the rule's provisions were revisions and organizational changes that aimed to help \\"improve consistency, clarity, accuracy, and ease of use.\\" Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, Hon. Janice Schneider testified before a joint House committee hearing stating \\"Every reclamation practice contained in the proposed rule has been successfully implemented by a mine operator somewhere in the country.\\" and that the rule was based on industry best practice. The Stream Protection Rule covered waterways near surface coal mining operations in order to avoid pollution of rivers and streams, and also called for the restoration of streams that had been damaged by dangerous, heavy metals like mercury and arsenic. The Rule would have protected an estimated 6,000 miles of streams over the next two decades, by establishing that coal companies were in fact, not allowed to damage the \\"hydrologic balance\\" outside their permit area and enforcing a 100-foot buffer around streams to preserve native species. The Interior Department had also said that the rule would protect 52,000 acres of forests as a default of keeping coal mining debris away from nearby waters. Expected effects and impacts On January 11, 2017, a report for members and committees of Congress was published by the Congressional Research Service, entitled \\"The Office of Surface Mining's Stream Protection Rule: An Overview.\\" The report described the history of law, regulation, and litigation that had led to the new rules. The report also summarized a report, Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Stream Protection Rule, that was prepared for the Interior Department's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. That draft regulatory impact analysis (RIA) outlined the costs of the new rules to the coal mining industry, and provided an overall cost-benefit analysis of the rules. The draft RIA found that \\"added administrative costs resulting from the rule are expected to be small for industry, adding on average about $0.01 per ton of coal mined\\", although cost in Appalachia would be expected to be up to $0.04 per ton. Cost for small operators were expected to be higher. The draft RIA cites SMCRA Section 507(c) to assist these operators. The draft RIA expected administrative cost for government to range from $1,830 to $2,546 per mine depending on the region. The draft RIA found that under the proposed rule, coal production would \\"decrease in aggregate by about 1.9 million tons annually, or approximately 0.2% compared with production expected under the baseline,\\" reflecting mainly substitution of natural gas for coal by U.S. power plants. The draft RIA also found that the rule would \\"reduce adverse impacts on the environment and human heath\\" and that the rule's stream restoration and reforestation provisions would result in an estimated \\"2,811 acres of forest improved annually and 20 acres of forest preserved annually.\\"  Challenges and overturning  President-elect Trump's pro-coal mining stances promoted during a Republican campaign rally in Louisiana. Republicans, including Donald Trump, had made reducing regulation, and especially environmental regulation, a key message in their campaigns in 2016, and Paul Ryan had issued a plan called \\"Better Way\\" that laid out methods to reduce regulation, including use of the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress and the President to force federal agencies to retract regulations that they judge go beyond what the law requires. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had also claimed that the rule would decrease the number of coal- related jobs. When the Stream Protection Rule was published, it was immediately challenged in court by the Republican state attorneys general of several states, as well as the coal mining company Murray Energy. The states challenging the bill were Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming, all of which are coal-mining states.Daniel W. Staples & Ryan Kocian, 13 Coal States Sue USA to Block Clean Water Rule, Courthouse News Service (January 19, 2017). When the new Congress met in 2017, controlled by Republicans in both houses, a coalition made up of 124 organizations, including Greenpeace, the National Women's Law Center, the Center for Biological Diversity and the AFL–CIO, sent an open letter urging Congress not to overturn the Rule. In early February 2017, Congress voted to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a \\"resolution of disapproval\\" to revoke the Stream Protection Rule.H.J.Res.38 - Disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of the Interior known as the Stream Protection Rule., Congress.gov. The resolution to repeal the bill passed in the House by a 228-194 vote and in the Senate by a vote of 54-45, largely on party lines, with Republicans voting in favor and Democrats voting against.FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 73, Office of the Clerk of the House, United States House of Representatives.Vote Summary: Question: On the Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 38), 115th Ogress, Secretary of the United States Senate. According to the Center for American Progress, the 27 representatives that sponsored or co-sponsored the review of the rules received nearly $500 million from mining interests in 2016. Trump signed H.J. Res 38 on February 16, 2017, overturning the Stream Protection Rule. When he signed the resolution repealing the rule, Trump predicted that striking down the rule would save thousands of U.S. mining-related jobs. Republican Bill Johnson, the U.S. Representative for Ohio's 6th congressional district and sponsor for the disapproval measure, stated, \\"Make no mistake about it, this Obama administration rule is not designed to protect streams. Instead, it was an effort to regulate the coal mining industry right out of business.\\" Effects of revocation  Subsequent to the revocation of the Stream Protection Rule by the Trump administration, many scientists, when interviewed, said that it would have had an insignificant impact on the activities of coal companies. Moreover, the US energy industry had generally reduced its use of coal in favor of cheaper natural gas and to a lesser extent renewables, and analysts said that even if the Stream Protection Rule had made coal more expensive for them, it would not have had much of an effect on the industry; its revocation meant little to them as well. The revocation of these regulations left unclear what regulation would be used to implement the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.

Educational Publishing Co. 1908 Education Davies' father had an above-average education, and was Davies's first teacher. Davies entered formal education at age 7, enrolling at the school at Neuaddlwyd near Aberayron. His education at Neuaddlwyd was largely religious, with the school being primarily aimed toward producing preachers and ministers, rather than academic scholars. Davies's teacher was the school’s headmaster, the Congregational minister Thomas Phillips (1772 - 1842). Davies was here when the first Welsh missionaries left Wales for Madagascar, namely, David Jones and Thomas Bevan, who Davies later regarded as ministerial colleagues. In 1822, at age 18, he was accepted into the Independent Academy at Newtown under the care of Edward Davies, Davies' fellow pupils were David Rees and Samuel Roberts. It was here that Davies mastered the elements of Hebrew, Syriac, Aramaic, Greek, Latin and divinity. General literacy was typically reserved at this time for the wealthy and the clergy. Davies accepted an invitation to Glandŵr, Pembrokeshire, on 6 months probation, and was ordained into the parish on 28 March 1827. Two years later he founded Moriah church, Llanwinio, Carmarthenshire, but he remained at Glandŵr until 1863. Upon leaving Glandŵr after 35 years of service, Davies transferred to Moriah church, where he remained until he died. He served as chairman of the Union of Welsh Independents from 1873. Personal life Davies married Phoebe Griffiths (granddaughter of John Griffiths) on 22 July 1833. Phoebe fell ill and died on 16 September 1844. They had four children, all of whom died early. First was his youngest child, David, who died aged five on 4 October 1848. He was fatally wounded by a falling stone after climbing through a gap in a cobblestone wall. He was buried at Moriah. Elizabeth Davies died on 20 February 1859, at the age of 19. She suffered from a burst blood vessel during a severe cold, and later died following a short illness. Like her brother David, she was also buried at Moriah. Mary Anne Davies died shortly after giving birth to her first child on 10 January 1860, at the age of 26. She was buried at Penycae, near Llanarth. Mary Anne left behind her baby boy, named David Jones, who was then cared for by an aunt and uncle at Wern Mill. Davies lost his last child, John Griffith Davies, on 14 March 1861, aged 25 years. He was blown from the mast-head of the ship Hibernia, after passing the Liverpool lightship. Despite a long search, his body was never found. The Hibernia was travelling from Liverpool to New Brunswick.Mardy, T. (1908). Notable Welshman (1st ed., p. 375). London: herald Office, Castle Square, Carnarvon Publications His published works include poems, songs, scriptural translations and Welsh literary essays. His better known work, \\"Notes on the Minor Prophets (Y Proffwydi Byrion)\\" was an original translation into Welsh from Hebrew (with marginal Latin), Syriac and Greek readings. The translation is considered to be his greatest feat; the result of forty years of research and labour. Davies' other papers include translations - Llyfr Coheleth and Llyfr Hosea; Lectures on St. Peter's Epistles, Horae Petrinae (Darlithau ar epistolau Pedr), and a collection of his own original verse and poetry - Flores Poeticae (casgliad o'i farddoniaeth).

The Davies Manuscripts The National Library of Wales houses the Davies collection, comprising over 70 items of personal correspondence, essays, diaries, sermons, translations of segments of the New Testament, with commentaries, poetry, lectures, almanacs, and miscellaneous papers. In addition to the Davies collection is the Album of 'Clwydwenfro', assembled by one of Davies' pupils and admirers, the Reverend John Lloyd James (Clwydwenfro). The album contains hundreds of items pertaining to the life and death of John Davies, the majority of which are letters. Books, proposals, church attendance figures, account records, sermons, poetry and music. Pseudonyms in publications Davies used a number of pseudonyms in his writings. His best-known pseudonym was Shôn Gymro (or Siôn), which translates in Welsh to \\"John Welshman\\", a typically generic name for what may be deemed to be a hypothetical and average, male Welshman. Other names used in his writings were Castellanus, often used with his English correspondence, and Shôn Llethi (or Siôn), used when writing in Welsh. While \\"Shôn Gymro\\" is regarded to be his better known pseudonym for Welsh writing, Shon Llethi may have originally served as a nickname for more personal affairs, before also evolving into a pseudonym for which he would sign his poetry and essays. Davies' official name recorded with the Cardiganshire local council at the time of his death was \\"John Glandwr Davies\\", suggesting that Davies was also known by the name of \\"Glandwr\\", the town in which he held a ministerial role at the local parish.

The acronym stands for Hyperuricemia, Pulmonary hypertension, Renal failure in infancy and Alkalosis. And it's due to mutations in the mitochondrial SARS enzyme. It is an autosomal recessive disease, that has a prevalence of less than one in a million. One in fifteen of the village's inhabitants were found to carry the genetic mutation. Presentation Those affected were born prematurely, and suffered from feeding difficulties and developmental delays. They presented with progressive kidney disease and primary pulmonary hypertension, and ultimately died. Genetics The cause of this condition is a mutation in the SARS2 gene (seryl-tRNA synthetase enzyme) which has to do with protein translation.

The battle was a Hospitaller victory, but both sides suffered heavy losses. Background Following their conquest of Rhodes, which they made their base of operations, the Knights Hospitaller quickly assumed military action in the waters of the Aegean Sea. Their targets were not only Turkish ships, but also a Genoese vessel carrying out trade with Mamluk Egypt in defiance of an embargo on such activities by the Pope, even though the Genoese had assisted the Hospitallers in their capture of Rhodes. When the Genoese sent an envoy to Rhodes to demand the ships' release in 1311, the Knights refused. In retaliation, the Genoese gave 50,000 gold florins to Mesud, Emir of Menteshe, to attack the Knights. Battle Masud seized several Rhodian merchants in the mainland, and Genoese and Turkish galleys began attacking Hospitaller shipping. In 1312, however, the Hospitaller fleet managed to intercept the fleet of Menteshe at the island of Amorgos. The Turks having landed on the island, the Hospitallers burned all 23 Turkish ships, and proceeded to attack the Turks. According to a 15th- century chronicle, over 800 Turks were killed, but the Hospitallers too had heavy losses, with 57 Knights and 300 foot soldiers being killed. A contemporary letter by an Aragonese ambassador to the Council of Vienne, however, mentions 1,500 Turks and 75 Knights killed.

Economic contributions  Behrend completed her PhD on 'Absence Under Full Employment' at Birmingham, before moving to the University of Edinburgh in 1954, to take up a research lectureship at the new social sciences research centre led by Professor John Macmurray. She remained at Edinburgh for the whole of her academic career. Behrend's research focused primarily on labour and industrial relations, in particular the interrelationships between economics and psychology in understanding how people operate at work. She coined the phrase 'effort bargaining', in relation to her research into the ways in which workers relate their effort to the pay they receive, observing that workers will work at less than their highest capacity in order to match their level of effort to what they perceive to be a fair amount of work for their pay.Gordon Marshall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Sociology (1994), p. 144. She also came up with the 'blue Monday index' which measures the difference between Monday’s and Friday’s absence rates, and how these voluntary absence varied by types of worker.

The incident was broadcast on live television by news helicopters. Jones died by suicide as a form of protest towards health maintenance organizations after he had been diagnosed as HIV-positive several months earlier. Footage of his suicide was shown in the 2002 documentary film Bowling for Columbine. Biography Jones was born on April 15, 1958 and was from Long Beach, California. He worked as a maintenance worker at the Renaissance Hotel in Long Beach, a job he had been employed at since 1995. He lived in a small two-bedroom bungalow off an alleyway in Long Beach. He lived alone with his pet dog Gladdis, a 7-year-old Labrador-whippet mixed-breed. By April 1998, Jones was suffering from both HIV and cancer. His neighbors and fellow workers were unaware that he had any health problems. Jones confided to a friend in early April that he had found a flesh-colored growth on his neck. The doctors at first were unsure of its cause but later confirmed that it was cancer. Jones believed he was being misled by his health insurer and also told his best friend that he was HIV- positive. Death Standpoint By the end of April 1998, Jones believed he was going to die and so he decided to take his own life in a way that would draw publicity to his situation. He believed it was no one's fault other than his own for getting himself into his situation. Jones would later be quoted as saying, \\"I'm not happy with what's happening to my situation and I'm going to draw attention to it whichever way I can. My paramount goal is for no one other than myself to get hurt.\\" Suicide On Thursday, April 30, 1998, around 3:00 p.m., 40-year-old Daniel Jones parked his dark gray Toyota pickup truck on the transition loop from the Harbor Freeway to the Century Freeway in Los Angeles (). Jones sat in the front of his truck with Gladdis. He began pointing a loaded shotgun at passing cars on the freeway, causing motorists to report him to the police. Jones himself then called 911, revealing he was emotionally distraught about health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and the circumstances surrounding his HIV. Jones said that he was in pain because of mistreatment by the HMO in whose care he had been placed. He complained that it would take him a month to schedule an appointment with a doctor and another month to get the results of a test. As was confirmed later, aside from being HIV-positive, Jones also suffered from cancer. During the call, he fired off several rounds from his shotgun, with one of them going through the roof of his truck. Authorities then closed the two freeways, preventing anyone from approaching him. Jones remained in his truck the entire time, as police and news helicopters monitored his movements. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Special Weapons Team began to assemble and got into position around him. Jones then reached into a backpack he owned and took out clothing and a videotape. He then began throwing the items over the freeway wall. Afterwards, he got out of the truck and walked across the empty freeway. Jones then unfurled a large, square banner with white handlettering that read: \\"HMO's are in it for the money!! Live free, love safe or die.\\" Jones had made the banner specifically for the occasion and displayed it for the news helicopters to see. As it was pretty windy on the interstate at the time, Jones weighted the banner down with a container to stop it blowing away. Jones continued to make obscene gestures and returned to his truck several times to pet Gladdis. As authorities prepared to negotiate with him, Jones suddenly returned to his truck and sat in the front seat. Intending to take his own life, Jones ignited a Molotov cocktail inside his truck. The vehicle suddenly burst into flames and was set ablaze. Jones got out of the vehicle however and ran across the freeway as he was engulfed in flames and smoke, with his hair, pants and socks all on fire. Jones tried to pat out the flames and managed to peel off his pants. He then continued to wander about looking dazed and disoriented. He walked to the edge of the freeway gesturing angrily. It appeared as if he was about to jump off the freeway; however, he changed his mind and backed away from the edge, before returning to his ablaze truck. Moments later, at around 3:50 p.m., he retrieved his shotgun from the back of the truck and then walked back across the freeway. He placed the shotgun beneath his chin, pulled the trigger and committed suicide. He then fell to the ground with the cameras still rolling and playing the event live to viewers watching at home. As it was a Thursday afternoon, it was witnessed by many children, whose after- school cartoons had been interrupted to broadcast the incident. Jones died 15 days after his fortieth birthday. Aftermath The standoff between Jones and the police had lasted close to fifty minutes. Police were concerned that there was a bomb or multiple booby traps still inside the truck. Therefore, they hesitated to move in. The truck meanwhile continued to burn with Gladdis still trapped inside it. Jones' body remained splayed out in the middle of the freeway with his own blood all around him. Eventually, police approached the truck and searched the inside of it. They found the remnants of several Molotov cocktails, a number of shotgun shells and the charred remains of Gladdis, who had perished in the fire. During the standoff, Jones had thrown a videotape over the freeway wall. When recovered by the authorities, who viewed the video, it was discovered that it was a videotaped suicide note recorded by Jones on the previous day. In the video, Jones sat on his couch next to Gladdis and said, \\"I'm not going to fight the disease. It has affected my neurological system. I'm not going to end up crazy.\\" A police source who viewed the video said that Jones complained he was in pain. The videotape explained Jones' motivations and laid blame for his suicide. Jones reportedly says in the video, \\"I'm a dead man,\\" and signs off by declaring, \\"See ya!\\". Controversy Because Jones' suicide was witnessed by children, that led many to criticize Los Angeles television stations' practice of airing police pursuits live. The incident prompted a wave of criticism about live news broadcasts, proposing changes in the way they were handled in the future. A total of seven television stations broadcast Jones' suicide live. Both KTLA channel 5 and KTTV channel 11 had interrupted children's programming to cover the suicide, while KNBC channel 4 had interrupted The Rosie O'Donnell Show. Both KNBC and KTLA had their cameras tightest on the coverage and so viewers were able to see the graphic suicide in close detail. KNBC issued an apology saying, \\"We did not anticipate this man's actions in time to cut away, and we deeply regret that any of our viewers saw this tragedy on our air.\\" The station, as well as the Fox Broadcasting affiliate, offered viewers numbers they could call for counseling. KTLA also released a statement saying, \\"KTLA shares with its viewers their distress.\\" KCBS-TV channel 2 moved to a wide shot before Jones committed suicide because they were reportedly concerned over his erratic behavior. The channel brought a psychologist into the studio later that day to hold a live discussion regarding distressing live media coverage. They later released a statement saying, \\"This is the danger of live television, you've got to be on your toes, and you have to be ready to pull back immediately.\\" KCAL-TV channel 9 reportedly received an estimated 120 calls during the broadcast prior to Jones even taking his life, requesting the station to cut away from the story before things got out of hand. In popular culture The footage of Jones' suicide has been shown in many documentaries outlining the incident. It appeared in Michael Moore's 2002 documentary film, Bowling for Columbine. See also *R.

Life  Early life  He was the son of the kammerjunker Jakob von Benzon (who owned estates in Christiansdal, Tirsbæk and Ågård) and Sophie Catharine Holm, an opera singer at the Danish Royal Theatre. This made him part of the prominent Benzon family at Funen. He took up an artistic career relatively late, after encouragement from an uncle, and studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen from 1833 to 1836, though he won no medals there. In 1835 he painted a portrait of Hans Christian Andersen (now in the Museum of National History at Frederiksborg Castle) – its subject called it \\"quite atrocious\\", though Weger used an engraving of it as the frontispiece for the edition of Andersen's writings which he published in Leipzig. Benzon also exhibited portraits, genre paintings and one history painting in Leipzig from 1836 to 1846.  Success in Düsseldorf and Paris  Encouraged by his professor J.L. Lund, in 1840 or 1841 Benzon travelled to Düsseldorf, where he married the painter Marie Therese Hubertine Rosalie Cazin – their home became the most brilliant cultural hub in the city according to the painter Elisabeth Jerichau Baumann. He sent back two paintings to Denmark from the city – in 1842 The Last Confession (also known as A Sinner on His Deathbed or The Death of Don Juan) and in 1844 The Death of Saint Canute. In 1845 he travelled to Paris, from which he sent back The Norman Lord Hastings occupying an Italian city by stealth for the 1846 Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition. He also won a gold medal from Louis Philippe for Louis IV of France recognizing Richard I and his successors as dukes of Normandy in Rouen in the presence of Harald Bluetooth. However, he ended up in debtors' prison in Paris, where he died of cholera on 30 September 1849. He belonged to the Düsseldorf School, which was rejected back in Denmark by the art historian N.L.

Official DC synopsis He-Man and the Masters of the Universe team up with the ThunderCats—the epic crossover event you've waited thirty years to see! In his ever-living desire to destroy the mighty ThunderCats, Mumm-Ra quests for a weapon that can rival the legendary Sword of Omens: He- Man's Sword of Power! But his dimension-spanning scheme kick starts a cataclysmic crisis that will embroil heroes and villains—Masters, Mutants and ThunderCats—in a mind-blowing six-part saga! Plot After another defeat at the hands of Lion-O Lord of the Thundercats, Mumm-Ra returns to his Black Pyramid to restore himself. After being healed, Mumm-Ra's masters, The Ancient Spirits of Evil claim to have found a weapon that will defeat the Thundercats once and for all, The Power Sword of He-Man. On Eternia in Eternos city, Prince Adam awakens with a start and races to a ceremony in his honor only to find the assemble heroes, as well as Adam's father King Randor have been waiting for him over a half hour. King Randor berates his son claiming Adam is clearly not ready for the responsibility of taking on royal duties. Suddenly, an earthquake shakes the city and all look up to see Third Earth, home of the Thundercats and Mumm-Ra tearing through space into orbit above Eternia. Back on Third Earth, the Thundercats are startled by the earthquakes and the appearance of Eternia in their skies. Their long time mentor, Jaga appears in his ghost form and tells them about Eternia and that he fears that both worlds will live or die together. Lion-O raises the Sword of Omens to grant himself sight beyond sight to see what danger the Thundercats now face. Back on Eternia, Third Earth's presence has caused massive earthquakes that the heroes of Eternia rush to defend the population against. Finally, a massive tidal wave rises up and swamps the city throwing Adam, Randor, and Adam's talking pet tiger Cringer over a balcony and into the waters. Adam manages to save the unconscious Randor and pulls both of them to higher ground with Cringer. As Adam raises the Sword of Power to become He-Man the Sorceress of Grayskull arrives to stop him, telling him that an evil has come for the sword and she will secure it within Castle Grayskull. When Adam hands the sword over the Sorceress stabs him clear through the chest, revealing herself to be Mumm-Ra in disguise. After confirming their allies on Third Earth are safe from the quakes the Thundercats prepare to head to Eternia. Lion-O speaks his fears about the mission to Panthro, wondering if he, as the Thundercats ruler, is up to the task ahead. Panthro encourages the young king and says both the Sword of Omens and the Thundercats have faith in him. Lion-O thanks his longtime friend as they head to the ship with the others bound for Eternia. Mumm-Ra gloats as he holds up the sword as Adam remains impaled on it, saying he can sense all evil as well as a lack of evil. Adam's lack of it was the beacon that allowed Mumm-Ra to find him and probe his mind to take a form Adam trusted to give up the sword. Adam manages to grip the sword and summon the power of Grayskull to transform into He-Man, healing his wounds. Mumm-Ra and He-Man battle as Mumm-Ra uses the sword against both He-Man and Cringer. Just as He-Man gets the upper hand Mumm-Ra vanishes in a flash of light. He reappears in a dark corridor and hears the Ancient Spirits of Evil speaking to someone. The Spirits say that both the sword and Mumm-Ra are his to do with what he pleases as long as he fulfills his end of the bargain. Before Mumm-Ra can react he is blasted to dust and Skeletor reaches down and picks up the Power Sword telling the Spirits they have a deal. Skeletor retreats to his lab with Mumm-Ra's helmet full of ashes and the Sword of Power and begins working. He quickly finds that, despite his condition, Mumm-Ra is still alive. Amused, Skeletor tells Mumm-Ra that he found out about the Spirits through the Golden Disks of Knowledge and struck a deal with them: the Power Sword and Mumm-Ra in exchange for freedom from the Black Pyramid, something Mumm-Ra was never able to do. He-Man and Cringer tend to King Randor who suddenly awakens in a panic worried about Adam. He-Man assures Randor that Adam is safe and that Adam is just as worried about him. Suddenly both men are attacked by the combine forces of both the Mutants of Third Earth and Skeletor's minions. After a furious battle that sees He-Man overcoming Evil Lynn's magic, the Mutants weapons, and physical attacks on all sides, He-Man defeats them all with help from Randor. Back in Skeletor's lair at Snake Mountain he explains to Mumm-Ra that he could never wield the Power of Grayskull without it consuming him. But by mixing Mumm-Ra's ashes to a potion it will link Mumm-Ra's ever living power to him allowing him to use the Power Sword. Despite Mumm-Ra's protests Skeletor drinks the potion and summons the Power of Grayskull to him adding He-Man's strength to his own. He-Man suddenly is transformed back into Prince Adam in front of Randor who is horrified as his son collapses in his arms with the lethal wound still in his son's chest. Skeletor revels in his newfound power saying that despite the fact he could not have gotten it without the Spirits help, he has no intention of freeing them from the Pyramid. Snake Mountain is suddenly rocked by an attack and a wall explodes in front of Skeletor revealing the full team of Thundercats with Lion-O leading the charge. Skeletor's strength initially pushes the Thundercats back and the battle is joined. All of them take turns in attacking Skeletor who laughs off the attempts saying they have no idea the power he now wields. Lion-O attacks and manages to wound Skeletor while Skeletor slashes Lion-O's eye with the Power Sword. In the midst of battle Mumm-Ra tries to assert dominance now he, in ash form, has been bonded to Skeletor. Skeletor tells Mumm-Ra to back off as he is fighting Mumm-Ra's mortal enemies but it is too late. Lion-O realizes the two are bonded and uses Mumm-Ra's weakness against his own reflection to drive Skeletor off and retrieve the Power Sword. Skeletor manages to teleport away trying to regain control from Mumm-Ra and the two fight an internal battle for their now shared form. Mumm-Ra manages to take command and reassume his original form but in doing so loses Skeletor the power he received from the sword. The two quickly realize they are too evenly matched and bonded thanks to the potion and Skeletor says he has a way they can both get what they want. Lion-O and the Thundercats arrive at the damaged Eternos to find all the heroes in morning as Adam has died from his wounds. Shocked that he was unable to return the Power Sword to its rightful owner Lion-O speaks alone with King Randor. Lion-O says he had heard Randor's son was a great hero and Randor says he didn't know Adam was He-Man and is only now realizing himself what a hero Adam was. Lion-O tells Randor that despite not knowing he is sure Adam felt the love of a father from him. Randor thanks Lion-O and tells him in turn not to worry about living up to anyone's ideals but to be a ruler from his own heart. The city is suddenly rocked by another earthquake and everyone present looks up to find four massive giants attacking the city. Mumm-Ra and Skeletor have used their combined power and knowledge to free the Ancient Spirits of Evil and take control of them and now have set them loose to attack Eternia and take the power of Castle Grayskull. Lion-O pledges the Thundercats aid to help Randor fight off the giants as the two different groups banter. Lion-O sees the Mutant leader Slithe brought in after his defeat at He-Man's hands and the Mutant mocks Lion-O saying he will never beat Mumm-Ra because he can come back from death time and again. Slithe's comment gives Lion-O an idea and he orders the Thundercats to help Randor and Eternia's heroes defend Grayskull. He then takes Adam's body and flies back to Third Earth with Cringer, who refuses to leave Adam's side. They arrive at Mumm-Ra's Black Pyramid and find that some of the evil warriors who attacked He-Man retreated here to loot Mumm-Ra's treasures while he is away. Lion-O and Cringer manage to get Adam's body and the Sword of Power into Mumm-Ra's sarcophagus in the hopes it will bring Adam back as it has Mumm-Ra. When nothing happens at first Lion-O tells Cringer to check on the villains looting the Pyramid and uses the Sword of Omens power to transform Cringer into a version of his Battle Cat form. Now alone Lion-O prays his efforts will work and then hears a scratching inside the sarcophagus. He hears a whisper of Adam calling the power of Grayskull and the sarcophagus explodes and an enraged He-Man comes out and attacks Lion-O. Realizing the combination of power has healed He-Man but also driven him insane, Lion-O defends himself with the Sword of Omens and the two heroes clash. Lion-O separates He-Man from the Power Sword but He-Man is too strong and nearly drowns Lion-O in Mumm-Ra's mystic pool before the Thundercat can escape. Realizing he has to increase his own power to survive Lion-O calls for the Sword of Omens to give him Power Beyond Power. Now more matched in strength Lion-O manages to wrestle He-Man from behind and put the Sword of Omens in front of him, giving He-Man sight beyond sight. Seeing a horrifying future vision where Mumm-Ra and Skeletor have killed or enslaved everything snaps He-Man out of his madness and he thanks Lion-O as the two introduce themselves. The two heroes find Cringer, transformed back to his normal form, happily licking his paw over the defeated villains and Cringer runs into He- Man's arms thrilled his best friend is alive. The three rush back to the ship desperate to get back to Eternia before it is too late. The four Ancient Spirits of Evil have arrived on the doorstep of Castle Grayskull while Skeletor and Mumm-Ra look on. Randor has assembled an army alongside the Thundercats and the combined heroes attack the giants. Man-At-Arms, Tygra, and Panthro assemble a cannon of combined Eternian and Thundarian tech to attack the Spirits while the others buy them time. Inside the Castle the Sorceress summons the Castle's defenses to shield it from attack when Jaga's spirit form arrives. Jaga tells the Sorceress that he believes there is a way to stop the Spirits but the answer lies on the Thundercat's destroyed home world of Thundara. The Sorceress opens a portal in space and time for Jaga and her to slip through and get the item they need. Outside, despite the hero's best efforts, the Spirits close in on Castle Grayskull. When Man-At-Arms, Tygra, and Panthro fire the cannon at one of the Spirit's head it simply laughs off the attempt and turns to attack the castle. Tygra then uses his powers of illusion to make Grayskull seem to disappear much to the Spirit's confusion and Mumm-Ra and Skeletor's frustration. Jaga and the Sorceress appear to the heroes and tell them that Jaga knew of a Golden Disk of Knowledge among the treasures of Thundara. The two use the retrieved Disk to expose that Skeletor and Mumm-Ra used Skeletor's Disks of Knowledge to bring the Spirits to physical form and each of the four Spirits have a Disk on their chest which Jaga and the Sorceress now expose. If the heroes destroy the Disks the Spirits will be defeated. Teela and Cheetara take a flyer and attack one of the Spirits and are saved when Cheetara's sixth sense allows them to avoid an energy blast. Teela sets the flyer to crash into the disk and as both escape the first Spirit is destroyed. Orko manages to accidentally enlarge Snarf, who hits the Disk on the second Spirit, stopping it as well. Wilikit and Wilicat join Buzz-Off and Stratos to attack the third Spirit and after Buzz-Off and Stratos are injured in the distraction WiliKit and Kat break the Disk stopping the third Spirit. Meanwhile, Tygra collapses, unable to hold the illusion any longer, and Castle Grayskull is revealed in front of the final Spirit. The Spirit attacks the Castle and the Sorceress manages to hold a protective shield to keep the Castle safe. Panthro and Man-At-Arms aim the cannon at the Spirit and fire, knocking it back. Before they can fire again the Spirit grabs Man-At-Arms and Panthro leaps to free him. While the Spirit is distracted by the two Tygra manages to aim the cannon at the Disk and fire, destroying the last Spirit. As the heroes celebrate, Skeletor watches and comments to Mumm-Ra that the Spirits did better than expected. But now that they have weakened the heroes it is time for the two's true plan to be completed. Combining their power Skeletor and Mumm-Ra absorb the power of the Spirits as they begin to fade and use the power to form themselves into an amalgamated being now called Mummator. The now super charged Mummator attacks the weakened heroes. He-Man, Lion-O, and Cringer, now transformed back to Battle Cat, arrive at the battle but too late. They find all the heroes defeated and wounded and Grayskull's drawbridge open and exposed. He-Man tells Battle Cat to look after their friends and He-Man and Lion-O rush into the Castle. He-Man guides Lion-O through the maze of Castle Grayskull saying it is a nexus of worlds and reality through space and time and they must find the Sorceress before it's too late. They arrive at a shattered door that shocks He-Man as he says no intruder has ever gotten so far into the Castle. Both heroes charge forward and find the newly formed Mummator imprisoning the Sorceress and holding an orb that is the heart of the Castle, the key to all the power that Greyskull possess. Mummator says that he has won and only needs He-Man's Sword of Power to unlock the orb and gain the power to control reality throughout the Multiverse. He-Man and Lion-O attack but realize that they need to get the orb and the Sword away from Mummator. Lion-O says that since the Castle is a nexus of realities they can use it to get Mummator away from the orb. Together the heroes push Mummator off an edge and the three plunge downward only to land in an Eternia that is controlled by Mummator. Taking advantage of Mummator's confusion He-Man gets the orb and he and Lion-O use the orb's connection to Grayskull to teleport away. They appear in a newsroom and find themselves in a reality where He-man is based on Earth as a Superman like hero. When Mummator appears both He-Man and Lion-O grasp the orb together to use their combine will to get back to the Castle. Instead they find themselves in a reality where He-Man and Lion-O's allies have merged. Mummator takes advantage of their surprise and manages to get He-Man's Sword before Lion-O uses the orb to get them away again. As they arrive in a new reality they realize Mummator will follow now he has the Sword but Lion-O looks down and sees where they are. They have arrived on Thundara before it exploded and Lion-O sees his father stay behind as the young Lion-O, Jaga, and the other Thundercats escape the planet. Shaken and surprised Lion-O is attacked by Mummator and as the three grapple they arrive back inside Grayskull as Mummator manages to get the orb from Lion-O. Now, with both the Sword and the orb, Mummator summons all his minions, Mutants and Skeletor's allies alike to attack He-Man and Lion-O while he activates the orb. But the Sorceress, who managed to get free while they traveled realities, summon the recovered heroes to support Lion-O and He- Man. Mummator starts to unlock the orb and the Power of Grayskull begins to flow into him. Even He-Man begins to weaken as his power is taken. Lion-O manages to slash Mummator's wrist and get the Power Sword back but it is too late to stop the orb from unlocking. Realizing they have one last chance He- Man and Lion-O risk combining the remaining power of Grayskull in He-Man and the Power Sword with the Sword of Omens even though both realized it could destroy them both. He-Man fires his power into the Sword of Omens as together he and Lion-O summon the Power Beyond Power at Mummator. The resulting blast of energy overwhelms Mummator and blasts him apart into Skeletor and Mumm-Ra before disintegrating both beings. The resulting blast transforms He-Man back into Adam but seals the orb and both the Sorceress and Jaga claim victory for the heroes. Lion-O looks and sees a portal back to Thundara and is desperate to return and save his father and his world saying he won't run away again. Adam gently holds his friend back saying he could go back and save his father but would be changing the here and now. Adam tells Lion-O that his destiny lies in the future not in the past... just as Lion-O's father would have wanted. Lion-O reluctantly agrees as Randor watches both young men from a distance in pride. Later the heroes exchanges thanks and gifts as they load the Mutants onto the Thundercats ship and Skeletor's evil warriors onto a prison ship. Lion-O says he is sorry to go but they must return before third Earth snaps back to where it belongs. Adam, now returned to his He-Man form, thanks his new friend saying it will be odd now that Randor and everyone knows his secret. Lion-O says its best fathers and sons have no secrets so that Randor can know Adam as the hero he has always been. When He-Man says that Lion-O is wise for his age Lion-O sheepishly tells He-Man he is in fact twelve years old in mind and living in an adult body. Astonished, He-Man says that if he is this wise as a boy then he will be even greater as a man later in life. As the Thundercat ship takes off He-Man and Lion-O shout the other hero's battle cry in farewell. Reception The comic has received mostly positive reviews.

Plot In an alternate DC universe, the last Guardian, Ganthet, exercises his power to take one each of the remaining power rings to another universe in order to escape Nekron, the embodiment of death (seen in the Blackest Night series), who has destroyed almost all life in the universe. In the Star Trek Kelvin Universe, the crew of the Enterprise discover the remains of Ganthet and the power rings on a rogue planet. They accidentally activate the power rings even as they come under attack by a squad of Klingon ships under the command of General Chang. The blue, indigo, and violet rings find new owners among the crew of the Enterprise (Chekov, McCoy, and Uhura, respectively), while the yellow ring finds a new home with Chang. The red and orange rings head into space, eventually finding owners with the son of the leader of the Gorn Hegemony and the Praetor of the Romulan Empire, respectively. Hal Jordan arrives, wondering why Ganthet's body is on board the Enterprise, and not long after, Carol Ferris (Star Sapphire) and an injured Saint Walker arrive. Meanwhile, Sinestro, Larfleeze, and Atrocitus have also survived, and contact their respective color rings' new owners. Battle ensues, and it is discovered that three other Green Lanterns -- John Stewart, Guy Gardner, and Kilowog, have survived the death of their universe, but what no one has counted on is that Nekron has also made his way to the new universe, and is determined to slaughter it as he did his own, and starts by restoring the destroyed planet Vulcan, and making Black Lanterns out of the populace. Ultimately, Nekron is defeated by combining the ring energies. Sinestro, Atrocitus, and Larfleeze escape.

Personal life Stanford lives in Okura in the Auckland region and is the daughter of a Dutch immigrant. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in politics from the University of Auckland, and cites a lecturer, Dr Raymond Miller, as the reason for her passion for politics. She is married, meeting her husband Kane while at Rangitoto College, and has two children. Stanford has worked in export sales as well as producing local television shows. This included being the producer of a reality TV show called Noise Control, in which she and a camera operator followed a noise control team around Auckland. In filming one episode, a person pointed a gun at her and her cameraman; the episode was one of the most watched in the series. She also produced the show Last Chance Dog, and wrote scripts and did other work on Piha Rescue for more than six years. Political career In 2013, Stanford started working in the office of Murray McCully, the MP for . She joined the National Party at the same time. When she started in the office, she worked there two days a week as one of three jobs while also having two children. She later worked there full time, and prior to running for parliament, she held the role of Senior MP Support. Stanford describes McCully as her mentor, calling him \\"a political master.\\" McCully retired from Parliament in 2017, and the National Party selected Stanford as his replacement for . Stanford had not previously stood for parliament or other office. The East Coast Bays electorate has been a safe seat for National since 1987; since then McCully held either East Coast Bays or , which covered a similar area. In the 2017 general election, Stanford won the electorate easily, with 66% of the vote. In the 2020 election, Stanford stood again for East Coast Bays. During the campaign she also attended a debate of Auckland Central candidates, as National had not selected a new candidate for the electorate by the debate. According to preliminary results, Stanford retained East Coast Bays, albeit with a reduced margin, winning 55% of electorate votes.  Political views  In her maiden speech Stanford spoke on matters of conservation, sustainability, marriage based on love rather than gender, and a desire to see political parties work with one another to seek enduring, practical solutions. In a 2018 interview with a local magazine, she said her priorities in her first term included resourcing police stations in her electorate, improving local roading projects, and supporting local schools. Stanford's political views sit more on the progressive side of the National Party. Stanford supported both the abortion and euthanasia conscience votes in 2019. She has sat on the environmental select committee and has been involved in developing National's environmental policies. In 2019 she supported students who were striking for climate action, despite her party leader and many other National MPs initially opposing them. She believes that the Green Party could work with National, saying that if the Greens \\"could just relax a little bit... they could do so much good.\\" Stanford says that her blood \\"runs blue and it always will\\", but acknowledges a touch of green, saying \\"maybe it's a tealy blue\\".

Plot When temporally displaced astronaut Colonel George Taylor goes missing on the alternate future Earth known as the \\"Planet of the Apes\\", Cornelius investigates and discovers an ancient ring, unlike anything his universe has ever seen. As its power echoes through the multiverse, the Guardians of the Universe must reveal to the Green Lantern Corps a secret they had hoped would remain buried. With the Green Lantern Corps, led by Hal Jordan, racing to get to the source of this power before Sinestro can get his hands on it, they will discover a secret concealed by the Guardians of the Universe on an alternate Earth trapped within a time loop-the setting of Planet of the Apes. After the Sinestro Corps drains energy from members of the other Lantern Corps for a specific objective, on the alternate Earth of Planet of the Apes, chimpanzee scientist Cornelius finds a mysterious artefact in a newly formed crater. Due to Sinestro's machinations, Hal Jordan and Sinestro are transported across the multiverse and trapped in the Planet of the Apes universe. Jordan is captured by Ape City security personnel, while Sinestro captures Doctor Zaius, the orangutan leader of Ape City. Back in Earth-0's universe, the Guardians reveal to members of the Green Lantern Corps that one of their earlier experiments after the creation of the Manhunters was a Universal Ring, which possessed the power to tap into the entire emotional spectrum. Realising that it was too powerful to control, although they lacked the ability to destroy it, the Guardians instead trapped the universal ring in an alternate Earth that is trapped itself within a time loop. On this world, humanity destroyed itself in a nuclear war and is replaced by sapient apes, assisted by a genetically engineered virus. While Hal breaks out of Ape City prison with the assistance of Zira and other dissident chimpanzees and Sinestro abducts Dr. Zaius and attempts to stage a coup, the Green Lantern Corps decide to 'recruit' Gorilla Grodd to assist in their recovery of Hal Jordan and the Universal Ring. Meanwhile, in the underground settlement of telepathic mutants within the ruins of New York City, Cornelius has used the Universal Ring to repel attackers and has discovered 20th century astronaut Colonel George Taylor dead from a bullet wound. Angered at the loss of life and the presence of a cobalt bomb doomsday device worshipped by the mutants, he dismantles the device. Matters get more complicated when Cornelius' efforts provide the mutants with power rings of their own, while the Red Lantern Corps discover the existence of the Planet of the Apes and the presence of the Green Lanterns there and give pursuit. Sinestro and Dr. Zaius discover a long-concealed secret about the origin of this future alternate Earth. Reception The comic has received positive reviews.

She was known for her children's poetry and authored what is perhaps the first verse novel for children. Life O'Keeffe was born in Dublin in 1776. Her father was the Irish Catholic playwright John O'Keeffe and her mother was the Protestant actress Mary Heaphy. Adelaide and her brother came under her father's care after her parents' marriage ended. As Donelle Ruwe writes in her study of O'Keeffe's life and works: \\"When Adelaide was six, her father lost his eyesight and discovered that his wife was having an affair with a Scottish actor named George Graham. Enraged, John O'Keeffe left Ireland forever, taking his children with him.\\"Donelle Ruwe, \\"Dramatic Monologues and the Novel-in-Verse: Adelaide O'Keeffe and the Creation of Theatrical Children's Poetry in the Long Eighteenth Century.\\" Lion & the Unicorn 33 (2009): 219-34. Mary Heaphy later married Graham, for she felt that, as a Protestant, her first union with a Catholic was \\"not sufficiently binding to prevent a subsequent marriage.\\"Adelaide O'Keeffe,\\"Memoir,\\" in O’Keeffe'’s Legacy to His Daughter. edited by Adelaide O'’Keeffe.(London: For the Editor, 1834. xi-–xxxviii) xiv. When Mary secretly visited the children, O'Keeffe was, in Adelaide's own words, \\"inflamed with jealousy\\" and sent both children to France. Seven year-old Adelaide went to a French convent, and there she stayed until the outbreak of the French revolution five years later. Twelve-year-old Adelaide returned to England, and she never again was far from her father. She served as his amanuensis, and she supported him through her earnings as a governess and an author for almost forty-five years until his death in 1833. As her father's amanuensis, Adelaide O'Keeffe would have recorded his work The Farmer in 1787; Wild Oats in 1791 and in 1795 The Wicklow Mountains. O'Keeffe's first published work is the historical novel Llewellin: A Tale,Adelaide O'Keeffe, Llewellin: A Tale. 3 vols. London: Cawthorn, 1798-1799. and throughout her writing career, she would return to the historical fiction form, often seeking out narratives in which her heroes suffered the trauma of a disrupted childhood, often caused by the separation of the hero's parents, as is the case with her final novel The Broken Sword, or, A Soldier’s Honour: A Tale of the Allied Armies of 1757.Adelaide O'Keeffe, The Broken Sword, or, A Soldier’s Honour: A Tale of the Allied Armies of 1757.

Zenobia, as depicted by O'Keeffe, is taught multiple religions (and also teaches others, including her husband) as she converts from paganism, to Judaism, and finally to Christianity. As Donelle Ruwe suggests, although Zenobia's final conversion to Christianity is intended to prove that Christianity is the superior religion, the fact the same pedagogical lessons and approaches are used to sway her from one religion to another ultimately calls into question the very nature of religious belief.Donelle Ruwe, “Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra: Adelaide O'Keeffe, the Jewish Conversion Novel, and the Limits of Rational Education.\\" Eighteenth-Century Life 36.1 (Winter 2012): 30-53.

It is modeled directly after Adèle et Théodore, ou Lettres sur l'éducation (1782) by Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis (translated as Adelaide and Theodore). O'Keeffe's most famous prose work is a retelling of the first five books of the Bible, Patriarchal Times; or, The Land of Canaan: a Figurate History (1811).Adelaide O'Keeffe, Patriarchal Times; or, The Land of Canaan: a Figurate History. London 1811. Although O'Keeffe was a successful novelist, her greatest claim to literary fame was for her children's poetry. She was one of the three main contributors to the important two-volume collection, Original Poems for Infant Minds (1804, 1805) along with Ann Taylor and Jane Taylor. She followed this publication with Original Poems: Calculated to Improve the Mind of Youth and Allure it to Virtue (1808), The Old Grand-Papa, and Other Poems, for the Amusement of Youth (1812), National Characters Exhibited in Forty Geographical Poems (1818), A Trip to the Coast. Or Poems Descriptive of Various Interesting Objects on the Sea-Shore (1819), Mamma’s Present of Pictures and Poetry (1820), and Poems for Young Children (1848). Her poem \\"Prejudice\\" was included in the collection The Hermit and the Traveller (1816) along with poetry by Thomas Parnell and Oliver Goldsmith. In British Children's Poetry of the Romantic Era: Verse, Riddle, and Rhyme (2014), Donelle Ruwe discusses O'Keeffe's many contributions to children's poetry traditions, such as her creation of the children's verse-novel and her use of active learning techniques and innovative verse forms.Donelle Ruwe, British Children's Poetry of the Romantic Era: Verse, Riddle, and Rhyme (2014) Houndsmills: Palgrave MacMillan.

It is north-northeast from the town of Bolsover. The closed spandrel bridge is the earliest-known bridge in Canada to be constructed using reinforced concrete, and is based on a modified Melan System of bridge reinforcement. In 1988, it was designated a National Historic Site of Canada for representing a transitional period in bridge construction and a milestone in civil engineering in Canada. Structure Designed by the federal Department of Railways and Canals, the bridge was built in 1905. The original design was for a concrete arch bridge typical of its era. Before construction began, the design was updated by integrating reinforced concrete using a modified Melan System of bridge reinforcement, which had been pioneered by its namesake Josef Melan in the 1890s. Among the changes were the installation of struts underneath the arch, and a reduction in the mass of the arch and its abutments. The concrete mass is reinforced with curved steel girders. The arch is a closed spandrel, in which the structural load of the deck is carried to the arch ribs via spandrel walls. It has a radius of , and its vertical clearance of is sufficient for vessels to navigate underneath. The deck is wide, and spans over the lake, anchored by reinforced concrete abutments. The concrete spandrel walls are marked to imitate the voussoir layout common to stone arch bridges and the \\"coursed stonework of stone masonry bridge abutments\\". National Historic Site of Canada The bridge was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on 24 June 1988 for its early use of concrete in bridge construction, for being the earliest-known bridge in Canada to be constructed using reinforced concrete, and for its \\"close association with the Trent-Severn Waterway\\".

First mentioned in 1377 as working for Philip the Bold, he later became valet de chambre to Louis I, Duke of Orléans from 1391 on and afterwards to his son Charles, Duke of Orléans until at least 1411. While no surviving works have been with certainty attributed to him, some panel paintings are considered likely to be his work. Those mentioned in contemporary sources include a number of large works for Philip the Bold in 1395, which were placed in Chartres Cathedral, Virgin, St. John and the Trinity for Louis I for a church in Paris in 1396, and in 1397 a reliquary chest for Queen Isabeau of Bavaria and a panel painting of Louis the Pious and Louis of Toulouse. In 1406 he was working on a large panel for the French Parliament. As was typical for court painters in this period, his activities weren't restricted to panel paintings but he is also mentioned as creator of decorations for festivities, and cartons for tapestries. In May 2012, the Prado Museum in Madrid acquired a panel, presumably the central part of a triptych, depicting Christ in the Garden of Olives with Saint Agnes and Louis I d’Orleans as a Donor. It is the only known contemporary depiction of Louis I. An Angel of the Annunciation in the Museum of Laon, the right wing of a triptych, which is attributed to the Master of the Retable of Pierre de Wissant, may be another work by Colart de Laon.

Life She was the daughter of Karl Friedrich von Dacheröden (died 20 November 1809), chamber-president of the Kingdom of Prussia, and his wife Ernestine Friderike, countess of Hopfgarten (died 1 May 1774). She grew up in Erfurt and her parents' estates in Burgörner and Auleben, where she befriended the von Lengefeld sisters, Caroline (later one of her best friends) and Charlotte (later wife of the playwright Friedrich Schiller). On 29 June 1791 she married Baron Wilhelm von Humboldt in Erfurt.Steffen Raßloff: Gastliches Haus. Im Haus Dacheröden am Anger waren einst große Geister zu Gast und heiratete Wilhelm von Humboldt seine Frau Caroline von Dacheröden. In: Thüringer Allgemeine, 1 December 2012. Their marriage was an unconventional one and both allowed each other many freedoms. Until 1797 they lived in Jena next door to Schiller but they later lived apart for several years until from 1819 they shared Wilhelm's family home at Schloss Tegel. Caroline's only brother Ernst died childless in 1806.Anna von Sydow (ed): Gabriele von Bülow.

She took her three children on a 7-month trip from Paris to Spain, where she catalogued and wrote about Spanish artworks - her works on the topic were praised by Goethe, who published some of them. Her favourite city was Rome, where she was in contact with several German and Danish artists living in the city (Gottlieb Schick, Christian Friedrich Tieck, Bertel Thorvaldsen, Wilhelm von Schadow, Karl Wilhelm Wach), financially supporting them and buying several of their works. She had a particularly intense friendship with the sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch, whilst Angelika Kauffmann and Louis I of Bavaria also stayed in her house. She also ran a form of literary salon in Berlin, where politicians, scientists and writers met. She was also in extensive correspondence with major figures, through which she took part in the currents of the day and played a major role in her husband's writings.

When he was just 11, he could already recite and discuss the Spring and Autumn Annals. As his family was poor and could not afford books, he borrowed books from others to read and memorised them after reading through once. Although he had a good-looking appearance, he was also known for his quiet and introverted character.(恱年十二，能說春秋。家貧無書，每之人間，所見篇牘，一覽多能誦記。性沈靜，美姿容，尤好著述。) Houhanshu vol. 62. When the eunuch faction came to power during Emperor Ling's reign (168–189), many scholar-officials decided to leave the political arena to avoid getting into trouble. Xun Yue claimed that he was in poor health and led a life of seclusion. Many people did not know about his talent. Only his younger cousin, Xun Yu, treated him respectfully and regarded him highly.(靈帝時閹官用權，士多退身窮處，恱乃託疾隱居，時人莫之識，唯從弟彧特稱敬焉。) Houhanshu vol. 62. In the 190s, the warlord Cao Cao came to power and took control of the Han central government, while paying nominal allegiance to Emperor Xian. At the time, Cao Cao held the appointment of General Who Guards the East ().Zizhi Tongjian vol. 62. He initially recruited Xun Yue as his subordinate. Xun Yue was later promoted to a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate (). As Emperor Xian was fond of studying literature, he ordered Xun Yue, Xun Yu and Kong Rong, who were known for their expertise in literature, to mentor and guide him. Xun Yue was further promoted to Custodian of the Private Library () and Palace Attendant ().(初辟鎮東將軍曹操府，遷黃門侍郎。獻帝頗好文學，恱與彧及少府孔融侍講禁中，旦夕談論。累遷秘書監、侍中。) Houhanshu vol. 62. At the time, Emperor Xian had been reduced to the status of a figurehead emperor and Cao Cao was in fact the de facto ruler even though he was nominally a subject of the emperor. Although Xun Yue longed for Emperor Xian to retake the reins of power from Cao Cao, he knew that it would not become reality and worried that his ideas would go to waste. As such, he wrote the five-chapter Shenjian (申鑒; Extended Reflections), in which he discussed, among other things, the importance of education and customs, of the balance of rewards and punishments, and the requirements of social justice – including a proposal for restoring the well-field system and opposing the excesses of the landed gentry.(時政移曹氏，天子恭己而已。恱志在獻替，而謀無所用，乃作申鑒五篇。其所論辯，通見政體，旣成而奏之。其大略曰： ... 帝覽而善之。) Houhanshu vol. 62. More generally, he sought to defend the Han dynasty's traditions by arguing for the preservation and striving for ideals of government, in spite of the realities of human failing. The Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny pointed out that when Xue Yue advocated for the need to rely on good officials rather than the vagaries of individual rulers, he could almost be seen as approaching a view of constitutional monarchy. Ch'en Ch'i-yün, who translated the Shenjian into English in 1980, described Xun Yue as \\"Confucianist in his approach to scholarship, Taoist in his relativistic view of reality, and Legalist in his pragmatic approach towards politics.\\" Emperor Xian also enjoyed reading historical texts. He found Ban Gu's Book of Han, which covered the history of the Western Han dynasty (206 BCE – 9 CE), very complicated and difficult to read. He thus ordered Xun Yue to write another version of the Book of Han in the style of the Zuo Zhuan, a commentary on the historical text Spring and Autumn Annals. Xun Yue did as instructed, and completed and presented 13 chapters of the historical text Annals of Han () in 200 CE. Apart from being a study of history, the Annals of Han sought to demonstrate how imperial virtue had accumulated over generations. It implied that the process had continued under the Eastern Han dynasty and that one should look to a restoration of the Han dynasty rather than usurpation by a subject, no matter how powerful he was. In recognition of his contributions, Xun Yue was promoted to a Master of Writing () and awarded an ink brush and a scroll.(帝好典籍，常以班固漢書文繁難省，乃令恱依左氏傳體以為漢紀三十篇，詔尚書給筆札。辭約事詳，論辨多美。其序之曰：「昔在上聖，惟建皇極， ... 中興以前，明主賢臣得失之軌，亦足以觀矣。」) Houhanshu vol. 62.

Erected sometime between about 1795 and 1811, it is a high-quality example of late Colonial and early Federal architecture, and a well-preserved surviving example of the town's early architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Francis Benedict Jr. House stands in a rural area of northeastern Norfolk, on the north side of North Colebrook Road just east of its junction with South Sandisfield Road. It has a west- facing main block, to which ells have been added to the east side. The house is on a ridge overlooking Benedict Pond to the west. The main block is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The front facade is five bays wide, with sash windows topped by shallow cornices, and the centered entrance framed by wide sidelight windows and topped by a less shallow cornice. There is a three-part window above the entrance. The first ell is a 1-1/2 story Cape style structure which was probably built first. The interior of these spaces follow typical period arrangements, except that the ell and main block were apparently designed to each house a separate family. . The land in this area of Norfolk was granted to members of the Benedict family in 1759, in one of the town's early divisions of land amongst its proprietors. The ell of this house was built about 1795 by Francis Benedict Jr., and stood south of his father's house (no longer extant except for a cellar hole). He built a dam and sawmill on Benedict Pond in 1795, which was a likely event associated with its construction. The main house was probably built around 1811, the year his daughter Wealthea married Erastus Smith. The house was used for some time as a multigenerational home for members of the Smith and Benedict families. The area's agriculture declined in the late 19th century, with many farms abandoned; this house was by the late 1890s in the hands of summer residents. The house is a distinctive stylistically conservative blend of late Colonial and Federal styles.

Seigneur of Alès. Bernard was the son of Raymond II, Viscount of Narbone from 1066 to 1067. The name “pelet” refers to a fur that the nobility wore over their cuirass and coats-of-arms. Raymond distinguished himself as a great warrior during the First Crusade.  Joining the First Crusade  Many of the chroniclers of the Crusades, including William of Tyre, have praised the valor and piety of Raymond. Guibert of Nogent’s Dei Gesta per Francos goes so far as to describe him as a mythological hero. Raymond’s exploits in the crusade are recorded in the Chronicle of Raimond d'Agiles. Raymond was first under the command of Hugh the Great, Count of Vermandois, as part of his army and was present at the siege of Nicaea in 1097. At the first siege of Antioch, from 21 October 1097 to 2 June 1098, Raymond was under the command of Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse. During the second siege, he commanded the 11th Corps of the Christian army, with Isoard I, Count of Die (Diois), Gérard de Roussillon, William V of Montpellier and Guillaume-Amanieu d'Albert. Raymond also played a role in the saga of the Holy Lance. After the discovery of the lance and questions about its authenticity, Peter Bartholomew went through an ordeal of fire to verify it as a holy relic. Raymond pulled Peter from the fire, saving his life temporarily (he died of his wounds twelve days later), and the lance was discredited. Talamania and the Massacre at Ma’arra Raymond constituted a small army of cavalry and infantry, and advance two days' march from Antioch, where they captured the castle of Talamania from the Syrians. He then implemented an ambitious raid on Ma'arrat al-Nu'man (Maarat), infamously known as the siege of Ma'arra, where he encountered a Muslim army under the command of Ridwan of Allepo, against whom he first prevailed despite of the inequality of numbers of troops. But his adversaries returned at full strength, forcing him to retreat and defend himself until the evening of July 27, 1098. His army, overwhelmed by adversaries, loss of troops, thirst and weariness, decided to abandon the fight and regroup in the castle. Raymond and Peter I of Narbonne, Bishop of Albara, eventually abandoned their positions to travel with Raymond IV. The victory at Ma’arra is tainted by the alleged cannibalism of the Crusaders, being low on food, and allegedly turned on both the vanquished Muslims as well as dogs. It is not clear that Raymond was still in the city when this happened.  Tortosa  On February 14, 1099, Raymond and Raymond I of Turenne deployed with 100 horsemen and 200 footmen, to take the town of Tortosa (also known as Tartus or Antartus) defended by the formidable castle at Marqab. They besieged it and despite their numerical inferiority, gained the advantage by lighting many fires in the surrounding countryside. The defenders of the castle, including the governor of Torosa (a subject of the Emir of Tripoli) were frightened and fled before dawn, abandoning the city to the Crusaders on 18 June 1099. Raymond then followed Count Raymond IV in his expedition to Tripoli in the unsuccessful siege of Arqa, detailed in the March down the Mediterranean coast.  Siege of Jerusalem  Raymond led a mounted the assault on Jerusalem on July 14, 1099, contributing to the capture and rescue of the Holy City. In early July 1099, nine Genovese ships arrived at the port of Jaffa to resupply the Crusaders. Then Raymond IV dispatched Raymond, Guillaume de Sabran, and Raymond I of Turenne, with 50 horsemen to protect them. The latter, having advanced, found Geldemar Carpenel, Lord of Caiphas, struggling with an army of 700 Muslims from Rama who attacked him, inflicting great losses on his infantry. Raymond’s forces allowed the Genoese to disembark, enabling them to take Jerusalem.  Marriage and Children  Raymond married Agnes, of an unknown family. Raymond and Agnes had two children: * Raymond (d. 1148) * Bernard II, (d. 1172), Seigneur of Alès, also Count of Melgueil, jure uxoris (as Bernard V of Pilet). Raymond returned from the Crusades and died sometime after 11 July 1120. His son Bernard continued as the Seigneur of Alès.

Tevis as a female preparatory school. In 1975 the school was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and in 1978, it was opened as a restaurant known as the Science Hill Inn by Donna Gill and Tim Barnes. History On March 25, 1825, Julia A. Tevis founded the Science Hill Female Academy as a preparatory school for women. It was one of the first schools founded for girls west of the Allegheny Mountains and utilized the Lancastrian system, in which older or more advanced students taught the younger pupils. The school name derived from Tevis' belief that girls were as able to master the sciences as young men. Though she attracted students from throughout the country, the majority of her students were from wealthy Southern families. These aristocrats wanted their daughters to have social polishing and learn French, music and art. Tevis taught these traditional courses, but also taught her students history, math, rhetoric, science, and Latin. In its early days, the school was funded by the Methodist Church, with which Tevis' husband, John, served as a missionary. The initial class had thirty-five pupils, of which six were boarders. Within twenty-five years, the class had grown to two hundred students with half of them boarding at the school. Its reputation was widely known and it had students from throughout the country as well as students who attended as a day school from the local community. A reunion of alumni was held in 1875 with three generations of the thousands of students who had been educated at the school in attendance. Tevis operated the school until 1879, when she sold it to Wiley Taul Poynter, who operated the school as a secondary academy to prepare young women for further education at institutions such as Vassar, Wellesley and other well-known women's colleges. He and his descendants operated the school until 1939, when it closed due to financial constraints caused by the Great Depression. When it closed, Science Hill Academy had the distinction of being the oldest Protestant female academy in continuous operation in country, as well as in Kentucky. When the school closed, the daughters of Dr. Poynter lived in the home and rented out the dorm rooms as apartments. The buildings were sold in the early 1950s to Mark J. Scearce, who renovated the former chapel as the Wakefield-Scearce Antique Gallery and continued utilizing the dormitories as apartments for let. In 1978, the former dining room was converted to a restaurant by Louisville restaurateur Tim Barnes, who opened it with chef, Donna Gill. Ellen Gill McCarty later became the chef of the restaurant which has become a focal point in Kentucky's culinary history. Architecture The Tevises bought the two-story brick home, laid in Flemish bond, in 1825. Initially there were eight-rooms, which included a parlor, library, bedroom, central hallway on the ground floor, with a stairway leading to additional bedrooms on the upper floor. The school was begun in the library and in 1826, the Tevises added a wing extending east toward the back of the house as a dormitory. Teachers and students resided in the dormitory, which had a chapel on the ground floor and an outside stairway. The original style was of the Federalist period and featured wide ash floors with reeded doors and window treatments. The only room retaining these original features in the downstairs bedroom. In the 1840s, during the Greek Revival Period the house was remodeled to reflect the tastes of the era and many of the mouldings were changed. The doors and windows featured crossest, or double-mitered ears, at the top of the lintel which was supported by side columns. A second wing was added in 1860 which housed a second dormitory and a northern extension between the house and dormitories adding a dining room, kitchen and pantries. In 1861, the courtyard was enclosed by erecting an interior balcony supported by chamfered posts with dentilated moldings. Identical stairways, flanking the arched double-door leading to the chapel, ascended from the east end of the courtyard and connected to the second-story rooms. Light was provided by an octagonal windowed cupola centered in the roof of the courtyard. In the 1880s, when the Poynters took over occupancy of the house, they remodeled the north side, adding a hall and two rooms. The relocated the stairway from the right side of the hall to the opposite side and opened the entrance hall to extend into a back hall. At the same time, the original entrance was replaced with a door featuring side-lights and a leaded-glass transom. Legacy The papers of the school are housed at the Filson Historical Society in Louisville, Kentucky and contain letters, papers and records of the school from its founding through 1975. In 1975 the school was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, because of its significance as both a school and a historical building. Kentucky Educational Television featured the school in a 2007 broadcast for the program Kentucky Life. Since 1978, the facility has been operated as a restaurant known as the Science Hill Inn, which was opened by Donna Gill and Tim Barnes. It also houses the Wakefield-Scearce Galleries, an antique furniture and collectibles gallery.

Life  Harriott was born in St Thomas, Jamaica, the son of a doctor's assistant, Oscar Harriott, and his wife, Minna, (née Powell), a teacher; they later moved to the island's capital, Kingston, but went to the United States to study, leaving Chester and his siblings with relatives. A gifted pianist from a young age, he appeared on local radio stations and followers set up a fund for him to study in London; in 1950, he joined Trinity College of Music and while there met Arthur Bennett, who taught him modern music. Through that connection, Harriott was introduced to the nightclub scene in central London, playing at the Langham Club for the likes of Princess Margaret. Throughout the early 1950s, he performed at Gateways, a pioneering lesbian club in Chelsea, as well as the Mandrake Club in Soho and the Sunset Club, where he performed alongside the celebrated jazz saxophonist Joe Harriott. After finishing at Trinity, he partnered up with John Porter to form a double-act, but soon switched to form a lasting duo with Victor Brown. Performing for eight years as Harriott and Evans, a variety act, they travelled to Paris, toured and sold 50,000 copies of one album. In 1962, they parted ways and Harriott carried on performing solo before working for Granada Television from 1967. He opened a restaurant called Truffles in 1985 and retired from performing following an illness in the late-1990s. He outlived his first wife, Petronia, and later married a magician called Claudine. Harriott died on 4 July 2013 aged eighty years. He had five children, including the television chef Ainsley Harriott.

Stara Reka was established on 19 March 1981 to protect the unique ecosystems of the Balkan Mountains. It spans an area of 1974.7 hectares, or 19.747km2.  Geography  The reserve is situated a few kilometres to the north of the town of Karlovo in the northern section of Plovdiv Province. It covers the southern slopes of the Balkan Mountains sprawling from Levski Peak (2166 m) and Golyam Kupen Peak (2169 m) on the main ridge of the mountain range south along the valley of Stara Reka river and its tributaries. The altitude of the reserve varies between 1000 and 2169 m. The southern slopes of the Balkan Mountains have a milder climate with a snow cover lasting for an average of 120 days annually. The soil types are diverse ranging from mountain meadow soils in the highest areas to brown forest and cinnamon soils at lower altitudes.  Flora  The forest habitats in Stara Reka Reserve usually include four to five tree species. The lowest parts of the reserve are covered by sessile oak (Quercus petraea), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), South European flowering ash (Fraxinus ornus), European hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) and Oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis). Mixed beech and fir forests along with field maple (Acer campestre), Heldreich's maple (Acer heldreichii) and silver birch (Betula pendula) grow at higher altitudes. Forests of Norway spruce (Picea abies) grow at the highest altitudes. The reserve is rich in rare species. 45 species are listed in the Red Book of Bulgaria, of them 20 are endemic to the country, such as Primula frondosa, Centaurea kerneriana, Campanula trojanensis, Stachys alpina, etc.  Fauna  Stara Reka Reserve contains the westernmost population of chamois along the southern slopes of the Balkan Mountains. It is also an important sanctuary for the brown bear, gray wolf, wildcat, European pine marten and Eurasian otter.

Non- communicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, include cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. The role of the Task Force is to bring relevant actors from across the United Nations (UN) system and national governments together to develop whole-of- government, whole-of-society approaches for the prevention and control of NCDs. Following the establishment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, the Task Force's scope of work was expanded to include “NCD related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)” such as addressing mental health conditions, violence, injuries, nutrition and environmental issues that contribute to the global burden of NCDs. The Task Force promotes multisectoral action for the prevention and control of NCDs, supports countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and supports countries to move towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The work of the Task Force includes implementing the Global Joint Programme to conduct investment cases, coordinating interagency joint programmes and facilitating thematic working groups. The World Health Organization acts as a Secretariat for the Task Force. At the end of 2018, there were 41 members of the Task Force, some of which are from within the UN System. These agencies included: AfDB, ERBD, FAO, GFATM, IAEA, ICRC, IDB, IDLO, ILO, INCB, IOM, IOC, ITU,OECD,OHCHR, OIC, OSDP, UNAIDS, UNCTAD, UNDP,UNECA,UNESCO, UNEP, UNESCAP, UNFPA, UNHABITAT, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNODC, UNOPS,UNOSSC, UNRWA, UNSCN, UNU, UNWomen, WHO, WHOFCTC, WIPO, WFP, WorldBank, and WTO. Establishment The Task Force was established in 2013 by the UN Secretary General in an Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Resolution in response to the 2011 Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of NCDs. Overseen by the World Health Organization, the Task Force's mandate is to support the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non- communicable Diseases 2013–2020, as well as the NCD-related targets within Sustainable Development Goals. The WHO Director-General provides a report on the work of the Task Force through the UN Secretary General once a year to ECOSOC. Objectives The overall objective of the Task Force is to support the implementation of the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases 2013–2020 and the Sustainable Development Goals. The Task Force Strategy, 2019-2021 has four priorities in line with the Task Force's Terms of Reference and mandates provided through United Nations General Assembly Political Declarations and ECOSOC resolutions. The strategic priorities include the following: * Supporting countries to deliver multisectoral action on the NCD-related SDG targets * Mobilizing resources to support the development of national responses to reach the NCD-related SDG targets * Supporting countries by harmonising its work with other global health and development initiatives and forging multi-stakeholder partnerships and alliances at all levels to achieve NCD-related SDG targets * Being an exemplar for UN reform. Action  Global joint programme  The Global Join Programme is coordinated by the Task Force and the main focus of the programme is to develop national NCD investment cases to assist countries in quantifying the costs of NCDs and the benefits of scaled up action for prevention and control, both in the health sector and the economy at large. The burden of NCDs is of great magnitude and has both socioeconomic and developmental impacts and national NCD investment cases are aimed at empowering governments, especially ministries of health, to make a compelling, evidence-informed cases to advocate for NCD investments. Experiences from previously developed NCD investment cases have demonstrated that these reports help ministries of health better understand funding priorities, to reconsider budget allocations towards the prevention and control of NCDs, and to appeal to ministries of finance for increased investment in the area of NCDs as well as to justify the need for development of multisectoral engagement. The investment case framework quantifies the costs and benefits of NCD treatment and prevention in national currencies. This allows for demonstration of return-on-investments (ROIs) for various NCD prevention and control interventions e.g. if a government invests x million in NCD prevention, y million will be returned to the national economy over a z time period. This enables actors, such as ministries of health and ministries of finance, to easily compare different investment choices and the returns that they generate not only within the health sector but beyond. Twenty national NCD investment cases conducted to date and have highlighted the approach set out in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which recommended development assistance to be catalytic, allowing countries to raise resources locally for the implementation of the national SDG plans. Examples of these investment cases can be found on the Task Force website.  Joint programmes  = UNDP/WHO Joint Programme to catalyse multisectoral action on NCDs = The WHO-UNDP Global Joint Programme on NCDs supports countries to develop coordinated national responses on their NCD epidemics by strengthening efforts across sectors. The Joint Programme creates strong multisectoral partnerships at the national and subnational level by calling together different sectors around five priority areas for NCD response: national NCD investment cases; standardized mechanisms for stakeholders to collaborate on NCD prevention and control; municipal initiatives to address community-specific NCD challenges; cross-cutting approaches to deliver successes for NCDs; and multisectoral action to reduce key NCD risk factors and prevent diseases onset. These are developed in line with United Nations development group guidance and provide a mechanism for raising funds for the work of the Task Force at country level. = SAFER = SAFER is a new initiative and technical package released by WHO. The package outlines 5 high-impact strategies that can help governments to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and related health, social and economic consequences. SAFER is the newest WHO-led roadmap to support governments in taking practical steps to accelerate progress on health, beat NCDs through addressing the harmful use of alcohol, and achieve development targets. = Global Regulatory & Fiscal Capacity Building Programme: Promoting Healthy Diets and Physical Activity = In 2014 International Development Law Organisation (IDLO) signed agreements with WHO and the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) to build legal capacity to address public health challenges. The initial focus is on obesity, diabetes, healthy diets and physical activity. Also in 2014, IDLO, the WHO and the University of Sydney convened the first regional consultation on overweight, obesity, diabetes and law in the Western Pacific. IDLO will support further regional consultations and national capacity building of government, academic and civil society partners to strengthen national legal frameworks and capacity to address NCDs. Programs will be tailored to regional and national needs. = UN Joint Global Programme on Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control = To build on what exists and enhance progress, several UN agencies working under the Task Force established a five-year Joint Programme to prevent and control cervical cancer. The Joint Programme provides leadership and technical assistance in supporting governments and their partners build and sustain high-quality national comprehensive cervical cancer control programmes, ensuring women have equitable access to services. In addition, the Joint Programme working alongside global and national partners utilize new technologies to scale up action, reduce the costs of vaccines and apply innovative approaches to ensure women have access to functioning and sustainable high-quality services. = FCTC2030: Strengthening WHO FCTC implementation to achieve the SDGs = Tobacco is a major public health concern and a barrier to development around the world. The FCTC 2030 project is strengthening tobacco control in low- and middle-income countries through promoting and supporting governments to accelerate the implementation of the WHO FCTC. = ITU-WHO Mobile Health for NCDs Initiative = The International Telecommunications Union and the World Health Organization are developing programs that use mobile technologies to improve the prevention and control of NCDs. The two organizations collaborate with a range of Member States and other partners in a pioneering initiative which focuses on the use of mobile technologies to improve the prevention and treatment of NCDs. This partnership aims to contribute to global and national efforts to save lives, minimize illness and disability, and reduce the social and economic burden that NCDs create. = UNODC-WHO-UICC Joint Global Programme on Access to Controlled Drugs for Medical Purposes While Preventing Diversion and Abuse = The Joint Global Programme is a partnership between the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC), World Health Organization (WHO) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). The objective is to lead a coordinated worldwide response to improve access to controlled drugs for medical purposes, while controlling for abuse and diversion, therefore increasing the number of patients globally receiving appropriate treatment = UNODC-WHO Joint Programme for Drug Dependence Treatment and Care = The Joint Programme on Drug Dependence Treatment and Care is a collaboration between UNODC and WHO. The aim is to support the development of comprehensive, integrated health-based approaches to drug policies that can reduce demand for illicit substances, relieve suffering and decrease drug-related harm to individuals, families, communities and societies.  Thematic working groups  Thematic working groups allow Task Force members to align existing resources more effectively at both the global and country levels. The established thematic working groups focus closely on specific issues relating to NCDs such as tobacco, nutrition and alcohol and aim to encourage increased coordination between agencies in order to support the SDG 2030 Agenda.

Forms The phobia can take on several forms but revolves around common themes: Fear of spreading illness The most common reason for some degree of this phobia is the fear of spreading foodborne illnesses, through either undercooked foods, improperly prepared or cleaned foods, or concern about understanding the basic rules for proper preparation and storage of foods. Fear of the cooking process Many mageirocophobes fear the process: cutting themselves, burning themselves, or even having problems executing the steps needed to successfully render a dish. Some see it as a chore that is overwhelming.Psychology Today -Overcoming Mageirocophobia—the Fear of Cooking by Susan Albers Psy.D, 09.09.2010. Fear of recipes Another manifestation is the anxiety caused by reading recipes which can seem overwhelmingly complex, or of which the cook fears that they will not render faithfully because they might omit a critical step in the process, or might not be able to read between the lines of a process that is not documented well step-by-step. Another fear is of the sheer volume of recipes, which can leave the sufferer incapable of making a decision. Fear of food knowledge When we prepare food for ourselves or others, we become more aware of the ingredients, and, by doing so, the associated health benefits and/or risks of those foods and their consumption. Mageirocophobics can become obsessed with these issues which impacts their ability to cook or to appreciate the cooking of others. Fear of food intake Persons with eating disorders can become intimidated or fearful of cooking as it may lead to feelings of loss of self-control, inadequacy, or worry or guilt about triggers to their disorder. Symptoms Symptoms of the phobia can include being light-headed, difficulty breathing, a tingling or numbness of some part of the body, fainting, weakness, dizziness, feelings of a loss of control, excessive sweating, chills, chest pain, nervous, or feeling a constant sense of dread or doom about cooking, or stubbornness or outright refusal to cook. Causes Mageirocophobia can be caused by other personality traits, social anxieties or disorders. It can be set off by high expectations from other family members, failures with cookbooks, or difficulties in executing successfully in a culinary course. It can also lead to other phobias and social disorders.VeryWell.com - Mageirocophobia Treatment Education is the most common treatment, although psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, is indicated when the fear becomes so severe as to cause dysfunction for the individual who suffers from the phobia.

Description and history The five statues were installed in Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, and Seattle in 2016. Their collective installation was executed by 40 people; Rolling Stone described the precision with which the sculptures were erected: \\"At exactly 11 in each city – 8 a.m. on the West Coast – two people dressed as construction workers carried out a 6-foot-5, 80-pound object under a blue tarp, brushed away detritus from the ground, spread a thin layer of fast-acting, industrial-strength epoxy, held the object upright for a matter of seconds, and walked away, disappearing into the gathering crowds.\\" The statues, made using clay and silicone, depicted Trump with abdominal obesity, an \\"old man saggy butt\\", varicose veins, a \\"constipated\\" expression, a micropenis and anorchia, and were titled The Emperor Has No Balls on engraved plates at the base; they were commissioned from Joshua \\"Ginger\\" Monroe, a Las Vegas artist who designs monsters for haunted houses and horror films. The Cleveland statue was in the Coventry section of Cleveland Heights; it was taken down within an hour. The New York statue, in Union Square, was removed early that afternoon; the New York City Parks Department made a statement that it \\"stands firmly against any unpermitted erection in city parks, no matter how small\\". A bystander bit a piece out of the hair of the San Francisco statue, which was in the Castro District; it was removed early the next day, at a cost of about $4,000 because of damage to the sidewalk. The Seattle statue, which was in Capitol Hill, was claimed by a vintage store, No Parking on Pike, and the Los Angeles statue, on Hollywood Boulevard, by a local art gallery, Wacko, both before authorities could remove them. The following month, two more naked Trump statues, commissioned by a New Jersey arts collective, were installed on the roof of a warehouse overlooking the New Jersey entrance to the Holland Tunnel, where Indecline also placed an inverted US flag, and on top of a billboard in the Wynwood section of Miami; the Miami statue, which Indecline said was the same one originally placed in New York, was later moved by police request closer to the Wynwood Walls graffiti center.

He wrestled and managed primarily for territory promotions in the Southeastern United States from the 1950s until the 1990s, particularly in the Tennessee and Kentucky areas, including for National Wrestling Alliance, Southeast Championship Wrestling, Continental Wrestling Association, Continental Championship Wrestling, Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling and Smoky Mountain Wrestling. Professional wrestling career Ron Wright started wrestling in 1956 with his real life friend and future wrestling opponent Whitey Caldwell as well as his brother Don Wright, following an amateur start at the Kingsport Boys Club. Ron Wright and Caldwell soon caught the eye of Kingsport NWA promoter Mickey Baarnes as well as outlaw Buddy Russels for whom they made their debut on January 21, 1956. Both debuted as teenagers with a younger Ron Wright mostly working as a referee for Baarnes while the older Caldwell quickly made a name as a wrestler. Ron Wright gained a reputation for being a wrestling heel when in 1961 he seriously and legitimately injured Caldwell (putting him out of action for a year) who was by then a very popular wrestling babyface and television champion. Ron Wright was the most hated heel in his territory (area where wrestling promoters and wrestlers operated) for almost three decades, engaging in extremely physical, violent and bloody matches, mostly as part of a tag team and often with his brother Don Wright. His most well-known and frequent opponent was Caldwell who he would try to provoke to genuine anger in order to make their bouts better. He was known not only for being a nefarious cheat and bully but also for his speaking ability, both as a wrestler and as a manager, with a style based on local preachers. Despite mostly wrestling as a heel, he did however appear as a face in a tribute match for Whitey Caldwell after his friend's death at the hands of a drunk driver in 1973. By the end of the 1970s Ron Wright had mostly transitioned to an on-screen management role while becoming an off-screen secret owner of his local territory (the Kingsport, Bristol and Johnson City region in Tennessee, i.e. Tri-City area, part of the future Southeastern Championship Wrestling territory). He suffered a serious injury at the beginning of the 80s and disappeared from wrestling as a wrestler, manager and promoter until 1987 when he came back as a manager in Continental Championship Wrestling, then USA Championship Wrestling, and later in Smoky Mountain Wrestling. His ability to draw heat was so great that he was legitimately shot at three times by fans as well as being slashed with razor, resulting a in wound that requires 160 stitches. He also had his personal small plane burnt by persons unknown, possibly wrestling fans (Wright himself believed that the plane was burnt to cover up the theft of expensive parts). Wright noted, with regret, that he had caused four or five elderly spectators to have heart attacks over his antics. Personal life Ron Wright was married to Teresa Wright. He would race go-carts that he built as an avid mechanic, with his children. Ron Wright worked as a pressman alongside his wrestling career and during hiatuses. Despite making a substantial living as a wrestler, Ron kept his job to have benefits for his children in case of injury. He was well known for his charity work in Kingsport.

He called this his \\"chisel\\". Faced with a violent assault from Wright, a young scared rookie Kevin Sullivan in what he believed was actual self-defense tried to knock out Wright in the ring with a chain to which the veteran Wright replied with laughter and congratulations. He is also known for using a loaded boot, which wrestlers like Tony Anthony, The Grappler, Tom Prichard and Raven would use in later years. As a manager, Ron Wright would pretend to have a heart condition and implore fans not to distress him with loud sounds which would lead them to making as much noise as possible, in the hope of causing him a heart attack. In his later career as a manager, Ron Wright would constantly claim to have been a \\"scientific\\", \\"Christian\\" wrestler which would mean a face in 1980s wrestling terminology and claim never to have hurt an opponent despite being widely known to generations of audiences as one of the most violent, nefarious and cheating heels during his days as an active wrestler, especially in light of Whitely Caldwell's first and real injury. As a manager in Continental Championship Wrestling, Wright would illegally interfere in matches handing heels weapons, distracting the referee or physically hindering or assaulting face opponents. Next as a manager in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (run by Jim Cornette), a still relatively young (in his mid fifties) Ron Wright would develop his character further and appear in a wheelchair claiming that he needed to find a wrestler (eventually mainly Dirty White Boy but with help from other heels) to manage, in order to make enough money for hip and heart operations, while still continuing his illegal ringside activities to the ire of commissioner Bob Armstrong, and heel manager Jim Cornette.

She spent most of the twelve Nazi years in state detention, during which time she was badly tortured and made at least one suicide attempt. She did not outlive the Nazi regime. Hertha Sturm is the name by which she is identified in most sources referring to her political actions and to her experiences under the Nazis. It was the name she took on for her Communist Party work in January 1920 and retained thereafter. In addition to her birth name, Edith Fischer, she may also be identified after 1912, by her married name, as Edith Schumann. Life Provenance and early years Edith Fischer was born in Königsberg, at that time part of Germany, and the capital of East Prussia. Her father was a book dealer. She attended an all-girls' school in Königsberg till 1902 and then, between 1903 and 1906, the teacher training college. After this, between Easter 1906 and Autumn 1907, she was employed as a home tutor. She then passed the necessary exams to gain admittance to the University of Königsberg where for five semesters (probably two and a half years) she studied Medicine. In 1911 she joined the German Social Democratic Party (SPD). That year she also transferred to Leipzig University and embarked on the study of socio-economics ( \\"Volkswirtschaftslehre\\" / \\"Nationalökonomie\\"), a subject in which three years later, in July 1914, she would obtain her doctorate. Meanwhile, in 1912 Edith Fischer married Hermann Schumann. In 1914 she relocated to the other side of the country and took a job with the regional statistical office in Karlsruhe. The First World War broke out in July 1914, and by October 1915 Edith Schumann was in Berlin, working as an expert advisor and assistant at a surgery and work advice centre for war widows. She stayed in Berlin at least till the end of 1916. Between February 1917 and August 1918 she worked as a volunteer in the women's section of the wartime detention centre in Magdeburg: after August 1918 she was similarly employed in Munich. Communist politics She was still based in Munich in January 1919 when she joined the newly formed Communist Party of Germany (KPD), as a result of which she was dismissed from her wartime work. Military defeat was followed by a succession of uprisings across Germany, and in Munich Edith Schumann worked for the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic as a technical assistant to the secretariat of the Executive Council and Economic Council. After the Bavarian Soviet was crushed by a combination of still loyal government forces and \\"Freikorps\\" anti- communist volunteer units she fled from Munich after a warrant for her arrest, invoking the usual charge of \\"assisting high treason\\", had been issued. However, at the end of May 1919 she was arrested and then held in investigative custody in Munich's Stadelheim Prison. After two months the authorities closed the investigation, citing \\"lack of evidence\\". In December 1919 Edith Schumann arrived in Berlin at the national headquarters of the Communist Party where in January 1920, under the party name Hertha Sturm, she started a job in the party's national women's secretariat. Following the 3rd party congress which took place in February 1920 she became secretary to the national women's secretariat and also managing editor of the party news- magazine \\"Kommunistin\\" (\\"The [female] communist\\"). In 1921 Sturm participated as a member of the German delegation in the Second World Congress of the Comintern, held under the chairmanship of Grigory Zinoviev in Moscow during late July and early August. Here she was elected to the International Women's Secretariat (IWS), a position she occupied between 1921 and 1924. After this she became increasingly high-profile within the party, back in Berlin becoming international secretary of the IWS for Western Europe. However, throughout the 1920s the party proved itself prone to factionalism, and as the decade progressed, both in Berlin and in Moscow, the direction of the party was increasingly dictated by its non-inclusive hardline wing. At the ninth party conference, held in 1924, Hertha Sturm presented a paper on women's work. The left wing party leadership then identified her as \\"rightist\\" and removed her from her senior posts. (She was succeeded at the IWS by .) Sturm relocated to Moscow where between October 1924 and October 1928 she worked on IWS and other Comintern matters in close collaboration with Clara Zetkin. After she returned to Germany in 1928 Sturm found she was still identified as \\"rightist\\" and so she was not able to work for The Party in its head office. She nevertheless retained her party membership, while obtaining a job with the state statistical office in Berlin. Nazi years In January 1933 the Nazi Party took power and lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. The Reichstag fire at the end of February 1933 was promptly blamed on \\"communists\\" and those who had been politically active in the (now illegal) Communist Party of Germany either fled abroad or else found themselves targeted by the authorities. On 10 March 1933 Hertha Sturm was arrested in Berlin by members of the ruling party's quasi-military wing (SA): she was held in \\"protective custody\\" until 17 January 1934. In the summer of 1934 she made contact with Neu Beginnen (\\"New Start\\") and, using the cover names Gerda Stein and Ellen Croner, she worked with this left wing socialist group. On 4 September 1935 Hertha Sturm was arrested in Cologne. She was badly tortured and made a suicide attempt. Her case was heard on 12 March 1936 when the Berlin state court sentenced her to a five-year prison term. Hertha Sturm's subsequent fate remains unknown. The only available information comes from a letter sent by Ernst Torgler to Ruth Fischer. The letter is dated 27 November 1948, and in it Togler states in a passing comment, and without further elaboration, that Hertha Sturm lost her life in an air raid.

It was first discovered in the 1980s, in a nodule of sediments from the Karoo Supergroup. Dwykaselachus was named based on Dwyka Group, the group of sedimentary geological formation in the southeastern part of Africa. It represents the place where the type species Dwykaselachus oosthuizeni was found. Prior to its discovery, symmoriids were thought to be related to sharks, in the group Elasmobranchii. However, CT scans of its relatively intact skull showed traits such as brain shape and inner ear structure that are shared with cartilaginous fish from the group Holocephali, which includes chimaeras. This implies that the first major radiation of cartilaginous fish after the Devonian extinction was in fact holocephalians, rather than sharks as commonly believed.  History and discovery  Dwykaselachus was first discovered in the 1980, in a nodule of sediments from the Karoo Supergroup by an amateur paleontologist called Roy Oosthuizen. The discovery of Dwykaselachus reveals the origins of Chimaeras, also called ghost sharks, a species live in deep ocean. Chimaeras reliant on cartilage, which doesn't preserve as well as bone, therefore, there’re not enough fossil record to study for this species. Thus, chimaeras are unusual throughout the long span of their fossil records, therefore, it is difficult to understand the origin of this species. Until now, the chimaerpod evolutionary record consisted only isolated specimens of their characteristic hyper-mineralizer tooth plate. Fortunately, The Dwykaselachus oosthuizeni fossil provides the initial description based on visible material. In 2013, co-author Dr. Robert Gess, a researcher in the Geology Department and Albany Museum at Rhodes University in South Africa, CT-scanned the skull of Dwykaselachus, and showed a symmoriiform morphology that resembles a 3D-preserved model. At first, the skull was thought to belong a symmoriid shark, but after the CT-scanning, the image appeared to show anatomical structures that mark the specimen as an early relative of chimaeras. A research team led by Michael Coates from the University of Chicago Medical center has found that ghosts sharks, also named chimaeras, are related to the 280 million-year-old fish Dwykaselachus oosthuizeni. Chimaera-like features including tell-tale shapes of cranial nerves, nostrils and inner ears suggests that D. oosthuizeni was included in the group symmoriiform. Although resembling sharks in appearance, Dwykaselachus was not actually a shark, but rather had diverged from a common ancestor.  Description  The computed tomography (CT) analysis of Dwykaselachus shows a symmoriiform morphology that resembles a 3D-preserved model. In figure 2, the model with lateral view, exhibits some characteristically chondrichthyans features such as the large hepophyseal chamber and dorsally projecting endolymphatic duct. The most visible shared specialization with chimaeroids is the offset between the dorsally prominent mesencephalon chamber and the ventral level of the telencephalon space. Moreover, Dwykaselachus share the characteristic chimaeroid elevation of the midbrain, relative to forebrain. The discovered skull has unusually ethmoid cartilages which include large hemispherical nasal capsules. The nasal capsules are bridged by an internasal groove. Each capsule roof is shorter than the floor, suggesting that, unlike many sharks, the narial openings were directed slightly dorsally. The capsule wall openings include a canal for the olfactory nerve (nerve I), a foramen for the profundus nerve (nerve V), and an opening in the floor, which resembles the subnasal fenestra of Doliodus. The braincase roof is mostly complete, leave little space for the fontanelle. Therefore, a precerbral fontanelle, a signature of non-chimaeroid chondrichthyans, is either reduced or absent.  Classification  The phylogenetic analyses establish the importance of the shared similarities between Dwykaselachus and chimaeroids, suggesting symmoriiforms, including Dwykaselachus, comprise a sister clade to iniopterygians and holocephalans. The detailed fossil chondrichthyans data used in Michael et al.’s paper provided strong evidence supporting that hypothesis. Thus, expansion of holocephalian stem membership moves the chondrichthyans crown group divergence to a deeper phylogenetic node. Another study done by Michael showed that phylogenetic analysis confirms Gladbachus as a stem chondrichthyan. Strong evidence was provided to support chondrichthyans as a crown clade. It suggests that the initial evolutionary radiation of crown chondrichthyans is primarily post-Devonian, forming a significant component of the vertebrate recovery after the end-Devonian extinction. The current analyses focus on the conflicting patterns of character state distributions, implying repeated and convergent evolution of chondrichthyan-like specializations among the earliest total group members. Early chondrichthyan species suggest that the morphological disparity in the early members of the chondrichthyan total group was probably substantially greater than that which is observed.

She also taught acting in Danish at the theatre academy in Odense, appeared in films, worked as stage director and presented literary programs.  Career  Born in Haldensleben, Kehler first studied Romance languages, planning to become a theatre critic. When she played a small role in a student theatre project, she was called by the Theaterhochschule Leipzig. She studied acting there and performed at several theatres in East Germany, playing for example Luise in Schiller's Kabale und Liebe, Shen Te in Brecht's Der gute Mensch von Sezuan and Grusche in his Der kaukasische Kreidekreis. She also turned to musical theatre as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady and Seeräuber-Jenny in the Dreigroschenoper. She was a member of theatres in Brandenburg and Karl-Marx- Stadt. The musical parts in Brecht's plays led to her singing chansons, during her student years when she was called \\"singende Schauspielerin\\" (the singing actress). She took part in the first chanson competition in the GDR in 1967 and was awarded the special prize \\"Sonderpreis des Rundfunks\\". In 1971 she performed her first Brecht programme, singing settings by Paul Dessau, Hanns Eisler, Tilo Medek and Kurt Weill. Her recordings also appeared in West Germany and internationally. She turned to singing chansons in several languages. Tours took her to Algeria, Austria and most European countries including Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. From the mid 1980s, she taught at the drama school at Odense Teater in Denmark. After gaining fluency in Danish, she performed at Team Teatret, Herning, and Folketeatret, Copenhagen, remaining attached to Denmark for some 30 years. There she is remembered in particular for singing \\"Den sidste turist i Europa\\" (The Last Tourist in Europe) in Lars von Trier's film The Element of Crime\\".

Born in 1981, she studied in Vienna at the Academy of Fine Arts under Walter Obholzer, in Leipzig at the Academy of Fine Arts in the class of Neo Rauch and Astrid Klein and in Düsseldorf in the class of Tal R. She has produced multimedia works and exhibited together with the light technicians Hans Leser (HAU) and Martin Schwemin (Rimini Protokoll) at Souterrain-Berlin, with filmmaker Johann Lurf and painter Florian Schmidt and other artists in the Pinacoteca Vienna.

She is interested in finding independent structural and aesthetic means, via which her work can challenge the power of drawing and painting to influence the observer, the materiality of the line in contrast to the pictorial surface and the possible multidimensionality of both media. The transition between media influences the very core of her work. She examines the potential meaning of drawing and painting in the liminal zones between the drawn line and the painted surface in tangible surroundings,Aesthetica Magazine issue 61, Oct/Nov 2014 (pp 141) ISSN 1743-2715 as she does between an artistic mind-set and a sphere of social activity. Thematically, her work deals with concepts such as presence and permeability, visibility and invisibility, and disappearance, all from the most variant perspectives. These aspects are examined as moments of motion, as moments of appearance and acts of concealment. Maria Hinze's work is concerned with the relationship between humans and their surroundings. The human body functions as a physical medium for storing both the conscious and subconscious. Hinze comprehends herself as a storage medium for images of a world of language and form, which is rooted in the subconscious and, as such, precedes her own thought structures – intangible knowledge is translated into language and tangible space.

It is open as a historic house museum and events venue, and is owned by the government of Walker County, Georgia. The house was built c.1836 and expanded c. 1895-1910. Colonial Revival modifications were done c.1935. with Description of the House The Marsh-Warthen House was built in 1836, by Spencer Stewart Marsh and his wife, Ruth Terrell Brantley Marsh. The original house consisted of four rooms over four rooms with wide hallways running through the center of the building on both the upper and lower levels. A large porch with square columns was constructed on the south side of the house; a second-story balcony with a door from the upstairs hall was built over this porch. The original kitchen was in the basement, and food was brought up to the main level by a dumb waiter. The kitchen remained in the basement until about 1900, when the grandson of Spencer Marsh, Spencer Marsh Warthen, built a two-story wing on the northeast side of the house. The lower level of the new wing contained the kitchen and a large pantry, while the upper level was used as servants' quarters.Forester, C. B., \\"Descendants of Spencer and Ruth Marsh.\\" Personal interviews. 2003. Marsh-Warthen House The Marsh-Warthen House is an early Greek Revival-style home and is significant as an example of a Georgian-type house with original Greek Revival-style and later Colonial Revival-style details. According to Georgia's Living Places: Historic Houses in their Landscaped Settings, a statewide context, the Georgian house was popular in Georgia's towns and cities from the early years of the 19th century well into the 20th century. The Greek Revival style, which was found more often in towns and cities, was popular from the 1840s through the 1860s. The Marsh-Warthen house is thus an early example of the Greek Revival style of architecture on the Georgia frontier. It retains many of its original stylistic features including overall symmetrical massing, low hipped roof, central-hall plan, and architectural details including prominent square Doric columns and a front door surrounded by narrow sidelights and a rectangular line of transom lights above. Due to the presence of African-American slaves on the property, the early construction date of the house, and the tradition of using slave labor in the antebellum period in Georgia, it is likely that Mr. Marsh's slaves were involved in the construction of the house.U. S. Department of Interior, National Park Service, NPS Form 10-900. Marsh-Warthen House National Register of Historic Places Application, November 23, 2004. Spencer Marsh's youngest daughter, Sarah Adaline, married Nathaniel Green Warthen in 1859. After living on a plantation in McLemore's Cove (northwest of La Fayette) and retreating to the old Warthen home place in Warthen, Washington County, Georgia, during the Civil War, the Warthens and their children moved into the Marsh-Warthen House, probably about 1875, after the death of Mr. Spencer Marsh. Their son, Spencer Marsh Warthen, was responsible for the Colonial Revival elements including the roof dormers added to the house in the early 20th century and for the two additions to the house. According to Georgia's Living Places, the Colonial Revival-style elements were often simply added onto buildings of other styles. The Colonial Revival style was very popular in Georgia from the 1890s through the 1940s. Marsh Family Business After settling in Northwest Georgia, Mr. Marsh established a mercantile business on the town square and acquired large tracts of farm and timber landsWert, Addie Augusta (1984). Spencer Stewart Marsh. In Walker County Georgia Heritage 1833-1983 (p. 280). Dallas: Taylor Publishing Co. In 1845, Spencer Marsh, Andrew Perry Allgood, and W.K. Briers organized the Trion Factory Company, the first cotton mill in Northwest Georgia. The mill was built on the Chattooga River about twelve miles south of La Fayette. Andrew P. Allgood, who married the eldest Marsh daughter, Mary Ann, and Spencer Marsh were some of the wealthiest men in northwest Georgia. By 1857, they each had equal interest in Trion Factory. The factory operated under the name of Marsh & Allgood by the eve of the Civil War. Today the Trion Mill operates under the name of Mount Vernon Mills.Baker, Robert S. \\"Chattooga County, A Story of a County and Its People\\". Roswell, Georgia: WH Wolfe Associates, 1988. The Marsh Family Mr. Marsh was born in Chatham County, North Carolina, on November 25, 1799, and was the son of William Marsh, a soldier in the American Revolution for whom the William Marsh chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (in La Fayette, Georgia) is named. About 1835, Marsh moved his family to \\"Chattooga,\\" Georgia. Soon after his arrival, the name of the small settlement was changed to La Fayette.Dennis, Stephen Neal (2010). A Proud Little Town: LaFayette, Georgia, 1835-1885, La Fayette, GA: Walker County, Georgia Governing Authority, p. 96. In 1835, Northwest Georgia was still Cherokee territory and remained so until 1838, when the Native Americans of the area were removed and settled west of the Mississippi River. By 1835, the Cherokees were a friendly, peaceful people, and the Marsh family befriended many of them.Sartain, James Alfred. \\"History of Walker County, Georgia,\\" Dalton, Georgia: The A. J. Showalter Company, 1972, original year 1932 Ruth and Spencer Marsh reared their six children in this large, imposing house, and sometimes rented rooms to boys who wished to live in La Fayette during the week and attend Chattooga Academy, the brick school just south of the Marsh House. One of the boys who lived with the Marsh family was John B. Gordon. Years later, Gordon became a well-known and respected person in Georgia and throughout the South. During the American Civil War, Gordon served as one of Robert E. Lee's officers and was the officer Lee chose to surrender what was left of the Army of Northern Virginia. After the war, Gordon served the people of Georgia as governor and U.S. Senator. In 1863, when the Civil War moved into Northwest Georgia, the Marsh family moved south to Cassville, Georgia, in what is today Bartow County, Georgia. General Braxton Bragg plotted his strategy September 17–19, 1863, for the Battle of Chickamauga under an old oak tree which stood just to the south of the Marsh House in front of the Chattooga Academy. While the family was away, the house was occupied by Union troops and was a focal point during The Battle of La Fayette in June 1864. After the war, the family returned home to find that all of their furniture and household items had been taken. The floors were blood- soaked and marked with hoof prints. Many bullets were found in the outer walls of the house and there were bullet holes in the glass around the south upstairs outer door. The house remained in the same family for more than one hundred fifty years. The last member of the family to occupy the home was Miss Addie Augusta Wert, great-granddaughter of Spencer and Ruth Marsh. Museum The Patrick R. Clements family owned the house from 1992-2002 when it was purchased by the Walker County, Georgia, Historical Society. In the summer of 2003, the house was purchased by Walker County from the Walker County Historical Society. Under an agreement with the county, the Walker County Historical Society manages the building, and through the Marsh House Community Task Force (Board of Trustees), raises funds for the operation and maintenance of the building and surrounding grounds. The Marsh House is open to the public from 1:30 until 3:30 on Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday afternoons. The Marsh House aims to serve as a major educational and cultural institution in Northwest Georgia and the greater Chattanooga area by providing in-depth tours led by trained interpreters, by offering historically accurate reenactments, by working with local schools to offer curriculum-targeted instructional experiences, and by hosting exhibits and events which promote understanding of Northwest Georgia's diverse peoples and history. More than 10,000 persons visit the house and grounds each year, many as a continuation of their visit to the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Parkwhich is only 12 miles away.Boyle, D. P. (November 17, 2016). Marsh House Board of Directors' Meeting Minutes, Minute Book on file in the Marsh House office, 308 N. Main Street, La Fayette, GA. The Marsh House Museum Board also manages the Chattooga Academy for educational programs across the lawn which Spencer Marsh helped to found and which is the oldest brick school house in Georgia. Significance of the Marsh-Warthen House The house is significant in the area of European settlement of North America. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the Cherokee Nation included the area that would become Walker County. The Georgia Land Lottery of 1832 followed by the removal of the Cherokee by the federal government opened the area to white settlement. Spencer Marsh moved his family to La Fayette c.1835 from Newton County, Georgia, and became one of the pioneers of the county. During the early years of his life on the frontier, Mr. Marsh had many dealings with his Cherokee neighbors and was given the name Estachee by the Cherokee Indians. Marsh House history notes that one of his servants at the Marsh House, Ninatoya, was a Cherokee woman who was forced west on the Trail of Tears in the late 1830s. The home he built c. 1836-1837 is one of the few surviving houses from that period of early white settlement. The Marsh-Warthen House is important to an understanding of social and cultural history due to Spencer Marsh's efforts to promote the welfare of the La Fayette area. As a community and business leader in La Fayette and Walker County, Marsh encouraged progress in the economic, educational, and religious life of the community. In addition to his influence as a local merchant Mr. Marsh helped organize the Trion Factory (in Chattooga County, south of La Fayette) in 1845, the first cotton mill in northwest Georgia. He served as an Inferior Court justice and as a state senator. He also donated the land for the Chattooga Academy (located just south of the Marsh-Warthen House and listed in the National Register on February 15, 1980) and served as a trustee for the academy and for the La Fayette Female Academy established soon thereafter. Mr. Marsh was an active member and major funder of the First Baptist Church of La Fayette, where his family and slaves attended. The Marsh household was a typical wealthy Southern household during the mid-19th century. The family coexisted and interacted closely with the African-American slaves who lived on the property and later with the African- American servants who lived in the main house. Spencer Marsh was thus a prominent local example of the kind of enterprising pioneer who helped settle Georgia's westward-moving frontier during the late 18th and early 19th Centuries through his contributions to the developing community's social, economic, and cultural life.

Shot in Iraqi Kurdistan, the film is co-produced Montreal's Périphéria Productions, Germany's MitosFilm and the National Film Board of Canada. The film was conceived and named for a woman, Gulîstan, who'd been a role model for the director in her adopted home in Montreal, until she left to fight with the PKK. Akyol went to Iraq in 2010 in an unsuccessful effort to find her and make a film about her. Unable to locate Gulîstan, she did find women who knew her and the focus of the documentary shifted to telling Gulîstan's story through their memories of her. But when she returned to Iraq to film in 2014, some of those women were now dead while others were in combat, and so the focus of the film shifted yet again, to documenting the experiences of women like Gulîstan.

The creek begins in Elk Valley, in the Siskiyou Wilderness of the Six Rivers National Forest in Del Norte County. It flows southwest, receiving several major tributaries including the East Fork, Crescent City Fork, Nickowitz Creek, Slide Creek and the West Fork. It flows into the Klamath River in Humboldt County, upstream from where the Klamath empties into the Pacific Ocean. The Blue Creek watershed covers about and is considered one of the most pristine areas in the Klamath River Basin. The area is within the historic territory of the Yurok people. During the 19th and early 20th centuries the Blue Creek valley was subject to intensive logging, but the area has begun to recover with recent conservation efforts by the Yurok Tribe. Blue Creek is a critical migration point for salmon and steelhead in the Klamath River watershed. Summer water temperatures in Blue Creek are typically lower than the main stem Klamath; migrating fish can lower their body temperature considerably by resting in Blue Creek, increasing their chances of survival upriver. Blue Creek itself, with no dams or diversions, also provides good spawning habitat for these fish. The confluence of Blue Creek with the Klamath River is directly downstream from the original planned site of Ah Pah Dam, a massive structure proposed in the 1950s which would have diverted the Klamath River to Southern California.

The old engines consumed 7500–8000 litres of fuel each year, with the average speed of ~2 km/h. According to the manufacturer Visedo Oy, the new electric engines should consume around 3-4 kW/h, depending on the season. The average speed will remain unchanged and the ferry will still have dual motors for redundancy. Each of the two engines consists of a DC/DC converter to increase the voltage from the batteries, and a permanent magnet motor drive to transform the electrical signal into mechanical energy. Both of the two motors can also be used simultaneously if more power is needed due to e.g. ice conditions. The new system is also eight tonnes lighter than the diesel engines and hydraulic motor it has replaced.Electrification of the Föri. Tutka. Electrification of the Föri. Turun Sanomat.

Xemnu Xemnu the Living Titan, also known as Xemnu the Hulk, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Xemnu is an alien who has attempted to conquer the Earth several times. The character first appeared in the story \\"I Was a Slave of the Living Hulk!\\" in Journey into Mystery #62, and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Xemnu first appeared when his starship crash-landed on Earth after running out of fuel.Journey into Mystery (November 1960). Marvel Comics. Reprinted: Marvel Monsters: Devil Dinosaur (2005) #1 Summary When revived by the human Joe Harper, Xemnu reveals that he was a criminal who had been exiled into space for crimes against the rest of the universe, and had escaped a prison planet and fled to Earth. Xemnu then used telepathy to dominate Harper's mind and then the minds of every other human on Earth. He forced them to build him a new starship so that he could return home. As he departs, he releases Harper from his telepathic domination. Harper sabotages the ship's electrical systems, shocking Xemnu into a coma-like state. As the alien flew off, his mind control faded, and his former servants forgot that he had ever existed. Xemnu used telekinesis to direct an asteroid to strike his ship so that it would be knocked onto a course back to Earth. After crashing down on Earth a second time, the weakened Xemnu was taken into a circus sideshow. As he took control of the town where the circus was located, Joe Harper followed Xemnu's trail and confronts the alien. Xemnu attempts to disintegrate Harper, but Harper used a mirror to reflect the alien's psychic power back at it, and Xemnu's body was destroyed. Xemnu then traveled through space in a non- corporeal form, and over the years learned that his home planet had been wiped out by a plague. He returned to Earth, possessing the body of an astronaut named Richmond Wagner to gain a physical form. When the space shuttle arrived on Earth, Xemnu used his human host's popularity and his own telepathy to become the host of a children's television series. He used his mental power to place Earth's children under his thrall, planning to abduct them to repopulate his home world, only to be detected by Doctor Strange. Strange and his ally Namor the Sub-Mariner were defeated by the alien, but Xemnu was in turn beaten by the Hulk.Marvel Feature #3. Marvel Comics. Xemnu then took possession of Amos Moses, mayor of small-town Plucketville in an attempt to kidnap the townspeople of Plucketville to repopulate his home planet. The newly formed Defenders (Doctor Strange, the Hulk, the Sub-Mariner and the Valkyrie) fought him, thus preventing him from using the townspeople to construct another starship.Defenders #12.

Xemnu took mental control of the Los Angeles- based hero Wonder Man using him to attack his ally, the Thing. The heroes eventually defeated Xemnu, and he fled in a starship.Marvel Two-In-One #78. Marvel Comics. Later, deep in space, Xemnu infiltrates the spacecraft-haulage craft owned by Ulysses Solomon Archer. He takes over the enclosed area of the Star Stop Diner and confronts a pregnant woman known as Mary McGrill. He plans to genetically alter her child to make it one of his own race. He is opposed by Razorback, Archer, She-Hulk and everyone else at the diner, but they are easily knocked out by his psychic powers.\\"Star Truck\\", Sensational She Hulk #6 (October 1989), Marvel Comics She-Hulk awakens ahead of the others and finds that Xemnu is attempting to turn her into a \\"She-Xemnu.\\" Ultimately, Xemnu is defeated and given over to a powerful humanoid alien named Big Enilwen.

He returns to confront She-Hulk again, this time to sell her into slavery. This time he is defeated by a large monkey wrench to the head, wielded by She-Hulk's friend Louise Mason. Xemnu reappeared as one of Space Phantom's kidnapped bodies in Beyond!. He appeared in Annihilation: Conquest as one of the Phalanx select. Xemnu later returned to Earth and fought Red Hulk after Woodgod's defeat. During that time, Impossible Man uses his magic to combine Hulk and Red Hulk into the Compound Hulk which fights Xemnu's minion Kluh (a smart version of the Gray Hulk) and overpowers it.Hulk Vol. 2 #30. Marvel Comics. Xemnu later appeared on Monster Isle when Shadowcat and Magik appeared to look for a mutant girl named Bo.

Xemnu later appears alongside Rocket Raccoon.Rocket Raccoon Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Monsters Unleashed\\" storyline, Xemnu is among the monsters seen falling from the sky near San Diego.Monsters Unleashed Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics. Xenmu appears again, currently living on Monster Isle. He is approached by Roxxon CEO Dario Agger as part of his plan to ruin the Hulk's public image and replace him with his own Hulk. Augmented with cybernetics, Xenmu appears to save citizens from several giant internal parasites that the Hulk accidentally unleashed which led to his Devil Hulk persona changing to the Savage Hulk persona. Knowing that the media is watching, Xenmu uses his powers to subtly take control of the viewers by asking if they remember him. While this is going on, he allows the Hulk to fight him so that he can purposely lose control of the parasites to worsen Hulk's public image. After being saved by Absorbing Man, Hulk leaves as Xenmu's powers have begun to influence those who witnessed the event on screen, as shown with one of Hulk's current allies, Dr. Charlene McGowan, whose recount of meeting Daredevil for the first time now changed to meeting Xenmu. In Bruce Banner's mind, the Savage Hulk persona comments that he can't fight Xemnu's hypnosis. The Green Scar persona reappears and states that he can. Minotaur discovered Xemnu had transformed the people he fed on into Xemnu/human hybrid minions. Upon objecting to this, Xemnu consumed Minotaur and transformed him into a deformed Xemnu/Minotaur hybrid creature unable to speak. Hulk in his Green Scar persona managed to slay Xemnu enough to break the mind control.The Immortal Hulk Vol. 1 #28-33. DC Comics. Thanks to his alien genetic structure, Xemnu possesses great superhuman strength, almost comparable to the She-Hulk's even at his present smaller size. Xemnu also possesses superhuman stamina and durability, and he has a gifted intellect with advanced knowledge of genetics. His main resource lies in his enormous, extraordinary psionic abilities, including telepathy, hypnosis, possession, and levitation. These abilities enable him to effortlessly control millions or even billions of minds at a time, immediately induce unconsciousness in crowds of people, or even put mental blocks in the mind of Doctor Strange, the \\"Sorcerer Supreme\\" of the Marvel Universe, although the Hulk has proved immune to Xemnu's psionic possession. He can also project psionic concussive blasts of tremendous power, sufficient to stagger even the Hulk, animate unliving objects, including asteroids, and he can create personal \\"atmo-spheres\\", a protective sphere of psionic energy, which he can use to fly with himself in it. If destroyed, he can inhabit another living being and transform it into a smaller (11 ft) copy of his original body. He is highly adept in his native technology, and has been capable of engineering genetic monstrosities capable of challenging even Hulk's might, or using a machine that turns humans into members of his species, including transforming She-Hulk into a \\"She-Xemnu\\". =Xemnu in other media= Xemnu appears in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode, \\"The Strongest One There Is\\", voiced by Fred Tatasciore. This variation is much taller and stronger than the Hulk. He is interested in challenging local fighters and delivers a challenge, via hologram, to fight the Hulks - all except Rick. Seeing it as pointless, Hulk moves to reject but Rick accepts on behalf of the entire team. His colleagues lose. Feeling guilty, Rick tries one more time and manages to defeat Xemnu. Xemnu declares his journey for a skilled fight over and bonds with Rick over video games and doughnuts. Six years after the release of the original comic, the fictitious alien Xemnu (under the barely altered name Xenu or Xemu) would become a central part of the secret teachings of the new religion of Scientology.Susan, Raine (2017). \\"Astounding History: L.

Mike Gundy stated about the crash, “Honestly, the last thing that anybody wants to do, really, is play a game.” ESPN's Joe Tessitore said before the game during their broadcast, \\"The Oklahoma State Cowboys have arrived in Ames, Iowa with heavy hearts. These coaches and players are dealing with tragic news. Women's basketball head coach Kurt Budke and assistant coach Miranda Serna were killed in a plane crash last night. In moments, another kickoff arrives before this undefeated team while an entire university community is overcome with grief.\\" Before the game, Jack Trice Stadium observed a brief moment of silence for the lives lost in the plane crash. The game The Cowboys raced to a 24–7 lead early into the third quarter. Iowa State scored 17 unanswered points to tie the game, but quarterback Jared Barnett was intercepted with 2 minutes to go, and the Cowboys were immediately in field goal range. After the Cyclones forced a 4th-and-1 at the 20-yard line, Oklahoma State opted to try a field goal with just over a minute remaining, but the 37-yard field goal attempt by Oklahoma State kicker Quinn Sharp went wide right, forcing overtime. There, Iowa State scored a touchdown on the first play, while Oklahoma State successfully responded with a touchdown on their own. On the first play of the second overtime, a pass by Heisman candidate Brandon Weeden was tipped and intercepted, giving Iowa State a golden opportunity to pull off the upset, which they did after a series of plays that culminated in running back Jeff Woody running into the endzone. Jubilant Iowa State fans then stormed the field. Oklahoma State racked up 536 yards of total offense, but only gained 60 rushing yards and also committed five turnovers. It was Iowa State's first win over a team ranked sixth or higher in the AP poll. Aftermath and impact The game had a considerable impact on the history of college football. With Oklahoma State's loss, Alabama jumped back to second in the BCS standings, and would remain there for the rest of the season. Despite Oklahoma State throttling their rival No. 13 Oklahoma 44–10 in their final game of the regular season, it was not enough to vault them past Alabama in the BCS standings, as Alabama was controversially awarded the second berth in the BCS National Championship Game opposite LSU. Despite Oklahoma State finishing ahead of Alabama in the computer polls that compiled 1/3 of the BCS formula, Alabama's lead in the human polls was too large to overcome. This created the slimmest margin between two teams in the final BCS Standings. Alabama had an average score of .9419 whereas Oklahoma State had an average score of .9333. More controversy came from the BCS formula of this due to the fact that several head football coaches used their vote in the Coaches Poll to diminish OSU's position by voting them No. 4 or lower; among those to do so were, Alabama head coach Nick Saban, former Big 12, head coach of Missouri Gary Pinkel, Air Force head coach Troy Calhoun, and Stanford head coach David Shaw. Alabama won the National Championship rematch with LSU 21–0. One day after the rematch, the Sporting News reported that the 2012 offseason would be spent building a playoff system. The rematch is cited by some as the catalyst for the movement towards the new College Football Playoff system for determining a consensus national champion in NCAA Division I FBS football, and the catalyst that marked the downfall of Les Miles at LSU. Thus, some has marked this upset as the event that led to Miles' downfall. Citing the plane crash and the subsequent loss, Weeden called it \\"one of the hardest days in Oklahoma State history.\\" 4 years later, Oklahoma State found themselves in a similar situation. They were 9–0 and ranked #8, just 3 wins away from making the College Football Playoff, and were playing on the road against Iowa State. This time, the Cowboys prevailed, ironically coming back from a 24–7 deficit to win 35–31. However, the Cowboys would lose their final 2 regular season games, and as a result did not make the College Football Playoff. References External links * . November 18, 2011 ESPN * .

It was directed by Denny Lu and Tim Stuby, written by Michael Vogel, and produced by Devon Cody. The episode first aired on May 14, 2016, on Discovery Family. In \\"A Hearth's Warming Tail\\", as Ponyville gets ready to celebrate Hearth's Warming (the series' lore equivalent to Christmas) in Twilight Sparkle (Tara Strong)'s castle, Starlight Glimmer (Kelly Sheridan) prefers not to be a part of the festivities. To convince her of the importance of Hearth's Warming, Twilight tells her and Spike (Cathy Weseluck) the tale of Snowfall Frost, a cold- hearted unicorn who despises Hearth's Warming and swears to erase it with her magic. The episode mainly consists of a depiction of the tale itself, with its characters being represented by the main characters of the show. It is adapted from Charles Dickens' classic Christmas novel A Christmas Carol, with Snowfall Frost representing Ebenezer Scrooge and being visited by three spirits who wish to teach her the importance of the holiday. \\"A Hearth's Warming Tail\\" has been described as one of the series' few true \\"musical episodes\\", and features six songs composed by Daniel Ingram and orchestrated by Caleb Chan, with lyrics by Vogel and Ingram. The episode received acclaim from critics and fans; its pacing and songs were widely praised, in particular \\"Luna's Future\\", which marks the first solo song for Princess Luna (from vocals by Aloma Steele). Plot The ponies of Ponyville prepare to celebrate Hearth's Warming together in Twilight Sparkle's castle. However, when Twilight Sparkle and Spike ask Starlight Glimmer if she is ready to celebrate, she says she \\"might just skip it\\", as she considers it \\"a day dedicated to presents and candy\\". Twilight tries to explain Hearth's Warming is mostly about spending time with friends and family, but Starlight is not interested; to convince her, Twilight decides to read \\"A Hearth's Warming Tale\\". The tale takes place during a Hearth's Warming many years ago, where a cold-hearted unicorn named Snowfall Frost considers her fellow ponies' merrymaking to be a waste of time, and is dubious of the origins of the holiday, when ponies joined in friendship to drive back the Windigos that were causing the winter storms. After granting her assistant Snowdash a holiday leave by mistake, Snowfall decides to use her magic to erase the holiday However, the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Past interrupts her; to change her mind about the holiday, the spirit travels with her to Snowfall's own childhood. Snowfall witnesses her younger self enjoying the holiday before being told by her professor the holiday's origin is a lie, and in order to become the powerful unicorn she wants to be, she has to spend Hearth's Warming studying instead of celebrating. Feeling hurt and helpless, Snowfall snaps, disregards Hearth's Warming altogether and isolates herself from all the other ponies from this point on to focus only on her work. The adult Snowfall wakes up in her home back in her time, only to be visited by the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents, who teaches her the importance of presents is the pleasure to give to and receive from loved ones; she shows her the other ponies enjoying their time together and making fun of Snowfall's seriousness. Snowfall suddenly finds herself in a deserted land covered in snow, where she encounters the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Yet to Come, who tells her Snowfall will succeed in erasing Hearth's Warming, thus permitting the return of the Windigos and turning Equestria into a land of eternal snow. Horrified by the consequences her spell would have, Snowfall awakens once again in the present, realizing the future can still be avoided. She joins Snowdash and the other ponies in their celebration of Hearth's Warming, understanding the importance of the holiday. Finishing the story, Twilight encourages Starlight to join them in the celebration; she does, and all of Ponyville celebrates Hearth's Warming together.

Production and promotion The opening song of the episode, \\"Hearth's Warming Eve Is Here Once Again\\", was first previewed at the 2016 New York Toy Fair. According to writer Michael Vogel, in the original version of the script, the character of Jacob Marley from A Christmas Carol was planned to appear, and would have been represented by Discord; this was cut to save time for rest of the plot. Also in the episode's original draft, Princess Luna's Spirit of Hearth's Warming Yet to Come did not have a song due to a lack of space in the episode's running time, but the \\"directors and creative team all realized she needed one\\". The animation sequences for the songs \\"Hearth's Warming Eve Is Here Once Again\\", \\"Say Goodbye to the Holiday\\", and \\"Luna's Future\\" were storyboarded by Sabrina Alberghetti. Reception The episode received acclaim. Daniel Avarez of Unleash the Fanboy highly praised the episode, giving it a perfect rating of 10 out of 10. He praised the \\"fantastic songs\\", the episode itself as \\"A solid Christmas tale\\", as it \\"takes the overused Christmas Carol plot but manages to be great anyway.\\" He was also receptive of the use of songs to enhance the story rather than distract, as well as the story arc of Starlight's redemption. Don't Hate the Geek called the episode \\"amazing\\", describing Luna's appearance as the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Yet to Come and her song as show stealers. Daniel Ingram was nominated for a 2017 Leo Award for his work on this episode for \\"Best Musical Score in an Animation Program or Series\\". Home media release All songs in the episode (excluding \\"Hearth's Warming Eve is Here Once Again (Reprise)\\") were released as a part of the 2016 physical and digital re-release of the 2015 compilation album It's a Pony Kind of Christmas.

Tevis (December 5, 1799 – April 21, 1880) was a pioneer educator of women from Kentucky. After teaching for several years in Virginia, she founded the Science Hill Female Academy in Shelbyville and led the institution to gain a national reputation for excellence. Teaching her students math and science, rather than how to be accomplished seamstresses, Tevis prepared young women for colleges. Early life Julia Ann Hieronymous was born on December 5, 1799, near Winchester, Clark County, Kentucky to Mary \\"Polly\\" (née Bush) and Pendleton Hieronymus Her father's family were German Methodists and her mother's family were English Baptists Hieronymous was the oldest daughter and second child in the family. Though she began her schooling in Clark County, studying with Mr. Pettichord, when she was seven years old, the Hieronymous family moved to Winchester, Virginia, as they felt schooling opportunities would be better. She attended the female academy there until 1813, when they moved again to the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D. C.. In Georgetown, Hieronymous studied drawing, embroidery, music and French with various private tutors. She enjoyed a privileged life, meeting dignitaries and attending festivities when Congress was in session. During the War of 1812, Hieronymous was barely able to flee during the British attack on Washington. In 1815, she entered a finishing school run by an Englishwoman, Mrs. Stone and graduated when she was nineteen years old. A business reversal of her father, required that Hieronymous earn her own living. Career At twenty, Hieronymous began teaching at a school in Wytheville, Virginia. After teaching a little over a year in Wytheville, she moved to Washington County, Virginia to teach the daughter of a general who lived in Abingdon. When her father died, Hieronymous brought her mother and sister to live with her and took on the responsibility for their care. She converted to Methodism and met a circuit rider, John Tevis, with whom she had a brief courtship. On March 9, 1824, Hieronymous and Tevis married and traveled to Kentucky on their honeymoon trip to see the property his parents had given them as a wedding gift. She convinced John to allow her to open a school in the home. John was appointed to serve the Louisville Station and Tevis, who remained in Shelbyville founded the Science Hill Female Academy on March 25, 1825. In the early days of the school, the Methodist church helped with funding, but it was only nominally associated with the church. Tevis sought to teach her students to have a strong social conscience, but more importantly, she felt that women were as \\"capable of mastering the sciences as were young men\\". While daily attendance at chapel was a requirement, Tevis felt that chemistry and mathematics should take precedence over embroidery and sewing. Famous educators, speakers and writers of the period presented lectures as part of the lyceum circuit for the school and she taught history, math, rhetoric, science, and Latin All teachers she hired were required to have had a classical education and be proficient in languages. Shortly before the school opened, Tevis gave birth to her first child. As she would with its six siblings, she continued working and simultaneously raising her family. A cholera epidemic in the 1830s nearly forced the closure of the school, but Tevis persevered and built the student body from its initial thirty-five pupils to 250 by 1857. Her husband John, had a stroke in 1857 and thereafter suffered from ill-health. He died on January 26, 1861, just prior to the beginning of the Civil War. Around the same time as her husband's death, Tevis' likeness was featured in the Nashville-based Home Circle newspaper's February 1861 issue. It is unknown if the engraving published in the Home Circle was taken from the portraits painted of the Tevises by Charles Bond, probably in 1860. Tevis believed in the emancipation of slaves and was not a supporter of the Confederacy, which was shocking to her neighbors. As most of her students also came from Southern states, though she had pupils from throughout the country, her kindness and reputation allowed her to keep the school open during the conflict. Several students from Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi, remained with her through the duration of the war without means to contact or return to their families. She cared for them as if they were her own children, until the war was over and normal travel was resumed. In 1875, the school held its fifty-year reunion and alumni from three generations came to pay tribute to Tevis. Though she had begun relinquishing some of her duties, she continued to instruct Bible classes and chemistry. In 1878, Tevis published her autobiography, Sixty Years in a School-room. The following year, she sold Science Hill to Dr. Wiley Taul Poynter and on her birthday a large \\"founders celebration\\" was held in her honor at the school. It was attended by former students, teachers, local dignitaries and friends. Death and legacy Tevis died on April 21, 1880 at Shelbyville, Kentucky and she was buried in the Grove Hill Cemetery of Shelbyville. The month after her death, her former students and children erected a cemetery marker to her memory. A statue in her honor was erected in 1885 in Shelbyville. The school Tevis founded maintained a reputation as one of the premier college preparatory schools of the South, training some 3,000 young women over its 114-year history until 1939. In 1939, Rachel M. Varble published Julia Ann a work of juvenile fiction based on the diaries of Tevis. Tevis' private papers and those of Science Hill are housed at the Filson Historical Society in Louisville, Kentucky and contain letters, papers and records of the school from its founding through 1975. The Filson Historical Society is also in possession of the portraits painted by Bond. In 1975 the school was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, because of its significance as both a school and a historical building.

The last painting of Bingham's Election Series, The Verdict of the People tells the end of the story represented in the series. Within this painting, Bingham hid several political motives and ideas similar to the rest of the Election Series. Historians say the painting depicts public reaction to a likely proslavery candidate's election victory. Completed in 1854, the work covered issues of slavery, temperance, and a representative government, subjects that had gone from a local to a national level. During the early 1850s, the temperance movement grew and more states were abolishing alcohol. A book by Herman Humphrey, titled Parallel between Intemperance and Slavery, associated the cause of anti-slavery to that of temperance. Bingham showed his view on intemperance and slavery by painting a banner that said, \\"Freedom for Virtue[,] Restriction for Vice.\\" The banner referred to temperance by saying that the vice and alcohol would need to be restricted for the people to be free. The banner then references Bingham's ideas of slavery by using the connection of the temperance movement and the anti-slavery movement to show that Bingham thought negatively about slavery and shared that view with intemperance. When Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Jan. 20, 2017, The Verdict of the People was the chosen painting, hanging on a partition wall behind the ceremonial head table in the Capitol's Statuary Hall.

Accompanied by his cousin Odell, Thompson was recognized with several honors for performances of the old-time style, particularly when the genre was repopularized in the 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, he recorded his first studio albums, consisting of a repertoire rooted in the authentic string band approach.  Biography  Thompson was born in Orange County, North Carolina on December 9, 1918. His father John, a fiddler, and uncle Walter, a banjo player, performed at local square dances and corn shuckings. At seven years-old, when Thompson took up the fiddle himself, he closely observed his father's techniques which were rooted in old-time African tradition. He joined his father and uncle for performances, and later formed his own string band with his older brother Nate and cousin Odell, both of whom were banjo players. Much of the band's repertoire consisted of family songs passed down since before the American Civil War, including \\"Hook and Line\\" and \\"Cindy Gal\\". After serving in a segregated unit during the Second World War and as the popularity for traditional string band music waned, Thompson stopped playing the fiddle to work in a furniture factory as a rip saw operator for 28 years. In 1973, musicologist Kip Lornell, then a recent college graduate, heard rumors about Joe and Odell Thompson's mastery of the old-time style, and urged the duo to make a comeback. Thompson and Odell began performing as the New String Band Duo across the United States and abroad, becoming popular fixtures at folk festivals. Among the notable gigs the duo played at included Carnegie Hall, the National Folk Festival, the Festival of American Fiddle Tunes, and the Tennessee Banjo Institute. In 1989, they recorded the studio album Old-Time Music from the North Carolina Piedmont for the Global Village record label. The duo was awarded the North Carolina Folk Heritage Award in 1991 for preserving black folk music traditions. When Odell died in a car accident in 1994, Thompson pondered quitting music altogether, but recorded the solo album Family Traditions, released on Rounder Records in 1999. A stroke Thompson suffered in 2001 severely impaired the use of his left arm, but after extensive rehabilitation, he returned to playing. Although he lamented at the lack of interest for old-time music, in 2005 he began mentoring the Carolina Chocolate Drops, a modern-day African American string band. In 2007 he received the National Endowment for the Arts fellowship and performed at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.. Thompson was married twice and had one son and six step-children. He died in a nursing home in Alamance County, North Carolina from pneumonia; Thompson was 93 years-old.

Published by Sort of Books, the original edition's dimensions are comparatively small, and the pages have wide margins; it is stylised to appear like an actual visitors book - in keeping with the first, nominal story in the collection - with the inside cover and first page providing columns for names, addresses, comments, etc. In promoting the book, Hannah described how the inspiration for the nominal story came from an incident where, visiting a friend at her home, she was asked to sign a visitors book, a request she found strange given the everyday surroundings. Stories The Visitors Book A young woman's boyfriend calls her a snob when she questions the validity of him owning a visitors book, as he lives in an average terraced house. Flicking through the book, the comments left don't seem to match the surroundings. The Last Boy to Leave After holding a birthday party for her son in the family's new house, an exhausted mother is preparing to relax when she notices that one child still hasn't been picked up. Justified True Belief A woman is stunned when, stopping her car at a red light, she sees what she knows against logic to be a ghost. Relating the story to her incredulous partner, she's prepared to dismiss the experience when she sees another ghost. All the Dead Mothers of My Daughter's Friends Waiting outside school gates to collect her daughter, a woman is approached by a mother who laughs and bemoans the other mothers with her. The conversation draws the woman into a web of cruelty and hatred.

He is best known for providing the score for Nickelodeon's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles revival series since 2012.  Biography  Growing up in Alameda County, Evans spent much of his childhood in Oakland and San Leandro. From an early age he would play his family’s pots and pans as if they were drums, his musical tendencies eventually prompted his parents to purchase a Casio SK-8 keyboard. While a child, Evans saw Return of the Jedi during its theatrical release. He cites the scene in which Admiral Ackbar says, “It’s a trap!” as the moment he decided to become a composer. Evans's composing career began after a chance encounter with artist and animator Ciro Nieli while waiting in line for Star Wars: The Phantom Menace at Mann’s Chinese theater, Evans was offered an opportunity to compose the score for Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!. This was his first professional job as a composer.  Career  On his philosophy towards composing, Evans has stated, “...Writing a song is a bit one-sided as far as perspective goes… When I write for TV and film, it’s not just self expression. I’m trying to convey moods, tones, and emotions from multiple perspectives. There’s a little more ‘extrospection’ required.” Evans describes his influences as vast and wide-ranging, citing Tchaikovsky, Michael Nyman and the Beastie Boys as examples. He has stated that rhythm is a driving force behind his compositions. Evans has also said he typically starts his scores with piano, later adding in or changing the sound to other instruments. Occasionally, he will use unorthodox, non-orchestral instruments in his scores, such as a theremin. In an interview with Patch.com, Evans explained that though he draws on both the original TMNT series as well as the original movies in his score, the latter is a greater source of inspiration. His favorite Ninja Turtle is Donatello. In addition to his work on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Evans has provided the score for Ben 10: Omniverse, Transformers: Animated, The Drinky Crow Show and D.C. Super Friends. Evans was recently featured on BuzzFeed as one of the top composers working in animation today.

Members of the association are drawn mainly from flag manufacturers, collectors, military historians and generally anyone with an interest in flags. SAVA became a member of the International Federation of Vexillological Associations (FIAV) at the 14th International Congress of Vexillology held in Barcelona in 1991 and was the host of the 17th International Congress of Vexillology which was held in Cape Town in August 1997. SAVA produces a Newsletter three times a year which deals with matters of local and international vexillological interest, new flags and matters relating to the running of the association. A more scholastic Journal is also published which deals with a particular research topic related to vexillology in southern Africa and is recognised internationally for its high standard. A series on all South African regimental colours and standards since 1652 has been published which is the most comprehensive record of such flags ever published in South Africa. SAVA has also published a series of Flag Specification Sheets focusing on the flags of Africa. Members of SAVA include the former State Herald of South Africa, Mr Frederick Brownell, who is credited with designing the flag of South Africa and the flag of Namibia. Members of the association have been involved in the design and manufacture of many other flags, particularly municipal, military and corporate flags in Southern Africa. The association has also become an important source of vexillological information and research, including more recently on the internet. Bruce Berry, a founder member, is an editor for Flags of the World, the premier vexillological website and was elected as Secretary General of FIAV in July 2019.  Objectives of the association  According to its constitution, SAVA has the following objectives: * To record and preserve any and all information relating to flags in general and the flags of Southern Africa in particular; * To undertake research and study programmes, organise conferences and symposia, and to exchange information on flags and related matters with similar Associations and Institutions elsewhere in the world; and * To act as an information source for the general public and any interested bodies on all matters pertaining to flags. SAVA is a non-profit, non-political and non-sectarian organisation that under no circumstances will become affiliated or associated with any political or religious body or sect.  Organization flag  The flag of the association is registered with the South African Bureau of Heraldry (Certificate Number 2362 issued on 4 October 1991) and is described as follows: A rectangular blue flag, proportion 3:2; bearing a gold chevron inverted, the tip couped, and in the centre five four-pointed stars, also white, conjoined in cross. Both the base and the tip of each chevron are respectively equal to half of the width of the flag, while the outer point of the stars in fess touch the conjunction of the chevrons. The symbolism of the flag is as follows: At least one of the colours in this flag can be found in the national flag of each country in Southern Africa. The gold inverted chevron (the \\"V\\") alludes to vexillology. The five white stars, which are derived from the Southern Cross, and the white chevron, in turn allude to Southern Africa. (The Southern Cross itself has not been used since it is more closely associated with the flag of Australia and the flag of New Zealand).

Biography Haverich completed his Abitur at the Barntrup Gymnasium in 1972. He studied medicine at the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover (MHH) and graduated in 1978.Medizinische Hochschule Hannover: Prof. Dr. Dr. h. c. A. Haverich (Biography, in German) One year later he received his M.D. title (promotion). During his work as an assistant surgeon he spend time as a research assistant at the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery der Stanford University. In 1985 he became Senior Surgeon (Oberarzt) at the Clinic for Cardiac, Thoracic, and Vascular Surgery at the MHH. His habilitation was completed in 1987. From 1993 to 1996 he worked as the Director for heart and vascular surgery at the Kiel University. In 1996 he returned to the MHH as medical director of Cardiac, Thoracic, Transplant and Vascular Surgery.MHH: Cardiac, Thoracic, Transplant and Vascular Surgery  Work Much of Haverich’s work is focused on tissue engineering and development of implantable organs, specifically for the heart and vascular system. In 2006 his team reported on the transplantation of heart valves in two children (11 and 13 years old) done in 2002; the heart valves originated from donors, were decellularized, and then reseeded with autologous stem cells so that they would continue to grow. Haverich's aim is eventually to rebuild the heart by tissue engineering \\"from ourselves\\". In 1996 Haverich founded the Leibniz Research Laboratories for Biotechnology and Artificial Organs (LEBAO) to develop bioengineered tissue for the heart. In 2006 Haverich founded a private company, Corlife, to produce decellularized heart halves. Hypothesis on development of arteriosclerosis In 2017 Haverich presented a new hypothesis about the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis. While the potential role of infection and inflammation had been discussed for decades, Haverich noted that only specific arteries were subject to development of arteriosclerotic plaques. He postulated that the formation of plaques is not from inside the vessel, but the result of inflammation of the feeding vessels (vasa vasorum) of arteries that becoming inflamed compromising the integrity of the arterial wall. He noted that arteries with thin walls not having vasa vasorum do not develop arteriosclerosis. He postulated that the damage by inflamed vasa vasorum leads to cell death within the wall and subsequent plaques formation. Vasa vasorum inflammation can be caused by viruses, bacteria, and fine dust among others.

He previously played for Central F.C. in the Trinidad and Tobago (TT) Pro League, where he led the \\"Sharks\\" to a hat trick of TT Pro League titles (2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17) and back to back CFU Club Championship triumphs in the 2014–15 and 2015-16 seasons. With 13 full international caps to his name, Paul has lined up for the Trinidad and Tobago national football team in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification in CONCACAF. He was also the captain of the Trinidad and Tobago National U-17 and U-20 teams that featured in the 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup and 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Career Paul signed for Central F.C. in January 2014 amidst of flurry of other high profiled Trinidad and Tobago National team players such as Willis Plaza, Ataulla Guerra and Yohance Marshall. He quickly established himself as an integral cog in Central's midfield alongside veteran and TT Pro League legend Marvin Oliver. In his first full season with the \\"Sharks\\" he helped the team secure an unprecedented 9 trophies (5 major trophies and 4 minor trophies) including the club's first TT Pro League and CFU Club Championship titles. Paul also scored the solitary goal in the 2014 First Citizens Cup Final versus North East Stars F.C.. The club lifted the CFU Club Championship title on home soil by defeating arch rival W Connection F.C. 2-1 at the Ato Boldon Stadium. Paul's excellent performances and natural leadership qualities shone through during the season and he was eventually named club captain towards the end of the 2014-15 season. In the following season, Paul once again led the club in retaining the two most prestigious titles: TT Pro League and CFU Club Championship. This proved especially difficult as Paul and his teammates faced off against a hostile Don Bosco of Haiti which was playing at home in the CFU Club Championship semi-final. The score was locked at 1-1 at the end of added extra time in heavy rain but Central F.C. pulled off a 2-4 penalty shootout victory with Paul scoring the winning penalty. This win secured a repeat of the 2015 final versus W Connection which the \\"Sharks\\" ran out comfortable 3-0 winners. Paul was also named the 2016 CFU Club Championship MVP. In a tumultuous 2016-17, Paul was yet again a mainstay at the heart of the \\"Sharks\\" midfield as they made history but claiming a hat trick of TT Pro League titles. He then decided to seek a new challenge at North East Stars F.C. for a brief spell before signing for Pasaquina. International career Leston Paul was born and grew up in Mayaro, Trinidad but attended and represented St. Mary's College (Port of Spain) with distinction. He captained St. Mary's College to the North Zone Intercol title in 2007. In that same year, he led the Trinidad and Tobago National U17 team to the 2007 FIFA U17 World Cup in Korea and played in all 3 matches in a group featuring Germany, Ghana and Colombia. In 2008, he was selected by none other than John Barnes as one of eight Caribbean players to earn a 1-week training stint at Sunderland's Stadium of Light as part of Digicel's Kick Start Clinic. In 2009, the combative midfielder led the Trinidad and Tobago U20 team to the 2009 FIFA U20 World Cup in Egypt where the team was eventually eliminated from Group A featuring the likes of Paraguay, Italy and hosts Egypt. Paul's performances earned him a 4-year scholarship at the University of South Florida (USF) where he excelled and was selected on the Rookie Team of the Year in 2010 and the Big East Third Teams of the Year from 2010 to 2012. Upon graduating from USF in 2012, he returned home to Trinidad and represented hometown club Guaya United F.C. (National Super League) briefly before permanently moving to Central F.C. Paul was awarded his first Trinidad and Tobago Senior International cap by then head coach Stephen Hart in the 2014 Caribbean Cup qualification stage against the Dominican Republic in October 2014. He helped the team to a commanding 6-1 victory and then made appearances throughout the qualification stage. With Paul at the heart of the midfield, T&T; overcame Curaçao and Cuba before being runners-up to Jamaica in the final. He then went on to make further appearances under coach Hart in friendly internationals against Jordan, Peru and Uruguay. He performed well in the contest against Uruguay in May 2016 where the South American giants won 3-1 with Edinson Cavani scoring a brace. His last Senior International Cap came in a 2-0 loss to USA on 8 June 2017 in CONCACAF fifth round (also known as the Hex) in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying.

In 1741 he was in the camp at Genthin and later at Gröningen. On 18 November 1741 he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

Career  Allchurch was born in Jersey, a town in the Channel Islands of the United Kingdom. After graduating from the Kent Institute of Art & Design and the Royal College of Art, London (in sculpture), Allchurch initially used digital editing for emphasizing effects in a singular work. Allchurch specializes in using a variety of contemporary photographs to create a cohesive image of an imaginary place. She has created a multitude of artistic series that create a new contemporary life in classic paintings, or imagined landscapes. By taking a template of the original image, Allchurch digitally superimposes her own photographs to recreate the original work.  Settings  By 2003, she began to graph many photographs of Old Master artworks into a new collage, for example, her Settings, a series of thirteen works. Allchurch cites Settings as “the start of a photographic journey,” in which photographs put a contemporary twist on a traditional landscape. Settings is a series of 12 reimagined architectural works of the European Old Masters, and was in progress from 2003-2006. Allchurch combined photographs from suburban London in order to create collages of these architectural works. Her mastery in lightbox-effects creates the illusion that the combined images are one. Although all of the inspired architecture is from the past, Allchurch kept modern details from the photos—like graffiti, signs and litter—to create a contemporary tone.  Urban Chiaroscuro  Allchurch's 2007 work, Urban Chiaroscuro, further established her reputation as a critically acclaimed artist. Urban Chiaroscuro, which was influenced by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, used photographs of brick, stone, as well as contemporary themes such as graffiti, security cameras, advertisements, and mirrors, to recreate a new 3-dimensional version of his etchings of prison scenes. Urban chiaroscuro is Allchurch's own social commentary on the cold, almost claustrophobic conditions of the prison systems. Some find her work similar to the scenes found in video games.  Tokyo Story  Showcasing her technique of using photographs of contemporary scenes to imitate and redefine classic works, the Tokyo Story(2009) series uses Hiroshige's ukiyo-e wood-block prints of One Hundred Views of Edo to reinterpret and update his work within a contemporary setting. Allchurch was inspired by the natural beauty of Hiroshige's work and was compelled to re-imagine the landscape with a contemporary tone. The modern elements such as billboards, advertisements and litter are meant to create the illusion that the audience is viewing the old landscape in modern times. Allchurch combined her photographs with her template method. She explained: \\"Using the original image as my map and guide, I source and photograph buildings and landscapes, which I use to recreate the scene from a contemporary perspective. Many hundreds of photographs are [for] each image.\\"  Tower of Babel  The Towers of Babel series (2017) features a variety of unique buildings in various cultures. The series was inspired by the Old Testament Biblical story of the Tower of Babel (from the book of Genesis), which depicts a tower that the Babylonians built in an attempt to reach Heaven. There have been numerous artistic interpretations of the Tower of Babel, and in 2017, Allchurch contributed her own interpretation of the famous tower. Through her photo collage technique, Allchurch combined thousands of photographs to depict the Towers of Babel as if it were built in the 21st century. The variation of advertisements, construction vehicles and other contemporary details creates a modern feel. Each image in the series features a different culture, from London to Hong Kong.  Collections  Allchurch's works are held by various private collectors and a complete set of her Tokyo Story series is held at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. 1n 2015 Manchester Art Gallery commissioned Allchurch to make a large image of the city's Albert Square based on a 1910 painting of the same location by Adolphe Valette. The Manchester commission became her first solo feature in a public museum. In 2018 Allchurch showed three works inspired by paintings in the collection of the Sir John Soane's Museum at the Museum in London.

Life Dora Stetter already came into contact with art as a child. After the death of her husband and the retreat to Berlin in 1884, her mother led a drawing school there. Her own artistic career began in 1899-1901 with her studies as a drawing teacher at the Royal School of Art in Berlin. This study secured her life support between 1902 and 1917 as a teacher for private pupils in her own studio in Berlin. In order to develop his own skills towards a free-lancing painter, in 1901/02 followed courses in painting and drawing with :de:Conrad Fehr at the art-school, connected to the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin, and 1902 painting studies with Johannes Heise. In 1903/04 she was a pupil in the Berlin studio of Lovis Corinth. From 1910 she was working with the Romanian Impressionist painter Arthur Segal. From 1911 she was a member of the Verein der Berliner Künstlerinnen ( Society of Berlin women artists). She traveled to Bavaria, Belgium, Denmark and Pomerania between 1902 and 1913. In 1911 Dora Stetter came to Ahrenshoop on the Baltic Sea for the first time. \\"In 1917 Dora Stetter married the artist Fritz Koch- Gotha (1877–1956), gave up her profession as a drawing teacher and took on her role as mother and housewife. To reconcile both – artists and middle-class housewives – was almost impossible at a time when women as artists in general were neither particularly encouraged by their men nor the public.\\"Friedrich Schulz: Ahrenshoop. Künstlerlexikon. p. 105. (See: Further reading) In 1919, her only child, Barbara, was born. The artists' couple Koch [-Gotha and Stetter] came to Fischland every year from 1922, initially as guests of the painter Franz Triebsch. In 1927 the family bought a house in Althagen near Ahrenshoop. Since then, Dora Koch-Stetter has also devoted herself to her own work. After the Berlin studio as well as their apartment and a large part of their works were destroyed in 1944, Althagen became permanent residence. From the 1950s onwards Dora Koch-Stetter was again busy with painting. After the death of Fritz Koch-Gotha in 1956, she devoted herself first to preserving the work of her deceased husband. Through a stroke in 1961 paralyzed on the right side and bedridden, she slowly began to draw and paint again. The diminution of the forces led to the task of painting. Dora Koch-Stetter died on 16 January 1968 in her house in Althagen, today a district of Ahrenshoop. \\"I believe that this Dora Koch-Stetter is the true pearl among the painters who have ever worked in Ahrenshoop, long hidden, not many known today, but of lasting brilliancy.\\" Works (Selection) * Selbstporträt (Self-portrait) (1903) * Dame im Sessel (Lady in the armchair) (1906) * Mädchen mit Puppe (Girl with doll) (1907) * Rotes Haus in Althagen (Red house in Althagen) (1911) * Gartenweg in Althagen (Garden path in Althagen) (1911) * Polnische Schnitterin (Polish reaper) (1913) * Belgische Landschaft (Belgian landscape) (1913) * Brüggekanal (Bruges canal) (1913) * Am Strand von Knoke (On the beach of Knoke) (1913) * Haus Dross in Ahrenshoop (House Dross in Ahrenshoop) (1924/25) The sommer house of Friedrich and Liselotte Dross. * Fritz Koch- Gotha () (1950)Grete Grewolls: Wer war wer in Mecklenburg und Vorpommern. p. 5188 (See: Further reading) See also * List of German women artists Further reading  * References External links Paintings from Dora Koch-Stetter at Artnet German women painters 20th- century German painters 20th-century German women artists Landscape artists Portrait artists People from Bayreuth 1881 births 1968 deaths ","title":"Dora Koch-Stetter"},{"id":"52934741","text":"National Republican Guard may refer to: * National Republican Guard (Portugal) * National Republican Guard (Spain) * National Republican Guard (Italy) * National Republican Guard (The Gambia) See also * Republican National Guard (disambiguation) ","title":"National Republican Guard"},{"id":"52934761","text":"Asmus may refer to: * Asmus, Poland, a village in Poland * Matthias Claudius (1740–1815), a German poet and journalist, known by the penname of Asmus  People with the last name Asmus  * Hermann Asmus (1887–1968), a German art director * James Asmus, an American writer, actor and comedian * John F.

This species is the one most commonly called the Galapagos tomato. It is a wild tomato that evolved on the famous Galapagos Islands, the place where Charles Darwin noted the structural difference between local finches, iguanas, and barnacles, leading him to identify natural selection as a possible source of the origin of species; he prepared a herbarium sheet of the species on his visit. It often gets confused with the other native species, Solanum galapagense, which is similar but slightly different having more bushy smelly foliage and having smaller hairier orange fruits. It also gets confused with natural [Domestic tomato x S. cheesmaniae] hybrids and [Solanum pimpinellifolium x (S. cheesmaniae or S. galapagense)] hybrids because of introduction of domestic tomatoes to the Galapagos Islands, and the presence of Solanum pimpinellifolium on the islands and natural hybridization occurring between them Local extirpation is pervasive among historical populations of Galápagos endemic tomatoes. Although listed as a Least-concern species by the IUCN, recent observations suggest the species may in fact be threatened Local extirpation is pervasive among historical populations of Galápagos endemic tomatoes. This tomato is smaller and more pale than the oldest mainland cultivars, both in its fruit and leaves, but its flavor is similar. It can also be crossbred with it, which has been done professionally to impart its unusual disease resistances to some commercial cultivars. Description Solanum cheesmaniae is a robust, perennial, herbaceous plant that at first grows erect, later lying. It reaches up to high; its foliage reaches a similar diameter. It is often found in rocky coastal sites. The grayish stems become woody at the base and reach a diameter of . The dense, velvety coat consists of white, single row, non-glandular trichomes up to 0.5 mm in length and occasional short-row, glandular trichomes with four or eight digits. There are varying breeds of galapagos tomato, which can be differentiated by one to four-pinnate leaves, and habits of growing on the shore or inland.Relationships, origin, and diversity of Galápagos tomatoes: implications for the conservation of natural populations Distribution and ecology The species occurs on the islands of Galapagos, 500 miles west of Ecuador. They grow in extremely wet, rocky areas from sea level to up to several hundred feet. The flowers and fruits appear consistently throughout the year, but there is a noticeable increase in flowering between September and October.

The process was largely implemented in the 1950s. It was gradual and involved reorganizing government agencies and expanding educational facilities at selected high schools and colleges. Nigerianisation became important as Nigeria marched towards independence, the Nigerian Council of Ministers and the House of Representatives both supported the idea of a Nigerian control of the Public Service' senior positions such as permanent secretaries. Background Colonial service In the 1930s, the Colonial Service administration became unified and controlled from London, rendering it the image of a unified empire. A consequence of the unified system was the recruitment and placement of officers into the Nigeria service was processed through the London office while little deliberation was considered for suitable Africans. In Nigeria, the structure of the colonial machine placed emphasis on indirect rule and the placement of expatriate Residents, Divisional Officers and administrators to the provinces where they were in direct contact with citizens. The unified system also created a bureaucratic secretariat with expatriate secretaries responsible for communications with London. Though both offices were inundated with constant transfer of personnel and lack of funds, many of the positions in the secretariat were filled with expatriates from other colonies while most of the governing functions were done by residents in the provinces. By the beginning of World War II, Nigeria had a large bureaucratic service manned by expatriates. But the quality of service provided by the expatriates began to dwindle, a situation aggravated by among other things low pay, restriction of expatriate participation in the war effort, constant transfers, separation from families and the increasing complexity of governance not matched by the qualifications. After the war, a salary commission was instituted to consider the welfare of civil servants. The commission encouraged the use of the word ‘Senior Posts’ for administrative positions in the secretariat and provinces which were dominated by Europeans and formerly known as 'European posts'. The new designation also came with expatriation pay and allowances while the 'African posts' was referred to as junior posts but had little benefits. Since the 1930s, the number of Nigerians of Southern origin who were mission school graduates was increasing. The educated Africans including some on the civil service and the nationalists began to clamor for increased involvement of Nigerians in the senior positions of administration. Nigerianisation was shaped as a fight against discrimination and colonialism. Prior to 1948, the senior positions were dominated by expatriates though a few Africans managed to be promoted. Colonial officials in London and in Nigeria had limited the advancement and recruitment of educated Africans into senior positions with the exception of a few such as Henry Rawlingson Carr and Joseph McEwen. In the middle of 1948, out of a total of 3,786 senior positions, 245 were Africans, 1,245 vacant and the remainder expatriates. To include more Africans in public service, the first step usually began with commission of enquiries into the nature and requirement of public service. 1948-1952 The first commission was the Foot Commission of Enquiry, saddled with the task of finding ways to recruit suitable and qualified Nigerians to work in public service. The report of the commission provided progressive recommendations. Hugh Foot's commission recommended the creation of a Public Service Board to work in conjunction with the Civil Service Commission to implement its proposals. During the same year, a revamped constitution established regionalized government in Nigeria limiting the implementation of Foot's proposals. The new system also increased the level of participation in political development by educated Nigerians who opted not to join the civil service. A few years after the commission published its report, the regional political leadership in Southern Nigeria were not convinced that enough qualified Nigerians were being recruited into the civil service. This sentiment varied in the predominantly Islamic North where indirect rule was a tool of governance, Western education was limited and thus the number of qualified Northerners were few. The Northern regional government feared that progressive recruitment of Nigerians into the civil service cadre will lead to marginalization of Northerners. Some of the recommendations of the Foot Commission *That no Non-Nigerian should be recruited into a government position if a Nigerian is qualified and suitable. *That public service boards with non-official majorities should be appointed to select candidates for senior service posts and for scholarships and training schemes. *That departmental boards should be appointed to make recommendations for promotions into senior service and for selection of training with the view of promotion into senior positions, *That scholarships and training awards should be expanded *Additional scholarships should be made for women *That local training facilities should be enlarged Nigerianisation: 1952-1960 Progress in the Southern region In early 1952, a new Council of Ministers was inaugurated, the first in the country to be dominated by Nigerians. The ministers chose Nigerianisation as a key policy to pursue. In March 1952, the council appointed a commission jointly led by Simeon Adebo and Sydney Phillipson to review the process of the recruiting more Nigerians into the civil service. In the commission's report released a year later, it noted that between 1948 and 1953, the number of Africans in senior positions increased from 245 to 685 but also the number of expatriates increased from 2,296 to 2,984. In conclusion, the commission gave far reaching recommendations. The report's title was \\"The Nigerianisation of the Civil Service\\", this was the first time the expression, Nigeriansation of the civil service was publicly used in the country. Among the recommendations of the commission include: advertisement of vacancies to Nigerians abroad, promotion based on merit but excluding non-Nigerians on secondment, that non-Nigerians should not be recommended to fill newly created posts or posts in new departments, that contract terms should be the first option in recruiting non- Nigerians. However, just like the previous commission new political developments impacted the full implementation of the proposals. In 1954, the Lyttleton Constitution displaced the Macpherson Constitution of 1951. The new constitution changed the civil service from a unified structure into a regionalized one. As a result, the two Southern regional governments, led by Awolowo’s Action Group and Azikiwe’s NCNC aggressively promoted the training and recruitment of Nigerians into the regional civil service. Many Africans in the Federal service were heavily sought after by the regional governments. This led to progressive Nigerianisation within the regional governments of the South but a depletion of Africans in the Federal service. Progress in the Federal service The regional governments in the south hastened the process of Nigerianisation, in 1955, the Western government reduced the recruitment of pensionable expatriates while newly trained Nigerians from colleges overseas were appointed into senior positions. At the Federal level, progress began later. In August 1955, the House of Representatives called on the Council of Ministers to present proposals towards the Nigerianisation of the civil service. In March 1956, the council presented before the House, Sessional Paper No.4 of 1956, a statement policy on Nigerianisation. The council proposed that a new position, the Office of the Nigerianisation Officer be created and increased level of post-secondary school training of Nigerians so as to meet the needs of the public service. To ensure the success of the proposals three training programmes were to be instituted. Senior Training, Intermediate Training and Preliminary Training. Three major governmental bodies were charged with implementing the process: the Public Service Commission, Scholarship Board and the establishment office. Each ministry was mandated to keep tabs on departmental needs and Nigerians in training who could fit the staff needs. The process also involved recruitment of Nigerian students in U.K. for administrative positions at home. While the number of Nigerians in senior positions was 786 out of a total of 5,125, in 1961 the figure had increased to 3,030 out of a total of 5,133. By 1965, the process of Nigerianisation had virtually been completed in the Federal Service and at the regional levels. =Foreign service= The training of diplomats to man overseas mission was contained in Sessional Paper No 11 of 1956. A selected number of administrative officers were sent abroad for training in preparation of Nigerians independence and establishing Nigerian overseas embassies. =Military= As part of the transition towards independence, the control of the armed forces was transferred from the army council to the office of the Governor-General. Expatriate military officers were now placed under the control of Nigerians and given a maximum period of 3 years of secondment before returning home. In 1959, there were 297 officers in the military with 37 of them Nigerians. The Nigerian cadre in 1959, were 3 majors, 6 captains and 28 subalterns. By 1960, more officers were planned to be commissioned and others promoted into the major and captain ranks. From 1956 to 1961 British non-commissioned officers were gradually decreased and at which point the remaining officers were those with technical skills. Cadetship was established in select secondary schools to discover potential recruits who could qualify for officer positions. About seventeen yearly cadets were recruited yearly and sent to train abroad as potential officers. Northernization Nigerianisation was slow to materialize in the Northern region due to a limited number of qualified graduates from the region. Administration in the North was through indirect rule and Western education was not considered very important in many divisions. After the regionalization of the public service, political leaders in the region felt that the number of Northerners in the service was minimal in comparison to their counterparts in the South. Due to political considerations, leaders in the region limited the recruitment of Southerners into the Northern regional service and found ways to push up the ranks of northerners in junior and senior positions. The leaders retained the services of expatriates, because Northerners regarded expatriates as transients but feared southern domination of the regional civil service. Measures were put in place to train northerners; in 1949, a scholarship board provided grants to almost all Northerners with qualifications to enter universities. In 1957, administration courses were taught at the Institute of Administration in Zaria. Apart from trying to fill positions in the civil service with Northerners, political leaders in the zone also made it a priority to secure Northern representation in senior positions of the Federal service. Issues Expatriates To prevent loss of career opportunities, the expatriate led Civil Service Organization demanded compensation from the government. In 1958, the colonial office agreed to a compensation plan prior to discussions with the Federal Government. The Nigerian government thus created a lump sum settlement for expatriate officers who wish to leave prior to the granting of independence in 1960 and also promised to fairly treat expatriates who remain after independence. Modifications to the agreement were later made in 1959.

It is an open shrub with many spindly tangled branches. The leaves are oblong and woolly when young and the flowers are whitish pink with purple spots inside and are surrounded by woolly sepals. Description Quoya loxocarpa is an open shrub with many spindly, interlacing branches mostly rising from the base of the plant. The leaves are elliptic to oblong in shape, sometimes almost round, long, wide, usually with the edges wavy or irregularly toothed. They have loose, woolly hairs when young but become glabrous as they mature. The flowers are arranged in the upper leaf axils, usually in a groups of 3 to 7 flowers on a thin stalk long. There is are bracts long, woolly on the outside surface, at the base of the groups and small bracteoles. The five sepals are long and form a tube at the base long, with thin, lance-shaped lobes on the end. The sepal tube is densely covered with purplish, woolly hairs on the outside and glabrous on the inside. The petals are whitish pink with purple spots in the throat, long, forming a tube with a wide opening and five short broad lobes. The lowest lobe is very broad, more or less circular, long and wide. The other four lobes are about half that size and roughly similar to each other. The outside of the petal tube is covered with short, soft hairs and is glabrous inside, apart from a ring of hairs around the ovary and a few long hairs on the largest petal lobe. The four stamens are shorter than the petal tube, the upper pair much shorter than the lower pair. Flowering occurs mainly from July to November and is followed by fruit which is a curved oval shape, long and has the sepals attached. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1860 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Chloanthes loxocarpa. The description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from a specimen collected by Augustus Oldfield near the Murchison River. In 1917, George Druce changed the name to Pityrodia loxocarpa but in 2011, Barry Conn and Murray Henwood changed the name to Quoya loxocarpa and published the change in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (loxocarpa) is derived from the Ancient Greek words ' meaning \\"slanting\\" and ' meaning \\"fruit\\". Distribution and habitat This quoya mostly grows in shrubland in coastal areas in sand over limestone however it is also found in inland areas near Wiluna and Carnegie and near the border with South Australia and the Northern Territory. There are a few records from the Northern Territory. Conservation Quoya loxocarpa is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Teaming with Konosuke Takeshita (2013–2016) Endo in October 2012 In 2013, Endo began teaming with fellow rookie Konosuke Takeshita, teaming with him in a KO-D Tag Team Championship number one contenders match also featuring Kudo and Yasu Urano, losing to the Golden Lovers (Kota Ibushi and Kenny Omega). On January 13, 2014, Endo and Takeshita again faced the Golden Lovers in a number one contenders match, this time going to a time limit draw, making the match for the championships at Sweet Dreams on January 26 a three-way. Endo and Takeshita unsuccessfully challenged champions Yuko Miyamoto and Isami Kodaka, with the Golden Lovers winning the match and the championships. On July 13, Endo won his first championship in DDT, teaming with Takeshita and Antonio Honda as Happy Motel to defeat Shuten Dōji (Kudo, Masa Takanashi and Yukio Sakaguchi) to win the KO-D 6 Man Tag Team Championships. Happy Motel dropped the championships back to Shuten Dōji on July 20 in a triple threat match also featuring Team Dream Futures (Keisuke Ishii, Shigehiro Irie and Soma Takao). Endo competed in the KO-D Openweight Championship Number One Contenders Tournament, defeating partner Takeshita in the semi-finals on August 24, but losing to Keisuke Ishii in the final. On September 28, Endo and Takeshita captured the KO-D 6 Man Tag Team Championships, defeating the Golden Lovers. The duo successfully defended the championships for 6 months, defeating Shuten Doji (Kudo and Masa Takanashi), Team Dream Futures (Keisuke Ishii and Shigehiro Irie), Makoto Oishi and Shiori Asahi and Kudo and Yukio Sakaguchi before dropping the belts to Daisuke Sekimoto and Yuji Okabayashi on February 15. On September 13, Endo and Takeshita unsuccessfully challenged the Golden Storm Riders (Kota Ibushi and Daisuke Sasaki) for the KO-D Tag Team Championships. Endo received his first opportunity at the KO-D Openweight Championship on December 13, unsuccessfully challenging Isami Kodaka. After the KO-D Tag Team Championships were vacated due to Kota Ibushi being sidelined with a cervical disc herniation, a tournament was set up to crown new champions, won by Endo and Takeshita after they defeated Shigehiro Irie and Yuji Okabayashi in the final on December 23. On December 29, Endo and Takeshita competed in a special mixed tag team match, teaming with Stardom's Io Shirai to defeat Shuten Doji (Kota Umeda and Yukio Sakaguchi) and Kyoko Kimura. Endo and Takeshita made their first successful defence of the tag team championships on January 16, defeating Isami Kodaka and Ryota Nakatsu, but lost the championships to Damnation (Shuji Ishikawa and Daisuke Sasaki) on March 23 and unsuccessfully challenged them in a rematch on April 24. Endo participated in the 2016 King Of DDT tournament, making it to the semi-finals before being eliminated by eventual winner Shuji Ishikawa. Damnation (2016–present) Endo (second from left) as part of Damnation On July 17, Endo unsuccessfully challenged longtime friend and tag team partner Takeshita for Takeshita's KO-D Openweight Championship. After the match, Daisuke Sasaki made his way to the ring, carrying a Damnation T-shirt and offering Endo a spot in the group. At the same time, Takeshita offered a handshake as a sign of respect for his longtime friend. Endo pushed Takeshita away, taking the Damnation T-shirt instead, attacking Takeshita, joining Damnation and turning heel for the first time in his career. On August 6, Endo, Sasaki and Mad Paulie defeated Shuten Doji (Kota Umeda, Masahiro Takanashi and Yukio Sakaguchi) in the finals of a tournament to win the KO-D 6 Man Tag Team Championships. On October 9, Endo and Sasaki won the KO-D Tag Team Championships, becoming double champions, however, on December 4, Endo and Sasaki lost the KO-D Tag Team Championships to Takeshita and Mike Bailey and on December 11 lost the KO-D 6 Man Tag Team Championships to Shuten Doji (Takanashi, Sakaguchi and Kudo).

Florida has faced threats to its indigenous sites from looting, a lack of protection, citizen or amateur archaeologists, development, and other factors. Only in recent years has the protection of indigenous sites become a focus in Florida, where a long history of site destruction and looting is now being challenged. Law enforcement agencies mainly the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, have made efforts to protect Native American sites and disrupt the illegal artifact trade. Additionally anthropological and archaeological societies as well as Native American groups have been public forces fighting to protect indigenous sites. Despite the progress and increasing awareness in Native American site protection, recent bills in both the Senate and the House of Representatives have threatened sites throughout the state. These bills have also brought increased attention to the controversial issue of the protection of Native American sites.  Threats from looting/treasure hunting  The archaeological sites of Florida's indigenous peoples have been disturbed and looted since the arrival of Europeans, however, recent changes have increased the scope and destructiveness of the problem. In the late 1970s looting of sites on state owned lands increased dramatically and spread across the state from the Tampa Bay area north towards the St. Marks River. Entering the 1980s, looting was still on the rise and the market value of illegal artifacts was as well. In 1994 the isolated finds program was introduced, which greatly muddied the line between legal collecting and the illegal artifact trade making an already difficult job of site protection for law enforcement nearly impossible. Looters are generally looking for pottery, stone tools, and human remains, which they can then sell on the black market around the world for significant profits. Some looters are not interested in the illegal artifact trade but are just curious about the past and enjoy finding and collecting artifacts. These looters are no less harmless than those in the trade as they still destroy the cultural and historical context of artifacts making the sites nearly useless. Glen Doran, a Florida State University archaeologist says that a Native American pot that would sell in Florida for $300 can sell in places like Tokyo, Berlin, or London for $10,000 to $50,000. Looters use a variety of methods to excavate artifacts ranging from their bare hands to full size bulldozers. In 1978 looters in Charlotte Harbor, Florida drove a bulldozer across state lands, down an Indian ridge, through the mangroves and out to Big Mound Key. Once on the 13.5 acre site, the looters opened up a 15-foot trench through the mound, apparently in search of non-existent Spanish gold. Looting remains a major concern among archaeologists as it is difficult and expensive for the state to reliably protect sites. Looting concerns are the main reason for the strong opposition of archaeologists and anthropological organizations to the proposed bills related to isolated finds or the Citizen Archaeology Permit.  Law enforcement efforts  Efforts to enforce current laws relating to the protection of indigenous sites have been difficult and largely unsuccessful. There are too many archaeological sites in Florida for law enforcement agencies to be able to monitor them and catch looters while they are digging. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), most looters are very woods savvy and they have often grown up hunting and fishing in the same areas where they steal artifacts. FWC ended a two-year investigation in 2014 named Operation Timucua, led by Maj. Curtis Brown. Operation Timucua was an intense undercover operation aimed at disrupting the illegal artifact trade in Florida. FWC agents understand that catching looters in the act is very difficult so they focussed on stopping the trade of artifacts thus destroying the incentives of looters. The operation resulted in the seizure of two million dollars worth of artifacts and 14 arrests. While the operation was successful, public outcry and lenient court systems ultimately resulted in fairly insignificant sentences. In reference to and defense of Operation Timucua, Rob Bendus, the Florida Department of State Spokesman said, \\"This looting incident didn't just take artifacts out of the ground. It took history away from this generation and future generations of Florida\\".  Native American stance on site protection  Florida has lost the Native American peoples whose sites are most threatened in modern times, however, remaining native groups, mainly the Seminole Tribe of Florida have taken a stance on site protection. In the February 2016 issue of the Seminole Tribune, the Citizen Archaeology Permit as proposed by House bill 803 and Senate Bill 1054 was openly opposed. The article quoted Willie Johns, Chief Justice of the Seminole Tribal Court in reference to House Bill 803 saying, “We don’t go out digging in other peoples’ cemeteries. Now, for $100 you get a free pass to dig up my grandparents.” The article focussed on the possibility of losing cultural heritage and the reversal of the progress that has been made in the protection of indigenous sacred sites.  Isolated Finds Program  The Isolated Finds Program, sometimes referred to as the Isolated Finds Policy, was implemented by Florida's Department of Historic Resources in 1994 and ended in June 2005. The Isolated Finds Program was intended to establish a way for private citizens to legally collect archaeological artifacts and report them to the state. In order to be legally collected the artifacts had to be on submerged state lands such as river bottoms and displaced from their original context. Isolated artifacts on submerged lands are often thought to be removed from their context and original place of deposition which would mean that they have lost much of their historical and cultural significance. Unfortunately amateur, citizen archaeologists are not qualified to determine whether or not an artifact is in its original context, which often led to the destruction of archaeological sites under the protection of the Isolated Finds Program. Florida is also unique in that its rivers do not flow like the rivers of other states with isolated finds programs. Rivers in Florida are generally very slow flowing and are composed of fill sediments that hold artifacts very well, making isolated artifacts less likely to occur. The Isolated finds program was discontinued on June 1, 2005 following a recommendation from the Florida Historical Commission. The program was widely considered a failure as issues of non-compliance from citizens basically defeated the program's purpose and instead provided a legal front for the looting of archaeological sites and the illegal artifact trade. Additionally, citizens often reported isolated finds that were later referenced and discovered to be from known archaeological sites, further highlighting the difficulty of determining whether or not a find is isolated. Some do argue that the program had some success, citing the first 8 years of the program in which there were 660 reports from a total of 86 individuals of 4,939 prehistoric and 103 historic artifacts. While these numbers show that some finds were reported there is no way to determine how many finds went unreported or were not actually isolated. Following the discontinuation of the Isolated Finds Programs, groups have lobbied for a bill every year that would bring back the program, at least to some degree, with the Citizen Archaeology Permit bills of 2016 being the most notable.  Citizen Archaeology Permit (CAP)  The Citizen Archaeology Permit or CAP was proposed by the 2016 House Bill 803 and 2016 Senate Bill 1054. The CAP program was basically a reincarnation of Florida's failed Isolated Finds Program of 1994-2005. The bills direct Florida's Department of Historical Resources to implement a program that would allow for the legal recovery of Native American artifacts by private citizens. Citizens with the $100 permit would be allowed to remove artifacts from submerged lands owned by the state (mostly rivers) as long as they were not in their original context. Permit holders would be allowed to use only trowels to recover artifacts and would be required to document the location and the artifact through photographs and other means then submit the information to the state. The idea behind the bills is that citizens would only remove artifacts in rivers that were already dislodged from their original contexts through the process of erosion, thus not destroying any archaeological evidence. Citizens already remove the artifacts illegally so the program would allow for them to register their finds with the state, giving archaeologists access to otherwise private collections. There has been widespread criticism of and opposition to the proposed Citizen Archaeology Permit by archaeological and historical communities in Florida. Theresa Schober, president of the Florida Anthropological Society opposed the program stating that it was not proposed to help casual collectors as it would seem from the wording, but rather it was proposed to help those who are in the currently illegal artifact trade. Schober also points out that the organizations that are lobbying for the bill, while they may seem similar to chapters of the Florida Anthropological Society (FAS), do not meet the ethical requirements of the FAS. Schober argues that the CAP program will reverse the legislative progress that has been made in protecting Florida's cultural heritage and will exploit non-renewable historical and archaeological resources. In January 2016, J.W. Joseph the president of the Society for Historical Archaeology also wrote a letter in opposition to House Bill 803. The Society for Historical Archaeology letter voiced similar concerns to those of other groups, however, J.W. Joseph also brought up that the CAP program would likely endanger historical and cultural sites outside of submerged state lands. Citizens with a CAP would be inclined to excavate in stream banks and other areas near waterways according to the letter. J.W. Joseph also appeals to the state by bringing up that CAP holders would create navigational hazards in waterways and that the state would incur great costs to run the program with little return from the sale of permits. In March 2016, the Florida Association of Museums (FAM) released a statement in opposition to House Bill 803. Much of the statement focussed on concerns that the CAP program would endanger Florida's cultural heritage and historic record. The statement stressed that this program will cause the loss of irreplaceable archaeological sites that need to be studied by experts rather than destroyed by hobbyists. Additionally, the artifacts recovered by private citizens will end up in private collections where the cultural heritage cannot be shared, rather than being turned over to places like the Seminole Tribe of Florida’s Tribal Historic Research Office (THPO). The FAM statement also brings up a point that many other organizations opposed to the bill have not vocalized, which is the section of the bill that requires the Division of Historical Resources to provide Citizen Archaeology Permit holders with a map of archaeological sites that cannot be excavated. The disclosure of this information directly contradicts current law that exempts archaeological sites from public records in order to preserve their cultural and historical value from looting and other destructive behaviors.  Problems of site protection in Florida  Florida has a unique history, culture, and climate that makes the protection of Native American sites especially difficult. Despite Florida's long history of indigenous and European occupation, the first professional archaeology in south Florida was not conducted until 1869 by Jeffries Wyman of Harvard’s Peabody Museum. Additionally, there was no comprehensive law that protected cultural and natural resources until the Antiquities Act of 1906. Prior to 1906, Florida residents had free rein to loot and destroy cultural and historical sites including shell mounds and ancient burials. There have also been the longstanding issues of the lack of funding and enforcement related to indigenous site protection. Many local governments do not have the resources to enforce existing laws and local governments are also inconsistent in their enforcement of the laws. Florida has a long and continuing history of rapid development, which is often in conflict with the protection and preservation of archaeological sites. In the past 60 years, Florida's population has risen from 4.5 million to 18.8 million, which increases the strain on cultural and historic resources. Advances in technology such as Scuba equipment that became widely available in 1968 have also increased the strain on submerged archaeological sites and the difficulty of protecting them. One major issue facing the those who seek to preserve sites in modern times, is the lack of public interest in the subject. Many residents do not understand the cultural and historic significance of local indigenous sites because there is little visible surface evidence of occupation.  Threats from invasive species  The invasive feral hog was introduced to Florida first in 1539 by the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Aside from harboring diseases, killing native plant and animal species, and destroying crops, feral hogs are also a significant threat to indigenous sites in Florida. Feral hogs often root as deep as 20 centimeters in the soft Florida soil with some examples of rooting up to 45 centimeters in Florida. A study on feral hog rooting that involved 293 archaeological sites in Florida found that 90% of the sites had artifacts within the first 20 centimeters of the soil and 85% of sites had artifacts within the first 10 centimeters of the soil, making these sites especially vulnerable to feral hog disturbance. The study gave a conservative estimate that 42% of the sites experienced feral hog disturbance during the time period of study. The study also found that after 18 months the damage from feral hogs was impossible to detect, which would lead archaeologists to believe that the sites had not been disturbed.  Laws related to indigenous site protection  The following is a list of legislation and codes with brief descriptions related to the protection of Native American sites in Florida.  Seminole Tribe of Florida's Cultural Resource Ordinance, 2013  Seminole Tribe of Florida's Cultural Resource Ordinance or CRO was adopted by the tribal council in 2013 and approved by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in 2016. This ordinance allows the tribe to take control of all cultural resources within reservation lands.  The Antiquities Act of 1906  The Antiquities Act of 1906 was the first federal law that provided protection for cultural and historic resources.  The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA)  The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) was intended to establish a program that would further the preservation of additional historic properties throughout the United States.  Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act  Under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, federal agencies are required to consider the consequences of their activities on historic properties and allow the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation to consult on the issue.  Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) of 1979  The Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 was intended to protect archaeological and cultural resources on public and Indian lands for future generations. Additionally the ARPA was to improve relations between the government, professional archaeologists, and private citizens.  Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1990  The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) gives the rights to Native American descendants of the treatment of Native American remains and funerary goods.  Chapter 872.05-- Unmarked Human Burials (Florida Statutes, Title XLVI, Offenses Concerning Dead Bodies and Graves)  Chapter 872.05 ensures that all human burials be treated with proper respect and dignity regardless of the background of the individual and the location of the site be it on state, submerged, or private lands.

The subjects were well-known courtesans, geisha, and others associated with the Yoshiwara pleasure districts of Edo (modern Tokyo). Due to legal restrictions, the names of the women appear do not appear in the prints. To get around this, hanji-e picture-puzzles appear in the rebus in the top corner of each print; solving them reveals the names. In 1796, the restrictions were tightened, and even the hanji-e were disallowed. Thereafter, the prints were republished as Fūryū Rokkasen (, \\"Elegant Six Immortal Poets\\"), with the hanji-e replaced with pictures of the Rokkasen \\"Six Immortal Poets\\" of the 9th century. Background Ukiyo-e art flourished in Japan during the Edo period from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects courtesans, kabuki actors, and others associated with the \\"floating world\\" lifestyle of the pleasure districts. Alongside paintings, mass-produced woodblock prints were a major form of the genre. In the mid-18th century full-colour ' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour. A prominent genre was ' (\\"pictures of beauties\\"), which depicted most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments of the pleasure districts. Kitagawa Utamaro (–1806) made his name in the 1790s with his bijin ōkubi-e (\\"large-headed pictures of beautiful women\\") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors. Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background. Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm. Publication The six prints are multicolour nishiki-e prints in ōban size (about ). They were published in by . Retitled versions of the prints appeared in a later series titled Fūryū Rokkasen (, \\"Elegant Six Immortal Poets\\"). Description and analysis The series depicts six well-known beauties associated with the Yoshiwara pleasure districts—courtesans, geisha, and the like. A rebus appears in the corner of each print bearing the title Kōmei Bijin Rokkasen (, \\"Renowned Beauties from the Six Best Houses\\") and a hanji-e picture-puzzle. This was done in response to a shogunal edict of 1793 (one of the Kansei Reforms) that banned the inscription of names on ukiyo-e prints. To get around this restriction—and perhaps to add the pleasure of a puzzle for viewers to solve—Utamaro resorted to hanji-e to symbolize the name of the model. The restrictions expanded to include even these measures in 1796. In Fūryū Rokkasen the hanji-e is replaced with the seated figure of one of the rokkasen \\"six poetry immortals\\" of the mid-9th century. Rokkasen is spelled with different kanji characters in the two series; the earlier is a parody of the latter, which is derived from the original kanji characters for the rokkasen poets. Both series were published by Ōmiya Kenkura and are signed Utamaro hitsu (). Estimated publication dates range from 1794 to 1798. Other minor differences in printed copies exist—the print of O-Kita, for example, has editions with and without the seal saishutsu (, \\"re-appearance\\") on it, and there are editions of both Hinodeya goke and O-Hisa with eyebrows and with the eyebrows shaved off. Naniwaya O-Kita Utamaro (1795–96) Kōmei bijin rokkasen - Naniwaya O-Kita.jpgKōmei Bijin Rokkasen version Utamaro (1790s) Fūryū Rokkasen - Naniwaya O-Kita.jpgFūryū Rokkasen version, matching O-Kita with the poet Ariwara no Narihira Utamaro depicts the popular teahouse girl O-Kita of the Naniwaya () when she was about 18. The Naniwaya was a teahouse near Asakusa Shrine. She stands in a modest posture offering a teacup on a saucer. She wears an ornate hairpin with a paulownia blossom in it and her clothing is patterned with stylized ivy, both symbols associated with O-Kita. O-Kita's name is deciphered from the hanji-e as follows: from top to bottom, two bunches of rapeseed ( na ni-wa; wa is a Japanese counter word for bundles), an arrow (, ya), the open sea offshore (, and a rice paddy field ( ta). The Fūryū Rokkasen version matches O-Kita with Ariwara no Narihira. There are different interpretations for why some editions bear the seal saishutsu (, \\"re-appearance\\"), such as that O-Kita had withdrawn from public and made a re- appearance. Tatsumi Rokō Utamaro (1795–96) Kōmei bijin rokkasen - Tatsumi Rokō.jpgKōmei Bijin Rokkasen version Utamaro (1790s) Fūryū Rokkasen - Toba Sōjō.jpgFūryū Rokkasen version, matching Rokō with the poet Toba Sōjō Utamaro portrays the geisha Rokō of the Tatsumi district ( Tatsumi Rokō). She poses with her right hand placed behind her right ear and the cord to an incense pouch is visible around her neck. Rokō was a stage name of , a kabuki actor who specialized in onnagata roles playing young women; he was so popular that some women had Rokō appended to their names. Tatsumi means \\"southeast\\" and refers to the Fukagawa area southeast of Edo Castle; Fukagawa was known for its yūkaku pleasure district. From this it is deduced that \\"Tatsumi Rokō\\" refers to a popular beauty from Fukagawa, but it is not clear who she was. Rokō's name is deciphered from the hanji-e as follows: from top to bottom, a dragon ( tatsu), a snake (, mi on the Chinese zodiac), a pair of rowing sculls ( ro), and some burning incense ( kō). In the Fūryū Rokkasen version she is matched with the poet Sōjō Henjō. Takashimaya O-Hisa Utamaro (1795–96) Kōmei bijin rokkasen - Takashimaya O-Hisa.jpgKōmei Bijin Rokkasen version with eyebrows Utamaro (c. 1795–96) Kōmei bijin rokkasen - Takashimaya O-Hisa (TNM, cropped).jpgKōmei Bijin Rokkasen version without eybrows Utamaro depicts Takashimaya O-Hisa (), the eldest daughter of Takashima Chōbei, the owner of a roadside teahouse at his home called Senbeiya in which Hisa worked attracting customers. At the time of publication O-Hisa was about 19. Her kimono bears her three-leafed daimyo oak crest, and three daimyo oak leaves adorns her hairpin. O-Hisa's name is deciphered from the hanji-e as follows: a perching falcon ( taka), an island ( shima), a kagaribi flare fire ( hi, \\"fire\\"), and an egret ( shirasagi, from which sa comes from sagi, \\"heron\\"). The Fūryū Rokkasen version matches O-Hisa with Ōtomo no Kuronushi. Ōgiya Hanaōgi Kōmei Bijin Rokkasen version Utamaro depicts the courtesan Hanaōgi of the Ōgiya () as she composes a letter, writing brush held to her cheek as she stares at the paper deep in thought. The Ōgiya was a large, long- established shop in Yoshiwara, and Hanaōgi built her reputation in the 1780s for her beauty and her skills in singing, playing the koto, the tea ceremony, the Chinese classics, and incense. Hanaōgi's name is deciphered from the hanji-e as follows: from top to bottom, a hand fan ( ōgi), an arrow (, ya), flowers ( hana), and another hand fan ( ōgi). The Fūryū Rokkasen version matches Hanaōgi with Ono no Komachi. Hinodeya goke Utamaro (1795–96) Kōmei bijin rokkasen - Asahiya goke.jpgKōmei Bijin Rokkasen version with eyebrows Utamaro (c. 1795–96) Kōmei bijin rokkasen - Asahiya goke (TNM, cropped).jpgKōmei Bijin Rokkasen version without eyebrows The subject of this print is not clear. She may be the Hinodeya goke (, \\"The Hinodeya widow\\"), the Asahiya goke (, \\"The Asahiya widow\\"), or the Karasumori goke ( \\"Karasumori widow\\"). She was one of the most popular beauties in Edo at the time of publication. Utamaro depicts the widow drying her right ear with a cloth after having had a bath. At the time, the image of a woman with shaven eyebrows after a bath was considered particularly erotic. Variations of the eprint exist: he widow has eyebrows in the copy at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, but in the copy at the Tokyo National Museum her eyebrows are missing—shaving off the eyebrows was a sign of a married woman during the Edo period. Suggested explanations include that reprints appeared when the widow shaved or regrew her eyebrows, but such an explanation is complicated by the fact that the print of the geisha Takashimaya O-Hisa also has variants with and without eyebrows. Utamaro symbolizes the name of the model with image in the rebus in the top left. The rising sun may refer either to the Hinodeya or to the Asahiya (both asahi and hinode meaning \\"rising sun\\"), or the crows flying out of the forst may refer to Karasumori Shrine ( Karasumori, \\"crow forest\\"). The Go board and lock of hair (ke) combine to make go-ke, homophonous with goke for \\"widow\\". The Fūryū Rokkasen version matches the widow with the poet Fun'ya no Yasuhide. Tomimoto Toyohina Utamaro (1795–96) Kōmei bijin rokkasen - Tomimoto Toyohina.jpgKōmei Bijin Rokkasen version Utamaro (1790s) Fūryū Rokkasen - Kisen Hōshi.jpgFūryū Rokkasen version, matching Toyohina with the poet Kisen Hōshi Tomimoto Toyohina () was a geisha who worked at the Tamamuraya in Yoshiwara. She was dubbed \\"Tomimoto\\" having made her name playing Tomimoto-bushi music on the shamisen. Toyohina's name is deciphered from the hanji-e as follows: a lottery box in the top right marked tomi ( \\"wealth\\" or \\"fortune\\"), some algae (, mo), a grinding stone ( to), a door ( to), a paper lantern signifying \\"night\\" ( yo), and a paper hina doll ( hina). The Fūryū Rokkasen version matches Toyohina with Kisen Hōshi.

Little is known of his early life. He was born in London, the son of John Hall and his wife, Elizabeth.Robert L. Patten, ‘Hall, William (1800–1847)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2016 accessed 27 Jan 2017 With Edward Chapman (1804-1880) he founded a bookselling and publishing business at 186 Strand, London in 1830, having bought out a small journal called Chat Of The Week. According to Robert L. Patten by 1835 they were publishing illustrated fiction and magazines issued weekly or monthly. Chapman is thought to have had the literary skills to be able to spot a saleable book while Hall had the business acumen to sell it. John Sutherland, The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction, Routledge (2013) - Google Books In 1835 Chapman and Hall published Squib Annual of Poetry, Politics, and Personalities by the illustrator Robert Seymour. In 1836 Seymour proposed to William Hall that Chapman & Hall should publish a series of sporting illustrations by Seymour with short written sketches linking them together in some way. Further he developed the idea of a 'Nimrod Club' of sporting people having adventures as the framework for the sketches and illustrations. Chapman agreed that the work should be issued in monthly parts, with descriptive text by Charles Dickens. However, Dickens, then only 22, was not the first choice as writer. Charled Whitehead, the senior editor in the publishing house, did not have time to complete the work so recommended Dickens on the basis of his recently published and successful Sketches by Boz, also in a monthly periodical format. Eventually, this became The Pickwick Papers, and concerned the adventures of Samuel Pickwick and his friends. Following the suicide of Robert Seymour, Dickens suggested to William Hall that Hablot Knight Browne should be the new illustrator. In May of 1837 The Pickwick Papers sold over 20,000 copies and Hall sent Dickens a cheque for £500 as a bonus above the agreed payment. By the end of its monthly publications Pickwick was selling over 40,000 copies a month and Dickens received a further £2,000 bonus with Chapman & Hall making about £14,000 from the publication.William Hall on Sparatcus Educational Charles Dickens attended Hall's wedding in 1840, an event he fictionalized for Sketches of Young Couples which Chapman and Hall published in 1840. There Mr Chirrup (Hall) is described as having the smartness and ‘the brisk, quick manner of a small bird’.Arthur Waugh, A Hundred Years of Publishing: Being the Story of Chapman & Hall, Ltd., Chapman & Hall, Ltd, London (1930) pg 6 After Dickens spent many \\"pleasant, playful evenings\\" at their house in Norwood. Dickens also arranged for his friends such as Thomas Carlyle to be published by Chapman and Hall and for John Forster to become the literary advisor to the company. William Hall died suddenly at Chapman & Hall's office at 186 Strand, London in March 1847 aged 46. Charles Dickens was present at his burial at Highgate Cemetery. On Hall's death Edward Chapman's cousin Frederic Chapman began his progress through the ranks of the company, eventually becoming a partner in 1858 and sole proprietor on Edward Chapman's retirement from Chapman & Hall in 1866.

The tower is named after local businessman Arthur Hopwood who paid for it to be constructed in 1953. The Maori name for the clock tower 'Kerei Te Panau' comes from the name of a local Rangitane chieftain. The modern tower has two luminous features, a 'lantern cross' at its top and light-up glass panes at the base. History Originally housed in the city's post office on Main Street, the clock (which is named Kerei Te Panau after a local Rangitāne chieftain) was removed following the 1942 Wairarapa earthquake for safety reasons and placed into storage. In 1953 local business man Arthur Hopwood, whose family owned a hardware store, paid £10,000 for the council to build a new tower to house the clock. The tower was completed some time in 1957. A band rotunda was demolished to make way for the new tower. The tower has been renovated many times since its construction. During the early 1960s, a stone cross was added atop the tower. The sound shell at the tower's base was removed 1990. During the refurbishment of The Square in the mid 2000s the building was checked against modern building regulations and was deemed that significant strengthening was needed. The tower was demolished and renewed with a stronger structure that matched the old design. The lantern section was added during this process also. This lantern features a cross inside, a symbol which divided the community as to whether it was appropriate. This process was completed in March 2007 and cost $1.7 million.

Aka: Mademoiselle, Mme., M'lle, and Madame Alice Zeno Early years Lucy Alice Huonker (Americanized Hunger) was born 25 June 1869 in Blairsville, Pennsylvania. Lucy was the only child born to Martian A Huonker of Germany and Lucy Curry of Pennsylvania. Her parents did not marry and Lucy was raised by her Grandmother Nancy Curry. Lucy made her first appearance in the News as a young girl. When she was just 15 Lucy and her friend Annie Miller hopped on a train, the Philadelphia Express, heading east along the tracks behind her grandma's house. The two runaways were reported and a telegraph was sent ahead to the police in Johnstown, Pennsylvania where the two were taken into custody. Annie's father retrieved the two girls the following day. Copy of Photograph of Paul L Hague (Prof. Zeno) and Lucy Alice Huonker (Madame Zeno) from Jacktown fair circa 1893. Provided by the Mrs Blanch T Burns family collection. Career Introduction into balloon ascension While visiting Cincinnati, Ohio in 1890 she attended a theater matinee about balloon ascension. After the show she approached the presenter, Professor Zeno, whose real name was Paul Hague, and insisted she could do that. After some discussion Professor Zeno offered her a job. The following day Professor Zeno gave his new understudy a pair of tights and showed her what to do. She made her first ascension at the Coney Island Amusement park near Cincinnati whose season was from June 12 to August 31. Lucy was 21 at the time of her first flight. Her second ascension was just across the Ohio River at Silver Grove, Kentucky owned by Harry Davis of Pittsburgh. How it's done The whole contraption. Lucy \\"Madame Zeno\\" would hang or sit on a trapeze that was attached to a parachute whose top was in turn attached to a hot air balloon. The balloon would be inflated from the hot air generated by a bonfire. When the balloon was full the ground crew would release the restraints and the entire contraption would head skyward. The balloons typical maximum altitude was between 3000 and 4000 feet. Once it reached this altitude and the noise of the world below had disappeared Madame Zeno would pull a rope that cut the parachute free from the balloon. The trapeze would drop a few hundred feet and the red, white, and blue parachute overhead would blossom bring her safely back to earth. While floating back to Earth Madame Zeno would wave to the crowd and perform various moves on the trapeze. Madame Zeno used no safety belts or lines to prevent injury should she fall from a height but relied solely on her strength and balance to stay firmly on the trapeze. She recalled making $500 on that first day, $400 for the ascension and another $100 for taking up an advertising banner and selling photos of her and the crew. Headlining After a season with Professor Zeno she went on her own, maintaining the name Madame Zeno. She spent the next 18 years performing at Fairs and Amusement parks during Fourth of July and other celebrations across the nation during the summer. During the winter she worked as an actress in stage melodramas. =Some performances= * 1890 Between Jun 12 - Aug 31: First ascension at Coney Island, Ohio resort. * 1890 Between Jun 12 - Aug 31: Second ascension across the Ohio River at Silver Grove Park, Kentucky. * 1891 late Aug - Sept: Wenona Beach Resort, Michigan.

President Theodore Roosevelt was on his way to his summer cottage at Oyster Bay, New York and stopped to deliver the Independence Day oration at Schenley Park. The President's train was composed of three cars in the first section of the Atlantic Express, East including his special car called the Olympia. Roosevelt was accompanied by Attorney General Knox, Secretary Cortelyou, the President's physician Dr. John F Urie, James Creelman of the New York “Journal”, executive stenographer Mr. Latta, and six secret service men. Billed at the time as the “Greatest Fourth of July that Pittsburgh has ever know” with the parade seen by an estimated 600,000 people. Just before the band played “Hail to the Chief” Madame Zeno's balloon soared towards the sky until she seemed just a speck dangling below the balloon. The crowd grew silent and she cut loose from the balloon. Within a few second the parachute blossomed and a ripple of applause welcomed her as she floated toward the earth just in time for the band to begin playing for the President. After the show President Teddy Roosevelt pinned a medal on her. The President gave his address surrounded by more than 100,000 men, women, and children at the foot of Flagstaff Hill. By midnight more than 750,000 people had visited Schenley Park with no serious accidents to mar the festivities. Close call Filling the balloon. The occasional alighting in a tree was the most common hazard for the parachuting balloonist but on one occasion she experienced an explosion. The bonfire used to fill the balloon with hot air was made using 5 gallons of kerosene and eight or ten oak barrels. At Aliequippa Park on 17 June 1903 the bonfire used in the balloon ascension prematurely exploded resulting in the injury of Madame Zeno. She was severely burned about the limbs and body. The explosion was caused by the fact that the oil man sent her gasoline instead of carbon oil and this exploded.Going up. Final performance and retirement 20 August 1909, Rock Point Park in Ellwood, Pennsylvania: With a crowd of about 8,000 Madam Zeno began her final ascent. Her helper, 17 year old Michael Frances Conroy, was suffering a compound fracture of the arm due to a fall of 70 feet the prior week in Freeport, Long Island. It took 100 or more men to hold the balloon down as local Davy Ball manned the fire to fill the envelope before Madame Zeno ordered the balloon to be released. Upon reaching about 1000 feet she hung by her knees and waved to the crowd below. Once she reached 4,000 feet the wind carried her across the Connoquenessing Creek and almost two miles from the park before Madame Zeno cut loose. She landed in a wet ravine and was up to her waist in water and scratched by the thick briers. Farmer Robert Ramsey assisted her in getting out of the marsh. She told the reporter that was the most dangerous ascent she had ever made due to the deep ravines and craggy hillsides of the surroundings. She did wear a life-preserver on her waist in case of landing in the water, as her friend and teacher had drowned after landing in water. At the age of 30 and weight of 152 pounds she felt it was time to retire. She returned to Pittsburgh and her helper Frances Conroy returned to Newark, New Jersey. After the death of her second husband she moved to California trying her hand at acting in Hollywood but found she did not like it. She settled in Long Beach, California and worked as a hotel manager. On her 90th birthday 25 June 1959 Mrs Alice Zeno Walter took her first airplane ride courtesy of a former neighbor Robert Dilday, his son Burr, and Aircraft Associates head of the flying school Spud Martin. Chief pilot Chuck Berns, took Madame Zeno up in a twin engine Piper Apache for a 30-minute aerial tour of the Long Beach waterfront, the Marina and Disneyland. When they returned to the flight line Zeno was presented a bouquet of roses and a birthday cake. She was asked if she would like to learn to fly and she responded she was too old but wondered if they would let her do a parachute jump out of an airplane. Family Madame Zeno married twice, first to fellow balloon aeronaut John Hunter Whorter, stage name Professor Trainer, 4 August 1891 in Essex, Canada. Her second marriage 15 July 1903 was to entertainer Peter “Pete” Frank Walter, stage name Pete F Baker, in Ontario, Canada. Pete was a member of ”Baker and Farron” and famous for his black face acts including Aunt Jemima. She had no children and after the death of her second husband sometime after 1915 she moved to California in 1918 and eventually settled in Long Beach where she remained until her death in 1964. Death Alice Zeno Walter died 22 May 1964 after two days in Long Beach General Hospital with Bronchopneumonia. She was 94 years old. Her body was donated to the USC School of Medicine 26 May 1964.

He was born in the Highland town of Inverness during the late seventeenth century. In 1687 McBane ran away from home, enlisting in the British army under the Duke of Marlborough. As a career soldier, he served throughout much of Europe, fighting in The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), and taking part in fifteen skirmishes and sixteen battles, including Blenheim (1704) and Malplaquet (1709). McBane also worked as a fencing master, and claimed to have participated in nearly one hundred duels. He fought as a gladiator at the Bear Gardens in Hockley-in-the-Hole and Marybone Fields, London, where he reportedly fought thirty-seven prizes. Among his opponents were some of the most celebrated swordsmen and fencing masters of the century, such as James Miller, Timothy Buck, and James Figg. McBane is best known for his book, The Expert Sword-Man's Companion (1728). The book includes McBane's memoirs as well as his extensive treatise on the art of fencing, and is a major source for the study of Scottish swordsmanship. McBane's life and writings are featured in a number of classic works on fencing, including Egerton Castle's Schools and Masters of Fence (1892) and Captain Alfred Hutton's The Sword and the Centuries (1901). Hutton describes McBane as a \\"first class swordsman,\\" and, > Unlike the majority of his class, he was something of a scholar, for he left > behind him a work, “The Expert Swordman’s Companion,” which contains a > number of wise lessons for both the small and back sword; but perhaps the > most interesting part of it is the account he gives of his life when serving > in Flanders under the great Duke of Marlborough. There is a rough quaintness > in the style of his narrative that adds flavour to the curious anecdotes of > fights in which he was engaged. The British historian J. D. Aylward called McBane's memoir \\"possibly, the most ingenuous autobiography in the English language.\\"  References  Swordsmen ","title":"Donald McBane"},{"id":"52935723","text":"Robert Smigel (2008) \\"Ex Mach Tina\\" is the 8th episode of the seventh season of the American animated comedy series Bob's Burgers and the 115th episode overall. It was written by Greg Thompson and directed by Brian Loschiavo. Its guest stars are David Herman as Mr. Frond and as Mr. Branca, Robert Smigel as the school's night security guard, Samantha Bee as school nurse Liz, Jenny Slate as Tammy Larsen and Bobby Tisdale as Zeke. It originally aired in the US on FOX Network at January 8, 2017. In this episode Tina hurts her ankle and uses a telecommunication robot for school, so she can stay at home. Jimmy Jr. develops a relationship to the robot version of Tina. Meanwhile Bob buys a banjo and waits for a good moment to play it.  Plot  Tina wears the new high-heeled shoes to school she bought for the 8th grade bonfire on the beach but she falls and hurts her ankle. Guidance counselor Mr. Frond tells her that a company is looking to test a remote-presence robot, so she can use it to attend classes while recovering at home. While Tina is driving the robot to one of her classes, the school custodian Mr. Branca mistakes the robot for a TV set and puts it in the AV closet. Jimmy Jr. later goes into the closet to be alone and starts talking with robot-Tina. Tina and Jimmy Jr. repeatedly visit the closet to converse during Tina's recovery and he shares his intimate feelings and musical poems, which he stubbornly calls \\"musoems\\". When Jimmy Jr. brings Tina her homework, it becomes clear he is more comfortable speaking to Tina via the robot than in person. At night, while Tina sleeps, her siblings Gene and Louise borrow the laptop that controls the robot and have some fun by wreaking havoc at their school. They also fool the school's nighttime security guard into thinking that the robot is his supervisor when he catches them. Meanwhile, Bob buys a banjo at a thrift store. He tries playing it but he is met with derision. So he waits for a \\"banjo moment,\\" a situation which calls for banjo playing. Jimmy Jr. invites robot-Tina to the beach bonfire. Gene and Louise get the school security guard to help the robot leave the school. On the beach Jimmy Jr. kisses the camera of the Tina robot and reads his poems to his classmates. Tina decides to go there in person and her family joins her. Bob realizes his banjo moment has arrived and plays along while Jimmy Jr. reads the rest of his poems. Jimmy Jr. and Tina kiss in person while Zeke tries to dump the robot into the ocean.  Reception  Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B\\" and wrote that Jimmy Jr.'s \\"interest may not necessarily be in Tina herself, but rather a more selfish—albeit understandable—impulse to have someone listen to all the confused thoughts and feelings that all the musoems in the world can’t fully process. But then, Tina has always mostly wanted Jimmy Jr. for his butt and his dance moves, with personality running a distant second.\\" He also noted that the \\"Jimmy Jr. of this episode doesn’t just act differently because the story needs him to in order to be maximally funny. Tonight’s version of Jimmy Jr. is a progression from what we’ve seen previously, but it’s possible to connect the dots with how he’s been used before. That attentiveness to his long-term character makes it still better when he drops new little details about his difficult home life\\".

As of May 2020, the Trump administration has rolled back 64 environmental rules and regulations, and an additional 34 rollbacks are in progress. Some environmentalists are concerned that a successful reelection of Trump in 2020 will result in severe and irreversible changes in the climate. The Trump administration supports energy development on federal land, including gas and oil drilling in national parks. Soon after taking office, Trump began to implement his \\"America First Energy Plan\\" and signed executive orders to approve two controversial oil pipelines. In 2018, the Department of the Interior announced plans to allow drilling in nearly all U.S. waters, the largest expansion of offshore oil and gas leasing ever proposed. In 2019, the Administration completed plans for opening the entire coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. Trump and his cabinet appointees do not believe the opinions of most scientists that climate change will have catastrophic impacts nor that carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to climate change. Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord, leaving the U.S. the only nation that is not part of the agreement. He avoided environmental discussions at both the 44th G7 summit held in Canada and the 45th G7 summit held in France by departing early from these conferences. In September 2019, the Trump administration replaced the Obama- era Clean Power Plan with the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which does not cap emissions. In April 2020, he issued his new vehicle emissions standards, which are projected to result in an additional billion tons of carbon dioxide, increasing annual U.S. emissions by about one-fifth. The administration rewrote the EPA's pollution-control policies—including on chemicals known to be serious health risks—particularly benefiting the chemicals industry, and repealed the Clean Water Rule in September 2019. A 2018 analysis reported that the Trump administration's rollbacks and proposed reversals of environmental rules would likely \\"cost the lives of over 80,000 US residents per decade and lead to respiratory problems for many more than 1 million people.\\" Background At a Republican primary debate in Detroit on March 3, 2016, Trump said: “Department of Environmental Protection: We are going to get rid of it in almost every form. We’re going to have little tidbits left. But we’re going to take a tremendous amount out.” During the campaign, Trump expressed the view that global warming and cooling is a natural process. He often described global warming as a \\"hoax\\"; and sometimes attributed the \\"hoax\\" to the Chinese government as a plot to sabotage American manufacturing, but later claimed that had been a joke. As a candidate Trump said he would rescind Obama's Climate Action Plan, cancel U.S. participation in the Paris Climate Agreement, and stop all U.S. payments towards United Nations global warming programs. Many of his first cabinet picks were people with a history of opposition to the agency they were named to head. Within days after taking office, he invited American manufacturers to suggest which regulations should be eliminated; industry leaders submitted 168 comments, of which nearly half targeted Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules. Within his first couple months in office, he required a federal review of the Clean Water Rule and the Clean Power Plan. He did not attend the climate discussions held during both the 2018 and 2019 G7 meetings, the only world leader not in attendance. Appointments Trump's cabinet nominees reflect his desire to scale back federal environmental regulation and to promote domestic production of coal, oil, and natural gas. In some cases his appointees had a history of conflict with the agencies they now lead. Although the scientific conclusion is that “it is extremely likely (95 to 100 percent probable) that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,” Trump's department head appointees do not agree that global warming has been man-made. President Trump's appointments to key agencies dealing in energy and environmental policy reflect his commitment to deregulation, particularly of the fossil fuel industry. Three of the four chair-level members of Trump's transition team commissioned to draw up a list of proposals to guide his Native American policies had links to the oil industry. In July 2018, amid numerous ethics investigations, Trump's first appointment for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt, resigned and was replaced by Andrew Wheeler. First EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt As the attorney general of Oklahoma, Trump's choice of EPA administrator Scott Pruitt challenged EPA regulations in court more than a dozen times. With some cases still pending, Pruitt declined to say if he would recuse himself with regard to those suits. Pruitt hired former Oklahoma banker Albert Kelly to head the Superfund program, which is responsible for cleaning up the nation's most contaminated land. Kelly completely lacked any experience with environmental issues, and had just received a lifetime ban from working in banking, his career until then, due to \\"unfitness to serve\\". Pruitt said he planned to prioritize state and local control over federal land use and ease regulations on the environmental impacts of industries. A March 2017 executive order allowed Pruitt to start a review process of the Obama administration's regulations of the coal industry, reflecting Trump's repeated promises to support the coal industry and \\"bring back jobs\\" in coal mining. Such changes are likely to affect America's ability to meet the climate emission goals of the Paris Agreement. Pruitt has said he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming. While admitting that the climate is warming, Pruitt believes that warming is not necessarily harmful and could be beneficial. \\"Do we really know what the ideal surface temperature should be in the year 2100, in the year 2018? That’s fairly arrogant for us to think that we know exactly what it should be in 2100.” Climate experts, including Michael Mann and Chris Field who oversaw a United Nations and World Meteorological Organization scientific report on climate change, disagree with Pruitt's position. According to Field, \\"thousands\\" of studies document that a warming planet causes a host of problems, not just from high temperatures but also from heat waves, higher seas, heavier downpours, and more frequent destructive hurricanes and wildfires.\\" In April 2018, Pruitt drew criticism for what some consider to be the excessive security expenditures which he had requested. Trump defended Pruitt in a tweet stating, \\"Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars.\\" However, according to PolitiFact no new figures on air quality have been released since 2016. To state the nation's waters as being at record clean levels is also inaccurate since while a report was issued in 2017, the information was gathered in 2012 or earlier. Commenting on Pruitt's claim that his excessive security expenses are related to his need for security, The New York Times commented that the high expenses appear to be \\"driven more by a desire to avoid tough questions from the public than by concerns about security.\\" In April 2018, thirty-nine members of the Senate and more than 130 members of the House of Representatives called for Pruitt's resignation. On July 5, 2018, President Trump tweeted, \\"I have accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this.\\" At the time of his resignation Pruitt was facing numerous ethics investigations. Second EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler In 2017 Trump nominated Andrew Wheeler to be the deputy administrator of the EPA. Wheeler has worked as a coal industry lobbyist, specializing in energy and environmental policy. He is a critic of nationwide limits on greenhouse gas emissions and has supported the continued use of fossil fuels. The Senate rejected him in 2017 and Trump resubmitted his name in January 2018. In March 2018, Wheeler commented to CNN that the EPA is \\"brainwashing our kids.\\" His nomination was confirmed on April 12, 2018, by a mostly party line vote of 53–45, that included three Democratic senators.Senate confirms a former coal lobbyist as Scott Pruitt’s second-in- command at EPA, Washington Post, Steven Mufson, Brady Dennis & Dino Grandoni, April 12, 2018. Retrieved April 13, 2018. Following Pruitt's resignation, Wheeler was appointed to head the EPA on July 5, 2018. Following his appointment Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune commented, \\"He fought against safeguards to limit mercury poisoning. He fought against protections to limit the amount of ozone in our skies. He fought against air pollution from neighboring states. He’s a climate denier. So, sadly, he fits in well with EPA leadership.\\" Department of Energy The United States Department of Energy is tasked with developing technology for better and more efficient energy sources as well as energy education. Trump chose Rick Perry to head the department, who had called for eliminating it when he was running for the Republican nomination for president in 2012. His confirmation as head of the Department of Energy was a source of contention among Democrats due to his previous denial of man-made climate change and his close ties to the Texas oil and gas industry. During his confirmation hearing, Perry said he regretted his promise to abolish the Department of Energy. In March 2017, Perry met with Murray Energy CEO Robert Murray and coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler who would later replace Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA. Murray submitted a confidential \\"action plan\\" at the meeting. In an interview with the Associated Press (AP) Simon Edelman, who was at the time a government photographer who was taking photos of the meeting, the actions Murray wanted the Trump administration to take \\"included replacing members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accords and revoking the Clean Power Plan.\\" He said that he was fired shortly after he released the photographs of the meeting. A copy of the plan was obtained by The New York Times and the AP in January 2018. They reported that \\"it mirrors policy later pushed by the Trump administration.\\" Department of the Interior Ryan Zinke was appointed Secretary of the Interior in 2017. Following his appointment, Zinke said that he had made “probably the greatest reorganization in the history of the Department of the Interior.\\" Some scientists charged that some of the staff changes were politically motivated. Zinke supported Trump's plan to reduce the DOI budget by $1.6 billion in 2018, which would have caused roughly 4,000 employees to lose their jobs and a rollback of many of the regulations that Obama put in place. When questioned about global warming during his senate confirmation hearing, Zinke replied, \\"...I don't know definitively, there's a lot of debate on both sides of the aisle.\\" In January 2019, Zinke was replaced with David Bernhardt, an attorney and oil industry lobbyist who had been serving as Trump's United States Deputy Secretary of the Interior since 2017. At his confirmation hearing, speaking regarding his policy decisions related to global warming he said, \\"We’re going to look at the science whatever it is, but ... policy decisions are made – this president ran and he won on a particular perspective.\\" During Bernhardt's tenure as deputy secretary and acting secretary, the department embarked on a program of deregulation and substantially increased fossil fuel sales on public land. In March 2019, Politico reported that heads of the oil industry lobbyist group Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) boasted about their ties to Bernhardt. Department of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, former governor of Georgia, was appointed Agriculture Secretary. His supporters say that his experience in agriculture and conservative views on immigration make him an appropriate choice. Perdue says that he plans to rid the department of \\"onerous regulations\\" that do not contribute to a better environment. Opponents fear that he will not sufficiently address the effects that farm pollution has on sources of drinking water. Speaking on climate change, Perdue says that he agrees that the climate is warming but \\"we don't know definitively in my opinion what is causing climate change.\\" Council on Environmental Quality The Council on Environmental Quality is a division of the Executive Office of the President that coordinates federal environmental efforts and works closely with agencies and other White House offices on the development of environmental and energy policies and initiatives. In October 2017, Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White, former chair of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, to be chair of CEQ. Some of Hartnett's energy views have been considered controversial. She has \\"called renewable energy unreliable and parasitic\\" and she has \\"suggested that climate regulation is a conspiracy pushed by communists.\\" Her nomination was withdrawn in February 2018 as she did not garner enough support in the Senate. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Trump nominated Barry Lee Myers to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA is a scientific agency within the United States Department of Commerce that warns of dangerous weather, focuses on the conditions of the atmosphere, oceans and major waterways, and guides the use and protection of ocean and coastal resources. Myers is an attorney and businessman who has served as CEO of AccuWeather, a company that provides commercial weather forecasting services. In the past, he has strongly advocated against NOAA's capability to provide a weather information service directly to the public via the National Weather Service. Myers nomination has not been confirmed and Neil Jacobs has been serving as active under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere since February 25, 2019, following Timothy Gallaudet and Benjamin Friedman. In what came to be known as Sharpiegate, in September 2019, President Trump incorrectly stated that the path of Hurricane Dorian would include Alabama. Rather than correct his mistake he went on to frequently claim he was correct and on September 4 he held a news conference in which he held up a map which showed the expected path of the hurricane with a black sharpie extension that included Alabama. On September 6, under Jacob's leadership, NOAA released a statement that backed Trump's false claim. An investigation of the incident found that Jacob had twice violated codes of the agency’s scientific integrity policy. Secretary of State In March 2018, President Trump nominated Mike Pompeo as his new secretary of state (succeeding Rex Tillerson). Pompeo has referred to the Obama administration's environment and climate change plans as \\"damaging\\" and \\"radical\\". He opposes the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and supports eliminating the United States federal register of greenhouse gas emissions. He has stated, \\"Federal policy should be about the American family, not worshipping a radical environmental agenda.\\" In 2012 he called for the permanent elimination of wind power production tax credits calling them an \\"enormous government handout\\". In 2015 he voted against the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan resolution. In 2019 Pompeo refused to sign on to a joint statement addressing the need for protection of the Arctic region from the threat of rapidly melting ice unless all mentions of climate change were removed from the document. He stated \\"climate change is actually good for the Arctic, since melting ice caps are 'opening up new shipping routes' and thus making it more economically viable to expand oil drilling in the region.\\" Domestic energy policy Deregulation Trump unveiled what he calls the \\"America First Energy Plan\\" soon after his inauguration. His administration claimed that American business \\"has been held back by burdensome regulations on [its] energy industry\\". The \\"America First\\" plan emphasizes fossil fuels and does not mention renewable energy. His main focus has been on environmental rules imposed or proposed during the Obama administration. He has portrayed himself as a champion of the environment, fighting for clean air and water while his critics say that his policies have shown the opposite of what he has claimed. The Trump administration estimates deregulation will increase wages by over $30 billion by 2024. This figure specifically refers to the removal of Obama's Climate Action Plan and was drawn from a study from the Institute for Energy Research, a conservative non- profit organization specializing in research of global energy markets; the report actually based that figure on increased oil drilling on federal land and offshore, not on reduction of regulations. When Trump took office the EPA focused on a range of topics including air, emergency management, land and cleanup, pesticides, toxic substances, waste, and water. Trump said he would refocus its efforts to solely protect clean air and clean water. This has resulted in a 31% proposed budget cut to the EPA. Environmentalists, current EPA staff members, and former EPA staff members believe that the EPA would have a harder time upholding environmental standards with a smaller budget. In a 2018 analysis, David Cutler and Francesca Dominici of Harvard University stated that under the most conservative estimate, the Trump administration's rollbacks and proposed reversals of environmental rules would likely \\"cost the lives of over 80 000 US residents per decade and lead to respiratory problems for many more than 1 million people.\\" The EPA responded to the analysis by stating \\"This is not a scientific article, it’s a political article.\\" =Water use reduction programs= In 2006 the EPA launched the WaterSense program to reduce water use of fixtures such as toilets. WaterSense certified toilets, for example, use only 1.28 gallons per flush, 20% less than the current federal standard of 1.6 gallons. Other fixtures and appliances can be WaterSense certified as well. In December 2019, after meeting with small business owners Trump announced he had ordered a federal review of water efficiency standards pertaining to bathroom fixtures. He said it was “common sense” to review standards which resulted in showers with water “quietly dripping out”, toilets that end up using more water because \\"people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times as opposed to once\\" and sink water faucets with such a diminished flow that it takes twice as long to wash one's hands. At their website the EPA states that \\"recent advancements have allowed toilets to use 1.28 gallons per flush or less while still providing equal or superior performance.\\" In December 2019, Trump said \\"women tell me\\" they have to run modern dishwashers more than once to get clean dishes. =Renewable energy policy= In 2016 it was reported that America currently had 264 billion barrels of oil reserves, the largest oil reserve of any nation. The United States also has a vast amount of coal reserves, amounting to 26% of the world's total, more than any other nation. Its untapped oil and coal resources are estimated to be worth about $50 trillion according to the Trump administration. However, reports from the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) show that coal consumption in the US has steadily declined by about 20% over the last 10 years, with natural gas and renewable energy quickly taking over. Christina Simeone, director of policy and external affairs with the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, says that strict regulations aren't the only reason for the faltering coal market; natural gas has now become a cheaper option. Trump wants America to achieve energy independence from OPEC and all nations hostile to the interests of the United States to ensure national security, and insulate it from any supply disruptions and price fluctuations from the global oil market. However, fossil fuels are finite, and entities such as the Pentagon claim climate change also poses a threat to national security. The NRDC has argued that a more reliable long term solution would be to develop more of a reliance on renewable energy rather than maintaining a reliance on fossil fuels. The America First Energy Plan does not mention renewable energy and instead reflects the president's focus on fossil fuels. During the campaign, Trump praised solar technology during a rally in California the summer of 2016 but then criticized it for being too expensive and has since complained about the subsidies renewable energy companies receive. In June 2017, Trump said in a White House meeting that the wall with Mexico should be covered with solar panels. The statement was not taken seriously. The Trump administration's 2019 budget proposes large cuts in programs that research renewable energy and that study the effects of and ways to mitigate climate change. 2018 US wind farms Wind power is one of the fastest job-growing industries in the country and it is producing a substantial amount of power in some areas; for example, 25% of the energy in Iowa and North and South Dakota is from the wind. Minnesota, which ranks 7th in the nation at 18%, plans to shut down all of its coal-fired plants by 2030 and switch to renewable energy for all of its power needs. Trump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that noise from windmills causes cancer. He has also repeatedly said that they cause avian deaths, which is true. The US Fish and Wildlife Service reports that up to 300,000 birds a year are killed by windmills; however, they say that that number is low compared to other sources: \\"Communication towers kill 40 million, power lines kill 140 million, and cats kill hundreds of millions.\\" Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (shown above) resumed under the Trump administration The construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access had been placed on hold by then-president Barack Obama, who considered it a major contributor to climate change due to the greenhouse gas intensive extraction of oil from tar sands. After months of protest, in December 2016 the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) under the Obama administration announced that it would not grant an easement for the pipeline to be drilled under Lake Oahe and that USACE was undertaking an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes. Many Sioux tribes said that the pipeline threatens the tribe's environmental and economic well- being, and that it has damaged and destroyed sites of great historic, religious, and cultural significance. The tribe has expressed concern about leaks because the pipeline passes under Lake Oahe, which serves as a major source of water. Protests at pipeline construction sites in North Dakota began in the spring of 2016 and drew indigenous people from throughout North America as well as many other supporters, creating the largest gathering of Native Americans in the past hundred years. An executive order reviving the plans for the pipelines was signed by Trump on January 24, 2017, with the hopes of creating jobs and bolstering domestic energy production. The pipeline became commercially operational on June 1, 2017 In September 2018, the Dakota Access pipeline was estimated to have created 51 permanent jobs across the four states that it passes through. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued and in March 2020 a federal judge sided with the tribe and ordered USACE to do a full environmental impact statement. The Judge found the existing impact statement extremely lacking, noting numerous factors that had not been taken into account or were clearly not accurate. In July 2020, saying federal officials failed to carry out a complete analysis of its environmental impacts, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that the pipeline must be shut down by August 5. Pipeline owner Energy Transfer appealed and on August 5, the Court of Appeals sided with Energy Transfer to allow the pipeline to stay open. However the court did not grant Energy Transfer's motion to block the review, which must continue. Executive order on climate change Amid protests, on March 28, 2017, Trump signed a \\"sweeping executive order\\" instructing EPA \\"regulators to rewrite key rules curbing U.S. carbon emissions and other environmental regulations.\\" Trump was accompanied by \\"coal miners and coal executives\\" among others and he devoted his remarks on the executive order to \\"praising coal miners, pipelines and U.S. manufacturing.\\" He addressed the coal-miners directly, \\"Come on, fellas. Basically, you know what this is? You know what it says, right? You’re going back to work.\\" A Trump official said that the executive order plans to put American jobs first by not supporting climate change policies that place the economy at risk. Auto fuel economy and emissions standards More than 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. come from light-duty trucks and cars. The Obama administration 2012 fuel economy plan called for a doubling in fuel economy for new cars and light trucks, to more than by 2025, equivalent to a real-world average of . In April 2018, saying \\"those standards are inappropriate and should be revised,” Scott Pruitt announced that the EPA was rolling back the Obama administration's fuel efficiency and emissions standards. Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer expressed his concern. The state of California has a waiver that allows it to set its own auto emissions standards, which it has used to combat smog and, more recently, global warming. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia have adopted the California standards as their own. Arguing that the Pruitt plan violates the federal Clean Air Act and doesn't follow the agency's own regulations, in April California sued the Trump administration. Joining California were Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia. All have Democratic attorneys general. While automakers sought a relaxation of emission control requirements, they found the Trump rollback proposal extreme and were concerned it would split the American car market into two regulatory regimes. In July 2019, four automakers —Ford, Honda, Volkswagen Group of America and BMW of North America – rejected the Trump rule proposal and adopted the California emission standards. Shortly thereafter, the Department of Justice began an antitrust investigation of these four companies on the basis that working the deal together may have restricted consumer choice. By February 2020, the DOJ announced it had ended the investigation with no action. In April 2018, the administration announced plans to undo the Obama administration's auto fuel efficiency and emissions standards. In September 2019, Trump announced he planned to roll back the California waiver. State attorney general Xavier Becerra said Trump had “no basis and no authority” to revoke the waiver. In a statement, Governor Gavin Newsom said, \\"It’s a move that could have devastating consequences for our kids’ health and the air we breathe if California were to roll over. We will fight this latest attempt and defend our clean car standards.\\" On April 1, 2020, the administration released its final rule on mileage standards through 2026. In a statement EPA head Andrew Wheeler said, \\"We are delivering on President Trump’s promise to correct the current fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards.\\" The administration says the less stringent mileage standards will allow consumers to continue to buy the less fuel-efficient SUVs that U.S. drivers have favored for years. It is expected that states and environmental groups will challenge the Trump rules, and a U.S. District Court will likely issue a temporary order shelving them until it decides whether they are legal. Rollback of efficient lighting regulations In September 2019, the Energy Department announced the reversal of a 2014 regulation that would have taken effect on January 1, 2020, and implemented the last round of energy-saving light bulb regulations outlined by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for General Service Incandescent Lamps 10 CFR Part 430, EERE-2019-BT-STD-0022, RIN 1904-AE76 A spokesperson for the Alliance to Save Energy disputed the Department's regulations, saying that an average American household's lighting cost would increase by about $100 a year. The spokesperson also said that using less efficient light bulbs would require the electricity produced by 25 coal power plants. The ruling would allow some types of incandescent bulbs to remain in service. The U.S. states of California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington, and Vermont adopted their own energy standards. The California law was challenged in court by light bulb manufacturers but a judge ruled it was proper under the congressional exemption previously granted. Proposed EPA budget cuts People's Climate March in Washington DC - 2017 While campaigning for office Trump had proposed the idea of eliminating the EPA in order to help balance the United States' budget. Trump said, \\"We're going to have little tidbits left but we're going to get most of it out\\". Following his election, in March 2017, he announced plans to cut the EPA 2018 budget by 31%, by far the largest budget cut to any federal agency. The cut would result in a loss of 19% of the workforce or roughly 3,200 employees, through both staff buyouts and layoffs. The choice to remove the Clean Power Plan, which was put in place to reduce carbon dioxide emissions chiefly from coal-fired power plants, would effectively eliminate Obama's efforts to curb climate change. This plan would also remove the $100 million allocated to fund research combating climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides $250 million for programs which aid countries with high risk of impacts from rising and increasingly warm and acidic sea water levels. These programs would be eliminated under the new set of budget cuts. If enacted, this would mean the elimination of up to 38 of the agency's programs. Programs to be eliminated included the radon program, grants to clean up industrial sites (\\"brownfields\\"), climate change research, and the Office of Environmental Justice. Trump's objectives include the lifting of regulations from various energy industries to boost domestic energy production. Trump asked American manufacturers which regulations made production the most difficult. The industry leaders responded, and an overwhelming number of them recommended lifting restrictions related to the environment and workers' rights. In an open letter to Scott Pruitt, Mustafa Ali, former head of the EPA's Environmental Justice Program who resigned in protest to Pruitt's budget cuts, expressed concerns with how the budget cuts will effect pollution in poor and minority neighborhoods. The administration said it planned to refocus the EPA mission on clean water, air, and other core responsibilities. It also planned to delegate more of the EPA's enforcement activities to the states, while decreasing the amount of money given to states for that purpose by 30%. Issues like greenhouse gas emissions would be trimmed significantly or eliminated from the budget. On September 12, 2018, the Senate approved a so-called \\"Minibus funding bill\\" or \\"Omnibus spending bill,\\" which reduced the EPA's budget from $8.2 billion annually to $5.7 billion, a decrease of $2.5 billion or -31%. The bill was expected to eliminate more than 50 programs and 3,200 jobs, discontinue funding for international climate- change programs, cut funding for the Office of Research and Development in half, cut funding for the Superfund cleanup program and the Office of Enforcement and Compliance, and prioritizes drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects. Department of the Interior The Department of the Interior is responsible for the management and conservation of natural resources, most federal lands such as national parks and forests, wildlife refuges and tribal territories. Trump accused President Obama of “denying millions of Americans access to the energy wealth sitting under our feet” by his leasing restrictions and the banning new coal extraction on federal lands. Trump campaigned on a promise to “unleash America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in clean coal reserves.” Trump's proposed 2018 budget aimed to cut $1.5 billion of funding from the Department of Interior. In a White House speech in 2019, Trump hailed \\"America’s environmental leadership\\" under his watch, asserting his administration was \\"being good stewards of our public land,\\" reducing carbon emissions and promoting the \\"cleanest air\\" and \\"crystal clean\\" water. Experts noted that the cited achievements were the result of actions taken by his predecessors going all the way back to the Nixon administration. Trump appointed Congressman Ryan Zinke of Montana as Secretary of the Interior. Zinke is an advocate for mining and logging on federal lands. Commenting on the Trump presidency, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, a Washington DC-based lobby group, said, \\"This opportunity is unique, maybe once in a lifetime,” in regards to increased access to federal leases. The Trump administration stated plans to open up more federal land for energy development, such as fracking and drilling. The Clean Water Rule, issued by the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers in 2015, was also a target for possible repeal. The rule clarifies the federal government's jurisdiction to protect small streams and wetlands from pollution. Developers, business, and agriculture groups oppose the rule because they believe that their private property rights are violated and that undue regulatory burdens are created. In January 2018, the EPA formally suspended the 2015 regulation and announced plans to issue a new version later in 2018. Fifteen states, two cities and several environmental organizations have challenged EPA's suspension in several lawsuits. On September 12, 2019, the Trump administration repealed the Clean Water Rule.  Tongass National Forest  Misty Fjords Waterfall In August 2019, Trump had instructed Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to exempt Alaska's Tongass National Forest from logging restrictions established nearly 20 years ago during the Clinton administration. The move opens it to potential logging and energy and mining projects. Tongass is the world's largest intact temperate rainforest, containing old-growth cedar, hemlock and spruce, fjords and rivers with salmon runs. It serves as an enormous natural carbon sink, holding an estimated 8% of all carbon stored in U.S. national forests. Unlike most other national forests, most of the forest is in a natural condition. The Forest Service had finalized a plan to phase out old-growth logging in 2016 and Congress had designated more than 5.7 million acres of the forest as wilderness, not to be developed under any circumstances. Should Trump's plan be successful, it could affect 9.5 million acres. On September 25, 2020, the Trump administration submitted a revised environmental impact study which recommended a \\"full exemption\\" for the Tongass, opening the forest to more development and logging. Responding, Andy Moderow of the Alaska Wilderness League said that Tongass plays an important role in helping to combat climate change noting that it \\"stores more than 400 million metric tons of CO2 and sequesters an additional 3 million metric tons annually, equivalent to taking nearly 650,000 cars off the road each year.\\" If elected, presidential candidate Joe Biden could reverse the decision. Proposed Alaska gold and copper mine In July 2020, Trump reversed the Obama administration's decision that the Pebble Mine proposal for an Alaska gold and copper mining operation would permanently harm the region's sockeye salmon fisheries. The Washington Post called the Trump decision typical of the administration's \\"whiplash\\" decisions which have \\"methodically dismantled many of his predecessor’s actions on climate change, conservation and pollution.\\" The Alaska Bristol Bay Pebble Mine proposal has been opposed by 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is a wilderness area in the state of Minnesota. In 2018, the Trump administration cleared the way for renewed mineral leasing within the watershed of the BWCA. The Obama administration had proposed a 20-year mining ban and asked for an environmental study based on concerns that mining in the Boundary Waters watershed could lead to irreversible harm to the BWCA. Environmentalists have challenged the reversal of the decisions in federal court.  Hunting  The International Wildlife Conservation Council (IWCC) was created under the Department of the Interior to loosen restrictions around importing endangered wildlife hunting trophies like heads and skins. After a judge ruled in February 2020 that the council's legitimacy could be challenged in court, the Department of the Interior told the judge that the council's charter had already ended and would not be renewed. In June 2020, the administration changed a five-year-old Obama-era rule to allow, once again, hunters on federal land in Alaska to use food to lure bears out of hibernation; to use artificial light to enter wolf dens; and to shoot animals from planes, boats, and snowmobiles. National monuments In April 2017, President Trump directed the Department of the Interior to review 27 monuments of at least in size through Executive Order 13792. The vast majority of the lands under review were set aside by President Obama. In June 2017, Zinke issued an interim report as requested in the executive order. He proposed a scaling back of the Bears Ears National Monument. In August 2017, Zinke delivered a final report to Trump. The report called for the reduction of Bears Ears (established by Obama – 2016), Cascade–Siskiyou (Clinton – 2000), Gold Butte (Obama – 2016), Grand Staircase-Escalante (Clinton – 1996), Pacific Remote Islands Marine (Bush – 2006), and Rose Atoll Marine (Bush – 2009). =Bear's Ears Monument= Indian Creek and the Sixshooter Peaks with the Bear's Ears in the background. The names are listed in the presidential proclamation as \\"Hoon’Naqvut, Shash Jáa, Kwiyagatu Nukavachi, Ansh An Lashokdiwe\\"—all four mean \\"Bears Ears\\". Bears Ears National Monument, located in southeastern Utah, was established by presidential proclamation by Barack Obama in 2016. Five native American tribes urged Obama to create the monument to preserve about 9,000 recorded archaeological sites, including petroglyphs, woven cloth, human remains and ancient roads. In 2017 Donald Trump reduced it by 85%. Members of the Navajo tribe in particular were integral to the monument's passage. A tribal spokesperson stated that a reduction in the size of the Bear's Ears Monument would be \\"an attack on a significant part of the foundation of American conservation law.\\" A different opinion was offered by Republican Utah state representative Mike Noel who sees a shrinking of the Bears Ears Monument as a victory over federal restrictions over mining and animal grazing. \\"When you turn the management over to the tree-huggers, the bird and bunny lovers and the rock lickers, you turn your heritage over.\\" Legal scholars have argued that the reduction is not authorized by law and several federal lawsuits have been filed challenging Trump's action. They contend that the Trump administration stacked the Federal Advisory Committee Act committee, which is supposed to be balanced and not unduly influenced by the financial interests of its members, with politicians and ranchers with a conflict of interest. An attorney who works with Democracy Forward commented, \\"The Bears Ears committee was designed to protect a treasure of the American West and stacking it with opponents of the monument could violate federal law.\\" =Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument= On June 5, 2020, President Trump signed a proclamation that opened the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, the Atlantic Ocean’s only fully protected marine sanctuary, to commercial fishing. In 2016 the Obama administration created the monument, an area of nearly 5,000 square miles, to protect whales and other endangered species and to allow marine life to recover from overfishing. Soon after Trump took office he ordered his administration to review marine sanctuaries and Ryan Zinke, Interior Department Secretary at that time, met with fishermen and fishing industry groups that were attempting to overturn the Obama legislation. During a roundtable discussion held in Maine in June 2020, Trump met with Maine’s former governor Paul LePage, a Trump supporter, and commercial fishermen and signed an executive order to end the restrictions on commercial fishing. The current governor, Janet Mills, was not invited to the event. Responding to Trump's ruling a senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, an organization that works to protect endangered species, said, \\"Gutting these safeguards attacks the very idea of marine monuments.\\" Offshore drilling In January 2018, the Interior Department announced plans to allow drilling in nearly all U.S. waters. This would be the largest expansion of offshore oil and gas leasing ever proposed, and includes regions that were long off-limits to development and more than 100 million acres in the Arctic and the Eastern Seaboard, regions that President Obama had placed under a drilling moratorium.  Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling  Caribou herd - Arctic National Wildlife Refuge The Trump administration tax bill passed in December 2017 includes a provision introduced by Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski that requires Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to approve at least two lease sales for drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Scientists, environmentalists and former Interior Department officials have warned that fossil fuel extraction in the ANWR could harm the landscape and the species that live there. Polar bear sow and two cubs on the Beaufort Sea coast, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge In September 2019, the administration said they would like to see the entire coastal plain opened for gas and oil exploration, the most aggressive of the suggested development options. The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has filed a final environmental impact statement and plans to start granting leases by the end of the year. The area includes areas where caribou visit for calving and polar bears who have been driven to spend more of their time along the refuge's coastal plain due to melting ice caused by global warming have their dens. There are concerns for the Indigenous populations as well because many of them rely on subsistence hunting and fishing. In a review of the statement the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the BLM's final statement underestimated the climate impacts of the oil leases because they viewed global warming as cyclical rather than human-made. The administration's plan calls for \\"the construction of as many as four places for airstrips and well pads, 175 miles of roads, vertical supports for pipelines, a seawater-treatment plant and a barge landing and storage site.\\" On August 17, 2020, the Trump Administration finalized and announced its decision to open the ANWR to drilling. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, formerly an oil industry lobbyist, said that the administration's oil and gas leasing program could \\"create thousands of jobs\\" and \\"mark a new chapter in American energy independence.\\" Due to the fact that world markets are currently flooded bringing crude oil to historically low prices, that due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic the market for oil has collapsed, and since Trump took office in 2017 there has been an increased awareness of the need to combat global warming, it is unlikely that any drilling would soon begin. However, Trump's decision has been seen as a way to make the opening of the region to drilling harder to undo should a new administration be voted in in the November 2020 presidential election. Privatization of Native American reservations Within the Interior Department, the Bureau of Indian Affairs handles some federal relations with Native Americans. Native American reservations are estimated to contain about a fifth of the nation's oil and gas, along with vast coal reserves. In December 2016, a Trump advisory group put forth a plan to privatize Native American reservations to open them up to drilling and mining. Many Native Americans view such efforts as a violation of tribal self-determination and culture. Trump's transition team commissioned a Native American coalition to draw up a list of proposals to guide his Indian policy. According to a Reuters investigative report, \\"The backgrounds of the coalition’s leadership are one sign of its pro-drilling bent. At least three of four chair-level members have links to the oil industry.\\"  Endangered species threats In February 2018, Trump and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke presented their recommendation for the 2019 budget. It did not grant any funding for state efforts for the recovery of endangered species. The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, a program authorized by the Endangered Species Act, supports conservation planning, habitat restoration, land acquisition, research, and education. The administration justified the budget change saying that it “is not requesting funding for these activities in order to support higher priorities.” A senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity said gutting the fund would push endangered species toward extinction. “This is especially damaging because [the] funding is often the backbone of state non-game programs and helps animals across the country, from bats and butterflies to salmon and grizzlies.” The former director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who served during Obama's time in office said, “We were very proud of the record we set, that we had recovered and delisted more species than all previous administrations combined. And that didn’t happen by accident. It happened because we applied the resources to get species over that last mile.” In July 2018, more than two dozen pieces of \\"legislation, policy initiatives and amendments designed to weaken\\" the Endangered Species Act were introduced or voted on by congress. Former oil lobbyist David Bernhardt, the deputy interior secretary, led the push to review the endangered species act. Utah Republican representative Rob Bishop, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement. “We’re all aware that the Endangered Species Act hasn’t undergone any significant updates in over 40 years. Now is the time to modernize this antiquated law to simultaneously benefit both endangered species and the American people.” Bruce Babbitt, who served as the interior secretary under the Clinton administration, commented, \\"This is the first time that we’ve seen an orchestrated effort by the president, the Republican leaders in the House, the industry and the Interior Department all working together in a concentrated effort to eviscerate the act.\\" Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists, commented, \\"I think the Endangered Species Act is endangered. They haven’t been able to do this for 20 years, but this looks like their one chance.” In August 2019, the Department of Interior announced a list of major changes to the Endangered Species Act. Industry groups and Republican lawmakers applauded the proposed changes while critics expressed concerns as they are coming at a time of crisis when as many as one million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction. Numerous state attorneys general and environmental groups have said that they will sue the administration over the changes, alleging they are illegal because they're not grounded in scientific evidence. =Mexico border wall concerns= Male jaguar from the Santa Rita Mountains, Arizona, in 2015 President Donald Trump's signature campaign promise was the construction of a big wall on the southern border. The administration has described the project as including a 30 ft-tall concrete and steel \\"big, beautiful wall\\", a 150 ft 'enforcement zone' which will be kept clear of vegetation, and a road. Critical habitats are on the border with Mexico in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 and candidates for that list from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service includes ninety-three species whose ranges are near or cross the border. Trump's proposed border wall will block the movement of threatened wildlife and interfere with the movement of animals in response to climate change and could prevent genetic exchange. Among the threatened species are the jaguar (the largest cat native to North America), the ocelot ( cats that could be making a comeback), the Mexican wolf (the smallest gray wolf in North America), the Sonoran pronghorn (related to giraffes, they can run and are North America's fastest land mammals), the tiny cactus ferruginous pygmy owl (who fly at about , lower than the wall), and the Quino checkerspot butterfly (who fly no higher than ). In July 2018, citing \\"bypassed environmental laws, habitat destruction, and losses to conservation and scientific research\\", in a report published in the scientific journal BioScience thousands of scientists \\"expressed alarm\\" over the expansion of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The report has 16 co-authors and as of July 24, 2,700, signatures from almost 50 countries. In December 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling which allowed the Trump administration to waive federal environmental protection laws to construct a border wall cutting through the National Butterfly Center in Mission, Texas. The center has been called the most diverse butterfly sanctuary in the country. Habitat restoration has also attracted birds which can not be seen anywhere else in the continental U.S. The wall will also slice through the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge and the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park. =Yellowstone grizzly= Yellowstone Grizzly Grizzly bears in the Lower 48 States were placed on the endangered list in 1975 because they had lost 98 percent of their historical range and the Yellowstone-area population had dropped to fewer than 140 bears. In June 2017, the Trump administration announced a decision to remove protections for Yellowstone grizzly bears under the Endangered Species Act. They argued that the population had sufficiently recovered from the threat of extinction, however numerous conservation and tribal organizations argued that the grizzly population remained genetically vulnerable. Numerous tribes revere the grizzly as sacred and they and environmentalists expressed fears about trophy hunts, livestock and logging interests, and the gas, coal, and oil extraction industries. They sued the administration (Crow Tribe et al v. Zinke) and in September 2018 they won their lawsuit and on July 30, 2019, the Yellowstone grizzly was officially returned to federal protection. At a hearing on August 1, 2019, Congresswoman Liz Cheney, Republican from Wyoming which is one of the states affected by the ruling, stated that the successful litigation by the tribes and environmentalists \\"was not based on science or facts” but motivated by plaintiffs “intent on destroying our Western way of life.\\" =Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918= Bird populations are rapidly decreasing. Since 1970 the U.S. and Canada have lost some 3 billion birds, a decline attributed to habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. In June 2020 it was announced that the Trump administration plans to lift protections that have been in place for more than a century. The Trump plan includes easing penalties on companies that accidentally kill birds, such as in an oil spill. The new proposal would only punish oil and gas and construction companies if they intentionally kill birds. A study done by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shows that \\"As the legal certainty increases, fewer entities would likely implement best practices ... resulting in increased bird mortality.\\" Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the analysis “a cynical effort” to justify a policy that is “clearly bad for birds, clearly cruel and inconsistent with the MBTA in every way.” Regulation of hazardous chemicals It has been charged that the Trump administration has attempted to change the way the federal government evaluates hazardous chemicals that may pose a risk to human health, making them more aligned with the chemical industry's wishes. Trump appointed Nancy B. Beck as a top deputy of the EPA's toxic chemical unit, while during her previous five years she had been an executive at the industry trade association American Chemistry Council for American chemical companies. Shortly after her appointment in May 2017, Beck rewrote, among others, the regulations covering the chemical, perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, which has been linked to many serious health problems. Her revisions make it harder to track the health consequences of the chemical, and therefore harder to regulate. =Pesticides= In March 2017, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt denied that he had met with Dow Chemicals CEO Andrew Liveris before making a decision to deny a petition to ban Dow's chlorpyrifos pesticide that had been initiated by the Obama administration. Research has concluded that even minuscule amounts of chlorpyrifos can disrupt the development of fetuses and infants. In August, it was revealed that in fact Pruitt and other EPA officials had met with industry representatives on dozens of occasions in the weeks immediately prior to the March decision, promising them that it was \\"a new day\\" and assuring them that their wish to continue using chlorpyrifos had been heard. Ryan Jackson, Pruitt's chief of staff, said in a March 8 email that he had \\"scared\\" career staff into going along with the political decision to deny the ban, adding \\"[T]hey know where this is headed and they are documenting it well.\\" Emails also indicated that the decision was closely coordinated with the White House and the Department of Agriculture. Following the decision, the American Academy of Pediatrics said they were \\"deeply alarmed\\" and urged Pruitt to take chlorpyrifos off the market saying, \\"There is a wealth of science demonstrating the detrimental effects of chlorpyrifos exposure to developing fetuses, infants, children and pregnant women. The risk to infant and children's health and development is unambiguous.\\" Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, the agency's previous top official overseeing pesticides and toxic chemicals, said she first felt concern when the EPA's new leadership decided to reevaluate a plan to ban methylene chloride, and trichloroethylene, two chemicals that have caused deaths and severe health problems. “It was extremely disturbing to me. The industry met with EPA political appointees. And then I was asked to change the agency’s stand.” In March 2017, Hamnett was again instructed to ignore the recommendation of EPA scientists and deny the ban of chlorpyrifos. Hamnett retired in September and was replaced by a toxicologist who has spent years helping businesses fight EPA restrictions. In 2017, a coalition of attorneys general for several states, farm workers, and environmental groups sued then-EPA chief Scott Pruitt over his chlorpyrifos ban reversal. Saying that the EPA had \\"violated federal law by ignoring the conclusions of agency scientists that chlorpyrifos is harmful,\\" on August 9, 2018, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ordered the EPA to remove chlorpyrifos from sale in the United States within 60 days. In July 2019, the EPA announced it would not ban chlorpyrifos. The US EPA had also recently taken a variety of actions to regulate the use of neonicotinoids, pesticides linked to declining bee numbers. In 2014, under the Obama presidency, a blanket ban was issued against the use of neonicotinoids in National Wildlife Refuges in response to concerns about off-target effects, and a lawsuit from environmental groups. In 2018, the Trump administration reversed this decision, stating that decisions on neonicotinoid usage on farms in wildlife refuges will be made on a case by case basis. The Trump decision also ended the policy of prohibiting large tracts of land to be used for the growing of biotech crops such as corn and soybeans in the refuges. =Lead paint standards= According to the EPA, lead poisoning is the number one environmental health threat for children ages 6 and younger. No new standards have been set since 2001, though it is agreed that the old standards need to be updated. In December 2017, after Pruitt requested six more years to regulate lead levels, a divided federal appeals court issued a writ of mandamus ordering Pruitt to regulate lead within the next 90 days. The Court called the lead paint risks for children \\"severe\\". =PFOS and PFOA study publication withheld= Using information gained through a Freedom of Information Act request, in May 2018 it was learned that January 2018 emails between the EPA, the White House, and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) showed an apparent decision to withhold the results of a study done by the DHHS Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) that was planned for publication. Looking at the chemicals widely known as PFOS and PFOA, the study showed that they endanger human health at a far lower level than EPA has previously called safe. They have been found to contaminate several areas, reaching water supplies near military bases, chemical plants, and other sites in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. One White House email said, “The public, media, and Congressional reaction to these numbers is going to be huge. The impact to EPA and [the Defense Department] is going to be extremely painful. We (DoD and EPA) cannot seem to get ATSDR to realize the potential public relations nightmare this is going to be.” When questioned about the release of the study the White House referred questions to DHHS, which confirmed that the study has no scheduled release date. Pruitt's chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, defended EPA's decision to withhold the results of the study to “ensure that the federal government is responding in a uniform way to our local, state, and Congressional constituents and partners.” Members of Congress had a very strong reaction to the release of information regarding the withholding of the study, including Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, Representative Peter Welch, and Senator Patrick Leahy. Pruitt conceded that his agency should take \\"concrete action\\" related to chemicals like PFAS, but testified that he was unaware of any delay in the release of the study.Legal defense fund in place — Pruitt , E&E; News, Kevin Bogardus, May 16, 2018. Retrieved May 17, 2018. On May 16 Pruitt announced a “leadership summit” on PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals scheduled for the following week. When the \\"invitation only\\" leadership summit was held on May 22 and 23, news agencies, including Politico, E&E; News, and CNN were initially barred from the hearing. An Associated Press journalist was told she was not on the invitation list and forcibly removed from the room. CNN commented, \\"We understand the importance of an open and free press and we hope the EPA does, too,” Jahan Wilcox, speaking for the EPA, justified the agency's actions by claiming the summit was not a “federal advisory committee event, ” to which the public would be entitled to access, but instead was an opportunity “for EPA’s state, tribal, and federal government partners and national organizations to share a range of individual perspectives” regarding PFASs.For Second Day, Reporters Barred From EPA Event On Toxic Chemicals , Talking Points Memo, Matt Shuham, May 23, 2018. Retrieved May 24, 2018. Senator Tom Udall, the ranking Democrat on a committee with oversight of EPA, did not agree. He sent a letter to Pruitt saying \\"Clean drinking water is a public health issue that does not belong behind closed doors.” Toxic waste clean-up In attempts to lift regulations on oil, mining, drilling, and farming industries, the Trump administration proposed a 31% budget cut to the EPA that would result in reduced initiatives to protect water and air quality, leaving much of the effort up to the states. Environmentalists fear that these cuts will result in health problems. EPA budget cuts are also expected to lead to decreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing (fracking), which would result in less federal oversight of clean- up projects in these areas. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt hired former Oklahoma banker Albert Kelly to head the Superfund program, which is responsible for cleaning up the nation's most contaminated land. Kelly completely lacked any experience with environmental issues, and had just received a lifetime ban from working in banking, his career until then. Clean water legislation =Rollback of Obama administration regulations= Much of the Trump administration's efforts to decrease pollution regulation involved directly rescinding or overturning pollution regulations enacted under the Obama administration. In February 2017, Trump signed a resolution overturning President Obama's Stream Protection Rule, after being in effect for less than 30 days. When he signed the resolution repealing the rule, Trump predicted that striking down the rule would save thousands of U.S. mining-related jobs. The administration has also proposed a rollback on the Obama administration's extension of federal jurisdiction over lands protected by the Clean Water Act in attempts to reduce water pollution in areas surrounding toxic waste facilities. =Great Lakes Restoration Initiative= During Trump's first year in office he called for eliminating the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, initiated by President Obama, and in the following two years he called for a 90% cut to the program. However Congress overruled him, giving the program $300 million each year. In 2019 he cut the program from $300 million to just $30 million. In March 2019, speaking at a rally in Michigan, which borders Lake Michigan, he commented: > I support the Great Lakes. Always have. They are beautiful. They are big, > very deep. Record deepness, right? And I am going to get, in honor of my > friends, full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration > Initiative which you have been trying to get for over 30 years. So, we will > get it done. =Clean Water Rule= Soon after taking office, on February 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order to allow the EPA administrator to revise or rescind the Obama era Clean Water Rule, also referred to as Waters of the United States (WOTUS). The executive order cited a need to pursue \\"economic growth\\" and to avoid \\"regulatory uncertainty.\\" The Obama rule placed pollution limits on about 60 percent of the nation's bodies of water, protecting both large bodies of water and the tributaries, streams, and wetlands that drain into them. Research cited by the EPA shows that one in three Americans get their water from public drinking water systems which are partly sourced from streams protected by the Clean Water Rule. These streams may be in danger of pollution by industrial and agricultural waste, sewage, radioactive materials and a large number of other pollutants now covered by the Clean Water Rule. The Audubon Society has expressed concerns about a repeal of the Rule. They write at their website: \\"...the Trump administration’s intent is clear: to reverse Obama-era environmental protections no matter what, even if they have been effective at protecting avian and human life.\\" On September 12, 2019, the Trump administration repealed the Clean Water Rule. =Clean Water Act= On April 10, 2019, President Trump issued two executive orders aimed at boosting the production of fossil fuels by cutting back on regulations he sees as\\"unnecessary red tape\\". The new regulations benefit energy companies by making it more difficult for states to block projects such as oil pipelines by using the Clean Water Act. Currently under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, states can reject any project if they believe it could impact the state's water. Under Trump's order any decisions related to permits will no longer be made by the state secretary, but by the president. On April 23, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund that the federal Clean Water Act applies to pollution of underground water that flows into nearby bodies of water and streams. The Trump administration argued that the law didn’t apply to groundwater. The decision came after a sewage treatment plant in Hawaii claimed that the law covered only “point sources” of pollution, such as an effluent pipe. Following months of investigation it was shown that the treatment plant was contaminating underground water which was seeping into the nearby ocean bay and harming sealife. The case was argued by Earth Justice; it was widely watched as a technical test case for future decisions related to the Clean Water Act.https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/04/opinion-analysis- opinion-analysis-the-justices-purpose-full-reading-of-the-clean-water-act/ In June 2020, the EPA finalized a rule which will end the long-standing rights of states, tribes and the public to object to federal permits for projects that could pollute waterways. The energy industry sees the change as a way to speed up oil pipelines and other projects, while environmentalists are concerned that it could undercut state and tribal efforts to safeguard rivers and drinking water. =New lead standards= Saying \\"We are delivering on the president’s commitment that all Americans have access to clean and safe drinking water,\\" on October 10, 2019, the administration announced their proposals for new regulations on lead and copper in drinking water. The draft plan includes requirements that water utilities disclose inventories of lead service pipes and requires that daycare centers and schools report elevated lead levels within 24 hours rather than the current standard of 30 days. However, environmental activists are critical of the relaxation of other standards that have been proposed that slow the timetable for the replacement of lead pipes found to contain high levels of lead, extending the replacement time from 7 percent of lead service lines each year to just 3 percent. The Natural Resources Defense Council calls the slower timetable for lead pipe replacement \\"a huge weakening change that will swallow up the few small improvements in the proposal.\\" Clean Air Act standards The Clean Air Act is a federal law designed to control air pollution on a national level. In June 2017, Pruitt announced that he would delay designating which areas met new National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone, a byproduct of pollutants from burning fossil fuels that has been linked to asthma. In August 2017, Pruitt said he would reverse that decision after being sued by 16 state attorneys general. In March 2018, Pruitt was finally ordered to do so by U.S. district judge Haywood Stirling Gilliam Jr. As of May 2020, the Trump administration is trying to roll back restrictions on ethylene oxide, a carcinogenic air pollutant. It is widely used to produce antifreeze, fumigate crops, and sterilize medical equipment. Coal emission standards On August 21, 2018, the Trump administration announced plans to cut back Obama's coal emissions standards for coal-fired power plants, calling them \\"overly prescriptive and burdensome.\\" The Trump plan increases the leeway given states to make their own decisions on coal emission standards, saying it \\"empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.\\" Critics say the proposal would allow states to run and extend the life of older less efficient power plants and use less stringent emission guidelines for establishing new plants. The New York Times reported in October 2019 that the Trump EPA planned to roll back or eliminate a 2015 limitation on coal-fired power plants releasing heavy metals like arsenic, lead and mercury into water supplies. In April 2020, the administration announced that the EPA had changed the way that they calculate the benefits of mercury controls. The changes will reduce the positive health effects of regulations on paper and raise their economic costs so as to loosen restrictions on any pollutant that the fossil fuel industry has deemed too costly to control. Environmental lawyers say that the new method will undermine the legal underpinnings of controls on mercury and many other pollutants. David Konisky, a professor of public and environmental affairs, said, \\"That is the big unstated goal. This is less about mercury than about potentially constraining or handcuffing future efforts by the E.P.A. to regulate air pollution.” Landscape conservation cooperatives Established under the Obama administration, Landscape conservation cooperatives (LCC) are research centers that address broad issues such as flooding, species extinction, and climate change. When Trump entered office he eliminated LCC funding in his budget proposals. However, following pressure from state fish and wildlife agencies, NGOs and tribal groups, Congress restored the LCC funding. In April 2019, it was reported that while Congress had set aside funding for LCC projects, the Trump administration had either closed 16 of the 22 research centers or put them on indefinite hiatus. Another six remain open receiving support from other sources.  Rollback of the National Environmental Policy Act  Trump has frequently criticized environmental rules calling them \\"burdensome\\" and responsible for slowing work on infrastructure projects. In January 2020, Trump proposed changes in the Environmental impact statement process (EIS) as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which was passed in 1969. NEPA changed environmental oversight in the U.S. by requiring federal agencies to consider whether a project would harm the air, land, water or wildlife. Thus, NEPA has prevented federal agencies from dividing large projects into smaller chunks to make the environmental impact appear to be insignificant. For example, the proposal for a forest road would require that the impact of logging that it was built to accommodate be evaluated as well. NEPA also requires that the public be allowed to review and provide input on proposals. Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups have voiced concerns that Trump's proposals would gut environmental protections and remove the public's right to know and make comments of project's potential harms to the environment. January 9, 2020 PBS NewsHour In June 2020, Trump further weakened standards when he signed an executive order to waive long-standing environmental laws and speed up approval for pipelines, highways, new mines, and other projects. On June 19 he declared that the corona virus epidemic had given rise to an economic \\"emergency\\" which evoked a section of federal law allowing \\"action with significant environmental impact\\" without observing normal requirements imposed by laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act or the Endangered Species Act.  Climate change  Although in the scientific literature there is overwhelming scientific consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases, neither Trump nor any of the department heads he has appointed believe that global warming is human- related. Speaking in a 2017 interview he stated, \\"You have scientists on both sides of it. My uncle was a great professor at MIT for many years, Dr. John Trump, and I didn’t talk to him about this particular subject, but I have a natural instinct for science, and I will say that you have scientists on both sides of the picture.\\" Calling himself \\"an environmentalist\\", he said, \\"Everything I want and everything I have is clean. Clean is very important – water, air. I want absolutely crystal clear water and I want the cleanest air on the planet and our air now is cleaner than it’s ever been. Very important to me.\\" Following Trump's election large amounts of climate information from the EPA website was altered or removed. There was widespread concern among environmentalists and scientists and a coalition of scientific and academic groups began to make copies of the EPA web pages before they were deleted. According to the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative which tracks changes to government websites under the Trump administration, over 200 web pages providing climate information were omitted during Trump's first year in office. Other pages were altered to remove mentions of climate and climate change. In August 2017, the Trump administration rolled back regulations that required the federal government to account for climate change and sea-level rise when building infrastructure. Responding to a 2018 government-funded study which warned of potentially catastrophic climate change impacts, Trump said he had read part of the report but did not believe it. In May 2019, The New York Times reported that the White House-appointed director of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), James Reilly, who has background in petroleum geology, ordered that the USGS only project impacts of climate change to 2040, instead of their previous practice of projecting to 2099. Thus, according to the Times, the 2022 National Climate Assessment, or other government reports on science, will not automatically include \\"such worst-case scenario projections\\". Models show that carbon emissions will only significantly change Earth's rate of warming around 2050. The Times also reported that the Trump administration is also planning to create a climate change review panel headed by William Happer, who is presently serving on Trump's United States National Security Council. Happer has repeatedly publicly stated, \\"the demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler.” In June 2019, Trump's White House reportedly tried to prevent a State Department intelligence analyst, Rod Schoonover, from testifying to Congress about \\"possibly catastrophic\\" effects of human-caused climate change. Trump's White House reportedly prevented Schoonover's written testimony from being included in the official Congressional Record because it \\"doesn't reflect the coordinated [intelligence committee] position, or the administration’s position\\". The National Security Council offered many criticisms of Schoonover's testimony, including a comment that \\"a consensus of peer reviewed literature has nothing to do with the truth.\\" The New York Times quoted two anonymous sources as saying that the comments came from William Happer, a denier of the scientific consensus on global warming. The White House Office of Legislative Affairs also reportedly proposed removing five pages of testimony about the \\"Scientific Baseline\\" regarding climate change and the \\"Stresses to Human and Societal Systems\\" posed by climate change. Schoonover resigned July 2019. In 2020, looking back at the Trump administration's first term policy changes, some environmentalists believe that a second Trump term would mean severe and irreversible changes in the climate. During the summer of 2020 numerous large fires burned thousands of acres with the loss of many homes and lives. Scientists report that they are related to climate changes which have increased the likelyhood of more fires that will burn more widely and intensely than in the past. Trump was briefed in September on the status of fires in California--more than two dozen were burning at that time. Wade Crowfoot, California's secretary for natural resources and other officials repeatedly urged him to consider the role of global warming. Trump replied, \\"It'll start getting cooler. You just — you just watch\\" and Crowfoot replied, \\"I wish science agreed with you.\\" Trump replied, \\"Well, I don't think science knows, actually.\\" Paris Climate Agreement  On June 1, 2017, Trump announced United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, causing the U.S. to become the third out of 197 nations worldwide to not sign the agreement. As of 2018 the remaining two nations signed and the U.S. is the only nation that has not ratified the Paris Agreement. Since the terms of the agreement prohibit any country from withdrawing during the first three years, the Trump decision to withdraw will not be finalized until November 2019 and then it will not become official for another year after that, the day after the 2020 presidential election. Prior to withdrawal, the U.S. had pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025 and assign $3 million in aid to foreign countries combating climate change. The withdrawal was supported by several Republican lawmakers who felt that backing out was in-line with Trump's \\"America First\\" policy and goals to diverge from the environmental policies of the Obama administration. The announcement has been criticized by many national and international leaders, domestic politicians, business leaders and academics, as well as a large majority of American citizens (7 out of 10 according to a study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication). Trump opposed the agreement on the grounds that it would compromise U.S. sovereignty and cause many Americans to lose their jobs. Proponents of the agreement argue, however, that backing out will result in a loss for our economy as new green jobs are offered instead to competitors overseas. Trump also announced his attempts to reach a negotiation with leaders involved in the agreement, who responded saying that the accord was \\"non-negotiable.\\" The process of withdrawal is expected to take several years, and in the meantime there has been a vocal resistance on the state and local levels. Hawaii became the first state to independently commit to the goals initially lined out by the accord. Shortly after Trump's announcement, state governments in California, New York, and Washington founded the United States Climate Alliance to continue advancing the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The sentiment has also been expressed by other state governors, by mayors and businesses, and the alliance now has 10 states with governors of both the Democratic and Republican parties pledging to abide by the agreement.New York Times, June 1, 2017, Bucking Trump, These Cities, States and Companies Commit to Paris Accord Additionally, shortly after withdrawal California governor Jerry Brown met personally with President Xi Jinping of China to declare the states' compliance with the Paris Accord. In September 2017, some administration officials stated that the administration remains open to staying in the agreement \\"under the right conditions.\\" Clean Power Plan The Clean Power Plan, first proposed in 2014, was an Obama administration policy aimed at combating global warming. The plan's goal was to move away from coal and instead use renewable energy or gas to generate electricity, which would reduce particulate matter in the environment. On March 1, 2017, Murray Energy Corporation sent a letter to the Trump administration with an Action Plan \\"which will help getting America's coal miners back to work.\\" Doing away with Obama's Clean Power Plan was at the top of the list. Their second priority was doing away with the \\"endangerment finding\\" (the legal and scientific foundation for climate action) in the Clean Air Act. Their third priority was the elimination of tax credits for solar panels and windmills, and fourth was the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord. Other suggestions included cutting back of EPA staffing to at least half. On March 28, 2017, Trump signed an executive order to withdraw and rewrite Obama's Clean Power Plan, aimed at reviving the coal mining industry and unburdening the automotive industry. EPA staff emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by the Environmental Defense Fund in 2018 show that, within days of Trump's announcement, EPA director Scott Pruitt directed EPA staff to remove much of the climate change information from the agency's website and \\"[modify] search results for 'Clean Power Plan' to feature a page touting Trump's executive order featuring a photo of the president posing with smiling coal miners, Pruitt and other members of his cabinet.\\" In May 2019, Administrator Andrew Wheeler announced plans to change the way the EPA calculates health risks of air pollution, resulting in the reporting of far fewer health-related deaths and making it easier to roll back the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan. The Trump administration has argued that the Obama administration over-estimated the health risks for various environmental regulations, to the detriment of industry. Administrator Wheeler defended the change as a way to rectify inconsistencies in the current cost-benefit analyses used by the agency. The new plan is known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule. The planned changes were hailed by industry representatives. Environmentalists are fighting the administration's power plant regulation rollbacks. In April 2020, several environmental groups and twenty-two states filed their first legal briefs in an attempt to fight the administration's attempt to loosen emission standards. Environmentalists are concerned that the new standards are so limited in the pollution controls it requires power producers to install that it could hamstring future administrations from addressing climate-altering pollution. Carbon Monitoring System The Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) is a NASA remote monitoring system used to measure carbon dioxide and methane, using instruments placed in satellites and aircraft. The information provided by the CMS can be used to verify the national emission cuts agreed to in the Paris climate accords. CMS has also supported other research projects including providing information that has helped countries assess their carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. In April 2018, President Trump ended funding for the CMS. 2016 methane rule In September 2018, the Trump administration submitted plans to roll back Obama-era legislation designed to reduce oil and gas industry leaks of methane gas. The proposed new rule would put an additional 380,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere from 2019 to 2025, an amount that is roughly equivalent to more than 30 million tons of carbon dioxide. The EPA noted that while increased pollution as a result of the proposal “may also degrade air quality and adversely affect health and welfare,” their plan will save $75 million in regulatory costs annually. Governor Jerry Brown of California called the administration's proposal \\"perhaps the most obvious and dangerous and irresponsible action by Mr. Trump – and that’s saying quite a lot.\\"  2018 National Climate Assessment  President Trump states \\"I've seen it, I've read some of it and it's fine.\\" and \\"I don't believe it.\\" In November 2018, the government released its Fourth National Climate Assessment, largely compiled during the Obama Administration. The report, issued every four years, is written by 13 federal agencies and more than 300 leading climate scientists. The report warns of the potential catastrophic impacts of climate change including changes to the availability of food and water, increasing extreme weather and decreasing air quality, and the spread of new diseases by insects and pests. When questioned about the report President Trump replied, “I’ve seen it. I’ve read some of it. It’s fine [but] I don’t believe it.” Following its release the Trump Administration criticized the report saying it was not factually based. Acting EPA head Andrew Wheeler said he “wouldn’t be surprised if the Obama administration directed authors to the worst-case scenario.\\" Wheeler's statement was followed by an EPA press release which said that Wheeler “was right” adding, “In fact, the Obama administration did just that.” The EPA used a report done by the Daily Caller, a conservative website founded by Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson, as proof of their claims. FactCheck.Org found the Caller's claims to be \\"false, exaggerated or unsubstantiated.\\" In October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report that had been commissioned by policymakers at the Paris climate talks in 2016. The report, authored by the world's leading climate scientists, warned there are only 12 years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which \\"even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.\\" G7 meetings Trump attended the 44th G7 summit held in Canada in 2018 and the 45th G7 summit held in France in 2019. G7 Summits are conferences held between industrialized nations to discuss world affairs. Trump arrived late for the 2018 meeting, missing the full discussions on gender equality. He left early to attend a meeting with Kim Jong Un, choosing to not take part in the discussions about climate change and cleaning up the oceans which were being held on the third day of the summit meetings. On the third day of the 2019 G7 talks world leaders discussed climate change, biodiversity, and warming oceans. A spokesperson said Trump had to skip the discussion due to a scheduled meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, although they were both attending the climate meeting. Later in the day when reporters asked him about the climate session he replied, \\"We’re having it in a little while.” although the meeting had already taken place. At a press conference Trump said he was \\"an environmentalist\\" adding, \\"I think I know more about the environment than most people.\\" The 46th G7 summit is scheduled to be held in the U.S. in 2020. In October 2019, Trump's chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced that the event would be held at the Trump National Doral Miami, a golf resort in Florida which is owned by Trump. Mulvaney told reporters \\"Climate change will not be on the agenda.\\" The state of Florida is the state most vulnerable to the effects of global warming such as rising ocean levels and more severe storms. Lawsuits During its first few months, the Trump administration rescinded rules limiting mercury and air toxins from power plants, limiting water pollution from coal plants, banning the pesticide chlorpyrifos, and banning methane emissions from landfills, among other rules, which has resulted in lawsuits from various environmental groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Some lawsuits against the Trump administration's regulation rollbacks have been successful, such as a lawsuit from the Environmental Defense Fund and other environmental groups against the administration's decision to suspend a rule which limited methane emissions from oil and gas wells, a decision which was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Following legal action, the administration has also reversed its decision to do away with an Obama-era plan requiring dentists to prevent about five tons of mercury, used in their practice, from getting into the nation's waterways. By February 2018, New York's attorney general Eric Schneiderman had filed over 50 lawsuits opposing the Trump administration's environmental revisions, saying New York had \\"beaten back\\" several of the administration's deregulation attempts, \\"from energy efficiency rollbacks to smog.\\" Commentary Speaking in April 2020 during the coronavirus emergency, Noam Chomsky noted that when Trump and his administration released their budget for the coming year they had defunded the CDC and other government institutions responsible for health. However, the Administration had \\"increased funding for some things, like fossil fuel production [...] I mean, it’s as if the country is simply — maybe not 'as if' — the country is simply run by sociopaths.\\" While calling the pandemic \\"bad and serious\\" Chomsky said the U.S. will recover, though at serious cost. However, \\"We’re not going to recover from the melting of the polar ice sheets, which is leading to a feedback effect, well known, that increases — as they melt, there’s less reflective surface, more absorption in the dark seas. The warming that’s melting increases. That’s just one of the factors that’s leading to destruction, unless we do something about it.\\" See also * Carbon bubble * List of lawsuits involving Donald Trump * March for Science * People's Climate March (2017) * Trump administration political interference with science agencies * Space-based measurements of carbon dioxide, * Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite, and TanSat References 2017 in the environment Environmental policy in the United States Policies of Donald Trump Presidency of Donald Trump Climate change denial Climate change controversies Trump administration controversies ","title":"Environmental policy of the Donald Trump administration"},{"id":"52935808","text":"Atlantida: mensário artístico, literário e social para Portugal e Brasil (Portuguese for \\"Atlantis\\") was a review published in Portugal and Brazil from 1915 to 1920.

Precisely, an effective Cartier divisor in a scheme X over a ring R is a closed subscheme D of X that (1) is flat over R and (2) the ideal sheaf I(D) of D is locally free of rank one (i.e., invertible sheaf). Equivalently, a closed subscheme D of X is an effective Cartier divisor if there is an open affine cover U_i = \\\\operatorname{Spec} A_i of X and nonzerodivisors f_i \\\\in A_i such that the intersection D \\\\cap U_i is given by the equation f_i = 0 (called local equations) and A / f_i A is flat over R and such that they are compatible.  An effective Cartier divisor as the zero-locus of a section of a line bundle  Let L be a line bundle on X and s a section of it such that s: \\\\mathcal{O}_X \\\\hookrightarrow L (in other words, s is a \\\\mathcal{O}_X(U)-regular element for any open subset U.) Choose some open cover \\\\\\\\{ U_i \\\\\\\\} of X such that L_{U_i} \\\\simeq \\\\mathcal{O}_X_{U_i}. For each i, through the isomorphisms, the restriction s_{U_i} corresponds to a nonzerodivisor f_i of \\\\mathcal{O}_X(U_i). Now, define the closed subscheme \\\\\\\\{ s = 0 \\\\\\\\} of X (called the zero-locus of the section s) by :\\\\\\\\{ s = 0 \\\\\\\\} \\\\cap U_i = \\\\\\\\{ f_i = 0 \\\\\\\\}, where the right-hand side means the closed subscheme of U_i given by the ideal sheaf generated by f_i. This is well-defined (i.e., they agree on the overlaps) since f_i/f_j_{U_i \\\\cap U_j} is a unit element. For the same reason, the closed subscheme \\\\\\\\{ s = 0 \\\\\\\\} is independent of the choice of local trivializations. Equivalently, the zero locus of s can be constructed as a fiber of a morphism; namely, viewing L as the total space of it, the section s is a X-morphism of L: a morphism s: X \\\\to L such that s followed by L \\\\to X is the identity. Then \\\\\\\\{ s = 0 \\\\\\\\} may be constructed as the fiber product of s and the zero- section embedding s_0: X \\\\to L. Finally, when \\\\\\\\{ s = 0 \\\\\\\\} is flat over the base scheme S, it is an effective Cartier divisor on X over S. Furthermore, this construction exhausts all effective Cartier divisors on X as follows. Let D be an effective Cartier divisor and I(D) denote the ideal sheaf of D. Because of locally-freeness, taking I(D)^{-1} \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathcal{O}_X} - of 0 \\\\to I(D) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_X \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_D \\\\to 0 gives the exact sequence :0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_X \\\\to I(D)^{-1} \\\\to I(D)^{-1} \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{O}_D \\\\to 0 In particular, 1 in \\\\Gamma(X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X) can be identified with a section in \\\\Gamma(X, I(D)^{-1}), which we denote by s_D. Now we can repeat the early argument with L = I(D)^{-1}. Since D is an effective Cartier divisor, D is locally of the form \\\\\\\\{ f = 0 \\\\\\\\} on U = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(A) for some nonzerodivisor f in A. The trivialization L_U = Af^{-1} \\\\overset{\\\\sim}\\\\to A is given by multiplication by f; in particular, 1 corresponds to f. Hence, the zero-locus of s_D is D.  Properties  *If D and D' are effective Cartier divisors, then the sum D + D' is the effective Cartier divisor defined locally as fg = 0 if f, g give local equations for D and D' . *If D is an effective Cartier divisor and R \\\\to R' is a ring homomorphism, then D \\\\times_R R' is an effective Cartier divisor in X \\\\times_R R'. *If D is an effective Cartier divisor and f: X' \\\\to X a flat morphism over R, then D' = D \\\\times_X X' is an effective Cartier divisor in X' with the ideal sheaf I(D') = f^* (I(D)).  Examples   Hyperplane bundle   Effective Cartier divisors on a relative curve  From now on suppose X is a smooth curve (still over R). Let D be an effective Cartier divisor in X and assume it is proper over R (which is immediate if X is proper.) Then \\\\Gamma(D, \\\\mathcal{O}_D) is a locally free R-module of finite rank. This rank is called the degree of D and is denoted by \\\\deg D. It is a locally constant function on \\\\operatorname{Spec} R. If D and D' are proper effective Cartier divisors, then D + D' is proper over R and \\\\deg(D + D') = \\\\deg(D) + \\\\deg(D'). Let f: X' \\\\to X be a finite flat morphism. Then \\\\deg(f^* D) = \\\\deg(f) \\\\deg(D). On the other hand, a base change does not change degree: \\\\deg(D \\\\times_R R') = \\\\deg(D). A closed subscheme D of X is finite, flat and of finite presentation if and only if it is an effective Cartier divisor that is proper over R.  Weil divisors associated to effective Cartier divisors  Given an effective Cartier divisor D, there are two equivalent ways to associate Weil divisor [D] to it.

The Keshcarrigan Bowl is an Iron Age bronze bowl discovered to the north of Keshcarrigan, county Leitrim, Ireland, in the 19th century. The bowl was found in the waterway between Lough Scur and Lough Marrave (\\"lake of death\\"). It was perhaps a ceremonial drinking cup. The bowl would have been a prestigious item in 1st century Ireland, the bird-shaped handle outstandingly designed and skillfully executed. The Keshcarrigan Bowl is in the archaeology branch of the National Museum of Ireland. The Keshcarrigan bowl is considered one of the finest classic cast bronze cups, or drinking vessel. Made of bright-yellow metal, it was discovered during the building of the \\"Ulster Canal\\". The bowl is a fine golden bronze only wide and in thickness, being cast or beaten into shape before being finished and polished by being spun on a lathe. The neck was finished off against an internal mould. The principal decorative feature of the bowl is its cast bronze zoomorphic handle, following the graceful shape of a bird-beast head of a somewhat nondescript appearance influenced by the flamboyant ornamentation of its time, soldered to the body of the vessel at the base and loosely connected to the vessel neck. The ridge at the front of the bird-head, the 'shield' below, and impression of a beak turning-backward, are all characteristic of the male-Shelduck. In 2018 it was shown on an Irish postage stamp, after featuring in A History of Ireland in 100 Objects.Page in A History of Ireland in 100 Objects Style FAKL-8A09C2, Medieval Mount bearing resemblance to 'Keshcarrigan bowl' mount. The brilliantly modeled ducks-head handle on the Keshcarrigan bowl is an early masterpiece of the style, comparable to the best British work of the period such as the bird- finials on the Torrs Chamfrein horns, the stylistic identity of both heads representing ducks, and both having empty slots for studs in the eyes. The Torrs style originated in Britain in the middle or second half of the third century BC. The Keshcarrigan cup is on stylistic grounds likely to be contemporary with the Torrs pieces, with the “crimped” pattern on the rim of the Keshcarrigan bowl perhaps comparable with similar techniques used on the circular Wandsworth boss and the terminal circular insignias on the Witham Shield. The bowl seems to have close affinities to pottery bowls of identical profile from Brittany, which have a similar “crimped” pattern on their inner rims. Being lathe-spun the age of the bowl suggests a comparatively late date at variance with the stylistic evidence. The bowl is of importance in showing the Torrs style is recorded in both Britain and Ireland. The cup resembles another found at Fore, County Westmeath, which is slightly earlier and imported from Britain, as this may also be.Wallace and O'Floinn, 4:7 (Fore), 4:8 (Keshcarrigan) Purpose The bowl was intended for drinking purposes, for eating food out of, as a container, and ceremonial purposes. Metal handled cups are a feature of late La Tène culture, and their production might have been stimulated by the re-appearance of wine-services imported from the Classical world. Origin Some sources suggest the bowl was imported across the Irish Sea because the practice of producing bronze bowls using a spinning technique was done in the Belgae workshops of south-east England, and Roman continental workshops, rather than Ireland. However the evidence for this conclusion is conjecture, and the Keshcarrigan bowl was just as likely made in Ireland. A reasonably close parallel to the Keshcarrigan cup is a handled vessel of willow, presumably Irish origin, in the National Museum of Ireland, and another bronze handle from a similar profile cup was discovered at County Galway. Conversely, though a similar handle was recently found in the Somerset hoard, no other vessel of this style was found in southern Britain, so the practice of making bowls with ornamental bird handles must have become established in Ireland sometime in the early 1st century AD. Belgae refugees O'Toole suggested the Keshcarrigan Bowl represents evidence for the movement of people into Ireland following upheavals in Celtic Europe in the century before and after the birth of Christ. Gallic Belgic tribes crossed into Britain as refugees from the Romans and displacing native people some of whom came to Ireland.

Regulatory processes are established at the federal and state level due to the immense economic, socio-political and environmental impact of fossil fuel extraction and production. Over 80% of the United States' energy comes from fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil. The Bush administration was marked by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which provided a monetary incentive for renewable energy adoption and addressed the issue of climate change. The Obama administration was made up of advocates for renewable energy and natural gas, while Donald Trump built his campaign on promises to revive the coal industry. Oil, gas, and coal companies have been at odds with policy makers who have supported a wider implementation of renewable energy, with the former often spending millions of dollars to lobby against cleaner energy. The Washington Post reported on February 22, 2017 Scott Pruitt's potential special interests with the fossil fuel industry as he began his term as the appointed head of the EPA under the Trump administration. Fossil fuel emission disproportionately affects working class, poor and minority populations. The people most adversely affected also have the least political influence and least access to health care.  Phase out regulations  The term \\"phasing out\\" describes the gradual decrease in dependence on using fossil fuels as a major source of energy in the United States. Since the Obama administration, there has been a nationwide push to move from fossil fuels to green alternatives. A gradual move towards renewable energy, such as wind and solar, has led to a decline in the use of fossil fuels because of their contribution to greenhouse gases. Reasons for this shift include lower costs for natural gas, Cap-and-trade policies, and a carbon tax in some areas of the country. Resistance against phase out regulations For much of the United States' history, fossil fuels have been a major energy source. While phasing out these fossil fuels will benefit the world climate in the long run, little has been done to stop burning fossil fuels and emitting CO2 into the atmosphere. If the United States effectively phases out fossil fuels, tons of energy in the form of oil, coal, and natural gas will be left untouched under the surface of the ground. Although this energy source is limited, companies and workers continue to drill into the Earth to extract it all. Phasing out during the Obama administration In August 2015, President Obama and his administration passed legislation to cut emissions from coal power plants. The goal of this legislation is to become more dependent on clean energy such as wind and solar power. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set a benchmark of reducing CO2 emissions by 32% by 2030 from their 2005 levels. This plan and end goal became known as the Clean Power Plan. Company and worker response The main issue in dealing with the fossil fuel phase-out has been job loss. Companies in the fossil fuel industry have begun to experience the effects of the phasing-out of fossil fuels like coal. For example, Consol Energy, originally a coal-producing company, has begun the transition to becoming a natural gas producer. Not only does this shift affect its current role in the coal industry but it also has led to employment cuts. With the shuttering of coal plants, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association estimates that over one million jobs will be lost. With the coal industry aging, many coal mines are deteriorating and becoming costly to keep running. As a result, coal plants are no longer a reliable, go-to energy source for the United States. Controversies (within the Trump administration) Many of Donald Trump's nominees for positions within his cabinet dispute proven facts about climate change. They include Scott Pruitt for the head of the EPA who as an Oklahoma attorney general repeatedly sued the EPA over its rules. Since becoming the head of the EPA, Pruitt has been running on an agenda solely concerned to bring jobs to the coal mining industry despite many of these mines having violated legislation protecting the environment (e.g. the Clean Water Act). Following the United Nations Climate Treaty, signed by 200 nations in 2015, Trump's actions are a distinct step backwards from phasing out fossil fuels. Most notably, on March 28, 2017, Trump signed the Energy Independence Executive Order designed to get rid of the Clean Power Plan initiated by President Obama. As a result, any previous action and steps taken to stop climate change will not be sustained. Trump has also promised to bring back the coal industry despite most greenhouse gases coming from coal-based power plants.  Oil regulations  The majority of oil and gas regulations in the United States determine at what points in the processing procedure different organizations can claim ownership of the material. Regulations tend to state that whoever owns land has ownership of resources there. States and eventually the federal government then have authority over the areas over which they have jurisdiction. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration within the U.S. Department of Labor is in charge of regulating oil extraction. The oil industry in the United States is run by a series of privately owned companies.  Concerns and related regulations  = Oil spills = The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration within the United States Department of Commerce developed a graphic of the largest oil spills impacting U.S. waters up since 1969. Since 2000, the largest spill has been the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. With the exception of Kalamazoo River (2010), all other major spills have occurred around the Gulf of Mexico. Map of the largest oil spills in U.S. waters since 1969 In May 2010, the United States Department of the Interior called for an end to drilling in the area of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Despite pushback from oil companies and states, the Supreme Court ruled to keep the moratorium in place until October 2010. BP agreed to financial compensation for the damage they caused, including payouts to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust. Regulations drafted after the accident required oil companies to update their safety equipment, including blowout preventers. This measure was criticized as too costly to integrate and thus harmful to industry and job growth, so it has been weakly enforced. Despite actions taken, the region has been slow to recover. During the moratorium, there was a decrease in employment in the oil industry along the Florida Coast and a net increase in employment in Louisiana, which also received more concern from the oil industry. Coastal areas were impacted economically more than inland areas. The Louisiana fishing industry was shown to still be damaged by the spill years after it had occurred. Oyster numbers in particular have dropped significantly in the region. Other at risk species used as sustenance include speckled trout, crabs, and mullet. Due to proximity to the spill site, Louisiana bore the brunt of clean up efforts. BP decided on the oil dissolving chemical Corexit which was shown by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to be neither the most or least toxic option. Criticisms of the use of the chemical included health impacts on humans, such as headaches, vomiting, and reproductive problems. The Kalamazoo River oil spill, the first major dilbit spill, occurred in June 2010 in Calhoun County, Michigan, and led to \\"the largest on-land spill in American history\\" at the time. The pipeline company Enbridge promised to improve safety measures and agreed to pay $177 million to resolve their violations of the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act including additional fines to cover other spills and clean-up costs after an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency. Although Enbridge purchased 148 houses plus land and mobile homes along the spill route, some residents did not return to the area. The County Director of Emergency management believed \\"the majority of people living along the river won't be impacted by the settlement.\\" The city of Battle Creek, Michigan sits in the middle of the area where damage from the spill occurred; 21.7% of its population is below the poverty line compared to 17.5% for Calhoun County and 18.3% for Kalamazoo County where the oil eventually flowed. The percentage of the population of Michigan below the poverty line is 16.7%. Under section 311(c) of the Clean Water Act, the EPA was able to order Enbridge to finish cleaning up the oil spill. Although no specific regulations for dilbit oil have been proposed, in 2013 when plans for the Keystone XL Pipeline were being developed, the EPA recommended that the State Department “include means to address the additional risks of releases that may be greater for spills of dilbit than other crudes” in response to the damages caused by the Kalamazoo River oil spill. Dilbit oil more readily evaporates from the surface of water than normal crude oil, and after this evaporation occurs the remaining product sinks faster. = Oil workers' rights = The Occupational Safety and Health Administration within the U.S. Department of Labor sets the requirements oil companies must abide by for the treatment of their employees; among them, that \\"employers provide their employees with safe and healthful workplaces\\", and that the employer must be held responsible should an employee be denied their rights. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prevents a company from not hiring someone on the basis of race, sex, religion, or national origin applies to oil rig workers. Because oil rig workers can be working outside where OSHA has jurisdiction within mainland U.S., state or maritime laws may apply instead in cases of unemployment, security checks, and safety regulations with responsibilities falling on the Transportation Security Administration, FBI, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and the U.S. Coast Guard. The United Steelworkers union also advocates for employees of the oil industry. Pointe-à-Pierre refinery and fenceline community As of 2015, there is no stringent enforcement of overtime or hazard pay. Workers have also complained about the lax attitude of refineries toward the improvement of safety measures and equipment resulting in the 2015 United Steel Workers Oil Refinery strike. An agreement was eventually reached to determine more standardized safety regulations and to improve pay and health care costs. Such safety regulations are also important for fenceline communities which are disproportionately impacted by the pollution generated by refining facilities and in which people of color tend to be the majority. There has also been a historic precedence of siting refineries in existing communities of color. A bill introduced in 2006 was passed by the House of Representatives with the intent to expedite the siting process of states by offering federal assistance in the form of \\"expertise in fields relevant to consideration of federal refinery authorizations\\". = Pipelines = Pipelines are an economical way to transport large volumes of petroleum products. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration within the U.S. Department of Transportation is responsible for enforcing pipeline transport regulations at the federal level. Regulations cover the hazardous materials transported as well as the safety of the pipeline itself. A series of pipeline safety acts have been passed over the years including the Pipeline Safety Improvement act of 2002; The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011; and the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2016. Individual states have varying regulations for the transport of oil into and out of state boundaries, which limits where pipelines can be built. Protest against Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines As more pipelines are built, oil companies profits and investments into these companies continue to increase. A decrease in material costs outweighs the net increase in cost of construction. The increase in construction costs results largely from increased labor and permitting costs. Supporters of pipeline transport cite the potential for job creation, with the greatest being in construction. Estimates for job growth vary, and some are found to be exaggerated. Little evidence has also been found to support the idea that oil prices will either stabilize or decrease once pipelines are constructed. Critics of pipeline transport of oil cite environmental and land rights issues. Protests over the Keystone XL Pipeline beginning in 2011 and Dakota Access Pipeline have expressed these same concerns. Native peoples have been active protesters. The Standing Rock Sioux of South Dakota opposed the construction plans of the Dakota Access Pipeline because it ran through a symbolically significant area, and expressed concern that it could compromise their source of drinking water. Since pipelines have been built, multiple pipeline accidents have occurred, resulting in oil spills and the contamination of the surrounding environment. The tribe was also not involved in planning the route for the pipeline. These protests also reflect the ongoing struggle for Native American recognition in the United States. In November 2015 President Barack Obama called to stop construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. In December 2016 the Army Corps of Engineers prevented further construction on the pipeline near the Standing Rock Reservation. On January 24, 2017 President Donald Trump signed an executive order permitting the completion of both the Keystone XL Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline. On March 24, 2017 the permit was granted.  Coal regulations  Along with other fossil fuels, coal is a major energy resource for the U.S. Most of the energy supplied by coal production is consumed by the electric power sector. Due to competition with renewable energy and natural gas, coal production has been declining since 2008. Currently the U.S. occupies five major basins or regions where coal is produced. The U.S. Energy Information Administration released coal production data of 2016 in January, reporting a 17% decrease from 2015 levels. As coal is projected to remain a key energy resource, regulations concerning environmental pollution increase.  Concerns and related regulations  = Pollution from stationary sources = The Environmental Protection Administration monitors and controls the emissions from coal-fired power plants to ensure public health and air quality. Coal production and consumption generates various environmental impacts such as the release of greenhouse gases. There are around 1,100 major electric power plants, which are subject to New Source Review (NSR) and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD). Emissions from these plants have the largest contributions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. Facilities in the electric sector are restricted to emission standards defined by the Clean Air Act (United States). A coal fired power plant While monitoring and controlling environmental releases of plants has been difficult, the EPA has been enforcing their policies regarding air quality over the last decade under President Barack Obama. While the Clean Air Act postulates regulations and rules limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases, other laws are concerned with standards of power plants and initiatives to enforce these laws have been formed. The impacts of mining are diverse and have possible negative effects for humans and the biosphere. Among these are acid mine drainage, subsidence and mine workers' health risks, to prevent which there are regulations regarding mining practices like strip mining. Even though regulations seek to address environmental impacts, they often do not provide remedy for the social and health disparities created by exposure to emissions from electric power plants. Methods of extraction have developed over the last decade to make coal extraction more efficient. With more advanced technologies, the environmental burdens become larger with increased emissions of particulate matter and acid rain deposition linked to coal mining. = Controversies = With the administration of President Donald Trump, environmental regulations concerning coal mining are set to be eased. An executive order was proposed in February 2017 to reverse the Stream Protection Rule that aims at protecting nearby waters from surface mining debris. Trump's support for this move comes from his interest in the fossil fuel industry and from an incentive to reactivate the coal industry in the US, which has been on a consistent decline from competition of renewables and natural gas. The repeal of President Obama's Stream Protection Rule could possibly endanger species by polluting ecosystems and thereby harming biodiversity. Ecological effects of coal mining include contamination of water, destruction of habitats, leaching, soil erosion and subsidence. A coal miner Further, on March 28, 2017, Trump signed an executive order to rewrite President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan. Much of this incentive is driven by expanding the workforce in the coal industry, however it is still undetermined how soon this will take effect. With continued trends in repealing past rules and regulations regarding Climate change under the Trump administration, the commitment to the Paris climate agreement held at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference is under question. Uncertainty about the development of this debate sparks much global controversy and unclarity in the reactions and future prognoses of climate and environmental politics. While international concerns are expressed, economists do not think that the proposed repeals will have much effect. Demand for coal on the national market has been declining and is still low, so that changes to the pollution standards and greenhouse gas emissions do not actually change the market drastically.  Natural gas regulations   Increased use in the U.S.  Natural gas was first discovered in the United States in 1626, when the French explorers found Native Americans setting gas on fire that leaked into Lake Erie.American Public Gas Association. \\"A Brief History of Natural Gas.\\" American Public Gas Association, n.d. Retrieved 12 Apr. 2017. In 1816, the U.S. first lighted the streets of Baltimore, Maryland. Then in 1821, the first successful natural gas well was dug in Fredonia, New York, which allowed for the American natural gas distribution company to be built there in 1858. And then in 1836, the first city-owned natural gas distribution company was created in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While during the 1800s, natural gas was used mainly for lighting streets and homes, the creation of pipelines in the 1900s allowed for extensive use of it in home appliances, manufacturing plants, and boilers. Due to an increased population, increased per capita consumption, and increased standard of living, there has been drastically more energy consumption internationally.Chen, Nai Y. \\"Energy in the 21st Century.\\" Chemical Innovation 31.1 (2001): 14-20. American Chemical Society. Web. From the 2000s forward, there was a sharp increase in the production, use, trade, and advocacy of natural gas especially in the United States for several reasons. As of now, natural gas is the most domestically abundant fossil fuel in this country, and therefore considered the most affordable option in this country. It is so abundant because horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have helped access natural gas from previously unavailable gas deposits. It is also considered the world's cleanest fossil fuel because it generates the least air pollution and releases the least carbon dioxide per unit of energy than oil or coal.Smil, Vaclav. Natural Gas: Fuel for the 21st Century. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2015. It is also seen as a “bridge fuel” between carbon-intensive coal and oil to a renewable energy future.Hughes, David. \\"Will Natural Gas Fuel America in the 21st Century?\\" Post Carbon Institute, 29 May 2011.

Retrieved 12 Apr. 2017. The industry has also extensively publicized itself. They have done this by first drilling in the sites that would have the best results so that later they could apply this to more critical sites. The energy sector, needing to come up with new sources of energy for the future, embraced natural gas unquestioningly. Also environmental organizations that were trying to get the government to cut carbon emissions but didn't want to call for complete energy cutbacks, settled for advocating natural gas use as a \\"bridge fuel\\" into a renewable future. Global demand for energy is supposed to increase by 50% in 20 years, and specifically that for natural gas is supposed to increase by 70% in 20 years.Gass, John D. \\"Delivering the Promise of Natural Gas in the 21st Century.\\" Chevron Global Gas.

American Gas Association, n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2017. https://www.aga.org/supply>.  Natural gas industry in the U.S.  In the 90's the U.S. initially started using more natural gas because new technology was able to lower its generation costs and pipeline expansion was able to increase its availability.Gorman, Sean. \\"Surovell Says Decline in Coal Started under George W. Bush.\\" Politifact Virginia. Politifact, 23 Feb. 2015. Retrieved 12 Apr. 2017. Then under the Presidency of George W. Bush (2000-2008), a combination of factors led to a growth in the natural gas industry. Bush passed the Energy Policy Act in 2005, that exempted chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Water Drinking Act, which means more places were being fracked. Starting around the same time hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling became more widely used since they made shale energy reserves more accessible. The industry pushed to drill more natural gas in more places, because they believed that they had the technology, expertise, and need as well as the fact that tremendous energy and profit could be made from more sites. However, until this day 94% of the country's offshore acreage has not been made available to energy development, despite requests from the natural gas industry. This has all allowed for the United States to become the world's leading oil and natural gas producer since 2009, when it surpassed Russia. This has caused more economic growth and energy security because less imported oil means less dependence, and more exported natural gas means more profit and ties to more countries.Green, Mark. \\"America's 21st Century Energy Story.\\" EnergyTomorrow.org. 4 Feb. 2017. Web. 05 Apr. 2017. During Barack Obama's Presidency (2008-2016) he attempted to focus on domestic energy production and use. At first he had called natural gas the \\"cornerstone\\" in his administration's “Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future”. It wasn't until severe public outlash and large demonstrations from mainstream media and environmental groups that Obama released a Climate Action Plan in 2013.Shogren, Elizabeth. \\"Obama's Legacy: Assessing the Impact of Climate Policies on the American West.\\" Newsweek, 13 Jan. 2017. Retrieved 13 Apr. 2017. This plan attempted to cut greenhouse gas emissions, cut carbon emissions, and cut methane emissions from oil and gas production. He also released a National Climate Change Assessment, took part in the Paris Climate Agreement, and allowed for higher EPA regulations that regulated fossil fuels, including natural gas production. During this time period natural gas production decreased on federal lands; however, it spiked on private lands, which meant it was not losing momentum, unlike coal, any time soon. The election of Donald Trump (2017) has coincided with the country's attempt at globalization with increasing pipeline exports and LNG shipments.\\"Trump Inauguration: US Power, Natural Gas Poised for Change under Trump Administration.\\" Platts. Platts, 20 Jan. 2017. 13 Apr. 2017. http://www.platts.com/latest-news/electric-power/washington/trump- inauguration-us-power-natural-gas-poised-21665954>.

Retrieved 13 Apr. 2017. In respect to natural gas, this plan will attempt to “take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own.” However, even though Trump plans on opening some of these lands closed to drilling, analysts believe that this would not only be difficult with all the regulation but also would not increase revenue as much Trump believes it would. Trump also plans on eliminating Obama's Climate Action Plan and all its regulations.  Natural gas controversies  = Environmental controversies = There have been several controversies in the natural gas industry. As natural gas use and production as well as fracking have increased, the environmental and human health risks associated with it have become more apparent, which has made people doubt the cleanliness of the process. Natural gas facility Drilling has increased two out of six “criteria” pollutants (particulate matter and ozone) that the EPA regulates due to their negative impacts. People who come in contact with these air pollutants can have severe health problems such as respiratory issues, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. A study has found that people within half a mile from a gas well site were more likely to have health problems from air pollution than people living farther.\\"Environmental Impacts of Natural Gas.\\" Ucsusa.org. Union of Concerned Scientists, 2013. Web. 05 Apr. 2017. Drilling also risks contaminating surface water and groundwater, which harms people drinking from those water sources. This contamination happens when hazardous chemicals from the drilling process leak into the water, when processing and refining the gas leave residue, and when disposal of waste water nearby pollutes the land. These chemicals can be radioactive materials, methane, other gases, and carcinogenic chemicals. However, the industry has countered than this contamination is the result of bad practice and not of a bad industry. Drilling harms ecosystems because a drilling site is accompanied by construction, land disturbance, and land clearing. This causes erosion of not only dirt but also of other harmful pollutants. And drilling also fragments the wildlife's habitat and migration needs. The transportation of natural gas in pipes also results in methane leakage. Methane is 34 times stronger than CO2 at trapping heat over a 100-year period. The disposal of wastewater at fracking sites by injecting it at high pressure into injection wells has caused small earth tremors. At least half of the 4.5 magnitude earthquakes in the United States in the last 10 years have happened in places where there has been injection. Fracking also uses huge amounts of water that needs to be transported, which inflicts not only a high cost to the industry but also a high toll on the environment. Anti-fracking protest = Social controversies = Anti-fracking campaigners, including Greenpeace, have said that fracking is the Department of Energy's attempt to distract from investment in renewable energy.Jones, Anna. \\"UK Government Faces Criticism as It Opens Country up to Fracking.\\" The Tree - Content for Climate & Energy Communicators. 17 Dec. 2013.

St Mary's Chapel was added to the complex in the early 1900s, and a two-storey red-brick accommodation wing. The chapel was adorned by 12 stained glass windows by Harry Clarke.Chapel of the Novitiate of the Oblate Fathers of St. Mary Immaculate -Belcamp Home In 1972 the historic Belcamp Hall was placed on the protected structures list. Alumni The actor Brendan Gleeson worked as an English and Irish teacher in Belcamp. The golfer Philip Walton was a pupil in the school, as was the theologian and writer Thomas Groome. Another former student at Belcamp was Fr Stewart Joseph Phelan OMI, who served as Navy chaplain in the Great War on HMS Black Prince; he was lost at sea at the Battle of Jutland in 1916.Centenary of the Battle of Jutland Sport The school produced some successful Gaelic football sides, winning the GAA Secondary Schools, Leinster Colleges Senior Football Championship in 1921, 1965, 1967 and 1968, and twice runners-up in the All-Ireland Schools final (for the Hogan Cup). Father Tom Scully, who taught mathematics, trained Belcamp's team to the three 1960s Leinster Schools' Football Championships. After the school The house was much damaged by vandals and fire following the closure of the school in 2004, when it was sold to property developer Gerry Gannon.Gannon embarks on plan for historic dublin site by John Mulligan, Irish Independent, 5 January 2016. Eventually the property fell under the control of NAMA. After 2011, the developer and the local authority did work to secure the premises more actively, but much loss had already occurred. Planning permission issued mid-2017 for the conversion of the main house into apartments, with a restaurant and childcare facility in one wing, and for 165 homes on the surrounding 15 hectares. Further housing proposals, including for five blocks of apartments, were to follow. An Taisce was supportive of the plans, while the Irish Georgian Society and some local residents had concerns about the historic building and public rights of way on parts of the land. As of summer 2018, the lands are now in development. Gannon Homes at one time planned up to 2,000 residential units, but only a few hundred have yet been considered for planning permission. Elements Belcamp Hall The house was based on a similar model to the White House in Washington, and it included an \\"oval office.\\" It is a three-storey over basement, seven-bay structure. The River and the Ponds The Turnapin Stream, one of the two main branches of the Mayne River, and often referred to by the river's name, runs through the property south of the house and other buildings, and is dammed to form two ponds, simply called the Upper and Lower Pond, and with weirs to regulate the water flow. The Walled Garden Northwest of and behind the Hall is a walled garden. Now in poor repair, it once supplied the house with fruit and vegetables. The Washington Monument A castellate monument was erected to George Washington, possibly the first such in the world. The woods and grounds The estate also features woodland and rolling grounds, and the at-times steep-sided valley of the Turnapin or Mayne.

The Greek Revival white square tower with red accents is attached to the fog alarm building, and a lighthouse keeper's residence is located on the shore to the north. The site was considered for a lighthouse as early as 1855 by a United States lighthouse inspector, but its shoal was only marked by buoys until 1912, when the Buffalo Lightship was installed nearby. The lightship sank as a result of the Great Lakes Storm of 1913, and four years later the Canadian government commissioned the construction of the tower citing increased traffic at the eastern end of Lake Erie. Point Abino Lighthouse Point Abino Lighthouse Lens Background Point Abino had been identified as early as 1855 as a desirable location for a lighthouse. In a letter dated 29 September 1855, United States lighthouse inspector engineer J.C. Woodruff stated that a lighthouse at Point Abino equipped with a foghorn would have great utility, and would \\"save annually many lives and a large amount of property\\", particularly because most commercial shipping in Lake Erie was along the northern shore in Canada. It was one of three Canadian sites identified by Woodruff, the others being Long Point, where the Government of Canada already operated a lighthouse, and Point Pelir, where it had begun construction of a lighthouse at the time of the report. Before 1912, the shoal surrounding the point had been marked by buoys. The Buffalo Lightship, a lightship built in 1912, was installed at the site, but the violent Great Lakes Storm of 1913 sank the vessel and killed all its crew in November 1913. In its early history, the peninsula had been inhabited by Claude Aveneau, a Jesuit missionary who built a log cabin atop one of the dunes. By the late 19th century, it was the site of a quarry, lime kiln, sawmill, shortline railroad, and a few boarding houses. At this time, it had become known as \\"Point Abino\\", a corruption of the missionary's name. In 1892, Buffalo real estate developer Isaac Holloway purchased the point, subdivided it into fifty lots, and sold them to Buffalo businessmen. The peninsula had become an enclave for wealthy industrialists, particularly those from New York and Ohio, attracted to its forests to build summer houses. The federal Department of Marine and Fisheries commissioned William P. Anderson to design a lighthouse, which it built starting in 1917. The Point Abino Light Tower was a \\"response to increased traffic at the east end of Lake Erie\\". In the 15 September 1917 edition of the Canada Gazette, a notice was included that the lighthouse was under construction and would open when completed in early October. The wealthy summer house owners had formed the Point Abino Association, which negotiated with the Department of Marine and Fisheries to sign an agreement restricting access to the lighthouse from the water. As a result, the lighthouse was built on a rocky shelf at the end of the point, and the lighthouse keepers could only access the lighthouse by \\"wading through the shallows\\". Even during construction, access to the private roads on the peninsula was restricted, requiring construction material to be brought to the site via the western shore. Structure The white square tower was built in the Greek Revival style from poured concrete The five-storey tower structure is tapered with red accents, surmounting one end of a single-storey, flat- roofed rectangular fog alarm building. The structure's deck connects to a concrete walkway leading to an onshore residence for the lighthouse keeper, which was built in 1921. The 1917 specifications announced in the Canada Gazette were for the reinforced concrete lighthouse to be located \\"south from the wooded shore\\", sitting atop a reinforced concrete foundation high, reaching a peak of above the lake, with a luminous intensity of 60,000 cd making it visible from on \\"all points of approach by water\\". The iron lantern was painted red. The dodecagonal lantern room atop the building still retains its Fresnel lens, a third-order lens that was illuminated with liquefied petroleum gas in an incandescent mantle. Its light characteristic is \\"Fl(3) W 12s 27m 15M\\", indicating that the white light would flash three times. A two- second eclipse occurred between the first two flashes, and an eight-second eclipse followed the third one. The fog alarm was a diaphone which horn was mounted on the south side of the lighthouse building, above water level, and pointed 165°30' (a bearing of S 8° E). The horn was operated by compressed air, and every minute would issue three 2-second blasts separated by 3-second intervals of silence, quiesce for 48 seconds after the third blast, then repeated the pattern. The property has a gate, and is located at the south end of Abino Road. The elaborate styling was chosen to complement the summer houses that had been built on the peninsula, and was unique among Ontario lighthouses. The lighthouse keeper's residence was built in the style of an Arts and Crafts cottage on the bluffs along the shore. The lighthouse keeper's residence was made of wood and rough cast, located on the wooded shore approximately from the lighthouse. The rectangular building was painted grey, and had a red roof. In 1988, it became the last lighthouse in Ontario to be automated. It was decommissioned in 1995. National Historic Site The property and building were purchased by the town of Fort Erie from Public Works Canada on 30 April 2003. It consists of a deck, the tower, and fog alarm building. It was officially recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada on 15 July 1998, and was listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places on 22 April 2009. In 2011, a project to restore the building was undertaken. The $1.4 million cost was funded by various sources, including the federal National Historic Sites Cost-Sharing program ($425,000) and the sale of the lighthouse keeper's residence, with the remainder provided by the town of Fort Erie. The concrete base was recast and stabilized, the balcony was reconstructed, new windows and doors were installed, the entire building was painted, and the entrance was accentuated with red paint. Aesthetic modifications included the removal of all lead-based coating materials, installation of a corrosion-management system, and application of waterproof coatings. The project also involved the \\"detailed restoration of the lighthouse's lantern structure\\", replicating the lantern's original design and materials. On 8 June 2012, a commemorative plaque was unveiled by Member of Parliament Rob Nicholson, local councillors, and members of the Point Abino Lighthouse Preservation Society. The lighthouse is accessible by walking or cycling during designated hours, or can be visited via a shuttle operated by the Point Abino Lighthouse Preservation Society, a group of volunteers working to restore the building. The town pays the Point Abino Association $4,000 annually to use the private road to operate the tours. Access to the lighthouse is restricted to two tours a month with a maximum of 25 persons each tour. The tour season is four months, limiting access to a maximum of four hundred persons.

His simulations, commonly understood as \\"virtual ecosystems\\" are less about the wonders of new technologies than about the potential for these tools to realize ways of relating to a chaotic existence. His work has been widely exhibited internationally, including MoMA PS1, Serpentine Galleries, Whitney Museum of American Art, Hirshhorn Museum, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Migros Museum, and other institutions. Early life and education Cheng was born in Los Angeles, CA, in 1984. Cheng attended Van Nuys High School. Cheng graduated from University of California, Berkeley in 2006 with a dual degree in cognitive science and art practice. Cheng worked at Industrial Light & Magic, George Lucas's visual effects company. Cheng attended Columbia University, where he earned his MFA in 2009. Cheng worked in the studio of artist Pierre Huyghe from 2010 to 2012 and also worked as co-director at Paul Chan's independent New York based publishing company, Badlands Unlimited, founded in 2010. Work Cheng popularized the use of simulation as a medium available to artistic practice, capable of composing together both man-made and algorithmically generated content that together produce emergent behavior over an infinite duration. Cheng's work highlights the capacity of simulation to express the unpredictable dynamic between order and chaos in a complex system. Cheng coined the term “live simulation” as a subset of simulation that is presented in public in real-time without regard for an optimal outcome or pre-defined fitness criteria. Since 2013, Cheng has produced a series of simulations exploring an AI-based agent’s capacity to deal with an ever- changing environment. From 2015 to 2017, Cheng developed Emissaries, a trilogy of episodic live simulations that “explore the history of cognitive evolution, past and future.” Unlike previous simulations, Emissaries introduced a narrative agent, the emissary, whose motivation to enact a story was set into conflict with the open-ended chaos of the simulation. Cheng describes the archetype of the emissary as one who \\"is caught between unravelling old realities and emerging weird one,\\" an embodied way to explore the relationship between meaning and meaninglessness. Cheng drew inspiration from the narrative nature of consciousness described by Julian Jaynes in The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. At Serpentine Galleries in 2018, Cheng premiered BOB (Bag of Beliefs), an AI-based creature whose personality, body, and life script evolve across exhibitions in what Cheng calls “art with a nervous system.” BOB premiered in the United States in 2019 at Gladstone Gallery. BOB features a unique model of AI that combines an inductive engine for the learning of rule-based beliefs from sensory experiences with a motivational framework composed of mini-personalities called \\"demons\\". Each demon competes for control of BOB's body in a \\"congress of demons\\", and each utilizes the inductive engine to achieve its motivations while minimizing surprise. Viewers were invited to send their own stream of stimuli to BOB through BOB Shrine, an iOS app. Other activities Cheng directed the music video Brats, by Liars. At Frieze London in 2013, Cheng premiered Entropy Wrangler Cloud, one of the first artworks made for virtual reality, using first generation Oculus Rift headsets. Cheng developed Bad Corgi, an iOS app commissioned by Serpentine Galleries, which has been called a \\"shadowy mindfulness app for contemplating chaos.\\"  Exhibitions  *Emissaries at Fundacion Fernando de Castro, 2020 *Uncanny Valley: Being Human in the Age of AI at de Young Museum, 2020 *Mud Muses at Moderna Museet, Stockholm, 2019 *If the Snake at Okayama Art Summit, 2019 *May You Live in Interesting Times at 58th Venice Biennale, 2019 *New Order: Art and Technology in the Twenty-First Century at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2019 *BOB at Gladstone Gallery, 2019 *BOB at Serpentine Galleries, 2018 *Emissaries at Julia Stoschek Collection, 2018 *Etre moderne: Le MoMA à Paris at Fondation Louis Vuitton, 2017 *Being There at Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, 2017 *Ian Cheng at Carnegie Museum of Art, 2017 *Emissaries at MoMA PS1, 2017 *\\"Ten Days Six Nights\\" at Tate Modern, 2017 *Forking at Perfection at Migros Museum, 2016 *Dreamlands: Immersive Cinema and Art 1905–2016 at Whitney Museum of American Art, 2016 *Take Me (I’m Yours), Jewish Museum, New York, 2016 *Liverpool Biennial 2016, Liverpool, 2016 *WELT AM DRAHT, Julia Stoschek Collection, Berlin, 2016 *Suspended Animation, curated by Gianni Jetzer, Hirshhorn Museum, Washington, 2016 *Stranger, Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, 2016 *Emissary Forks At Perfection at Pilar Corrias, London, 2015 *Emissary in the Squat of Gods, curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin, 2015 *\\"Real Humans\\", curated by Elodie Evers, Irina Raskin, Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, 2015 *Ian Cheng, curated by Filipa Ramos, Triennale Di Milano, Milan, 2014 Collections Cheng's work is collected by institutions including Museum of Modern Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Migros Museum, Zurich; Louis Vuitton Foundation, Paris; Astrup Fearnley Museum, Oslo; Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin; Julia Stoschek Collection, Dusseldorf; Yuz Museum, Shanghai.

The 10th century historical text spans a period beginning with the dawn of creation through to the Islamic age. Having been translated into Turkish and Arabic, the book remained in circulation for a thousand years, and it is among the most influential books of Islamic historical literature. While the author claims the book is a Persian translation of al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings, it is actually an independent work. The literary style deviates from that of earlier Pahlavi and Middle Persian works composed in the Sasanian Empire. The Tarikhnama is considered the starting point of an influential Persian historiographical tradition that makes use of Arabic loanwords, and is based more on Arabic (and Islamic) models than earlier Sasanian ones. Bal'ami started translating the book on 352 AH (963 CE). Various manuscripts of this book are today available in the libraries of Iran, India, Turkey and Europe, but none of them are complete and error-free. The oldest surviving manuscript seems to be from 7th century AH. The book was translated into Persian language at the order of Mansur ibn Nuh, the Samanid amir. The book provides invaluable information about the Sasanian Persia and mythical history of Iran. Generally considered merely an abridged version of Tabari's work, A. C. S. Peacock demonstrated that Balami reshaped Tabari's work considerably, and that the differences between the two works are such that the Tārīkhnāma is essentially a new work.

Radio Programs, 1924-1984: A Catalog of More Than 1800 Shows. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 54. The premiere offering, The Lion and the Mouse, was followed by productions such as The Man Without a Country, The Prisoner of Zenda, and Cyrano de Bergerac. A contemporary publication's radio listing described the material as \\"Revivals of some of the plays that thrilled Grandpa and Grandma.\\" Radio historian John Dunning wrote in On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, \\"The format was faintly reminiscent of the famous First Nighter Program, with the listener led to his seat in the Brownstone Theater, and other trappings of curtains and greasepaint adding to the atmosphere.\\" The program was actually produced in the Longacre Theater in New York City's Times Square. The theater was leased by WOR from 1944 to 1953 and was used for productions on that station and on the Mutual network. Personnel The host and narrator of Brownstone Theater was Clayton Hamilton, who had been a drama critic when some of the dramas were popular on Broadway. Jackson Beck and Gertrude Warner were the original leading man and leading lady, respectively. Les Tremayne replaced Beck in July 1945. Others heard on the program included Inge Adams, Jan Miner, Elissa Landi, Jane Cowl, Edward Rose, Anthony Hope, Neil Hamilton, Walter Hampden, Michael Fitzmaurice and Shep Menken. Sylvan Levin provided the music, and Jock MacGregor was the director. Writers for the adaptions included Peggy L. Mayer, Anzie Strickland, Florence North, Gladys Milliner, Jock MacGregor, Eleanor Abbey, and Keith Thompson.

Bob Emery, the program's producer, cited it as one of the \\"shows which were fairly good examples of small budget dramatic television fare\\" in the mid-1940s. The radio programs were filmed live via Kinescope and then were broadcast two or three weeks later on the TV station. The only changes made to accommodate TV were use of \\"a miniature stage and curtains through which to introduce and close each television presentation.\\" At least four episodes of Brownstone Theater were also televised on WRGB in Schenectady, New York.

She is unsure of what kind of wish she wants and is generally the spectator of the dark nature of WIXOSS. Despite becoming more and more aware of the terrible nature of the Selector battles, she often finds herself enjoying battles. Ruko later finds her own wish, which is to free the LRIGs from their cards and return them to their own lives. In the end of season 1, Ruko loses Tama, and her new LRIG card becomes Yuki. In Spread, she adds the condition to turn all LRIGs into humans so that even those who were originally LRIGs can also become human, which she does in the final episode. She starts looking for Tama some time afterwards. Ruko has already become a high school student alongside Yuzuki and Hitoe in conflated. She is approached by Kiyoi who asked for her help to put a stop to the new Selector Battle, but she refused out of concern for Tama's safety. Unfortunately, she is then chosen to become Selector once more. ; : : Ruko's LRIG, white in color. She has a cutesy appearance and lively personality. In battle, however, she displays a frightening bloodlust. After failing to form a contract with Ruko, she ends up becoming Ulith's LRIG. She at first forgot about Mayu, but remembers fully later in Spread. She is the 'Girl of Light', an LRIG created by Mayu, and her true name is Shiro. She later rejects taking over Iona's body, and returns to Mayu as a result, only to shortly after get locked up by Mayu. She is later freed and merges with Yuki. In the series end after Ruko's wish, Tama is shown to have become a human, sitting on a rooftop. In Lostorage Conflated series, she lives with Ruko and her family. ; : :Known for most of the series as Iona Urazoe, a fashion model at the same agency as Akira, who can sense what a Selector's wish is. She has a keen thirst for battles and takes an interest in Ruko, feeling that she is just like her. She possesses the LRIG card, Ulith. After becoming an Eternal Girl, she becomes Ruko's LRIG, while Ulith takes over her body as part of her wish is to become the LRIG of a Selector who is stronger than her. In Spread, It is later revealed that she is originally an LRIG named Kuro that created by Mayu along with Tama, and she's referred as \\"The Girl of Dark\\". Yuki also begins to bond with Ruko, and later becomes her friend, and like Tama desires to help Mayu become their friend as well. After the original Iona Urazoe manages to return to her original body, Ruko gives her the name Yuki to distinguish them. After Ruko does her wish in the last episode of Spread, although Yuki is not shown, she is assumed to also have become human, as Ruko's wish was to turn even those who were originally LRIGs into humans. ; : :Kiyoi Mizushima is the main heroine of Selector infectred WIXOSS - Peeping Analyze and Lostorage Conflated WIXOSS. She is a former LRIG from the first series Selector Infected WIXOSS under the name Pirulurk. She first reappears as a Selector again in Episode 2 as Chinatsu's first opponent, who she promptly defeats. She later reveals her past as an LRIG to Chinatsu as well the events surrounding the first Selector Battles, in addition to warning her about Kou Satomi. Feeling partially responsible for creating the new Selector Battle, she intends to put a stop to it for good. To achieve this goal, she starts gathering Selectors to help her in Conflated. Her backstory is revealed in the manga adaptation, Selector infected WIXOSS - Peeping Analyze. She was cold and anti-social due to her experience of being betrayed by her supposed friend during elementary school. For this reason, she refuse to open her heart when her classmate, Ayumi Sakaguchi, constantly tried to befriend her. When Sakaguchi got hit by a truck in attempt to save her and realizing that Sakaguchi truly wanted to become friends with her, Kiyoi became determined to save her and became a Selector with an LRIG named Remember. However, when becoming an LRIG Pirulurk, Mayu shows her the outcome of her wish: Remember, who now inhabits her body, \\"saves\\" Sakaguchi by turning off her life support and leaving her to die, ending her suffering. Since then she set her goal to take revenge on Remember. Unfortunately, as Pirulurk, she is known as LRIG who brings misfortune to her Selectors as they can never win. Kiyoi's desire for revenge faltered when she was paired with a Selector named Amika Hashimoto who not only bears resemblance with Sakaguchi but also has similar wish as hers when she was a Selector. When she reunited with Remember who was using her body, Kiyoi evolved into Level 5 and used her power to rewrote Amika's wish that resulted with Amika having her wish fulfilled when they lost against Remember. Feeling betrayed, Mayu punished Kiyoi by returning her to her real body in hope she will suffer from the weight of her sins, but this allowed Kiyoi to be reunited with Amika. Selectors ; : : One of Ruko's best friends at school, who possesses the LRIG card, Hanayo. She has feelings for her twin brother, Kazuki, and desires to use her wish to make such a relationship possible. She is straightforward and bad at containing her emotions. She fulfils the conditions of her wish and enters a ritual with Hanayo. However, Hanayo takes over Yuzuki's body to receive the benefits of her wish, whilst Yuzuki becomes Hitoe's second LRIG. She is freed after Ruko has her wish granted in the last episode of Spread. In Lostorage Conflated series, she is chosen to become Selector again in the new Selector Battle. ; : : A shy and timid girl, who possesses the LRIG card, Midoriko. Her wish is to have friends, which she appears to fulfil herself after Ruko and Yuzuki befriend her. However, upon losing three battles, she becomes unable to make friends, losing her memories and becoming pained by any thoughts or attempts at friendship. Later on, she receives another LRIG card containing Yuzuki and becomes a Selector again, while becoming a bit more cold after her next fight with Ruko. In her final fight with Ruko, Hitoe reveals to have gotten her memory back a while back, revealing her cold act to be a facade, and wanted to become an Eternal Girl to help free Yuzuki from her card. She becomes friends with them again after this. In Lostorage Conflated series, she is chosen to become Selector again in the new Selector Battle. ; : : A fashion model who, despite having a cute personality in public, is actually incredibly sadistic. She has a strong hatred towards Iona, her wish being to ruin her life. She possesses the LRIG card, Piruluk. She ends up losing three battles and receives a large scar on her face, ruining her modelling career. In Spread, she receives another LRIG, Milulun, and falls for Ulith, following anything she orders her to do. In the series finale of Spread, she is shown to be working by Iona's side, and has a book about her resolution on blue WIXOSS decks. In Lostorage Conflated series, she is still working as a model and is chosen to become a Selector again. ; : : An energetic school girl who possesses the LRIG card, Eldora. She is delusional about WIXOSS believing that it is her destiny to be the heroine in the game just like in the novel she likes to read, not taking the consequences of the game seriously. As such, her wish is to become a LRIG much to Eldora's annoyance. She is eliminated when she suffers her third loss in a battle against Hitoe that Eldora lost on purpose to spare her the pain of battles by having the reverse of her wish become reality. In the series end of Spread, she is seen with a note as Ruko passes her. ; : : A novelist who is the author of the WIXOSS novel that Chiyori likes to read. It is later revealed that Futase was previously the real Fumio's LRIG, who took over her body after Fumio became an Eternal Girl, her experiences serving as inspiration for her book. In the last episode of Spread, both Futase and Fumio return to their own bodies. ; : : The real Iona Urazoe who made a contract with Yuki, whom she simply referred as 'LRIG'. Her wish is to no longer be Iona Urazoe since she grew tired of many people's expectation for her to succeed her family's business. Once her wish is fulfilled, she met Mayu in the white room who then told her the entire truth behind the Selector battle, but Iona was content with the truth since her wish has been fulfilled. This angered Mayu and as the result, Mayu purposely sent her as an LRIG of Selectors who are not compatible with the battle. After Ulith's wish is fulfilled, Iona returns to her hollow body since Tama refused to enter it. At the end of Spread, it is shown that she's still working beside Akira. LRIGs ; : : Yuzuki's LRIG, red in color, composed and keen. After Yuzuki fulfills her battle conditions, Hanayo takes over Yuzuki's body in order to receive her wish. Initially, approaches Kazuki only to fulfil Yuzuki's wish, Hanayo started to develop genuine feelings for Kazuki as they spent their times together. This makes her feel no longer able to fulfil Yuzuki's wish out of fear that she will become a Selector to wish to be happy with Kazuki and betray Yuzuki. She is freed after Ruko's wish in the series finale of Spread, seen as a human with short hair observing Kazuki and Yuzuki briefly near a playground. ; : : Hitoe's LRIG, green in color, passionate and loyal. She is sent to another Selector after Hitoe lost her third battle. At the end of Spread, she is seen as a human, meeting Hitoe on a bus. ; : : Akira's LRIG, blue in color. Her personality is cold and indifferent, which, as Akira remarks, is reminiscent of Iona. Following Ruko's wish, she is seen as a human in the end of Spread reading a magazine. She appears again in Lostorage series. ; : : Iona's LRIG, black in color. Her original name is . She has a sadistic personality similar to Akira and enjoys mocking weaker opponents. After Iona becomes an Eternal Girl, she takes over Iona's body, later becoming Tama's new Selector. She eventually becomes another Eternal Girl, with Iona's body returning to its original owner. She becomes Mayu's LRIG since her new wish is to become an LRIG of a selector who can bring greater despair to others. When Mayu gives Ruko a chance for an instant win if she correctly guess what the colour of her card is, Ruko correctly guessed that Mayu's card has no colour, resulting with Mayu's loss and Ulith destroyed into nothingness. ; : : Chiyori's LRIG, blue in color, who cares more for her well being than her own. She loses their third battle so that Chiyori's wish to play WIXOSS forever will be reversed and she won't end up as an LRIG. After losing, she climbs out of her card and leaves. She can be seen at the end of WIXOSS Spread, nervously peeking from behind a wall whilst Chiyori reads the note Eldora left her asking if she would like to be friends. ; : : Akira's second LRIG. Also blue in colour. Like Akira, she acts cheery and lively, but has shown indifference towards the suffering of others, as shown when she mocks Akira after the latter was shocked by Ulith's betrayal.

She established the first English- language school in Central America. She also spent over 30 years establishing free schools in Wilmington, North Carolina. Early years She was born September 12, 1823, in East Vassalboro, Maine. She was a granddaughter of Asa Bradley, a soldier of the American Revolution. When she was six years old, her mother died, leaving a large family of children, Amy being the youngest. Career In 1840, she began to teach in country schools, and four years later was appointed principal of one of the grammar schools in Gardiner, Maine. In 1846, she became assistant teacher in the Winthrop grammar school of Charlestown, Massachusetts, and afterward in the Putnam Grammar School, East Cambridge, Massachusetts. She taught until the autumn of 1849, when, hampered by pneumonia, she was compelled to seek a milder climate. The winter of 1850-51 was passed in Charleston, South Carolina at the home of a brother, but with little benefit; and during the two years following, she was an invalid at her old home in Maine.  Time in Central America  She was advised by her physician to live somewhere that was free from frost, in 1853, she went to San Jose, Costa Rica, where her health improved. In three months after her arrival, she established the first English school in Central America. She quickly mastered the Spanish language, and her pupils rapidly acquired the English. For nearly four years, she continued her educational work in San Jose.  Spanish Skills  In the summer of 1857, Bradley returned to her early home in East Vassalboro, where her father died in January, 1858. The knowledge of Spanish acquired by Bradley in Costa Rica led the New England Glass Company, of East Cambridge to seek her services in translating letters.  American Civil War service  She was in Cambridge in 1861, when the first gun was fired at Fort Sumter. After the First Battle of Bull Run, she offered her services to the government as an army nurse. On 1 September 1861, she began working at the hospital of the Third Maine Regiment, encamped near Alexandria, Virginia. She was transferred to the Fifth Maine Regiment, and was soon appointed matron of the Seventeenth Brigade Hospital, General Slocum's Brigade, of which she had charge during the winter. In the spring of 1862, she responded to a call from the Relief Department of the United States Sanitary Commission, and went with Dorothea Dix to Fort Monroe. She was assigned to service on the transport boats, and labored throughout the Peninsula Campaign. In December, 1862, she was sent to Convalescent Camp, Alexandria, and remained in charge of the Relief Department until the close of the American Civil War. Wilmington schools Bradley in later years In 1866, at the request of the Soldiers' Memorial Society, of Boston, Massachusetts, and under the auspices of the American Unitarian Association, she went to Wilmington, North Carolina, as a teacher of poor white children. Her position at first was a trying one, for she was a stranger and a northerner. She opened her school on 9 January 1867, with three children, in a humble building. Within a week, 67 pupils were enrolled, and soon two additional teachers were engaged by her, and, as the number of pupils rapidly increased, new schools were opened, the \\"Hemenway,\\" the \\"Pioneer\\" and the \\"Normal,\\" and the corps of teachers increased accordingly. Within a few months, citizens co-operated with the trustees of the Peabody Fund and other benefactors in erecting the needed buildings and forwarding the work started by Bradley. On 13 November 1871, the cornerstone of the Tileston Normal School was laid, and it was opened in October, 1872. This building was the gift of Mary Tileston Hemenway, who had been interested in Bradley's work from its beginning, and whose appreciation of its importance found expression in the annual contribution of US$5,000 toward the support of the Tileston Normal School, from its opening in 1872 to its close in 1891. Failing health led Miss Bradley to resign her position in 1891. In all, Bradley spent over 30 years establishing free schools in Wilmington. A collection of Bradley's manuscripts, papers, and diaries reside at the Duke University Library in Durham, North Carolina. Bradley's religious affiliation was a Unitarian. She died in January 1904. She is buried at Oakdale Cemetery in Wilmington, North Carolina.

The attack took place on the last day of a controversial referendum on Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence from Yugoslavia, in the early stages of the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars. In response to the shooting, Serb Democratic Party (SDS) irregulars set up barricades and roadblocks across Sarajevo, accusing the Bosnian Muslim Party of Democratic Action (SDA) of orchestrating the attack. The SDS demanded that Serb-inhabited areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina be patrolled by Serbs, and not by police officers of other ethnicities, and further called for United Nations peacekeepers to be deployed to the country. On 3 March, the SDS agreed to dismantle the barricades it had erected. The Muslim-dominated People's Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared the country's independence the same day. Gardović is often regarded as the first casualty of the Bosnian War. Ramiz Delalić, a career criminal allegedly under the protection of the SDA, was quickly identified as a suspect, but the Bosnian Muslim authorities made little effort to locate him in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. During the war, Delalić led a militia that persecuted Sarajevo's Serb population. He later admitted to carrying out the attack in a televised interview. In 2004, Delalić was charged with one count of first-degree murder in relation to Gardović's death, but was shot and killed in 2007, before his trial could be completed. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country's semi- autonomous Bosniak–Croat entity, 1 March is celebrated as Independence Day. The holiday is not observed in the semi-autonomous Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska and most Bosnian Serbs associate the date with the wedding attack rather than with the independence referendum. The shooting was dramatized in the 1998 British war film Welcome to Sarajevo. Background Following the death of its longtime leader Josip Broz Tito in 1980, the multi- ethnic socialist state of Yugoslavia entered a period of protracted economic stagnation and decline. The anemic state of the country's economy resulted in a substantial increase in ethnic tensions which were only exacerbated by the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989. The following year, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia permitted democratic elections to be held nationwide. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, political parties were established largely along ethnic lines. The Bosnian Muslims founded the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) to represent their interests, the Bosnian Serbs founded the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) and the Bosnian Croats founded the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH). The three parties were led by Alija Izetbegović, Radovan Karadžić and Stjepan Kljuić, respectively. Bosnia and Herzegovina held its first democratic election on 18 November 1990. The voting was dominated by nationalist parties such as the SDA, SDS and HDZ BiH. Socialist parties with no ethnic affiliation, most notably the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina, failed to win a significant percentage of the vote. The SDA and HDZ BiH, representing the aspirations of most Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats, advocated for Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence from Yugoslavia, a move opposed by the SDS and the vast majority of Bosnian Serbs. On 25 June, the governments of Slovenia and Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, leading to the Ten-Day War and the Croatian War of Independence, the first armed conflicts of what would become known as the Yugoslav Wars. In accordance with the RAM Plan, devised by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) as early as 1990, the State Security Administration began disseminating small arms to the Bosnian Serb population, resulting in the establishment of a number of Bosnian Serb militias across Bosnia and Herzegovina by the end of 1991. In November 1991, the SDS organized a plebiscite, boycotted by Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats, in which the vast majority of Bosnian Serbs voted to remain part of Yugoslavia. The following month, an arbitration commission established by the European Economic Community (EEC) declared that a legally binding nationwide independence referendum would be a prerequisite for the EEC's eventual recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence. A nationwide independence referendum was thus scheduled to be held between 29 February and 1 March. The SDS rejected such a referendum as unconstitutional. Consequently, at the party's urging, the vast majority of Bosnian Serbs boycotted it. On 9 January 1992, the SDS announced the establishment of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a self-proclaimed autonomous entity which was to include all the municipalities in which more than 50 percent of voters had voted to remain part of Yugoslavia. Like much of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the capital Sarajevo was ethnically and religiously diverse. According to the 1991 Yugoslav population census, the city had 525,980 inhabitants, 49.3 percent of whom identified as Bosnian Muslims, 29.9 percent of whom identified as Serbs, 10.7 percent of whom identified as Yugoslavs and 6.6 percent of whom identified as Croats. Attack Church of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel in Sarajevo On Sunday, 1 March 1992, the final day of voting, the wedding of a Bosnian Serb couple, Milan Gardović and Dijana Tambur, was held at the Church of the Holy Transfiguration in Novo Sarajevo. The groom was a seminarian in his final year of study. His father, Nikola, was a sacristan at the Church of the Holy Transfiguration. The historian Kenneth Morrison describes the atmosphere in Sarajevo that day as \\"tense\\". Following the ceremony, the newlyweds, their respective families and the wedding guests drove to the Church of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel, colloquially known as the Old Orthodox Church, in the city's old Muslim quarter of Baščaršija, where a wedding meal was supposed to be held. The Church of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel was Sarajevo's oldest Serbian Orthodox religious building. Because there was no parking space in the immediate vicinity of the Church of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel, the wedding party decided to head towards the church on foot, forming a procession that stretched from the nearest parking lot to the church itself. During the procession, members of the wedding party brandished Serbian flags, which many Bosnian Muslim passersby interpreted as a deliberate provocation. Such processions were typical of Serb weddings across Yugoslavia. They were usually accompanied by the honking of car horns and the singing of songs. Around 2:30 p.m., four young men emerged from a white Volkswagen Golf and attempted to seize a flag from one of the wedding guests. A scuffle ensued, and according to eyewitnesses, one of the men opened fire at the procession. Viktor Meier, a correspondent writing for the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, was a chance eyewitness to the attack, and wrote of it in his 1995 book Yugoslavia: A History of its Demise. \\"At first, it seemed to be a detonator,\\" Meier wrote of the gunshots, \\"but then I saw people in a frenzy; I heard cries and saw someone run to the nearest telephone and saw the terrified faces of passers-by [sic].\\" Gardović's father was killed in the attack, and a Serbian Orthodox priest, Radenko Mirović, was wounded. Aftermath Response \\"The emotional charge of the incident was strong on both sides,\\" the historian Mladen Ančić writes, \\"because a Serb wedding procession, displaying Serb symbols, on its way to the oldest Serb church in Sarajevo was stopped by a Muslim bullet.\\" For most Serbs, the attack represented \\"a point of no return\\", the historian John R. Schindler writes. The shooting was immediately denounced by SDS officials. Karadžić said the attack proved that the independence movement posed an existential threat to the Bosnian Serbs. \\"This shot was a great injustice aimed at the Serb people,\\" the President of the People's Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Momčilo Krajišnik, remarked. SDS spokesman Rajko Dukić stated that the wedding attack was evidence that Sarajevo's Serbs were \\"in mortal danger\\" and argued that an independent Bosnia and Herzegovina would threaten the Bosnian Serbs' security even further. Izetbegović condemned the murder, calling it \\"a shot at all Bosnia\\". The mayor of Sarajevo's Stari Grad municipality, Selim Hadžibajrić, expressed his condolences to Gardović's family. The Bosnian Muslim paramilitary leader Sefer Halilović, who had founded the militia known as the Patriotic League in March 1991, struck a different tone. Halilović claimed that the procession \\"wasn't really a wedding, but a provocation\\", and that the members of the wedding party were SDS activists. \\"They wanted to go through Baščaršija with the cars, with the flags, with the banners, to provoke us and see how we would react,\\" Halilović remarked. The attack prompted a \\"competition for urban space that would develop into the outright besieging and division of the city,\\" the historian Catherine Baker writes. Roadblocks and barricades quickly appeared across Sarajevo, first Bosnian Serb ones and then Bosnian Muslim ones. The SDS demanded that Serb-inhabited areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina be patrolled by Serbs, and not by police officers of other ethnicities, and further called for United Nations peacekeepers to be deployed to the country. Two days after the attack, the SDS agreed to remove the barricades it had erected. This breakthrough was achieved by the JNA general Milutin Kukanjac, who successfully convinced the leaders of the SDA and SDS to allow joint patrols by the JNA and Bosnian Police. The same day, Izetbegović declared the independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Muslim- dominated People's Assembly quickly ratified the decision. Gardović was buried in Sarajevo on 4 March. His funeral was officiated by the bishop Vasilije Kačavenda. \\"I will not say, as some unintelligent politicians have, that the shot that killed this man was a shot at Bosnia,\\" Kačavenda remarked during his eulogy. \\"But it was a warning to our three nations. Let Nikola's sacrifice be the last of these crazy times.\\" Coverage of the attack largely eclipsed that of the concurrent referendum. Serbian newspapers largely portrayed the attack as one for which all Bosnian Muslims bore collective responsibility. The following passage from the Belgrade daily Politika was typical: \\"The killers of the Serb wedding guest are not the three attackers, but those who created the atmosphere which abolished Bosnia-Herzegovina once and for all.\\" The Sarajevo daily Oslobođenje veered in the opposite direction, attempting to obfuscate the attackers' ethnic identities. A column published a day after the attack read: \\"The killers of the wedding guest at Baščaršija, hate-mongers and barricade-builders, were not only not Sarajevans, they were not even true Bosnians, but strangers.\\" The column went on to insinuate that the wedding procession had been a deliberate provocation. Many Serb readers considered Oslobođenje's reaction to the attack insensitive and sent angry letters to the editor in response. Miroslav Janković, a Serb member of the newspaper's editorial board, vented his fury at the following day's board meeting, describing the column as \\"the most shameless thing this newspaper has published in fifty years.\\" Responsibility Eyewitnesses identified the individual who fired at the wedding procession as Ramiz Delalić, a career criminal. The SDS leadership immediately blamed the SDA for the attack and alleged that Delalić was under the SDA's protection. Prior to the attack, Delalić had been implicated in another shooting, as well as a rape, and had received treatment at a psychiatric hospital. On 3 March 1992, the local authorities had issued a warrant for Delalić's arrest, but made little effort to find him. SDS officials alleged that the authorities' failure to arrest Delalić was evidence of the SDA's complicity in the attack. During the siege of Sarajevo, Delalić led a Bosnian Muslim paramilitary unit that attacked and murdered Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Muslim civilians. The impunity entrusted Delalić by the Bosnian Muslim authorities was such that he openly admitted to opening fire on the wedding guests in a televised interview. The authorities only cracked down on Delalić's militia in late 1993 after it began targeting non-Serbs. On 1 March 1997, the fifth anniversary of the wedding attack, Delalić publicly threatened a father and son inside a Sarajevo restaurant, and brandished a pistol in front of patrons, an offence for which he was later convicted. In June 1999, he ran over and injured a police officer with his car, and was again imprisoned. This latter incident prompted Carlos Westendorp, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, to urge the country's authorities to investigate Delalić's wartime activities. On 8 December 2004, Delalić was charged with one count of first degree murder in relation to the wedding attack. His trial commenced on 14 February 2005. On the first day of court proceedings, prosecutors played the jury a videotape of the wedding attack, which appeared to show Delalić firing at the procession. The same day, Delalić posted bail and was released on his own recognizance. On 27 June 2007, before his trial could be completed, Delalić was shot and killed by unidentified gunmen in Sarajevo. On 19 September 2012, prosecutors in Sarajevo charged the Kosovo Albanian drug lord Naser Kelmendi with ordering Delalić's murder. Kelmendi had fled Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2012 after being sanctioned under the United States' Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. He was also indicted on several counts of drug trafficking. He was arrested by the Kosovo Police in Pristina on 6 May 2013. Since Bosnia and Herzegovina does not recognize Kosovo, and thus has no extradition agreement with it, Kelmendi was tried in Pristina for crimes that he was alleged to have committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In October 2016, the senior Bosniak politician Fahrudin Radončić, who had been acquainted with Delalić, testified in Kelmendi's defense. In 2012, Radončić had been named in Kelmendi's indictment as one of the plotters in the conspiracy to kill Delalić, but was never personally charged and denied the allegations. Radončić testified that Delalić had told him that the wedding attack had been ordered by Izetbegović and the SDA. Radončić further testified that Delalić's assassination had been ordered by \\"the Bosniak state mafia\\", and not by Kelmendi, because Delalić had wished to discuss the Izetbegović family's alleged involvement in organized crime with prosecutors. On 1 February 2018, Kelmendi was convicted on one count of drug trafficking and sentenced to six years' imprisonment; he was acquitted on all counts relating to Delalić's murder. Legacy Nikola Gardović is often considered the first casualty of the Bosnian War. Among Bosnian Serbs, the attack is commonly referred to as the Bloody Wedding. The political scientist Keith Crawford describes the attack and the Sijekovac massacre of Bosnian Serb civilians in Bosanski Brod on 27 March as the two incidents that effectively precipitated the conflict. The Indian academic Radha Kumar has compared the wedding attack to violent incidents that have preceded inter-communal violence in India. On 6 April, the EEC and the United States recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent state. The same day, the Bosnian Serb leadership declared the independence of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later renamed Republika Srpska. Bosnia and Herzegovina was admitted into the UN on 22 May. The ensuing Bosnian War left 100,000 dead; an additional two million were displaced. The war ended with the signing of the Dayton Agreement in December 1995, in which the warring parties agreed to divide the country into two semi-autonomous entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. Following the war, most of Republika Srpska's wartime leadership was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Among them was Karadžić, who was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as genocide for his role in the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, and sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2019. Fleeing the war, Milan and Dijana Gardović immigrated to Sweden, where Milan now serves as a Serbian Orthodox priest. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1 March is celebrated as Independence Day, a non-working holiday. Independence Day is not observed in Republika Srpska and most Bosnian Serbs associate the date with the wedding attack rather than with the independence referendum. The attack was dramatized in the 1997 British war film Welcome to Sarajevo, with Bosnian Serb paramilitaries as the perpetrators and Bosnian Croat civilians as the victims. \\"These changes were introduced obviously for political reasons,\\" the film scholar Goran Gocić opines. The anthropologist Stephen Harper concurs.

It is located within the Municipal District of Pincher Creek No. 9 south of the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass, northwest of Waterton Lakes National Park and west of the Town of Pincher Creek. It shares a boundary with Castle Wildland Provincial Park to the west and south. The designation of Castle Provincial Park was approved on January 20, 2017 with an effective date of February 16, 2017. The designation involved the protection of of land. The namesake is derived from Windsor Ridge and the West and South Castle Rivers that flow through the park. The park is an important link in the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem, providing a habitat and migratory corridor for a variety of wildlife such as grizzly bears, black bears, wolverines, cougars, bobcats, deer, elk, and moose. Visitors amenities at the Castle Provincial Park include four campgrounds, one group use campground, comfort camping, and multiple staging areas for day use. Camp Impeesa is also situated on the Beaver Mines Lake, run by Scouts Canada. Furthermore, random camping exists throughout the park and situated at the end of the main highway in the park is Castle Mountain Resort, a ski resort. Popular activities include camping, hiking, boating, skiing, horseback riding, hunting, mountain biking, and fishing.  History   Indigenous history  The first known people in the Castle Provincial Park was the Kutenai and Piikani First Nations. Their history with the land is over 10,000 years old and they called the area \\"A'saani\\", meaning scared paint. This region was used for spiritual ceremonies and to sustain their ways of life through hunting, food gathering, and the removal of firewood. These First Nations People were the guides of early explorers and traders in the Castle. When Western Canada began settlement, the indigenous populations declined due to clashes with the Niitsitapi, Ktunaxa, smallpox, and the designation of reservations beginning in 1855 with the Lame Bull Treaty.  Early exploration  Trade and settlement began east on the prairies earlier than in the Castle. Early surveyors included Peter Fidler and David Thompson, but exploration began with the Palliser Expedition in 1841, led by James Sinclair. The Hudson's Bay Company, who funded the Palliser Expedition, was interested in more efficient trade routes over the mountains and the British government was interested in growing the Dominion of Canada westward. In 1857, John Palliser entered the area in search of the quickest route over the Continental Divide, crossing over the North Kootenany Pass and into the Flathead Valley in August 1858. Additionally, in 1858 Thomas Blakiston entered the region, who is more commonly known for his explorations in the Waterton Lakes National Park. Early geological studies were first performed from 1857 to 1859 by Dr. James Hector of the Palliser Expedition of western British North America. By 1861, Dr. Hector named what is now known as Windsor Ridge today as Castle Mountain, renamed in 1979 in conjunction to the renaming of Mount Eisenhower in Banff National Park to Castle Mountain. alt=  Park formation  The Castle Provincial Park was first protected in 1908 under the Dominion Lands Acts as a part of the Rocky Mountain Forest Reserve which covered the Eastern Rocky Mountain Slopes north from the United States border. In 1914, the southern portion of the Castle Provincial Park was protected under Waterton Forest Park but by 1921, these protections were reduced to a federal Forest Reserve designation. This trend of protectionism and privatization continued until the Castle Provincial Park and Castle Wildland Provincial Park was announced under the N.D.P. Rachel Notley government in 2015. This announcement was formalized two years later in February 2017.  Climate  leftThe Castle Provincial Park has a unique climate which has allowed the growth of many unique plant and animal species. This climate is formed because of the transition of subalpine forest to tundra, and is characterized by short summers interchanged with long, snowy winters. Precipitation varies throughout the park due to the interplay of the Pacific Maritime and Arctic Continental air masses. Factors of climate concern in the Castle Provincial Park include wind exposure, moisture patterns such as snow accumulation and availability, volcanic debris, topography, and seasonal temperature changes. These climate forces can result in strong winds, Chinooks, and heavy snowfalls. Nearest temperature data from the Crowsnest Pass, north of the Castle Wildland Provincial Park, shows an average summer temperature of 11 to 16 degrees Celsius and average winter temperatures from −4 to 0 degrees Celsius, with 102 cm of average snowfall.  Art in the Park  View from Summit Pass in Waterton Lakes National Park, painted by James Madison Alden, 1857–1862. Due to its naturally stunning vistas, the Castle Provincial Park was recognized by nature preservationists. Naturalists first found this park to be a unique ecosystem a place to study as it is the habitat of many unique species such as the Whitebark Pine and Limber Pine, which are endangered trees protected under the Wildlife Act of the Ministry of Alberta's Environment and Sustainable Resources. The first landscapes of the Waterton and surrounding areas were painted by military artists Charles Wilson and James Madison Alden. Because of the vantage points offered by the peaks in the Waterton Lakes National Park and Flathead Valley, portions of the Castle Provincial Park were featured in the background of Alden's paintings.

Influenced by the European modern movement led by Le Corbusier and other architects, Greek architects tried to adapt these principles into Greek practice. However, conservatism was often a hindering factor and usually both classically inspired as well as modernist buildings were built during the same periods. Prelude The polykatoikía (condominium) The apartment building built between 1918–1919 by Alexandros Metaxas for Petros Giannaros. The term πολυκατοικία (polykatoikia, literally \\"multiresidence\\") is used in Greek to denote every apartment building. One of the first, if not the first, apartment buildings in Athens was built in 1918–1919 by architect Alexandros Metaxas in an eclectic style for Petros Giannaros on Philellinon and Othonos Streets, adjacently to Syntagma Square. Thanks to the fact that this building was one of the first ones to be built with reinforced concrete, it was unexpectedly, as well as asymmetrically higher than the adjacent ones. This caused a fury and led to two royal decrees, one in 1919 and another one in 1922 that in the end set the height for buildings according to the width of the street they lay on, with a maximum height of 26 metres for wide streets.Sarigiannis 2012Μέγαρο Γιάνναρου at the Contemporary Momuments Database (Αρχείο Νεωτέρων Μνημείων). Retrieved 17 January 2017.ΦΕΚ Α 164/07.09.1922. The changes that took place in Greek society after the defeat of Greece during the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, and the ensuing population exchange between Greece and Turkey created different housing needs for the population, revealed how important the construction sector could be for the Greek economy, and influenced, as a result, the legal framework of the polykatoikia. In 1929, two important laws concerning apartment buildings took effect. The law about \\"horizontal property\\" (οριζόντια ιδιοκτησία) made it possible that many different owners own one apartment building, each by owning one or more apartment units. Theoretically, each apartment corresponds to a percentage of the original plot. The most important effect of this law was the practice of \\"αντιπαροχή\\" (antiparochì, literally \\"a supply in exchange\\"). With antiparochì, the owner of a plot, who can't afford to build an apartment building by himself, makes a contract with a construction company so that the latter will build the apartment building but keep the ownership of as many apartments as the contract states. Although during the interwar period the practice of antiparochì was limited, as the construction of most apartment buildings was financed solely by the original owners of the plot, antiparochì became the most common method for financing the construction of condominiums (polykatoikìes) from the 1950s onwards.Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 65–67. Later in 1929 came into effect the first General Building Regulation. Most importantly, not only did it regulate the height and surface area of the buildings, but it also introduced innovations that their use came to characterize the modern style of the buildings of the era, such as the bay windows, or erkers (έρκερ), as they are known in Greek after the German term.ΦΕΚ Α 155/22.04.1929. Conservatism between 1900–1930 Papaleonardou's apartment building, designed in 1925 by Kostas Kitsikis, incorporates Art Deco elements creating thus an eclectic style.

During the first two decades of the 20th century, Greek architecture failed to follow international trends, especially Art Nouveau and, to a lesser extent, Art Deco, or to produce an architectural style with consistent features that could act as a successor to Greek Neoclassicism.Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 11–13 As a result, buildings in Athens that can be characterized as 'Art Nouveau' are scarce. The tumultuous changes and poor economic state of the Greek society must be taken into account when studying this period.Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 15–17 Most architects of that period that built in Athens were conservative and late in adopting other non-classical European styles, often altering them and mingling them with classical motifs, creating thus an eclectic style.Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 13–15 The building of Bank of Greece, designed in 1933 in a conservative simplified classical style. During the last part of this period and under the influence of Anastasios Metaxas's work (1862–1937), most public buildings were built in a so-called \\"simplified classical\\" style (αφαιρετικός κλασικισμός), similar to \\"stripped classicism\\". Such buildings include classical ornamentation albeit in a much lesser degree;Giacumacatos 2009, p. 19 Art Deco ornamentation also becomes much more common. Such buildings, with their imposing façades, usually emit grandeur and austerity. The most important building of this style is the Bank of Greece on Panepistimiou Street built between 1933–1938 by a team of architects led by Nikolaos Zoumpoulidis, Kimon Laskaris, and Konstantinos Papadakis. Although it is relatively lightly decorated, every ornament is classical in style and its façade is even reminiscent of the Greek parliament, designed in 1834.Τράπεζα της Ελλάδος at the Contemporary Momuments Database (Αρχείο Νεωτέρων Μνημείων).

Recent graduates of the School of Architecture of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) which was founded in 1917, as well as graduates from other European architectural schools managed to make Modernism much more popular. A very ambitious plan was the construction of many public schools, not only in Athens but in all of Greece, by the Ministry of Education of the 1928–1932 Venizelos government. The program was led by architect Nikos Mitsakis (1899–1941), a graduate of the NTUA, who, in 1930, was appointed director of the office for the construction of the new schools. The designs of the new schools are based on Le Corbusier's principles, are completely unadorned with large horizontal windows, and are built with abundant and cheap materials such as stonemasonry and reinforced concrete.Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 41–43 Some of the most important examples of modern school architecture are Dimitris Pikionis's school under Mount Lycabettus designed in 1931, Kyriakos Panagiotakos's school in Pangrati designed in 1933, and many others. During the fourth congress of CIAM that took place in Athens in 1933, the public schools were much discussed.Giacumacatos 2009, p. 45 During his visit in Athens for the congress, Le Corbusier visited a school designed by Panagiotakos on Liosion Street and wrote \\"Compliments de Le Corbusier\\" on its wall.Fessas-Emmanouil 2009, p. 215 The cityscape of Athens in the 1930s was formed, though, by the great number of modern private apartment buildings that were built during that decade. Many neighbourhoods of Athens saw a construction spree fuelled by a more powerful middle and upper-middle class that were friendly to modernism and wanted to invest in property, as well as by the increase of population. Such neighbourhoods include Kolonaki, Exarcheia, Kypseli, the area around Amerikis Square, and other central areas. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and Erich Mendelsohn,Giacumacatos 2009, p. 57 as well as more conservative architects such as Michel Roux-Spitz,Filippa Dimitriadi citing Eva Manidaki and Thanasis Demiris in \\"Οι «ψηφιδωτές» πολυκατοικίες των Αθηνών\\", Popaganda.gr, 18 April 2016. Retrieved 17 January 2017 virtually every apartment building that was built in Athens during that decade followed this style. These buildings are characterized by the bay windows which can protrude up to 1.4 metres under the 1929 General Building Regulation, the non- existent or subtle ornamentation such as occasional Art Deco motifs, especially on ironwork, and spacious entry halls. They often have permanent decorative pergolas on the terraces of the top floors. The use of bay windows produces a plasticity effect to the façades. An example of an apartment building with completely unadorned façades and many bay windows is the famous Ble Polykatoikia near Exarcheia Square designed in 1932 by Kyriakos Panagiotakos.\\"K.

The Metaxas regime and initial post-World War II conservatism Stagnation during the Metaxas regime Although Ioannis Metaxas's dictatorship (1936–1941) didn't forcibly impose an official architectural style, nor banned modern architecture, it awoke Greek society's conservative ideas and influenced, as a result, architecture. Public buildings were still built according to simplified classicism.Giacumacatos 2009, p. 59 For example, the Municipal Market of Kypseli, which was inaugurated in 1937 by the dictator and was designed by architect Alexandros Metaxas (the two are unrelated), includes a classical cornice and small ionic capitals, despite the fact that it is a special-purpose building.Fessas-Emmanouil 2009, p. 230 Something that also changed significantly the appearance of Athenian buildings was the reduction of the maximum possible protrusion of the bay windows from 1.4 metres to 40 centimetres in 1937. Architect and professor at the NTUA Kostas Kitsikis had lobbied extensively for this change because he thought that builders and owners abused long bay windows in order to build as much surface area as they could, turning Athens into \\"a bad copy of German and Dutch cities.\\"Frantziskakis 1965, p. 48 Two apartment buildings on Aigyptou Square, near Pedion Areos.

The simplified classicism of the 1930s remained dominant and only slightly changed well into the 1950s. Again, public and other important buildings but this time also apartment buildings were decorated with classically orientated ornaments. Main entrance doors, railings, and lighting sconces were made of richly decorated ironwork. Often, balustrades were used instead of railings. White marble was used extensively, especially in entry halls which were often very spacious and white was the preferred colour of the façades. However, in contrast with pre- war simplified classicism, the façades of the newer buildings often included a grid which was formed by balconies and thin vertical columns. Many apartment buildings that were built during that era in Kolonaki and other central upscale neighbourhoods of Athens were designed by architects preferred by the upper-middle class such as Emmanouil Vourekas and Konstantinos Kapsampelis.Giacumacatos 2009, p. 69 The modernism of the 1960s The Air Force Assistance Fund building designed in 1947 by Thoukydidis Valentis.

Already since 1949, the completion of the Greek Air Force Assistance Fund building on Akadimias Street, which was designed in 1947 by Thoukydidis Valentis, showed the course that most office buildings in central Athens would follow. The building is completely undecorated with a subtly visible concrete frame in the form of a grid, and has many Corbusian principles such as the ground floor pilotis. Valentis had a consistent ideology behind the design principles of office buildings concerning practicality and aesthetics which he later in 1960 wrote down in Architektoniki [Architecture] review.Valentis 1960 Some years later, two young architects, Nikos Valsamakis (born in 1924) and Takis Zenetos (1926–1977) also exerted much influence in revitalizing Greek modernism. Their buildings, notably one of Valsamakis's first apartment buildings on Semitelou Street (1951) and Zenetos's Fix brewery on Syngrou Avenue (1957, now partly demolished and renovated houses the National Museum of Contemporary Art), are radically different from their contemporary counterparts. Valsamakis's apartment building on Semitelou Street is devoid of any ornament and has a façade grid formed by balconies and columns. Moreover, its design is inspired by traditional architecture only in matters of materials, such as the stonemasonry of the ground floor and wooden elements elsewhere, and colouring, such as the contrast between white and bright red.\\"Louros apartment building\\" at Discovering contemporary architecture in Paris and the Ile-de-France region, London and Athens .

Mature developments The office building at the start of Ermou Street on Syntagma Square. It was designed in 1961 by Dimitris Papazisis and its interior by Takis Zenetos. It has a curtain wall made of I-beams, marble, and glass. Gradually, apart from Le Corbusier's principles such as pilotis and horizontal windows, also post-war International Style came to influence most buildings in Athens. Also, the grid on façades, especially those of office buildings, became one of the most important fields in design innovation. Departing from Valentis's Corbusian proto-Brutalist accentuated grid made of permanent masonry, glass and aluminium curtain walls started to take over. Valsamakis's office building on Kapnikareas Square (1958) and Dimitris Papazisis's office building on Syntagma Square (1961) were the first buildings in Athens where a full blown curtain wall similar in fashion to those of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was implemented.Κτήριο Γραφείων Ερμού και Καπνικαρέας 9 at Domesindex.com database of contemporary Greek architecture.

The Appalachian region of the Southeastern United States is a leading producer of coal in the country. Research shows that people who live in close proximity to mountaintop removal (MTR) mines have higher mortality rates than average, and are more likely to live in poverty and be exposed to harmful environmental conditions than people in otherwise comparable parts of the region. In the late 1990s, several Appalachian women, including Julia Bonds, began to speak out against MTR and its effects on the people and environment of mining communities. Research has shown that MTR is causing \\"irreparable\\" environmental damage in Appalachia. The blasting of mountaintops has polluted stream and water supplies have been contaminated by toxic waste from coal processing called slurry ponds. Scientists have noted an increase in respiratory and heart problems among area residents, including lung cancer. Mortality rates and birth defect rates are higher in the areas surrounding surface mining locations. Coal mining production in Appalachia declined from 1990 to 2015, but there is some debate over why. Cited factors include a rising demand for clean energy, environmental policies and regulations set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and globalization. The number of coal mining jobs in the region remained steady from 2000 to 2010, but declined by 37% between 2011 and 2015. Less production is responsible for much of this job loss, but improved mining techniques like mountain-top removal also contributed. Discourse around coal in the area has sparked a debate in academia over whether it creates wealth or poverty. The core debate centers around coal production's impact on local and national economy. Background Coal production Appalachia is one of three coal-mining regions in the United States; the others are the Interior coal region, and the Western coal region, which includes the Powder River Basin. Eight states lie in the Appalachian coal region: Alabama, eastern Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.Where the United States gets its coal, U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (last updated April 21, 2017). West Virginia is the largest coal-producing state in Appalachia, and the second-largest coal-producing state in the United States, accounting for about 11% of the nation's total coal production in 2014 (the largest coal-producing state is Wyoming, which lies in the Western coal region and accounts for 40% of U.S. coal production). Two other states in the Appalachian coal region, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, account for 8% and 6% of U.S. coal production, respectively. The coal industry in Appalachia has changed over time. According to U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration data, Central Appalachia—consisting of southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, western Virginia, and eastern Tennessee—made up almost 29% of U.S. coal production in the U.S. in 1990, but only about 13% by 2013.Ted Boettner, 7 Things You Need to Know About Why Coal is Declining in West Virginia (1 of 7), West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy (October 23, 2014). By contrast, coal production in Northern Appalachian has remained relatively stable, going from 16% in 1990 to 12.5% in 2013. As a result, \\"both regions account for nearly the same share of U.S. coal production\\" . In the Appalachian coal region, 72% of coal produced came from underground mines. This is a much higher percentage than in the Western coal region, where 90% of all coal produced comes from surface mines. History Historically, \\"the building of coal towns began in the 1880s, peaked in the 1920s, and virtually ended with the coming of the Great Depression\\" when the availability of other forms of energy—namely, oil, gas, and hydroelectricity—reduced demand for coal.Crandall A. Shifflett, Coal Towns: Life, Work, and Culture in Company Towns of Southern Appalachia (University of Tennessee, 1991), p. 33. The company town was particularly dominant in southern Appalachia; in 1925, almost 80% of West Virginia coal miners lived in company towns, while an average of 64.4% of coal miners in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee lived in company towns.Shifflett, pp. 34-34.  Impacts of coal mining in Appalachia  330x330px Since 1995, the Appalachian region has produced about half of the United States' coal. Although Appalachia has played a large role in contributing to the coal supply of the United States, the communities surrounding such mining practices have suffered immensely. Several studies have shown disparities between mining communities and non-mining communities in terms of public health, environmental degradation, pollution, and overall quality of life in Appalachia. Variations of surface coal mining techniques in the Appalachia include contour, area, high-wall, auger, and mountaintop removal mining (MTR). Surface mining The damage caused by mountaintop removal strip mining has had a calculable effect on the environment and communities in Appalachia. The resource rich region remains economically deprived and suffers from the externalities of coal mining, including the health problems caused by coal pollution. The Office of Surface Mining (OSM) is the federal agency tasked with regulating strip-mining under the Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). According to OSM, \\"[t]o the extent that low income populations are prevalent in the coalfields, the impacts of mountaintop mining are felt disproportionately by these environmental justice populations\\". Most local residents are unable to see the extent of the damage that has been caused by surface mining. Geologist Sean P. Bemis investigated claims by local residents that the extent of the damage was not easily visible. In interviews with the research team, former miner Chuck Nelson stated that the extent of the destruction is only clearly visible from a plane. Coalfield resident activist Maria Gunnoe gave a similar account to the researchers, saying \\"I never realized it was so bad. My first fly-over with South Wings [non-profit aviation organization], and that right there is what really fired me up. When I got off the plane that day, I cried all the way across the tarmac, all the way home...\\" The Government Accountability Office (GAO) confirmed this in a 2009 report: There are no official records of the total number of \\"disturbed acres\\" that have resulted from surface mining, but geospatial analysis has shown that between 1.05million and 1.28million acres of land and more than 500 mountains in West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia have been surface mined.  Mountaintop removal  One form of surface mining is mountaintop removal (MTR). This technique may remove up to 800 to 1000 feet of mountaintops, to reach coal seams not accessible by other surface mining techniques. This practice was used on a small scale in the 1970s and became heavily used in the 1990s. This extraction technique became popular because the increased demand for high-grade low- sulfur coal, due to the Clean Air Act amendments passed in 1990. The process of MTR begins by the deforestation of a chosen mountaintop, then it is blasted with explosives. Next all of the excess soil and rock or \\"spoil\\" is moved out, after the mining operation is complete this will be replaced. Once this rock has been disturbed in this process, swelling will take place. The spoil will expand by fifteen to twenty five percent, due to air incorporation and voids. This excess spoil or \\"overburden\\" then is dumped into nearby streams or valleys, this process is called a valley fill. Since the boom in MTR usage as many as 500 mountaintops have been destroyed and 2000 miles of waterways have been filled. Mountaintop mining and valley fills can lead to large scale landscape changes. These may include: fragmentation of forests, conversion of habitats, and loss of large tracts and forested areas. There also may be adverse effects to the people living in these Appalachian mining communities Micheal Hendrix a researcher at Indiana State University, in an interview with Yale, stated that “The number of excess deaths every year comes to about 1,200 people who live in these mining communities compared to other parts of Appalachia.” The diseases most prevalent in these MTR areas include: cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and COPD. These are not only the occupational illnesses of miners but of the general public. Birth defects especially heart defects risk goes up by 181% in MTR areas. Researchers are beginning to research smaller particulate matter as the cause of these illnesses, and increased mortality.  Effects on health  Several studies have found that communities within the Appalachian region surrounding coal mining practices disproportionately experience negative health effects than communities with no coal mining. Such health disparities are largely attributed to the contamination of water and land associated with coal surface mining. MTR has increased salinity, metals, magnesium, and sulfates within Appalachian watersheds, threatening human health. Sixty-three percent of stream beds near coalfields within the Appalachia mountains have been identified as \\"impaired\\" due to high toxic chemical and metal contamination. In West Virginia, 14 counties are experiencing water that exceeds safe drinking water standards by seven times more than non-mining counties. Combustion waste and fly ash from MTR lend to toxic dusts pollute the surrounding air and have contributed to increased levels of cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and kidney disease. Public health costs of pollution in the Appalachia are upwards of 75 billion dollars a year. In a comparative analysis of health-related quality of residences in counties with and without coal mining Appalachia \\"reported significantly fewer healthy days for both physical and mental health\\". The same study highlights strong correlations between heavy coal mining counties and a greater risk of depression and severe psychological distress. Areas in the Appalachia with coal surface mining exhibit greater rates of adverse health effects and reduced self-rated health in comparison to the national average. In addition, studies from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have concluded a high \\"relationship between surface coal mining jobs and the prevalence of pneumoconiosis\\". Lastly, through examination of mortality rates, county-level poverty rates, and coal mining within counties of the Appalachia, it was identified that coal mining areas of Appalachia experienced higher mortality rates then counties with no coal mining. Environmental impacts Mountaintop removal coal mining in Martin County, Kentucky Coal surface mining has heavily altered the hydrological cycle and landscape of the Appalachia causing environmental degradation and contributing to ecosystem damages beyond repair. Surface coal mining in the Appalachian has contributed to the destruction of over 500 mountain tops. In addition, it has led to the clearance of over 1 million acres of forests and contributed to the degradation or permanent loss of over 12000 miles of streams crucial to the Appalachia watershed from 1985- 2001. Increased salinity and metal contamination of the Appalachian streams have led to toxic effects of fish and bird species. Mountaintop removal, or MTR, is a type of surface mining that has played a major role in negatively impacting the Appalachian environment. When MTR is used, it causes much of the contaminants from the process to be emptied into surrounding valleys which, oftentimes, make their way into nearby streams. These wastes are disposed in \\"valley fills\\" which have collapsed and produced heavy flash floods in Appalachia. The Environmental Protection Agency approximates that between 1985 and 2001, over 700 miles worth of streams in the Appalachians were covered by these \\"valley fills\\" due to mountaintop removal coal mining.  Social and economic impacts  Appalachia has historically been one of the most impoverished regions of the country. There is a debate about whether coal production is a source of wealth or poverty in Appalachia. The U.S. geological survey and the U.S. bureau of mines states that there is a coal-wealth paradox in Appalachia. Appalachia is home to some of the largest coal mines yet the average per capita income is only about 68% of the national per capita income. However, work done by Black and Sanders shows that between 1970 and 1980 the increase in coal production substantially boosted the pay of low skilled workers in Appalachia and likely caused a decrease in income inequality. Although coal mining industries are often associated with increased jobs and economic growth, this association does not hold for Appalachia, where two-thirds of the counties have higher levels of unemployment than the nation and per capita personal wages falling 20% lower than the nation. More specifically, in Hendryx and Zullig's comparative analysis of Appalachia counties, those with coal mining had greater economic disparities and more poverty than those without industry. The shift towards coal surface mining from underground mining led to a 50% decline in mining jobs from 1985 to 2005, and competition from cheap natural gas also decreased demand for coal, leading some mines to close or reduce extraction, which further increased unemployment. From 2014 to 2015, overall mining employment for Appalachia has dropped by 15.9%. A NASA study states that promises of beneficial post-mining development in the Appalachian region have yet to materialize. A 2017 study found that neighborhoods closest to coal impoundments are \\"slightly more likely to have higher rates of poverty and unemployment, even after controlling for rurality, mining-related variables, and spatial dependence\\". Specific events =Buffalo Creek Disaster= In 1972, a slurry pond built by Pittson Coal Company collapsed. In what is known as the Buffalo Creek disaster 130 million gallons of sludge flooded Buffalo Creek. More recently, a waste impoundment owned by Massey burst in Kentucky, flooding nearby streams with 250 tons of coal slurry.  Law and regulation  The Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972 provided payments to coal miners disabled from Coalworker's pneumoconiosis or \\"black lung disease\\" and their dependent survivors. The 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) created two programs: one for regulating active coal mines and a second for reclaiming abandoned mine lands. In the view of Jedediah Purdy, The Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act improved the quality of air and water for much of America, but created \\"sacrificial zones\\" in America, including coal mining communities in Appalachia, that hid the environmental effects of industry and agriculture from people in suburbs but increased exposure to danger for people who lived near sites of pollution. These laws, along with the National Environmental Policy Act form the basis in law for regulation of coal mining, including mountaintop removal mining. Regulations issued on the basis of these laws focus on issuing or withholding permits for new mining operations; the regulations themselves have been contested. , these laws did not take into account direct effects on communities near mines nor economic or racial disparities in those communities, and regulations and executive orders issued that attempted to address such environmental justice concerns had been struck down, and legal challenges based on potential effects on local communities generally failed, since neither the law nor regulations were written to address these concerns and judges ruled based on what the law and regulations actually said. The Affordable Care Act is a federal government health care law; it includes provisions that amend the Black Lung Benefits program. The Black Lung Benefits program details the extent to which coal miners have their medical coverage compensated by the federal government. The ACA provisions that amend the Black Lung Benefits program are commonly known as the Byrd Amendments taking its name from the late West Virginia Congressman Robert Byrd. The Byrd Amendments are found in Section 1556 of the ACA. Among the many protections the Byrd Amendments provides coal miners, it covers medical expenses for coal miners who worked at least 15 years underground (or comparable surface mining) and who have a totally disabling respiratory impairment. Further, it shifts the burden of proof of disability due to \\"black lung disease\\" from these coal miners back to the coal companies. Coalworker's pneumoconiosis or \\"black lung disease\\" can be a common health problem faced by retired coal miners. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 Early attempts to regulate strip-mining on the state level were largely unsuccessful due to lax enforcement. The Appalachian Group to Save the Land and the People was founded in 1965 to stop surface mining. In 1968, Congress held the first hearings on strip mining. Ken Hechler introduced the first strip-mining abolition bill in Congress in 1971. Though this bill was not passed, provisions establishing a process to reclaim abandoned strip mines and allowing citizens to sue regulatory agencies became parts of SMCRA. SMCRA also created the Office of Surface Mining, an agency within the Department of the Interior, to promulgate regulations, to fund state regulatory and reclamation efforts, and to ensure consistency among state regulatory programs. Advocacy groups The study of justice has often been defined by the theories of John Rawls. Justice theory has focused on the principles by the which to distribute goods in a society. The defining arguments of the environmental justice movement were about patterns that violated some of these distributive principles of justice theory. Several contemporary scholars have developed theories of justice that are broader then the distributional theory of justice. The study of justice theory, as applied to the environmental justice, has primarily focused on \\"maldistribution\\". In other words, this area of study has concentrated on the fact that poor communities, indigenous communities and communities of color are often disproportionately impacted by environmentally-related negative externalities and receive less environmental protection. Environmental justice has been identified by scholars as a movement that acknowledged the disproportionate effects of environmental damage and toxic contamination on the poor and people of color. It has also been noted that the race and class of the parties effects the community's chances of success in enacting reforms. Environmental justice groups were community grassroots organizations that combined environmentalism with issues of race a class equality. These groups organized in opposition to the disproportionate threat mountain communities faced from health hazards like acid mine drainage. Save Our Cumberland Mountains Save Our Cumberland Mountains (SOCM, pronounced \\"sock 'em\\") was founded when thirteen residents of the Tennessee coalfields petitioned their state government to make coal landholders pay a fair share of taxes. SOCM later grew into one of most significant community organizations in the region and went on to lead a major legislative campaign against employers who replaced their permanent employees with long-term temporary workers. J.W. Bradley was the president of SOCM for its first five years. He had worked in the deep mines and was outspoken about what he called the \\"evils of strip mining.\\" He believed in using litigation to pursue reform. In 1974, SOCM established the East Tennessee Research Corporation as a public interest law firm. By 1976, SOCM was trying to ban strip mining and targeting individual strip mining operations. An attorney who worked with SOCM in the 1970s has written that very few people of color were involved with SOCM in the early years. He highlights the importance of regional organizations like the Highlander Research and Education Center that \\"seek to bring together diverse communities to share their knowledge about the inner dynamics of environmental justice issues\\". Mountain Justice Mountain Justice began in 2005 as a summer-long campaign for the abolition of MTM.It has since grown into an activist network that spans rural coalfields, college campuses and urban activists. The organization was started after a 2004 mining accident in Virginia. A three year old was killed when a boulder rolled off a MTM site above his home. The first MJ meeting took place in Knoxville, Tennessee and included activists from Coal River Mountain Watch (CRMW), the Sierra Club, Appalachian Voices, and Katuah Earth First (KEF!). Their mission statement includes a commitment to non-violence.

It protects a marine area off the coast of the state, and was the first such park to be created by São Paulo. It includes a rocky islet, tidal reefs and surrounding waters, with various areas suitable for diving, including a boat that was deliberately wrecked to form an artificial reef. The combination of warm surface waters and cold deeper waters supports a high level of biodiversity. Location The Laje de Santos Marine State Park is in the municipality of Santos, São Paulo. The park covers a marine rectangle that contains the Laje de Santos island and the Bandolim, Brilhante and Sul e Novo rocks and reefs. It is 16.8 nautical miles from the Moela Island Lighthouse on the mainland. The Laje de Santos is an island formed by the top of a mostly submerged granite mountain 22 nautical miles from the coast. The island is , and is high. The greatest depth in the surrounding sea is . History The Laje de Santos Marine State Park was created by state governor Luís Antônio Fleury Filho by decree 37.537 of 27 September 1993. It aims to fully protect the flora, fauna, scenic beauty and natural, marine and terrestrial ecosystems. It is the first marine park created by the state. At first nothing was done to impose the total ban on fishing within the park, which existed only on paper. After 2003 a change in government policy has improved protection, as has an active NGO that is dedicated to protection of the park. Volunteers and paid staff now have boats and equipment to patrol the boundaries. The park administration is under the Forest Foundation, a unit of the Environment Secretariat of the State of São Paulo. Environment The park contains the uninhabited Laje de Santos islet and several rocky reefs separated by extensive areas of sand, with a maximum depth of about . It is in the transition between tropical and sub-tropical environments, and is a high latitude \\"marginal\\" reef site. The granite rocks below the low tide level are mostly covered in patches of brown and red algae, Palythoa caribaeorum, hydrozoa, ascidiacea and octocorallia. The bedrock also holds sparse, isolated colonies of the Madracis decactis and Mussismilia hispida scleractinia. The prevailing Brazil Current brings warm surface waters from the north, supporting a local reef fish population that is closer to the fauna of the tropical Western Atlantic and Northeastern Brazilian coast than the fauna of southern temperate reefs. A seasonal upwelling brings colder waters of up from the shelf slope to the deepest areas of the reef, where temperate species are found. The result is a fauna that ranges from that of tropical regions to subtropical endemics and species found as far south as Patagonia. 196 reef fish species have been recorded, in 124 genera and 66 families. The families with the most species were Carangidae (16), Grouper (12), Wrasse (10), Pomacentridae (8) and Parrotfish (8). Abundant fish species include the tomtate grunt (Haemulon aurolineatum), sergeant major (Abudefduf saxatilis), brown chromis (Chromis multilineata), dusky damselfish (Stegastes fuscus), jubauna reeffish (Chromis jubauna), silver porgy (Diplodus argenteus), porkfish (Anisotremus virginicus) and ringneck blenny (Parablennius pilicornis). The park is on the migratory route of the giant manta rays of the Brazilian coast, which visit in the autumn and winter. Visiting School of yellowstripe grunt (Haemulon chrysargyreum) Public use is allowed under park rules that ensure conservation and appreciation of the local ecosystems. Scuba diving and boating are allowed in the park. Boats are no longer allowed to anchor, but diving boats may use mooring buoys. Visitors may not capture or collect any marine or terrestrial organism, except where permitted for scientific research, must not land on the island or reefs without prior authorization, and must refrain from any activities that cause physical damage or pollution. Diving areas include Portinho on the sheltered north coast of the Laje, a smooth rocky slope that presents little difficulty to the diver. It is inhabited by many benthic fish and invertebrates, and sea turtles are often present. The Boca da Baleia (Whale's Mouth) is a rock formation on the south side of the Laje de Santos where many fish and turtles are found, with a depth of up to . The Ponta Leste (East Point) of the Laje de Santos descends to . Halfway down it is common to see southern stingray, large groupers, Atlantic wreckfish and even Atlantic goliath groupers. Nearer the surface there are always many turtles and assorted shoals of fish. The Naufrágio do Moréia (Moray Wreck) is a deliberately wrecked iron fishing boat that was sunk in 1995 to create an artificial reef. The boat is disintegrating, so should not be entered. It is home to invertebrates such as anemones and gorgonians, crustaceans, groupers, sargos, white grunt (Haemulon plumierii) and salema porgys.

Jewish Encyclopedia This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Zechariah, and is a part of the Book of the Twelve Minor Prophets. The chapter contains the vision of Joshua, the high priest, being cleansed before God. It is a part of a section (so-called \\"First Zechariah\\") consisting of Zechariah 1–8. Text The original text was written in the Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 10 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Codex Cairensis (from year 895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), and Codex Leningradensis (1008).

His subsequent \\"cleansing\\" gives the sign that God will forgive and cleanse the community, signified by the renewal of the temple services. Vision of the High Priest (3:1–5) In the fourth of the eight visions, the prophets sees a real person, the high priest Joshua, instead of symbolic objects like in other visions. The replacement of Joshua's \\"filthy clothes\\" (verses 3–4) with new apparel gives the legitimation of the new temple and priesthood. The Coming Branch (3:6–10) The resumption of the temple worship will lead to the coming of \\"the Branch\\" (verse 8), who will restore the kingship into a new era (verse 10), when the iniquity of the land will be cleansed in one day (verse 9).

He is the writer of an English-language blog, The Sudanese Thinker. Early life and education Born in Khartoum, Nasr was raised in Qatar and Malaysia. Raised by parents who were not particularly pious Muslims, he began his education at Islamic schools in Qatar and Kuala Lumpur, where the focus was on memorizing the Koran. He learned “that Jews drink the blood of children and conspire against Islam” and was taught “prayers calling for the destruction of the Jews.” He also learned English. Nasr became more and more devout as a result of his teachers' influence, but later, as a teenager in Kuala Lumpur, he encountered young liberal-minded Muslims online and in person and began to question his faith. He started his own blog, on which he recorded his shifting religious views. He is currently pursuing a master’s in philosophy and researching the effect of new media on Islamic thought today. Career Nasr began writing his blog in 2006 because he felt that not enough Sudanese citizens were speaking out about Darfur. His blog helped encourage other people in Sudan to start English-language blogs. It also became a significance source of information for foreign journalists and audiences. Originally, Nasr's blog was anonymous, but in 2011, during the Arab Spring, he revealed his identity. Since then he has become an author, activist, social entrepreneur, and human-rights advocate. My Isl@m: How Fundamentalism Stole My Mind – And Doubt Freed My Soul In 2013, he published his first book, My Isl@m: How Fundamentalism Stole My Mind—And Doubt Freed My Soul. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly praised the book for “seamlessly blend[ing] memoir with political thought and activism.” Author Clay Shirky has described the book as “a love letter to freedom of speech.” Another author, Ken Wilber, called it “an important and significant book.” Other writings In a June 2011 article for the Guardian, he wrote that the secession of what is now South Sudan would not end Sudan's “Afro-Arab identity crisis” or “magically turn the country into a genuinely Arab Islamic nation-state despite what Omar al-Bashir may want.” On the contrary, he wrote, “Sudan always has been and always will be a multi-ethnic, multi-religious melting pot.” In January 2012, he wrote an article for Al Jazeera, titled \\"Reviving the \\"New Sudan vision. The article is about John Garang, the Southern Sudanese Christian rebel turned-statesmen. In June 2012, he wrote an article for Foreign Policy entitled “Sudan Needs a Revolution.” He suggested that the tide was “shifting against Bashir,” and that “most Sudanese citizens aren’t yearning for more Islamism, but are instead focusing on and demanding better economic conditions, transparency, and accountability.” While “this battle will ultimately be fought and won by Sudanese, the international community also has an important role to play.” Other professional activities Nasr is a contributor to Global Voices Online. He organized The Future of Islam In the Age of New Media, an online audio seminar featuring 60 speakers. He is also a Havel Prize Committee member, helping to determine the winners of the Václav Havel International Prize for Creative Dissent for The Human Rights Foundation.

The series debuted on July 28, 2014. It is currently hosted and written by Jesse Alexander, a Canadian historian. It has been previously hosted by American historian and actor Indiana Neidell. The channel produces weekly content that follows the events that occurred one hundred years prior during the war. After the centennial's conclusion, Indiana Neidell, the first host and writer of the series, left the project and now presents the World War Two channel.https://blog.patreon.com/creative-freedom-time-ghost Jesse Alexander was picked to replace Neidell. It currently focuses on World War I's aftermath, abandoning the week-by-week format and focusing on longer, more in- depth documentaries about events that followed it, such as the German Revolution and the Russian Civil War.  Premise The Great War channel produces a number of different types of content, the main feature being a weekly recap of the war that corresponds to the events of the same week 100 years prior. The events presented are also summarized quarterly in their own videos. The channel also presents other segments such as: * \\"Out of the Trenches\\" - an informative segment in which the host answers questions asked by subscribers on a wide range of topics. * \\"Who Did What in World War I?\\" - a biographical segment that focuses on the actions of famous individuals during the First World War. * \\"Countries in World War I\\" - A segment that gives a summary of the situation of individual countries just before and during the war. * Technology and Warfare in World War I - Experts inspect and discuss weapons and tools from the war. * World War I Essential Knowledge - A segment which is designed to provide background information on the war, such as tactics and politics. * Visits to significant European sites of the war, including Verdun and Przemyśl fortress. From 2019/1919, Out of the Trenches was renamed Beyond the Great War. Although it is only one episode per month, it is longer than the old 10 minutes Out of the Trenches.  History  Indiana Neidell and the producers of the channel tried a number of different show formats with only The Great War surviving. Mediakraft Networks, the production company of The Great War, originally planned to launch as well German, Polish and Turkish language versions of the show. However, unlike the English channel, these ambiguous projects did not prove to have a chance to recoup their costs. This quickly led to the termination of the Polish channel. On August 17, 2015, the German series ended its run after a total of 102 episodes. The English channel continued substantially due to support by crowdfunding. The show got a big boost in viewership when the Battlefield 1 first-person shooter video game developed by EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on October 21, 2016. Neidell, with research assistant Markus Linke, also contributed research and wrote in-game codex entries for Battlefield 1 and named the \\"medals\\" that serve as the game's achievement trophies. The channel has been in operation since May 2014. It continued to produce its regular content, involving the war's centennial, until December 2018. In early 2019, the channel started to produce longer in-depth episodes under a new host, Jesse Alexander, who replaced Neidell as he moved on to other projects such as World War Two.

Plecanatide is an agonist of guanylate cyclase-C. Plecanatide increases intestinal transit and fluid through a buildup of cGMP. Medical uses As of January 2017, plecanatide is approved in the United States for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults. The presence of this condition is determined using the Rome III diagnostic criteria for chronic constipation which requires that the patient meet stool frequency, stool consistency, incomplete evacuation, and straining requirements in addition to not being a likely candidate for irritable bowel syndrome. The symptoms should also have been present for at least three of the last six months to establish the chronic nature of the condition before treatment with plecanatide is indicated. Plecanatide has been shown to be safe and effective. It has shown to be at least equally as effective as its main competitor, linaclotide (brand name Linzess), but has been shown to have a lower rate of diarrhea as an adverse drug reaction.  Contraindications  Plecanatide has not been shown to be safe or effective in persons 6 years to 18 years of age. Use of plecanatide by persons under the age of 6 poses a serious dehydration risk and studies have demonstrated plecanatide can cause death in juvenile mice due to this dehydrating effect. Use of plecanatide is also contraindicated in persons who are suspected of having a mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction.  Pharmacology   Structure and function  Plecanatide is a 16 amino acid peptide with the amino acid sequence: H-Asn1-Asp2-Glu3-Cys4-Glu5-Leu6-Cys7-Val8-Asn9-Val10-Ala11-Cys12-Thr13-Gly14-Cys15-Leu16-OH Is nearly structurally identical to human uroguanylin, apart from the substitution of Asp3 with Glu3. Disulfide bonds exist between Cys4 and Cys12, as well as Cys7 and Cys15. Plecanatide has two important motifs. The first being the acidic residues Asp2 and Glu3 which modulate the affinity for its receptor in response to environmental pH. Simulations predict the optimal activity of Plecanatide to occur at pH 5, making it suitable for targeting cells within the proximal intestine, which has a pH of between 5 and 6. The second is the ACTGC motif (residues Ala11 to Cys15) which is the region responsible for its binding to the receptor, guanylate cyclase-C.  Mechanism of action  Plecanatide works as a laxative by drawing water in to the gastrointestinal tract thereby softening stool and encouraging its natural passage. Similar to its endogenous counterpart, plecanatide activates guanylate cyclase-C on endothelial cells within the gastrointestinal tract. The activation of guanylate cyclase-C catalyses the production of the second messenger guanosine 3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) which leads to the protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase G II (PKGII)-mediated phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR is an anion channel and upon activation it will secrete negatively charged ions, particularly chloride (Cl−) and bicarbonate (HCO3−) in to the GI tract lumen. This disruption to the electrochemical gradient is in part rectified by the passive secretion of positively charged sodium ions in to the lumen and water follows by osmosis. Plecanatide is also known to have an anti-nociceptive effect in animal models, however the exact mechanism of action is not yet fully elucidated. It has been suggested that this may be in part to the anti-inflammatory action of guanylate cyclase-C by its inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or through the inhibition of associated sensory neurons.  Pharmacokinetics and metabolism  As plecanatide acts on receptors present on the apical side of endothelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract it is able to impart its effect without ever entering circulation. As with most orally ingested peptides, plecanatide is degraded by intestinal enzymes, and so very little of the active drug enters systemic circulation. Minimal amounts of the drug are expected to be transported in to the body, and concentrations of plecanatide and its metabolites are undetectable in plasma following the recommended dosage of 3 mg. It has also been shown that dosages up to 48.6 mg produced no detectable concentration of plecanatide in human plasma at any time point after ingestion.  Commercialization  Plecanatide, branded as Trulance, is manufactured by Synergy Pharmaceuticals.

He was the bishop of Beth Arsham (House of Arsames), which was located near Seleucia-Ctesiphon. Life Simeon was known as an eloquent and passionate disputant, and devoted to his Orthodox faith. He used to argue with Nestorians, Manicheans, Eutychians and the doctrines of Marcion of Sinope and Bardaisan in which he earned the title 'The Persian Disputant'. He spent most of his life in Mesopotamia and Persia preaching Christianity, where many pagan Arabs, dignitaries of Persian Zoroastrianism and Magians were baptized by him. Three baptized Magi were denounced by the king Kavadh I and their former colleagues, they were found dead ten days after their baptism. According to John of Ephesus, Simeon was threatened with death and had to grow his hair and beard to go unnoticed. An alliance broke out between the Nestorian Church and the Persian monarchy, the Nestorians presented themselves as the national Christian church and denounced their opponents as a \\"fifth column\\" of the Byzantine Empire. Simeon then made his first journey to Constantinople, and obtained a letter from the emperor Anastasius to be delivered to the king of the Persians, where he begged him not to take sides in the quarrels between the Christians of his state. At a time when Simeon was staying in al-Hira, the Catholicos Nestorian Babai wrote to five monophysite bishops inviting them to a conference. The latter sent for Simeon, the celebrated debater, and the Nestorians were in great distress when they saw him arriving with the bishops. This symposium, which occupies an important place in the text of John of Ephesus, apparently held in Arzun near Siirt in the Province of Nisibis (Arbayistan), at least in the presence of the Marzban, the provincial governor of the Persian frontier, who was to serve as an arbiter. According to the Monophysite writer, the debate ended, of course, with Simeon's undisputed triumph, which was \\"on this occasion\\" (thus under the pontificate of Babai) promoted to be the Bishop of Beth Arsham to the dissident church located on the Tigris near Seleucia-Ctesiphon shortly before 503. Simeon nevertheless pursued his itinerant preaching in the Persian kingdom. But some time later, at the urging of the Nestorian hierarchy by John of Ephesus, King Kavadh first ordered the arrest of all the bishops and archimandrites Monophysites and was imprisoned in Nisibis for seven years. After his release, he continued traveling in which he visited Constantinople. Later on, the emperor Anastasius chose him to be a delegate to the Persian King Kavadh, to discuss easing the restrictions on Christians. In 526 a war between Byzantine Empire and the Sassanid Empire began, and the king of the Lakhmids \\"Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man\\" attacked Syria. Two high-ranking Byzantine commanders were captured, Timostratus and John. This caused Justinian I to send al-Mundhir an embassy to Al-Hira for peace consisting of Abraham son of Euphrasius (his son is Nonnosus the historian) and Simeon of Beth Arsham. Simeon's last journey was to meet the empress Theodora in Constantinople, where he died around 540.Simon of Beth Arsham (d. 540) Letters In a letter concerning the heresy of the Nestorians, and the Catholicos Babai, Bishop Simeon writes:The historian and Bishop Simeon of Beth Arsham Then, he traveled to Najran to interview eyewitnesses, and write a report about the massacre of Christians perpetrated by the Jewish Himyarite \\"Dhu Nuwas\\" on 25 November 523.

She was launched in 1781 and had an uneventful career until the Navy sold her in 1802. Private interests purchased her, lengthened her, and changed her rig to that of a brig. They hired her out to the Navy and she was in service as a hired armed brig from 1806 to 1808. She then returned to mercantile service until she was condemned at Lisbon in May 1816 as not worth repairing. Royal Navy cutter The Navy commissioned Cockatrice for home waters in August 1781. In August 1782 she was under the command of Lieutenant C. Bartholomew, in home waters. She was paid off in 1782 or 1783. She was then recommissioned in May 1783 under the command of Lieutenant William Reynolds off the Isle of Wight. She was paid off in 1786 but in October she was recommissioned under the command of Lieutenant C. Hummer. She was again paid off in 1789. From 1790 to 1793, Lieutenant Walter Locke commanded Cockatrice in the Channel.Marshall (1823), Vol. 1, Part. 2, p.678.

In February 1793 Lieutenant John Clements took command. On 9 March Cockatrice sent a Dutch hoy, of about 200 tons, into Poole. The hoy had been sailing from Genoa to Havre. Cockatrice also sent into Portsmouth a French brig carrying wine and salt.Lloyd's List №2491. Disposal: The Navy paid her off in April 1793 and placed her in ordinary at Portsmouth. She sat there until she sank at her moorings in 1801. The Navy refloated her. Then the \\"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\\" offered \\"Cockatrice Cutter, 181 Tons, Copper-bottomed, lying at Portsmouth\\", for sale on 9 September 1802. Hired armed vessel Private interests purchased her, increased her burthen from 181 to 195 tons by cutting her in half and lengthening her, and changed her rig to that of a brig. The Admiralty hired her and she commenced service as His Majesty's hired brig (HMhb) Cockatrice on 6 August 1804. In 1804 she was under the command of Lieutenant Nicholas Kemp (or Kempe) when on 18 June she came into Portsmouth with a convoy from the Downs, and on 22 June sailed with a convoy for the westward.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, pp.163-4. On 2 October she escorted the recaptured West Indiaman into Liverpool. Later, on 10 January 1805, Cockatrice recaptured the brig Padgey. Padgey had been sailing from Cardiff to London when a privateer captured her near Land's End. Cockatrice sent her into Penzance.Lloyd's List №4183. On 20 February Kempe and Cockatrice detained Flora. Flora, Klyn, master, had been sailing from Bilboa to Embden when Cockatrice intercepted her and sent her into the Motherbank.Lloyd's List №4195. In 1806 Cockatrice was under the command of P. Greene. According to Ccckatrices log book, Greene was Pitt Burnaby Greene, and he took command on 6 April 1805. During his tenure Cockatrice patrolled and escorted convoys, but did not capture any prizes. On 30 March 1806, Burnaby Greene was off Ireland with orders to take on board the Earl of Hardwicke, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1801-1805). Burnaby Greene left Cockatrice in February 1807, moving to take command of .MANUSCRIPT LOGS of BRIG-SLOOP HMS \\"FOXHOUND\\" \\"COCKATRICE\\", COMMANDED BY PITT BURNANBY-GREENE. In 1807 J. B. Balderston took command of Cockatrice. On 27 and 28 August in the run-up to the British attack on Copenhagen the Royal Navy embargoed three Danish vessels then at Plymouth: Elizabeth, Tiesco, and Aurora. Also on 28 August Cockatrice and were in company at the capture of the Danish ship Speculaton and so shared in the prize money for her. Two days later and Cockatrice were in company for the detention of the Danish ship George, and the Danish vessels Die Perle and Fortuna. In 1808 William Balfour replaced Balderston. He wrote to his uncle and some of his letters were later published. He described her as a leaky and that she should be taken out of service. He reported that the owners had hired her out for 15s/month/ton (or £1795 per annum, based on a burthen of 195 tons). The owners also had agreed to provide 45 men at a rate of £5 10s each, per month. However, Balfour further reported that the owners were rarely able to provide half that many. At the time of writing, Cockatrice had a crew of 30 including Balfour and his servant. Lastly, Balfour reported that it was his understanding that Balderston had, in his 16 months in command, amassed some £2000 in prize money. Cockatrices contract ended in 1808. There is no readily available record of her having taken any prizes during Balfour's term in command.

He holds concurrent academic advisory positions in China (Peking University) and Thailand (Chulalongkorn University) as well as the University of Washington (Human Interface Technology Laboratory) in Seattle.HITLab in the University of Washington He has influenced three fields: corporate social responsibility, \\"closing the Digital Divide,\\" and \\"mindful technologies,\\" Mindfultech Retrieved from Facebook blog in which technologies are designed to further mindfulness and achieve ethical impacts on citizens. Early life and education Raised in a family of weekly newspaper publishers in idyllic Whidbey Island, Washington, Craig Smith was inculcated by his parents with the values of “civic journalism,\\" by which communications becomes the basis for grassroots civic harmony – a constant principle through his life. Graduating cum laude from Stanford University, he became exposed to mentors and intellectual innovators, such as Kenneth E. Boulding (2010-2013), for whom Smith served as a research assistant. Boulding is famous for introducing a concept called \\"general systems theory,\\" in which single ideas could have a transformational impact on whole organizational systems. One such transformational idea was that economic instruments, e.g. the field of philanthropy, could be used to systematically produce \\"betterment\\" in society.The Economy of Love of Fear by Kenneth Boulding Crossroads, Vol. 5, No. 3, pp. 109-118, 2005 To Boulding the most significant of these instruments was \\"philanthropy.\\" Under Boulding's influence, Smith dedicated his career to the challenge of using economic tools to generate reforms within the field of philanthropy. Philanthropy Boulding encouraged Smith to take on his first professional job, in the Washington DC-based trade association, called Council on Foundations, where he became a frequent writer for the trade journal, Foundation News. He co-authored Private Foreign Aid: The Private Role in International DevelopmentR. Bolling & Smith, Craig. W. \\"Private Foreign Aid: United States Philanthropy in Relief and Development,\\". (May 30, 1982) and Getting Grants, published by Harper and Row. Dissatisfied with the quality of current practice regarding the philanthropic role of corporations, Smith founded his own publishing company called Corporate Philanthropy Report. With this publication as his platform, Smith's views on the corporate role in society were frequently quoted in Wall Street Journal and became the basis for opinion/editorial articles in New York Times. Smith's most impactful publication, was an article in Harvard Business Review, called \\"The New Corporate Philanthropy,\\" published in 2004. The article, which for the first time explained the optimal role that could be played by philanthropy in the management structures of Fortune 500 companies. The article influenced Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter, to formulate the field of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Meanwhile, Japanese corporations turned to Smith to introduce philanthropy to Japanese corporations which had a Japanese version published by Dentsu Inc. Smith authored of several books on Japanese corporate philanthropy,https://doublethedonation.com/corporate-philanthropy- examples-10-leaders/ and traveled frequently travelled to Japan as a consultant where he helped companies such as Hitachi and Toyota create their own foundations. As a Seattle-based expert in corporate philanthropy, Smith advised many of Seattle’s civic leaders including the father and mother of Bill Gates III (co-founder of Microsoft), who were both influential civic leaders and advocates of philanthropy, who introduced Smith to their son. After reading his article in Harvard Business Review, the Microsoft CEO invited Smith to serve as an in house consultant to help to transform the company's \\"community relations\\" activity. Smith's work at Microsoft, lasting two years, led Microsoft to create the world's largest and arguably the most respected corporate philanthropy program, and led to the framework adopted by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It led Smith to identify the specific management innovations needed for technology companies to bring the internet into remote corners of the planet. Noting Smith's leadership role on this issue, a business trade group, the Conference Board, asked Smith to head a new program in CSR Strategy offered to all major US corporations.Looking Good Doing Good: Corporate Philanthropy and Corporate Power (page: 158) Digital Divide His experience at Microsoft, which established Microsoft’s posture on the theme of “closing the Digital Divide,” established Smith as an intellectual leader on the digital-divide theme. He advised many other companies on this topic as well, and wrote a book Digital Corporate Citizenship (University of Indiana Press), which described efforts by 54 high tech companies – from IBM to Google—to alter their management structured with the aim of “closing Digital Divide.” In 1999 Smith joined with Bill Gates Sr, to lead a Seattle conference held on the day prior to World Trade Organization’s conference. That event, which linked Silicon Valley billionaires with leaders of the United Nations and World Bank, established the digital-divide theme as an enduring international movement. Among participants at his 1999 conference were two influential academics, Jeffrey Sachs, a professor at Harvard and Nicholas Negroponte, of MIT Media Lab. After the conference, Smith moved from Seattle to Cambridge Mass to lead an interdisciplinary coalition focused on closing digital divide. In Cambridge, his framework was incorporated into DigitalDivide.org. After serving as a fellow of Harvard's Fairbank Center for China Studies, Smith was also invited many times to China to advise the Chinese government on its plan to extend broadband technology to its impoverished Western provinces. Smith lectured at several China-funded government forums, which resulting in his being invited to establish a three-year program on digital divide at the Department of Information Management of Peking University, China's top ranked university. As the focus of the Digital Divide movement shifted to Asia, Prof Smith was invited to teach science and technology policy in Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at National University of Singapore.Against the Digital Divide with DDI published on the web Tekno Preneur That role created a platform that led him to advise government ministers in India, Indonesia, China, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Thailand on the framework for closing Digital Divide. In Asia, Smith developed a decade-long partnership with Ilham A HabibieIlham A Habibie \\"Meaningful Broadband for Indonesia: A Strategic Tool for a National Development\\". the son of a former President of Republic of Indonesia, whose father was the science and technology minister for 15 years. With Habibie's support, Smith gained political traction and funding needed to formulate the model of \\"Meaningful Broadband.\\" Incorporating a technical team from The World Bank, Smith wrote a number of reports that produced a road map for the implementation of Meaningful Broadband Meaningful Broadband Model: Fast Internet as platform for economic reform as a \\"bottom up\\" approach to socio-economic, cultural and environmental development in Indonesian regions. Mindful Technologies Behind the macroeconomic and political factors of the Digital Divide issue, was a fundamental human factor: the role of digital technology for human development. Inspired by the legacy of the Xerox PARC laboratory near Stanford, Smith understood that the fundamental purpose of digital technology was not to expand markets but to elicit human potential.Beyond the MDGs: Technology, Finance and Statistics to Unlock Sustainable Development in Asia- Pacific retrieved from Asian Development Bank Forum web\\"Xerox PARC's chief technologist, Mark Weiser, before his death in 1983, led a design movement that claimed that the real purpose of Digital Technology is to create new human/computer interfaces that distribute the users’ attention throughout their whole bodies (not just become concentrated in cognitive faculties) while at the same time establishing total ubiquitous interaction between humans and their natural environments. Smith understood that, since his death, Weiser's vision had been compromised by the materialistic forces of Silicon Valley. Nonetheless, Smith asserted that conditions have emerged that could enable next-generation technologies – artificial intelligence, wearable devices, biosensors and virtual/augmented reality platforms – to be altered in a way that could finally realize Weiser's vision. Thus, Smith began to see his role as helping to align technology design with mindfulness. Since 1996, when he was a founding faculty member of Naropa University, Smith had maintained a parallel voluntary career as a mindfulness instructor in affiliates of Shambhala International, founded by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche. Noting that applications of mindfulness could have a transformational effect on fields of education and health care, Prof Smith introduced the theme of \\"spiritual computing\\" at University of Washington, Microsoft, IBM Labs and Google in 2006, when he became Senior Adviser to the Human Interface Technology Laboratory The IT Diaspora Factor and Democracy 2.0 (14 Feb 2011) led by Thomas A.

In the 2017 elections, he was elected as a member of La République En Marche! to the French National Assembly, representing the department of Haute-Garonne's 10th constituency. In December 2018, he was excluded from LREM for having voted against the 2019 draft budget. In May 2020, he was one of the 17 initial members of the new Ecology Democracy Solidarity group in the National Assembly. Nadot was an associate professor of physical education and sports, also a doctor of history. He was an associate member of the EESC (Economic, Social and Environmental Council), employment and labor section, from December 2015 to 18 June 2017. He is a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of La Francophonie. Sitting on the Foreign Affairs Committee, after officially calling on the government in a written question, he is against the sale of French weapons used by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to bomb the civilian population of Yemen on a daily basis. In an interview given on the program \\"Quotidien\\" of 23 February 2018 presented by Yann Barthès he clearly asks to suspend arms sales to Arab states of the Persian Gulf that use it on civilian populations, in line with a resolution of the European Parliament. On 6 April 2018 he filed a request for the opening of a commission of inquiry to the National Assembly on the respect of France's international commitments with regard to arms export licenses in Yemen. He is also very involved on the issue of human rights in Cameroon, stressing the risks of an eruption of violence in the English-speaking area which is reminiscent of the process that led to the genocide in Rwanda.  Academic career  Nadot has taught at various secondary and university educational institutions and Apprenticeship Training Center (Mantes-la-Jolie, Orleans, Bourges, Nice, Toulouse, several institutions of Haute-Garonne). Holder of a PhD in history and civilizations from EHESS Paris (2009), he also taught history at the University of Orleans (1998-2003) and the University of Nice (2005-2008). In 2015/2016, he follows a preparation at ENA in continuing education at the Institute of Political Studies of Toulouse. His academic work focuses on the history of the body, physical practices and education. His thesis and his recent work make it possible to approach sport in its anthropological continuum, from ancient Greece and its Olympic Games, to the present day. The contours of the current sport and their complexity would be largely related to the strong relationship of corporal practices with the media. In contrast to the work of Norbert Elias, who links the birth of sport to a lowering of the degree of violence in practice and to the advent of a specific ethic, his theory is not contrary to certain ideas of Pierre de Coubertin who wrote about the medieval knight that \\"The sporting passion takes hold of him, lifts him up and, through him and through him, will spread throughout all of Western Europe from Germany, Spain, from Italy to England, France serving as a central hub for movement \\" Inspired by the ideas of Georges Duby and Eric Hobsbawm, his work also focuses on the relationship between men and their territories and on the notion of human networks through the example of the orders of chivalry or the heralds of arms: the construction of a sporting code of conduct predates the eighteenth century. In his thesis titled Jousts, Roots and No Weapons in Castile, Burgundy and France (1428-1470), Sébastien Nadot shows that sport already existed in the fifteenth century and that, therefore, sport was not born in France. 19th century in England within the bourgeoisie. This historical vision opens a breach in a building built on the basis of the work of Norbert Elias. In addition to this contribution in break with the widespread doxa (see on this subject the works of synthesis of Georges Vigarello), it also showed that the organization of the chivalry around European contests works like a system in elaborate network. Sébastien Nadot evokes an \\"International chivalrous\\", sharing the same codes, especially at the approach of tournaments and games. These sporting events go beyond the borders and are accompanied by a common cultural base, in which are courtesy, fair play, honor and loyalty. Part of the thesis attempts to demonstrate that medieval sports events are first-class communication media, prefiguration of the modern Olympic Games. Political, diplomatic and financial issues are emerging behind the greatest medieval spectacle. Specialist games, Sébastien Nadot is more interested in the sporting phenomenon, the notion of conflict (physical or verbal) and also the \\"revival\\" of the Middle Ages in the twenty-first century. His work on chivalric orders, knightly journeys and heralds of arms also led to a reflection on medieval social networks. On the other hand, if sport was not born with the British industrial revolution within the bourgeoisie, it calls into question its \\"capitalist\\" essence and questions its nature as a terrain of ideological struggles. Starting from the results of his investigation of medieval chivalric combats, Sébastien Nadot proposes a new theory of the evolution of sport. In each era, the ruling class would try through sport to impose on others its values and beyond, its superiority. Sport is therefore today the expression of neo-conservative liberalism. The idea of its birth in the early nineteenth century would be the expression of the new domination of the bourgeoisie. The belief in the birth of sport ex-nihilo in England at this time would be a confusion with a process of increased democratization, especially in its gradual opening to women. These works are to be placed in a wider debate: the dedicated authors of the history of sport (Norbert Elias, Allen Guttmann) consider that modern sport emerges only at the turn of the eighteenth century and nineteenth century, the specialists of medieval and modern periods claiming the right to use this concept, even though many of the criteria of modern sport do not end up before the nineteenth century. Political career Citizen candidate for the 2017 presidential election supported by the Progressists Movement, which promotes a new democratic dynamic around three pillars: social progress that benefits all, the environmental filter posed prior to any public decision and the participation of citizens decision-making phases of political action. He says he wants to erase the line between the political elite and the citizens. His candidacy was initially to be inserted in the primary citizen of 2017 but the first secretary of the PS Jean-Christophe Cambadélis withdrew it. To block François Fillon and Marine Le Pen, he made a call to the gathering of \\"progressive forces\\" for the presidential election addressed to Emmanuel Macron, Jean-Luc Melenchon, Charlotte Marchandise and Yannick Jadot. He is the first French politician to have used an augmented reality campaign poster. In January 2017, Nadot published a political tale titled Reinette 2.0. In this novel, he discusses the relationship between democracy, the Internet and social networks. In February 2017, faced with the difficulty of collecting the 500 sponsorships needed to run for the presidential election, he announced his withdrawal, to support Emmanuel Macron personally and joined the political council of En marche! Nadot was selected by En marche! to be their candidate in the legislative elections on the 10th district of Haute-Garonne. He was elected with 60.7% of the votes int the second round. In parliament, he serves on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In addition to his committee assignments, he chairs the France - Québec Parliamentary Friendship Group. In 2018, Nadot and 15 other co-signatories officially filed a request for a commission of inquiry into the legality of French weapons sales to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, days before an official visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Paris.John Irish and Marine Pennetier (5 April 2018), Ahead of Saudi prince visit, Macron lawmaker asks for inquiry over French arms sales Reuters.

His name is associated with the grand palace and grounds in Guzów in Masovia, Poland. Background Sobański's mother, Róża, Siberian Rose He was born into a Polish family of magnates. He was the youngest of four and the only son of Ludwik Sobański (1791-1837) and his wife, Róża, née Łubieńska, daughter of Feliks Lubienski and Tekla Teresa Lubienska. His father fell foul of the Russian authorities due to his dissident stance and was sentenced to years of exile in Siberia. His mother, at great personal risk, went to persistent lengths to aid her husband and others similarly banished. She used official means to bring them practical relief sending food parcels and correspondence. When the Russians cut off these supplies, she took to more clandestine methods. This earned her the sobriquet, Siberian Rose. Ludwik Sobański's ordeals affected his health; he died at 46 years of age when Feliks was barely four.http://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/ludwik- sobanskihttp://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/roza-rozalia-sobanska-z- lubienskich Feliks' eldest surviving sister, Paulina (b.1824), married Adolf Jełowicki (1809-1891), veteran officer of the November Uprising in Podolia.Borkowski, Genealogie; Drzewo genealogiczne 64-herbowe po mieczu i kądzieli Sobańskich, Łubieńskich, Jełowickich, Drohojowskich, W. 1912 s. 9–10, 47–8. Sobański attended school in Odessa. He did not go on to university, but travelled instead. While he was staying in Warsaw in 1852 a cholera epidemic broke out. With his kinsman, Ogiński, he set up a field hospital and helped to treat the victims. On his return to his home province, he was set to administer the family estates in Obodówką and Wasylówką. He was a member of the committee working to abolish Serfdom in Poland, which eventually happened in 1864 in the Russian Partition. ] Emilia, wife of Feliks In 1857 he married Emilia Łubieńska, a cousin. They had two sons, Michał and Kazimierz and a daughter, Wiktoria. From 1857 onwards, having acquired it at auction, he ran the vast 6,000 hectare estate of Guzów. It was a sale arising out of the confiscation of his and his wife's uncle Henryk's property due to charges of fraud.Gajewski M., Urządzenia komunalne Warszawy, W. 1979; Jaroszewski T.

When in 1862 his colleagues decided at an assembly in Kamieniec Podolski to seek to join the counties of Podolia and Wołyń to Congress Poland, he opposed the idea, but was out voted. Representations were therefore despatched to the Russian authorities. As a result, all the marshals were suspended from office, including Sobański, and were taken on remand to the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg. They were charged with Sedition. He was sentenced by decree of the Russian Senate to exile in the depths of Russia. He was later allowed to move to Odessa and, finally, given leave to return to Podolia. Following his release he travelled to France. While in Paris, he was caught up in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. He arranged with the International Red Cross to hire an ambulance and personally assisted in the removal of the wounded from the battlefield. Between 1872 and 1885 he concentrated on estate and rural matters. He invested huge sums in rebuilding and refashioning the Guzów Manor, turning it into a French renaissance-style palace with a park in the English style.

He was involved in the Stanisław Moniuszko Music Society, which raised funds to aid the impoverished composer. Sobański financed an extensive portfolio of church and other buildings and monuments, such as in Radziwiłłów, the chapel in Guzów, restorations in Obodówka and Wiskitki, paying for three marble altars to be brought from Italy for the church of St. Augustine in Warsaw or the restoration of the Sigismund's Column.List Ludwika Górskiego do ks.

He also funded travel bursaries for seminarians studying for the priesthood in Warsaw. He was rewarded in 1880 with a hereditary title of nobility from Pope Leo XIII. Foundations Among his other philanthropic projects were: * Headquarters and lodgings in Warsaw of a charity for disabled people, later expanded for: * Single women and a home for orphans * Catholic nursery in Kiev * Cottage hospital in Guzów for free treatment for tenant farmers and estate workers * A secondary agricultural school in Obodówka, overseen by the local farmers' association * A teacher training college in Ursynów Later years Sobański supported financially many social institutions in his homeland as well as in Paris, where there was a substantial Polish diaspora and where he settled for the last dozen years of his life. He participated in the cultural life of the capital and joined the Historical and Literary Society there. His final bounty was to give 100,000 roubles to the Polish rural workers retirement fund and 30,000 roubles to buy potatoes for the rural poor of Galicia suffering a period of famine.

Adopted by a French family as a child, Placé entered politics as a member of the Radical Party of the Left before joining Europe Ecology – The Greens. He and fellow Green François de Rugy left the party in 2015 to found their own Ecologist Party. He formerly was Senator for the department of Essonne, Secretary of State for State Reform and Simplification in the Second Valls government, and president of political group Union des démocrates et des écologistes.  Early life and career  Little is known about Placé's origins, apart from the fact that he spent part of his childhood in an orphanage in Suwon, South Korea. Although his birth certificate states he was born Kwon Oh-bok () in Seoul on 12 March 1968, Placé himself has expressed doubts about the date because of his situation as an orphan; at the time of his adoption by a French family in 1975, he reportedly appeared younger than his official age. He then grew up with his adoptive family in Normandy. After studying economics, Placé, then 26 years old, met La Rochelle mayor and Parliament member Michel Crépeau and became active within his party \\"Movement of Radicals of the Left\\" (later Radical Party of the Left). According to L'Obs, Placé also joined the Grand Orient de France, France's largest Masonic organization. He became an attaché to Crépeau until Crépeau's death in 1999, after which Placé left the Radical Party and joined The Greens, which later became Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV).  Political career  The 2004 French regional elections saw Jean-Vincent Placé being elected as a member of the regional council of Île-de-France, on a list of candidates led by Socialist Jean-Paul Huchon, as the result of an alliance between The Greens and the Socialist Party. Placé was subsequently elected as the head of the Green group within the council. In 2011, under EELV membership, Placé was elected as senator for the department of Essonne. In 2012, he became the first president of the newly-formed Ecologist group in the French Senate. In 2014, Placé publicly criticized the \\"leftist\\" direction his party was allegedly taking and lamented it had become \\"the party of Romani people and Palestine\\" instead of focusing on environmental issues. Eventually, in 2015, upset by talks of alliance between EELV and the Left Front for the regional elections, Jean-Vincent Placé and François de Rugy both left EELV and founded their own centre-left, green party, Écologistes ! (later the Ecologist Party). The party then participated in the creation of political group Union des démocrates et des écologistes (UDE) of which Placé became the first president. From 2016 to 2017, he was appointed by then-Prime Minister Manuel Valls as \\"Secretary of State for State Reform and Simplification\\" in Valls's second government. In order to access government office, Placé stepped down from his positions as senator and president of the Senate's Ecologist group. In 2016, Placé applied for the honorary title of Colonel of the citizen reserve forces within the 13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment. In December 2016, when Bernard Cazeneuve was appointed Prime Minister, Placé retained his position within his government as Secretary of State for State Reform and Simplification. In the 2017 Socialist primaries, Jean-Vincent Placé showed support for former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who eventually lost the primary to Benoît Hamon. Placé then backed the Socialist candidate Hamon during the presidential campaign. Following the formation of Prime Minister Édouard Philippe's first government in 2017, Placé was no longer a member of the French government and took back his position within the Senate, this time as a member of the Socialist and Republican group. In September 2017, after being mugged in the streets of Paris, he publicly expressed his desire to put his political career on hold, thus declining to stand in the then-upcoming senatorial elections. When Placé made his announcement, his name was not on any candidate list for the Senate. He remained a member of the regional council of Île-de-France. In April 2018, following issues with alcoholism and a publicized incident in a Paris nightclub, Placé resigned from his position as president of UDE.  Legal issues  In 2011, during an appearance on television, Placé reacted to then- UMP member of Parliament Christian Vanneste's recent comments about same-sex marriage, by calling Vanneste \\"despicable\\" and claiming he had a reputation for \\"homophobic\\", \\"racist\\", \\"maybe even antisemitic\\" remarks. Vanneste then sued Placé for defamation. A Paris court eventually sentenced Placé to a fine and ordered him to pay Vanneste in damages. In 2013, an investigation by newspaper Le Canard enchaîné revealed that Placé owed more than to the region of Île-de-France, mostly in unpaid traffic fines. Placé, who acknowledged his mistake, explained he was \\"not a man of numbers\\" and swore to pay his fines. In 2014, he stormed out of a talk show where the topic was brought up again, saying his situation was now resolved. In September 2017, Placé was assaulted in the streets of Paris: the robbers took his cellphone, credit card, and watch. Placé later told the press he was considering putting his political career on hold. On the night between 4 and 5 April 2018, an intoxicated Placé was arrested outside a Paris nightclub by French police and kept into custody for 37 hours. He was charged with \\"disrespect towards police officers\\", \\"racial insults\\" and \\"violent behavior under the influence\\", and brought to the courts. Placé then resigned from his position as president of UDE. In an interview with Paris Match, Placé apologized for disorderly intoxication and revealed he had been struggling with alcoholism for several months. However, he denied allegations of any sexist or racist behavior. In September 2018, a Paris court found him guilty of \\"acts of violence\\" and gave him a fine and a three-month suspended sentence, while dismissing the charge of \\"racial insults\\".  Personal life  Although Placé was born in South Korea and spent part of his childhood there, he claims little relation to his birth country and credits his identity to education within the \\"School of the [French] Republic\\". After being adopted in 1975 by a French family he describes as politically \\"Gaullist\\", he did not set foot in South Korea again until an official visit in 2011. While there, he said to the local press \\"France is my country\\" and reportedly told locals he was unable to speak their language. Placé was previously in a relationship with fellow Green politician Cécile Duflot. After the end of what Placé calls a \\"love story\\", he began a relationship with another Green politician, French Parliament member Éva Sas. Together they had a daughter who was born in November 2013. Placé and Sas separated in 2014.

Coin, for scale, is 1.905 cm wide. A second specimen, from the same locality as the first. Scale is in cm. Edward Hitchcock erected the ichnogenus Bifurculapes, meaning \\"two little forked feet,\\" for trace fossils that were discovered in the Early Jurassic Turners Falls Formation in the Deerfield Basin of Massachusetts. They are insect or crustacean trackways that consist of two rows of two to three tracks per series, with the two larger tracks being oriented parallel or oblique to the trackway axis. The third track, when present, is much smaller than the other two and is oriented approximately perpendicular to the trackway axis. Medial drag marks sometimes are present between the track rows. In trace fossil classification schemes based on behavior, Bifurculapes is considered a repichnion, or locomotion trace. Hitchcock originally erected four ichnospecies, B. elachistotatus, B. laqueatus, B. scolependroideus, and B. tuberculatus, but subsequently removed B. tuberculatus while erecting B. curvatus. Since Hitchcock did not establish a type species, Lull (1953) designated B. laqueatus as the lectotype. In a recent revision of the ichnogenus, Getty (2016) recognized only two ichnospecies, B. laqueatus and B. scolependroideus; B. curvatus and B. elachistotatus were considered junior subjective synonyms of B. laqueatus, whereas B. tuberculatus was considered a nomen dubium. More recently, Getty (2018) considered the ichnogenus Camurichnus as a minor morphological variant of Bifurculapes. Outside of the Deerfield Basin, undoubted examples of Bifurculapes have been found only in the East Berlin Formation of the adjacent Hartford Basin (Getty 2016), the Lockatong Formation of Pennsylvania, and the Moenave Formation of the Zuni sag.

The executive order came on Trump's campaign pledges to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and occurred just hours after he was sworn into office. Trump stated sorting out a replacement will take a long time and the replacement may not be ready until 2018.Trump Appears to Push Back Obamacare Replacement Following several failed efforts by Congress to pass an alternative to the ACA, Trump issued another executive order in October 2017, the Executive Order to Promote Healthcare Choice and Competition, which some proponents and opponents asserted effectively replaced the ACA with a new healthcare regime.  Provisions  The order was designed to weaken regulations and procedures associated with enforcement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It was broken into six sections: * An attempt to seek efficient implementation of the law, focused on removing regulatory burdens during the repealment of the law. * The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services and heads of other U.S. executive departments should waive, defer, grant exemptions or delay implementation any requirements of the act that would place fiscal burdens. * Those department heads are also ordered to grant greater flexibility to states seeking to implement healthcare programs. * Seeking an open market across state lines in the healthcare market. * Compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act regarding implementation of the regulatory revisions within this executive order. * The order does not impact the Office of Management and Budget and its work, does not impact the legal authority of any department head of a U.S. federal agency and does not grant any specific rights to anyone within the United States.  Effects  In February 2017, it was reported that the Internal Revenue Service would not require tax filers to state whether they had compliant insurance, allowing them to avoid the penalty fine. The IRS said that this change would reduce administrative burdens on taxpayers. It was criticized for weakening an enforcement mechanism that lowers premiums by supporting wide participation in the markets.

The work on the estates was done by African slaves brought from what is now the Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola. These people were from the Kingdom of Kongo and Kingdom of Loango. There were also Yoruba slaves. The culture of African and Spanish inhabitants has merged into the \\"drum dancing\\", Barlovento's typical Afro-Venezuelan celebration. This occurs particularly at the time of the feast of San Juan.

Geography Chirimena Tricolored heron (Garza Pechiblanca) in Barlovento Barlovento has an area of 4,647 square kilometres. It covers 58 percent of Miranda state. The Barlovento region lies within the Barlovento depression in the northern coastal region.Natural physical aspects Minamb Venezuela. Its terrain is ranges from the mountains of Caucagua to the beaches of Higuerote and Río Chico. The exploration of the Plain of Barlovento, which forms the base of the Barlovento depression, was documented by Jesus A. Silva I.Jesus Silva I Cronista Silva Irazabal website. It lies between the Valles del Tuy to the east and Anzoátegui state to the west. To the south is the Guárico state. To the north and northeast is Mirandize state. This northern area is rich in limestone. It is formed by deposits from the rivers from the Serranía del Interior mountains in the central region of the Cordillera de la Costa. Among the slopes of the Serranía del Interior are grottoes, caves and caverns. An example is La Tapa de Cambrai near Birongo.Cueva la Tapa de Cambural natural monument Wikimap It was discovered by a poacher in 1934 and explored on 9 March 1952 by the Venezuelan Society of Natural Sciences.

Religion From the 1500s, the people of Barlovento, plantation owners and their African slaves, developed an avidity for the feast of San Juan. Celebrations with music and dancing were made. Despite the objections of Bishop Mariano Marti to these \\"ridiculous and earthly diversions\\" when he visited the region in 1784, the festival continued to gain in popularity. The date of the feast, June 25, aligned with the harvesting of the cocoa bean crop, the onset of the wet season and the summer solstice.Nichols E. and Morse K. Venezuela ABC-CLIO, 2010 p. 177. Culture Cuisine The typical cuisine of Barlovento reflects the cultures of the different immigrant groups to the area. The cuisine incorporates local products such as grains, tubers, bananas, fish, seafood, and lapa. One of the oldest dishes is the Cafunga. It is from the African culture and consists of a banana muffin prepared with cassava, coconut, papelón and anise. Other popular dishes are Tropezón, white beans cooked with pork skins; \\"Soup of Massey\\", white with sardines and garlic; and Bañao, cooked ripe banana with caramel made of papelón, anise, and spice clove. Tacarigua de la Laguna is famous for the preparation of roast Lebranche mullet. Crafts Roadside kiosk in Barlovento The people of Barlovento make sculptures, replicas and trinkets with balsa wood, other local wood and coconuts. These are sold and informally displayed by the sides of the roads. For example, in the village of Yagura, balsa wood replicas of aircraft and military helicopters are seen. Again for example, in the village of Gamelotal, between Caucagua and Tacarigua de Mamporal (Tacarigua de Brión), Adam Expedito López is a local sculptor working with wood and coconuts. He creates pylons, portraits of Bolívar and coconuts with the faces of caciques among others. In Higuerote, artisans produce in wood the birds of the canals and lagoons of Barlovento, including coro-coras, and herons. Hammocks are also made. In Barlovento, and particularly Curiepe, artisans make drums for African dancing. They include the curbata, the mina and the culepuya. The culepuya has three varieties, the prima, cruzao and pujao. Furrucos are also made for making Christmas music. African drum dancing Afro-Venezuelan drumming is part of the culture of Barlovento. Photo from Bobures Lake, south of Maracaibo. Playing of African drums and dancing to the rhythms (\\"drum dancing\\") is an important cultural element in Barlovento. This is particularly so on 24 June of each year, the feast of San Juan (John the Baptist) in the Catholic Church. Barlovento is the region of Venezuela that is particularly known for this African influence as it was an area, especially the local town of Curiepe, which received African slaves. Recreation Sites Higuerote, Barlovento Barlovento has beaches, private clubs, and large residential complexes. its hotels include the AB Beach Hotel, Barlovento Hotel, Campomar, Las Olas Resort, and Aguamarina.
