A lung disease caused him to take singing lessons as therapeutic breathing exercises. His natural dispositions led him to the conservatory of Toulon and then to the Marseille conservatory where he obtained a First Prize. On 7 June 1913, he married a young pianist in Toulon: Marie-Louise Bonduel (Toulon, 22 August 1886 - Brussels, 30 November 1970), whose family was linked to personalities such as Claude Debussy, Xavier Leroux and Camille Saint-Sa√´ns. He made his debut on the stage of the Op√©ra de Toulon. His voice of baritone of op√©ra comique and his physical appearance as a \\"young premier\\" made him noticeable by opera directors who called him on stages all over the country and beyond: Toulouse, Nancy, Strasbourg, Geneva, Algiers, Marseille, Tunis, Nantes.

She was the first female lawyer and public notary in South Australia. She wrote nine legal textbooks and from 1950 until 1959 served as Chief of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. She was an early advocate for child welfare and juvenile justice in Australia. Early life and education Mary Cecil Kitson was born on 9 December 1893, the fourth of seven children to John Kitson, a police officer, and Mary Agnes McClure, in the Mid North South Australian town of Caltowie. They moved to Adelaide, where John was a Detective Inspector, and Mary and her sister attended St Aloysius College, where she was head prefect and dux. Adelaide University had been open to female students since the 1880s, but few women studied law as they could not practice. Tenison Woods was one of the first, beginning her degree in 1912, and the first South Australian woman to graduate with a Bachelor of Laws in 1916. Career=Legal practice= Tenison Woods was the first woman admitted to practice law in South Australia on 20 October 1917, after the passing of the Female Law Practitioners Act of 1911. After completing her articles with Poole and Johnstone in 1917, she was named managing clerk of the firm. Thomas Slaney Poole had been one of her University lecturers and was soon after promoted to the Supreme Court. In 1919, she became a partner, with the firm changing its name to Johnstone, Ronald and Kitson. Her brother, Augustine, was articled to the firm. It was seen as appropriate for Tenison Woods to work on court cases with children involved, although at the time there were no separate courts or differentiation of charges for children. She later said, \\"I was shocked at what I saw ... frightened little children were treated as adult criminals, being called on to plead guilty or not before His Sovereign Majesty, and so forth. I got interested in child welfare right away, and that interest increased with the years.\\" In 1921, Tenison Woods applied to become a public notary, a role that had been restricted to men. This led to debate around the meaning of the word 'person' in the relevant Act, which Poole, hearing her application, declared to mean 'man'. Supporters, including Edward Charles Stirling who had introduced women's suffrage into the South Australian parliament, encouraged parliament to pass the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act in 1921, allowing Woods to be appointed to the office. After her marriage in 1924, Tenison Woods was no longer allowed to remain in the partnership. She and recent graduate Dorothy Somerville then formed the first Australian law firm composed solely of female partners, called Kitson & Somerville. After her husband's disbarring and abandonment of her in 1927, Tenison Woods left the firm to join Bennett, Campbell, Browne and Atkinson in 1928, where she was able to ensure a more secure income. =Research and writing= Tenison Woods received a grant from the Carnegie Corporation to study delinquency in South Australia. Her research led to the establishment of a Children's Court with a specially appointed magistrate. She published her first book, Juvenile Delinquent, in 1925. After her divorce, Tenison Woods moved to Sydney in 1933, where she worked as a legal editor for Butterworths. She wrote seven legal textbooks including War Damage Legislation, Ex-Servicemen's Legislation, and Landlord Tenant and Land Sales Legislation. She also wrote a book of anecdotes with Marjorie Robertson titled Leaves From a Woman Lawyer's Notebook. From 1935 to 1940, Tenison Woods taught on the legal aspects of social work at Sydney University and was a member of the University Board of Social Study and Training. She was appointed Chair of the Delinquency Committee of the Child Welfare Council of NSW. During World War II, she was on the board of the Women's Australian National Services. In 1942, Tenison Woods received funding from the Children's Advisory Council, the Australian Council for Educational Research and the Australian Trained Social Workers' Association to undertake a comparative study of British child welfare policies and practices. After her return, as Chair of the Children's Advisory Council, she urged the Minister for Education, Clive Evatt to undertake reform of the entire NSW welfare system. When no action was taken, she wrote two articles for the Sydney Morning Herald in 1944 highlighting problems at the Parramatta Girls Home and the Gosford Farm Home for Boys, which were influential in leading to the creation of a separate Department of Child Welfare. In 1945, Tenison Woods was invited to speak at an International Labour Organization conference in Montreal, but did not receive a permit to travel from the Department of External Affairs in time to attend. In 1946, she travelled to London and met with women pioneers in a number of fields, reporting to the BBC and the ABC on her meetings. In 1947, she was guest speaker at the first Australian Conference of Social Work. =Advocacy for women= Alongside Jean Daly, Phyllis Burke and others, Tenison Woods formed a group called \\"Altair\\" in 1944, with the object of monitoring public officials and convincing legislators and church officials to include women's views on political and social issues. They were supported by Archbishop Norman Thomas Gilroy, however he did not support their decision in 1946 to form a NSW section of the St Joan's Social and Political Alliance. Gilroy forbade members of the Legion of Catholic Women from joining. The group had consultative status at the United Nations, and in 1950, Tenison Woods was nominated to become a member of the Status of Women office. Tenison Woods was appointed chief of the Status of Women Commission in 1951 and moved to New York City. She stayed in the role until 1958, working with women lawyers across Europe and Asia, providing information and support on women's rights issues. During her term the Convention on the Political Rights of Women and the Convention on the Nationality of Married Women were adopted. =Later life= Tenison Woods returned to Australia in 1959. She wrote two further textbooks for Butterworths. She was Honorary Solicitor to the SA Women's Hockey Association from 1925 until 1971 and to the Australian Croquet Council from 1925 until 1971. She was a foundation member and later life member of the Lyceum Club in Adelaide. When Roma Mitchell was appointed Australia's first female QC in 1962, Woods sent her a congratulatory telegram saying \\"you are indeed making history.\\" Honours The Law Society of South Australia called Tenison Woods an \\"authoritative and widely published voice\\" on child welfare and an advocate for the advancement of women. She was awarded an OBE in 1950 and a CBE in 1958 for her child welfare work. There is a Mary Kitson Street in Watson, ACT named after her. Personal life Tenison Woods married lawyer Gordon Tenison Woods at St Laurence's Church, North Adelaide, on 13 December 1924. He was a great- nephew to Julian Tenison-Woods, was two years younger than Mary, and had been an editor of the Adelaide University magazine alongside her. In 1926, he was struck off the roll of legal practitioners for misuse of trust funds. One of the complainants was his father. He then abandoned Tenison Woods and their son, who had cerebral palsy, moving to New Zealand. She obtained a divorce in 1933, and moved with her son to Sydney. Tenison Woods retired to Sydney and died in Ryde, New South Wales on 18 October 1971.

Career=Rise to success and Eleague 2017= Punk began playing Street Fighter professionally after the release of Street Fighter IV in 2009. Though he occasionally visited local events, Punk primarily played Street Fighter online while focusing on his education. When Street Fighter V was released in 2016, Punk had completed high school and began attending tournaments more frequently. Punk first appeared on the professional scene when he qualified for the 2016 Red Bull Battlegrounds (the North American Capcom Pro Tour regional finals) through netplay. Here, Punk defeated various high-level players such as Filipino ChampRyan \\"Filipino Champ\\" Ramirez, Chris Tatarian, and Justin Wong, and settled on third place after losing to Tokido and NuckleDu. In the months after, Punk took home first place three tournaments in a row: Northeast Championships, Winter Brawl, and The King of New York. At the Austin, Texas tournament Fighters Underground in March 2017, Punk defeated players such as NuckleDu, Yusuke Momochi, and Arman \\"Phenom\\" Hanjani in the group stage, but was defeated by Justin Wong and Filipino Champ and ended up tied for seventh place. On March 8, 2017, Panda Global announced that the company had signed Punk, with CEO Alan Bunney predicting that Punk would be \\"one of the dark horses of 2017.\\" This contract came ahead of South by Southwest (SXSW) 2017 and the ELeague Street Fighter V Invitational that ran from March 27 to May 26. At SXSW Conference's Fighters Underground, Punk beat NuckleDu, Yusuke Momochi, Filipino Champ, and K-Brad in the group stages, but quickly bottomed out on day 2 because he felt unusually nervous. At the Eleague opening event on March 27, Punk was able to defeat all opponents except for Evo 2016-champion Lee \\"Infiltration\\" Seon-woo. During Eleague and the early 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, Punk's dominating play-style with the character Karin and his trash-talk during interviews became frequently discussed. After winning West Coast Warzone 6, Punk stated that he wanted \\"to do well at tournaments so people can't talk [shit] about me. I like when people boo me. It motivates me to keep winning. I don't even have to respond back.\\" Punk noted that people would get frustrated while playing against him. When Punk competed in California again during the 2017 NorCal Regionals, he was routinely teabagging his opponents Long \\"Circa LPN\\" Nguyen and NuckleDu in an effort to taunt them. After winning the tournament, Punk told Kotaku that he uses teabagging to undermine and distract his opponents, stating that the taunt \\"gets in certain people's heads and messes them up.\\" Though this behavior was answered by laughs and cheers from the crowd, Punk's teabagging proved controversial throughout the fighting game community. Punk went on to win the 2017 Eleague Street Fighter V Invitation, defeating Arman \\"Phenom\\" Hanjani in the finals. Phenom kicked Punk into the loser's bracket during their first match-up in the tournament, but when Punk faced Phenom's character Necalli again in the grand final, he won the match 4‚Äì2, taking home $150,000 USD in prize earnings. =Second half of the 2017 Capcom Cup= Punk placed second at Evo 2017, losing to Street Fighter veteran Hajime \\"Tokido\\" Taniguchi. After defeating Itabashi Zangief and Kazunoko, Punk faced Tokido's Akuma in the winner's finals, but eventually lost against him 6‚Äì1. After accepting his second-place medal, Punk buried his face in his hands. Later that night, Punk sent out the Twitter message: \\"Let everyone down I'm so disappointed in myself.\\" Punk competed once more at the Red Bull Battlegrounds, which served again as the Capcom Pro Tour North American regional final. This time, Punk was a high ranking player, and he went up against a new player - Derek \\"iDom\\" Ruffin - in the finals. Punk defeated iDom 3‚Äì2, taking the title and the US$12,000 first-place prize. In a post-match interview, Punk stated that \\"[Winning this tournament] actually means a lot,\\" as he originally entered the scene through Red Bull Battlegrounds one year prior. After having won a large number of tournaments in the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, Punk entered the Capcom Cup as the top seed. However, Punk tied for ninth place after losing to Last Chance-qualifier Naoki \\"Nemo\\" Nemoto and fellow newcomer Naoki \\"Moke\\" Nakayama. =2018 Capcom Pro Tour=Background Woodley was only 18 years old when he became a professional Street Fighter player in 2016, much younger than most of his competitors. In an interview with Red Bull in April 2017, he stated: \\"I actually like having a target on my back. It's good that everyone wants to beat me. I like the feeling of people being scared or nervous when they seem me in their pool. I really like that.\\" Punk chose his screen name in honor of pro wrestler Phillip Jack Brooks, who goes by the ring name \\"CM Punk\\".

It is built above an ancient Roman bath house. The remains were uncovered during building work when the present pub was erected in 1929-31 replacing an inn. The exterior has Tudor Revival features including applied half-timbering. The pub is however more notable for the Roman remains which can be viewed inside. The bath house apparently served the military personnel of Eboracum (Roman York). Not only was the facility was in Eboracum¬¥s fortress (built in the 1st century AD to house a legion of about 5,000 men), but also tiles have been discovered at the bath house site which are marked with the identity of specific legions. The Ninth may have constructed the facility. The last attested activity of the Ninth in Britain is in AD 108. Baths dating from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD have been excavated in another part of York: these are believed to have served the civilian population. Access and conservation The pub is a Grade II* listed building. It was listed in 1954, relatively early for a pub from the interwar period.In 2015 Historic England listed a number of interwar pubs at which time it was noted that relatively few such buildings survived unaltered. See This suggests that the existence of Roman ruins was the main reason for listing. The Roman remains may be visited. A fee is payable. The Caldarium The caldarium and some other features of the baths are visible. Some of the other facilities would have been outside the corner site occupied by the pub: much of the baths have yet to be excavated. The site as a whole is protected through its location within the walled city of York, designated as an 'Area of Archaeological Importance' (AAI) under Part 2 of the 1979 Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act. See also There are other examples in the UK of Roman baths serving forts, for example the infrastructure at Caerleon, also a legionary fortress, where there was a frigidarium, tepidarium and caldarium, as well as an open-air swimming pool.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. It now houses the house the Millington-Arbela Historical Society's museum. History Millington Township was first settled in 1850. Logging began a few years later, and the railroad line came through in 1871. This led to the platting in 1873 of the village of Millington. The village was incorporated in 1877, and by 1881 had a population of about 450 people. The first local bank in Millington was established in the early 1890s by local druggist John A. Damon, who founded the Millington Bank. By 1893 Damon had sold out to F.E. Kelsey and Co. owned by Frederick E. Kelsey and Julian D. Wilsey. In 1897, Kelsey and Wilsey purchased the site on which this building sits; the bank building was almost certainly constructed later that year or in early 1898. At the end of 1898, Kelsey and Wilsey sold the bank property to Caro bankers William H. Carson and John M. Ealy. The firm took on more partners, and Carson died in 1904; by 1907 the firm running the Millington Bank was called Ealy, Evans & Co. Ealy, however, overextended by purchasing or establishing a string of banks in the region, and in 1927 declared bankruptcy. A new bank, the Millington National Bank, was formed in 1927 and purchased the former Bank of Millington building in 1929. However, the Millington National Bank failed in 1933. The building housed a medical practice from 1938 to 1948, served as the public library from 1952 to 1972, and housed a photo studio and card shop from 1972 to 1995. After this, the building was refurbished to house the Millington-Arbela Historical Society's museum. The museum continues to operate in the building. Description The Millington Bank Building is a single story commercial building constructed with split fieldstone walls and a flat roof. The building measures twenty-four feet in width by thirty feet in depth. The main facade has two similar broad, arched openings. One holds the recessed main entrance, the other opening holds a tripartite window with double-hung sash. A cornice runs across the top. The interior was and is a single room, with a brick vault against the rear wall.

It was written by Mark Frost and David Lynch, directed by Lynch, and stars Kyle MacLachlan. \\"Part 3\\" was released on Showtime's streaming service Showtime Anytime along with Part 4 on May 21, 2017, immediately after the broadcast of the double premiere; it was eventually broadcast on Showtime on May 28, 2017, and seen by an audience of 195,000 viewers in the United States. It received mainly positive reviews.  Plot =Background= The small town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has been sent to the town to investigate and has discovered that the killer was Laura's father, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise), who acted while possessed by a demonic entity, Killer BOB (Frank Silva). At the end of the original series, BOB trapped Cooper in the Black Lodge, an extra-dimensional place, and let out Cooper's doppelg√§nger to use him for physical access to the world. 25 years later, Cooper's doppelg√§nger roams freely through the world, with Cooper still inside the Lodge.David Lynch (writer and director), Mark Frost (writer) (May 21, 2017). \\"Part 1\\".

Twin Peaks He eventually lands on a glass box in New York City; he is absorbed by it and floats inside, only to disappear before the box's absent guardian, Sam Colby (Benjamin Rosenfield), returns with Tracey Barberato (Madeline Zima). =Events= Cooper continues to descend through space. He eventually lands on a balcony; looking outside, he observes a purple ocean stretching as far as he can see. Cooper enters the building through a set of windows; inside, in a nightmarish blur, a woman with scars on her face and large patches of skin over her eyes (Nae Yuuki) sits in front of a lit fireplace. Cooper asks the woman where they are, but she responds only with disjointed, high-pitched breath noises. A loud pounding is heard, as if something very powerful is trying to enter the room, and the woman signals Cooper to be quiet. He notices a large electrical throw-switch mechanism on the wall labeled with the number 15, but she keeps him away from it and leads him up a ladder. They reach the roof, where the structure they had been inside appears as a metallic cuboid floating in space with a bell-shaped mechanism on its top. The woman throws a switch on the mechanism and receives an electric shock, which throws her into the void but makes the hitherto blurred reality come into focus. After she has fallen out of sight, Garland Briggs's (Don S. Davis) head floats under the structure and says \\"Blue rose.\\"David Lynch (writer and director), Mark Frost (writer) (May 21, 2017). \\"Part 3\\". Twin Peaks Cooper walks back downstairs and encounters another woman (Phoebe Augustine, who plays Ronette Pulaski in previous installments of Twin Peaks but is listed in the episode's credits as \\"American Girl\\") sitting in front of the fireplace. Cooper approaches her while she checks her wristwatch; as the watch strikes 2:53, the mechanism on the wall, now labeled with the number 3, begins to hum, and a light on a coffee table turns on. In South Dakota, Cooper's doppelg√§nger is driving along a deserted road when he begins to feel uncomfortable. The cigarette lighter in his car begins to exercise an electric force on him. Cooper observes the mechanism as the woman by the fireplace tells him, \\"When you get there, you will already be there;\\" he approaches the machinery, but recoils when his face begins to deform. He continues to feel uncomfortable, while back in the purple room, more insistent pounding is heard, and the American Girl tells Cooper to leave because her mother is coming. Cooper approaches the throw-switch mechanism again, and it begins to suck him into itself, elongating and deforming his body and leaving only his shoes behind. The doppelg√§nger begins to lose consciousness and loses control of the car, crashing on the side of the road. He gags, but holds back his vomit; as the cigarette lighter continues to exercise the force over him, red drapes faintly appear in front of him. In a house for sale in the Rancho Rosa estates, Las Vegas, Dougie Jones, a man physically identical to Cooper but for his weight, hair and clothes (MacLachlan) sits with prostitute Jade (Nafessa Williams) on his lap, saying that his arm (on which he wears the Owl Cave ring) feels \\"tingly.\\" Jade takes her payment and proceeds to shower; Dougie gets out of bed only to experience greater pain and weakness. He falls down, as the doppelg√§nger continues to hold his mouth in South Dakota. Dougie crawls down the corridor, attempting but failing to alert Jade; he proceeds to move toward an electric socket, which exercises a force on him. As red curtains faintly appear in front of him, Dougie vomits and is transported away with a loud noise, which at last alerts Jade. The red curtains fade away and the doppelg√§nger vomits a mixture of creamed corn and engine oil and passes out. In the Black Lodge, Dougie is seated before MIKE (Al Strobel), who explains that someone manufactured him for a purpose. Dougie's hand begins to shrink, and the ring falls down; his heads pops out with a hiss, producing black smoke, and a golden orb floats out of it. Dougie's body deflates; an egglike object appears, prompting MIKE to shield its sight. The object deflates, letting a golden orb fly out of it; the orb and the object collide on the armchair, which produces smoke and a loud electrical crackling noise. When MIKE looks back, a small golden orb is on the chair; he picks it up along with the ring, which he proceeds to put on a pedestal. In the house, a cloud of black smoke pours out of the socket and materializes into Cooper on the ground near Dougie's vomit. Jade exits the shower, and takes Cooper for Dougie; she is surprised to see him in a suit, with less weight and different hair, but is disgusted by the vomit and suggests that he could be sick. Cooper does not seem to react to her, and stands up or moves only when pushed. He exits the house with Jade, who notices that he is not wearing any shoes and tells him to go back and put them on; as he does not react, she walks back inside and takes them for him, only for him to follow her back in again. Jade eventually fastens his shoes for him and begins to take his nonresponsive state for granted; when searching his pockets for his car keys, she can find only the key to Cooper's room in the Great Northern Hotel, which puzzles and upsets her, as she now has to drive him back. As the duo drive away, Gene (Bill Tangradi), a paid killer, parks in front of the house, and Jake (Greg Vrotos), his partner, says he is ready to shoot him if they pass by the entrance. Jade tells Cooper to call AAA as soon as he finds a wallet or some money; when they pass through Sycamore Street, he takes out the key to his room and begins to observe it. When the car hits a bump, the key falls, and Cooper bends down to take it, so Jake does not see him as they pass. Cooper eventually gets up without the key; as Gene is told that Dougie did not leave Rancho Rosa, he puts an explosive device under Dougie's car and drives away. A boy (Sawyer Shipman) observes the scene from his house across the street, as his drugged- out mother (Hailey Gates) repeatedly yells \\"One-one-nine,\\" takes a pill with whiskey and lights a cigarette. Two highway patrolmen reach the doppelg√§nger's car in South Dakota; when one of them, Billy (Travis Hammer), checks inside the car, he becomes immediately ill from the smell, prompting his partner (Stephen Heath) to call for backup. At the Twin Peaks Sheriff Station, Hawk (Michael Horse), Lucy (Kimmy Robertson) and Andy (Harry Goaz) sort through files in search for something missing that relates to Hawk's heritage. Upon seeing a box of chocolate bunnies amid the evidence, Lucy, guilt-stricken, uncomfortably admits to have eaten one of the bunnies years before to get rid of \\"a bubble of gas.\\" Andy asks Hawk if Native Americans use chocolate as a remedy; Hawk responds that the investigation is not about the bunny, but thinks for a moment before deciding that the bunny is not relevant to their search. On the White Tail Peak, Lawrence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn) spray-paints five shovels with golden paint and hangs them to dry. Jade drops Cooper at the Silver Mustang Casino, giving him $5 and instructing him to call for help; when she orders him out of the car, Cooper remembers Laura Palmer telling him that he can go out. Cooper begins repeating \\"Call for help\\", the last thing Jade said to him, to anyone who asks or prompts him. After struggling to pass through the revolving doors, he enters the casino; he is redirected by a guard (Brian Finney) to the cashier (Meg Foster) who changes his money. Cooper walks onto the casino floor, where he observes a man (John Ennis) hitting a jackpot and exclaiming \\"Hellooo-ooo!\\". Cooper notices a floating apparition above one of the slot machines, depicting the Red Room. He approaches it and repeats the jackpot winner's behavior, gestures and exclamations of verbatim; he hits a mega-jackpot, and is complimented by another patron (Josh McDermitt) for having \\"broken it.\\" Cooper follows the apparition to another slot, again imitates the other winner and hits another mega-jackpot as an old lady (Linda Portress) stares at him in envy; the floor attendant, Jackie (Sabrina S. Sutherland), congratulates him and when Cooper says \\"Call for help\\", goes to fetch a bigger bucket. Cooper points at another slot machine with the Red Room apparition next to the old woman; angered, the woman gives him the finger. As he walks away, she covetously eyes the mega-jackpot winnings he left behind but cannot take them because the CCTVs are on, prompting her to angrily give a camera the finger. Cooper follows the floating sign to yet another slot, while Jackie returns and is told that he left; she leaves a guard to watch the winnings. Cooper plays at the machine and wins a third mega-jackpot; upon seeing this, the old woman goes to the slot machine Cooper pointed to before, wins a mega-jackpot and claps and cheers ecstatically. At FBI headquarters in Philadelphia, Deputy Director Gordon Cole (David Lynch) and Agents Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) and Tamara Preston (Chrysta Bell) discuss a case with five other agents: a congressman has been accused of brutally murdering his wife and claims to be innocent but unable to identify of the killer as it would breach national security. He gives them instead a series of clues: a photo of a woman in bikini, a pair of pincers, a photo of two more girls in bikinis, a picture of a child in sailing attire, a machine gun and a jar of lentils. Cole assigns all agents except Tammy to the case; he then asks her to brief him and Albert on her investigation of a double murder in New York. Tammy shows them photos from the building, including one of Sam Colby's and Tracey Barberato's mangled corpses, and the only photo the cameras have captured of the Experiment (Erica Aynon). Cole is informed that there is a call for him about Cooper, which shocks him and Albert; the three of them run into Cole's office, where he takes the call and is informed that Cooper is being held prisoner in South Dakota. He arranges for him, Albert and Tammy to leave for South Dakota the following day, then leaves the room; Albert says to Tammy, \\"The absurd mystery of the strange forces of existence.\\" In the Roadhouse, the Cactus Blossoms play their song \\"Mississippi.\\"  Production  \\"Part 3\\", like the rest of the limited series, was written by Mark Frost and David Lynch and directed by Lynch. Frost had already written ten episodes of the original series‚Äîthe \\"Pilot\\" and Episodes 1, 2 and 8 with Lynch, plus Episodes 5, 7, 12, 14, 16, 26 and the original series finale, Episode 29. Lynch also directed six episodes of the original series‚Äîthe \\"Pilot\\", \\"Episode 2\\", \\"Episode 8\\", \\"Episode 9\\", \\"Episode 14\\" and \\"Episode 29\\". The episode is dedicated to the memory of Miguel Ferrer and Don S. Davis, who both appear in it, Ferrer in new material and Davis in archival footage. = Music = Almost every episode of the 2017 Twin Peaks series features a live performance by a band at the Roadhouse. In this episode the American country group Cactus Blossoms performs their song \\"Mississippi\\". Additionally, the song \\"Dream Recall\\" by Lynch and Dean Hurley is featured; as of January 2018, the song has not been released on any official soundtrack.  Reception =Broadcast= \\"Part 3\\" was originally released on the Showtime Anytime app together with Part 4 on May 22, 2017; the episode was subsequently broadcast on the Showtime network on May 28, 2017, and was watched by 195,000 viewers in the United States, the lowest number of viewers for the season. =Critical reception= \\"Part 3\\" received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode received a 100% rating with an average score of 8.5 out of 10 based on 21 reviews. The critics' consensus reads, \\"'Part 3' Shifts Twin Peaks signature strangeness into an intoxicating new gear while narrowing the season's off-kilter narrative focus.\\" Writing for IndieWire, Liz Shannon Miller praised the way Part 3 \\"really challenges the show‚Äôs link to what we consider normality‚Äîthe first half hour especially proves to be intense.\\" She called the earlier sequences of the episodes \\"exhilarating\\" \\"[f]or those who want nothing more than to delve into the mysteries of the Black Lodge and whatever happened to Agent Cooper,\\" while also writing that they \\"provide little respite for fans in search of solid ground.\\" She praised the episode as proof that \\"the descent into madness is real.\\" The New York Times Noel Murray called the episode \\"a dose of David Lynch madness so concentrated and so puzzling that it might‚Äôve been best just to let it bounce around in viewers‚Äô heads for a week\\"; he compared the episode's early scenes to Lynch's feature debut Eraserhead, \\"which also has images of a Godlike being yanking levers in a cosmic factory\\", and called them \\"wondrously confounding.\\" Murray praised Part 3's \\"'normal'\\" moments, while calling the episode as a whole mostly \\"pure, magnificent abstraction.\\" In his recap for Entertainment Weekly, Jeff Jensen gave Part 3 an A-, praising its first scene as a \\"mesmerizing passage of pure Lynchian invention,\\" \\"a wonderful flexing of Lynch‚Äôs intuitive art-making powers, and, in my view, a love letter to filmmaking and his fans.\\" He wrote that the episode \\"continued to defy our expectations of Twin Peaks here at the start. But I‚Äôm liking it and I find meaning in the challenge.\\" The A.V. Club's Emily L. Stephens gave Part 3 an A, citing the scene in Hawk's office as an example of the way the series \\"employs the cute stuff, the cozy stuff, the comfortable stuff [...] as a counterpoint to its cruelest moments.\\" She wrote that in the episode \\"women‚Äôs bodies are even more ostentatiously objectified\\", noting that Jade, \\"one of the few black actors in Twin Peaks, is introduced nude\\" and serves a small purpose to the plot, and that \\"the silhouette of Agent Tamara Preston [...] frames the scene\\" in which Cole and Rosenfield are told that Cooper is back; she clarifies that \\"[t]his is not a complaint\\", and praises it \\"as a comment on objectification\\" rather than \\"a thoughtless reiteration of it.\\" Finally, she praises \\"the imponderable experimentation of the opening, with Cooper descending into a dim room where an eyeless woman powers a clumsy vessel through a starry void.\\" Trivia * Albert's line \\"The absurd mystery of the strange forces of existence\\" was the subtitle of Lynch's unrealized film project Ronnie Rocket.

It has a border with England to the east, and is bounded by the Irish Sea to the north and west, and by the Bristol Channel to the south. It has an oceanic temperate climate which is markedly influenced by the North Atlantic Current carrying warm water from tropical latitudes. As a result, it has a much milder climate than most places in the world at similar latitudes. Altitudes range from sea-level to 1085 m on the Snowdon Massif. The ways in which land is used in Wales reflect conditions of climate, geology and topography, modified by long traditions of land management. Sheep-grazed pasture predominates in all of the lowland zone, with arable fields mainly confined to the east of the country, although specialised early potato enterprises are favoured by the mild climate of the western peninsulas of Ll≈∑n and Pembrokeshire. Some parts, like the Vale of Tywi and the coastal plain of Ceredigion are famed for dairy farming, as the combinations of soils and climate mean that good quality grass can be reliably grown. In contrast, many more elevated parts of the Welsh land are of limited use for agriculture, and extensive upland conifer forests were planted in the years following the two world wars. Wild habitats occupy steep land and other areas that are less profitable for commercial use, such as wetlands, moorlands and mountainous terrain. Compared with many countries, wild habitats are scattered and inextensive, but they include significant cliff, dune and other coastal habitats; increasingly rare species-rich pastures and meadows, and wet semi-natural pastures known as rhos in relatively lowland situations. Ffridd grasslands are areas of open, moderately or lightly grazed often minimally managed pastures on the partially enclosed slopes above the cultivated farmland, whilst oak woodlands are found on steep banks and valley sides, and there is an extensive assortment of moorland and mountain vegetation types. Limestone vegetation is not widespread, but is particularly important to conservationists because so many unusual species occur. Farming and forestry account for nearly all of the land surface, but there are other land-uses that overlap with this. For example, 20% of Wales is designated as National Parks. Unlike the National Parks in some other countries, like the US, the three Welsh Parks, Snowdonia, the Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons incorporate large swathes of farmed and afforested land. Other areas are designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, also comprising a mixture of land uses. Many forested areas are used for recreational activities like cycling, hiking and car rallying, whilst several of the rivers provide facilities for canoeists, and some of the lakes and reservoirs are popular for sailing. The high rainfall of Wales means that the river catchments (called \\"watersheds\\" in American English) are important for water supply, and have to be used in ways compatible with the safe collection and storage of water supplies. According to Welsh government research in 2010 the area of potential wind farm land in Wales was 3027 km2. Although wind farms put some constraints on farming and forestry, they are not incompatible with these land uses. The most recent figures for proportions of agricultural land are from 2011, and for forest and woodland from 2015. These figures show that nearly 50% of the land area was under permanent grass. Arable land occupied about 9% of the area, and rough grazing some 20%, with woodlands on farms accounting for more than 3%. Broadleaved (deciduous) woodland covered 5.5% and coniferous woodland (mainly forestry plantations) 6%. Natural Resources Wales' report on Woodlands for Wales indicators, currently (February 2018) states that the area of woodland in Wales is now 306,000 ha, comprising 156,000 ha of broadleaves, and 150,000 ha of conifers. Thus, since the 2015 statistics quoted above, broadleaved woodland has overtaken coniferous forests in its coverage of Wales. Other woodland types such as cleared and recently planted land covered a further 2% of the land. The remaining 4.5% of the land is under urban and industrial land-uses, including a significant proportion of land spoiled by industrial wastes, like coal and slate tips. The proportions of land covered by urban and industrial uses vary hugely from region to region, with areas of south-east Wales in particular being heavily urbanised. For example, Blaenau Gwent in the industrial part of south Wales is 20% built up, whilst Powys in mid-Wales is less than 1% built up. thumb400x400pxcenter Pasture and mountain land in the Brecon Beacons Sheep pasture at Cwmbyr, Powys, Wales  Grassland  Grasslands are defined by the Encyclopedia of Ecology and Environmental Management as areas \\"dominated by herbaceous species in which grasses or sedges are abundant, accompanied by forbs [herbs which are not grasses or sedges] .... with sometimes scattered shrubs and trees.\\" Ley, or improved grasslands are periodically ploughed and re-seeded with cultivated varieties of grasses, sometimes combined with clover, which are deemed suitable for the extant soil and climatic conditions. The moist Atlantic climate of lowland Wales is ideal for grass growth, and this is why so much of the land is given over to the production of grass to feed livestock. Some parts, like the Vale of Tywi, are particularly famed for the production of high quality grass, and consequently, high quality stock ‚Äì beef and dairy cattle in the case quoted. Land used for grazing is called pasture (from the Latin pastus, past participle of pascere, \\"to feed\\"). Pasture lands in the narrow sense are enclosed tracts of farmland, grazed by domesticated livestock, such as sheep, cattle, horses or pigs. The vegetation of tended pasture consists mainly of grasses, with variable contributions of legumes and other forbs. Pasture is typically grazed throughout the summer, in contrast to meadow which is ungrazed or used for grazing only after being mown to make hay or other forms of conserved grass for animal fodder which can be used to feed the stock outside the growing season. \\"The composition of lowland grasslands in Wales, as in many other parts of western Europe, was transformed during the twentieth century. Over the period between 1950 and 1980 especially, farmers were encouraged and supported to undertake grassland improvement by ploughing, reseeding, fertiliser application and, where considered necessary, drainage.\\" During the period between 1930 and 1990, some 97% of the drier types of semi- natural grasslands were lost, converted to improved grasslands which are far more productive, but contain far fewer species. Heathland north of Llyn Llech Owain, Carmarthenshire Rough grazing land is included under rough grazing in the statistics above, and comprises a range of semi-natural vegetation types that are generally not cultivated or fertilised. There are large swathes of land dominated by purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea). This coarse and tussocky grass has low value for grazing, and thrives on wet, usually peaty soils in the uplands. It tends to be maintained by light grazing (usually by sheep), which inhibits the growth of trees and dwarf-shrubs like heather and bilberry, and promotes a species-poor plant community. Where grazing is reduced, boggy forms of heather moorland occur. The wettest of these vegetation types are termed mires, although most people would refer to them as bogs. Drier forms of vegetation dominated by ling (Calluna vulgaris) and heathers (Erica species) often with bilberry and a variety of other specialised herbs and shrubs are termed heaths. These once covered large areas of upland Wales, but are now somewhat fragmented, predominating on markedly acidic, shallow soils. Heathlands also occur to a lesser extent in lowland situations, often in association with gorse (on shallower acidic soils) and bracken (on deeper acidic soils). Coastal heathlands occur where cliff areas are fenced off from grazing stock, and wind exposure severely restricts tree growth. Calluna heaths have become a rarity in Europe, and are the subject of conservation efforts, aimed at maintaining their specialised biodiversity.  Woodland and forestry  Woodland is defined by Chambers English dictionary as \\"land covered with wood\\" i.e. dominated by tree species. Forestry is defined as \\"1. the science and art of planting, tending and managing forests; 2. Forest country\\". This implies that forests have been planted by mankind for a variety of purposes, but mostly for exploitation for timber and pulp for the paper industry. The majority of Forests in Wales were planted by the British Forestry Commission, a UK government agency. Since 2016 the Forestry Commission in Wales has been taken over by Natural Resources Wales (NRW). NRW publishes an annual report called \\"Woodlands for Wales indicators\\", which currently (February 2018) states that the area of woodland in Wales is now 306000 ha., comprising 156000 ha. of broadleaves, and 150000 ha of conifers. Thus, since the 2015 statistics quoted above, broadleaved woodland has overtaken coniferous forests in its coverage of Wales. thumb Typical upland forest plantations in central Wales The NRW provides a useful map of Welsh woodlands in its publication \\"Welsh woodlands ‚Äì their extent, nature and character\\". Most of the former Forestry Commission coniferous plantations are in the uplands at altitudes between 200 and 500 m. The highest mountains are beyond the tree-line, which is relatively low in Wales due to low summer temperatures, peaty soils and high wind speeds at altitudes above about 500 m. In recent years there has been some interest and research in the growing of fast-producing woodland crops like willow for biomass for energy production. As the Wales Energy Crops Information Centre points out, this process, using three-year rotations, is more akin to arable cropping than to forestry.  Arable land  Arable land, (from Latin arabilis, \\"able to be ploughed\\") is, according to one definition, land capable of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Wales it accounts for 13% of all agricultural land. Like the dairy industry, arable farming is restricted to the more productive areas. These are predominantly in lowland areas in the southeast, northeast, coastal regions and river valleys. Arable land near Monmouth In 2014 the rough breakdown of crops in Wales was: horticulture 60%, potatoes 20% and cereals 20%. Today (2018) there are small areas of specialist crops like oilseed rape (5080 ha in 2016) and linseed. There are several vineyards in Wales, especially between the Vale of Glamorgan and Monmouth.

He was highly successful, capturing a large number of English vessels which he sent back to his home ports in Martinique and Port Royal. Name and Identity Crapo‚Äôs real name is not known. He is referred to in various accounts as Clapo, Crepo, Crappo, Crapeau, or Crapo. This is an alias; ‚ÄúCrapaud‚Äù (‚Äútoad‚Äù in French) was a nickname given by English, Dutch and others to French sailors and eventually to the French people in general, evolving into ‚ÄúJean Crapaud‚Äù or ‚ÄúJohnny Croppo.‚Äù History Crapo appeared off New England in 1704 in his 10-gun, 150-ton, 120-man ship, capturing several vessels which he sent back to Martinique. Captured by the English, he was sent to Martinique with 63 other French sailors as part of an exchange for 75 English prisoners. The moment he was released in Martinique, he was given a new ship and immediately returned to privateering in the waters off New England. He menaced the coast again in early June 1705, taking prize ships near Sandy Hook. A captured English sailor joined Crapo‚Äôs French crew and offered to pilot them along the coast, giving them news of sailing schedules and potential targets. They put some prisoners ashore and ventured inland near Neversink where they burned two houses. Local officials fitted out a four-ship 350-man flotilla to hunt him down but Crapo escaped. In July a ship appeared off Boston with prisoners Crapo had released; some of their ships he‚Äôd sent back to Martinique, though he warned the prisoners he‚Äôd given them no quarter if he met them again. While he waited off the Virginia capes for slave ships inbound from Guinea, he sent his periagua to capture more English sloops in the area, brazenly looting their targets in sight of a local guard ship. The man-of-war attacked impotently, firing its guns ‚Äúto no purpose; they could not come up with him.‚Äù Later in July the same man-of-war caught Crapo and attacked again, this time forcing Crapo to abandon his ship and attempt to flee in the periagua. When the wind died the man-of- war was becalmed; Crapo‚Äôs ship was equipped with oars and was again able to escape. The immobile man-of-war send a pinnace to Crapo‚Äôs ship but - despite not being fired on by Crapo's ship - ‚Äúthey durst not venture to board her‚Äù and so returned empty-handed. Beginning in September 1705 Crapo used Acadia's Port Royal as a home port, which at one point had seven captured English vessels in its harbor at once. By June 1706 he was back in the Caribbean and may have joined a fleet commanded by Jean-Baptiste du Casse. In September 1706 he attacked an Irish vessel which fought back, killing and wounding over half of Crapo‚Äôs crew. Crapo and his ship were captured and sent back to Boston. By May 1708 Crapo had again been returned to Martinique, only to reappear off Sandy Hook and the Virginia Capes, where he captured four English vessels in quick succession. Released prisoners claimed Crapo was headed to Port Royal again to repair and recruit more crew, ‚Äúhaving but 40 white men and 15 negroes left on Board.‚Äù They also noted that the ‚ÄúPrivateer Sloop was built at Rhode-Island, and was call‚Äôd the Elizabeth.‚Äù That June he was back in action: ‚Äúone Crapeau in a privateer sloop from Martinico of four guns and about 70 men, took a ship from Liverpoole and a sloop from the West Indies.‚Äù There are no further records of his activities, but local officials lamented his success and expected his return: ‚ÄúThe knowledge this privateer hath gain'd of our coasts, and the success he has had, will in probability encourage him and others to visit us too often.‚Äù See also *Louis Guittar ‚Äì A French pirate active off the New England coast just a few years before Crapo.

Plot  Picking up from the prequel, the film starts off with Maariyappan aka Maari as the fun-loving gangster with his sidekicks Sanikkizhamai aka Sani (Robo Shankar) and Robert aka Adithangi ( punching bag). Maari is chased around by Araathu Aanandi, a \\"loosu ponnu\\" ( crazy girl) auto rickshaw driver who is head over heels in love with him. However, try as she might, Maari does not give her a second glance and constantly shows his annoyance to her. In a parallel storyline, Gangadhar Beeja is shown to have escaped from jail, after killing two police officers, with the cell walls scrawled with the words \\"Kill Maari\\". He is out for revenge, as his brother, who was a defence lawyer, promised to get Beeja released from jail. Unfortunately, his brother is killed at the hands of Maari as the former tried to molest Aanandi's elder sister. This is also the reason why Aanandi loves Maari. Maari gets his 100th murder attempt on his life by his rival Singayya, and to celebrate, Kalai, Sani, and Adithangi throw Maari a party. While coming back, Maari gets attacked, and Aanandi takes him to the hospital and takes care of him. Kalai's brother Vallavan is shown to be hand-in-glove with Singayya, who has formed an alliance with Beeja to overthrow Maari. As per Beeja's plan, Vallavan asks Sani to send Aanandi for a job, which turns out to be drug smuggling, a job which Maari hates. Aanandi goes to do the job and gets caught by Kalai. On confronting Aanandi, she tells him that Maari asked her to do it. This sparks doubt in Kalai's mind. Vallavan is caught by Maari carrying the drugs, and when Maari confronts Kalai, a fight erupts. Maari and his sidekicks set fire to all the drugs, and Beeja kills Vallavan to make it look as if Maari killed him. Kalai gets enraged and orders his men to kill Maari. Maari is injured in the battle, and Beeja reveals himself as the perpetrator. Beeja then shoots Maari, but Maari is saved by Aanandi, who took the bullet for him, which ended up in her lower spinal cord, paralysing her legs for life. The new collector, Vijaya Chamundeshwari IAS, comes out to restore order and stop all gang violence. Maari goes into hiding with Aanandi, whose legs are paralysed. Eight years pass, Beeja and Kalai have grown to become rich dons, but when Kalai has clear chance to become the MLA candidate of the ruling party, Beeja usurps that chance by threatening Kalai and his family. Vijaya, now the Deputy-Home secretary, in an effort to find Maari, posts his picture along with Aanandi's on newspapers. Maari sees this and meets Vijaya, requesting her to remove the photos. Maari then reveals that he was living in Tenkasi with an elderly couple. Aanandi got pregnant, and a healthy baby boy was born. However, due to complications by the paralysis, Aanandi dies minutes after childbirth. Maari then raises the boy, called Kaali (Master Raghavan) with help from the old couple and Sani. Kaali is shown to have inherited his father's behaviour and keeps picking fights in school. Maari then requests Vijaya to stop coming after him (as a request) and says that he changed his ways. When Kaali sees some students in the older grade teasing a teacher, he complains to the principal. In retribution, the boys chase him and try to teach him a lesson, only to get beaten black and blue by Kaali. The area member of council (Stalin), one of the boys' father, calls Kaali to hit him, but Maari goes and begs for forgiveness. Meanwhile, the city police commissioner mentions to the media that there is an informer within Beeja's gang. Using his moles in the police department, Beeja tries to figure out who the mole is but fails. It is then revealed that there was not any mole and that the whole story was fabricated to identify the corrupt policemen in the department, including the commissioner. Also, Beeja has been in ties with the commissioner and was the mole himself. He had been leaking info about his men so that he may come out clear to become an MLA candidate. It is also revealed that despite begging for forgiveness, the counsellor insisted on his son beating up Kaali, and so, Maari beats up the counsellor and his henchmen. In a final encounter, the police turns against Beeja. Maari fights Beeja and paralyses his legs for revenge for Aanandi and reveals to him that Maari killed his brother because Beeja could be killed by his own brother for property. Soon Beeja gets sentenced for life term prison. Maari is then shown with his sidekicks continuing his old life.

Horace C. Levinson's father was the noted Chicago lawyer Salmon Oliver Levinson. In 1909 the Society of Practical Astronomical was founded by two teenagers: Frederick Charles Leonard (1896‚Äì1960) as president and H. C. Levinson as treasurer. The Society was disbanded in 1917, but it played a significant role in the history of the American Association of Variable Star Observers. During World War I, Levinson was a lieutenant in the U.S. Army. In September 1922, Levinson received his Ph.D. in mathematical astronomy and pure mathematics from the University of Chicago with thesis The gravitational field of masses relatively at rest according to Einstein's theory of gravitation. In 1924 he was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in Toronto. During the 1930s, Horace C. Levinson began to apply scientific analysis for the problems of merchandising. His work for L. Bamberger and Company, involved, among other things, a study of customer buying habits, the response to advertising, and the relation of environment to the type of articles sold. In the 1920s, Levinson had completed a study for a mail-order house on the effect of speeded-up shipment on the customer acceptance or rejection of c.o.d. packages. His success in predicting general human reactions from the collection and analysis of great quantities of data led him later to initiate a study for Bamberger on the effectiveness, in terms of added sales, of keeping department stores open at night.

The Silvestris was the first new model from Spyker since it declared bankruptcy in 1929 and it hailed a return of the once prestigious brand. The Silvestris was hand built by Maarten de Bruijn, co founder of Spyker, and it debuted at the 1999 Goodwood Festival of Speed. The car is reportedly still owned by de Bruijn.  Performance  The Silvestris is powered by a 3,562 cc (3.5 L) Audi DOHC V8 producing 265 bhp (197.6 kW). Power is sent to the rear wheels through an Audi sourced 5-speed manual transmission. The Silvestris is built on a basic central monocoque made from galvanized sheet metal, with a tubular frame in the front and back, and features scissor doors. The car can do 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 4.5 seconds and is claimed to be able to reach 250 km/h (155 mph).  History  The Silvestris is the brainchild of Maarten de Bruijn, a town and country planner with experience in metal working. De Bruijn's dream was to start his own sports car factory, which led him to create the Silvestris. Before beginning on the project De Bruijn purchased all of the rights to the Spyker brand and logo for use on his car. The car debuted at the 1999 Goodwood Festival of Speed and was met with many positive reactions, notably from car collector and entrepreneur Victor Muller. Muller provided financial backing to bring the concept to production, becoming co-founder of the now reborn Spyker Cars alongside De Bruijn. With Muller's funding the Silvestris was developed into the Spyker C8 which debuted in 2000, a car which shared some styling cues and functional elements with the prototype but had undergone substantial changes in a variety of areas.

Her age at the time of her arrival is given variously as 17 or 18 years old.  Rochester strike  Ida Braiman and her father were participants in a citywide strike of the United Garment Workers of America only months after her arrival in the United States. On February 5, 1913, she was part of a group of strikers going to small textile factories encouraging workers their to join the strike. The strikers, a crowd of some seven hundred people, picketed a tailor shop owned by Valentine Sauter. When picketers began to throw stones, Valentine Sauter used a shotgun to fire into the crowd, killing Braiman and injuring three others. Although Sauter was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, a grand jury declined to indict him. Several strikers from the crowd were also arrested for rioting. 1913 Rochester Garment Workers' strike Braiman's death became a rallying point for the striking workers, and garnered support for the strike from middle- and upper-class women's suffrage organizers.

Anthony United States v. Susan B. Anthony was the criminal trial of Susan B. Anthony in a U.S. federal court in 1873. The defendant was a leader of the women's suffrage movement who was arrested for voting in Rochester, New York in the 1872 elections in violation of state laws that allowed only men to vote. Anthony argued that she had the right to vote because of the recently adopted Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, part of which reads, \\"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\\" The judge, Ward Hunt, was a recently appointed U.S. Supreme Court Justice who had responsibility for the federal circuit court in which the trial was held. He did not allow the jurors to discuss this case but instead directed them to find Anthony guilty. On the final day of the trial, Hunt asked Anthony if she had anything to say. Anthony, who had not previously been permitted to speak, responded with what one historian of the women's movement has called \\"the most famous speech in the history of the agitation for woman suffrage\\".Gordon (2005), pp. 7 Repeatedly ignoring the judge's order to stop talking and sit down, she protested what she called \\"this high-handed outrage upon my citizen's rights\\".Gordon (2005), p. 46‚Äì47 She also protested the injustice of denying women the right to vote. When Justice Hunt sentenced Anthony to pay a fine of $100, she defiantly said that she would never do so. Hunt then announced that Anthony would not be jailed for failure to pay the fine, a move that had the effect of preventing her from taking her case to the Supreme Court. Fourteen other Rochester women who lived in Anthony's ward also voted in that election and were arrested, but the government never took them to trial. The election inspectors who allowed the women to vote were arrested, tried and found guilty. They were pardoned by President Ulysses S. Grant after being jailed for refusing to pay the fines imposed by the court. The trial, which was closely followed by the national press, helped make women's suffrage a national issue. It was a major step in the transition of the women's rights movement from one that encompassed a number of issues into one that focused primarily on women's suffrage. Judge Hunt's directed verdict created a controversy within the legal community that lasted for years. In 1895, the Supreme Court ruled that a federal judge could not direct a jury to return a guilty verdict in a criminal trial. Background=Early demands for women's suffrage= The demand for women's suffrage grew out of the broader movement for women's rights, which began to emerge in the U.S. in the early 1800s. There was little demand for the right to vote in the movement's early days, when the focus was on such issues as the right of women to speak in public settings and on property rights for married women. At the first women's rights convention, the Seneca Falls Convention held in western New York in 1848, the only resolution that did not pass unanimously was the one that called for women's suffrage. Originated by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was just beginning her career as a suffrage leader, the resolution was adopted only after Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist leader and a former slave, gave it his strong support.Wellman (2004), pp. 193, 195, 203 That convention helped to popularize the idea of women suffrage, and by the time of the first National Women's Rights Convention in 1850, suffrage was becoming a generally accepted part of the movement's goals.DuBois (1978) p. 41 Women began to attempt to vote. In Vineland, New Jersey, a center for radical spiritualists, nearly 200 women placed their ballots into a separate box and attempted to have them counted during the 1868 elections, but without success. Lucy Stone, a leader of the women's rights movement who lived nearby, attempted to vote soon afterwards, also without success.DuBois (1998), pp. 119‚Äì120. It had not always been illegal for women to vote in New Jersey, whose 1776 constitution enfranchised all adult inhabitants, male or female, who owned a specified amount of property. New Jersey women were disenfranchised by a law passed in 1807. See Wellman (2004), p. 138 =New Departure strategy= In 1869, Francis and Virginia Minor, husband and wife suffragists from Missouri, developed a strategy that became known as the New Departure, which engaged the suffrage movement for several years. This strategy was based on the belief that the recently adopted Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, together with the pending Fifteenth Amendment, implicitly enfranchised women. The primary purpose of these amendments was to establish the newly freed slaves as citizens with voting rights. In the process of doing so, these amendments defined citizenship in a way that clearly included women, prohibited the states from abridging \\"the privileges or immunities of citizens\\", and transferred partial control over voting rights from the state to the federal level. The Minors cited Corfield v. Coryell, a case in 1823 in which a federal circuit court ruled that voting rights were included in the privileges and immunities of citizens. They also cited the preamble to the Constitution to support their assertion that the basic rights of citizens were natural rights that provided the foundation for constitutional authority. According to the New Departure strategy, the main task of the suffrage movement was to establish through court action that these principles taken together implied that women had the right to vote.DuBois (1998), pp. 98‚Äì99 In 1871 Victoria Woodhull, a stockbroker with little previous connection to the women's movement, presented a modified version of the New Departure strategy to a committee of Congress. Instead of asking the courts to rule that the Constitution implicitly enfranchised women, she asked Congress to pass a declaratory act to accomplish the same goal. The committee rejected her proposal.DuBois (1998), pp. 100, 122 In early 1871, the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) officially adopted the New Departure strategy. It encouraged women to attempt to vote and to file federal lawsuits if denied that right.DuBois (1998), p. 100 The NWSA, organized by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1869, was the first national women's rights organization. A rival organization called the American Woman Suffrage Association, which was created a few months later, did not adopt the New Departure strategy but instead campaigned for state laws that would enable women to vote.DuBois (1998), p. 120 Soon hundreds of women attempted to vote in dozens of localities.DuBois (1998), p. 119 Accompanied by Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist leader and a supporter of women's rights, sixty-four women unsuccessfully tried to register in Washington, D.C. in the spring of 1871, and more than seventy attempted to vote.Gordon (2000), p. 526, footnote 4 In November 1871, the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia ruled against lawsuits brought by these women. It ruled that citizenship did not imply the right to vote, saying that \\"the legal vindication of the natural right of all citizens to vote would, at this stage of popular intelligence, involve the destruction of civil government\\" and that \\"The fact that the practical working of the assumed right would be destructive of civilization is decisive that the right does not exist.\\"Cox, Rowland (ed.), \\"The American Law Times\\", The American Law Times Association (1871), Vol 4, pp. 199‚Äì200 Arrest and conviction for voting=Vote in 1872 election= The reaction of the authorities was muted in these unsuccessful attempts to vote. The reaction was sharply different when Susan B. Anthony succeeded in voting in the presidential election of 1872 in Rochester, New York. Anthony was a nationally known figure. She and Stanton had founded the Women's Loyal National League, the first national women's political organization in the U.S., in 1863 during the American Civil War. Anthony was the chief organizer of the League's petition drive against slavery, which collected nearly 400,000 signatures in the largest petition drive in U.S. history up to that time.Barry (1988), p. 153Venet (1991), p. 148. She and Stanton were the leaders of National Woman Suffrage Association. At the time when she cast her ballot, Anthony was the nation's best-known advocate of the right of women to vote.Anthony was the nation's \\"best-known advocate of woman suffrage\\" per Gordon (2005), p. 1. Ann D. Gordon is the editor of the six-volume Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Similarly, Ellen Carol DuBois, an historian of the women's suffrage movement, said that at this time Anthony \\"was the most famous women suffragist in the nation\\", per DuBois (1998) p. 129 John Van Voorhis On November 1, 1872, Anthony walked with her sisters Guelma, Hannah, and Mary to a voter registration office in a nearby barber shop and demanded to be registered. Anthony quoted the Fourteenth Amendment to the election inspectors to justify their demand and threatened to sue the inspectors personally if they refused. The inspectors consulted a prominent local lawyer, John Van Voorhis (a strong supporter of women's suffrage), who advised them to register the women after they took the standard oaths of registry, which, he said, \\"would put the entire onus of the affair on them.\\"Quoted in Barry (1988), p. 250 A skilled publicist, Anthony then went to a newspaper office to provide an interview about what had just happened.Gordon (2005), p. 33 News of the women's registration appeared in the afternoon newspapers, with some of them calling for the arrest of the inspectors who had registered the women. Anthony returned to the voter registration office to ask the inspectors to stand firm and to assure them that she would cover any legal costs they might incur. Other women in Rochester began to register, bringing the total to nearly fifty.Barry (1988), pp. 249‚Äì51 On election day, November 5, Anthony and fourteen other women from her ward went to the polling place to cast their ballots. Sylvester Lewis, a poll watcher, challenged their right to vote, thereby triggering a requirement that they take an oath stating that they were qualified to vote, which they did. The election inspectors were now in a difficult position. They were at risk of violating state law if they turned the women away because state law did not give them the authority to refuse the ballot to anyone who took the required oath. Federal law, however, made it illegal to receive the ballot of an ineligible voter. Moreover, federal law prescribed the same punishments for accepting the ballot of an ineligible voter as for refusing the ballot of an eligible voter. The inspectors decided to allow the women to vote.Gordon (2005), pp. 1‚Äì2, 29‚Äì30. After she voted, Anthony wrote to her friend Elizabeth Cady Stanton, saying, \\"Well I have been & gone & done it!!‚Äîpositively voted the Republican ticket‚Äîstrait.\\" That letter is archived at the Huntington Library, which provides a digital scan of Anthony's letter. The negative publicity of the previous days had influenced the officials in the other wards, who turned the other registered women away. =Arrest= Anthony had not expected to vote, according to Ann D. Gordon, a historian of the women's movement. Instead, she had expected to be turned away from the polls, after which she planned to file a suit in federal court in pursuit of her right to vote. She didn't expect to be arrested either.Gordon (2005), pp. 2, 61 On November 14, warrants for the arrest of the women who had voted and the election inspectors who had allowed them to do so were drawn up and shown to the press. William C. Storrs, one of the commissioners for the U.S. Circuit Court for the Rochester area, sent word to Anthony asking her to meet him in his office. Anthony replied that she \\"had no social acquaintance with him and didn't wish to call on him.\\"Gordon (2000), pp. 531‚Äì533, footnote 1 On November 18, a deputy U.S. Marshal came to her house and said that Commissioner Storrs wished to see her in his office. When Anthony asked why, the officer replied that Storrs wanted to arrest her. Anthony said that men weren't arrested that way and demanded to be arrested properly. The deputy then produced the warrant and arrested her. Told that she was required to go with him, Anthony replied that she wasn't prepared to go immediately. The deputy said he would go on ahead, and she could follow when she was ready. Anthony said she would refuse to take herself to court, so the deputy waited while she changed her dress. Anthony then held out her wrists to be handcuffed, but the officer declined, saying he did not think that would be necessary. Henry R. Selden The other fourteen women who had voted and were subsequently arrested were: Charlotte (\\"Lottie\\") B. Anthony, Mary S. Anthony, Ellen S. Baker, Nancy M. Chapman, Hannah M. Chatfield, Jane M. Cogswell, Rhoda DeGarmo, Mary S. Hebard, Susan M. Hough, Margaret Garrigues Leyden, Guelma Anthony McLean, Hannah Anthony Mosher, Mary E. Pulver, and Sarah Cole Truesdale. The election inspectors who had allowed them to vote were arrested also. Their names were Beverly Waugh Jones, Edwin T. Marsh and William B. Hall.Gordon (2005), pp. 28‚Äì29. Brief biographical information about each of the women can be found in Gordon (2000), pp. 528‚Äì529. Several of the women were involved in various types of reform activity. DeGarmo had been the recording secretary for the Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848, the second such convention in the country, held two weeks after the Seneca Falls Convention.Flexner, Eleanor (1959), Century of Struggle, p. 158. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. As her attorney, Anthony chose Henry R. Selden, a respected local lawyer who had previously served as lieutenant governor of New York and as a judge on the New York Court of Appeals. The New York Commercial Advertiser said that Anthony's trial had taken on new importance now that Selden had agreed to take her case, and it suggested that men might need to reconsider their opinion on women's suffrage. Anthony also frequently consulted the lawyer for the election inspectors, John Van Voorhis, who had previously served as Rochester City Attorney.Gordon (2005), pp. 30‚Äì31 The women who were arrested were held to $500 bail. Everyone posted bail except Anthony, who refused.Gordon (2005), pp. 11‚Äì12 Storrs issued a commitment authorizing the U.S. marshal to place her in the Albany County jail, but she was never actually held there.Gordon (2005), pp. 4, 12, 37 =Pre-trial speaking tour= Anthony's arrest generated national news, which she turned into an opportunity to generate publicity for the suffrage movement. She spoke in 29 towns and villages of Monroe County, New York, where her trial was to be held and which would provide the jurors for her trial. Her speech was entitled \\"Is it a Crime for a U.S. Citizen to Vote?\\"Major excerpts of this speech are in Gordon (2005), pp. 63‚Äì68. The complete speech is in Volume 2 of the History of Woman Suffrage, pp. 630‚Äì647 She said the Fourteenth Amendment gave her that right, proclaiming, \\"We no longer petition Legislature or Congress to give us the right to vote. We appeal to women everywhere to exercise their too long neglected 'citizen's right to vote'\\".Gordon (2005), p. 67 She quoted to her audiences the first section of the recently adopted Fourteenth Amendment, which reads: > All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the > jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State > wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall > abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor > shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without > due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal > protection of the laws. Anthony then argued that, > The only question left to be settled now, is: Are women persons? And I > hardly believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood to say they are > not. Being persons, then, women are citizens; and no State has a right to > make any new law, or to enforce any old law, that shall abridge their > privileges or immunities.\\"Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1887), p. 638 Her speech was printed in its entirety in one of the Rochester daily newspapers, which further spread her message to potential jurors. She drew attention to the inconsistent way that gendered words were used in the law. She pointed out that the New York tax laws referred only to \\"he\\", \\"him\\" and \\"his\\", yet taxes were collected from women. The federal Enforcement Act of 1870, which she was accused of violating, similarly used male pronouns only. Her official record of commitment was written with masculine pronouns, but the Clerk of the Court had inserted an \\"s\\" above \\"he\\" in the printed form to make it into \\"she\\", and similarly had altered to \\"his\\" to \\"her\\". She said, \\"I insist if government officials may thus manipulate the pronouns to tax, fine, imprison and hang women, women may take the same liberty with them to secure to themselves their right to a voice in the government.\\"Gordon (2005), p. 37 =Other pre-trial activity= On January 21, 1873, at a hearing before the U.S. District Court in Albany, the capital of New York state, Selden presented detailed arguments in support of Anthony's case. He said the question of the right of women to vote had not been settled in the courts and therefore the government had no basis for holding Anthony as a criminal defendant. Without giving U.S. Attorney Richard Crowley a chance to make the government's case, Judge Nathan K. Hall ruled that Anthony would remain in custody.Gordon (2005), p. 4 Anthony published Selden's arguments before this court as a pamphlet and distributed 3000 copies, some of which she mailed to newspaper editors in several states with requests to reprint them.Gordon (2005), p. 34 In the letter that accompanied her request to the publisher of the Rochester Evening Express, she asked for help in convincing people that her vote was not a crime, saying, \\"We must get the men of Rochester so enlightened that no jury of twelve can be found to convict us.\\", published on the web by the University of Rochester Library. The site of Anthony's trial: Ontario County Courthouse, Canandaigua, NY On January 24, Crowley presented the proposed indictments to the grand jury at the District Court in Albany, which indicted the women voters. Anthony again pleaded not guilty and was held on bail for $1000. Selden posted Anthony's bail over her protest.Gordon (2005), p. 5Barry (1988), pp. 252‚Äì253 On March 4, Anthony voted once again at an election in Rochester. This time, however, she was the only woman to do so. At an arraignment on May 22, Crowley requested the transfer of the case from the federal district court to the federal circuit court for the Northern New York District, which had concurrent jurisdiction. A session of this circuit court would meet in June in Canandaigua, the county seat of Ontario County, which borders on Monroe County. No reason for the move was given, but observers noted that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ward Hunt was assigned to that circuit and would be available in June to try the case. Federal circuit courts often held important cases until the arrival of the assigned Supreme Court justice, whose participation would give the verdict greater weight. The transfer also meant that jurors would not be drawn from Monroe County, which Anthony had thoroughly covered with her recent speaking tour on women's right to vote.Gordon (2005), p. 68 Anthony responded by speaking throughout Ontario County before the trial began with the assistance of her colleague Matilda Joslyn Gage. =Trial= Justice Ward Hunt, a U.S. Supreme Court justice, presided over the trial in the federal Circuit Court, Northern District of New York. The trial had several complications. Anthony was accused of violating a state law that prohibited women from voting, but she was not tried in a state court. Instead she was tried in federal courts for violating the Enforcement Act of 1870, which made it a federal crime to vote in congressional elections if the voter was not qualified to vote under state law.Gordon (2005), p. 39 Her case was handled by two overlapping arms of the federal court system: the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York and the U.S. Circuit Court for the Northern District of New York. (This circuit court system was abolished in 1912.) Justice Ward Hunt, who had recently been appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, had responsibility for that circuit and was the judge in this trial. Hunt had never served as a trial judge. Originally a politician, he had begun his judicial career by being elected to the New York Court of Appeals.Hull (2012), pp. 115‚Äì116, 158 The trial, United States v. Susan B. Anthony, began on June 17, 1873, in Canandaigua, New York, and was closely followed by the national press. The case was being viewed as having some farcical aspects, and the press was ready for more. The New York Times reported that, \\"It was conceded that the defendant was, on the 5th November, 1872, a woman.\\" Justice Hunt presided alone, which was contrary to established practice. Federal criminal trials at that time normally had two judges, and a case could not be forwarded to the Supreme Court unless the judges disagreed about the verdict. District Court Judge Nathan K. Hall, who had already been involved with Anthony's case in earlier court actions, served beside Judge Hunt during trials earlier that day, and he was on the bench with Hunt when Anthony's case was called. He did not remain there during Anthony's trial, however, but instead sat in the audience.Gordon (2005), pp. 9‚Äì10, 26 Also in the audience was former president Millard Fillmore.Gordon (2005), p. 26 Legal arguments  Arguing for the defense, Selden said the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment made it clear that women were citizens and that states were prohibited from making laws that abridge \\"the privileges and immunities of citizens\\". Therefore, he said, women were entitled to all the rights of citizens, including the right to vote, the right that gives meaning to the other political rights. He cited examples of wrongs suffered by women in cultures all over the world partly because they had no voice in government. He said that Anthony voted in the sincere belief that she was voting legally and therefore could not be accused of knowingly violating a law.Gordon (2005), pp. 41‚Äì43 Arguing for the prosecution, Crowley said the \\"privileges and immunities\\" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to such rights as life, liberty and property, not the right to vote. He said that children were citizens, but no one would claim they had the right to vote. He cited recent state and federal court decisions that had upheld the right of states to restrict suffrage to males. He pointed out that the second section of the Fourteenth Amendment specifically referred to male voters when it stipulated reduced representation in Congress for states that restricted male suffrage.Gordon (2005), pp. 44‚Äì45. Commenting on the fact that the wording of Fourteenth Amendment could be used for such opposite purposes, historian Ellen Carol DuBois said that, \\"the universalities of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, where federal citizenship is established, run headlong into the sex-based restrictions of the second section, where voting rights are limited.\\" See DuBois (1998) p. 117. Through her attorney, Anthony requested permission to testify on her own behalf, but Hunt denied her request. Instead he followed a rule of common law at that time which prevented criminal defendants in federal courts from testifying.Gordon (2005), pp. 5, 13 Directed verdict After both sides had presented their cases on the second day of the trial, Justice Hunt delivered his written opinion. He had written it beforehand, he said, to ensure that, \\"there would be no misapprehension about my views\\". The text of Hunt's instructions to the jury can also be found in Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1887), beginning on page 675. He said the Constitution allowed states to prohibit women from voting and that Anthony was guilty of violating a New York law to that effect. He cited the Slaughter-House Cases and Bradwell v. Illinois, Supreme Court rulings made only weeks earlier that had narrowly defined the rights of U.S. citizenship. Furthermore, he said, the right to a trial by jury exists only when there is a disputed fact, not when there is an issue of law. In the most controversial aspect of the trial, Hunt ruled that the defense had conceded the facts of the case, and he directed the jury to deliver a guilty verdict. He denied Selden's request to poll the jury to get their opinions on what the verdict should be.Gordon (2005), pp. 6‚Äì7, 15‚Äì17, 48‚Äì50 These moves were controversial because the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution begins with the words, \\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury\\". N. E. H. Hull, a law professor who wrote a book-length study of this trial, commented on Justice Hunt's delivery of an opinion that Hunt said he had prepared earlier. Hull said, \\"Whether that meant he had written out his opinion before the trial commenced or whether he waited to hear if any arguments or evidence on that first day might influence his decision, one will never know.\\"Hull (2012), p. 150 After the trial, Anthony was outspoken in her belief that Hunt had written his verdict before the trial had begun. Van Voorhis, an attorney who had assisted Anthony, agreed, saying that Hunt had, \\"unquestionably prepared his opinion beforehand\\".Harper (1898‚Äì1908), Vol. 1, pp. 444, 441 The participants later voiced disagreement about what the jury's verdict would have been had there not been a directed verdict. U.S. Attorney Crowley said the jury had informally agreed to Hunt's verdict.Gordon (2005), p. 70 Anthony told a different story. The History of Woman Suffrage, which she co-edited, reported that one of the jurors said, \\"The verdict of guilty would not have been mine, could I have spoken, nor should I have been alone. There were others who thought as I did, but we could not speak.\\"Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1887), p. 689 Anthony's speech to the court On the second day and final day of the trial, in what is ordinarily a routine move, Hunt asked Anthony if she had anything to say. She responded with \\"the most famous speech in the history of the agitation for woman suffrage\\", according to Ann D. Gordon, a historian of the women's movement.Gordon (2005), pp. 7, 45‚Äì47 Repeatedly ignoring the judge's order to stop talking and sit down, Anthony protested what she called \\"this high-handed outrage upon my citizen's rights\\", saying \\"you have trampled under foot every vital principle of our government. My natural rights, my civil rights, my political rights, my judicial rights, are all alike ignored.\\" She castigated Justice Hunt for denying her a trial by jury. She also declared that even if he had allowed the jury to discuss the case, she still would have been denied her right to a trial by a jury of her peers because women were not allowed to be jurors. She said that in the same way that slaves obtained their freedom by taking it \\"over, or under, or through the unjust forms of law,\\" now for women to get their right to a voice in government, they must \\"take it; as I have taken mine, and mean to take it at every possible opportunity.\\" Blocked path to Supreme Court When Justice Hunt sentenced Anthony to pay a fine of $100, she responded, \\"I shall never pay a dollar of your unjust penalty\\"Gordon (2005), p. 47 and she never did. If Hunt had ordered her to be jailed until she paid the fine, Anthony could have filed a writ of habeas corpus to gain a hearing before the Supreme Court. Hunt instead announced he would not order her taken into custody, closing off that legal avenue. Because appeals to the Supreme Court in criminal court cases were not permitted at that time, Anthony was blocked from taking her case any further.Gordon (2005), p. 18 =Attempt to collect Anthony's fine= A month after the trial, a deputy federal marshal was dispatched to collect Anthony's fine. He reported that a careful search had failed to find any property that could be seized to pay the fine. The court took no further action.Gordon (2005), p. 7 =Peripheral legal action=Election inspectors' trial The trial of the election inspectors who had allowed Anthony and the other fourteen women to vote was held immediately after Anthony's trial. The inspectors were found guilty of violating the Enforcement Act of 1870 and fined. They refused to pay their fines and were eventually jailed. There was public sympathy for the inspectors, who had been in a no-win situation, facing adverse legal action if they allowed the women to vote and also if they turned them away. The Rochester Evening Express said on February 26, 1874, \\"The arrest and imprisonment in our city jail of the Election Inspectors who received the votes of Susan B. Anthony and the other ladies, at the polls of the Eight Ward, some months ago, is a petty but malicious act of tyranny.\\"Quoted in Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1887), p. 714 The jailed inspectors received food, coffee and a steady stream of visits from their supporters, including the women whom they allowed to vote. Anthony appealed to her friends in Congress for their release, and they in turn appealed to President Ulysses S. Grant, who pardoned the men on March 3, 1874. The inspectors were reelected to their offices in elections that were held on that same day.Gordon (2005), p. 8 Women voter codefendants The fourteen women who had been arrested with Anthony were indicted in January, 1873. On May 22, they were released on their own recognizance after U.S. Attorney Crowley announced that Anthony's case would be made into a test case. They were informed that they did not need to appear at Anthony's upcoming trial. On June 21, 1873, after Anthony's trial, the prosecutor entered motions of nolle prosequi in the circuit court to signal that the government would not pursue their case any further.Gordon (2005), pp. 13, 29 =Press coverage= Caricature of Susan B. Anthony in the Daily Graphic just before her trial The Associated Press provided daily reports of the trial that were printed in newspapers across the country. In some cases, newspapers filled several columns with the arguments prepared by the lawyers and with the judge's rulings. Some newspapers were harshly critical of the women voters. The Rochester Union and Advertiser said their action, \\"goes to show the progress of female lawlessness instead of the principle of female suffrage\\" and that \\"the efforts of Susan B. Anthony & Co. to unsex themselves and vote as men will be so far as they are successful both criminal and ridiculous.\\"Quoted in Gordon (2005), pp. 35‚Äì36 The primary topic of interest was Judge Hunt's refusal to allow the jury to deliberate and vote on a verdict. The New York Sun called for Hunt's impeachment, saying that he had overthrown civil liberty.Gordon (2005), p. 36 The Trenton State Sentinel and Capital asked, \\"Why have juries at all if Judges can find verdicts‚Äîor direct them to be found, and then refuse to poll the jury?\\" Quoted in Gordon (2005), p. 69 Shortly before the trial began, the New York Daily Graphic ran a full-page caricature of Anthony on its front cover with the title \\"The Woman Who Dared\\". It depicted Anthony with a grim expression and wearing men's boots with spurs. In the background was a woman in a police uniform and men carrying groceries and babies. The accompanying story said that if Anthony were acquitted at the trial, the world would come to resemble the cartoon, and women would \\"acknowledge in the person of Miss Anthony the pioneer who first pursued the way they sought.\\" Quoted in Gordon (2005), p. 33 Aftermath=Petition for remission of fine= In January 1874, Anthony petitioned Congress to remit her fine on the grounds that Judge Hunt's ruling had been unjust. The judiciary committees of both the Senate and the House debated the question. Senator Matthew Carpenter condemned Justice Hunt's ruling, saying that it was \\"altogether a departure from, and a most dangerous innovation upon, the well-settled method of jury-trial in criminal cases. Such a doctrine renders the trial by jury a farce. [Anthony] had no jury-trial, within the meaning of the Constitution, and her conviction was, therefore, erroneous.\\" Benjamin Butler brought a bill to remit Anthony's fine to the floor of the House, but it did not pass. =Effect on the women's movement= The trial of Susan B. Anthony helped make women's suffrage a national issue. It was a major step in the transition of the women's rights movement from one that encompassed a number of issues into one that focused primarily on women's suffrage.Hewitt (2001), p. 212 The National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) continued to pursue the New Departure strategy even though Anthony had been blocked in her attempt to bring her voting rights case before the Supreme Court. Virginia Minor, one of the originators of the New Departure strategy, succeeded in that effort. When Minor was prevented from registering to vote in Missouri in 1872, she took her case first to a state circuit court, then to the Supreme Court of Missouri, and finally to the U.S. Supreme Court. Unfortunately for the suffrage movement, in 1875 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Minor v. Happersett that the Constitution did not implicitly support women's suffrage, stating that \\"the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone\\".Gordon (2005), pp. 18‚Äì20 The Happersett decision put an end to the New Departure strategy of trying to achieve women's suffrage through the courts. The NWSA decided to pursue the far more difficult strategy of campaigning for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would ensure voting rights for women. That struggle lasted for 45 years, until the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1920. Supreme Court rulings did not establish the connection between citizenship and voting rights until the mid-twentieth century, with such decisions as Reynolds v. Sims and Wesberry v. Sanders, both in 1964. =Continuing debate over directed verdicts= The controversy within the legal community over Justice Hunt's directed verdict continued for years. In 1882, a month after Justice Hunt's retirement from the Supreme Court, a circuit court judge ruled that it was wrong for a judge to direct a jury to deliver a verdict of guilty. In 1895, in Sparf v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that a federal judge could not direct a jury to return a guilty verdict in a criminal trial. =Other outcomes= In April 1874, Anthony published a book of more than 200 pages called An Account of the Proceedings on the Trial of Susan B. Anthony, on the Charge of Illegal Voting, at the Presidential Election in Nov., 1872, and on the Trial of Beverly W. Jones, Edwin T. Marsh, and William B. Hall, the Inspectors of Election by Whom Her Vote was Received. It contained documents from the trial, including the indictments, her speech to potential jurors, the attorneys' arguments and motions, the trial transcripts, and the judge's ruling. It did not include the argument of U.S. Attorney Crowley because he refused to provide it. Instead, Crowley published his own pamphlet that contained his argument together with the judge's ruling. Anthony's book also contained an essay written after the trial by John Hooker, the reporter for Connecticut's Supreme Court of Errors, which said that Hunt's actions were \\"contrary to all rules of law\\" and \\"subversive of the system of jury trials in criminal cases.\\"Gordon (2005), p. 34‚Äì36 Helen Potter's notations for imitating Susan B. Anthony's speech to the court.Potter's notations are explained in her book beginning on this page. Helen Potter, a popular entertainer, performed reenactments of Anthony castigating the judge for years after the trial. A skilled impersonator of famous people, Potter performed across the country.Gordon (2005), p. 45 Anthony traveled to see Potter on stage in Illinois in 1877. After the performance (which did not include Anthony's speech), Potter signaled her support for Anthony's work by paying her hotel bill and donating $100 to her.Gordon (2003) pp. 296‚Äì297 The arrested women and some of their supporters formed the Women Taxpayers' Association of Monroe County in May 1873 to protest their situation of taxation without representation.Gordon (2005), p. 29 The place where the arrested women voted now has a bronze sculpture of a locked ballot box flanked by two pillars, which is called the 1872 Monument, and was dedicated in August 2009, on the 89th anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment. Leading away from the 1872 Monument there is the Susan B. Anthony Trail, which runs beside the 1872 Caf√©, named for the year of Anthony's vote. On August 18, 2020 President Donald Trump pardoned Susan B. Anthony on the 100th Anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Legal commentary In the summer of 1874, the Albany Law Journal, the leading legal journal in New York state, criticized Judge Hunt's actions, saying, \\"Miss Anthony had no trial by jury. She had only a trial by Judge Hunt. This is not what the constitution guarantees.\\"Quoted in Gordon (2005), p. 36 In 2001, the New York University Law Review published an article called \\"A Revolution Too Soon: Woman Suffragists and the 'Living Constitution'\\", which included a section on Anthony's trial. Its author, Adam Winkler, said the dominant mode of constitutional interpretation in the twentieth century, sometimes known as \\"Living Constitutionalism\\", is generally said to have originated around 1900 with such legal thinkers as Oliver Wendell Holmes, who believed that the constitution should be interpreted in ways that meet the present needs of society. Winkler points out, however, that the suffragists' New Departure strategy preceded those thinkers by urging the courts to declare that women's right to vote was a newly recognized natural right that was inherent in the constitution. \\"10 Trials that Changed the World\\", a group of articles published in 2013 in the ABA Journal (an organ of the American Bar Association), included an article called \\"Susan B. Anthony is Convicted for Casting a Ballot\\". Its author, Deborah Enix-Ross, chair of the ABA's Center for Human Rights, said the trial touched on many issues other than women's suffrage, \\"including the laws that supported Reconstruction, the competing authority of federal and state governments and courts, criminal proceedings in federal courts, the right to trial by jury and the lack of provisions to appeal criminal convictions.\\" She said that, \\"Justice Hunt's decision to direct the jury to find Anthony guilty‚Äîwithout allowing the jurors to deliberate and without polling them‚Äîwas so egregious that lawyers, politicians and the press spoke out against his violation of the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury.\\" She also said, \\"Anthony's role in providing impetus for protecting a defendant's rights in jury trials should not be overlooked.\\" See also * Timeline of women's suffrage in the United States * Women's suffrage organizations ReferencesBibliography * Anthony, Susan B.

Description  Isaac Smith Osterhout willed a substantial portion of his estate for the establishment of a free public library. In 1887, the board of directors hired Melvil Dewey, creator of the Dewey decimal system, to act as an adviser. Dewey recommended that the board buy the First Presbyterian Church, an edifice built in 1849, and use it for approximately 10 years until permanent arrangements could be made. As it happened, this became the permanent arrangement. The Gothic architecture of the church proved quite suitable for a library. The library trustees hired Hannah Packard James to be the first head librarian and assigned her the task of organizing and preparing the library for its grand opening. The original library collection (approximately 10,000 volumes) consisted of books from Osterhout‚Äôs personal collection, part of the Atheneum (a local subscription library), and 9,500 volumes purchased from Charles Scribner and Sons. The Osterhout Free Library finally opened its doors to the public on January 29, 1889 and was one of the first libraries in Northeastern Pennsylvania.https://osterhout.info/about/history/Article on Osterhout Home Page Founded in 1986, the Luzerne County Library System (LCLS) is an organization that administers ten libraries in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.

Initially interested in developing her talents as an illustrator and animator, she later turned to fashion, graduating from the Danish Design School. After training with John Galliano in Paris and Alexander McQueen in London, she established her own label in 2011 and presented her first collection at London Fashion Week the following year. Early life and education Madsen was brought up in Ringe in central Funen where she completed her school education. Although she showed an early interest in fashion after seeing a collection designed by Jean Paul Gaultier in one of her mother's magazines, on matriculating from high school, she first attended art college where she trained to become an illustrator. Thereafter, she contributed illustrations to magazines and children's books and joined an animation class at the National Film School of Denmark as a guest student. In 2002, she went on to study at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, intending to develop her skills in animation and storyboarding. It was not until her final year that she decided to specialize in fashion, earning a bachelor's degree from the Academy's Design School in 2005. In 2006, Madsen received practical training in Paris where she deepened her understanding of materials while at Peclers, a trend-setting agency. Still in Paris, she then spent a few months as an intern with John Galliano who was then Dior's head designer. In May 2007, she returned to Denmark to study for a master's degree at the Design School. Career In the summer of 2007, Madsen was offered a job as a junior designer with the London-based designer Alexander McQueen. She quickly found out the working conditions were really tough, sometimes forcing her to work until the early hours when preparing for shows. After spending a year in London, she quit McQueen, returned to Denmark to complete her master's degree, and set about establishing her own business. In August 2011, Madsen held her first fashion show during Copenhagen Fashion Week. She was particularly happy when Hamish Bowles of Vogue came up to her backstage and congratulated her on her collection. By the end of 2012, she had not only built up a design team in Copenhagen but had opened stores in New York and Miami. In 2014, she presented her first ready-to-wear fashions in Paris, where she has returned every year since. The same year, her collection was also presented in St. Petersburg, London and New York. By 2014, the Danish Design Museum had selected some of her creations for their permanent collection. Awards In October 2013, Madsen won the Dansk Design Talent award which was presented by Princess Mary for the five fashion designs she had created for the Danish singer Oh Land. In 2015, she won the DHL Exported award for the collections she was to show in Tokyo.

(Original description) The shortly fusiform shell has a short siphonal canal. It is smooth and shining. It is yellowish-while, with more or less conspicuous traces of red-brown streaks on rihs. The shell contains 7 whorls, of which a little more than one forms a convex, smooth protoconch. The subsequent whorls are separated by a deep, waved suture. They are convex, angular and slightly excavated at their upper part. They show rather strong, rounded, oblique, axial ribs (11 on the body whorl), those behind the peristome stronger. These ribs are pointedly tubercled about their median part, just below the excavation in upper whorls and at the shoulder of the body whorl. On this latter the ribs are fainter towards the base, otherwise the shell is nearly smooth, but for very faint, remote spirals, a little more conspicuous on the siphonal canal, and fine growth lines. The aperture is oval, angular above, with a wide, short siphonal canal below. The peristome is thin, broken, with a shallow sinus above.

On 14 August 1942, surrounded by German soldiers whilst she and her colleague Natalya Kovshova had only two grenades left, they set off the last two grenades, killing themselves and surrounding German soldiers. For their bravery she and Kovshova were posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 14 February 1943.  Civilian life  Polivanova was born to a working Russian family in the Tula Governorate on 24 October 1922. After graduating from secondary school she worked at the National Institute of Aviation Technologies in Moscow with her friend Natalya Kovshova, who also dreamed of becoming an aircraft designer.  Military career  Polivanova joined the Red Army in June 1941 after the start of the Second World War, training to become a sniper. In October 1941, she was put in the 3rd Moscow Communist Rifle Division, a Narodnoe Opolcheniye group to defend Moscow from German bombing attacks. In January 1942 she was transferred to the 528th Rifle Regiment on the Northwestern Front and received training at the Central Women's Sniper Training School. Both Polivanova and Kovshova established themselves as skilled snipers and respected instructors in the battalion. In February 1942, Polivanova was sent to the front, fighting for control of Novaya Russa. In doing so the unit was able to disable enemy machine-gun setups and positions. In the battle of Rutchevo, under heavy enemy fire she managed to carry many wounded soldiers from her unit to safety. Some time between March and May 1942 she was wounded in battle and taken to a field hospital, where Kovshova was sent only two days later. In August 1942, the unit was deployed on an to offensive Sutoki-Byakovo. Not long into the battle the commanding officer was killed, so Kovshova took command of the unit. Polivanova served as Kovshova's spotter. When the German troops began their counterattack, she gave the command to open fire on them. The Germans realized there were snipers in the area, so they launched a barrage of mortar fire. When the fire stopped one soldier asked to retreat, Kovshova replied with the famous phrase \\"Not one step back!\\" Casualties piled up on the Soviet side, leaving only three snipers alive, one of whom was too injured to continue fighting and the other two were Polivanova and Kovshova, who were injured but continued fighting. When they started to realize they were running low on ammunition while German forces were drawing closer and closer, Polivanova and Kovshova kissed before making their last stand, detonating the last of their grenades, killing themselves and surrounding German troops.

Career Tony Tooke began his career in the U.S. Forest Service in 1980, at the age of 18, on the National Forests in Mississippi. In 1993 he became a Forest Service line officer. His field experience includes assignments as a \\"Timber Management Assistant\\", a position usually responsible for the execution of a program to produce a specified amount of timber each year. His next career steps included being an \\"Other Resource Assistant\\", and a Silviculturalist (an individual who is responsible for timber harvesting and reforestation plans). He eventually became a Forester on six Ranger Districts, including districts in Kentucky and Mississippi, managing the growth of different trees and monitoring their health. From there he moved on to become District Ranger at the Talladega National Forest in Alabama, the Oconee National Forest in Georgia, and the DeSoto National Forest in Mississippi. After that, he served as Deputy Forest Supervisor for the National Forests in Florida. =Washington positions= Since 2006, Tony Tooke also held increasingly senior positions in the Forest Service's Washington Office (WO). In September of that year, he took over the position of Assistant Director for Forest Management. In this function, he became closely acquainted with questions of ecological restoration, climate change, and integrative vegetation management. Since March 2009, he served as Deputy Director for Economic Recovery. In December 2009, he became the Director for Ecosystem Management Coordination, where it was his job to manage the lands and resources of the National Forest System. Tooke's official USDA portrait His last position in Washington, D.C., before becoming Service Chief, was Associate Deputy Chief for the National Forest System. In this capacity, he oversaw numerous work areas of the Forest Service, including the Lands and Realties the agency has been entrusted with, but also less obvious aspects such as Minerals and Geology. Furthermore, his obligations included the oversight of cooperation efforts with state rural development councils through the National Partnership Office as well as the coordination of ecosystems management and the Forest Service‚Äôs efforts for the conservation of wilderness areas and wild scenic rivers. In addition, he also was responsible for oversight of bureaucratic necessities such as Business Administration and Support Services. As Associate Deputy Chief, Tooke was also in charge of the Forest Service‚Äôs programs for Environmental Justice and the implementation of the 2014 Agricultural Act, commonly known as the \\"Farm Bill\\", which helps the Forest Service to accomplish some of its core missions, such as ecological restoration and reducing risks of wildland fires. Yet another facet of Tony Tooke's work was to implement the Forest Service's strategy to improve the agency's awareness of the state of its inventory, as well as the work of its usually widely dispersed employees, and the implementation of a new planning rule for the National Forest System. =Atlanta positions= After Tooke's assignment in the WO, he became Regional Forester for the Forest Service's Southern Region, also known as Region 8, headquartered in Atlanta, GA. The Southern Regional Office manages forests and lands of 13 States as well as Puerto Rico. In a ceremony at White Mountain National Forest on September 2, 2017, Tooke took an oath of office from the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, thereby making Tooke the 18th Chief of the U.S. Forest Service. New Hampshire's Governor, Chris Sununu, and members of the US Forest Service also attended the ceremony. Tooke succeeded the longtime Chief of the Forest Service Thomas Tidwell. The new Chief took over an agency that oversees 154 national forests, as well as 20 grasslands in 43 states and Puerto Rico. One of his premier tasks will be to lead the fight against wildland fires which consume more than half of the Forest Services financial resources, topping $2 billion in 2017. The agency, as Tooke said in a statement in September 2017, also appreciates the help it receives from Congress to develop more effective tools for firefighting. Another task for the person in this position will be to manage U.S. public forests effectively and to cooperate well with authorities on both state and local levels. =Sexual Misconduct= On March 2, 2018, the U.S. Forest Service confirmed that the United States Department of Agriculture has \\"engaged an independent investigator\\" to evaluate charges of sexual misconduct and harassment against Tooke, including retaliation against those who complained about him.

Man (November 30, 1893 ‚Äì January 30, 1985) was a photographer and later an art collector. Original version. In particular, he was a leading pioneer photojournalist, especially for Picture Post. Life Man was born in Freiburg, Breisgau, Germany. After finishing school in Freiburg im Breisgau, from 1912 he studied art and art history in Munich and Berlin. His studies were interrupted by the First World War. He took part in WWI as an officer and began to take photographs at the front. Here he undertook his first reporting for Ruhe an der Westfront. In 1918 at the end of WWI, he resumed his studies in Munich and continued in Berlin. In Berlin in 1927, Man started work as an illustrator and graphic designer for the BZ newspaper and for Tempo. From 1928, he was employed by the Deutscher Photodienst (Dephot), for which he worked from 1929 under the pseudonym \\"Man\\". His reportages appeared under this pseudonym in the M√ºnchner Illustrierte Presse, where he met Stefan Lorant. During 1929 to 1932, he created 110 photo reports, such as his photo essay A day in the life of Mussolini from 1931. Man toured North Africa, Canada, and the Canadian Arctic, from where he delivered his photo reports for the Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. In 1933, he returned to Berlin and received no work permit because he refused to enter the Reichspressekammer and so he emigrated to England in May 1934. His 41 picture reports, produced between 1929 and 1935 in Canada, continued to be published in the Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. After his emigration in 1934, he met Stefan Lorant in London, where he was editor of the refounded Weekly Illustrated and within six months published 47 image reports. He then moved to the Daily Mirror, where he remained until 1938, to then work under the direction of Stefan Lorant as a chief photographer at Picture Post, with 100‚Äì150 annual photo reports. He also worked for Life and The Sunday Times. In 1948, the Picture Post began printing colour pages and was also groundbreaking in the field of colour image reporting, and along with Tim N. Gidal, pioneered colour photography in photojournalism. After the Second World War, Man began to collect lithographs and in 1953 published 150 years of artists' lithographs 1803‚Äì1953 and one year later Eight European Artists. During the years 1959‚Äì1971, he lived in Switzerland and then in Rome, Italy, where he worked for The World. In 1977, he participated in the documenta 6 quinquennial contemporary art exhibition, held in Kassel, Germany. His photo reports moved away from juxtaposed single images and so he is considered an innovator of European photojournalism. His work on the history of lithography is also significant. During his career, Man took portrait photographs of leading political and cultural figures such is Clement Attlee, William Beveridge, Ernest Bevin, Sir Stafford Cripps, T. S. Eliot, Oskar Kokoschka, David Lloyd George, John Masefield, Henry Moore, Paul Nash, George Orwell, Dame Sybil Thorndike, and Evelyn Waugh, some of which are in the National Portrait Gallery, London. The gallery also holds a photograph of Man himself by Roger George Clark, daing from 1983. The lights go up in London, a 1945 photograph by Man, is held in the Tate collection.

The series ran for 12 episodes. NotesReception Anime News Network had five editors review the first episode of the anime: Nick Creamer found the humor \\"too mild and one-note\\" to illicit any laughter and the characterization of Kohane and Arima feeling \\"underwritten\\" but gave credit to the aesthetic work of both the backgrounds and facial expressions, and the jokes having effective sound design to emphasize them; Theron Martin was mixed about Kohane's overall character, saying she can be grating at times and misinterpret things heard but admired her for having tons of enthusiasm and heart to be proactive in conquering her fears and being a motivational voice towards Arima's low self-worth as a cheerleader; James Beckett was critical of Kohane's obnoxious persistence to make friends with Arima and start a cheerleading club but felt that character quirk will be fixed in later episodes to deliver on both its slice-of-life and sports content with decent cheerleading animation and cutesy antics, saying it will be \\"perfectly acceptable candy-coated fluff\\" for its target audience; Paul Jensen agreed with Beckett's sentiments towards Kohane's overly upbeat personality being an annoyance and criticized the repetitious and over- explanation of its characters throughout the episode. The fifth reviewer, Rebecca Silverman, also echoed what both Beckett and Jensen said about Kohane but was optimistic that she'll grow up into a more tolerable character as the series continues, concluding that \\"In the meantime, this feels like a slightly more exciting Cute Girls Doing Cute Things show than we normally get; in fact, it may be a full-out sports show, although I'm inclined to think it'll land somewhere in the middle. The animation for the dancing looks smooth and the characters are all distinct and distinctly cute, so if you can handle Kohane's constant barrage, this episode makes it look like Anima Yell! could be very appealing.\\" ReferencesExternal links Anime series based on manga Cheerleading television series Doga Kobo Houbunsha manga Sports anime and manga Seinen manga Yonkoma ","title":"Anima Yell!"},{"id":"56405080","text":"The Tuscola County Courthouse is a government building located at 440 North State Street in Caro, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. History Tuscola County was established in 1840 as part of Saginaw County, but in 1850 was authorized to establish its own county government. Vassar was selected as the first county seat, but a prolonged dispute over the location, begun in 1860, ended with Caro being designated the county seat in 1867. An unused church building was moved into Caro to serve as the first courthouse until 1872, when a new stone-and-brick courthouse was erected.> By the 1920s, the 1873 courthouse was considered too small, and in 1926 voters approved a one mill tax to raise $300,000 to fund a new courthouse. In 1931 a building committee was established, which reviewed multiple proposals, accepting plans from Detroit architect William H. Kuni. Contractors were hired, and demolition of the old courthouse and construction of the new one began in 1932. The building was completed in 1933, and continues to serve the county. Description The Tuscola County Courthouse is a rectangular, two-story, Art Deco building measuring 120 feet by 75 feet. The exterior walls are steel frame faced with Indiana limestone on a granite- faced foundation. The facade has a central mass with slightly lower wings to each side which project slightly forward. The grounds are nearly level with the entryway, which is reached via a six-step staircase. The main block contains five vertical bands of windows separated by projecting piers. Windows are square-headed on the first floor and round-arched on the second. The piers support an entablature which reads \\"TUSCOLA - COUNTY - COURT - HOUSE\\" The interior is reached through a recessed entryway, which leads into a vestibule and then the lobby. A stair accesses the second-floor lobby and the courtroom. In the public spaces, the floors are terrazzo and the walls are pink marble. A tinted and stained glass window fills the broad and tall arched window in the rear wall behind the main staircase's mid-level landing.

He belonged to the school of Italian neo-idealist thinkers, among a group of artists and writers who made Trieste of the early Twentieth Century a notable center of intellectual activity. Fano read and interpreted the work of Benedetto Croce and Giovanni Gentile from an original point of view. In particular, he recognized the importance of the natural sciences and mathematics, which in his system are not pseudo-concepts. He also stressed the major importance of the simplest and most basic aspects of the life of mind, inspired by reflections of Gianbattista Vico.  Biography  Giorgio Fano was born in Trieste on April 17, 1885. His father Guglielmo was a well-known physician, his mother Amalia Sanguinetti, who for many years was seriously ill, died when he was still a child. His father Guglielmo was one of the few Jews at the time who had converted to Catholicism out of sincere belief in the faith. But this conversion was, unfortunately, accompanied by religious delusions and mental disorders. = Youth and interaction with the Julian intellectuals = As an adolescent, Fano was rebellious against adult authority, detesting their conformity, their oppressive spirit and the ponderous atmosphere that enveloped them. In the novel Novel \\"Quasi una fantasia\\" by Ettore Cantoni, Publisher Sellerio, edited by Bruno Maier (1994).\\"Quasi una fantasia\\" (Almost as a phantastic story) by Ettore Cantoni there is talk of two boys, in which it is easy to recognize the author Ettore and his friend Giorgio Fano, who travel and even arrive in Africa, precisely to escape the environment established by adults. A rebellious boy, he refused to accept school discipline. In one notable episode typifying his character, he threw the class register into fire. He attended Austrian schools of the time, but with little benefit. One part of his difficulties was the fact that he did not have a retentive memory. Although he excelled in understanding conceptual principles, he was deficient in retaining the numerous trivial details necessary in the study of history and geography. Thus, he left his studies long before he had achieved the matura (high school degree). Indeed relates on Il Piccolo of January 4, 1995: \\"Retired‚Äù from school, his relatives got him a good office job. But he abandoned the job, without saying anything to anyone and rented, along with some peers, a small room on the hill of Scorcola. There he devoted himself not only to endless discussions with friends (and perhaps some amorous diversions) but also spent hours and hours reading, without any external guidance and while taking a large volume of notes, the classics of philosophy. Ill-fed, cold and often sleep-deprived‚Äîjust fami . . . freddi o vigilie (hunger, cold and vigils), as Dante had expressed it. His in-depth study of the classics continued later in Vienna, where he could also attend the lectures of some academic luminaries of the time. It was his reading of the German classics, from Leibniz to Schopenhauer‚Äîand, in particular, Kant, Fichte and Hegel‚Äîwhich provided the basic orientation of his lifelong philosophical thinking. Even with the undoubted originality of his own oeuvre, he would retain this viewpoint throughout his lifetime. And we should not neglect the fact that his great fascination for the major exponents of German criticism and idealism provided him with conceptual weapons for his personal battle against the dogmatism, fideism, clericalism, inhabiting his own family environment. In any event, this young rebel, often reckless in his decisions concerning practical affairs, often unresponsive to people he did not like, showed from the outset, on matters of philosophical thought, a seriousness, a prudence, a desire to explore and document deep questions, to an extent which is rarely found even in mature scholars today.\\" The exceptionally stimulating environment of Trieste at the time also contributed to Fano‚Äôs personal and intellectual maturation. In particular, he was friend of Umberto Poli, for whom he created the pseudonym ‚ÄúSaba.‚Äù In the above account by Giorgio Voghera also contains the following passage which describes the type of relationship that existed between Saba and Fano: \\"Fano was an incurable optimist, jovial and fearless; his jokes sometimes embarrassed Saba. His vision of the world was somehow transformed into something more beautiful and elevated, although he was often rather na√Øve. The following episode, known to be authentic, shows the kind of bold jokes Fano often subjected his friend. Young Fano and Saba are walking along the seashore, in an animated discussion about the existence of God. At one point Fano collects, and conceals in his closed fist, a piece of wood. He announces: \\"If God exists, let this stone float!\\" and then throws the piece of wood into the sea, in which it naturally remains afloat. Saba, very excited, thinking this might possibly be a miracle, brings his hand to the heart and exclaims breathlessly: \\"My God, Giorgio, Giorgio ...\\" \\" The sixth of the \\"Prigioni\\"Book of Umberto Saba \\"Il canzoniere\\". of Saba is also inspired by the figure of Fano: The passionate. / Nature, because I burn, it has covered my cheeks and the red-haired chin. The spirit is not a breeze: it is a rushing wind, so even the Fate is shaken. /...../ I was Moses who brought you from Egypt, / and I suffered for you on the cross. / They call me in Arabia Muhammad. Saba and Fano together bought the Ancient and Modern LibraryIn 1919 it was sold to Giorgio Fano and Umberto Poli, the future poet Umberto Saba, who on 12 September 1919 became the only owner of the Library. They did not regard it in the same way, while Saba was a lover of ancient books, Fano had a more indifferent outlook. Fano was not a person to diligently take on many \\"boring\\" tasks, but rather cheerfully consigned them to his companions. Ultimately, the two decided to separate, and leave the library to only one of them. Since both wanted to remain owners, Fano proposed a decision with a coin toss; Fano won. But Saba did not want to accept the verdict of fate and desperately begged his friend to leave him the Library; Fano eventually gave in.Silvano Lantier: Il pensiero di Giorgio Fano , il linguaggio tra filosofia e scienza, Universit√† degli studi di Trieste, Facolt√† di Magistero, N.S.18, p. 12 (1976). Another person from the Trieste area with whom Fano had a close friendship was . Fano writes: \\"Our meeting was like that of a Tuscan artist with a Jewish prophet. I was very happy with it. At that time Giotti was reading Zola, Maupassant and Flaubert, works not familiar to Fano. Because of his indolent character, in many peripheral aspects of life he did what I advised him. He came away from Trieste, then he brought his family to Florence, and the like.\\" But the friendship between the two suffered a tremendous trauma due to the tragic events involving Maria, sister of Virgilio Giotti, who Fano married in 1913. They had a mentally impaired son, who was later killed by his mother, who afterward committed suicide.Anna Fano book \\"Giorgio e io\\",Un grande amore nella Trieste del primo '900 by Guido Fano. Editor \\"Gli specchi Marsilio\\". p. 314. This tragedy deeply shook the entire Trieste social community. He married a second time with Anna Curiel; together they had a son named Guido. = Studies and teachings = During the period of the First World War, Fano was irredentist, like many of his friends, , Saba, Giotti, and others. Later his attitude was very similar to that of Benedetto Croce, and for similar ideological reasons. He did not espouse egalitarian ideals, which appeared to him as utopian and, in any case undesirable, possibly leading to a Communist society. Indeed, in the years immediately following the First World War, he firmly opposed the maximalist and turbulent socialism of that time. This resulted, for a very brief period, in some sympathy for Fascism. But this attitude changed very quickly, even before Croce. Giorgio Fano became a courageous and unconditional antifascist, who lost no opportunity to openly express his opinions. These position statements were not without consequences; in this regard we cite Treccani from the Biographical Dictionary: Professor of Philosophy at various high schools in Trieste since 1925, Fano aspired, however, to university teaching, which encountered many obstacles imposed by the authorities. These difficulties were the result of his antifascist reputation, including a speech that he delivered commemorating his cousin Enrico Elia, a volunteer in the Great War who died in Podgora in 1915. In this speech he expressed, in a not very subtle way, the belief that the sacrifice of many lives for freedom was denied by the then dominant political regime. This political assertion earned him a few days in jail in the fortress of Koper and his reputation as an antifascist continued to have negative effects on his university career. Fano graduated in philosophy cum laude from the University of Padua in 1923, with a thesis with the original title \\"Of the universe or of myself: essay of a solipsistic philosophy.‚Äù The thesis was published in 1926 in the Rivista d'Italia. He did not attend university classes in Padua, probably in part, because he was already married and had to provide for his family. In addition to Florence, an significant fraction of his university education was gained in Vienna, where he had spent a few years before the war, immersed in the environment of La Voce.Environment of \\"La Voce\\" in Biographical Dictionary of Italians, Rome, Institute of the Italian Encyclopaedia. Voghera writesBook of Giorgio Voghera \\"Gli anni della psicanalisi\\", Ed. Studio Tesi, Pordenone, First edition (1980) pp. 154-156. \\"Of great maieutic skills [resembling the Socratic method of eliciting new ideas from others], it is no wonder that he was a teacher of particular value: the best I have ever known, I would dare to say. In Trieste he lectured for a few years in high schools, before moving to Rome. But some of my peers who had him as a teacher, never ceased to tell me the surprise they experienced when, after listening to Fano, suddenly realizing that philosophy‚Äîthat indigestible jumble of empty, abstruse and complicated concepts‚Äîbecame something extremely fascinating and current, even fun. Needless to say, all the pupils were enthusiastic about him and almost all the schoolgirls were in love with him.\\" Fano was scholar of Croce, whom he had known since 1912; he published various articles on Croce's philosophy.Aesthetics in the system of B. Croce, L'Anima, December 1911; the philosophy of B. Croce, Giornale critico della filosofia italiana, 1928. One of these articles, entitled The Negation of Philosophy in Current Idealism (1932), brought him to the attention of , who offered him a position as voluntary pedagogical assistant at the Faculty of Magisterium of the Sapienza University of Rome. Thus, Fano moved there with his new family. The first book in which his thoughts were explicitly formulated: The Dialectical System of the Spirit appeared in 1937, when he was already 52 years old. In 1938, because of the racial laws then in effect, he was turned away from a university teaching position; he succeeded nevertheless in continuing as a professor at the Military School of Rome. = Later years and research on the origin of language = After the German invasion on September 8, 1943, Fano found refuge in Rocca di Mezzo in Abruzzo, where he remained for almost a year. His quiet serenity, courage and heedlessness of danger never failed him, although constantly faced with the risks of being discovered by the Germans (he and his wife had falsified their identity cards) and of the Allied bombing raids. Indeed, during the long winter of 1943-44, the Germans often relied on him as an interpreter. Since his house was right on the main road, the kitchen was often full of soldiers who needed something. There, in that poorly-heated kitchen, indifferent to the fearsome risks, he worked perhaps more diligently than ever before and completed an important work: The Philosophy of Croce. Essay of Criticism and Early Features of a Dialectical System of the Spirit, which was published in 1946. We recount here an episodePersonal memory of his son Guido Fano.Book of Anna Fano \\"Noi ebrei\\", Istituto giuliano di storia, cultura e documentazione , p. 47 (1993). that succinctly epitomizes both the importance that he attached to his work and his temerity and courage, one might almost call it his unconsciousness: One morning, coming down into the kitchen, which had become his studio, he found it invaded by German soldiers who were looking for water and more. And then, with his usual calm demeanor, indifferent to the fact that he was a Jew, with the face of a biblical prophet, he pointed the Wehrmacht soldiers to the door: \\"Please,\\" he said in German, \\"gentlemen, please, can you go somewhere else. I would have to work.‚Äù Without a word the soldiers pushed the door open and left, and Giorgio quietly went back to his work table to resume his arguments with Croce. He was quite fortunate that even a most superficial investigation would have been enough to convoy him with his family to the extermination camps.\\" When the war ended, he resumed his position at the University of Rome, and for a brief period he also held a temporary appointment as director of the Institute of Pedagogy of the Magisterium. However Fano did not ever bother to obtain any official appointment to an academic position, so that, when his academic career ended, he was not entitled to receive even a minimum pension. Notwithstanding, he had worked continuously for almost twenty years until his death, producing a number of highly relevant essays. In the aforementioned essay on Croce, he had advocated the importance of the empirical sciences, which in Croce's philosophy were ascribed no cognitive dignity. In the text Eastern Theosophy and Greek Philosophy, we find a description of the historical development of human thought, emphasizing the importance of mathematics, in contrast to Croce‚Äôs claim that mathematics was merely a \\"pseudo-concept.‚Äù His later research concerned the question regarding the origin of language. He contributed some significant original insights on the subject, as elaborated in his Essay on the Origins of Language; with a Critical History of the Glottogonic Doctrines. The essay was later expanded, following his intentions, into a more extensive exposition, the book Origins and Nature of LanguageThe text was translated into English by Susan Petrilli and published by Indiana University Press under the title \\"The Origins and Nature of Language\\",1992. by his wife Anna and son Guido.

She showed very promising form as a juvenile in 1928 when she won three of her four races including the Dewhurst Stakes. In the following year she finished third in the 1000 Guineas and went on to win the Epsom Oaks, Coronation Stakes and Jockey Club Stakes. She had some success as a broodmare producing the top-class winner Bobsleigh and Hydroplane, the dam of Citation. Background Toboggan was a bay mare bred in the United Kingdom by her owner Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby. She was sent into training with Frank Butters at his Fitzroy House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was ridden in most of her races by Tommy Weston. She was from the seventh crop of foals sired by the unbeaten champion, Hurry On, making her a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line. Apart from Toboggan, Hurry On sired numerous major winners including Captain Cuttle, Coronach, Call Boy, Precipitation and Pennycomequick. Toboggan's dam Glacier was a half-sister to Canyon who won the 1000 Guineas and was the dam of Colorado. Racing career=1927: two-year- old season= As a two-year-old in 1927 Toboggan finished third in a maiden race at Kempton Park Racecourse on her debut and then won the Champion Breeders Foal Plate at Derby Racecourse. In autumn at Newmarket Racecourse Toboggan was matched against male opposition won the Boscawen Plate. In the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at the same track she won again and won at odds of 4/9 despite carrying a seven pound weight penalty. Toboggan ended the season with earnings of ¬£3,528. =1928: three-year-old season= On 4 of May Toboggan contested the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. She finished third of the fourteen runners behind the King's filly Scuttle, who started the 15/8 favourite. At Epsom Racecourse on 8 of June Toboggan faced Scuttle again in the 150th edition of the Oaks Stakes and started at odds of 100/15 (approximately 6.7/1) in a thirteen-runner field. Toboggan took the lead at least six furlongs from the finish, steadily increased her advantage in the straight and came home four lengths clear of Scuttle with a gap of six lengths back to Flegere in third place. Toboggan was dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. Starting at odds of 11/10 she won from Scuttle and Romany Queen. On 4 October Toboggan was matched against older horse in the Jockey Club Stakes over fourteen furlongs at Newmarket. She won by two lengths from four-year-old colt Bonny Bay at odds of 3/1. At the end of the season Lord Derby explained that both Toboggan and his leading colt Fairway had been succefully subjected to a process of \\"electric light treatment\\". In the 1928 season, Toboggan won ¬£21,522. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Toboggan a \\"superior\\" winner of the Oaks and the best filly of her generation trained in Britain or Ireland. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Toboggan was retired to become a broodmare for Lord Derby's stud. She produced at least eight foals between 1930 and 1941: *Moccasin, a filly, foaled in 1930, sired by Phalaris *Bobsleigh, chestnut colt, 1932, by Gainsborough. Won Richmond Stakes and Newmarket Stakes. *Pendola, filly, 1933, by Felstead *Colours Flying, bay filly, 1934, by Gainsborough *Mont Angel, colt, 1937, by Fairway *Hydroplane, chestnut filly, 1938, by Hyperion.

It was settled in 1836 and has been continuously owned by the same family since that time. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. History Lovira Hart Farm c. 1883 Lovira Hart grew up in Mount Morris, New York. In late 1836, Lovira and his wife's brother, John Abbey, traveled to Tuscola County and purchased land. They were some of the first European settlers in the area. In 1837 Hart constructed a log cabin and returned to New York to bring his family. In mid-1837 Lovira, his wife Hannah Emeline, and their family moved to this location in Michigan. However, in 1841 Hannah Emeline died in childbirth, leaving Lovira with four young children. Lovira Hart remarried in 1842, to Esther Maria Parker; the couple had three more children. Lovira Hart became involved in local government and politics, serving as Tuscola Township Supervisor in 1844, 1846, 1851, and 1857, as Township Treasurer in 1850, and he was elected Tuscola County's first County Judge in 1850. He also built one of the township's first schools in 1850. Hart constructed the farmhouse on the property between 1848 and 1852, when the family moved in. A well house and barn were built some time later. The farmstead was substantially upgraded in 1880, with an addition to the house and the construction of several outbuildings. Lovira Hart died in 1892, passing the farm down to his descendants. Additional buildings on the property were constructed through the first half of the 20th century. Description The Lovira Hart, Jr., and Esther Maria Parker Farm complex straddles Hart Road, and includes a farmhouse with multiple outbuildings. The house is of post and beam construction on a stone foundation. It is a front gable Greek Revival Upright and Wing structure with a two-story upright and single story wing. A single-story addition is located at the rear. There is a small covered front porch on the wing section, supported by two square columns, sheltering the entry door which is symmetrically flanked by two windows. The house is clad with clapboard, now covered with vinyl siding. Greek Revival detailing includes the low-pitched roofs, cornice returns, symmetrical placement of the windows, and the wide band of divided trim along the cornice line of the upright. Outbuildings in the complex near the house include: an 1852 gable- roof wellhouse, a 1920 concrete block ash house, a 1920 garage, a 1942 hog cot, and a 1910 hog barn with a gambrel roof. Across the road there are more buildings, including a pre-1880 horse and buggy barn, a windmill and watering trough shed, a large 1870 gambrel roof barn, two milk houses, a silo, corn crib, chicken coop, and tool barn.

He collected his first song, Bushes and Briars, from Mr Charles Pottipher, a seventy-year-old labourer from Ingrave, Essex in 1903, and went on to collect over 800 songs, as well as some singing games and dance tunes. For 10 years he devoted up to 30 days a year to collecting folk songs from singers in 21 English counties, though Essex, Norfolk, Herefordshire and Sussex account for over two thirds of the songs in his collection. He recorded a small number of songs using a phonograph but the vast majority were recorded by hand. He was a regular contributor to the Folk Song Society's Journal, a member of the society's committee from 1904 to 1946, and when in that year the society amalgamated with the English Folk Dance Society he became president of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, a position he held until his death.Palmer, Roy (ed.); Bushes and Briars - Folk Songs Collected by Ralph Vaughan Williams; Llanerch; 1999 pp vii-xxiiiRoud Folk Song Index https://www.vwml.org/search?ts=1492461835806&collectionfilter;=RoudFS;RoudBS&advqtext;=0crVaughan%20Wil Retrieved 2017/04/17EFDSS Full English Project; https://www.vwml.org/vwml- projects/vwml-the-full-english/vwml-full-english-collectors/vwml-ralph- vaughan-williams Retrieved 2017/04/17 Vol. 2 no 8 of the Journal of the Folk Song Society was dedicated to 61 songs collected by Vaughan Williams from singers in Essex, Norfolk, Sussex, Wiltshire, Yorkshire, Kent and London.Journal of the Folk Song Society vol.2 no. 8 https://archive.org/details/journaloffolkson02folk Retrieved 2017/04/17 Book 2 of Cecil Sharp's series \\"Folk Songs of England\\", titled \\"Folk-songs from the eastern counties\\" published in 1908, consisted of 15 songs from Vaughan William's collection, from Essex, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire.Folk-songs from the eastern counties; https://archive.org/details/folksongsfromeas00vaug Retrieved 2017/04/17 Eight Traditional English Carols was published in 1919, and Twelve Traditional Carols From Herefordshire, written with song collector Ella Mary Leather in 1928. \\"The Penguin Book Of English Folk Songs\\" edited by Vaughan Williams and A L Lloyd was published in 1959 and \\"A Yacre Of Land: Sixteen Folk-songs From The Manuscript Collection Of Ralph Vaughan Williams\\" by Imogen Holst and Ursula Vaughan Williams was published in 1961.

The text of one song, The Long Whip, seems to have been lost completely as a result. Vaughan Williams knew that the texts of many of the songs he was preserving had been printed as broadsides and he sometimes used broadside texts to fill out his songs for publication. He did not bowdlerise the material he collected for publication, as some other collectors did, but was as much as they were forced to recognise the constraints of the time when it came to publishing \\"unsuitable\\" material. Sometimes too he failed to note singers' names or occupations.

All 38 passengers and crew were killed in the crash which occurred when one of the engines failed due to icing during initial climb out. At the time, the crash was the second worst in the history of the Yakovlev Yak-40 which had entered operational service with Aeroflot just ten years prior. Aircraft and flight The Yak-40 involved in the accident, registration CCCP-87437, had entered service in 1974 and had just shy of 6,300 operating hours on the airframe by the time of the accident. Flight 1080 was being operated by the Kazakh Civil Aviation Administration under Aeroflot. It had 34 passengers, which included four children, and four crew on board during the flight of 7 October 1978. The crew consisted of two pilots, a flight mechanic, and a stewardess. It was flying a domestic flight from Sverdlovsk-Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg, Russia to Kostanay Airport in northern Kazakhstan. On the night of the accident, the sky was cloudy and there were light rainy conditions in addition to an air temperature of 5 ¬∞C. Accident At 19:48 YEKT on 7 October 1978, Aeroflot Flight 1080 commenced its takeoff roll on runway 26 at Sverdlovsk-Koltsovo Airport. Due to the presence of a crosswind and the fact that the aircraft was loaded beyond its maximum weight capacity, it took off at a speed of 205 km/h (110 kn). At 19:50, the crew reported to air traffic control that its left engine had failed. Just one hundred meters off the ground, the aircraft began turning to the left. At 19:51, controllers observed a flash and a fire on a forested hillside close to the airport. The aircraft had struck trees while it was still 23 meters (75 ft) in the air and struck the ground shortly after, destroying the airframe and detaching the flight's tail and rear stabilizers. All 38 people aboard Flight 1080 were killed in the catastrophe. Investigation The Soviet State Research Institute of Civil Aviation accident commission determined the crash to be the fault of the crew. The aircraft was loaded beyond its specified limits consequently requiring additional thrust on takeoff. The crew failed to take into account icing conditions which were present at the time of the accident and as a result all three engines had been effected by a buildup of ice, resulting in the left engine failing shortly after takeoff and the right and middle producing insufficient levels of power. The commission also cited air traffic control's failure to point out nearby terrain after giving the aircraft clearance to turn left after takeoff at an altitude of just one hundred meters as a contributing factor to the accident.

He was also an official of the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). During the 1960s he was a member of the politburo's \\"Ideology Commission\\", widely regarded as one of the most committed and effective propagandists among East Germany's mainstream academic historians. His publications and political engagement after reunification reflected a continuing commitment to East German-style communism.  Life  Berthold was born in Hindenburg (as Zabrze had been renamed after 1914). Hindenburg was a substantial manufacturing city in Upper Silesia: the 1921 plebiscite had identified it as a predominantly German-speaking city, albeit by a narrow margin. Lothar Berthold's father worked as a customs official. After completing his school final exams (Abitur) at a relatively young age, in 1943/44 he became a Luftwaffenhelfer (loosely: \\"air defence assistant\\"). In 1944 he was enrolled into the National Labour Scheme. Before the end of the year he had been conscripted into the army. He was briefly a member of the Nazi Party. By the time the war ended, in May 1945, he had already been promoted to a junior officer rank. The ending of the war brought industrial scale ethnic cleansing to Silesia followed by frontier changes. Berthold found himself relocated to the central portion of Germany, administered now as the Soviet occupation zone. Communist Party membership was no longer outlawed, and early in 1946 he became a youthful member of the re-emerging Communist Party of Germany. He was actively involved in the contentious party merger which led, in April 1946, to the launch of the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), quickly signing his party membership over to the newly united - albeit effective as such only in the Soviet zone - \\"party of the left\\". Comrades attest that it was as a result of the education reforms in the emerging communist German state that he was able, almost immediately, to enroll at the Friedrich Schiller University at Jena where he studied History, German studies and Philosophy between 1946 and 1950, emerging with a degree and a Level I teaching qualification. In October 1949 the Soviet occupation zone had been relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany), seen by critics as a new kind of German one-party dictatorship, with the SED as its ruling party. Berthold worked between 1950 and 1952 as a research assistant at the party's Karl Marx Academy, located at that time just outside Berlin. The focus of his work was on the history of the German labour movement and, more specifically, on the development of the Communist Party in Germany. In 1952 he added a teaching position at the academy to his research work. He received his doctorate in 1955 for a piece of work (subsequently published as a book) on Communist Party history. In 1960 he passed his habilitation (higher academic qualification) which opened the way to a lifelong academic career. The same year he was appointed to a professorship at the academy. In 1962 he was appointed to as position at the Party Central Committee's Institute for Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, initially as head of the Department for the History of the Labour Movement. He also served, between 1962 and 1964, as a deputy president of the institute. He was promoted in 1964, becoming the institute's president in succession to Roland Bauer. Along with this position, which Berthold held for the next four years, he was appointed a member of the politburo's influential \\"Ideology Commission\\". Along with his responsibilities at the institute, between 1962 and 1968 Berthold was editor in chief of \\"Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung\\", an academic journal focusing on the history of the labour movement, a topic of considerable importance for the national leadership. In 1967 the eldest of the Bertholds' three daughters, Erika-Dorothea, became friendly with Florian Havemann, whose father, Robert Havemann was one of the country's most high-profile (and intellectually brilliant) political dissidents. The crushing of the Prague Spring movement in August 1968 through an invasion by fraternal tanks from around the Warsaw Pact caused unease at many levels in East Germany, but most people kept their doubts to themselves. Nevertheless, a number of young people, including some of the adolescent children of East German intellectuals, such as Thomas Brasch, Florian Havemann and his girl-friend, Erika-Dorothea Berthold, expressed their opposition to the Warsaw Pact intervention through a series of street protests in Berlin. They also painted the name \\"Dubcek\\" on walls and distributed leaflets spelling out their concerns. After slightly less than three months in investigatory custody, the young people faced trial between 21 and 28 October 1968 and were condemned to prison terms or, in the case of Florian Havemann who was only 16, \\"educational measures\\". In November 1968 those sentenced to prison terms were released on probation because, it was reported, they had displayed \\"remorseful insight\\" (\\"reuevolle Einsicht\\"). Erika-Dorothea Berthold was nonetheless prevented from completing her schooling. She was already living with her boy- friend in a commune and was now, despite her stellar academic pedigree, required to train for work as a librarian. Lothar and Erika Berthold (Erika- Dorothea's mother) were appalled. The shock was all the greater because of the prominent part in the protest played by the eldest daughter of a committed academic member of the \\"Ideology Commission\\". By the end of 1968 Lothar Berthold, as the young protester's father, had been obliged to resign not merely from the commission but also from the presidency of the Institute for Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and \\"associated functions\\". Lothar Berthold won the Patriotic Order of Merit in bronzeBerliner Zeitung, 6. October 1963, p 4 in 1963 and then, after just two years, in silver. A normal progression during the next ten or so years would have been to the gold version of the same award. That never happened, but he did win other - possibly less prestigious - awards from the government over the next couple of decades, and it soon became apparent that removal from the Institute for Marxism‚ÄìLeninism would not mark the end of his academic career. Between 1969 and 1972 he was employed as an academic research assistant at the Central Institute for History of the (East) German Academy of Sciences and Humanities in central Berlin. Between 1972 and 1976 he served as the institute's deputy director. In 1976 he took over from Werner Mussler as a director of the Akademie Verlag, which was the publishing house affiliated with the academy. He held core operational responsibilities as the publisher's director for printing and publishing. He also served, between 1979 and 1990, as director of the Weimar based business \\"Hermann B√∂hlaus Nachfolger\\" publishing operation which had, in effect, functioned as a subsidiary of the Akademie Verlag since becoming cut off from its Vienna holding company by the so-called \\"iron curtain\\". In 1990, the year when social and political changes led first to the end of East Germany's forty year Soviet-style dictatorship and then to reunification, Lothar Berthold retired on health grounds, stepping down from all his functions. He does indeed appear to have been in poor and declining health during the years that followed. He nevertheless worked actively with the \\"Marxist working group on the history of the German labour movement\\" (\\"Marxistische Arbeitskreis zur Geschichte der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung\\") which functioned under the auspices of Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which was emerging as a new formulation, for a democratic Germany, of East Germany's old Socialist Unity Party (SED), which itself was by now widely (though by no means universally) discredited and disparaged. In the context of the working group he co-organised various conferences. He also continued to contribute written works to various left- wing ad communist journals.  Works  Between 1963 and 1966 Lothar Berthold served as secretary to the authors' collective, mandated to compile and produce an eight-volume history of the German labour movement. The importance of the project is apparent from the identity of the man leading the project, Walter Ulbricht, better known then as now, for his position as the First Party Secretary - the national leader - than as a scholar of history. It was, therefore, not just as an administrator but also as a compiler-editor and author that Berthold operated at the heart of the party's propaganda structure. Also worth highlighting in Berthold's two-volume biography of Ernst Th√§lmann, the hardline Stalinist leader of the Communist Party between 1925 and 1933 who was later killed by the Nazis after eleven years detained in solitary confinement. Comrades attributed great political value to the biography, seen as a reason why Berthold won the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic not once but twice. He was also active for many years as a \\"Friend of the Ernst Th√§lmann Memorial Centre\\" (im \\"Freundeskreis der Ernst- Th√§lmann-Gedenkst√§tte\\") and a regular speaker at events held in the Sporthaus Ziegenhals (memorial-hostelry) where Th√§lmann held the last meeting of the Communist Party before the Nazis closed down political pluralism back in 1933. = Output (selection) =   Awards and honours  * 1966 and 1979 National Prize of the German Democratic Republic 1st class * 1963 Patriotic Order of Merit in Bronze * 1965 Patriotic Order of Merit in SilverBerliner Zeitung, 7 May 1965, p.4 * 1976 Banner of Labor 2nd classBerliner Zeitung, May 1976, p. 4 * 1986 Star of People's Friendship in SilverNeues Deutschland, 3 October 1983, p.2  References  German Marxist historians German publishers (people) 20th-century German historians Socialist Unity Party of Germany members Recipients of the National Prize of East Germany Recipients of the Patriotic Order of Merit Recipients of the Banner of Labor Recipients of the Star of People's Friendship People from Zabrze 1926 births 2007 deaths ","title":"Lothar Berthold"},{"id":"56405588","text":"Marchioness of Hertford is the title given to the wife of the Marquess of Hertford.

The move was intended to help the health of Catrina's younger sister, Maya, who has cystic fibrosis. Plot The novel opens as the family is ordering at the drive-through of an fictional Double- Back Burger (the colors and logos of which are based on In-N-Out Burger) before leaving southern California for Bah√≠a de la Luna. As the sisters are exploring Bah√≠a de la Luna, they are surprised by a boy named Carlos Calaveras, who turns out to be one of their new neighbors. Catrina and Maya explore their Mexican heritage with the help of Carlos, culminating in a Dia de los Muertos celebration in November. This book could be Raina's best yet Development The magical realism of Ghosts marks a sharp change from Telgemeier's earlier works, which have been autobiographical (Smile [2010]; Sisters [2014]) or realistic fiction (Drama [2012]). Instead, Telgemeier depicts the titular ghosts as real but benevolent presences to help Catrina understand death and deal with Maya's terminal illness. Telgemeier stated she was inspired to write Ghosts in part by the death of her young cousin Sabina, who died from cancer at the age of 13. The scenes from the Day of the Dead celebration were left blank in the initial manuscript submitted to Scholastic. Telgemeier waited until she had attended a Day of the Dead celebration in San Francisco to accurately express her experience in the story, which she later called \\"one of the most moving nights of my life.\\" Aspects of the town of Bah√≠a de la lukr are inspired by Half Moon Bay, Moss Beach, Monterey, Morro Bay, and Santa Cruz.

He was personal surgeon to King Charles II, and author of a medical work called Severall Chirurgical Treatises. Early life Wiseman's parentage is uncertain. In early 1637, at age 16, he was apprenticed at the Barber-Surgeons' Hall to Richard Smith, surgeon, of Little Britain, London. Civil War years Wiseman learned surgery on the battlefield. During the First English Civil War, he joined the royalist army of the west, then under the nominal command of the Prince of Wales. He was present at the first battle of Weymouth on 9 February 1645. He remained in Weymouth during the siege, and subsequently seems to have accompanied the royalist forces into Somerset and Cornwall; he was present at the siege at Taunton, and took part in the fighting of Truro. The royalist army was then under the command of Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton. After the defeat at Truro, on his own account, Wiseman was the only surgeon who continuously attended Charles, the Prince of Wales, from the west of England to France, Holland, and Scotland, in the years 1646‚Äì1650. He was at first attached to the troops in attendance on the prince, but when Surgeon Richard Pile (Pyle) returned to England he became the prince's immediate medical attendant. Wiseman accompanied Prince Charles from Jersey to France, and from France to The Hague, where news arrived in February 1649 of the execution of Charles I. From The Hague Wiseman accompanied Charles II to Breda, Flanders and back to France, arriving at St. Germains in August 1649. He then went to Jersey again, and when Charles left Holland in June 1650 Wiseman accompanied him to Scotland. He was taken prisoner at the battle of Worcester (3 September 1651) and marched to Chester, where he was kept in captivity. Having procured a pass, Wiseman arrived in London about February 1652, and was admitted to the Barber-Surgeons' Company, 23 March 1652. He acted for a time as assistant to Edward Molines of St. Thomas's Hospital. Then he set up in practice for himself, living in the Old Bailey at the sign of the King's Head, where he had royalist patients. Early in 1654 he was rearrested on a charge of assisting Read, a patient, to escape from the Tower of London, and in March 1654 he was sent a prisoner to Lambeth House. It appears that he owed his liberty to friends. Wiseman wrote that he served for three years in the Spanish navy, and from the evidence it has been deduced that this period was from 1654 to 1657. He was in Dunkirk, then a Spanish possession, and the Caribbean. Later life, death and legacy Early in 1660 Wiseman returned to his house in the Old Bailey, where he was living at the time of the English Restoration; but shortly after the Restoration he moved westward to Covent Garden. Ten days after the arrival of Charles II in London, on 8 June 1660, Wiseman was made royal surgeon in ordinary. On 5 August 1661 that Wiseman, already on a pension, was formally appointed and salaried as surgeon by royal warrant. He was promoted to the grade of principal surgeon and serjeant- surgeon to the king in 1672. He was elected a member of the Barber-Surgeons' court of assistants in 1664, and in the following year was appointed Master of the company. Wiseman died suddenly at Bath, Somerset around 20 August 1676. He was buried at the upper end of St Paul's, Covent Garden on 29 August. He believed in the royal touch for the cure of scrofula, and in the miracles wrought by the blood of Charles I. Wiseman was the first of the major British surgeons who elevated the surgical profession. His work was continued by Samuel Sharp, Percivall Pott, and John Hunter. He was essentially a clinical observer; his cases are clearly described, and their treatment is carried out on a plan. His Treatises cover 600 cases, with a broad background (though lithotomy does not appear), and were influential. Works Wiseman's works are written in a plain and simple style; they were used by Samuel Johnson, in the compilation of his dictionary, as a mine of surgical nomenclature. They were: *A Treatise of Wounds, London, 1672, printed by Richard Royston. *Severall Chirurgical Treatises, London, 1676, (Royston and Took); 2nd edit. 1686; 3rd edit. 1696; 4th edit. 1705; 5th edit. 1719; 6th edit. 1734. A pirated edition was published by Samuel Clement at the Swan in St. Paul's Churchyard in 1692. It is called the second edition, but it seems to have been made by printing a new title-page and inserting it into copies of the 1676 and 1686 editions. The work describes over 600 of Wiseman's own cases. In the assessment of biographer G. Hull, \\"It is a more detailed and personal account than any written by his contemporaries, and his sections on the King's Evil and cancer show a remarkable understanding of disease for his time.\\" Family Wiseman's first wife, named Dorothy, died on 23 February 1674, and was buried in the chancel of St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden; his second wife was Mary, daughter of Sir Richard Mauleverer of Allerton Mauleverer in Yorkshire, and granddaughter of Sir Thomas Mauleverer the regicide. His only child was a posthumous son, who was buried near his father in November 1678. His widow married Thomas Harrison of Gray's Inn, the lawyer who settled her husband's affairs, and died in February 1678.

Boppart is a principal investigator at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, where he holds an Abel Bliss Professorship in Engineering. He is a faculty member in the departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Bioengineering, and Internal Medicine. His research focus is biophotonics, where he has pioneered new optical imaging technologies in the fields of optical coherence tomography, multi-photon microscopy, and computational imaging.  Background and education  Stephen A. Boppart was born in the small farming community of Harvard, Illinois. In 1990, he received his B.S. degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in Electrical Engineering, with an option in Bioengineering. In 1991, he received his M.S. degree in electrical engineering from UIUC. His masters research involved the development of multielectrode arrays under Professor Bruce Wheeler. From 1991 to 1993, he developed national laser safety standards at the Air Force Research Laboratory in San Antonio, Texas. He then returned to graduate school to pursue both the Ph.D. and M.D. degrees under a joint program between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard Medical School. He received his Ph.D. in medical and electrical engineering in 1998 under the direction of James Fujimoto, and completed his M.D. in 2000. While at MIT, he was involved in the invention and early development of optical coherence tomography (OCT).  Research  Boppart started the Biophotonics Imaging Laboratory at UIUC in 2000, an interdisciplinary research group working at the intersection of engineering, medicine, and biology. The research focuses on the development of biophotonics for translational medicine in primary care and oncology. Building upon the development of OCT in his graduate studies, Boppart expanded OCT to new application areas. OCT was used to image the tympanic membrane (eardrum) to determine the presence of biofilm, a complicating factor in ear infections. He also developed OCT for intraoperative breast cancer imaging to determine the status of the resection margin. At UIUC, his research interests expanded to include nonlinear optical microscopy. He developed nonlinear interferometric vibrational imaging, a variation of CARS microscopy, for imaging cancer resection margins. He also pioneered multimodal-multiphoton microscopy, the combination of several nonlinear optical imaging modalities into a single imaging system. These nonlinear optical imaging technologies were enabled by the development of an optical fiber-based supercontinuum laser source. In 2017, Boppart demonstrated coherent control of neurons. Boppart applied computational imaging to coherent optical microscopy by solving the inverse problem for OCT. This allows for three-dimensional imaging with extended depth-of-field and digital correction of optical aberrations.  Administration and entrepreneurship  From 2006 to 2008, Boppart was the founding director of the Mills Breast Cancer Institute at Carle Foundation Hospital. In 2011, he headed the Strategic Initiative on Imaging at UIUC. He was also heavily involved in the founding of the engineering-based Carle Illinois College of Medicine in 2015. Multiple startup companies have been formed from Boppart's research. In 2011, Diagnostic Photonics, Inc. was launched which develops a handheld probe for imaging the breast cancer resection margin. In 2013, PhotoniCare was formed to commercialize a handheld probe for imaging biofilms in the middle ear.

It was designed in 1983 by Donald Davies and David Clayden at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) in response to a request of the UK Bankers Automated Clearing Services. The MAA was one of the first Message Authentication Code algorithms to gain widespread acceptance.  Development and standardization  The original specification of the MAA was given in a combination of natural language and tables, complemented by two implementations in C and BASIC programming languages. The MAA was adopted by ISO in 1987 and became part of international standards ISO 8730 and ISO 8731-2 intended to secure the authenticity and integrity of banking transactions.  Attacks  Later, cryptanalysis of MAA revealed various weaknesses, including feasible brute- force attacks, existence of collision clusters, and key-recovery techniques. For this reason, MAA was withdrawn from ISO standards in 2002.  Formal specifications of the MAA  The MAA has been used as a prominent case study for assessing various formal methods. In the early 90s, the NPL developed three formal specifications of the MAA: one in Z, one in LOTOS, and one in VDM. The VDM specification became part of the 1992 revision of the International Standard 8731-2, and three implementations in C, Miranda, and Modula-2 were manually derived from that latter specification. Other formal models of the MAA have been developed. In 2017, a complete formal specification of the MAA as a large term rewriting system was published; From this specification, implementations of the MAA in fifteen different languages have been generated automatically. In 2018, two new formal specifications of the MAA, in LOTOS and LNT, have been published.

In 1975, the company was moved to Kyiv after being stationed in Bila Tserkva for one year. It formed the 427th Regiment of the Civil Defense of the USSR. For 16 years it was the official honor guard of the Ukrainian SSR. On March 10, 1992, an honor guard company was introduced into the brigades of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. A year later in 1993, the Guard of Honor of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine was formed, and 3 years later an additional training company was created. On February 15, 2001, it was integrated into the ranks of the Independent Presidential Regiment and was renamed as the Kyiv Presidential Honor Guard Battalion.http://koda.gov.ua/normdoc/pro-vidznachennya-pochesnoyu- gramotoyu-k-217/ Structure presenting arms upon Vice President Dick Cheney's departure from Kyiv in September 2008. * Battalion HQ * 1st Company * 2nd Company * 3rd Company (subordinated to the Ministry of Defense) * Military Band * Symbols Protection Company * Training Company All eligible candidates to join the battalion have to meet certain requirements such as fluency in the Ukrainian language, having a height of at least 180 cm, full secondary education and no physical and/or mental problems.

One of them, called \\"Concordia\\" was developed in 2007 in honor of the 45th anniversary of the creation of the honor guard in 1962. Another badge features Michael, a figure of the coat of arms of the city of Kyiv, indicates the place of deployment of the battalion into the city, and represents the unit's status as a representative unit. The Latin language inscription on the badge: \\"Ubi concordia ibi victoria\\" (meaning \\"Where there is unity, there is victory\\" when translated) is the heraldic motto of this battalion. Uniform The general uniform of the battalion was unveiled on 24 August 2016 based on British and Polish military styles such as a variant of the Polish Rogatywka (the previous one was a peaked cap). The actual uniform jacket was changed from black to brown. It also incorporates details from the uniforms worn by the Ukrainian People's Army, including a cap which features an insignia of a Ukrainian Cossack grasping a cross.Fashion statement: Ukrainian troops debut post-Soviet uniforms , The Washington Times (25 August 2016) Although mainly designed for the Ukrainian Army, the other services represented in the based their new uniforms off of the army's update.

It was first unveiled at the Kyiv Independence Day Parade celebrating Independence Day and the 100th anniversary of the revival of Ukrainian statehood in August of that year. It combines historically Ukrainian designs from swords of the Cossack times with the modern military elements of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. It is in fact based on 16th century weapons used by the Ukrainian Cossacks of Zaporizhia in Eastern Europe. =Shoulder patches and rank insignia= The battalion uses the following three different patches for the three different platoons in each company who are from all three service branches.

It started from the machinery in textile industry (including the equipment of rope and spinning production). Later the technology of steel making, crystal, glass, porcelain and faience production began to develop, especially in Volyn. In the 19th century the discovery of deposits of iron ore and coal, and the construction of railways started off the period of industrial capitalism. Mechanization and machinery began to play an increasingly important role. The establishment of a large number of machine-building enterprises began. In the Russian Empire, machine building was poorly developed and almost all complex machines were imported from abroad. The same situation was in Ukraine. Foreigners built complex machinery here. Kandyba, Ya. Kozlovsky, I. Vasil'kov belong to pioneers of technology in 19th century. One of the areas of technology that reached a high level of development in Ukraine was the technique of road and bridge building (among others: the chain bridge over the Dnieper, built in 1847-1853 by the project of E. Vignel, the high bow gauge bridge and the tunnel near Yaremcha in the Carpathians, built 1898-1902 by Project Bizantz, Matakiewicz, etc.). Railways, the regulation of rivers flow, the construction of power stations in Kiev 1890 and in Kharkov 1897, urban transport technique (tram), the use of natural gas in municipal household, technology of extraction and refining of oil. Professits and engineers, graduates from Lviv Polytechnics (founded in 1845), later Kharkiv (from 1883) and Kiev Polytechnic Institutes (since 1898)did here the best work.  The main achievements of modern technology in Ukraine  * 1927 ‚Äî construction of Dnipropestan. * 1932 ‚Äî the first atom split in the USSR took place at the Kharkov Physico-Chemical-Mathematical Institute. * 1934 ‚Äî the first heavy water obtained in the USSR. * 1937 ‚Äî commissioning of the first USSR electrostatic generator with 2,5 Megawatt output. * 1950‚Äì1955 ‚Äî the creation of the first USSR linear accelerator of charged parts for 20 MeV and electron accelerator at 30 MeV. * 1962‚Äì1965  production of the first computers in the USSR and their further improvement. Creation of new generations of turbo-propeller aircraft (An-22 Antey, An-36), and development of high-speed jet aircraft production. * 1967  commissioning of 800,000 kW power units in Ukraine's power plants (the first unit at the Slavyanskaya TPP). The second half of the 1960s. ‚Äî 1970s. ‚Äî study of the principles of controlled nuclear fusion as a source of energy in the future. * 1974 ‚Äî research method of prom. production in space. Launch of the first carrier in the USSR (\\"Kyiv\\"). * 1975‚Äì1976  construction of blast furnaces up to 5000 m3 (Kryviy Rih). * A striking example of effective innovations introduced into production are the radiotechnical tools for the strategic intelligence of new generation - Kolchuga, presented by the Donetsk National Technical University (2004). Thanks to its functional capabilities, the Kolchuga complex surpasses other technology of this type existing around the world. It is worth mentioning that the technology of industrial production of power high-voltage cable-conductor products which is developed by the scientists of the Institute of Electrodynamics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and cooperators of the \\"Plant\\" Pivdenkabel \\". This technology allows to increase by 1,5 times the resistance to emergency electrical overloads in compare with its imported analogues. Scientists of the Scientific-technological complex \\"Institute of Single Crystals\\" of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine founded the only one in Ukraine high-tech certified production of semiconductor crystalline metals, functionality of which allow the state to receive over 2 mln annually from the sale of science-intensive products on the world market. Also worth mentioning is the development of the real business card of modern Ukraine, namely: the three-stage launch vehicle Zenit-3SL, operating under following programs: \\"Sea Launch\\", CB \\"Pivdenne\\", and \\"Southern Machine-Building Plant\\" (Dnipropetrovsk). Other innovations are: new generation steam turbines with a capacity of 325 MW and Turboatom (Kharkiv); battle tank \\"Oplot\\" KB im. O. Morozov and VO \\"Plant them.

Biography After the graduation from the Philharmonic Institute, where she studied under Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, Litovtseva joined the Mikhail Borodai Troupe and for several years worked in the Russian province, mostly in Kazan, Saratov and Astrakhan.

Biography at the Moscow Art Theatre site (Russian)Nina Litovtseva at the Russian Theatre Encyclopedia (Russian) The much sought-after breakthrough never came: during her first three years she appeared only in episodes, even though Nemirovich-Danchenko is known to have rated her artistic potential high. It was only in 1905 that Litovtseva received her first two substantial parts, Vera Pavlovna in Ivan Mironych by Evgeny Chirikov and Fima in Maxim Gorky's Children of the Sun. Quite prepared to leave MAT, she took a one year leave, to join the Konstantin Nezlobin troupe in Riga. It was there that she fell seriously ill, and, having underwent seven operations in five months, ended up with a limp. A period of severe depression followed (at one point she became so close to committing suicide as to buy a revolver), but in 1908 she returned to work as a reader in drama and stage director at the MAT Second studio, where she produced The Green Ring by Zinaida Gippius (1916) and Mladost by Leonid Andreyev (1918). In 1922, after the Kachalov Group, which she was part of, returned to Moscow having spent three years in Europe, Litovtseva resumed working for the theatre. She directed Nicolas the First and the Decembrists (1926, by Alexander Kugel based on two Dmitry Merezhkovsky novels) and later Armoured Train 14-69 by Vsevolod Ivanov (1927), Our Youth (1930, S.

The negotiations were highlighted by the final meeting between the leaders of both parties, Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong, which was the first time they had met in 20 years. Most of the negotiations were undertaken by Wang Shijie and Zhou Enlai, representatives of the Nationalist government and CPC, respectively. The negotiations lasted for 43 days, and came to a conclusion after both parties signed the Double Tenth Agreement.  Background  After the end of the First United Front in 1927, the Nationalist government launched several purges of Communists within the Kuomintang. The CPC responded to these purges with several uprisings against the Nationalist government. Chiang then retaliated with the Encirclement Campaigns aimed to search and destroy the Chinese Red Army across China throughout the first half of the 1930s. The two sides came to a ceasefire after the Xi'an Incident in December 1936, where the Nationalists and the Communists agreed to form a united front once again to counter Japanese military aggression.  Negotiations  Before the departure from Yan'an. From left: Zhang Zhizhong, Mao Zedong, Patrick J. Hurley, Zhou Enlai, Wang Ruofei In August 1945, Mao and Zhou flew from Yan'an to the Chinese wartime capital of Chongqing to discuss the relationship between the CPC and the KMT in the aftermath of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Soviet Union were receptive to the idea of another united front between the Nationalists and the Communists, as Stalin told the Chinese Communists that it was their \\"best hope for the future\\". Accompanied by American ambassador Patrick J. Hurley, Mao joined Chiang for dinner on 27 August, which was the first time these two leaders had met in 20 years. It would also be their last meeting. After seven weeks of negotiations, the two sides agreed on the common goal to eventually establish a political democracy in China, and to place all Chinese armed forces under the command of Chiang.  Result  Throughout the negotiations, armed struggles between the two parties continued to escalate as the CPC were under attack both north and south of the Yangtze. Mao returned to Yan'an on 11 October, and a joint statement was issued by the CPC and the KMT to outline the result of the negotiations, which is now known as the Double Tenth Agreement. In this agreement, the CPC and the KMT mutually recognized each other, as the two parties planned to form a coalition government. The aim of the agreement was to avoid another civil war. The Nationalist government was unwilling to recognize the areas under control by the CPC. Chiang was unconvinced by the joint statement, and came to realize that a military solution was necessary. Mao described the statement as \\"a mere scrap of paper\\", and expressed to the Soviet Union that the civil war was \\"virtually inevitable\\". By November 1945, it was clear that the agreement was going to be short-lived, and the full- scale civil war soon resumed in 1946.

It thus stands in the geographical centre of Merovingian Francia.  History  The castle was built on the remains of a Roman castrum, which probably guarded the Roman road from Trier to Cologne. In the castle, according to local tradition, Bertrada, the mother of Charlemagne is said to have lived which implies that his birth was around 747 AD. The existence of the castle is first recorded in the 13th century when it is mentioned as a state fortress of the princely imperial abbey of Pr√ºm (c.f. the Middle Rhine Register or Mittelrheinisches Urkundenbuch), archaeological finds have indicated that there were earlier fortifications on the site. After Pr√ºm Abbey was occupied and damaged by French Revolutionary troops from 1794 to 1802, M√ºrlenbach's castle was seized as part of the forced secularisation of the abbey estate and auctioned by France to a private owner. In the late 20th century, the surviving castle walls and buildings were restored by the Tiepelmann family and the state-owned, 30-metre-high, ruined double tower gate was rebuilt with state finance. In 2009, the nine owners were given a grant from the federal and state budgets to secure and maintain the 16th-century, five-metre-thick, southwest roundel. The 13th-century shield wall was also renovated with funding from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  Description and present use  The 30-metre-high tower house, the double tower gateway of the Betradaburg, is visible from a long way off. It has good views of the surrounding countryside and may be visited as part of a guided tour. Every year the M√ºrlenbach Castle Festival (M√ºrlenbacher Burgfest) takes place.

Granny dresses were loose-fitting and often printed with light or pastel colors. They had a vaguely Victorian-era feel to them.  History  Granny dresses had a high neckline and the hems were ankle length. They could also be decorated with buttons, lace, or ruffles, and may display leg-of- mutton sleeves. As the trend continued, the hemline of the dress could also end just above the knees. The dress became more sophisticated by the late 1960s. It was typically seen as a modest dress that covered a larger portion of the body as oppose to more exposing attire seen at the time. The dresses were also considered inexpensive. The look was part of a greater neo-Victorian trend. A Life magazine spread featured Ringo Starr with a model wearing a crocheted granny dress and also featured women in Victorian-like settings. The style reminded people of a simpler, less complicated time, therefore making the dress more popular. The trend was also firmly situated in the youth movement as oppose to an older generation like the name of the dress implies. It tended to be associated with both mod and hippie groups. The granny dress offered an alternative to mini dresses and was a symbol of rebellion. Girls talked about it taking \\"nerve\\" to wear such an old-fashioned style. Granny dresses are most often associated with the designer Laura Ashley, who started selling these dresses to women in the Welsh countryside in the late 1950s. The trend made it to the United States where it was embraced in California and then moved eastward. Granny dress parties and dances were held. One account credits the creation of the dress to designer George Wilner, who worked at Mr. Aref of California. Wilner based his design on a calico dress that a retailer from Glendale showed him. Wilner adapted the calico dress design to be more of an empire-style, similar to dresses worn by Empress Josephine. An article describing the \\"new craze\\" credited the origin to Los Angeles. An apocryphal story about the origin of the dress was that it came into fashion after a dancer was told by a television disc jockey that her dress was too short. In response, the dancer found a floor-length dress to wear and started a fashion craze. Another apocryphal origin story had an old woman wearing such a dress on a tour of \\"night spots\\" in Los Angeles. The woman's youthful vigor \\"attracted attention\\" and a designer, believing her style of dress helped her stay active, copied her dress design. Granny dresses have also been popular in various regions in Egypt in the 1980s. In the 1990s, there was a brief resurgence of the dress at the same time grunge was popular. This time, granny dresses were considered any kind of loose-fitting frock and could be paired with nearly any accessory.  Controversy  In several instances, some students wearing granny dresses to school were suspended or sent home. For example, in Oakland in 1965, girls were sent home for wearing granny dresses due to the length and in Kansas City, Missouri, a mother wore her own granny dress to school in an attempt to convince the principal to allow her daughter to wear one after the dress was banned. In Trumansburg, New York, in 1966, three sisters were suspended from school for wearing the dress. In response to this suspension, the school's attorney claimed that both safety and possible class disruption were the reasons the dress was banned. The school attorney felt that granny dresses were \\"extreme\\" and may encourage students to adopt other extreme forms of dressing.The principal of the school also felt that there was a danger of tripping on stairs because the length of the dresses was too long. Laura M. Lorraine, dean of the Analy Union High School also thought the length of the dresses made them difficult for walking up stairs. In some cases, school authorities just stated that it wasn't \\"suitable school attire.\\" In 1966, a Dear Abby column featured a letter from a girl who was sent to the principal's office for wearing a granny dress.

He was a religious radical, who developed neognostic views based on deism. He spent time in prison, convicted of blasphemy. Life He was the son of Thomas Ilive (died 1724), a London printer of Aldersgate Street, and his wife Jane James (1669‚Äìdaughter of Thomas James, another printer. Two brothers, Abraham and Isaac, were also printers. He was apprenticed to his father, and freed from the bond in 1726, by his mother. Around 1730, Ilive carried on both a type foundry and a printing business. In 1734 he lived by Aldersgate coffee house. From January 1736 to 1738 he published a rival to Edward Cave's Gentleman's Magazine. He sold the foundry in 1740, but kept the printing side going for the rest of his life. He went to live in \\"London House\\", the former residence of Christopher Rawlinson. Ilive died in 1763, aged 58. The printer John Nichols considered him \\"somewhat disordered in his mind\\". Views and gaol sentence Ilive delivered at Brewers' Hall on 10 September 1733, and at Joiners' Hall two weeks later, an Oration on the plurality of worlds and against the doctrine of eternal punishment. He hired Carpenters' Hall, London Wall, and lectured there on the natural religion. In 1738 he brought out another Oration, for which the venue was Trinity Hall, in Aldersgate Street, on 9 January 1738; it was directed against Henry Felton's True Discourses, on personal identity in the resurrection of the dead. In 1751 Ilive printed anonymously the Book of Jasher, a purported translation. It was reissued with additions by Rev. Charles Rogers Bond, Bristol, 1829. Behind unconvincing stories of its origin, the book contained naturalistic explanations of Old Testament miracles. On 20 June 1756 Ilive was sentenced to three years' imprisonment with hard labour in the House of Correction at Clerkenwell, for writing, printing, and publishing an anonymous pamphlet in 1754. Aimed at Thomas Sherlock, it was entitled Some Remarks on the excellent Discourses lately published by a very worthy Prelate by a Searcher after Religious Truth. It was rewritten and enlarged as Remarks on the two Volumes of excellent Discourses lately published by the Bishop of London, 1755. It was declared to be \\"a most blasphemous book\\" denying the divinity of Jesus Christ as well as revealed religion. He remained in gaol until 10 June 1758, spending time writing. The sceptical line Ilive took towards the Genesis creation myth had something in common with ideas found earlier in Charles Blount and Charles Gildon. A strong influence came from the writings of William Derham, in particular Astro-Theology (1715). In what was a tolerant epoch of the Church of England, Ilive was in a select group, with Peter Annet and Thomas Woolston, of those against whom blasphemy charges were successfully brought. Sherlock, by legal action, sought to discourage Ilive from publishing other deist writers. Works In 1730 Ilive printed his major book, The Layman's Vindication of the Christian Religion, in 2 pts. The parts were # The Layman's general Vindication of Christianity # The Layman's Plain Answer to a late Book, a reply to the Grounds and Reasons of Anthony Collins. His Oration was written in 1729, and published in 1733 (2nd edit. 1736), at the wish of his mother Jane. A Dialogue between a Doctor of the Church of England and Mr. Jacob Ilive upon the subject of the Oration spoke at Joyners' Hall, wherein is proved that the Miracles said to be wrought by Moses were artificial acts only, followed in the same year, in support of the Oration. In relation to his profession, Ilive wrote: *Speech to his Brethren the Master Printers on the great Utility of the Art of Printing at a General Meeting 18th July 1750, London, no date. *The Charter and Grants of the Company of Stationers, with Observations and Remarks thereon, 1762, a pamphlet. It dealt with Ilive's grievances against the management of the Stationers' Company, and he called a meeting on 3 July. A committee was appointed to inquire into the state of the company, and a new master and wardens elected. Two further pamphlets were: * Reasons offered for the Reformation of the House of Correction ‚Ä¶ with a Plan of the Prison (1757) * A Scheme (1759) for the employment of persons sent to prison as disorderly.

A display supporting a variable refresh rate usually supports a specific range of refresh rates (e.g. 30 Hertz through 144 Hertz). This is called the variable refresh rate range (VRR range). The refresh rate can continuously vary seamlessly anywhere within this range.  Purpose  On displays with a fixed refresh rate, a frame can only be shown on the screen at specific intervals, evenly spaced apart. If a new frame is not ready when that interval arrives, then the old frame is held on screen until the next interval (stutter) or a mixture of the old frame and the completed part of the new frame is shown (tearing). Conversely, if the frame is ready before the interval arrives, then it won't be shown until that interval arrives. A major purpose of variable refresh rates is the elimination of stutters and tearing by keeping refresh rates in sync with a varying frame rate from a video game. This makes display motion more smooth despite a varying frame rate. Another purpose is power management, by temporarily lowering the refresh rate of a display to save battery power on a laptop or mobile device. Also, a variable refresh rate allows a display to correctly display any arbitrary film or video frame rate within the refresh rate range supported by a display.https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-supersizes- pc-gaming-with-new-breed-of-big-format-gaming-displays  History  Vector displays had a variable refresh rate on their cathode ray tube (CRT), depending on the number of vectors on the screen, since more vectors took more time to draw on their screen. More recently, since the 2010s decade, raster displays gained several industry standards for variable refresh rates. Historically, there was only a limited selection of fixed refresh rates for common display modes.  Implementations  Variable refresh rate display technologies include several industry standards and proprietary standards: * AMD FreeSync * Nvidia G-Sync * VESA Adaptive-Sync press release * HDMI 2.1 Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) * Apple ProMotion *Qualcomm Q-Sync The first phone with VRR was the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.

He earned his undergraduate degree in religion and political science at Phillips University in Enid, Oklahoma. He received his PhD in Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a certificate in African studies. At UW, Longman studied with M. Crawford Young, Aili M. Tripp, Murray Edelman, and Jan Vansina, among others. His dissertation focused on the involvement of Christian churches in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. After completing his PhD, he served as the head of the field office of Human Rights Watch and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) in Rwanda, conducting research for and helping to write the report, Leave None to Tell the Story.Alison Des Forges, Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda, New York: Human Rights Watch, 1999. From 1996 to 2009, he taught at Vassar College, before moving to Boston University. Longman served as director of the African Studies Center, Boston University from 2009 to 2017. In 2017, he became the director of BU's Institute on Culture, Religion, and World Affairs (CURA). He has previously held research and teaching appointments at the Human Rights Center at University of California, Berkeley; the International Human Rights Exchange at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa; the National University of Rwanda; Drake University; and Columbia University. In addition to his teaching positions, Longman has served as an expert witness in a dozen trials related to the Rwandan genocide held in the United States, Canada, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, as well as testifying in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania. He has also served as a consultant for Human Rights Watch, the International Center for Transitional Justice, and USAID in Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda. Longman has served on the Executive Committee of the African Studies Association.  Publications = Human Rights Watch Reports = Longman is listed as a researcher and contributing author to Leave None to Tell the Story, the report on the 1994 Rwandan genocide of the Tutsi written primarily by Alison Des Forges. He wrote the chapters on the genocide in the commune of Nyakizu, one of the three local-case studies in the book. Leave None to Tell the Story is widely recognized as the definitive account of the Rwandan genocide and was awarded the 2000 Raphael Lemkin Book Award from the Institute for the Study of Genocide for the best book \\"that focuses on explanations of genocide, crimes against humanity, state mass killings and gross violations of human rights, and strategies to prevent such crimes and violations.\\" While he was directing the HRW/FIDH field office in 1995‚Äì96, he researched and wrote a report on attacks against ethnic Tutsi in the Democratic Republic of Congo (then called Zaire).Timothy Longman, \\"Zaire: Forced to Flee: Violences against the Tutsis in Zaire,\\" Vol. 8, no. 2 (A), New York: Human Rights Watch, July 1996 He also participated in the research and publication of \\"Shattered Lives,\\" a report that focused on sexual violence during the 1994 genocide. This report was instrumental in pushing the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to bring charges of sexual assault against genocide perpetrators, with the case against Jean-Paul Akayesu setting the precedent that sexual violence could be considered a genocide crime.Shayna Rogers, \\"Sexual Violence or Rape as a Constituent Act of Genocide: Lessons from the Ad Hoc Tribunals and a Prescription for the International Criminal Court,\\" George Washington International Law Review, 2016. Longman also wrote reports for Human Rights Watch on attacks on civilians in the two Congolese wars. In 1997, Longman conducted research in Burundi with journalist Molly Bingham on attacks against civilians in the civil war there. = Publications on Religion in the 1994 Rwanda Genocide = Much of Longman's published work focuses on religion in Rwanda, which is an overwhelmingly Christian country. Longman's first book, Christianity and Genocide in Rwanda, analyzes the involvement of Rwanda's Christian churches in the 1994 genocide.Timothy Longman, Christianity and Genocide in Rwanda, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010. In the book, Longman explores the history of Christianity in Rwanda and argues that churches in the country maintained a close relationship with political power and practiced ethnic discrimination from their foundation. He notes that in the early 1990s some voices in the Christian churches were promoting democracy, fighting for human rights, and opposing ethnic violence, but that the most church leaders strongly supported the regime that ultimately carried out genocide. Longman writes that church support helped make the genocide possible by giving it moral support. ‚ÄúChristians could kill without obvious qualms of conscience, even in the church, because Christianity as they had always known it had been a religion defined by struggles for power, and ethnicity had always been at the base of those struggles‚ÄùLongman, Christianity and Genocide in Rwanda, p. 164. = Publications on Post-Genocide Rwanda = Longman has also published extensively on efforts to rebuild post-genocide Rwanda, most notably in his 2017 book, Memory and Justice in Post-Genocide Rwanda.Timothy Longman, Memory and Justice in Post-Genocide Rwanda, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2017. In this book, Longman looks at the many transitional justice programs that the post-genocide government has implemented, including the grassroots gacaca courts, and how the Rwandan population has responded. He concludes that transitional justice programs in Rwanda have done more to help the Rwandan Patriotic Front government to consolidate its power than to promote justice and reconciliation. The book is based on research conducted when Longman was affiliated with the Human Rights Center at the University of California, Berkeley, that was funded by the MacArthur Foundation, the United States Institute for Peace, the Sandler Foundation, and the Hewlett Foundation. The book received honorable mention for the Melville J. Herskovits Prize and the Bethwell Ogot Book Prize from the African Studies Association and was named the 2017 best book in African politics by the African Politics Conference Group.https://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/2018/12/05/longman-wins-best-book-in- african-politics-at-asa-meeting/  References  1964 births Living people ","title":"Timothy Longman"},{"id":"56407251","text":"Plagiognathus is a genus of plant bugs in the family Miridae.

Development started in 1949 at the British Army's Radar Research and Development Establishment as the AA No. 4 Mark 7 to provide medium-range early warning for up to sixteen anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) batteries. Early in the program, the team saw the Royal Navy's Comprehensive Display System, and adapted it as the Data Handling System. This provided a semi-automated track while scan function that allowed operators to handle larger numbers of aircraft. The system was originally designed to support AAA guns by passing data on a selected target to point (or \\"put on\\") the AAA's local gun laying radar. The defensive role began to move from guns to the new Bloodhound missile, and the Mark 7 was adapted to work with that missile's Yellow River radars. In 1953, the RAF took over the air defense role and gave the system the Type 82 name. The first prototype began operation that year and a second was briefly used in 1955 before being moved to the UK east coast as an operational unit in 1957. Three production units were added in 1960. The Type 82 was withdrawn from the tactical control role in January 1963, as the data it provided for Bloodhound was now available from other radars like the AMES Type 80s. They were then repurposed as air traffic control systems, where its ability to measure range, bearing, elevation and secondary radar information in a single unit was a major advantage over previous systems. During this period they were manned by military and civilian operators. In spite of their increasing age, three of the systems lasted into the 1980s and '90s in this role. History=Earlier systems= During World War II, the British Army had a number of radar systems used in the anti-aircraft warfare role. These included the \\"Gun Laying\\" (GL) radars that provided short-range highly- accurate aiming information, and the \\"Tactical Control\\" (TC) radars that fed less accurate but longer-range information to the GL units. It was difficult to combine these two roles into a single radar; the accuracy of the GL role required a very thin pencil beam, which was not useful for scanning large volumes of the sky in the search role. One of the most successful of the TC radars was a Canadian design known as the Zone Position Indicator (ZPI) that was taken into operational use as the AA No. 4 Mark IV. This was developed using the electronics of the ASV Mk. II radar combined with a rotating radar antenna and custom display system. By the late-war period, the same developers had produced a model using a cavity magnetron known as the Microwave Zone Position Indicator (MZPI). The British Army purchased 150 of these sets as the AA No. 4 Mark VI, and they were delivered shortly after the war ended. These units, and similar designs from the UK, had the problem that they did not indicate altitude. This was not a concern during the war because the information would be handed off to nearby gun-laying radars, which could determine the altitude. However, these new designs intended to cover large areas and handoff to dispersed gun-laying radars, so some indication of altitude would be needed to help the GLs in their initial pointing. This could be accomplished by a separate height finding radar, but a single radar that could provide reasonably accurate direction and altitude would make this process easier. =3D development= The Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE), who handled development of radars for the Army, began exploring the idea of a 3D radar that could measure the vertical angle of the target at the same time as its bearing and range. Their solution was to split the signal into several waveguides and feed horns that were positioned in a vertical stack. Each one had a reception pattern a few degrees wide vertically, and by careful arrangement, they could be overlapped so their half-power points were lined up. The echo of a target would be received by two of these feeds at any given time, and by comparing the relative signal strengths, the elevation angle could be determined to well under a degree. Serious work on the concept began in 1947, first with a mechanically spiral- scanned X-band system, and later, various experiments with stacked feeds. At the same time, research began on the design of a new high-power 25 cm wavelength (L-band) cavity magnetron, a new large-format long-persistence plan-position indicator display tube, and a data link system to send the information to as many as sixteen remote sites. By mid-1948 the basic design was complete; it would operate in the X-band at 10 cm wavelength and use ten feedhorns, each one with a 3 degree vertical beam. To test the concept, an experimental five-beam system was operational in 1949. This used the MZPI as the transmitter and a separate lens-type receiver array. The lens consisted of short metal cylinders open on both ends and aligned with the target, or boresight. Many such cylinders were arranged to make a large grid. Radio signals travelling through the open centres of the tubes slow down, and by cutting the tubes to different lengths, the wavefront of the signal can be focused down like a traditional optical lens. At the focal point were the five receiver feed horns. The lens was synchronized to turn at the same speed as the MZPI. =Orange Yeoman= In 1949 the Ministry of Supply took over direct control of the TRE and RRDE, and assigned the 3D work the Rainbow Code \\"Orange Yeoman\\". By the end of the year the system appeared to be progressing well, with the antenna design completed and a system to feed the ten signals through a series of slip-rings successfully tested. To produce more power in total, a system was developed to feed three magnetrons in parallel. A new foldable antenna was also being tested. Meanwhile, the RAF was beginning to consider the problem of long-range fighter direction and developed a requirement for a new system to be operational by 1957. The Royal Navy had been developing its own 3D radar in this period, the Type 984 radar, and in May 1950 there was some consideration of whether or not it should be used in the RAF as well. In June 1950, the Defence Research Policy Committee studied whether the 984 or Orange Yeoman might better fill the requirement. They asked the War Office and Admiralty to consider whether a single radar would be useful for both fighter control and gun direction; fighter control demanded long range which suggested a slower scanning rate than what would be ideal for a GL radar whose primary concern is rapid notifications in changes of location. Through this period there was a growing interest in moving from anti-aircraft guns to surface-to- air missiles, or as they are known in the UK, surface-to-air guided weapons, or SAGW. There was increasing interest in Orange Yeoman as a system to help direct these weapons, which were expected to be available in the mid-to-late 1950s. Likewise, a new GL radar under development as Yellow River was ultimately redirected to be the radar illuminator for these missiles rather than as a replacement for the AA No. 3 Mark VII used with AAA. AAA would remain in use through a transition period, and there was a desire to accurately feed the information from Orange Yeoman to their existing Mark VII radars. This led to a requirement for Orange Yeoman to have an 80% probability of producing a track that was accurate to within in position and altitude. As the development of the antenna system appeared to be progressing well, in 1950 it was decided to add another feed horn while decreasing the beam width to 2.5 degrees. This gave a total vertical coverage of 27.5 degrees in eleven beams. However, by this time other problems appeared. A major one was that the planned S-band magnetron, the BM 735, was only available in small numbers and would rarely work when pushed beyond 1 MW of its 2 MW rated power. Additionally, the slip-ring system for feeding radio frequency power to the antenna also continued to be a problem. This led to experiments with slip- rings that fed the intermediate frequency (IF) instead, with the magnetron transmitters and first stages of the superheterodyne receivers on the rotating platform. In June 1951, with these problems ongoing, it was decided to move ahead with all the parts that did work in order to get a production system as soon as possible. This led to a system using a single 2 MW magnetron instead of three ganged ones, feeding them via IF slip-rings, and using separate transmit and receive antennas. Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) was contracted to build a test system, which consisted of a gantry framework with two turntables at different altitudes, the lower one with the transmitter antenna and the receiver above it. The complete system was working for the first time in 1953. =Data Handling System= From 1948, there had been ongoing experimentation with a new display system that stored radar data over subsequent \\"sweeps\\" and then extracted tracking information from that data. This would provide track while scan capability that would greatly ease the task of deciding which AA guns should be trained on which targets. There was also some experimentation with sending this data to control centers using voice quality telephone lines. Near the end of 1949, the RRDE staff were shown the ongoing work on the Comprehensive Display System being developed for the Navy by Elliott Brothers. This quickly led to a project to modify the same basic system to the needs of the AA Command, which required the ability to modify the angle data to account for differences in location and then send the resulting corrected data to the dispersed guns. This led to the Data Handing System project, which had delivered the individual components by the end of 1950. A complete system was built at the RRDE with help from Metrovick and British Thomson-Houston during 1951, which was able to track up to 12 targets and had two large-format displays for the direction officers. A larger system with 36 tracks was built and connected to the prototype Orange Yeoman during 1952. At first, the system required the operators to update the information for a given track by watching the radar display and moving a cursor dot with a joystick. Due to the desired rate of updates, this required a dedicated operator for every six tracks. This was later improved by the addition of a double-integrator which could automatically update the tracks as long as the aircraft did not change its course. This greatly reduced the number of manual updates required and allowed the same number of operators to track a much larger number of aircraft. A second group injected height measurements into the storage system at a slower pace, as changes in altitude were much less frequent, so only two or three operators were required for this task. This \\"Analysis Group\\" also handled the identification friend or foe (IFF) system. Finally, an \\"Accurate Tracking Group\\" would pick targets from the store for longer-term, more accurate measurements, using that data to feed off to the GL radars at the gun sites. =Type 82= By early 1953, development was largely complete and the system was given the official name Radar, Anti-Aircraft, Number 4, Mark VIII, or AA No. 4 Mk. VIII for short. Three locations, London, Liverpool and Southampton, were selected for operational units, with their primary role being to hand off data to the Yellow River radars, now known as Radar, Anti-Aircraft, Number 3, Mark V or AA No.3 Mk.V. In June 1953, the first of these sites was selected, on the hills near Newton overlooking the Frodsham Anti-Aircraft Operations Room covering the Liverpool area and relatively close to the Metrovick works. It was paired with six gun sites, Crank (MY10), Thurstaston (MY24), Norley (MY39), Flint (MY45), Altcar (MY66) and Penketh (MY76). In 1953, the RAF took over responsibility for anti- aircraft missiles, with the ultimate goal of removing large-calibre AAA from UK service at some time in the future. The Army would retain their smaller- calibre AAA and missiles for defense in the field, but would no longer be tasked with the defense of the UK. As part of this handover, Orange Yeoman became a TRE project and was assigned the name AMES Type 82, although the actual development remained at the normally Army-related RRDE. The RAF initially saw a role for the Orange Yeoman similar to that of the Army, and continued development of two prototypes and three production sites. In 1955, a series of tests using the Orange Yeoman and Data Handling System at Malvern and a Yellow River radar located away to the north succeeded in automatically directing the Yellow River onto a target aircraft with a 100% success rate with no intervention by the operators of the Yellow River. The Frodsham site was operational by September and took part in that year's BEWARE military exercises, where it proved very successful. =Carcinotron= In 1950 a new type of microwave-frequency vacuum tube known as the carcinotron was introduced by the French company CSF. It was revealed publicly in the IEEE in 1953. The carcinotron was unique in that its output frequency could be changed across a wide band by changing the input voltage. This allowed it to sweep through an entire selected band so rapidly that it appeared to be a constant radiator at all frequencies. Although it output only a few watts, compared to a million times that from the radar's transmitter, the radar equation meant that was larger than the return from the radar signal being reflected off the aircraft. A sample was purchased from CSF and fit to a Handley Page Hastings known as \\"Catherine\\" in 1954. In tests it was found to produce a solid signal on the Type 80 display even when it was under the radar horizon. At long range, an Avro Lincoln had to be away from the jammer before it cleared the effect and became visible, meaning a single jammer could easily hide an entire formation of aircraft. At closer ranges, the signal began to be picked up in the antenna's side lobes, eventually causing the entire screen to be filled with noise. These tests appeared to suggest that the carcinotron would make long-distance radars useless, and interest in using Orange Yeoman as a tactical radar during wartime disappeared. The Central Flying School expressed their interest in the Data Handling System as a way to simplify their fighter interception duties. This led to further development of the prototype system at RRDE through 1954 and 1955, adding displays to plan interceptions directly on the screens. However, by this time the AMES Type 80 had undergone a number of improvements that gave it the capability to guide fighters, and the need for a separate system to provide this capability disappeared. There was also an effort to interest the civilian air traffic control authorities in the system, especially for the experimental Northern Air Traffic Control Center being set up in Preston, Lancashire outside Liverpool. However, the cost of maintaining the complex system was well beyond their budget, even if the radar was given to them for free. The idea went no further at the time. =Deployment= As the RAF began to study various air war scenarios, it became clear any sort of comprehensive air defense was hopeless in an era where a single bomber could destroy an entire city. They abandoned the idea of general anti-aircraft operations and began to focus entirely on the defense of the deterrent force in the form of the V bomber fleet. For this role the inland site at Frodsham was not needed as no missiles would be based in the area. It remained operation for a few years for training. RAF North Coates was eventually selected as the second site in 1955, where it could provide coverage over the airfields in the Midlands area. This was a prototype station, so the radar from Frodsham was dismantled and sent there, long before the buildings were complete. In the summer of 1957 the system was given the Type 82 name, and Yellow River became Type 83 a few months later. The system was completed in early 1957, and acceptance trials were completed in the summer as OR.2094. The need to tie the Type 82 data into the overall ROTOR network was obvious, and work on this concept continued through the next two years. The first production version of the system became operational in the middle of 1960 at RAF Watton, and two additional units at RAF North Luffenham and RAF Lindholme. =Air Traffic Control= In 1963, the Type 82's were withdrawn from the Bloodhound missile mission. By this time the Type 80s were covering the same area, and there was concern that the carcinotron would render the Type 82 useless in a war anyway. The Bloodhound units were then connected to the Master Radar Stations at RAF Patrington and RAF Bawdsey, which were upgraded to provide this information. As the Type 80 was just as susceptible to jamming, this move was a temporary one until the Linesman/Mediator system was operational, at that time expected in 1968. Within a few months of the Type 82's being stood down, the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff completed a study on \\"Conversion of the Tactical Control Centres at Watton, North Luffenham and Lindholme to an ATC role\\". They noted that this area was largely uncovered by ATC radars, contained 38 airfields with 75,000 runway movements a month, and that 90% of all the near-miss incident reports were filed in this area. The suggestion was accepted in June 1963. Little change was required for the switch to the ATC role, but the chance was taken to convert the antennas to circular polarization, which RRE experiments had demonstrated reduced the clutter from rain and hail. Servicing of the systems passed to civilian contractors, and they were manned by both military and civilian air traffic controllers. They remained in service in this role at least into the 1980s and possibly 1990s. Description The Orange Yeoman prototype built at the RRDE in Malvern lacks the IFF antenna on top, but is otherwise typical of the operational systems. On the right is the transmitter, above it the lens, on the left is the reflector, and on the near side of the lens are the eleven receiver feed horns. =Antenna arrangement= The Type 82 had separate antennas for transmitting, receiving and handling reception of IFF signals. The transmitter consisted of a slotted waveguide in front of a cosecant-squared linear reflector wide by high. This produced a fan-shaped beam that was narrow horizontally and covered about 30 degrees vertically. Above and behind the transmitter was the main receiver. This was a hexagonal array of metal tubes acting as a lens that separated the reflected signal into a series of vertically stacked stripes, 2.5 degrees wide. The signal was focussed on a rodded reflector behind the lens that provided the horizontal focusing, narrowing it to 1.5 degrees. The signal reflected to the back of the lens, as seen from above, where a series of eleven vertically stacked feed horns received the now-focused signal. The IFF antenna was also a slotted waveguide, positioned above the receiver array. The system originally used a smaller transmitter with a wider beam, and rotated at 24 RPM. It was later equipped with the larger transmitter antenna, and its rate was reduced to 12 RPM. During the conversion to the ATC role, the rate was reduced again to 8 RPM. =Electronics= The transmitter was a magnetron that produced pulses of 1.5 MW at 3 GHz with a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 750 pulses per second and a pulse length of 2 microseconds. =Performance= The Type 82 was designed to measure bearing, range and elevation with enough accuracy to place a target return within a box. In testing, it demonstrated a 95% chance of placing the target within horizontally, and in altitude. It had a maximum range of about . =Displays and interpretation= The Type 82 was notable for its use of the Data Handling System, one of the earliest examples of computerized radar handling, albeit in a semi-automatic and analog form. Positions were recorded by capacitors with 150 V representing a range of in military use, and for ATC use. Initial data for a track was entered by two dedicated Track Allocators who considered only the outermost regions of the plan-position indicators. Return blips that they found interesting were strobed and sent into one of 18 stores each, for a total of 36 tracks. Each set of 18 tracks for one allocator was split among three Trackers, who would see the selected blip on their display. They would then begin tracking the target by moving the joystick so their on-screen cursor remained on top of the blip as it moved from sweep to sweep. They had their own strobing system that could hand off a target for IFF checks and altitude measurements. Altitude measurement was carried out on a custom display. This displayed the signals from two adjacent beams on a single line on the display, with ten such lines. When the Trackers strobed a target, only those signals would appear on the altitude display, causing two blips to appear on each line. By comparing the relative length of the two blips, the operator could estimate the altitude.

A joint offensive was launched by the Garud detachment and the 13 Rashtriya Rifles in Chanderger village, Bandipora district, Jammu and Kashmir based on technical intelligence. His detachment covertly approached the house that had suspected militants hiding in it and laid a close quarter ambush. Nirala, armed with a light machine gun, positioned himself close to the approach of the hideout, cutting off all escape routes. In a bid to escape, the six militants rushed out, shooting and throwing grenades. He retaliated and shot down two category ‚ÄòA‚Äô militants and injured two others. In the exchange, he was hit by a volley of small arms fire and kept firing despite being critically injured. Nirala subsequently succumbed to the fatal injuries received during the encounter in which all six militants were killed.

Five of the spans are timber stringer approach spans, four east of the main span and one to its west. The main span is a Pratt through truss, in length. Its western abutment is a timber trestle, while the eastern one is of concrete construction with fieldstone wing walls. The truss consists of pin-connected elements, and the floor decking consists of timbers laid over steel I-beams. The bridge was built in 1906 by the Iowa Bridge Company of Des Moines, Iowa. The county had a contract with that company to provide its steel truss bridges between 1905 and 1911, apparently as part of a common but illegal practice of \\"pooling\\", in which companies divided the state into areas where they did not compete against one another.

The technology differs from perimeter-based protections such as firewalls, that can only detect and block attacks by using network information without contextual awareness. RASP technology is said to improve the security of software by monitoring its inputs, and blocking those that could allow attacks, while protecting the runtime environment from unwanted changes and tampering. RASP- protected applications rely less on external devices like firewalls to provide runtime security protection. When a threat is detected RASP can prevent exploitation and possibly take other actions, including terminating a user's session, shutting the application down, alerting security personnel and sending a warning to the user. RASP aims to close the gap left by application security testing and network perimeter controls, neither of which have enough insight into real-time data and event flows to either prevent vulnerabilities slipping through the review process or block new threats that were unforeseen during development. Implementation RASP can be integrated as a framework or module that runs in conjunction with a program's codes, libraries and system calls. The technology can also be implemented as a virtualization. RASP is similar to Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST), the key difference is that IAST is focused on identifying vulnerabilities within the applications and RASPs are focused protecting against cybersecurity attacks that may take advantages of those vulnerabilities or other attack vectors. Deployment options RASP solutions can be deployed in two different ways: monitor or protection mode. In monitor mode, the RASP solution reports on web application attacks but does not block any attack. In protection mode, the RASP solution reports and blocks web application attacks.

Early life He was born into the Polish community in Estonia, the son of a notary, Juliusz Ferdynand Linke and Maria, n√©e Starorypi≈Ñska. In 1919 the family were 'repatriated' to Poland and settled in Kalisz, a town destroyed in 1914. He began his art studies in the Bydgoszcz School of Industrial Art 1922‚Äì1923. He spent the next two years in the Krak√≥w Art School, followed by five years at the Warsaw Academy of Art 'ASP', under the direction of Tadeusz Pruszkowski. He joined the 'Wolnomalarska Lodge' (a painterly pun in Polish on freemasonry) and was a member of the ‚ÄûPowi≈õle‚Äù group before and after the Second world war. Career His d√©but as a graphic artist was in the columns of the satirical review, Szpilki in 1936. He contributed illustrations to such publications as Dziennik Ludowy, Nowe ≈ªycie, Sygna≈Çy, Tygodnik Robotnika, and after the war to Polityka and Trybuna Ludu. As an artist, he worked in thematic periods. His earliest such period of drawings took the title, War (1931‚Äì1932), followed by a series called Miasto, 'the City' (1931‚Äì1935). He was a friend of Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz with whom he made a trip to Silesia. The result was a series of 30 drawings under the heading of ≈ölƒÖsk. In May 1938 an exhibition of these latest works in the Instytut Propagandy Sztuki (Institute for the Propagation of Art) was shut down on account of its potentially 'pernicious social effects'. After the outbreak of World War II, he was forced to flee with his wife and they went to Lw√≥w, for fear of Nazi reprisals for his cartoons of Adolf Hitler that had appeared in the press. In 1942 he was exiled to Orsk in the Ural Federal District. Only in 1946 was he able to return to Poland from there. On his return to Warsaw he painted his most celebrated Screaming Stones series (1946‚Äì56). It was a terrifying vision of the capital in ruins. The work was eponymously published in 1959 with an introduction by Maria DƒÖbrowska. After the war he exhibited rarely as his work did not cohere with the then prevailing political climate. He was widowed and remarried before the war. There were no children. Linke died of cancer and is buried in PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery in Warsaw. His work assessed Linke's creativity is often characterized as metaphorical realism. His art is based on visualisations, as it were depictions of literary metaphor. Both the composition of individual works and the structure of his series rest on an evident narrative approach. Most of his work is on paper with the use of Water colour, Gouache, Crayon, pencil or Indian ink. He often scraped the surface of the paper and applied Collage. One of his most famous and late works is the Bus, a palpable reference to Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski's play, Wesele, The Wedding. As in the drama, so the figures on the Bus can be seen as slaves who stand in the way of their own liberation. A song, Czerwony autobus was inspired by the painting.Jacek Kaczmarski, Czerwony autobus , [in:] Ale ≈∫r√≥d≈Ço wciƒÖ≈º bije, Warszawa 2002, p. 87 (disc recording dyskografia Jacka Kaczmarskiego#Muzeum, 1981Muzeum).

Assembly legislation After Newark Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson and his city council approved a series of salary increases of up to 50% for the city's elected officials in July 1974 and after the Mayor and council refused to rescind the increases, Adubato led a group of fellow Assemblymembers to block a series of measures that had been under consideration for adoption by the Assembly that would have allowed the city of Newark to increase taxes and fees on income and other charges that would have brought the city $18 million in revenue. Adubato said that \\"the recent irresponsibility exhibited by the Newark City Council in raising their salaries substantially\\" had justified the move, while a city spokesperson argued that \\"the legislators are threatening to withhold $18‚Äêmillion in special tax revenue from city residents\\" over raises that totaled $150,000 for elected officials and department heads.Sullivan, Joseph F. \\"Council Decision to Raise Pay May Cost Newark Tax Revenue Granted by State\\", The New York Times, October 27, 1974.

'The legislation may be necessary for Newark, but the recent irresponsibility exhibited by the Newark City Council in raising their salaries substantially since July 1, 1974, has made it necessary to reconsider legislation designed to raise money for Newark,' Mr. Adubato said.\\" The bill was released after several city councilmembers met with the Taxation Committee and argued that the fiscal impact of the loss of revenue would be damaging to the city; several Assemblymembers opposed holding the bill \\"hostage\\" to Adubato's efforts to get the raises rescinded.Sullivan, Joseph F. \\"Legislative Fight Looms Over Raises In Newark\\", The New York Times, November 3, 1974.

'This may be equitable, but it is unfair,' he said.\\" In April 1977, Adubato introduced a bill, co-sponsored by 45 of the 80 Assembly members, that would put a referendum on the ballot asking voters to approve a school voucher plan under which parents would receive a voucher that could be used at any school of their choice, public or private, in an amount equal to the amount the state spends per pupil on education.Waggoner Walter H.

Bope was an American steel hulled propeller driven Great Lakes freighter built in 1907 by the Superior Shipbuilding Company of Superior, Wisconsin for service on the Great Lakes of North America. She was used to transport bulk cargoes such as coal, iron ore and grain. History The Bope was launched on October 19, 1907 as hull #519. She had a length of 560 feet, a beam of 56 feet and a depth of 30 feet. She was powered by a 2,200 horsepower quadruple expansion steam engine and fueled by two coal-fired Scotch marine boilers. In 1913 the Bope was transferred to the Lackawanna Steamship Company of Cleveland, Ohio. Later that year the fleet was renamed Interlake Steamship Company. In 1916 the Bope was renamed E.A.S. Clarke. The Clarke anchored off the Great Lakes Engineering Works in the Detroit River on October 26, 1924 because of heavy fog. As she was swinging at anchor the steamer B.F. Jones struck the Clarke near her aft deckhouse causing her to sink almost immediately. No lives were lost in this accident. In 1952 the Clarke had a new top tank and two new side tanks installed. She also had her cargo hatches rebuilt from 32 cargo hatches on 12-foot centers to 16 hatches on 24-foot centers. In 1953 she had new Foster-Wheeler water tube boilers installed. She went into layup in the winter of 1960. She remained in layup when she was transferred to the Pickands Mather Company. Kinsman Voyager In April 1970 the Clarke was sold to the Kinsman Marine Transit Company of Cleveland, Ohio and renamed Kinsman Voyager. On September 30, 1972 the Voyager was departing the Globe elevator in Superior, Wisconsin when she backed into a mud bank and severely damaged her rudder. She was laid up on May 26, 1973 in Toledo, Ohio. In the Spring of 1974 the Voyager was sold to the Marine Salvage Ltd. of Port Colborne, Ontario.

An example of satirical participatory art, it is a fully functioning toilet made of 18-karat solid gold. It was stolen in 2019 from Blenheim Palace, where it was exhibited on loan from the permanent collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Exhibitions=Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum= Cattelan created the toilet in 2016 for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. It was made in a foundry in Florence, cast in several parts that were welded together. Made to look like the museum's other Kohler toilets, it was installed in one of the museum's bathrooms for visitors to use. A special cleaning routine was put in place. The museum stated that the work was paid for with private funds. According to the museum, over 100,000 people waited in line to use America, which was guarded by a security guard posted outside the bathroom. According to Cattelan, the work was made of of gold, which in September 2019 was valued at more than four million dollars as bullion. As an artwork, it has been estimated as high as six million. In September 2017, when the museum declined a White House request to loan its 1888 Van Gogh painting Landscape with Snow for President Donald Trump's private rooms, curator Nancy Spector offered to loan America instead. Any reply by the White House was not reported. =Blenheim Palace= In September 2019, America was installed at Blenheim Palace in the United Kingdom, where it was available for use as part of an exhibition of Cattelan's works. It was placed in a water closet formerly used by Winston Churchill. On 14 September, the sculpture was stolen. A representative of Blenheim had earlier commented that because America was plumbed in, and potential thieves would be aware of its use, security was not much of an issue. Because it had been connected to the building's water pipes, the theft caused structural damage and flooding to the World Heritage Site. Two men were arrested and released in connection with the incident. Cattelan commented: \\"I always liked heist movies and finally I'm in one of them.\\" Blenheim's insurance company has stated that up to approximately $124,000 can be paid in reward for the return of the toilet. In mid-October, three new arrests were made in connection to the theft. By November, the total number of arrests was six, all of whom have been released without charge. Speculation about the fate of the toilet includes it being melted down, that it has been hidden fairly close to Blenheim and that the theft is a prank by Cattelan. Local imitations of the work have been made, including one that was itself stolen. Interpretation The Guggenheim museum linked the meaning of the sculpture to the career of Donald Trump, writing in September 2016 that \\"the aesthetics of this 'throne' recall nothing so much as the gilded excess of Trump's real-estate ventures and private residences\\". Cattelan himself declined to give an interpretation of his work, which he conceived before Trump's presidential candidacy. He said that the connection to Trump is \\"another layer, but it shouldn‚Äôt be the only one.\\" The work has also been described as an interpretation of Marcel Duchamp's 1917 sculpture Fountain. Art critic Jonathan Jones, using the work at Blenheim Palace, opined that it felt \\"Much like peeing on porcelain. But here, among all the photos of young Winston, it also feels like pissing on British history.\\" He also found the sculpture reminiscent of prime minister Boris Johnson's hair. Other gold toilets In 2002 Winger Lam Sai-wing, a Hong Kong businessman, included two gold toilets in what he called a shrine to Lenin. He referred to a comment by Lenin about the use of gold after the victory of socialism. In 2019 the Hong Kong jewellery firm Coronet displayed a gold toilet in Shanghai. This toilet had a seat made of bulletproof glass containing more than 40,000 small diamonds. Cattelan has stated that he made three gold toilets.

Description Species of Tetraena are shrubby or herbaceous, the tallest being around . The leaves are opposite, or sometimes borne on short shoots and then appearing to be alternate. They may or may not have stalks (petioles). The flower usually has five petals and five sepals, rarely four, and ten stamens. The flower is usually tube-like in appearance with white to pale orange petals. The ovary has three to five chambers (locules). The ripe fruit is variable in shape, splitting into parts before releasing the seeds. Taxonomy The genus Tetraena was erected by Karl Maximovich in 1889 for the species Tetraena mongolica. Until 2003, this was the only species recognized in the genus. Molecular phylogenetic studies suggested that the genus Zygophyllum was not monophyletic, since Tetraena and some other genera were nested within it.

The regiment traces its origins back to the militia cavalry regiments raised in the colony of South Australia, such as the Adelaide Cavalry Squadron, the Adelaide Mounted Rifles and the South Australian Mounted Rifles. This is a different unit to the pre-World War I, 18th Australian Light Horse (Western Australian Mounted Infantry). History The 18th Light Horse Regiment was formed on 31 March 1921, drawing upon elements of the existing Light Horse regiments in South Australia for personnel. It was headquartered at Unley, in Adelaide. The initial role of the 18th was as divisional cavalry for the 2nd Cavalry Division, although it routinely trained with the South Australian-based 6th Cavalry Brigade, which included the 3rd Light Horse, 9th Light Horse, 23rd Light Horse and supporting units. During the 1920s the Australian Light Horse converted from their pre- war mounted rifles role to that of cavalry modelled along British Army lines. However, by the end of the 1920s the stringent financial situation across the Army, and the suspension of the compulsory training scheme, led to the amalgamation of a number of light horse units. This led to the linking of the 18th with the 23rd Light Horse Regiment to form the 18th/23rd Light Horse Regiment in 1929. The 23rd Light Horse was not maintained during the period in which they were linked with the new unit remaining in the former 18th Light Horse locations. In October 1936, the units were unlinked and the 18th was raised as the 18th Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment (Adelaide Lancers). Around this time, the regiment was awarded four battle honours for the service of predecessor units that had fought during World War I. As a machine gun regiment they provided fire support to the 2nd Cavalry Division, based in Victoria and South Australia. They were equipped with Vickers Medium Machine Guns which were transported via civilian trucks which were hired from members of the unit given the very limited motorisation which the Army had undergone by this time. By 1938, the 18th Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment was part of the 6th Cavalry Brigade along with the 3rd and 9th/23rd Light Horse Regiments. In the late 1930s, the regiment came under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Blackburn, VC. As the prospect of war loomed again in 1939, the unit prepared for service overseas. However, when the Second World War broke out and this did not eventuate, Blackburn and many of the officers and men of the unit joined the 2nd Australian Imperial Force's 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion, which fought in Syria and later formed part of the ill-fated Black Force in Java. The unit was converted to the 18th Motor Regiment in March 1942. However, this proved to be a short-lived step as on 8 May 1942 the unit was ordered to convert to an armoured regiment and was renamed the 12th Armoured Regiment. At this time the unit was transferred to the Australian Armoured Corps. Following the Second World War, the South Australian light horse units were perpetuated through the 3rd/9th South Australian Mounted Rifles, which was raised as part of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps.

The primary aim of the foundation is the archival, preservation, and dissemination of historical media related to video games. History In a talk given at the 2016 Game Developers Conference, Frank Cifaldi expressed concern over the state of video game preservation. Noting that a significant amount of feature films produced before 1950 are now irrecoverably lost, Cifaldi found himself wondering if the early history of video games would ultimately suffer the same fate. In highlighting the disparity between modern film preservation and game preservation, Cifaldi lamented that the games industry was doing \\"a pretty terrible job of maintaining [its] legacy\\". Cifaldi would later claim that The Film Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of film, was a major inspiration for the VGHF. Prior to the founding of the VGHF, several members of its founding board had collaborated with and donated to the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Videogame Museum, and the Strong National Museum of Play. The foundation launched in February 2017, an event which was marked by a collaborative livestream between the VGHF and video game news outlet IGN. Activities Per the Video Game History Foundation's mission statement, the foundation's primary goal is to catalog, digitize, and preserve the history of video games. The media preserved by the foundation covers a broad spectrum; in addition to video games, the foundation also archives source code, design documents, press kits, posters, video tapes, newspapers, and photographs. Particular attention is given to preserving the promotional ephemera produced during a game's release window, which may not necessarily be preserved as thoroughly as the games themselves. Cifaldi has characterized this ephemera as being immensely valuable to historians, commenting; \\"I think that the greatest discoveries we're going to find are on materials that people don't know are important.\\" The foundation seeks to aid and facilitate video game museums and archives by donating collected material after its preservation. Artifacts in the foundation's possession are often transitory, and are donated to a permanent home after their digitization and archival. A \\"digital library\\" of the VGHF's collected assets is currently under development, a task which Cifaldi estimated would take several years given the size and scope of the project. As an intermediary solution, the foundation periodically selects assets from their \\"backend library\\" to upload and publish online. The Foundation launched its Video Game Source Project in October 2020, an effort to collect the original source code and other assets for classic video games which it will house in its archives and make available for researchers. The first two games added to this include The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge.

He is considered an emblematic figure of the national theater during the 1980s; his earliest productions are associated with cultural and political resistance to the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Biography The son of industrial engineer Jos√© Griffero Marcel, ex-midshipman of the Lautaro, and of the Antofagastian Gabriela S√°nchez Rojas, Ram√≥n Griffero grew up with his sisters Gabriela Patricia and Mar√≠a Celeste. During his childhood, he traveled extensively with the family, since his mother's second husband was a Colombian diplomat, Nicasio Perdomo Godoy. Hence, he was educated at a dozen schools, among which are Saint Thomas the Apostle, Washington, D.C., the , the Liceo Las Condes, the Salesian School, the Patronage of San Jos√©, and the . He entered the University of Chile in 1971 to study sociology, but two years later, following the coup d'√©tat of General Augusto Pinochet against the socialist government of Salvador Allende, he went into exile in London. There, in Britain, he finished his career with a Bachelor of Arts degree in social sciences from the University of Essex. In 1978 he studied at the National Film Institute of Brussels, where he made the short film L'Escargots, and the following year he entered the Theater Studies Center of the University of Louvain, from which he graduated with a Master's Degree. It was there where he made his debut as a playwright and theater director when, in 1980, he directed his first play Opera por un naugrage, with the University Theater. Ram√≥n Griffero returned to Chile in 1982, after nine years of residence in Europe. Shortly after his arrival, he began to present works in which he revealed his creative vision: a dramaturgy of strong sensations and scenic breaks, in which the traditional narrative structure is broken by the introduction of language based on poetry. From his first works, such as Recuerdos del hombre con su tortuga and, especially with the works mounted together with the company Teatro Fin de Siglo such as Historia de un galp√≥n abandonado and Cinema- Utoppia, Griffero introduced a subversive dramaturgy that marked a new direction towards greater scenic freedom. Throughout his long career, with works written and directed by him such as R√≠o abajo and √âxtasis, Griffero has managed to consolidate his own style, which has been recognized by critics and the public, both in Chile and abroad. His works have as a common denominator an accentuated plastic character and a recurring use of cinematographic devices. These features demonstrate the experimental vocation of his work, whose spirit of transgression has remained intact even after the political uncertainty of the 1980s. Griffero has also ventured into narrative, with the publication of a series of short stories entitled Soy de la Plaza Italia. He has played a sustained role as a mentor of new theatrical generations, teaching at various universities and transmitting a critical attitude towards the Chilean artistic scene in the last decades of the democratic transition. Beginning with his first local premieres, Ram√≥n Griffero developed a dramatic approach that renewed the traditional models of the national theater. His works address the audience through themes and scenic elements that seek to awaken a reflection on the current situation of the country and contemporary society. Issues such as political conflicts and sexuality ‚Äì married, associated with marginality, humiliation, and violence ‚Äì are explored through spatial constructions in which the scenography plays an active role in the plot. These innovations are synthesized in the main contribution of Ram√≥n Griffero to the theatrical language: the dramaturgy of space, a proposal whose development was assisted by the set designer Herbert Jonckers. As a professor, he has taught acting, voice, and direction classes at the School of Theater of the University of Chile, and given workshops. Griffero's works have been performed by various national and foreign theater groups and have participated in international festivals in various countries; they have also been translated and published in a number of languages. In addition, numerous European and Latin American university theses have studied their scenic conceptions. Griffero was director of the Theater School of University ARCIS from 2001 to 2014, and beginning in December of that year he directed the Camilo Henr√≠quez Theater. Since 2017 he has held the position of Director of the , belonging to the University of Chile. Politically, Griffero is on the left, as his work reflects. In his youth he participated in the Revolutionary Students' Front, promoted by the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR), and in Popular Unity. In 2016 he joined the Democratic Revolution, a party that proclaimed him a parliamentary candidate for the V Costa constituency in the November 2017 elections.

Originally established as the Melbourne Metro Rail Authority (MMRA), to deliver the Melbourne Metro Rail Project, the office was later expanded in its responsibilities to include the management and planning of a number of major infrastructure programs on V/Line's regional rail services. It was renamed RPV in 2018 to reflect its expanded scope, and later became one of several project teams comprising the Department of Transport's Major Transport Infrastructure Authority.  Organisational history  For much of the history of the Victorian railway network, construction work was carried out by the Construction Branch of the vertically-integrated Victorian Railways (VR). The first major rail infrastructure project in Melbourne to be delivered by an independent entity was the City Loop railway line, which began construction in 1971. The Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Authority (MURLA), established by the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Act 1970, pioneered a new approach to construction management, where the MURLA employed only a small staff and most work was outsourced to a private consortium by contract. The administrative costs of MURLA were jointly met by the VR, the Melbourne City Council and the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works from their annual budgets, separately to the costs of the project itself. The Metro Tunnel project was first proposed in 2008 by the state government led by John Brumby, following the Eddington Transport Study's recommendation of a new north-south rail connection. It was realigned and rebranded as the Melbourne Rail Link under premier Denis Napthine in 2014, but reverted to closely match its original form when the Liberal government lost the 2014 Victorian election. The establishment of the MMRA was announced in February 2015 with a commitment of $40 million. Premier Daniel Andrews, making the announcement, described the authority's initial task as managing the planning and site investigation works required to formally commence the Metro Tunnel project. The funding was brought forward from a promise made at the 2014 election for $300 million towards the project in the first budget of the new Labor government. From a machinery of government perspective, the creation of the MMRA was part of the reorganisation of the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI) into the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDJTR). Responsibility for the Rail Office of the \\"Moving Victoria\\" program was transferred to DEDJTR from DTPLI and during this process, the Office was renamed and reconstituted as MMRA, reporting to the newly created Coordinator General, Major Transport Infrastructure Program. On 10 March 2015, Evan Tattersall was appointed as the chief executive officer of the MMRA. Previously, Tattersall had been involved in the delivery of the Regional Rail Link and the redevelopment of Melbourne's Southern Cross station. Many of the original staff of the MMRA transferred from other rail infrastructure projects in Melbourne, or from international projects such as London's Crossrail. At the same time as the publication of the Regional Network Development Plan in 2016, a series of major upgrade works for the Ballarat line were announced. In November of that year, Minister for Public Transport Jacinta Allan announced that the Ballarat Line Upgrade would be managed by a dedicated project team established within the MMRA, noting the potential for the projects to together result in electrification of the line to Melton. Planning for the upgrade project was carried out on this basis, with Evan Tattersall describing extension of suburban services as a \\"long-term aspiration\\" that could be completed following the opening of the Metro Tunnel. Prior to the 2017 Victorian Budget, the Andrews government announced that the Ballarat Line Upgrade would be augmented by improvements to each of Victoria's regional passenger rail lines, to be collectively branded as the Regional Rail Revival. Then, in April, the government announced that the MMRA would be renamed Rail Projects Victoria, and begin work on a Melbourne Airport rail link and a high-speed rail line to Geelong. The reorganisation was welcomed by the Public Transport Users Association, who observed that a single rail construction authority would be able to coordinate projects and efficiently manage specialised resources. In mid-2018, it was reported that RPV would take over the Murray Basin Rail Project from V/Line, following problems with the latter's management of the program. On 1 January 2019, with the division of DEDJTR into the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions and the Department of Transport, RPV was abolished as an independent administrative office and incorporated into the new Major Transport Infrastructure Authority as a project team.  Projects = Metro Tunnel = The Metro Tunnel is a pair of rail tunnels between South Kensington in Melbourne's inner north-west and South Yarra in the city's inner south-east. Currently under construction, the tunnels will connect the Sunbury line to the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines through the Melbourne CBD. The project includes five new stations ‚Äì North Melbourne, Parkville, State Library, Town Hall and Anzac ‚Äì and will increase the capacity of the inner Melbourne network by releasing train paths in the existing City Loop underground railway. The tunnel is expected to be structurally complete by 2024 and to open in 2025. RPV is responsible for the delivery of the Metro Tunnel project, including property acquisitions, planning approvals and ensuring positive social outcomes. It appointed a consortium led by Lendlease and John Holland to construct the tunnels in late 2017. = Regional Rail Revival = Regional Rail Revival is the collective branding for a series of major maintenance and development works overseen by RPV on the regional Victorian rail network. The first works to be announced were the Ballarat Line Upgrade, a $518 million package of works including several new crossing loops on the Ballarat corridor, new stabling facilities for trains at Ararat, and several station upgrades along the route. The Bendigo line upgrade works include improved signalling north of Bendigo, and works to increase permissible track speed between Bendigo and Echuca. The Gippsland line includes duplication and stabling facilities, as well as the eventual replacement of the rail bridge over the Avon River. The Geelong and Warrnambool lines will also receive lengths of duplication and signalling improvements. = Melbourne Airport rail link = RPV is responsible for planning, procurement and delivery of a rail line to Melbourne Airport. Construction is expected to begin in 2022 along a preferred route via Sunshine in the city‚Äôs west, with funding from state and federal governments as well as the private sector. An expression of interest process closed in late 2018 and a detailed business case will be completed by RPV in 2019. = Western Rail Plan = From April 2018, RPV became responsible for planning and managing electrification of lines to Melton and Wyndham Vale, at the same time as investigating a dedicated high-speed alignment to Geelong. This work was later announced as part of the state government‚Äôs Western Rail Plan, in additional to the possible high-speed electrification of the Geelong and Ballarat lines.

The most concrete description is that it is the data consists of, for each a scheme S in the base category and \\\\xi in \\\\mathfrak{X}(S), a quasi-coherent sheaf F_{\\\\xi} on S together with maps implementing the compatibility conditions among F_{\\\\xi}'s. For a Deligne‚ÄìMumford stack, there is a simpler description in terms of a presentation U \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{X}: a quasi-coherent sheaf on \\\\mathfrak{X} is one obtained by descending a quasi-coherent sheaf on U. A quasi-coherent sheaf on a Deligne‚ÄìMumford stack generalizes an orbibundle (in a sense).

From August 2002 to April 2010 he was Prelate and from 2006 also Bishop of the Armenian Diocese of Atrpatakan in Tabriz in Iran, which is under the jurisdiction of the Holy See of Cilicia.  Biography  Ara Topouzian was born in the village of Shtora in the Beqaa Valley of Lebanon on 2 April 1966 and baptized on 13 April 1966. Ara went to the Armenian primary school of Zahl√©, and at the age of 12 he entered the Armenian Seminary of the Holy See of Cilicia in Antelias. After completing the 5-year Jarankavorats (high school) program, he became a deacon in 1984. After finishing the Undzayaran (college) program he was ordained a celibate priest and given the name Nshan by Catholicos Karekin I Sarkissian in 1987. In February 1991 he was sent as a visiting priest to the Diocese of Atrpatakan in Tabriz in Iran, and in May 1991 he was appointed Pontifical Legate of Atrpatakan by Karekin I. In August 2002 he was elected Prelate of the Diocese of Aderbadagan.

When he was Prelate, the Ararat Cultural Complex of Tabriz was built at Valman Street (opposite to the Presbyterian Church of Tabriz) close to South Shariati Street and Baron Avak neighborhood with the Armenian Saint Sarkis Church of Tabriz. Due to the efforts of Nshan Topuziaan and other Armenian priests in cooperation with the Iranian government, on 8 July 2008, three ancient church complexes of the Armenian Diocese of Atrpatakan were added to the UNESCO's World Heritage List under the name Armenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran: the Monastery of Saint Thaddeus, the Monastery of Saint Stepanos and the Chapel of Dzordzor. Several times he visited the Arax river near Jolfa, where he observed the destruction of the ancient Armenian cemetery in Julfa in the Republic of Azerbaijan on the opposite bank of the river by Azerbaijani soldiers between 1997 and 2006. Together with other Armenian clergymen and Iranian experts of architecture, he photographed and filmed the soldiers when they were destroying the khachkars and gravestones.

Biography Huscroft was educated at the University of Western Ontario (BA 1980), Queen's University (LL.B. 1984), and the University of Auckland (LL.M. 1987). Huscroft taught at the University of Auckland Law School between 1992 and 2001 and then the University of Western Ontario Faculty of Law from 2002 to 2014, where he was Associate Dean from 2006 to 2008. Huscroft was appointed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario in 2014 on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. During his time on the bench, Huscroft was in the habit of giving lectures to law students at their university. For instance, in a January 2016 appearance at Queen's University, he said that: Huscroft also has participated in Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice seminars, such as when he presented a paper on \\"Sufficiency of tribunal reasons: when do a tribunal‚Äôs reasons engage issues of procedural fairness\\" at their May 2016 Advanced Judicial Seminar on Administrative Law reunion. Notable judgments=In re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act= In June 2019, Huscroft wrote in his dissenting GHGPPA opinion that the decision of the majority could have repercussions to the existing that division of powers between the provinces and the federal government. He noted: \\"federalism is no constitutional nicety; it is a defining feature of the Canadian constitutional order that governs the way in which even the most serious problems must be addressed\\" and \\"in effect, [the federal government] has asked the court to sanction a change to the constitutional order -- to increase Parliament's lawmaking authority while diminishing that of the provincial legislatures, and to do so on a permanent basis.\\" Huscroft's dissent was described as \\"traditionalist\\" in its view of the division of powers and compared to G√©rard La Forest, a former puis-ne on the Supreme Court of Canada, by former Attorney-General Peter MacKay. Published works=In the popular press= Huscroft outlined his criticism of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in a 2012 newspaper article. He argued that the passage of the Charter has provided constitutional status to rights and freedoms while empowering judges to strike down laws passed by democratically elected representatives that are seen to infringe on these rights and freedoms, and that this has resulted in political questions increasingly being brought before the courts and out of the purview of elected representatives. In his view, judges do not have any greater insights into complex social and moral issues than any other person, and therefore the power to find solutions to these issues must be put back in the hands of democratically elected representatives. In support of his position, he pointed out that many judicial decisions interpreting and applying the charter have been controversial, and the opinions of Supreme Court judges have often been divided in these cases. =Articles= * =Learned texts, as editor= * .  . * References University of Western Ontario alumni Queen's University Faculty of Law alumni University of Auckland alumni University of Auckland faculty University of Western Ontario faculty Justices of the Court of Appeal for Ontario Canadian legal scholars Living people Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Grant Huscroft"},{"id":"56408571","text":"Kara Cook is a Labor Party politician.

It is the 21st overall episode of the series and is written by co-executive producer Prentice Penny and directed by Ken Whittingham. It aired on Fox in the United States on March 18, 2014. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Jake and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Jake decides to take an 8-year-old case that is deemed \\"unsolvable\\" and as such, seeks Terry's help in solving it. Meanwhile, Amy continues with her relationship with Teddy. The episode was seen by an estimated 2.50 million household viewers and gained a 1.1/3 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Andy Samberg's performance. Plot When Jake is allowed the weekend off because of a hot streak in solving cases, he decides to take on an 8-year old cold case that everyone believes is unsolvable. With the help of Sgt. Terry (Terry Crews), the two try to crack the case once and for all and, thanks to Jake pulling an all-nighter, he finally solves the case by working out that the supposed murder victim isn't even dead. Meanwhile, Amy plans a romantic trip with new boyfriend Teddy (Kyle Bornheimer), but an unexpected event with Holt, which Amy unwittingly volunteered for beforehand, jeopardizes it. Under Gina's suggestion, she attempts to lie to Holt, claiming she has a dental appointment. However, Holt personally takes Amy to a dentist, causing Amy to reveal that she had plans and lied to Holt, disappointing Holt. The dentist then reveals that Amy's brushing technique has caused seven cavities, to Holt's satisfaction. Gina (Chelsea Peretti) and Rosa (Stephanie Beatriz) let a downtrodden Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) in on one of the best-kept secrets of the precinct, their secret bathroom named Babylon, demanding he be silent about it. But Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller) and Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker) do some of their best detective work ever to figure out what Boyle is hiding. Reception=Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"Unsolvable\\" was seen by an estimated 2.50 million household viewers and gained a 1.1/3 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a slight increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 2.49 million viewers with a 1.2/3 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 1.1 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, behind Glee, fifth on its timeslot and eleventh for the night, behind Glee, Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe, The Goldbergs, Person of Interest, Growing Up Fisher, Chicago Fire, About a Boy, NCIS: Los Angeles, NCIS, and The Voice. =Critical reviews= \\"Unsolvable\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.5 out of 10 and wrote, \\"Another strong showing from the B99 team as we head towards the Season 1 finale. To some degree, the focus has been on Boyle and Peralta's romantic woes over the last couple of weeks, and I assume that will play a big part in the closer.\\" Molly Eichel of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"'Unsolvable' combines those two spheres ‚Äî workplace comedy and the cop show‚Äîexceedingly well. Other episodes have done so, and done it well, but 'Unsolvable' in particular feels like a mature episode structurally. The major plot arcs ‚Äî namely Boyle's possible move to suburban Ottawa with fianc√© Vivian and Peralta's long-simmering crush on Santiago ‚Äî largely stay stagnant. That's totally okay. Both ideas are touched upon in order to create their own self-contained narratives, and there's only so much movement that can happen before their inevitable end, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine needs to save something for the final two episodes. Yet, 'Unsolvable' feels like the work of a show mature enough to move into an even more confident second season than its already thoroughly enjoyable first.\\" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode an 8.8 and wrote, \\"After the gang took a break from busting crooks, following up on leads, or doing anything remotely resembling police work last week in 'Fancy Brudgom,' they‚Äôre back‚Äîwell, most of them, at least ‚Äî to acting like they're cops with 'Unsolvable,' which means that all of the heartfelt, character-oriented goodness that's come to define the series' overarching quality gets pushed aside in favor of hilarity in law enforcement for most of the episode.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2014 American television episodes Brooklyn Nine-Nine (season 1) episodes ","title":"Unsolvable"},{"id":"56408662","title":"Dana Gilbert"},{"id":"56408672","text":"Arthur Legrand (28 October 1833 ‚Äì 8 May 1916) was a French lawyer, public servant and politician who represented Manche in the legislature almost continuously from 1871 to his death in 1916.

He was one of the ten original founders of the Appel au peuple parliamentary group. He was appointed to committees on railways, canals, markets, the Bank of France and the Sacr√© C≈ìur of Montmartre, for which he submitted a draft that became law. He submitted many legal proposals concerning primary education, the merchant navy, gendarmes, distillers and a Postal Savings Bank. He voted for the repeal of the laws of exile, for the bishops' petition, against the three-year military service, for the resignation of Adolphe Thiers, for the decree against civil burials, for the seven-year presidential term, against the amendment proposed by Henri- Alexandre Wallon, against the constitutional laws and for the law on higher education.

Structure of the story The writer cast herself as part of the book, writing about being invited by the municipality to write about the city. Further on, her task gets renamed as town clerk, which was more fitting given the medieval circumstances Almere fell into. In Maastricht she bid farewell to her loved ones, since she'd retreat to a place where nobody wanted to be found dead.Daar Wilde Je Toch Niet Dood Gevonden Worden?  The two extraordinary events in Almere  * On the Sunday of Renate's arrival there is an apocalyptic summer storm on the city. Violent hail and incessant thunderstorms with gusts of up to 250 km per hour. On the Monday the damage seems to be relatively low. The KNMI completely missed the storm but on Monday the commuters leave the city again with some delay by train and car to their work, as far as they were not on holiday. * While the repair work starts on Monday, the electricity is completely switched off after a flash of light. Soon it appears that the power never returns via the electricity grid. The city falls back to medieval conditions. Moreover, the city is completely enclosed by a dense fog on its municipal boundaries. People leave from Almere but nobody comes back into the city. In this, the story shows similarities to the novel of Stephen King: 'Under the Dome'  Fate of Almere  Most residents of Almere believe their city is the only one that has survived the end of the world. This is because all connections to the world outside of Almere are severed and nobody is coming back into the city. The population is rapidly falling from around 200,000 to 5,000, mostly women. Infectious diseases such as cholera, Typhus and diphtheria claim their merciless toll. Yet there is also an undercurrent, worded by Lazaar Lazaar, who thinks that a central government undertook a horrible experiment with the city, which was once won from water. The climate has become tropical and the days are equally long all year round and the twilight is correspondingly short. In particular, young men run fast through the fog banks surrounding the municipal territory.  Course of the story  After the two disasters, the city council is taken over by the only remaining alderman of Culture and three obscure PVV council members. After his death, the head of the prison takes his place. Renate is also closely involved in decision-making as a city writer. Due to the loss of electricity and a lack of men, the standard of living falls back quickly. Food is becoming a problem, even though the city had opportunities to provide food for its 200,000 inhabitants, it is now unable to feed 5000. The escaped 300 male detainees turn out to be both a curse and a blessing. They are divided into useful (200) and scum (100) by the prison director. The last group withdraws voluntarily in 'The Castle' and terrorizes from there to an increasingly lesser extent the population, which has largely withdrawn in Almere Centrum around the Weerwater. The usable prisoners are appointed as the head of 200 clans, called 'Close Family', in which alternative families are formed by lottery. Large themes for the survivors are growing food and making babies, which is almost hopeless with malnourished women. Moreover, the major life demand that remains outside Almere remains unresolved for all residents. The discovery of an approximately six months old baby girl Ally suggests that there is still life outside of Almere. It is unclear, however, how it is that the city is not undermined after the power grid has failed. Clan heads take control of the city and find their old prison director willing to test whether the fog wall still prevents return to the city. If this Jacob Krikke does not return, a more positive mood returns to the city. The survivors still stand alone. As city writer, Renate sends a message to the outside world via bottle mail.

Courts on state and federal levels almost never recognize such as inappropriate, as doing so would in essence, condone perjury. As an example, suppose that a person committed a crime for which they were never prosecuted, but the statute of limitations on that crime has expired. A prosecutor could set a perjury trap for them by calling them as a witness before a grand jury in a case about a different crime, and ask them about the expired crime. If the witness lies about the expired crime, that would be perjury‚Äîa new crime, which could then be prosecuted. Prosecution for perjury elicited in this manner violates due process of law, since the investigatory powers of the grand jury are exploited to reach beyond their legal limits. It has been argued by legal scholars whether it constitutes a form of entrapment. Claims of a perjury trap are common when perjury charges result from testimony before a grand jury, but are rarely proven. No US federal court has ever accepted a motion to dismiss because of claimed perjury trap. The defense is extremely difficult, because the question that elicited the perjured testimony must be immaterial to the case in which it was asked, and courts construe very broadly what questions count as material to a case.

Early life Born in Kirmond le Mire in Lincolnshire, Badlay worked full-time on a farm from the age of eight. He taught himself to read, and soon moved to Leeds, where he initially sold hay, before finding work in insurance. He then worked for a bookshop in Huddersfield, before setting up his own bookshop in Leeds. Badlay joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1895, and soon became president of its Leeds branch. He stood for Leeds City Council in the West ward in 1896, taking only 7.5% of the vote. His next candidacy was in 1905 in East Hunslet, when he was elected as a Labour Representation Committee candidate. Leadership of the Labour group Badlay held his council seat for the Labour Party in 1908. At this time, the Labour group was led by John Buckle, who resented the influence of the ILP. In 1908, Buckle resigned in protest at the group refusing to meet with the King and Queen when they visited the city. Badlay was elected as his replacement, and oversaw Buckle's expulsion from the party. His time leading the group was, in retrospect, considered a success. While his personal style has been criticised by Michael Meadowcroft as \\"somewhat theatrical\\", he has also been praised for maintaining his radicalism and, on one occasion, speaking non-stop for three hours in opposition to a Conservative Party proposal. At times, he made controversial statements, and in 1912 he was successfully sued for libel by the Liberal Joseph Henry. At the December 1910 United Kingdom general election, Badlay stood in Leeds South, Buckle had been readmitted to the party but still held a grudge against Badlay. He challenged Badlay's eligibility to stand for the party, claiming that Badlay had not maintained membership of a trade union, but this was rejected. However, the campaign was short of finance and poorly organised, and he took third place with 21.5% of the vote. That year, he also became an alderman on the council. In 1912, Badlay was appointed as full-time organiser for a trade union, and then from 1913 became a director of the Royal Liver Friendly Society. This was considered incompatible with remaining a Labour councillor, and he was forced to resign as Labour leader in August, standing down as an alderman in November. His successors as Labour leader, George Pearson and then John Arnott, focused on making Labour appear administratively competent, but were criticised in the party's own newspaper, which stated that \\"...since John Badlay left, [the Conservatives] have had the happiest time making fools of the Labour Party in all manners possible\\". Later life Badlay relocated to Liverpool, where he found the local ILP more amenable to his directorship, and he served on Liverpool City Council from 1919 to 1922. He also acted as treasurer of the Association of Collecting Friendly Societies. At the 1922 United Kingdom general election, he stood in Leeds North East, taking another third place, this time with 24.4% of the vote. He retired in 1931, and returned to Leeds, where he was re-elected to the council, becoming an alderman again in 1933. In 1937, he was elected as Lord Mayor of Leeds. In 1940, a Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) event in opposition to World War II was organised at Leeds Town Hall. Badlay argued against the ban and, in response, he was expelled from the Labour Party. He remained on the council as an independent, although Graham Stevenson argues that he probably joined the CPGB. He died in 1944, still in office.

It is a nonvolatile liquid at room temperature, with a boiling point of . Its structure consists of two cyclohexane rings joined by a single carbon-carbon bond. Production Carbazole can be denitrogenated by hydrogen to yield bicyclohexyl as the main product. When cyclohexane is exposed to radiation, bicyclohexyl is produced among other hydrocarbons. Properties The molecule is not completely flat, and the two rings are twisted compared to each other. Liquid bicyclohexyl contains a mixture of molecules with C2 and C2h symmetry termed ee anti, and ee gauche. The carbon-carbon bond (pivot) between the rings is 1.55 √Ö, and the carbon-carbon length in the rings is 1.535 √Ö and carbon-hydrogen bond length is 1.102 √Ö. The torsion angle between the rings is 74.9¬∞. The C-C-C bond angle ‚à† is about 111¬∞ and C-C-H angle is 109¬∞. The speed of sound in bicyclohexyl is 1441.51 m/s, higher than many other hydrocarbons. The density is 882.73 kgm‚àí1. The isothermal compressibility is 674 TPa‚àí1 and isobaric expansivity is 819 K‚àí1. When bicyclohexyl is heated to around it slowly decomposes to cyclohexane and cyclohexene, as the pivot bond joining the two rings is the longest and weakest one. Heat of combustion is 1814.8 kcal/mol.

First described by Eduard Sandifort in 1779, carpal coalitions are often an isolated issue which connect two carpal bones in the same row of the wrist. These issues are congenital and occur at various rates throughout the population. Signs and symptoms Patients with carpal coalition often offer no clinical significance and patients rarely have any associated issues. Though infrequent, some patients may complain of pain. Causes Carpal coalition result from an incomplete separation of a common embryological carpal precursor in utero, during the fifth to eighth weeks. Subtypes An example of a coalition between the trapezoid and capitate carpal bones The lunate and triquetral bones are the most common carpal bones to fuse together, resulting in a lunotriquetral coalition in 1% of people. 60% of patients with a lunotriquetral coalition will have it bilaterally. Among isolated incidents the capitate and hamate bones are the next most common to fuse followed by the pisiform-triquetrum, trapezium-trapezoid, scaphoid-capitate, and triquetrum-hamate. Carpal coalitions may further be divided into four subtypes: * Type 1 - incomplete fusion with pseudoarthrosis * Type 2 - fusion with a \\"notch\\" between the fused bones * Type 3 - complete fusion * Type 4 - complete fusion with other anomalies present Treatment Generally since carpal-carpal fusions do not cause unease or discomfort for the patient, and do not impair wrist function, treatment is not needed. However, in the minority of cases where carpal coalition causes persistent pain, arthrodesis, or the introduction of a joint via surgery, has been proven to be beneficial. Epidemiology Carpal coalition occurs at a ratio of 2:1 in females, and are considered to have a multifactorial inheritance pattern. Further, the incidence according to race varies, with a rate of 0.1% in Caucasian populations, 1.6% in African American populations, and over 8% in certain West African tribes. Associated problems Multiple carpal coalitions, or carpal coalitions that connect the two different rows of carpal muscles, are often associated with other anomalies including: *Ellis-van Creveld syndrome *Holt-Oram syndrome *Turner's syndrome See also *Tarsal coalition References Congenital disorders of musculoskeletal system Wrist ","title":"Carpal coalition"},{"id":"56409594","text":"Jeƒºena Ostapenko and Alicja Rosolska were the defending champions, but Ostapenko chose not to participate this year.

Once built, it will be the home of AFC Wimbledon. The club anticipates playing its first match at the stadium on 3 November 2020.  History  Wimbledon F.C. played its matches at Plough Lane stadium, only 200 yards from the current site until 1991, when it began a ground-share with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, with the intention of moving to a new all-seater stadium elsewhere at a later date due to the original Plough Lane stadium being unsuitable for conversion into a modern all-seater stadium. Numerous locations within and beyond the borders of Merton were considered for a possible new stadium, but none of these came to fruition, and in 2003 the original Wimbledon club relocated 70 miles north to Milton Keynes, being rebranded as Milton Keynes Dons the following year. In 2002 a phoenix club, AFC Wimbledon was formed by a section of the club's supporters after the Football League gave Wimbledon permission to move to Milton Keynes. In the meantime, Wimbledon have played at Kingsmeadow Stadium, the home of Kingstonian. Since its inception, AFC Wimbledon stated that one of its primary aims was to return to Merton, with a new stadium close to what it regards as its \\"spiritual home\\" of the original Plough Lane. This aim formed the basis of a project to create a new purpose-built stadium on the site of the Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium, located approximately 200 yards (and just across the River Wandle) from Plough Lane, where the original Wimbledon side played for 80 years. Plans to develop the greyhound site as either a multi- purpose stadium or as a football stadium were publicised frequently by the club and the media prior to 2013. In 2013 AFC Wimbledon announced that discussions were underway with Merton Council over a joint bid for the greyhound stadium and surrounding land, in cooperation with developer Galliard Homes, to build a new football stadium, 600 residential units and a wide range of shops and community facilities.  Development  Construction proceeded with the permanent west stand initially, with main entry from the south off Plough Lane. This will be a four-story structure with general admission access from the first floor, and hospitality above. This structure will seat about 4,500 spectators; semi-permanent stands on the other three sides will bring initial capacity to 9,000. Among the semi-permanent seating, the most vocal home fans will be in the south, which is also expected to include a safe standing area; a family area along the east; and away fans will be in the north stand, which is isolated with its own entry. The plans for the football stadium were approved unanimously by Merton Council on 10 December 2015. Clearance of the site in preparation for the new football stadium and housing was begun on 16 March 2018. The stadium's opening was initially planned for summer 2019, but the current target is the start of the 2020-21 season. The land's freehold was transferred to an AFC Wimbledon subsidiary on 24 December 2018, among other transactions that also formally transferred ownership of Kingsmeadow, AFC Wimbledon's current ground, to Chelsea. = Finances = The club thus purchased and cleared the site of the former Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium in anticipation of construction. In 2019 it was announced that a minimum of ¬£2 million in crowdfunding would be needed to construct a scaled- down version of the original design with a single permanent stand and an initial capacity of 9,000; as of August 2019, the ¬£2 million mark had been passed through Seedrs. However, in November 2019 it emerged that financing of a final ¬£11m needed to complete the ground as envisioned was not forthcoming; the club's fan ownership considered scaling down the project, or accepting outside investment to meet the shortfall. However, alternate financing eventually came together by way of a bond issue. In May 2020, the final financing needed to sign all construction contracts was confirmed following key investment from local businessman Nick Robertson.  Opening  AFC Wimbledon is projected to play their first match at the ground on 3 November 2020.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to twenty small, dark purple flowers. It grows in a montane and subalpine grassland and forest in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. Description Genoplesium arrectum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between three and twenty dark purple flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall and taller than the leaf. The flowers are about long, wide and are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is a broad egg shape, about long and wide with hairless edges and dark coloured bands. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide, stiffly erect and more or less parallel to each other. The petals are a narrow egg shape, about long and wide with dark coloured bands and hairless edges. The labellum is elliptic to broadly egg-shaped, about long, wide, thick and fleshy with coarse hairs on its edges. There is an narrow egg-shaped callus in the centre of the labellum and extending three-quarters of the way to its tip. Flowering occurs in December and January. Taxonomy and naming Genoplesium arrectum was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Omeo and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. In 2002 Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis arrecta. The specific epithet (arrecta) is a Latin word meaning \\"upright\\", referring to the stiffly erect lateral sepals.

It was South Korea's deadliest fire in nearly a decade. The fire occurred one month after 29 people died in a gym fire in the city of Jecheon. The cause of the fire is under investigation.  Hospitals  The Sejong Hospital and adjacent Sejong Nursing Hospital were established in 2008 by the Hyoseong Medical Foundation. The Sejong Hospital is a large general hospital; the hospital and the Sejong Nursing Hospital have 95 beds and 98 beds respectively with 27 medical staff each. The Sejong Hospital was not required to install fire sprinklers based on its aggregate area, whereas in the Sejong Nursing Hospital, sprinklers were required to be installed after the relevant law was revised and were planned to be installed by 30 June.  Incident  The fire began on the first floor of the Sejong Hospital at 7:35a.m.(KST). At the time, there were over 100 patients in the main hospital and 94 in the adjacent nursing home complex. Two nurses stated that they had seen fire suddenly erupting in the emergency room, immediately triggering an evacuation process throughout the hospital and nursing home. As the fire began to spread through the first level of the main hospital, large volumes of smoke spread into the upper floors. By the time firefighters arrived, 25 people were already dead. Firefighters worked through thick smoke to save patients, including 15 patients from the third floor intensive care unit under the supervision of hospital staff. Shortly after the fire began, local Miryang resident Jeong Dong Hwa mounted a rescue effort that saved the lives of ten people who were trapped on the hospital's fifth floor. Jeong's brother-in-law and sister-in-law also participated in rescue efforts to help save the lives of people trapped on the third floor. The fire was brought under control after 9:30a.m.(KST). =Victims= The fire killed 41 people and injured 153. Among the 41 deaths were one doctor, one nurse and one assistant nurse. Thirty people were over 70 years old. Jeong's 88-year-old mother-in-law was found alive on the third floor but died the following day. Response In the immediate aftermath of the fire, South Korean President Moon Jae-in called an emergency meeting, ordering emergency officials in and around the area to continue focusing life-saving support on the evacuated patients. Senior officials from both ruling and opposition parties traveled to the area to offer their condolences to victims and families. Ruling Democratic Party spokeswoman Kim Hyun urged authorities \\"to mobilize all available personnel and equipment to handle the aftermath\\" while Liberty Korea Party spokesman Choung Tae-ok demanded no negligence in rescue operations. Referencing the Jecheon fire disaster from the previous December, People's Party spokeswoman Lee Heang-Ja stated members felt \\"deeply saddened that a fire occurred again when the citizens' sorrow of the Jecheon fire still lingers.\\" For his heroic rescue efforts, Jeong was honored with the President's Award by President Moon.

Omagh St. Enda's defeated Ardboe O'Donovan Rossa in a first round re- fixture tie in the Athletic Grounds, Armagh. Healy Park was ruled out due to Omagh's involvement and no neutral floodlit venue was available. Greencastle St. Patrick's made the drop back down to the Intermediate ranks when finishing bottom of the 2017 S.F.L. They were followed by Strabane Sigersons who lost their S.F.L.

Format The championship has a straight knock out structure. The 16 teams that take part in the championship are the 16 teams in the Senior Football League (SFL). Relegation from SFC: Either two or three teams are relegated each year from the SFC and SFL. The 16th placed team in the SFL is automatically relegated to the IFL. The 15th and 14th placed teams then play a SFL relegation playoff with the loser being relegated. The winner plays the winner of the IFL promotion playoffs - if they win, they remain in the SFC and SFL - if they lose they are relegated to the IFC and IFL. (The winner of the SFC can't be relegated. If the championship winner finishes in the bottom 3 in the league, the 13th placed team enters the relegation scenario.) Promotion to SFC: Either two or three teams are promoted to the SFC each year. The IFC champions and the IFL champions are automatically promoted to the senior grade (If a team wins the IFC and IFL, the 2nd placed team in the IFL are automatically promoted). 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th place in the IFL enter the IFL promotion semi-finals (If the IFC champions are placed in the top 5 the 6th placed team enter the IFL promotion semi- finals) with the eventual winner of the final earning the right to play the loser of the SFL relegation playoff in a relegation/promotion playoff.

He was a chief of the Batlhaping ba Manyeding group of the Batswana in Kuruman. He was born in Kimberley, South Africa in 1835 and was the son of a Christian convert. Jantjie spent most of his life protecting the rights to land of his people and is considered a struggle hero for his battle against British colonialism. He was the cousin of Kgosi Galeshewe. Resistance and conflict When diamonds were discovered in Kimberley in 1871, British colonists from the Cape Colony swarmed onto Jantjie's land in search of diamonds and took it over. Jantjie and his people were the first local people whose ancestral land was stolen from them due to diamond prospecting by colonists. Jantjie was outspoken against the land invasion, however, he initially took a non-violent approach towards the British which included boycotting the rural trading stores. In addition, Jantjie fought for his people to attain equal rights to purchase diamond licenses so that they could share in the wealth that was being excavated on their land. However, the government of the Cape Colony refused to grant mining rights to native groups. Jantjie took up arms in response and orchestrated skirmishes against the British. Jantjie's confrontations with British authorities earned him the epithet of being ‚Äúa wild fellow who hates the English‚Äù. Over the next decade, the Batlhaping, Tlharo and Rolong people were evicted from much of their land and confined to reserves. In 1895, the area was annexed by the Cape Colony which resulted in Tswana groups being moved to even smaller reserves. These groups were also forced to pay taxes such as the hut tax, to work on white farms, and as migrant mine workers for the Kimberley mine. In addition the Rinderpest regulations and the shooting of cattle owned by Africans in the Taung Reserves were undertaken. After Jantjie's cattle were shot, he demanded of the policeman in charge, Corporal Denyssen, to know why his cattle were shot. He was shown a policy on Rinderpest and cattle roaming out of the owner's territory. He then demanded compensation from the corporal, which was refused. These events sparked the Langeberg Rebellion. The rebellion was led by Batlhaping chief Kgosi Galeshewe.  Death and Significance  In August 1897, the colonial police invaded the Langeberg Mountains where Jantjie and other rebels had orchestrated a last stand. Jantjie was discovered by Temple Smythe, a member of the Cape Medical Staff Corps, in a cave on the Gamasep Kopje near Olifantshoek. Jantjie opened fire upon Smythe's approach, however, his gun misfired. Smythe took this opportunity and shot Jantjie in the head with a revolver. As a sign of humiliation and a warning to other rebels, it was reported that, while Jantjie was dying, Smythe and his troops posed to take photos with him. When Jantjie died, the British troops decapitated his corpse and took his head as a trophy. Jantjie's death is regarded as the collapse of the Tswana resistance. In the aftermath, 4 000 men, women and children of the Bwere were taken captive and sent to the Cape Colony to work as unpaid labour for local white farmers. Many of the rebels were hanged for their contribution in orchestrating the rebellion. The rebellion officially ended on 3 August 1897 following the death of over 1 500 men. Currently there is no record of where Jantjie's remains are buried, nor the fate of his skull. In 2011 the book Luka Jantjie: Resistance Hero of the South African Frontier was published. Authored by Kevin Shillington, the book recounts Jantjie's legacy and contributions. In April 2016, a building on Sol Plaatje University campus, Kimberley, was renamed Luka Jantjie House in Jantjie's honor.

Hugel (May 23, 1925 ‚Äì February 19, 2007) was an American businessman and political figure. He worked on Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, and briefly served as Deputy Director for Operations of the Central Intelligence Agency before resigning amidst allegations of improper stock trading. He later became a co-owner of the historic Rockingham Park in Salem, New Hampshire, and at the time of his death was chairman of Carmen Group, a Washington D.C. lobbying firm. He died of cancer at his home in Ocala, Florida, at the age of 81. Hugel was born in the Bronx, New York, and was drafted into the U.S. Army at 18, (Archival copy) serving from 1943 to 1947. He attended the Military Intelligence School at the University of Michigan, where he became fluent in Japanese, and became a first lieutenant in Military Intelligence. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1953, and became president and CEO of Brother International Corporation from 1954 to 1975, and executive vice president and chief operating officer of Centronics Computer Corporation from 1975 to 1980. He was recruited by Ronald Reagan to assist in his New Hampshire primary campaign and later chaired the national voters group of the Reagan campaign. After Reagan's election, Hugel led the Small Business Administration during the presidential transition. Hugel was a close friend of William J. Casey, the director of the CIA. Hugel joined the CIA in January 1981 as Casey's special assistant, and Casey later appointed him as Deputy Director for Operations, the head of the CIA's Clandestine Service. After reporters from the Washington Post published allegations by two former business associates of improper or illegal stock trading during Hugel's time with Brother International, Hugel resigned while denying the allegations. He later sued the two associates for libel, and won. In 1983 Hugel joined with three business partners to purchase the Rockingham Park racetrack in New Hampshire and rebuild it following a fire. He was also a breeder and owner of racehorses. Hugel was married and had four children.

It most common west of the Appalachian Mountains and east of the Mississippi River, where it is found in the Midwest, Upper South and in Ontario. Its natural habitat is in dry, open areas, such as outcrops, glades, and barrens. Opuntia cespitosa is a prostrate succulent shrub, usually no more than 1-2 segments tall. It has large white spines, and a low layer of reddish-brown glochids, which break off in the skin if touched. It produces a yellow and red flower in late spring. This species was historically included in a broadly-defined Opuntia humifusa group, which is found further to the east. Opuntia cespitosa differs from Opuntia humifusa in its flowers having a red center.Opuntia cespitosa Opuntia Web, accessed 25 January 2018 References cespitosa ","title":"Opuntia cespitosa"},{"id":"56410610","text":"Harpalini is a tribe of a diverse group of ground beetles belonging to the subfamily Harpalinae within the broader family Carabidae.
