He is frequently grouped with other composers as part of the Indianist movement in American music. Born in Philadelphia, Orem received his secondary education at the Eastburn Academy, and did his undergraduate work at the University of Pennsylvania, where he received his degree in music. He studied organ and music theory with Hugh Archibald Clarke, and was instructed in piano by Charles H. Jarvis. From 1889 until 1895 he served as the organist of St. Paul's Procathedral in Los Angeles; after this he returned home, teaching for one year at the Philadelphia Conservatory. From 1896 until 1905 he taught at the Combs Conservatory of Music. In 1900 Orem began a long association with Theodore Presser, serving as a music critic and editor for the publisher while conducting the Presser Choral Society. From 1901 until 1910 he again worked as an organist, this time at the Walnut Street Presbyterian Church. Orem also wrote theory books, including 1919's Harmony Book for Beginners, and compiled nine books of musical exercises. It is for these that he is chiefly remembered. As a composer, Orem was less interested than many of his contemporaries in the Indianist movement; still, as it was in fashion, it seems to have held a certain fascination for him. He is numbered among its members mainly because of his American Indian Rhapsody, his most popular work. Originally written for piano, but later scored for full orchestra, it contains reference to the music of the Cheyenne, Kiowa, Sioux, Chippewa, Pueblo, and Cree tribes, and is based on themes recorded and suggested by Thurlow Lieurance. The Rhapsody has been described as > very much a period piece, stylistically conventional and eclectic, post- > Romantic and neo-Lisztian in its mannerisms and pretentiousness, its > plethora of trills, arpeggios, broken chords, and repeated octaves (often > thunderous), and its bravura display of virtuosity, with indications ranging > from molto maestoso to allegretto scherzando, from andante affetuoso to > allegro con brio, from amabile to feroce (the savage!). It is probably the > most far-out Indianist composition ever written. Orem composed other works as well, including a piano quartet, a quintet, large numbers of songs, some works for piano, and numerous transcriptions and arrangements; among the latter is a movement from one of Johann Sebastian Bach's solo cello suites, arranged for organ. Orem died in Philadelphia in 1938. A handful of Orem's piano works have been recorded by Naxos Records for release on the Marco Polo label, as part of a series documenting the work of Indianist composers. In addition, the piano version of the American Indian Rhapsody may be found on a New World Records release of American romantic piano music. Orem was credited by the Summy Company in 1935 with co-authoring the song - Happy Birthday to You.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 180 in 2000. Geography Wildorado is located along FM 809 south of and Main Street north of Interstate 40, east of Vega, the county seat of Oldham County.Rand McNally. The Road Atlas '08. Chicago: Rand McNally, 2008, p. 98. The nearest large city is Amarillo, located approximately 20 miles east of Wildorado. Wildorado's elevation is 3,921 feet (1,195 m). History Named for nearby Wildorado Creek, the community was founded in 1900 as a railway town along the Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railroad. It was first settled by Eugene Binford and John R. Goodman, who ranched in the area before 1900. A post office was established in 1904. In 1908, the railroad was completed and a town site was laid out. Goodman organized the Wildorado State Bank and built the Wildorado Hotel. A newspaper, the Wildorado Progress, began publication in 1909. By 1915, Wildorado had an estimated population of 100. During the 1920s and 1930s, the community endured droughts and dust storms. In 1936, Wildorado had a population of 57 with seven businesses. That figure increased to around 125 residents in the late 1940s. The gradual evolution of the Ozark Trail (Route 66) into Interstate 40 encouraged growth. After World War II, when travel became a popular past time, Wildorado responded with services along its portion of Route 66 and the population rose to over 200 by the late 1950s. The formation of the Wildorado Water Supply Corporation in 1976-77 ensured a rural water supply and irrigation wells. During the latter half of the twentieth century, the population hovered around 180. Although Wildorado is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 79098.Zip Code Lookup Education Public education is provided by the Wildorado Independent School District. Troy Duck is the district's superintendent. The district has a single campus that serves students in grades prekindergarten through eighth. Wildorado ISD is rated an Exemplary District by the Texas Education Agency. Wildorado Elementary accepts transfers and provides transportation by bus for accepted students. Students in grades 9-12 attend one of the nearby neighboring districts. The new high school that is in operation will expand a grade each year until they run through the 12th grade. The first graduating class will be in 2021.

Stevens plant in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina on May 30, 1973 for \\"insubordination\\" after she copied an anti-union letter posted on the company bulletin board. Union activism and recognition Sutton was one of the union activists during the J.P. Stevens controversy‚Äîone of \\"the ugliest episodes in labor history in the United States which took place from about 1963 to 1980\\" during which Stevens \\"repeatedly harassed or fired union activists\\" and the union \\"countered with a boycott of Stevens products\\" and a \\"campaign to isolate the company by pressuring companies that dealt with Stevens or had Stevens officers on their boards.\\" In 1973 Crystal saw a union poster hanging in one of the seven mills in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina owned by J.P. Stevens & Company mills where three generations of her family had worked‚Äîliving in a neighborhood where the Company \\"owned every shotgun house\\" in Sutton's neighborhood. She had been \\"thinking about the paltry wages, the bone-tiring work and the stingy benefits that she and her parents had suffered. She wanted something better for her children.\\" In 1978 Sutton was fired after trying to unionize employees. Shortly after, by August 28, 1978, Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) began to represent workers at the plant. The Textile Workers Union of America sent union organizer Eli Zivkovich to unionize J.P. Stevens & Company's Roanoke Rapids mills employees and worked with Sutton. He said \\"in his 20 years as an organizer he had never known anyone who matched Sutton‚Äôs zeal.\\" ‚ÄúManagement and others treated me as if I had leprosy,‚Äù she stated.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2009/09/15/AR2009091503323.html Sutton earned $2.65 per hour folding towels (). She received threats and was finally fired from her job. But before she left, she took one final stand, filmed in Norma Rae. ‚ÄúI took a piece of cardboard and wrote the word UNION on it in big letters, got up on my work table, and slowly turned it around. The workers started cutting their machines off and giving me the victory sign. All of a sudden the plant was very quiet‚Ä¶‚Äù\\"Welcome to the Crystal Sutton Collection\\" Official website of Crystal Lee Sutton Sutton was physically removed from the plant by police, but she achieved her goal. On August 28, 1978, the 3,133 workers at the Roanoke Rapids plant voted to allow The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to represent them by a slim 237 vote margin. However, because of the intractability of J.P. Stevens, workers at the plant continued without a contract until 1980. Thanks to a coalition of black and white women employees of the mill, Sutton's national speaking tour, and local organizing on behalf of workers among religious groups, J.P. Stevens and ACTWU agreed to a settlement in 1980. Sutton became a paid organizer for the ACTWU and went on a national speaking tour as \\"the real Norma Rae.\\" Sutton was the 13th recipient of the Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award in 1980. The honor was named after a 1963 encyclical letter, Pacem in terris (Peace on Earth), by Pope John XXIII, that calls upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. Sutton complained that the ACTWU didn't support her after her arrest. She claimed union leaders \\"acted like they were ashamed to have ever had anything to do with Crystal Lee.\\" She said that when she was reinstated at J.P. Stevens, she was snubbed by the union organizer. \\"I mean, I walked into that mill that day and the organizer said he didn't even know who I was. There was nobody from the regional office. No press, nothing.\\" Two days later she took her accumulated sick days to demonstrate her value to the union. Eventually, she began working for the ACTWU directly, however. Norma Rae The 1979 film Norma Rae, starring Sally Field, is based on Sutton's early union work. The movie is based on the 1975 book about her by New York Times reporter Henry \\"Hank\\" Leifermann Crystal Lee: A Woman of Inheritance. Her papers and memorabilia are located at Alamance Community College in North Carolina, where she took classes in nursing in 1988. Personal life Sutton was born Crystal Lee Pulley in Roanoke Rapids on December 31, 1940. She married at 19, gave birth to her first child at 20, and was widowed at 21. She married Larry Jordan Jr. and had her third child at 25. Following the events that made her famous and before the release of Norma Rae, she and Jordan were divorced. She married Lewis Sutton Jr. about 1977. Obituaries state they were married 32 years. Death Crystal Lee Sutton died of inoperable brain cancer at Hospice Home in Burlington, North Carolina.

Katzer was a lawsuit between Robert Jacobsen (plaintiff) and Matthew Katzer (defendant), filed March 13, 2006 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The case addressed claims on copyright, patent invalidity, cybersquatting, and Digital Millennium Copyright Act issues arising from Jacobsen under an open source license developing control software for model trains. In ruling on summary judgment motions the Northern District Judge ruled that liability for an open source copyright violation nevertheless did not support Plaintiff's claim for damages. The Ruling rendered Plaintiff's claim pointless since the Plaintiff could not recover money damages. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial judge holding an open source copyright claim was enforceable and awarded damages. The case then settled on February 16, 2010. The case is noted for its contentiousness, with over 400 docket items (including motions, pleadings, as well as court orders) entered at the trial court, and two appeals to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The Jacobsen case is noteworthy in United States copyright law because Courts clarified the enforceability of licensing agreements on both open-source software and proprietary software. The case established the rule of law that terms and conditions of the Artistic License 1.0 are \\"enforceable copyright conditions\\".  Background  Jacobsen, a model railroad hobbyist and a programmer, started the Java Model Railroad Interface (JMRI) Project along with other software developersJMRI.org in 2000, on the open-source incubation website Sourceforge.net. The goal of the project was to create interfaces that would allow model trains to be controlled on a layout of model train tracks. The software created by the JMRI community was distributed without charge on the Internet, subject to the terms of the Artistic License. JMRI also sells custom software directly to modelers and to dealers for resale.Trainpriority.com JMRI's sales have qualified JMRI for membership as a business in the Model Railroad Industry Association (MRIA). Defendant Katzer is the owner of KAMIND Associates Inc., an Oregon company doing business under the name KAM Industries. KAM produced and sold beginning in 1997 a commercial product for model trains, Train Tools, based on client- server software. Katzer owns several patents that may apply to the model railroad industry, one of which he alleged the JMRI project may infringe. Jacobsen, however, alleged that Katzer's software utilizes textual files from the JMRI project, in violation of copyright and the DMCA. Katzer subsequently countersued Jacobsen for $6 million for copyright infringement. In addition to the patent claims, there was also a dispute over websites. In February 2004, Katzer registered the web domain decoderpro.com; however, DecoderPro is the trademarked name for a JMRI program. Jacobsen succeeded in obtaining the return of the domain name.  Litigation history   Initial actions  Both Jacobsen and Katzer moved for summary judgment and the district court ruled on the parties' Motions in December 2009.  Summary judgment  The summary judgment deals with a series of submissions presented by Jacobsen (plaintiff) and Katzer (defendant). Responses to initial submissions were filed on November 13. Both plaintiff and defendant further replied to responses on November 19 and 20. Prior to oral arguments on December 4, Judge Jeffrey S. White issued a Notice of Tentative Ruling and Questions, tentatively affirming in part and denying in part Jacobsen's motion for summary judgment and tentatively denying Katzer's motion for summary judgment. On December 10, 2009, the judge denied Katzer's motion, concluding that Jacobsen could copyright the selection and ordering of the decoder definition files and could show monetary damages for copyright infringement. In the same ruling, he granted in part and denied in part Jacobsen's motion, finding that Katzer did register the decoderpro.com domain name in bad faith, that Katzer is liable for copyright infringement of the decoder definition files and that Katzer's counterclaim for copyright infringement is barred by the doctrine of laches (damaged argument), and ruled that Jacobsen had a license under an \\"Implied License\\" doctrine. The judge did not rule on damages for copyright infringement and determined that the questions of Katzer's knowledge or intent in removing copyright notices are triable issues.  Settlement  The parties reached settlement on February 16, 2010, and the settlement paid on March 5, 2010. The basic terms of the Mutual Settlement Agreement included the Parties agreeing: # To a permanent injunction enjoining Katzer from \\"reproducing, by download or others, JMRI material, modifying JMRI material or distributing JMRI material\\". # The Settlement forever barred each other from pursuit of claims, known or unknown existing up to the settlement date. The Agreement pertained to \\"all claims based on or related to JMRI Material\\". This settlement term applied to JMRI, JMRI end-users, and JMRI developers to the date of settlement payment. # To dismiss all pending matters, including Federal Circuit appeal, Jacobsen v Katzer et al., No. 2009-1221. # Katzer/KAM agreed on a payment of $100,000 to Jacobsen. # The settlement agreement terminated all Oral and Implied licenses between parties. # Not to initiate legal proceedings against each other for 10 years, and to refer future disputes to arbitration. This applied only to Jacobsen and Katzer/KAM, not to JMRI, JMRI end users, or JMRI developers. # That the Settlement Agreement does not pertain to newly issued Katzer IP, or any later JMRI software versions, appearing after the settlement date As required by the Settlement Agreement, the defendant paid the plaintiff $100,000 on March 5, 2010.  Specific issues   Copyright claims  KAM received a copyright infringement notification from Jacobsen on September 11, 2006,Sourceforge.net and on the same day Jacobsen filed an amended complaint that included a claim for copyright infringement.JMRI.org On the same day KAM removed allegedly infringing materials from KAM's website. In Jacobsen's declaration, in support of a motion for a preliminary injunction, he specifically identified examples of alleged copyright infringement.JMRI.org In August 2007, the district court denied Jacobsen's request for declaratory judgment, holding that the \\"defendants' alleged violation of the conditions of the license may have constituted a breach of the nonexclusive license, but does not create liability for copyright infringement.\\" The judge stated that JMRI failed to allege claims that were the proximate cause of a breach of the Artistic License. In August 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the district court's ruling, holding that the terms of the Artistic License are enforceable copyright conditions, and sent the case back to the district court. The appeals court said, \\"Open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace that few could have imagined just a few decades ago,\\" and cited as examples \\"the GNU/Linux operating system, the Perl programming language, the Apache web server programs, the Firefox web browser, and a collaborative web-based encyclopedia called Wikipedia.\\" Professor Lawrence Lessig called the ruling \\"a very important victory\\" that applies to all open source licenses, and many other news organizations commented on the finding. In January 2009, the District Court again ruled on the preliminary motions, saying that it would hear Jacobsen's copyright claims but denying Jacobsen a preliminary injunction due to a lack of evidence showing any specific and actual harm. In June 2009, the Software Freedom Law Center filed an amicus brief before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) calling for injunctive relief for open source developers. In the brief, SFLC argues that a Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) developer whose license has been violated should be able to call upon the courts to prevent further infringing distributions. The brief outlines harm to developers, development communities, and project productivity related to open source license violations. Jacobsen based his case on an assertion of a copyright on behalf of a free software project that is otherwise extremely generous in granting permissions for downstream copying, modifying, and distributing its works.Cyberlawcases.com Jacobsen explains that the basis of his copyright claims is that 102 files defining 291 decoders of the 500 decoders available on the market are at issue in this claim. JMRI developers chose the decoders they found most interesting and useful, and then structured the resulting definition files in a unique way, not based upon manufacturer or NMRA approaches, but reflecting the judgment of the JMRI developers as to their preferred arrangement, particularly choosing an arrangement appropriate for integrating these files with the rest of the JMRI software.  Patent claims  Katzer asserted that after he shipped model train software that used a client/server protocol in July 1997, he filed a patent application within the United States one year statutory period,USPTO.gov Trainpriority.com namely in June 1998, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office,Google.com consisting of 53 method claims for client/server control of model trains by computer software.Rosenlaw.com On April 14, 2002, the JMRI project published a new capability in their code, over 4 years after KAM presented their client/server architecture, which allowed a computer to control the layout of a model railroad via a client/server protocol. On April 17, 2002, Katzer filed a continuation patent application, with a priority date back to 1998, with the patent office claiming those exact capabilities.Sourceforge.net On March 11, 2003 the patent office granted the patent (the \\"'329 patent\\") claiming those exact capabilities. Another model train software supplier, DigiToys Systems, produced software called WinLok, including functionality purported to be prior art. This information was provided to the file history of the '329 patent, which is the parent of the pending continuation patent. Manual Patent Examining Procedures 707.05 states \\"In all continuation and continuation-in- part applications, the parent applications should be reviewed for pertinent prior art.\\" Accordingly, the references cited by the two model railroad hobbyists were before the patent office in the '329 patent. On March 8, 2005, Katzer sent patent infringement letters and bills to Jacobsen, claiming that the code in the JMRI project infringed his patent, and that more than $200,000 was due for licensing fees of previously distributed versions of the project. Jacobsen filed for a declaratory judgment against Katzer.Sourceforge.net In it, Jacobsen alleged that the June 1998 patent is invalid due to prior art, that Katzer deliberately failed to provide the patent office with the prior art, and that Katzer's patents had been granted by the patent office in error. On February 1, 2009, Katzer filed two disclaimers with the U.S. Patent Office, effectively making two of his patents unenforceable in their entirety. The result of the disclaimer was to remove all patent issues from the case. KAM stated that the disclaimer of the '329 patent was purely based upon economic considerations to avoid the cost of patent litigationJMRI.org  Cybersquatting claims  In July 2001, JMRI began calling one of its subprojects \\"DecoderPro.\\". In February 2004, Katzer purchased the domain decoderpro.com. After this was mentioned on a (non-JMRI) model railroad software mailing list,Yahoo! Groups Jerry Britton (a JMRI user/member) purchased and began using the domain name computerdispatcherpro.com, in apparent violation of Katzer's trademark on Computer Dispatcher. He also threatened to point KAM's computerdispatcherpro.com to a \\"good porn site\\". Katzer sued Britton to force him to stop infringing on the computerdispatcherpro.com trademark, and prevent Britton from pointing the domain name to such a site, and Jacobsen asked Katzer to transfer the decoderpro.com domain to him. A settlement agreement between Britton and Katzer resulted in Britton transferring computerdispatcherpro.com to Katzer, and Katzer in turn transferring decoderpro.com to Britton. The agreement allowed Britton to point the domain to the JMRI decoderpro project site, but also prohibited Britton from transferring the domain name without Katzer's permission. Jacobsen included a demand for return of decoderpro.com in his lawsuit against Katzer. He also filed an action with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) against fellow JMRI user Jerry Britton, asking that they settle the matter per the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDNDP); Britton did not respond to the action. On July 26, 2007, WIPO found in favor of Jacobsen, ruling that Katzer's actions were found to be in \\"bad faith\\", since \\"there was essentially a purpose on the part of Katzer to disrupt the business of a competitor by interfering with Complainant's exercise of his trademark rights\\". In the December 2009 Summary Judgement decision, the Federal Court concurred that Katzer had illegally cybersquatted on the decoderpro.com domain name.  Digital Millennium Copyright Act claims  In his second amended complaint against Katzer, Jacobsen included a section alleging that Katzer violated section 102 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act by removing or altered copyright management information. In response, Katzer filed a motion to dismiss the DMCA claims, stating that \\"information [that] does not encrypt or control access ... but ... 'functions to inform people who make copyright decisions\\" did not fall under the DMCA. However, in December 2009, the court ruled that Katzer's removal of the JMRI copyright information was a removal of copyright management information under the DMCA, leaving the question of intent under the DMCA, and damages under the DMCA to be proved at trial.

Historic Decatur Cemetery is located to the north, and affluent Glynnwood Estates, developed in 1927, and Glenwood school border Ponce de Leon Court on the east. Ponce de Leon Court is a local historic district in the city of Decatur, and was listed in the Georgia Register of Historic Places in June 2010. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on November 2, 2011. The single-street district includes approximately 26 parcels, and was based on a subdivision plat developed by John L. Womack in the 1920s. Womack reportedly wanted homes on this street to remind him of the tropics, so he planted both palm trees and banana trees. The palm trees flourished, but the banana trees died.\\" \\" Atlanta Journal Constitution, 23 FEB 1995\\" Retrieved: 18 August 2008. In the twenty-first century, residents successfully reintroduced banana trees on the north end of the street thanks to a change in the microclimate. The Womack family still owned property on the court when it was designated a historic district. The closely spaced homes on the narrow street are within walking distance of downtown Decatur, and were constructed in an era when developments did not plan adequately for the automobile. The sense of scale and detail created a strong sense of community, and resulted in this street being recognized as a unique asset in Decatur. Ponce de Leon Court primarily includes 1920s-era American Craftsman bungalows, but also has a few historic multi-family homes. Both the single- and multi-family structures, as well as historic palm trees, have remained largely intact from the era when they were built. The street consists entirely of homes. There are no churches, businesses, or apartment blocks. References * Clark, Caroline McKinney. The story of Decatur, 1823-1899.

It won many awards after release and sold 54,000 units. It is notable for longevity, with used models still actively traded on eBay a decade later, despite the difficulty of adapting the monitor to run with modern video cards, due to the 1600SW's OpenLDI video interface. Formac sold the same monitor bundled with its own OpenLDI graphics adapter as Formac ProNitron 18/500. Radius sold the monitor as the Artica which differed mainly in having a translucent white case and a conventional mount. SGI sold the monitor primarily under Model #AM173Y01. The 1600SW was revolutionary for its time, featuring a 17.3 inch diagonal wide screen panel in a market then dominated by CRT monitors. The 1600SW had a 25:16 aspect ratio (referred to by SGI as SuperWide) with a resolution of 1600 x 1024 pixels. The refresh rate was 60 Hz in 24-bit color and 110 dpi (which makes for a smaller dot pitch than most competitive monitors). The 1600SW shared the same styling motif as the SGI Visual Workstation 320, 540 and O2, with a unique (and troublesome) off-center mount. The display won a dozen international awards and despite its age, it still compares well to modern displays produced a decade later. At introduction the 1600SW cost in the neighborhood of $2500.

Adapting the 1600SW to Modern Video Cards OpenLDI is rarely used today, as all popular home and office LCD panel monitors use a DVI or VGA standard connector. There are several companies that make adapter boxes which allow continued use of these older displays. All of these adapters were developed for the 1600SW monitor: * SGI Multilink Adapter (VGA or DVI) (discontinued) * Dr. Bott SGI-Saver (DVI) * GFX-1600SWhttp://niktec.com/ProductInfo.aspx?id=5191458 sold by Niktec (DVI adapter, in passive PCI form factor, also sold built into 1600SW monitors) SGI referred to video cards that support the 1600SW's 1600 x 1024 resolution as Super Wide Savvy. Most modern cards have no trouble with this resolution, but on PC based machines, problems and screen distortion can exist during system boot. Apple Macintoshes boot directly into the proper resolution. Thus, with a little work, the 1600SW can be adapted to almost any modern computer. Repair According to the original SGI project manager Dan Evanicky, the most common failure items are backlights and power supplies. At this point Dan expects that any power supply in continuous use will have failed, though the monitor itself is likely fine. Monitors left on continuous for a decade or more likely have faded backlights. Generic power supplies work on the unit, specifications are: 3 amps at 12 volts with a 5.5m x 2.5mm center positive coaxial barrel (preferably right angle). In 2005 Mr. Evanicky purchased the entire spares inventory sitting at Mitsubishi Japan, in order to supply enthusiasts with repair parts. He has since let go of that facility.

During the 1960s and 1970s, he was also a known pimp in San Francisco, referred to several times as \\"The West Coast Godfather of the Game\\" and \\"The Pope of Pimping\\". Early life Born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States, Fillmore began learning about the blues at an early age. \\"I done lived the blues,\\" he once said in an interview. \\"The blues is about picking cotton, working in the fields, living in the streets, and you know I did all these things.\\" In 1955, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career, playing by himself in the street and later starting a band called Eddy N and The Blues Slayers. During this time he had a relationship with Etta James before she achieved her fame as a blues singer and recorded a few 45 rpm records himself. His most successful record from this time was titled \\"You Got the Nerve of a Brass Monkey\\". Pimping Fillmore's life took a dramatic turn when one night, while playing a blues bar in Midland, Texas, he noticed a young woman who kept coming in and out of the bar. As he tells it, \\"Finally, she came up to me and said, \\"I like you. I want you to have this money.\\" I asked her how she got all that money. She finally told me she was a hooker. I asked her what a hooker did, and she broke it on down for me.\\" Upon returning to California, he relocated to San Francisco, bringing the girl along with him for extra income. He continued working as a musician, playing in Fillmore District clubs like the Trees Pool Hall and the old Fillmore Theater. He even scored gigs opening for B.B. King and Dinah Washington. Eventually, however, Fillmore found the lure of pimping too strong and effectively left music behind. He built up a stable of prostitutes and had anywhere from ten to twenty two women working Fillmore Street every day. His wardrobe consisted of sharkskin suits, alligator shoes and diamond watches, and he could often be seen cruising up and down Fillmore Street in a new Cadillac. In the documentary American Pimp, Fillmore estimates that, in his entire career as a pimp, he had over 9,000+ prostitutes. Return to music Fillmore Slim became friends with Eli's owner Troyce Key, who admired Slim's musical stylings and eventually recorded his first album called Born to Sing the Blues (as Clarence \\"Guitar\\" Sims), released in 1987. In 1996 Fillmore Slim updated/re-released, Born to Sing the Blues, on the Mountain Top label. Several years of touring and playing gigs followed, which led to a record deal in 1999 with Fedora Records and an album called Other Side of the Road, released in 2000. Fillmore has released more albums/CDs in the years since with a trilogy of CDs on Mountain Top Records: The Game, The Legend of Fillmore Slim, and The Blues Playa's Ball; that tell his story in his own words and music. Fillmore Slim's song writing talents, and musicianship have garnered several awards including being inducted into the Bay Area's West Coast Blues Hall of Fame in 2008, and the Lowell Fulson \\"Jus' Blues\\" Award in Memphis in 2011. Since his musical resurgence, Fillmore has found his largest fanbase to be in Europe, where he's played the Zurich Blues Festival and the Blues Estafette in Utrecht, Holland, and France, among others.

It was found among the great collection of art treasures of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tirol in castle Ambras, Austria, together with another called Ambraser Hofjagdspiel. Illustrations The 48 cards of the deck, measuring c. 97 mm x 140 mm (3¬æ in x 5¬Ω in), are decorated with bright-colored tempera paint and bear details in silver and gold leaf. The four suits of this set depicting court functions are represented by means of four heraldic colours. Each suit sign carries the coats of arms of four kingdoms: France, Germany, Bohemia and Hungary, so that, accordingly, each card carries the title of the function depicted and the respective Roman number in relation to the suit sign it represents. The illustrations, with their names written in archaic German, depict the precedence of different court functions during the late Middle Ages, together with the values of the cards, numbered 1 - 10 in Roman numerals, except for the king and queen which have no number and are also the only two subjects that do not state the character's occupation. In all four suits the I features a fool, Narr, or its female equivalent Narryn, and the two highest cards next to the king and queen are the master of the household, Hofmeister X, who was in charge of the court during the ruler's absence, and the marshal, Marschalk IX, in charge of any duty that involved the use of horses or carriages. With the exception of two subjects, the Jungfrawe, card VI in all suits, and the Trometer, card IIII in Germany and Hungary, all other personages are individual and don‚Äôt appear in any other suit. The social rank of each one of the personages may be easily understood, according to the higher or lower value of the relevant card. For instance, the Doctor, Artzt, in Bohemia suit, would have shared more or less the same social rank as a Chaplain, Capplan, in Germany suit, or of a Chancellor, Kanzler, in Hungary suit, or of a Household Mistress of a queen or a princess, Hofmeistryn, in France suit, so all these subjects are featured on the eighth, VIII, card of different suits. Meaning The Hof√§mterspiel takes its name from the positions held by most of the characters which the cards depict, positions which appear to have been standard feature of a princely court during the Middle Ages. The standard names by which the court positions are known to us today tell us simply what their bearers' duties originally were on a country estate. The word \\"marshal\\", for instance, is derived from the original designation for the servant in charge of horses, whose duties involved him in any activities where horses played the major role - in the course of journeys and campaigns, whenever quarters had to be found for the king and his entourage. With the growing importance of cavalry in times of war, the marshal's military duties were extended and in the field he became the field marshal. But despite that, unlike other known decks of the same age belonging to German culture, such as the Hofjagdspiel (\\"court hunting deck\\"), the Flemish Hunting Deck, and the Stuttgarter Kartenspiel (\\"Stuttgart deck\\"), the important is that the Hof√§mterspiel reflects the political relationships in Central Europe in the mid-15th century and was basically inspired by the standard social structure of royal courts during the late Middle Ages. Therefore, what makes these cards so interesting is the fact that not only their intrinsic value for the early history of playing cards are shown, but also the evidence they provide for the understanding of the social hierarchy and everyday life in late medieval courts. The Hof√§mterspiel may not be the only deck of its kind. In the earliest known description of playing cards, there is a similar 60 card deck. Written by John of Rheinfelden in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1377, each of the four suits contained five court cards: king, queen, ober marshal, maid, and unter marshal.Johannes of Rheinfelden, 1377 at trionfi.com The ten numbered cards depicted various professions like baker, butcher, miller, and farmers. The so-called Mantegna Tarocchi from Italy, c.1465, also has a similar approach in ranking professions in a hierarchy or social order however it was used for educational purposes and not for a game. The Hof√§msterspiel contains a card called K√ºchenmeister, which might be the prototype of Franz Kafka's Oberk√∂chin,Esoteric Symbols: The Tarot in Yeats, Eliot, and Kafka, p. 15, June Leavitt - University Press of America 2007 or Head Cook in his novel \\"Amerika\\". Though a K√ºchenmeister is a master chef and not a head cook, their possible connection should not be disregarded.

The very fine quality of the cards, as well as the particular ranking scheme, suggest that the Hof√§mterspiel was likely used for playing a trick-taking game, in which the Narr and Narryn might have acted as jokers.Hof√§msterspiel, p. 82, Piatnik Ed. 1976 See also *Karnoffel *Ganjifa *Gnav *Tarot *Playing cards References External links * Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna * The World of Playing Cards * Hofamterspiel Tarot deck with book * Andy's Playing Cards * Ambras Court playing cards History of card decks 15th-century prints ","title":"Hof√§mterspiel"},{"id":"18850039","text":"Bƒ±ƒüƒ±r (also, Bugur and Bygyr) is a village and municipality in the Goychay Rayon of Azerbaijan.

VPPs are used by yacht designers, boat builders, model testers, sailors, sailmakers, also America's Cup teams, to predict the performance of a sailboat before it has been built or prior to major modifications.  Background  The first VPP was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the early 1970s when Commodore H. Irving Pratt funded research to predict the performance \\"of a sailing yacht, given knowledge of its hull, rig and sailplan geometry\\".  Methodology  VPPs are iterative programs which require educated guesses of initial parameters to begin operating. Generally VPPs are composed of two mechanisms, a boat model and a solution algorithm. Initial guesses of parameters including boat speed (Vs), heel angle (Œ¶), number of reefs and sail flatness are input into the boat model. Using these input parameters the solution algorithm calculates the difference between the propulsive force of the sails and the resistive force of the hull. It also calculates the righting moment created by the hull and the operational heel angle. Since the propulsive force and the resistive force are not likely to be equal on the first iteration, the solution algorithm has the responsibility of adjusting the input parameters and balancing the forces until it produces the maximum possible speed at each true wind angle. Hydrodynamic force model The resistive forces acting on a hull and its appendages (keel, rudder and other fins) can be broken down into a number of smaller components. #Viscous drag ‚Äì This type of drag is also known as \\"skin friction\\" as it is thought to derive entirely from the frictional resistance of water molecules imposing a force as they slide past the wetted surface of the hull and its appendages. This type of drag scales proportionally to wetted surface and is one of the two constitutive components of hull resistance. #Residuary resistance ‚Äì Residuary resistance includes all other remaining types of resistance on an upright, bare hull in calm water. The reason for this grouping is that of all the types of hydrodynamic resistance imposed upon a boat hull in motion, only viscous drag can be cleanly isolated, as it scales proportionally to wetted surface area. Residuary resistance, then, is composed primarily of wave-making resistance, eddy formation and large-scale separation, all of which are too complex to be determined empirically given prior knowledge of hull geometry. These types of resistance can only be determined by model testing. #Induced drag ‚Äì Induced drag is a result of an imperfect, or non-infinite, lifting surface (in this case the keel, rudder and any other appendages.) When lift is generated in three dimensions, a closed circulation loop is formed which creates downwash. This downwash alters the free stream velocity, by rotating it downward, towards the downwash. This new angle results in a small increase in resistance as it has a component in the direction of the free stream. #Heel induced drag ‚Äì When a sailing yacht heels, there are adjustments which need to be made to the base resistance of the hull due to the modified hull geometry, all of which are captured by this term. The first change is the wetted surface area of the hull, which will result in a greater viscous drag if increased. More significantly, however, are the changes in residuary resistance when heeled. The underwater portion of the hull will no longer be symmetric and will usually result in increased residuary resistance. This is particularly true if there are major changes to the beam to draft ratio or the longitudinal center of buoyancy. #Added resistance in waves (RAW) ‚Äì This element represents the computationally or experimentally derived resistance due to the motion of a yacht in a seaway. This resistance can be considered to be a factor either of true wind speed (VT) or of physical characteristics of the yacht. Aerodynamic force model #Lift from sails #Drag on sails #Induced drag Solving and optimization VPPs solve for the performance of a yacht by resolving all forces and moments acting on the yacht. Pitching and yawing moments can be assumed to be zero for simplicity. Presentation VPPs produce a great deal a data, so the presentation of this data requires special consideration. While tabular output can be valuable for identifying specific values, the most common way to present VPP output is with a polar plot.Moonbeam VPP polar chart  Uses  Sailing yacht design Sailing yacht handicapping VPPs are used by a variety of sailing organizations to assess theoretical boat performance and then assign \\"handicaps\\" to allow boats of different styles and sizes to race against one another. The IOR and IMS handicapping rules were some of the earliest adopters of VPPs. In the United States, the most common handicapping rule is the PHRF rule, developed and promoted by the United States Sailing Association. While most other rules do not take past performance into account, PHRF differentiates itself by allowing skippers to request handicap reductions after a series of poor racing results. In Europe, the most common handicapping system used today is the IRC rule.

It was believed that the steps were a control gate for those who enter and exited the Sanctuary. (\\"Sun Gate Inti\\") It is one of the most important archeological constructions around the Machu Picchu site. Inti Punku was once the main entrance to Machu Picchu, in particular it was the primary approach from the then capitol city of Cusco to the southeast. The gate likely would have been protected by Incan military. Inti Punku is dedicated to the cult of the Inti, the Sun god. Because of its location on a ridge southeast of Machu Picchu, the rising sun would pass through the Sun Gate each year on the summer solstice. It is located 2745 meters above the sea level. The altitude of the climb to Inti Punku from Machu Picchu is 290 metres. It is a wide archaeological site with windows and gates that are held up by terraces. This is the first place that tourists can see the whole sanctuary. Tourists are able to see the sun rise over the whole mountains by Machu Picchu. The location of the gate was given to watch the people passing.  Route description  The route covers a distance of approximately a mile, eventually rising above the ruins of Machu Picchu The ruins themselves serve as a final stop for hikers completing an optional five-day hike from a point far back from Aguas Calientes, the city at the base of Machu Picchu. This hike has been recommended by many tour guides as giving a great view of the city of Machu Picchu.

Jaffe (born July 6, 1933) is a clinical professor and was the drug Czar under the administration of President of the United States Richard Nixon.  Career  Many American soldiers used heroin during the Vietnam War. According to Representative Robert Steele in a report for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, there was little use in the Army until late 1969. But by 1971, 10 to 15 percent of the troops in Vietnam were using heroin from the Golden Triangle. It was about this time that based on the efforts of Jaffe, methadone clinics were established in the U.S., partly to treat addicted veterans. Under the administration of President Nixon, Jerome Jaffe was the chief of the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention (SAODAP), an executive agency created by President Nixon, a member of the Republican Party of the United States. During his career, he popularized the use of methadone treatments for heroin addicts, stating that \\"There was evidence that methadone treatment was effective. There were some good controlled studies.\\" He also initiated \\"methadone programs, detoxification programs, and therapeutic communities.\\" Jaffe was a powerful opponent of Ibogaine trials to treat drug dependency, concentrating instead on lifelong replacement therapies with alternative opiates like methadone and buprenorphine. Currently, Jaffe is a clinical professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, where he works in the Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse. He lives in Maryland and has three grandchildren.

Besides the solo trumpet in C, the concerto is scored for 2 flutes, strings, and continuo. Part of the difficulty of the concerto is because of the very high notes for the trumpet, which is written even higher than the flutes (indeed, the solo trumpet part is much higher than would be advisable for the modern trumpet, while the flute parts are too low for modern flutes to be heard clearly against a full string section). Both movements provide room for a cadenza; Edward H. Tarr's edition for Musica Rara writes out cadenzas in the trumpet part but not in the conductor's score. Tarr's cadenza for the second movement even goes up to a G above high C but provides ossia for the next lower G. Discography Niklas Eklund has recorded it with the Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble conducted by Nils-Erik Sparf on a Naxos Records album entitled The Art of the Baroque Trumpet, Vol. 4, which includes other concertos for natural trumpet (i.e., no valves, keys or slides). But generally, recordings of Michael Haydn's Trumpet Concerto typically also include Joseph Haydn's much more famous Trumpet Concerto in E-flat major.

He is said to be the son of an English pirate and a Malagasy queen regnant, Antavaratra Rahena.Sainte Marie Island The region, known as the Betsimisaraka confederation, covered of coast and this legacy was created by Ratsimilaho.Ratsimilaho, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, accessed 13 August 2008 The Betsimisaraka make up approximately fifteen percent of the Malagasy people and are the second largest group in Madagascar after the Merina. Biography Ratsimilaho was reputedly born as a result of the hospitality shown by the Malagasy queen Antavaratra Rahena to an English pirate named \\"Thomas\\" (possibly Thomas Tew, Thomas White, or Thomas Collins) when he arrived to show his accreditation as a privateer. The pirate is said to have adopted the resulting child and taken the boy briefly to England where he had some education. Now \\"according to most chroniclers\\", whilst Ratsimilaho had been away there had been a redistribution of power. The tribes to the south under their leader Ramano had captured the territory to the north of TamataveForget Colonialism? Sacrifice and the Art of Memory in Madagascar, Jennifer Cole, 2001, , accessed 13 August 2008 as they were jealous of the riches arising from the trade with the Europeans. Ratsimilaho's initial approach was to negotiate with Ramano and the Tsikoa clans, but this proved impossible. He therefore called a meeting, a kabary, of the leaders and after much debate he persuaded them to give him the power to lead them in a battle. Ratsimilaho was given the title of filoha be and he used this power to create a new state. Driving out the Southern clans and resisting their later attempts at reinvasion he was victorious. The southern tribes were then called those who wear red mud. In 1712 Ratsimilato obtained a new treaty and it was at this time that his people took on the title of Betsimisaraka meaning the many who will not be sundered, whilst his descendants were known as the Zana-Malatas, the \\"children of the mulattos\\". He is said to have requested a wife from the people known as Zafimbolamena (Grandchildren of Gold) who were part of the Sakalava people. The resulting child, a son, was named Zanahary - a name now used in Madagascar to mean a God.Recollecting from the Past, Ron Emoff, , accessed 14 August 2008 Ramaromanompo was the new name taken by Ratsimilaho meaning he who is served by many. This important Betsimisaraka federation lasted principally until 1750/51, ending either because of the death of the filoha be or because of internal squabbles. The confederation continued after his death but there was pressure from outside and disagreement within. However his legacy, the Betsimisaraka territory included the important port Toamasina, Fenerive, Maroansetra commanding Antongil Bay, the largest bay in Madagascar.Madagascar: A Country Study, Helen Chapin Metz, ed.

The barn was built in Death Canyon on the Death Canyon Trail at its junction with the Alaska Basin Trail by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935 in the National Park Service rustic style. Located with a clear view of Prospector Mountain, it shares a common style and purpose with the Cascade Canyon Barn to the north in the park, with minor differences attributable to available materials and the preferences of the work crews building the barns. History The 1¬Ω story log building was designed by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Design. Built as a barn, it became a patrol cabin in 1945. It was built by workers from CCC Hot Springs Camp #NP-3 or Jenny Lake Camp #NP-4, working out of the Phelps Lake Spike Camp. A proposed cabin to house trail maintenance tools and personnel was never completed, so the barn was converted to that purpose shortly after the CCC was dissolved. In the 1950s it briefly housed a seasonal ranger station. Design The rustic log cabin features saddle-notched log corners on a stone foundation. The foundation is buttressed at the corners to support the projecting log ends, a feature typical of Park Service designs of the era. The original wide barn door has been filled in with windows and a personnel door. The interior consists of a large main room with a small tack room in the southwest corner, now used for tool storage. The partition uses vertical poles faced with 4-1/2: wide tongue and groove planks. A loft is framed with logs and 8\\" rough-cut decking, reached by a milled-lumber stairway. The loft deck is covered with 6\\" wide flooring planks. The roof structure is open to the underside of the roof, with exposed log trusses.The hayloft was converted to a sleeping loft. The furnishings include a rodent-proof food storage bock and a propane stove. The adjoining corral enclosure is listed as a contributing feature, with standing trees supporting most of the fence enclosure. The Death Canyon Barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1998.

The term puy is Old French for \\"place of eminence\\", from Latin podium. The president of the Puy, elected annually, was titled the Prince du Puy, and he presided over the competitions, which were decided by panels of judges. The Puy was under the nominal patronage of the Virgin Mary, referred to as \\"Notre Dame du Puy d'Arras\\". Other puys under her patronage were founded at Amiens, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Caen, √âvreux, and Rouen. The Puy is less well- documented than the contemporary Confr√©rie des jongleurs et bourgeois d'Arras, and the two are sometimes conflated.Mary O'Neill (2006), Courtly Love Songs of Medieval France: Transmission and Style in the Trouv√®re Repertoire (Oxford: Oxford University Press), 133, and Christine Jacob-Hugon (1998), L'≈ìuvre jongleresque de Jean Bodel: L'art de s√©duire un public (De Boeck Universit√©), 27, distinguish them. A very different interpretation is offered by Carol Symes, A Common Stage. Theater and Public Life in Medieval Arras. (Ithaca and London, 2007), 216-227, who argues that ‚ÄúAt least up to 1328,‚Ä¶the Carit√© and the puy were one and the same, alternative names for the confraternity founded by the jongleurs of Arras and chartered by the cathedral of Notre-Dame during the twelfth century‚Äù (218). The statutes of the Puy d'Arras do not survive, only the later ones of the Puy d'Amiens from 1471 shed any light on the nature of laws of the puys. The Puy d'Arras was, unlike the Confr√©rie, neither social nor religious in conception. It was the creation of the urban patriciate, the wealthy and noble, plus some others, possibly those excluded from the Confr√©rie, who determined to maintain the courtly tradition.Jacob-Hugon, 28. The Puy was thus more conservative than the Confr√©rie. The poets Andrieu Contredit d'Arras and Jean de Renti (criticisingly) make mention of it and its contests. Jean Bretel mentions it in his works and he is recorded elsewhere as having served a term as Prince. Undoubtedly the highest personage to attend the Puy's festivals was Theobald I of Navarre. The high standing of the Puy is evidenced in the thirteenth-century poem Dit art√©sien.O'Neill, 133 and notes 3-5, contains several references to the sources for the Puy. By the nature of its activities, one of the favoured verse forms of the Puy was the jeu parti. Women could also participate in the Puy, both as contestants, audience members, and as judges. It has been suggested that the chansonnier known as trouv√®re manuscript R, which contains no musical notation and is rather unornamented, was compiled from oral performance at the Puy d'Arras.O'Neill, citing Johan Schubert, 27.

This season ran from January 19, 2002 to May 4, 2002 with 13 episodes aired, the fewest out of all the other seasons. The season was taped from August to December 2001. Many changes happened to the show before the start of this season. The entire cast of the previous season left the show. Nickelodeon replaced them with new cast members, who would bring in fresh material. The new cast included Chelsea Brummet, Jack DeSena, Lisa Foiles, Bryan Hearne, Shane Lyons, Giovonnie Samuels and Kyle Sullivan. Of the cast, Brummet, DeSena, Foiles and Sullivan would remain on the show for the entire reboot period from 2002-2005, similar to original cast member, Josh Server remaining present for the entire original period from 1994-2000. Other changes occurred before the start of the season as well. The show got rid of the long-running sketch Vital Information, which had been featured in every show since the second episode of the first season, but resumed in season 10 with Lil' JJ as host. It was replaced with a new sketch called Know Your Stars, which was featured in almost every episode of this season and onward. The show also got rid of the traditional green room, where the cast would hang out. In this season, the cast would be featured walking around the studio instead of being in one area. Another change was the absence of Kevin Kopelow, the stage manager who was usually hurt in some way. He was replaced with Pickle Boy, a random person who would usually be seen offering people pickles. In conjunction with the seventh season, All That brought in weekly special guest stars who helped open the show and participated in some of the sketches. Some included: Melissa Joan Hart, Frankie Muniz, Tony Hawk, David Arquette, Britney Spears, Aaron Carter, Will Friedle, Christina Vidal, Matthew Lillard, Ray Romano, Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara (Spy Kids), Nick Carter, Justin Timberlake, Buddy Hackett, Barry Watson, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Tom Green, and former Guiding Light star Brittany Snow. Former cast members Kenan Thompson and Amanda Bynes also guest starred and reprised some of their characters. Also, during this season there was supposed to be a scheduled performance by singer Aaliyah but due to her death the performance was made by a different musical guest. The new cast also debuted with a new intro. Unlike the first six seasons, the audience wasn't featured in a camera shot before the intro. The intro did, however, include the \\"Oh\\" sign, as in past seasons. The intro featured the cast dancing in front of a large lighted All That logo. They are all wearing white. Their names appear on the bottom of the screen and are in bright red lettering. After Sullivan is shown, the intro cuts to the cast dancing again before showing the host and the musical guest. The intro ends with the cast walking into camera shot, while all the lights go off.

Biography He was born in 1849, the son of Count Konstantin Alexander Karl Wilhelm Maximilian von Benckendorff (22 October 1816 ‚Äì Paris, 29 January 1858) and wife (Potsdam, 20 June 1848) Princess Louise Constantine Nathalie Johanne de Croy (Anholt, 2 November 1825 ‚Äì Meran, 8 January 1890), grandson of General Count Konstantin von Benckendorff and grandnephew of General Count Alexander von Benckendorff, and was educated in France and Germany before entering the diplomatic service in 1869. He began as an attach√© in Florence, and eventually served in Rome. He resigned in 1876 and lived nearly ten years on his estates, in St. Petersburg and abroad. He married Countess Sophie Shuvalova (16 October 1857 ‚Äì 28 May 1928), granddaughter of Lev Naryshkin and Olga Potocka, in 1879, and was survived by a son and a daughter. A younger son died in one of the first battles of World War I on the East Prussian front. Returning to diplomacy in 1886, he became First Secretary at the Embassy in Vienna, and from 1897 to 1903 he was the Ambassador to Denmark. The Copenhagen post gave him a vantage point for watching the principal moving powers of European politics since the matrimonial alliances of the Danish royal family occasionally brought together in a friendly family circle the widow of Alexander III, Nicholas II and the Prince of Wales who was to become King Edward VII. In this way, Count Benckendorff received his initiation into the spirit of an Anglo-Russian rapprochement even before it actually resulted in an entente. From 1903 until his death in 1917, he was the Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, the chief Russian diplomat in the United Kingdom. His major achievement was to organize the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907, which solidified relations between the two nations and helped create the Triple Entente, the alignment which would later become the Allied Powers of the First World War. He also formally proposed the agenda for the Second Hague Conference of 1907.A Pearce Higgins, \\"The Hague Peace Conferences\\", (Cambridge: Cambridge U.P., 1999), pp. 53‚Äì5.

He was the United States Attorney for the Central District of California from October 2007 to September 2009.Los Angeles Times November 11, 2010. Education and military service O'Brien graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1981, where he earned his bachelor's degree, and from the University of San Diego School of Law in 1993, where he was an associate editor of the San Diego Law Review and received his degree with honors. He accumulated 2,000 flight hours as a radar intercept officer in the F-14 fighter aircraft, and is a graduate of the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School. Later life & legal career After leaving the Navy, he landed a job as a stockbroker in October 1987. He left the business world after two years with that job. O'Brien worked as deputy district attorney for Los Angeles County, California for more than five years. Before becoming United States Attorney, O'Brien served as chief of the Criminal Division in the United States Attorney's Office. He is currently a litigation partner, where he focuses his practice on white collar defense and representing clients in federal investigations, at the Los Angeles law office of Browne George Ross LLP. O'Brien was previously a partner at the Los Angeles office of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker.  Controversies  Disbanding Of Public Corruption Unit Shortly after taking office as the United States Attorney for the Central District of California, O'Brien disbanded the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles whose target was corruption of public officials, elected officials, and other governmental regulators. O'Brien explained that the unit's 17 lawyers would be farmed out to other sections in the office. Inquiry of Cardinal Roger Mahony In 2009, O'Brien launched an inquiry of Cardinal Roger Mahony, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church's Los Angeles Archdiocese, which caused the Federal Grand Jury to take action. With the grand jury's inquiry came the possibility that Mahony would be held responsible for the many molestations that occurred by members of the clergy who the cardinal had reason to suspect were pedophiles. O'Brien was responsible for bringing the suit to light. There's a possibility that the \\"let's-move-on attitude might have gained traction were it not for U.S. Attorney Thomas P. O'Brien.\\" The grand jury probe by O'Brien's office examined whether or not Mahony would be held accountable for leaving multiple sexual predators, including two convicted child molesters, serving in the ministry \\"until 2002 when a legal settlement in a clergy sexual abuse case mandated their removal.\\" The suit was later dropped as it was filed under the honest services act, a law which is usually only applied to public officials and not members of the church.Los Angeles Times, Jan. 28 & 29, 2009, \\"Cardinal Mahony under federal fraud probe over abusive priests\\" Government expense account O'Brien resigned as United States Attorney in September 2009. Shortly thereafter, an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department Inspector General uncovered that O'Brien stayed at pricey hotels while traveling and then sought government reimbursement by telling his secretary to lie and state falsely that more affordable rooms were not available. The report found that O'Brien's claims for reimbursement were \\"inappropriate and egregious\\" ethics violations. O'Brien denied telling his secretary to make false statements, but when interviewed by investigators he then blamed his secretary. Investigators found O'Brien's claims to be neither \\"credible or persuasive,\\" the report said. O'Brien maintained his innocence. However, as of November 2010, O'Brien made right with the case and has stated that \\"he didn't do anything wrong,\\" but told the L.A. Times that he takes \\"full responsibility\\" for excessive spending caused by any errors. The former U.S. Attorney paid an amount of money to the Department of Justice to cover hotel bills the inspector general report identified as excessive.

The poem made fun of well-known poets and critics of the time and brought notoriety to its author. Overview A Fable for Critics satirized many of the most important figures in American literature at the time, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and James Fenimore Cooper.Sullivan, 214 Many of his harshest judgments were aimed at names that have not survived in posterity, including Nathaniel Parker Willis, Cornelius Mathews, Fitz-Greene Halleck, and John Neal.Heyman, 81 He gave ample praise to Charles Frederick Briggs and Lydia Maria Child, though he was friends with both and likely allowed his friendship to inflate his assessment of their talents.Duberman, 98 Of Edgar Allan Poe, he said he was \\"three-fifths genius... and two-fifths sheer fudge\\". Lowell included himself as well, referring to himself as having difficulty determining the difference \\"'twixt singing and preaching\\".Sullivan, 214‚Äì215 Many of the poetic portraits were balanced with praise, as in Halleck's: Lowell's most vicious treatment was aimed at Margaret Fuller, whom he referred to as Miranda.Heymann, 83 At first, he intended to exclude her entirely but thought doing so would be more insultingVon Mehren, Joan. Minerva and the Muse: A Life of Margaret Fuller. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1994: 294. and was convinced to write \\"a line or two\\" by his wife Maria White Lowell.Duberman, 99 Ultimately, his characterization was the only which was wholly negative and not balanced with praise. He suggested that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own and that she was only genuine in her spite.Duberman, 100 Publication history James Russell Lowell, three years before the publication of A Fable for Critics A Fable for Critics, with the subtitle \\"A Glance at a Few of Our Literary Progenies\\", was published anonymously as a pamphlet early in 1848. Three thousand copies were sold in short order.Duberman, 101 Lowell had hoped there would be sufficient profit from his sales, which he intended to turn over to his financially struggling friend Briggs, though it was said the profit was only enough to purchase one small silver plate. The poem was reprinted several times with Lowell's name after its initial publication. One version included an introductory note explaining its author's intentions: \\"This jeu d'esprit was extemporized, I may fairly say, so rapidly was it written, purely for my own amusement and with no thought of publication\\" until convinced to do so by Briggs. Critical response John Ruskin labeled the poem \\"in animal spirit and power... almost beyond anything I know\\". Oliver Wendell Holmes found it \\"capital‚Äîcrammed full and rammed down hard‚Äîwith powder (lots of it)‚Äîshot‚Äîslugs‚Äîvery little wadding... all crowded into a rusty-looking sort of blunderbuss barrel, as it were‚Äîcapped with a percussion preface‚Äîand cocked with a title page as apropos as a wink to a joke\\". Henry Wadsworth Longfellow compared it to Lord Byron's \\"English Bards\\" as being \\"full of wild wit and deviltry, and amazingly clever\\". Freeman Hunt reviewed the poem for Merchants' Magazine in December 1848 and remarked on how true the character assessments were: \\"Our friends Bryant, Halleck, Willis, Whittier, Poe, and last but not least, Harry Franco, (Briggs,) are, in our judgment, as genuine life pictures as were ever sketched with pen or pencil, in prose or verse. The severity, if any, is lost in the general fidelity of the delineations.\\"Thomas, Dwight and David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe 1809‚Äì1849. New York: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 774. Lowell's friends objected to the intense criticism of Fuller, specifically William Wetmore Story and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Edgar Allan Poe reviewed the work in the Southern Literary Messenger and called it \\"'loose'‚Äîill-conceived and feebly executed, as well in detail as in general... we confess some surprise at his putting forth so unpolished a performance\\".Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 141‚Äì142. . His final judgment was that the work was not successful: \\"no failure was ever more complete or more pitiable\\".Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 405. . Ultimately, A Fable for Critics earned Lowell notoriety as a poet, once his name was revealed, though he did not significantly profit from its publication.

It was established by an Act of Parliament to emulate the famous ancient university of Nalanda, which functioned between the 5th and 13th centuries. The idea to resurrect Nalanda University was endorsed in 2007 at the East Asia Summit, represented mostly by Asian countries including China, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam, apart from Australia and New Zealand, and as such, the university is seen as one of the flagship projects of the Government of India. It has been designated as an \\"International Institution of National Importance\\" by the Parliament, and began its first academic session on 1 September 2014. Initially set up with temporary facilities in Rajgir, a modern campus spanning over is expected to be finished by 2020. This campus, upon completion, will be the largest of its kind in India, and one of the largest in Asia. The first Chancellor of the university was Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, followed by former Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs George Yeo. Nalanda is exclusively a graduate school, currently only offering Master's courses, with PhD programmes starting in gradual phases from 2020. The proposed Nalanda International University campus, being built in Rajgir Formation and Construction Nalanda University Bill On 28 March 2006 the 11th President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam proposed the idea while addressing the Joint Session of the Bihar Vidhan Mandal for revival of Nalanda university. The Nalanda University Bill, 2010 was passed on 21 August 2010 in Rajya Sabha and 26 August 2010 in Lok Sabha. The bill received Presidential assent on 21 September 2010 thereby becoming an Act. The University came into existence on 25 November 2010, when the Act was implemented. International funding Despite the international dimension of the project being repeatedly stressed, the total amount received from the participating countries in the East Asia summit, including Australia, China, Thailand, Laos and Indonesia, is . However, out of this total, $1 million promised by the Chinese is earmarked for a Chinese style building on the campus. Surpassing the foreign government contributions, former Chancellor George Yeo‚Äôs initiative to raise funds from private Singaporeans has led to a pledge of 10 million Singaporean dollars (488.9 million) for the library building. Japan promised to finance the construction but has not paid anything. Singapore may not pay for the library, now that Yeo has resigned. Gopa Sabharwal has been appointed the first Vice-Chancellor of this university in February 2011. It has been estimated that US$500m will be required to build the new facility, with a further US$500m needed to sufficiently improve the surrounding infrastructure. The group is looking for donations from governments, private individuals and religious groups. The State Government of Bihar handed over of land acquired from local people, to the University, where construction work has begun. It is a dream project of the Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar.

Known crew include director Ben Sharpsteen and animators Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, Al Eugster, Shamus Culhane, and Errol Gray. It was the 87th Mickey Mouse short film to be released, the eighth of that year. Although the film is called Mickey's Circus, the film mostly features Donald Duck; however, Mickey Mouse does feature in the beginning and end. Also featured are a trio of trained sea lions, a young sea lion pup, and an audience full of children. Plot Mickey Mouse is hosting a circus featuring Donald Duck and a trio of sea lions. Children from all over come to see the circus. After Mickey introduces the performers, the show starts. Donald enters the ring only to be stampeded by the sea lions and a young sea lion pup. The first act is juggling, in which the sea lions and Donald juggle balls that land on their noses. When the stunt is finished, the sea lions beg to be fed, throwing their balls at Donald and pointing to their mouths. Before Donald can feed the last sea lion, the pup intervenes and steals the fish. The resulting tug-of-war ends in the sea lions fighting over the fish. The next act is playing the organ pipe, but the sea lion can't do it right. The pup interferes and plays the tune \\"Yankee Doodle\\" instead, but the crowd cheers anyway. The pup distracts Donald to the point where Donald loses his temper, tries to attack the pup, and gets stuck in a drum. The next thing Donald knew, the whole crowd starts imitating him. Donald regains control, however, by driving the sea lions away from the basket of fish with his pistol. Subsequently, the sea lions refuse to perform unless fed first. When Donald gets out a fish, the sea lion plays the tune rapidly. Again, the sea lions fight over the fish, destroying the organ pipe and ignoring Donald in the process. The pup steals the fish again and Donald chases; there follows a fast chase around the arena, which includes Donald chasing the pup through a cannon and Mickey attempting to intervene. The spectators fire the cannon, shooting Mickey and Donald out and resulting in Mickey landing on a tightrope and Donald hanging from a hook within the fish basket. When a spectator cuts Donald's basket loose, he falls, lands on a circus bike, and rides across the tightrope toward Mickey (who somehow gets out of the way). The spectators oil the rope, causing Donald's bike to run backward and splatter Mickey, go over Mickey's pole, bounce back from the start, and end up on top of Mickey's pole. When the spectators throw a barrel at Mickey, Donald's bike is bounced off but Donald gets back by driving through thin air and Mickey is loaded on as well. The climax ensues when the spectators turn up the voltage to high, electrocuting Mickey and Donald and splitting the bike (and rope) in half, causing Mickey and Donald to fall. The two land in the seal tank, only to be hit by a fish thrown by the pup, and the film ends with the sea lions beating up Mickey and Donald as they fight over the fish in the tank as the camera irises out to the end card.

History History of rugby league in Broughton Broughton Rangers were founded in 1877. They were one of the twenty-one clubs to meet at the George Hotel, Huddersfield on 29 August 1895 to form the Northern Rugby Football Union. The club went on to win the Championship once; the Challenge Cup twice; the Lancashire County Cup twice and the Lancashire League twice. They were also runners-up in the Challenge Cup on two occasions and the Lancashire Cup once. In 1933, Broughton Rangers moved out of Broughton to the Belle Vue Stadium. In 1945/46, Broughton rebranded themselves as Belle Vue Rangers. The team folded after the 1954/55 season. New Broughton Rangers New Broughton Rangers were formed with the assistance of Salford City Reds and competed in the Dolben Cup at the 2007 York International 9s. They won one game out of three and failed to make it out of their pool. Rangers joined the Rugby League Conference in 2008, finishing second in the North West division. The club played their home games at Peel Park, Salford located next to the Salford University Leisure Centre.

A sequel to Rambo III (1988), it is the fourth installment in the Rambo franchise and co-stars Julie Benz, Paul Schulze, Matthew Marsden, Graham McTavish, Rey Gallegos, Tim Kang, Jake La Botz, Maung Maung Khin, and Ken Howard. The film is dedicated to the memory of Richard Crenna, who played Colonel Sam Trautman in the previous films, and who died of heart failure in 2003. In the film, Rambo (reprised by Stallone) leads a group of mercenaries into Burma to rescue Christian missionaries, who have been kidnapped by a local infantry unit. The rights to the Rambo franchise were sold to Miramax in 1997 after Carolco Pictures went bankrupt. Miramax intended to produce a fourth film but Stallone was unmotivated to reprise the role. The rights were then sold to Nu Image and Millennium Films in 2005, who green-lit the film before the release of Rocky Balboa. Filming began in Thailand, Mexico, and the United States in January 2007, and ended in May 2007. Rambo was theatrically released on January 25, 2008 to mixed reviews, with praise and criticism aimed at the film's violence, direction, plot, characters, and political commentary. and grossed $113.2 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million. The film was followed by Rambo: Last Blood, released on September 20, 2019. Plot Amid the political protests of the Saffron Revolution in Burma, ruthless SPDC officer Major Pa Tee Tint leads Burmese junta army forces to pillage small villages in a campaign of fear. His soldiers sadistically slaughter innocents, abduct teenage boys to be drafted into his army and hold women hostage to be raped as sex slaves. Meanwhile, 20 years after the events in Afghanistan, Vietnam War veteran John Rambo is still living in Thailand, making a meager living as a snake catcher and by providing boat rides. A missionary doctor from Colorado named Michael Burnett hires Rambo to use his boat to ferry their group up the Salween River into Burma on a humanitarian mission to provide medical aid to a village inhabited by the Karen people. Rambo initially refuses, then agrees when requested by Michael's fianc√©e Sarah Miller. During the trip, the boat is stopped by pirates demanding Sarah in exchange for passage, forcing Rambo to kill them. Greatly disturbed by Rambo's actions, Michael sends him back upon arriving at their destination, claiming his group no longer wants his help. In the village, the missionaries provide aid to those attacked by Tint's soldiers. But the army strikes, the villagers are massacred and the missionaries are abducted. The pastor of the missionaries' church comes to Thailand and asks Rambo to guide a team of five mercenaries on a rescue mission. Rambo takes the mercenary team to the drop-off point and offers to help, but Lewis, a former SAS soldier and the team's leader, refuses. Myint, a Karen rebel familiar with the area, leads the mercenaries to the village of the massacre. As they survey the damage, a squad of Tint's soldiers arrive in a cargo truck with a group of villagers, intent on playing games and killing them. Outnumbered, the mercenaries take cover and watch helplessly as the soldiers prey on their hostages. Having secretly followed the mercenaries, Rambo emerges in time to kill all the soldiers with his bow and arrow, allowing the hostages to escape unharmed. Rambo joins the mercenary team and they make their way to Tint's soldiers' camp. They stealthily rescue the surviving American missionaries and Burmese hostages and flee under cover of night. The next morning, Tint and his soldiers pursue them. Rambo lures a section of the army into activating a dormant British Tallboy bomb left lying in the forest, killing his targets. Eventually, Tint's soldiers manage to capture everyone except for Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy, the mercenaries' sniper. Before Tint can execute the mercenaries, Rambo launches a surprise attack by seizing a jeep mounted with an M2 Browning machine gun, igniting a massive firefight in the jungle during which he shoots most of Tint's army dead while the mercenaries engage Tint's soldiers. The Karen rebels, led by Myint, arrive and join the fight, helping to overwhelm Tint's soldiers and kill them all. After realizing his defeat, Tint attempts to escape, but Rambo intercepts and disembowels him dead with his machete. Sometime later, Rambo returns to the United States to visit his father at his home in Bowie, Arizona. Cast * Sylvester Stallone as John J.

It was green-lit and sold before Rocky Balboa was released. In between the making of the third and fourth films in the Rambo franchise, the films' original producer, Carolco Pictures, went out of business. In 1997, Miramax purchased the Rambo franchise. The following year, Miramax subsidiary Dimension Films intended to make another film, and a writer was hired to write the script, but attempts to make it were deterred by Stallone, who had stated that he no longer wanted to make action movies. In 2005, the studio sold those rights to Millennium Films and Nu Image. Stallone had stated that part of the reason that it took so long to produce a fourth film was due to a lack of a compelling story that motivated him to return to the role. An early idea was to have Rambo travel to Mexico to rescue a kidnapped young girl. Stallone thought it was \\"good\\", however, he felt the idea lacked the \\"essence of Rambo\\", still wanting the character to be a \\"lost man wandering the world\\". Stallone got the idea to set the film in Burma from the United Nations, which he later pitched to producers. The producers found the idea compelling after visiting Karen refugee camps. Maung Maung Khin is a former Karen freedom fighter and stated that if he accepted the role of the film's villain, there was a chance some of his family would have been incarcerated in Burma, but accepted the role regardless, feeling that bringing awareness of the Saffron Revolution was important. Pre-production A different director was originally attached to direct the film but left due to creative disagreements. Stallone was reluctant to direct the film due to not being prepared nor having a vision for the film but later became excited when he came up with the idea of \\"what if the film was directed by Rambo? What if the film had his personality?\\" Graham McTavish later echoed this idea, stating, \\"In many ways, Rambo directed the movie.\\" Paul Schulze stated that there were rewrites by Stallone nearly every morning. The film had a production crew of 560 people, including 450 Thai crew members, and over 80 foreign members from Australia, America, Canada, Myanmar and the United Kingdom. Filming Stallone stated that due to the small production budget the only way to make the film memorable was to make it graphically violent. He said \\"we were all sitting around in looking at the small production budget. Then I said 'Hey, fake blood is cheap, lets make it all-out bloody.'\\" Filming started on January 22, 2007 and ended on May 4, 2007. It was shot in Chiang Mai, Thailand as well as in Mexico and the United States in Arizona and California. While filming near Burma, Stallone and the rest of the crew narrowly avoided being shot by the Burmese military. Stallone described Burma as a \\"hellhole\\". He said, \\"We had shots fired above our heads\\" and that he \\"witnessed survivors with legs cut off and all kinds of land-mine injuries, maggot-infested wounds and ears cut off.\\" Post-production John Rambo was the original working title for the film but was changed in the US because Stallone thought that audiences might think that this is the final film in the Rambo series (due to the then recently released Rocky Balboa), which was not his original intent. In many other countries, the title John Rambo is used because the first Rambo film was known as Rambo in those countries. The film premiered on US television as Rambo, but the title sequence referred to it as John Rambo. On October 12, 2007, Lionsgate announced that the film title was being changed to Rambo: To Hell and Back. After some negative feedback from the online community, Stallone spoke with Harry Knowles and said: > Lionsgate jumped the gun on this. I just was thinking that the title John > Rambo was derivative of Rocky Balboa and might give people the idea that > this is the last Rambo film, and I don't necessarily feel that it will be. > He's definitely a superb athlete, there's no reason he can't continue onto > another adventure. Like John Wayne with The Searchers. Music Brian Tyler composed the original score for the film. Stallone wanted Tyler to incorporate Jerry Goldsmith's original themes into the film. He did not rely on Goldsmith's actual theme, though he based his own theme and orchestrations on the style of the original to maintain the musical series. The soundtrack comprises 20 tracks.\\"Rambo by Brian Tyler \\"www.tracksounds.com\\", 2014-03-02 Release Home media The DVD and Blu-ray Disc were released in the United States on May 27, 2008. The DVD was released in a single disc edition and 2-disc edition. The 2-disc DVD has a 2.40 anamorphic widescreen presentation with a Dolby Digital 5.1 EX track.

Reception Box office Rambo opened in 2,751 North American theaters on January 25, 2008 and grossed $6,490,000 on its opening day, and $18,200,000 over its opening weekend. It was the second highest- grossing movie for the weekend in the U.S. and Canada behind Meet the Spartans. The film has a box office gross of $113,344,290, of which $42,754,105 was from Canada and the United States. Europe's biggest cinema chain (and the third biggest in the world), Odeon, refused to show the film on any of its screens in the United Kingdom, due to a dispute with its British distributor Sony Pictures over rental terms for the film. The film was shown in Ireland and the United Kingdom by other theater chains such as Empire Cinemas, Vue, Cineworld and Ward Anderson. The film was not shown in the French-speaking part of Switzerland due to legal and commercial problems with the distributor, even if it was available on screens of France and the Swiss German-speaking part. Critical response Rambo received mixed reviews, with critics praising the film's action sequences and Stallone's performance, but criticizing the film's excessive violence. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 38% based on 152 reviews, with an average rating of 5.00/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Sylvester Stallone knows how to stage action sequences, but the movie's uneven pacing and excessive violence (even for the franchise) is more nauseating than entertaining.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote, \\"Mr. Stallone is smart enough‚Äîor maybe dumb enough, though I tend to think not‚Äîto present the mythic dimensions of the character without apology or irony. His face looks like a misshapen chunk of granite, and his acting is only slightly more expressive, but the man gets the job done. Welcome back.\\" Michael H. Price of Fort Worth Business Press wrote, \\"Stallone invests the role with a realistic acceptance of the aging process, and with traces reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart in 1951's The African Queen and Clint Eastwood in 1992's Unforgiven ‚Äî to say nothing of the influences that the original First Blood had absorbed from Marlon Brando in 1953's The Wild One and Tom Laughlin in 1971's Billy Jack.\\" When asked what his take on the film was, First Blood writer David Morrell said: > I'm happy to report that overall I'm pleased. The level of violence might > not be for everyone, but it has a serious intent. This is the first time > that the tone of my novel First Blood has been used in any of the movies. > It's spot-on in terms of how I imagined the character ‚Äî angry, burned-out, > and filled with self-disgust because Rambo hates what he is and yet knows > it's the only thing he does well. ... I think some elements could have been > done better, [but] I think this film deserves a solid three stars. Reception in Burma The film is banned by the Burmese government. Upon release, the then-ruling military junta ordered DVD vendors in Burma not to distribute the film due to the movie's content. Despite having never been released there theatrically or on DVD, bootleg versions of Rambo are available. The opposition youth group Generation Wave copied and distributed the film as anti-Tatmadaw propaganda. The Karen National Liberation Army has said that the movie gave them a great boost of morale. Some rebels in Burma have even adopted dialogue from the movie (most notably \\"Live for nothing, or die for something\\") as rallying points and battle cries. \\"That, to me,\\" said Sylvester Stallone, \\"is one of the proudest moments I've ever had in film.\\" Also, overseas Burmese have praised the movie for its vivid portrayal of the military's oppression of the Karen people. Sequel In 2009, Stallone announced plans for a fifth film titled Rambo V: The Savage Hunt. The film would have been loosely based on Hunter by James Byron Huggins and would have focused on Rambo leading an elite special forces kill team to hunt and kill a genetically engineered creature. In 2011, Sean Hood was hired to write a new script, separate from The Savage Hunt, titled Rambo: Last Stand that Hood described was \\"more in line with the small-town thriller of First Blood\\". In 2012, Hood revealed that Rambo V was on hold while Stallone finishes The Expendables 2. Hood also revealed his uncertainty whether the film will be similar to Unforgiven or will be a passing-of-the-torch. In 2016, Sylvester Stallone revealed that Rambo V was no longer in production. In May 2018, Rambo V was re-announced and was scheduled to begin filming in September with the plot focusing on Rambo taking on the Mexican drug cartel. Stallone confirmed to be co-writing the script with Matt Cirulnick, but is unlikely to direct. That same month, Stallone confirmed that the film is scheduled for a fall 2019 release. In August 2018, Adrian Grunberg was announced as the director. Principal photography began in October 2018. Rambo: Last Blood was theatrically released in the United States on September 20, 2019.

He was born in 1856, the second child and eldest son of George Baillie-Hamilton-Arden, 11th Earl of Haddington and Helen Katherine, daughter of Sir John Warrender, 5th baronet of Lochend by Frances Arden. After an education at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, he was commissioned in the Royal Horse Guards on 11 September 1880. Baillie-Hamilton served with distinction in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War and the Nile Expedition of 1884. In 1889 he was appointed aide-de-camp to the Viceroy of India during the Black Mountain Expedition, being mentioned in despatches. From 1899 to 1903 he was commanding officer of the Royal Horse Guards. As such he was involved in the military arrangements for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in August 1902, and three days after the ceremony he was appointed a Member (4th class) of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) on 12 August 1902, during a private audience with King Edward VII. He retired from the army in 1907, but remained in the Territorial Force as commanding officer of the Lothians and Border Horse, and served as His Majesty's Lieutenant of the County of Berwick from 1901 until he died. He was appointed a temporary Brigadier-General in December 1915, on receiving command of 41st Brigade in 14th (Light) Division. He remained in command until April 1916, returning to Britain to take charge of the 11th Mounted Brigade. Fenton House, in London In 1892 he had married Katharine Salting, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. He died, aged sixty, five months before his father so did not inherit the title and possible election in the House of Lords (as a Scottish Representative Peer) as the Earl of Haddington; instead, it passed to his eldest son, George Baillie-Hamilton. His widow, Lady Binning, donated Fenton House in Hampstead, London to the National Trust on her death in 1952.

It is found in North America and Central America and Cuba, and the northern and western regions of South America such as Chile. It grows in rocky habitats such as cliffs, scree slopes, walls and mine waste, the type of rock used as a substrate depending on the subspecies. It grows from sea-level up to 3000 metres in North America while in the British Isles it reaches 870 metres. Cultivation Asplenium trichomanes is valued in cultivation for its hardiness (down to ), its evergreen foliage and its ability to colonise crevices in stone walls. It prefers a fully or partially shaded aspect. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Subspecies Asplenium trichomanes has diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid cytotypes, which it has been argued should be recognised as distinct species. A triploid cytotype (a sterile hybrid between the diploid and tetraploid cytotype) is also known. Within these cytotypes several subspecies are recognised, including *Asplenium trichomanes subsp. trichomanes prefers acidic rocks such as sandstone, basalt and granite. In Europe and North America it is most often found in mountainous areas and is commonest in the north. It is a delicate plant with a slender stipe and rachis and relatively few pinnae. Diploid. *Asplenium trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens prefers calcareous rocks such as limestone and dolomite and often grows on the mortar in walls. It is commoner than A. t. subsp. trichomanes in much of Europe but is less widespread in North America, although it is present in southern North America where ssp. trichomanes is absent. Compared to the nominate subspecies it is stouter and has more pinnae which are more square in shape and have less of a stalk. The fronds tend to grow close to the rock while those of A. t. subsp. trichomanes tend to arch away. Tetraploid. *Asplenium trichomanes subsp. pachyrachis (syn. Asplenium csikii) is mainly found on limestone rocks and walls. It is small and delicate, grows close to the rock and has a rigid, fragile stipe and rachis.

Covering around , the gardens are located to the south of the city's historic Kasbah and its Dar al-Makhzen (Royal Palace). The name Agdal derives from the Berber language for \\"walled meadow\\". Extending for some , the gardens include groves of orange, lemon, fig, apricot and pomegranate trees in rectangular plots, linked by olive-lined walkways. Together with the medina of Marrakech and the Menara Gardens, the Agdal Gardens were listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1985. History The gardens were established in the 12th century by Abd al- Mu'min of the Almohad Caliphate. They served as an orchard. They were renovated by the Saadi dynasty and then enlarged during the reign of Moulay Abderrahmane in the 19th century, when they were enclosed with pis√© walls. Irrigation System The gardens are irrigated using a number of pools and ditches. A network of underground channels and ditches, known as khettera, bring water down from the High Atlas mountains many kilometres away, via Aghmat in the Ourika Valley to the south. The Dar El Hana, a small pavilion or minzah, stands beside the largest pool, the Sahraj el-Hana (Tank of Health), which was used to train troops to swim.

It combines two disparate literary forms: a self-congratulatory travel brochure published by an unnamed city's Chamber of Commerce, and a news report about the murderous killing spree of a so-called \\"viaduct killer.\\" Plot summary An omniscient narrator moves through a seemingly idyllic Midwestern town relating the often dark and violent histories of various sociological groups which populate the metropolis. He speaks as both a representative of the city, definitively summing up its residents' collective views on life, and as a biased observer, subtly commenting on those views. In an indictment on small-town life, he points out the city's arrogant insularity and refusal to acknowledge the darker elements of its past. While so doing, he also describes the details of the \\"viaduct killer's\\" murders and the resulting citywide interest. In examining the subcultures of the city folk, the identity of the killer is hinted at repeatedly. The most affluent residents are decadent, secretive, and afflicted by inbreeding both literal and figurative. The Eastern European communities are known for engaging in ritualistic acts of domestic violence, self-mutilation, and murder. Feral children, organized into warring tribes after abandonment by social services, live in ramshackle treehouse-like structures constructed from garbage and prey on tourists. Meanwhile, the city has purposefully remained ignorant of those who dwell in the ghetto. The evidence brought forth about each group could point to any one as the breeding ground for the much sought-after \\"viaduct killer,\\" but the culprit's cultural identity remains unresolved. The story ends with a description of \\"the Broken Span,\\" an unfinished bridge which is the most iconic symbol of the city. Reception The New York Times book critic Walter Kendrick described the piece as Houses Without Doors' \\"most chilling story\\" and \\"its most blatantly artistic one\\" while fellow The New York Times critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt found it \\"a shade too vague and portentous to absorb the reader completely.\\" References to other works The description of the Irish children's encounter with a winged elderly man who speaks in a different language is a reference to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's short story \\"A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings\\".

Its chronological position was assigned by Eusebius Mandyczewski in 1907.Published in Joseph Haydns Werke: erste kritische durchgesehene Gesamtausgabe Although later adopted by Hoboken, Robbins Landon has subsequently revised the work's likely chronological position HC Robbins Landon, _Haydn: Chronicle and Works_ , 5 vols, (Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 1976-) v. 1, _Haydn: the Early Years, 1732-1765_ , 280-294. and now believes that the symphony is one of Haydn's earliest, written at roughly the same time as symphonies nos. 15‚Äì18. Haydn himself may have labeled the symphony his 16th, although this remains unclear. Nickname (Hermannst√§dter) In 1946, a copy of the symphony was discovered in the summer palace of Baron Samuel von Brukenthal near the city of Hermannstadt (now Sibiu in Romania). Originally thought to be an original discovery, the symphony briefly acquired the nickname Hermannst√§dter after it was recorded under that title by the Prague Symphony Orchestra with the Rumanian conductor Constantin Silvestri.. Other related nicknames associated with this find are \\"Brukenthal\\" and \\"Symphony of Sibiu\\". Because of the political climate in Eastern Europe following the Second World War, it was some time before musicologists were able to examine the find and realize that the manuscript was a copy of a work that had already been published by Breitkopf & Hartel in 1907. Movements Manuscript evidence suggests this work was originally scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, strings and continuo. Horns were subsequently added to the score, probably by Haydn himself.H. C. Robbins Landon, The Symphonies of Joseph Haydn. London: Universal Edition & Rockliff (1955): 658. \\"2 ob., 2 cor., str. [ fag., cemb. ]. The horns are missing in a number of sources; nevertheless, they are probably authentic.\\" The work is in three movements: #Allegro molto, #Andante, C major (Siciliano) #Presto, Despite the small forces at Haydn's disposal, the symphonic expression is broad and vigorous. The main theme of the opening movement hints at the Mannheim Rocket, although in abbreviated fashion. The second hybrid subject employs a developmental device quite common in Haydn's early works. It starts in the dominant major but concludes in the dominant minor, setting up a bright contrast with the closing refrain of the exposition.Ethan Haimo, _Haydn's symphonic forms: essays in compositional logic_ (Oxford University Press, 1995), 14 The second movement is a lilting siciliano played on muted strings and without winds or horns. Robbins Landon describes the movement \\"as Italian an andante as was ever composed in Naples or Palermo\\". The symphony concludes with a bright, upbeat and brief finale that, like many of his other early works, is developmentally straightforward.

She is most well known for her posthumously published book of religious poetry, Oeuvres chr√©tiennes (\\"Christian Works\\"), and her marriage into the prominent political family of Toulousain president Jean de Mansencal in 1570.  Life  Jean de Mansencal, Gabrielle de Coignard's father-in-law Though her exact date of birth is unknown, her death at the age of 36 in November 1586 provides 1550 as the likely year of her birth.Coignard and Gregg, 4. Her father, Jean de Coignard, was a prominent member of the elite literary society of Toulouse during the mid-16th century, acting as ma√Ætre for the prestigious Acad√©mie des Jeux Floraux. Larsen and Winn, 171. Records of his life indicate that Coignard received a good education fitting of her status‚Äîa luxury not afforded to women of lower classesBankier and Lashgari, 163.‚Äîand she was well-versed in the Catholic faith.Coignard and Gregg, 4. Although her father's position as ma√Ætre √®s Jeux Floraux and counselor at the Parlement of ToulouseCoignard and Gregg, 4. offered the Coignard family a comfortable lifestyle, Gabrielle de Coignard's marriage to Pierre de Mansencal in 1570 considerably elevated her social status.Larsen and Winn, 171. Mansencal's father was a prominent political figure in 16th-century France, acting as the first president of the Parlement of Toulouse from 1535-1555,Coignard and Gregg, 4. a position which Pierre de Mansencal would assume in 1572.Coignard and Gregg, 4.Shapiro, 231. Coignard and Mansencal had two daughters, Jeanne and Catherine,Larsen and Winn, 171. and Coignard was left a widow and single mother after just three years of marriage when her husband died of unknown causes in 1573.Coignard and Gregg, 5. There is very little information regarding the nature of Coignard's relationship with her husband, but her poems indicate that her marriage was loving and rewarding. This was a rare coincidence in a time when aristocratic marriages were generally motivated by economics and politics, but Coignard was said to have been deeply affected by Mansencal's sudden death, and current scholarship indicates that she turned to writing to cope with her grief.Larsen and Winn, 171. Unlike most women in the early modern period, Coignard never remarried after the loss of her husband;Coignard and Gregg, 8. instead, she became more deeply immersed in her Catholic faith and vowed that God would be her only spouse.Ferguson, 198. Although both widowhood and religion were two major avenues through which women gained power in this time period, there is little evidence to indicate that Coignard led anything other than a rather solitary lifestyle, and after her husband's death she essentially fell into obscurity.Coignard and Gregg, 5 We do know, however, that she passed on her religious devotion to her two daughters, and she leveraged her elite status to provide them with the educational resources that were often withheld from women in that era.Coignard and Gregg, 5. It appears that the gender expectations of early modern France greatly dictated Coignard's life, and her strict adherence to the feminine virtues of silence, piety, and humility encouraged her to refuse to publish her works during her lifetime, going so far as to hide her poetry from her daughters to ensure that this wish was fulfilled.Sommers, 273. In 1594, eight years after Coignard's death, Jeanne and Catherine de Mansencal published their mother's entire catalog of religious poetry under the title Oeuvres chr√©tiennes, which would gain substantial recognition in the early 17th century as a poetical devotional text.  Oeuvres Chr√©tiennes  Coignard - ≈íuvres chrestiennes, 1900 Les oeuvres chr√©tiennes is a compilation of 129 individual sonnets (Les sonnets spirituels, or \\"Spiritual Sonnets\\") and 21 other poems (Les vers chr√©tiens, or \\"Christian Verses\\") that employ a variety of Christian themes and biblical imageries.Coignard and Gregg, 5. Although Oeuvres focuses on some secular themes, it is first and foremost a religious text, and its preface makes that abundantly clear. This introduction, written by Coignard's daughters, dedicates her work to two ‚Äúdevout‚Äù and ‚Äúvenerable‚Äù ladies that their mother greatly admired.Coignard and Gregg, 35. These two women are generally assumed to be Marguerite de Valois and Cl√©mence Isaure, two renowned devotional poets in their own right, who greatly influenced Coignard's faith and literary career.Coignard and Gregg, 6. The preface also asks that the readers ignore the ‚Äúfairly remarkable errors in this book that you will be likely to criticize and condemn,‚Äù instead encouraging them to recognize its ‚Äúhonest and virtuous‚Äù author, indicating that the Mansencals were invested in protecting their mother's legacy.Coignard and Gregg, 37. And indeed, Coignard's work has received some literary criticism for its lack of skill,Coignard and Gregg, 13. but her work has gained praise for its emotional veracity and piety.Coignard and Gregg, 13. Religious themes are a constant throughout this work, with the Cross, grace, prayer, and death all figuring heavily into Coignard's poetry.Coignard and Gregg, 7-8. However, she has also received praise for her inclusion of the more worldly themes of widowhood, the body, and illness, for offering a unique perspective on womanhood in early modern France.Coignard and Gregg, 3, 8, 11. Coignard has also gained recognition for the transgressive nature of some of her works, notably her 1548-line long epic Imitation de la victoire de Judich (\\"Imitation of the Victory of Judith\\") from Les vers chr√©tiens. In this piece, she purposefully downplayed the more subversive acts of the biblical heroine Judith, instead highlighting her acceptable womanly values of chastity, piety, and virtue in order to cast a more favorable light on this heroine, who was often maligned by Coignard's contemporaries.Larsen and Winn, 172.Sommers, 211 and 215. Modern scholarship on Coignard suggests that, although she was forced to work within the patriarchal confines of her society‚Äîand thus frame her poetry in a manner which upheld the dominant prescriptions for femininity of that time‚ÄîCoignard nonetheless found ways to subvert sexist biblical narratives by reframing the stories of biblical heroines to focus on their virtues and accomplishments, rather than those of the male heroes within their tales.Sommers, 217.  Style  Although the act of writing itself was rather subversive for women in 16th-century France, religion was perhaps the most socially accepted creative outlet available to women during this time, allowing Coignard to take advantage of this culturally sanctioned means of self-expression.Llewellyn, 77. It was not uncommon for literate women to write or translate devotional texts in this period, though their works were rigidly structured by the dominant cultural expectations for women to be pious, chaste, silent, and humble.Llewellyn, 77. Due to her upbringing in an educated, literary household, Coignard was well acquainted with the popular literary authors and modes of the early modern period, and her work shows the influence of writers such as Luis de Granada, Guillaume du Bartas, and Pierre de Ronsard.Larsen and Winn, 171 and 172. There is some modern debate as to the extent of the popular Petrarchist influence on Coignard's work, for she was well entrenched in the literary mores of the timeLarsen and Winn, 172. and often employed the romantic descriptors characteristic of that style, but her poetry resoundingly rejected the sinful Petrarchan focus on bodily pleasure, instead focusing on the eternal divine pleasures of the soul.Llewellyn, 81. Gabrielle de Coignard, along with other women authors like Anne de Marquets and Marguerite de Navarre, was at the forefront of a religious literary movement that scholar Gary Ferguson has termed ‚Äúthe feminization of devotion,‚Äù which had profound impacts on creative spiritual texts throughout the early 17th century.Ferguson, 187. This writing style, which would later be celebrated and popularized by male authors like St. Francis de Sales, was characterized by sweetness, softness, and emotional phrasing, all of which are quite present throughout Coignard's works.Ferguson, 189. Her style is also unique for her constant reassertion of the female subject: her use of ‚Äúje‚Äù (‚ÄúI‚Äù) throughout her sonnets and vers positions herself (and women in general) as the actor within her works, offering the wife, the widow, the mother as the central character and agent in her poetry.Ferguson, 195. This female-subjecthood is especially notable in light of the overwhelming male-domination of the early modern French literary culture in which Coignard lived and wrote, and modern scholars have argued that it represents a subversion of idealized womanhood,Llewellyn, 82. as well as a social shift toward this feminization of devotion.Ferguson, 195.  Modern Interest  Although Coignard essentially fell into obscurity after the mid-17th century, interest in her work and scholarship on her life has greatly increased since the publishing of Colette Winn's detailed annotated version of Oeuvres chr√©tiennes in 1995. Feminist analysis, in particular, has become a consistent feature of most research on Coignard, and this renewed interest in her life has been attributed, at least in part, to modern attempts to include women authors in literary canon.Bankier and Lashgari, 6. Her role as a pioneer of the more feminized devotional movement in early modern French literature has been well document by Ferguson and other scholars, and the gender discourse present in her works has recently piqued the interest of feminist researchers and historical poets.Larsen and Winn, xxi and 174.Ferguson, 187.Llewellyn, 82. Her work is now being recognized as an important text in French women's history and it is gaining recognition as a rare semi- autobiographical look into the daily life of a French wife, widow, and mother in the early modern period.

CNMOC's claimancy is globally distributed, with assets located on larger ships (aircraft carriers, amphibious ships, and command and control ships), shore facilities at fleet concentration areas, and larger production centers in the U.S. CNMOC is focused on providing critical environmental knowledge to the warfighting disciplines of Anti-Submarine Warfare; Naval Special Warfare; Mine Warfare; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; and Fleet Operations (Strike and Expeditionary), as well as to the support areas of Maritime Operations, Aviation Operations, Navigation, Precise Time, and Astrometry. Oceanographer of the Navy seal. The Oceanographer of the Navy works closely with the staff of CNMOC to ensure the proper resources are available to meet its mission, to act as a liaison between CNMOC and the Chief of Naval Operations, and to represent the Naval Oceanography Program in inter-agency and international forums. Mission Responsible for command and management of the Naval Oceanography Program, utilizing meteorology and oceanography, GI&S;, and precise time and astrometry, to leverage the environment to enable successful strategic, tactical and operational battle space utilization across the continuum of campaigning and at all levels of war ‚Äì strategic, operational and tactical. History The Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command traces its ancestry to the Depot of Charts and Instruments, a 19th-century repository for nautical charts and navigational equipment. In the 1840s, its superintendent, Lieutenant Matthew Fontaine Maury, created and published a revolutionary series of ocean current and wind charts. This information, still resident in modern computer models of the ocean basins and atmosphere, laid the foundation for the sciences of oceanography and meteorology. Atmospheric science was further developed with the birth of naval aviation early in the twentieth century. During World War I and the following decades, naval aerological specialists applied the fledgling concepts of air masses and fronts to warfare, and provided forecasts to the first transatlantic flight. The Navy's weather and ocean programs contributed greatly to Allied victory in World War II. In the Pacific, Navy forecasters cracked the Japanese weather code. Hydrographic survey ships, often under enemy fire, collected data along foreign coastlines for the creation of critical navigation charts. In the mid-1970s, the Navy's meteorology and oceanography programs were integrated in a single organization reflecting nature's close interaction of sea and air. This structure is today the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command. Organization Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command is a third echelon operational command reporting to Fleet Forces Command. The Command's personnel are located at its headquarters at the John C. Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and at several field activities located around the world. Effective October 1, 2014, the Command's major subordinate activities fourth echelon commands include the Naval Oceanographic Office, located at Stennis Space Center Mississippi; Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, located in Monterey, California; the Naval Observatory, located in Washington, D.C.; the Naval Oceanography Operations Command, located at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi; the Atlantic Fleet Weather Center, located in Norfolk, Virginia; The Pacific Fleet Weather Center, located in San Diego, California; and the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Professional Development Center located in Gulfport, Mississippi were all administratively realigned to Naval Information Dominance Forces, Suffolk, Va. Operational control of Navy Oceanography forces remains aligned to Naval Meteorology and Oceangraphy Command. Furthermore, effective October 1, 2014, the Command realigned its fifth echelon commands include The Naval Ice Center, located in Suitland, Maryland and aligned underneath the Atlantic Fleet Weather Center; The Joint Typhoon Warning Center, located in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and aligned underneath The Pacific Fleet Weather Center; The Fleet Survey Team, located in Stennis Space Center, Mississippi and aligned underneath the Naval Oceanographic Office; and Naval Oceanography Anti-Submarine Warfare Center - Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, Naval Oceanography Anti-Submarine Warfare Center - Yokosuka, Japan, Naval Oceanography Mine Warfare Center - Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, and Naval Oceanography Special Warfare Center - San Diego, California who all align underneath The Naval Oceanography Operations Command. The Command provides meteorological and oceanographic services to five of the Navy's warfighting disciplines: *Anti-Submarine Warfare; *Special Warfare; *Mine Warfare; *Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; *and Fleet Operations (Strike and Expeditionary) It also supports Navigation, Precise Time and Astrometry, Maritime Operations and Aviation Operations.

Moss was born at Lincoln. He was educated at Lincoln Grammar School and Shrewsbury before entering St. John's College, Cambridge, where he held a scholarship, in 1860. In 1862, two years after his arrival, he was elected the Craven University scholar, and in 1864 he gained his BA as Senior Classic and was appointed a Fellow and Lecturer of St. John's. He was ordained a Church of England priest in 1866 and graduated M.A. in 1867. In 1866, Benjamin Hall Kennedy resigned the headmastership of Shrewsbury School, and at the age of 25, Moss was chosen to succeed him; he remained in the post for forty-two years, until he retired in 1908. Whilst headmaster, he supervised the movement of the school from its town centre site to a new location, at Kingsland, on the outskirts of the town in 1882. Among many improvements he made in the life of the school at its new location was to present the school with a swimming bath as a personal gift and to purchase additional land to expand the playing fields, re-establish speech days and the school's cadet rifle corps, and make better provision for teaching mathematics, modern languages and natural sciences. He also introduced 'Merit Halves' - a half-day holiday as reward for academic achievement, punctuality in attending school chapel, and a minimal number of punishments. In 1886, he married Frances Emma Mary Beaufort. They had two sons and four daughters. He was Chairman of the Headmasters' Conference from 1899 to 1902. Moss lived at Highfield Park in Headington near Oxford towards the end of his life, and was also a prebendary of Hereford Cathedral from 1887 until his death in London in 1917, aged 75. He was buried in Shrewsbury at the General Cemetery in Longden Road; ironically, while in process of choosing a new site for the move of Shrewsbury School, he had rejected an adjacent field after seeing at least six funerals arrive.

From the introduction of claret to Britain in 1663 specific vessels soon began to be designed to contain the wine and let it \\"breathe\\" before consumption.https://www.economist.com/node/15108718 Early examples of claret jugs are usually in green glass (as were the wine bottles themselves) with a pewter lid, usually raised by a simple finger pad. From around 1740 to 1820 the fashion was to serve claret in either a fully glass or a solid silver jug, with the contents being fully hidden.Miller's Antique Encyclopedia From about 1830 to 1920 the jugs became made of clear lead crystal glass capped with a lifting silver cover and usually also a silver handle. These are now very collectable. Most took advantage of the ease with which lead crystal can be cut. Less ornate versions were simply frosted. The silver mounted tops incorporated hinged lids, and handles that extended down halfway or to the base. The mounts were often engraved or chased, and the glass bodies were found in many different shapes and varying ornamentation. Some earlier examples were made entirely of silver. The level of craftsmanship and their aesthetic qualities determine their value. Unusual jugs, such as made by Charles Edwards or Christopher Dresser, or examples with fine engraved scenes may command high prices. The popularity of wine fell after the First World War and did not recover until the 1970s. The re-emergence of wine had a product that was less reliant upon decanting (part of the purpose of the jug) and the fashion was then generally to serve wine straight from the bottle. The purpose of the claret jug is therefore largely gone.

The reservoir is one of the reservoirs constructed as part of the Taff Fawr scheme for supplying water to Cardiff and was completed in 1886. It forms part of the Nant Fawr Corridor from the top of Roath Park to the countryside beyond Cyncoed. The reservoir was used for water supply until the mid-1970s when it became redundant. It was then used for leisure activities and for 'topping up' the adjacent Lisvane Reservoir until it was drained completely. After buying Hyder plc, its new owner Western Power Distribution (WPD), proposed to redevelop the reservoir site, but after a series of objections from national governing bodies, the County Council, local residents and both local and national politicians this was blocked. On 30 August 2013 WPD sold both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs to CELSA Group. In January 2016, Welsh Water acquired both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs from CELSA Group on a 999-year lease, which allows Welsh Water to use both reservoirs for water supply and recreational purposes while also allowing CELSA UK to continue to take its water supply from the Lisvane reservoir. History Many original features are still intact. In 1881, Cardiff Corporation commissioned their Borough Engineer, John Avery Brandon Williams, to report on water resources within a reasonable distance of Cardiff. He presented his findings in May and August 1881, and concluded that reservoirs on the upper Taff Fawr, on the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons would be the best solution. He also recommended that the Llanishen Reservoir, which had been authorised in 1878 by an Act of Parliament obtained by the Cardiff Waterworks Company prior to the Corporation buying them out, should be constructed urgently. He also suggested that its capacity could be increased from to without exceeding the limits of deviation specified in the Act. The Corporation were unsure how to proceed and sought the advice of the water engineer, John Frederick Bateman who agreed with Williams that the Taff Fawr scheme was the most promising solution which would fulfil the town's requirements at the least cost. They decided to build Llanishen Reservoir first, so that surplus water from the Lisvane catchment would not be lost, while the larger Taff Fawr project was under construction. The contract for the initial work was awarded to John Mackay in 1882 and completed in 1884, but it is unclear exactly what this involved, as soon afterwards, another contract for further work was awarded to Hill Brothers. They were unable to complete the work, due to financial difficulties arising from a sewerage contract at High Wycombe, and so T A Walker took over, completing the construction in 1886. Walker used a standard gauge railway to assist in the work, for three locomotives, an 0-6-0 saddle tank named Romilly and two 0-4-0 saddle tanks named Rhymney and Douglas are known to have worked on the site. All were manufactured by Hunslet Engine Company, and moved to the Manchester Ship Canal project afterwards. The reservoir was build on flat land, surrounded on all sides by an earth-filled embankment with a clay core. There is no connection to local streams, such as the Nant Fawr, which runs around the edge of the reservoir, so it was initially filled by rainwater. However, of pipework, some and some in diameter, was installed to connect it to the reservoirs being built on the upper Taff Fawr, and once they were operational, Llanishen was fed with water from that source. It could then supply Cardiff with up to of potable water per day. The embankment is some high and about long. The external embankment face is grassed whilst the internal face has stone pitching over the upper part and concrete over the lower part. It has a maximum surface area of water of and a capacity of . The reservoir is underlain by the St Maughan's Formation of the Lower Devonian age. Glacial till deposits of the Devonian age form part of the northern shore of the reservoir. The reservoir may be on the northern limb of the Cowbridge anticline. In common with all the assets of Cardiff Corporation Waterworks, the reservoir was transferred to Welsh Water in 1973 when the Welsh Water Authority was formed, and it supplied water until the mid-1970s. In 1996 Welsh Water's holding company was renamed as Hyder plc and the group acquired South Wales Electricity plc. After Hyder's share price collapsed in 1999 and 2000, the Hyder Group was sold to WPD on terms recommended by the Hyder Board after a competitive and hostile takeover battle. WPD is the American-owned electricity distribution network operator for South West England and South and West Wales. Welsh Assembly members were concerned that the takeover would mean jobs being transferred to Bristol and Cheshire, and at its effect \\"on consumers' interests, on the environment, and on the wider economy\\". WPD acquired the reservoir from Welsh Water in 2001 when Welsh Water was acquired by the not-for-profit organisation Glas Cymru: the reservoir was sold to a WPD subsidiary, Hyder Industrial Group Ltd, which was later renamed Western Power Distribution Investments Ltd. The reservoir, which forms part of the Nant Fawr corridor, has been redundant since the 1970s and has only been used for leisure purposes and for 'topping up' the adjacent Lisvane Reservoir. Protection Hygrocybe punicea is one of the many Hygrocybe species found on the reservoir banks. The reservoir is listed as a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI) as it has pondweed and stonewort, and common toads breed there. The grassland and scrub surrounding the reservoir is also an SNCI due to the grass snakes and slowworms there. The banks of the reservoir are listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the diversity of waxcap fungi discovered growing on them. WPD appealed against this listing stating the Countryside Council for Wales's (CCW) decision was 'premature, arbirtrary and unfair', but in January 2007 a High Court Judge upheld the SSSI designation and said it was 'an important site'. The reservoir was also listed by Cadw in July 2009 as a building of special architectural or historic interest, despite an appeal from WPD against the listing. Leisure Sailing tuition taking place on Llanishen Reservoir Until Spring 2010, Cardiff Sailing Centre operated at the reservoir offering dinghy sailing, windsurfing, powerboating and canoeing courses. The centre, which is owned and managed by Cardiff County Council had been running at the reservoir for 30 years, though had to relocate to Cardiff Bay to continue operating due to the drain-down. The Centre has gained national recognition as both a 'grass-roots' training centre through the RYA's OnBoard scheme and as a first class race training centre and club. The Centre has also produced National and International class sailors over the years. The reservoir was also once popular with anglers (through the Cardiff Fly Fishing Club), picnickers, birdwatchers and walkers. Fishing at the reservoir stopped in 1998 and many of the other activities have been curtailed since 2004 due to the security fence that was constructed around the banks of the reservoir and (less securely) to the site boundary. Many people still walk between the 'inner' and 'outer' fences, due to a number of natural and man-made gaps in the outer fence and the natural hedges. Although the site is monitored, only some of the 'gaps' are resecured. Proposed redevelopment The reservoir, currently drained until further notice. The inner surrounding fence, with surveillance sign. WPD have proposed redevelopment since 2002. The latest proposal is for 300 new homes, surrounding a much reduced water area, and a connected 'wetland area', as well as a new sailing club and wildlife and education centre. This proposal was recommended by the Planning Inspector, but rejected by the Environment Minister. WPD requested a judicial review of the decision and the minister withdrew her defence after considering WPD's submission. The Court referred the decision back to the minister and a decision is awaited. In March 2010, work started to drain the legal limit of of water from the reservoir into the nearby Nant Fawr stream. WPD say that the drain-down is required as a result of a statutory inspection carried out by WS Atkins PLC. But the Environment Agency have disagreed. The drainage is opposed by opponents of the redevelopment, who claim that the reservoir will take 8 years to refill if totally emptied. The public enquiry considered the requirement for drain-down and the ecological effects in detail. On the drain-down the Planning Inspector concluded that opponents' suspicions had been \\"fully rebutted\\". And after considering a lot of evidence the Inspector concluded that CCW were content for development to proceed and that \\"significant ecological benefits would result from the development\\". In May 2010, WPD applied to the Environment Agency for a discharge licence in order to completely drain the reservoir, which was granted in July 2010. The issue was taken to UK Parliament by Jonathan Evans where he stated that an independent report by the Halcrow Group (advising for the Environment Agency) explained that draining the reservoir could create 'new risks to reservoir safety'. Evans' predecessor, Julie Morgan, had previously taken the issue of saving the reservoir site to parliament, and had garnered support from politicians such as Peter Hain (the Welsh Secretary) and Ed Miliband (later leader of the Labour Party), who visited the site during the May 2010 general election campaign, commenting on the site's tranquillity. In March 2011, WPD applied to Cardiff County Council for planning permission for a miniroundabout on Lisvane Road and listed building consent to alter the structure of the reservoir. Both of these were called in by the Welsh Government. During the appeal a number of changes to the original appeal were submitted by WPD and accepted by all parties. The appeal was heard during the Summer of 2011. On 25 April 2013, The Welsh Government refused the planning appeal from WPD which was for 324 homes. On 30 August 2013, CELSA Group bought both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs from their owner Western Power Distribution, to assure its Cardiff rod mill plant a consistent supply of water from Lisvane. In January 2016, Welsh Water acquired both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs from CELSA Group on a 999-year lease. The campaign against development of the site led by the Reservoir Action Group welcomed the move and hoped that the site could be reopened to the public in future.

The dam was built in 1864‚Äì65 by the Charlestown Water Commission (Charlestown then being separate from Boston) as part of a water supply system. It was located at a narrow point between the Lower and Upper Mystic Lakes, with its west end in Arlington and its east end in Medford. The water system it was a part of eventually merged into the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC), predecessor to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) and the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). As built, the dam was over long and high, with most of that length (about ) consisting of earthen embankments lined with riprap and puddle clay. Near its center is a spillway area consisting of a series of square columns constructed of granite blocks and a masonry apron. These columns are grooved on their inner faces to facilitate the installation of stop logs. A wooden walkway with a plank railing ran across the top of the dam. A wooden fish ladder was built, but removed at a later date. A gatehouse on the Medford side was used to connect the upper lake to a brick-lined aqueduct that delivered the water to Charlestown. The lake area impounded by the dam is . The dam and gatehouse were each listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. By the early 2000s, the dam was known to not be in very good condition, with failing spillway masonry, erosion, and other damage to the dam's stonework. A major storm in 2006 flooded portions of the surrounding area, and highlighted the potential inability of the dam to handle a significant high-water event, leading to catastrophic flooding of downstream areas. Between 2010 and 2012 major work was undertaken to improve the dam's condition. A new spillway was constructed to the east of the old spillway, which received a new spillway apron. Work was done on the embankments and the shores near the upper areas of the dam, and a new fish ladder and bridge were built. The historic gatehouse was also rehabilitated, and modern controls were added, enabling improved control over the water levels behind the dam.

After the war, she was in commission in the United States Coast Guard as the cutter USCGC Matagorda (WAVP-373), later WHEC-373, from 1949 to 1967. Construction, commissioning, and shakedown Matagorda was laid down by the Boston Navy Yard at Boston, Massachusetts, on 6 September 1940. She was launched on 18 March 1941, sponsored by Miss Nancy Rowland Brand, and commissioned at Boston on 16 December 1941 with Commander Stanley J. Michael in command. United States Navy service World War II Matagorda remained at Boston until 3 April 1942, when she departed for shakedown and training in the Chesapeake Bay. She returned to Boston on 22 April 1942. =Operations in the Gal√°pagos Islands, Panama Canal Zone, and Caribbean= After returning to Boston, Matagorda joined Patrol Wings Atlantic (PatWingLant) and loaded torpedoes and ordnance stores at Newport, Rhode Island. On 12 May 1942 she departed Newport and moved to Seymour IslandMatagordas Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry (see http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m6/matagorda.htm) does not specify whether this was North Seymour Island or South Seymour Island, also known as Baltra Island. in the Gal√°pagos Islands. Arriving there on 25 May 1942, she relieved the seaplane tender and began tending seaplanes of Patrol Wing 3 (PatWing 3). After these duties ended, Matagorda arrived at Coco Solo in the Panama Canal Zone on 20 June 1942. She escorted merchant ships to Cuba and Jamaica before resuming seaplane tending duty on 22 July 1942, this time from bases in Central America and South America: She operated out of Puerto Castilla, Honduras, and Cartagena, Colombia until returning to the Panama Canal Zone on 12 November 1942. Following a supply and escort run to Puerto Rico and Trinidad, Matagorda departed Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 23 November 1942 and on 4 December 1942 arrived at Boston for alterations and overhaul. =Voyage to Newfoundland= On 5 January 1943, Matagorda departed Boston to carry troops and supplies to Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, returning to Boston on 14 January 1943. =Return to the Caribbean= After loading aviation supplies at Norfolk, Virginia, Matagorda arrived at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 11 February 1943. She operated primarily out of Puerto Rico until early August 1943, escorting merchant ships and transporting ordnance and aviation supplies to bases in the Caribbean. She called at the Virgin Islands, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Trinidad. =North Atlantic operations= Matagorda departed San Juan on 3 August 1943 and steamed via Bermuda and Norfolk to Argentia, where she arrived on 26 August 1943. On 28 August 1943 she joined Convoy UT-1 and made a voyage to the United Kingdom, arriving at Pembroke, Wales, on 4 September 1943. After unloading cargo, she sailed via Iceland and Boston to Norfolk, arriving there on 27 September 1943. Between 5 October 1943 and 5 March 1944 she made two more round trips across the Atlantic Ocean. She carried men and cargo to Pembroke and Bristol, England, and made escort and supply runs to Casablanca, French Morocco, and Gibraltar. =South Atlantic operations= Departing Boston on 18 April 1944, Matagorda loaded seaplane supplies at Bayonne, New Jersey, and departed Bayonne on 22 April 1944 for Brazil, reaching Recife, Brazil, on 6 May 1944. Until the beginning of April 1945, she conducted extensive training and supply operations and ranged Brazilian waters from Bel√©m to Florian√≥polis. In late May 1944 and again in July 1944 she tended seaplanes at Florian√≥polis. Matagorda interrupted this duty on 24 July 1944 and 25 July 1944, when she searched for and rescued the entire crew of 67 men from the American merchant ship SS William Gaston, torpedoed by a German submarine late on 23 July 1944 off the Brazilian coast. Again, while operating out of Fortaleza, she rescued five survivors of a downed Consolidated PBY-5 Catalina flying boat plus the crew from an assisting Martin PBM Mariner flying boat on 29 August 1944. Matagorda made numerous runs along the Brazilian coast during supply and training missions. Based at Recife, she visited many Brazilian ports including Vit√≥ria, Natal, the island of Fernando de Noronha, Bahia, and Rio de Janeiro. =Voyages to the Caribbean= Matagorda departed Recife on 1 April 1945, touched briefly at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and reached Norfolk on 14 April 1945. From 2 June 1945 to 6 July 1945 she made two runs to Bermuda and Puerto Rico, returning to Norfolk with men of seaplane squadrons. =Conversion to press information ship= Matagorda steamed to New York City on 10 July 1945 to begin conversion to a press information ship. As such her mission would be to provide all proper news facilities for the press and transport them to the coast of Japan where they would cover operations ‚ÄúOlympic‚Äù and ‚ÄúCoronet‚Äù, projected for the invasion of Japan in 1945 and 1946. She was reclassified as a \\"miscellaneous auxiliary\\" and redesignated AG-122 on 30 July 1945. The cessation of hostilities with Japan and end of World War II came on 15 August 1945 made the invasion of Japan unnecessary, and Matagordas conversion was halted in early September 1945. Post-World War II Converted back into a seaplane tender and once again designated AVP-22 as of 10 September 1945, Matagorda departed New York City for Norfolk on 17 October 1945. On 31 October 1945 she departed Norfolk for Orange, Texas. Arriving there on 5 November 1945 for inactivation, she was decommissioned on 20 February 1946 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleets Texas Group at Orange. United States Coast Guard service USCGC Matagorda (WHEC-373) on 21 November 1966, before the Coast Guards adoption of the \\"racing stripe\\" markings on its ships. Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the U.S. Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the Casco-class cutters. The Navy loaned Matagorda to the Coast Guard on 7 March 1949. The Coast Guard converted her into a weather-reporting ship and commissioned her as USCGC Matagorda (WAVP-373) on 8 June 1949. Matagordas primary duty during her Coast Guard service was to serve on ocean stations to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and she engaged in law enforcement operations. Matagorda was stationed at Boston, Massachusetts, from her commissioning on 8 June 1949 until 1954. She was used for law enforcement, ocean station, and search and rescue operations in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1954 she was transferred to Honolulu, Hawaii, and took up duties in the Pacific Ocean similar to those she had performed in the Atlantic. On 26 January 1956, Matagorda delivered clothing from Washington Intermediate School in Honolulu to an orphanage in Japan. In August 1960, Matagorda towed the disabled fishing vessel Wild Goose II. On 12 January 1965, Matagorda stood by the disabled Liberian tanker Saint Helena northwest of Midway Atoll; Saint Helena had sustained hull damage due to heavy seas and was in danger of breaking in two. Matagorda herself sustained damage; she was relieved by the Coast Guard cutter USCGC Bering Strait (WAVP-382) on 13 January 1965 and proceeded to Hawaii, via Midway, in heavy seas. In mid-September 1965, Matagorda escorted the disabled Liberian merchant ship Londias to Honolulu. On 27 February 1966, Matagorda transferred of water to the disabled merchant ship Union Success and took her under tow until relieved of towing duties. Matagorda was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-373 on 1 May 1966. Decommissioning and disposal Matagorda was decommissioned at Honolulu on 15 October 1967, and she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1968. On 30 October 1968, the Coast Guard returned her to the Navy, which sank her as a target off Hawaii in October 1969 in position See also * United States Navy * United States Coast Guard * World War II Notes References Department of the Navy: Naval Historical Center: Online Library of Selected Images: U.S. Navy Ships: USS Matagorda (AVP-22), 1941-1949 * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - USS Matagorda (AVP-22) (AG-122) - USCGC Matagorda (WAVP-373) (WHEC-373) * United States Coast Guard Historians Office Matagorda, 1949 WAVP / WHEC-373 *United States Coast Guard Historian's Office: Mackinac, 1949 WHEC-371 *Bering Strait, 1948 WAVP / WHEC-382 Radio Call Sign: NBYG * Chesneau, Roger.

While it was being studied for generalized anxiety disorder, such research had stopped as of 2017. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and trouble sleeping. Serious side effects may include increased suicidal thoughts or actions in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, bleeding, mania, and SIADH. A withdrawal syndrome may occur if the dose is rapidly decreased. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not generally recommended. It is in the serotonin modulator class of medications and is believed to work both as an SSRI and activator of the 5-HT1A receptor. Vilazodone was approved for medical use in the United States in 2011 and in Canada in 2018. In the United States the wholesale cost for a month of medication is about US$261. In 2017, it was the 285th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions.  Medical uses  According to two eight-week trials in adults, vilazodone has an antidepressant response after one week of treatment. After eight weeks it resulted in a 13% greater response than placebo. Remission rates, however, were not significantly different versus placebo. According to FDA staff, \\"it is unknown whether vilazodone has any advantages compared to other drugs in the antidepressant class.\\" Development for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has been stopped as of 2017. While there is tentative evidence of a small benefit in GAD there is a high rate of side effects. Adverse effects On September 6, 2016, the FDA wrote a letter to Forest Labs requiring a new warnings to be added to the label related to a link between the drug and acute pancreatitis. After a one-year, open-label study assessing the safety and tolerability of vilazodone in people with major depressive disorder, the most common adverse effects were diarrhea (35.7%), nausea (31.6%), and headache (20.0%); greater than 90% of these adverse effects were mild or moderate. In randomized controlled trials, meanwhile, these rates were 28%, 23.4% and 13.3%, respectively. In contrast to other SSRIs, initial trials showed that vilazodone did not cause decreased sexual desire/function, which often cause people to abandon their use. Incidence of adverse effects include: ;Very common adverse effects (incidence >10%): * Nausea * Diarrhea * Headache ;Common adverse effects (1‚Äì10% incidence) * Vomiting * Dry mouth * Dizziness * Insomnia ;Uncommon adverse effects (0.1‚Äì1% incidence): * Somnolence * Paraesthesia * Tremor * Abnormal dreams * Libido decreased * Restlessness * Akathisia * Restless legs syndrome * Abnormal orgasms (male persons only) * Delayed ejaculations (male persons only) * Erectile dysfunction (male persons only) * Fatigue * Feeling jittery * Palpitations * Ventricular premature contractions * Arthralgia * Increased appetite ;Rare adverse effects (<0.1% incidence): * Serotonin syndrome‚Äîa serious adverse effect characterised by: **Nausea **Vomiting **Mental status change (e.g. confusion, hallucinations, agitation, coma, stupor) **Muscle rigidity **Tremor **Myoclonus **Hyperreflexia‚Äîoverresponsive/overactive reflexes **Hyperthermia‚Äîelevated body temperature **Autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, dizziness, abnormally excessive sweating, etc.) * Mania/hypomania‚Äîa potentially dangerously elated/agitated mood.

Pregnancy  Antidepressant exposure (including vilazodone) is associated with shorter average duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). It is uncertain whether there is an increased rate of septal heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed an SSRI in early pregnancy.  Pharmacology  Vilazodone acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (IC50 = 2.1 nM; Ki = 0.1 nM) and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist (IC50 = 0.2 nM; IA = ~60‚Äì70%). It has negligible affinity for other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C. It also exhibits clinically unimportant inhibitory activity at the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters (Ki = 56 nM for NET and 37 nM for DAT). Vilazodone is best absorbed with food and has a bioavailability of 72% under fed conditions. The Cmax increased between 147%-160% and the AUC increased between 64%-85% of vilazodone when it was administered with either a fatty or light meal.

This large Queen Anne/Colonial Revival house was built in the early 1890s by Lewis Parkhurst, a partner in the publishing house of Winchester resident Edwin Ginn. Parkhurst's mansion is the last surviving late 19th-century mansion house in Winchester. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history Oak Knoll is set on a large lot at the center of a rough circle formed by Brooks Street and Grove Street in a residential area of southern Winchester. It has a setting at the top of a low hill, whose drama has been reduced somewhat by encroaching development. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with asymmetrical massing and busy slate roof typical of the Queen Anne style. The roof is pierced by four brick chimneys with corbelled tops, another Queen Anne hallmark. The main entrance is located on the eastern side in a corner between cross-gable sections, sheltered by a porch with Colonial Revival detailing. The house stands on land that once belonged to the locally prominent Symmes family. The land was purchased in 1891 by Lewis Parkhurst, who served as Winchester High School principal before joining the publishing firm of Edwin Ginn. He was active in civic affairs, representing the town in the state senate, and serving as president of Middlesex National Bank, the town's first commercial bank.

He is best remembered for his role in the founding of the Salisbury Court Theatre. Actor and playwright Nothing is known of Gunnell's early life or the first phase of his stage career. He acted with the Admiral's Men, then called the Palsgrave's Men, from 1613 to 1622. When the Palsgrave's Men received their renewed charter and their new name on 4 January 1613, Gunnell was already a sharer in the company. Despite the scantiness of the documentary record for the Palsgrave's troupe, Gunnell can be seen moving up into a managerial responsibility over his years with the company. In the 1613 charter he is listed twelfth of the fourteen sharers. On the company's 1618 lease of the Fortune Playhouse from owner Edward Alleyn, Gunnell is fourth of ten. And when the company leased the rebuilt Fortune in 1622, Gunnell is listed first.John Tucker Murray, English Dramatic Companies, 1558‚Äì1642, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1910; pp. 212‚Äì15. The fire that destroyed the Fortune on 9 December 1621 also wiped out the costumes and play manuscripts of the Palsgrave's Men. In the difficult period that followed, Gunnell appears to have left acting to concentrate of management. He also made a venture at writing plays. His comedy The Hungarian Lion appeared in 1623, and his The Way to Content All Women, or How a Man May Please His Wife followed in 1624.Joseph Quincy Adams, Shakespearean Playhouses, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1917; pp. 368‚Äì9. Neither of his plays has survived. Salisbury Court Gunnell partnered with William Blagrave, Sir Henry Herbert's assistant in the office of the Master of the Revels, to establish the Salisbury Court Theatre in 1629. The Salisbury Court was one of the so- called \\"private\\" theatres of the era, comparable to the Blackfriars or the Cockpit, as opposed to the \\"public\\" theatres like the Fortune or the Globe that catered to a broad audience. Since the private theatres were prestigious and lucrative ‚Äì their minimum ticket price was five or six times higher than the public theatres' penny ‚Äì the move from public to private made business sense, and Gunnell was not the first theatre manager to pursue this course. (Christopher Beeston, manager of the public Red Bull Theatre, built the private Cockpit in 1616‚Äì17.) Along with their new theatre, Gunnell and Blagrave intended to start their own new acting company, called the Children of the Revels. Their plan was to organize a troupe of boy players, comparable to the boys' companies of the previous generation, the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul's. (Christopher Beeston would make the same effort, though more fortunately, when he started Beeston's Boys in 1637.) The Blagrave/Gunnell troupe was not a success, since an outbreak of bubonic plague forced the London theatres to close in 1630 ‚Äì though Stephen Hammerton, the popular young actor who found fame with the King's Men, emerged from it.Andrew Gurr, The Shakespearean Stage, 1574‚Äì1642, third edition, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1992; pp. 63‚Äì4. Business difficulties apparently tempted Gunnell to try to sell his theatrical enterprise; but he and the buyer, Christopher Babham, could not agree on terms and soon went to court over their disagreement.G. E. Bentley, \\"The Salisbury Court Theatre and Its Boy Players,\\" Huntington Library Quarterly, Vol. 40, No. 2 (February 1977), pp. 129‚Äì49. Gunnell remained in the theatre, and brought the re-organized Prince Charles's Men (a troupe that included some of his old Palsgrave's compatriots) into the Salisbury Court in 1631.

From 1180 he was also Duke of Saxony (as Bernhard III or Bernhard I).Different counting traditions developed, following the arguments, that Bernhard's dukedom was either (1) a successor of the old stem duchy of Saxony, with its two prior dukes named Bernhard or (2) the much smaller territorial rest of Saxony remaining after the carve-up of the old duchy in 1180 formed the so- called Younger Duchy of Saxony, whose first duke of this name was then Count Bernhard of Anhalt. Bernhard's great-great-great-great grandson of the same name is thus counted as Bernhard II. Both traditions compete, more so with Bernard sometimes counted I or III, less so with his son Albert I, who is usually counted first, although his grandfather Albert the Bear was the first Saxon duke of that name between 1138 and 1142, however, before the carve-up. Life Bernhard was the youngest of the seven sons of Albert the Bear (d. 1170), Duke of Saxony from 1138 to 1142 and first Margrave of Brandenburg from 1157, by his wife Sophie of Winzenburg. In 1157 he was present together with his father and brothers at the funeral of the Wettin margrave Conrad of Meissen. Two years later, Bernhard accompanied Emperor Frederick Barbarossa to Italy with his brother Margrave Otto I of Brandenburg. Count of Anhalt After the death of his father in 1170, Bernhard inherited the estates around Ascaria (Aschersleben) in the Saxon Schwabengau and the adjacent Gau Serimunt between the Saale, Mulde, and Elbe rivers in the former Saxon Eastern March. These territories eventually emerged as the nucleus of the Ascanian Principality of Anhalt, named after Anhalt Castle near Harzgerode. When his elder brother Albert died without male issue in 1172, Bernhard also inherited his County of Ballenstedt. In the same year he solicited the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in the Imperial Diet of Goslar for possession of Pl√∂tzkau, which passed to him in 1173. However, a dispute over the rule of the Pl√∂tzkau lordship sparked a fierce conflict with the Welf duke Henry the Lion that led to the destruction of Aschersleben and Gr√∂ningen and nearly resulted in the destruction of Halberstadt. Bernhard nonetheless was able to confirm his possessions. Fall of Henry the Lion When Henry the Lion was outlawed by the Emperor in 1180, the Reichstag also dispossessed him of his fiefs (W√ºrzburg and the Duchies of Bavaria and Saxony). In Gelnhausen on 13 April 1180, Bernhard was granted the eastern part of the Welf lands, including the Archbishopric of Bremen-Hamburg, which was passed on to his elder brother Siegfried, and the Duchy of Saxony. This latter award was without real value, however, since this duchy was a radically reduced territory consisting of three unconnected parcels of land along the river Elbe: (1) Hadeln around Otterndorf, (2) a parcel around Lauenburg upon Elbe and (3) a parcel around Wittenberg upon Elbe. Previously the duchy had been divided, so that Bernhard could only receive the region between Meissen and the Mark of Brandenburg as his formal possession. Besides these, he also received several small territories: the towns of Aken and Wittenberg and the Burgraviate of Magdeburg. The dignity Duke of Saxony, Angria and Westphalia was only an empty title. The rich lands of Engern and Westphalia, in addition to the ducal title of Highness, were conferred on the Archbishopric-Electorate of Cologne. The counts of Holstein were released from their homage to the Saxon dukes, the County of Stade was taken by the Archbishop of Bremen, L√ºbeck became an Imperial City, the Saxon Palatinate was bestowed on Count Hermann of Thuringia and, in addition, the Saxon bishops took back their fiefs. Bernhard was forced to support the Emperor in his renewed war against Henry the Lion in 1181. In spite of his defeat, Henry the Lion was able to preserve his Allodial title, from which the Duchy of Brunswick and L√ºneburg was later formed. Ruling as Duke of Saxony In Nordalbingien and the areas between the Elbe and the Baltic Sea, Bernhard's vassals soon rebelled against him and gave their support to Henry the Lion. Bernhard tried to assert his claims, thanks to the support of his brothers Otto I of Brandenburg and Siegfried, Archbishop of Bremen. At first the vassals of Artlenburg swore an oath of fidelity. After them, the counts of Ratzeburg, Danneberg, Luckow and Schwerin also swore. However, the most powerful of these vassals, Count Adolf III of Holstein, would not accept Bernhard's lordship and became his adversary. Conflicts broke out around Dithmarschen, in western Holstein, but without success for Adolf. After Adolf's defeat, Lauenburg (Polabenburg) on the lower Elbe, became the focal point for opposition to Bernhard's rule. Determined to eliminate the opposition against him in his lands, he levied high taxes on rebellious territories, which led to an attack against Lauenburg and its destruction in 1182, followed by the restoration of the fortress.Cordula Bornefeld, \\"Die Herz√∂ge von Sachsen-Lauenburg\\", in: Die F√ºrsten des Landes: Herz√∂ge und Grafen von Schleswig, Holstein und Lauenburg [De slevigske hertuger; German], Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen (ed.) on behalf of the Gesellschaft f√ºr Schleswig- Holsteinische Geschichte, Neum√ºnster: Wachholtz, 2008, pp. 373-389, here p. 383. In 1183 another of Bernhard's brothers, Count Dietrich of Werben died without surviving male issue. His possessions fell mostly to Bernhard. Warfare involving Henry the Lion also expanded to the Slavic countries. Henry Borwin I, the son of Pribislav, was a supporter of Henry the Lion like his father, and remained an opponent of Bernhard. His cousin Nicholas I, granted Burg Malchow by Henry the Lion in 1164, lost part of it due to his association with Bernhard. Borwin allied himself with Duke Bogislaw I of Pomerania and Nicholas with Jaromar I, Prince of R√ºgen, a faithful vassal of Denmark. But shortly after Bogislaw had to punish Borwin (in response to a secret order of the emperor) with the help of King Canute VI of Denmark for his refusal to render homage, by which his lands were split between the Elbe and Or to the Empire and Denmark. Borwin was taken into captivity by King Canute and was forced, like Nicholas, to accept his lands from the king as fiefs. After incursions of the Danes in Pomerania in 1184 and 1185, Bogislaw shared the same destiny. With the success of the Danes, the Emperor in 1184 pressed for a political balance between Bernhard and his vassal. Count Adolf of Holstein kept the disputed regions, however he had to pay 700 marks to Bernhard and swear the oath of fidelity that he had earlier refused to do. Counts Bernhard of Ratzeburg and Gunzelin of Schwerin were also obliged to make payments. The destroyed Lauenburg had to be rebuilt. However, after Henry's return in 1188 it came again to discussions with Bernhard, who finally lost the town of Bardowick. As Duke of Saxony, Bernhard became at the same time Marshal of the Holy Roman empire. He asserted this important post for the first time in 1190 at the coronation of Emperor Henry VI, but spoiled his good terms with the Emperor through his opposition to turning over the hereditary German crown to the House of Hohenstaufen. In 1198 he supported Philipp of Swabia as Emperor. Philipp was killed on 21 June 1208 by Otto of Wittelsbach at Altenburg in Bamberg. Thereupon a new imperial election was held in Halberstadt and (with Bernhard's vote included) Otto of Brunswick was elected on 22 September and crowned immediately in Frankfurt as Otto IV. Otto IV, who meanwhile had fallen out with Pope Innocent III over Sicily, supported the reascension of Valdemar, the papally dismissed Prince-Archbishop of Bremen.Adolf Hofmeister, \\"Der Kampf um das Erbe des Stader Grafen zwischen den Welfen und der Bremer Kirche (1144‚Äì1236)\\", In: Geschichte des Landes zwischen Elbe und Weser: 3 vols., Hans-Eckhard Dannenberg and Heinz-Joachim Schulze (eds.) on behalf of the Landschaftsverband der ehemaligen Herzogt√ºmer Bremen und Verden, Stade: Landschaftsverband der ehem.

So in 1211 Bernhard escorted his brother-in-law Valdemar into the city of Bremen, de facto regaining the see. With his acquisition of Saxon estates, Bernhard moved his residence and court to Wittenberg. In 1260 (with effect as from 1296 on) his grandsons split the Duchy into the Duchies of Saxe-Wittenberg (German: Herzogtum Sachsen-Wittenberg) and Saxe-Lauenburg (German: Herzogtum Sachsen- Lauenburg), the latter holding the unconnected two northern territories. Wittenberg remained a residence of the House of Ascania until the extinction of this line in 1422. On his death, aged seventy-two, Bernhard was buried beside his father Albert and several of his brothers in the Church of the Benedictine monastery in Ballenstedt.

Description and history The Robert Bacon House stands in southern Winchester, on the west side of Mystic Valley Parkway near the point where the Aberjona River empties into the Upper Mystic Lake. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboarded front and back. The side walls are built out of brick, rising to a parapet and two end chimneys. Its front facade is five bays wide and symmetrical, with the center entrance sheltered by a portico supported by fluted Doric columns and topped by a balustrade. The entry is framed by sidelight and transom windows with tracery. The interior also retains high quality wood work from its period of construction. The house was built about 1830 to a design by John Kutts, a prominent Boston-based architect. The house is of particular note because its original architectural drawings survive, as do contractor bills and other documents related to its construction. It was built for Robert Bacon, who had been using the water privilege on the Aberjona River since 1824 for the manufacture of felt hats. He purchased the land on the west side of the river in 1825, and had this house placed with a view toward his mill and worker village. The mills supposedly burned down in 1843, but were rebuilt and leased to other industrial operations by the Bacons. Winchester's Bacon Street is named for him, and the area of the mill village was known for many years as Baconville.

Nine and one-half acres of property was purchased in 1904 by Oren Sanborn, younger son of James Sanborn, the co- founder of Chase & Sanborn Coffee Company. History Oren Sanborn and his wife Lorena (Rena) had lived in Winchester since 1901. The Sanborn House, designed in the beaux-arts style by architects Clinton M. Hill and Thomas M. James, was erected in 1906/07 at a cost of $250,000. Their new home, which they called Aigremont, with its understated exterior and ornamented interior, set the stage for their role as prominent Winchester citizens. Oren was a member of the Winchester Country Club and the Calumet Social Club. Rena, active in Winchester Society, helped found the Winchester Hospital and led fundraising efforts for the hospital for many years. The family fortune declined in the early 1920s and the house was sold. The Downes family, founders of Downes Lumber of Boston, used it as a family home for the next two decades. Their decision to sell the house and surrounding land to the Religious of Christian Education, an order of nuns, was significant in the ongoing preservation of the house during the years after World War II when so many large homes of the Victorian and Edwardian period were destroyed. The nuns built a grade school, the Marycliff Academy, on what had been the western paddock and used the house as their residence. In 1969, the Town of Winchester purchased the Marycliff Academy and the adjacent Sanborn house. The school became the present Ambrose Elementary School (rebuilt in 2005), and the Sanborn House became home to a variety of occupants, most recently the town Recreation Department. In 1981, the Sanborn House was one of the first properties in Winchester to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Sanborn House was vacated in 2003 to facilitate construction of the new Ambrose School. In 2005 the Massachusetts Historical Commission recognized the Sanborn House as a significant and endangered property, awarding the Winchester Historical Society a Preservation Project Funds grant to begin the planning process for restoring the house. Sanborn House Historical & Cultural Center In March 2006 the Winchester Historical Society signed a long term lease for the Sanborn House with the Town of Winchester. The Society took on the stewardship for the restoration of the property and its conversion into the Sanborn House Historical and Cultural Center for the use of the community as well as a home for the Society. In 2010, the Society appointed its first Executive Director of the Sanborn House. The Society now has a Site Manager, in place of an Executive Director, who handles the operations/maintenance of the house along with overseeing event rentals. In 2011, the restoration project of the exterior facade, funded in part by a matching grant from the Massachusetts Historical Commission was started and completed.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on May 19, 1956, and stars Tweety and Sylvester.The title is a play on \\"three-cornered hat\\". The voices were performed by Mel Blanc. It is one of a few Sylvester and Tweety shorts wherein Tweety does not directly influence the outcome. The cartoon is a parody of Dragnet, with Tweety narrating the short in the style of Joe Friday. Plot Tweety narrates his daily activities as he is spotted, then chased by Sylvester. Utilizing a Jack Webb impression, Tweety delivers his signature \\"I tawt I taw a puddy tat\\" line (adding the line \\"I checked\\" in the middle of it), then describes his adversary in detail: \\"A bwack puddy tat, wed nose, white chest. Name...'Tilvester.\\" Tweety describes Sylvester's attempts, as follows: * The opening scene, where Sylvester simply crosses the street and walks up the stairs to the room Tweety is located in. An unseen woman roars \\"Go away! You alley cat! You hooligan! You troublemaker!\\" and throws plates at him. Sylvester scurries down the stairs and out of the building. * Subsequently, Sylvester builds a makeshift bridge of wooden planks to get to the building across the way where Tweety is housed. The bridge collapses as the nails come loose at the base, due to the cat's weight and its poor construction. * Syvlester then uses a swing to get to Tweety's apartment, but smashes into a telephone pole. * Sylvester's fourth attempt involves the use of a pilot's ejector seat to get at the high story window where Tweety is, but it hurls him straight through overhead wires, splitting the cat into several lengthwise pieces. * Tweety feeds with the pigeons at the city library. Sylvester stops by and chases his prey into an automat. Tweety takes refuge behind a window (conveniently labeled \\"Tweety Pie,\\" right next to the lemon pie). Sylvester inserts a nickel into the slot, opens the door, and gets a spring-loaded pie thrown into his face. * Following a mountain blizzard, Tweety puts spoons on his feet (as snowshoes) to search for food. Sylvester comes after him on skis, and it appears the speedy cat will catch his dinner...until he crashes into a tree. * Tweety hides in a treetop in a mine field. Sylvester uses a metal detector to try to avoid the mines, but Tweety throws a magnet at the cat, which draws all the mines at him and results in an explosion. * A chase on a high wooden bridge in Colorado, where Tweety hides beneath the deck, out of the cat's reach. A determined Sylvester saws a hole in the center of the bridge, but does not realize he is standing in the middle of the portion he is sawing off until well after he has begun his plummet to the river below. Unseen by his predator, Tweety steps out of his way. A British-accented man in a fishing boat spots the falling projectile headed straight for him and takes note of the situation, using Tweety's catchphrase: \\"I tawt I taw a puddy tat!\\" Sylvester plunges straight through the boat's hull, causing the cat, the man and his boat to sink (\\"I did! I did! I did...\\" the man states, bubbling the last line \\"...taw a puddy tat!\\" as he sinks below the surface to end the cartoon).

A reverse dual-currency note (RDC) is a note which pays a foreign interest rate in the investor's domestic currency. A power reverse dual-currency note (PRDC) is a structured product where an investor is seeking a better return and a borrower a lower rate by taking advantage of the interest rate differential between two economies. The power component of the name denotes higher initial coupons and the fact that coupons rise as the foreign exchange rate depreciates. The power feature comes with a higher risk for the investor, which characterizes the product as leveraged carry trade. Cash flows may have a digital cap feature where the rate gets locked once it reaches a certain threshold. Other add-on features include barriers such as knockouts and cancel provision for the issuer. PRDCs are part of the wider Structured Notes Market.  Market  The majority of investors are Japanese with US$9 billion worth of notes issued in 2003 and the issued notional increasing every year thereafter up until 2008 when it sharply declined. Major participants in the market include issuers (usually Supranationals) of the notes under their Euro Medium Term Note program. Also heavily involved are PRDC swap hedgers - the major ones include JPMorgan Chase, Nomura Securities Co., UBS Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays Investment Bank, Credit Suisse, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Payoff and cashflows  The investor pays a coupon times a fixed rate in currency c1 and receives a coupon times a fixed rate in currency c2 times current FX rate divided by the FX rate at the inception of the deal. However, the cash flows are always guaranteed to be positive for the investor. The investor, therefore, has the option to receive cash flows making the payoff similar to a Bermudan style FX option. The swap house is, thus, selling a series of Currency options with a floating rate as a premium; the rate is usually subtracted with a spread. File:Derivatives PRDC.png \\\\sum_{t=1}^{n} MAX(N \\\\frac {FX_t} {FX_0} r_{1t} - r_{2t}(N-1),0) where :: N = \\\\text {notional} :: t = \\\\text {time of a cash flow} :: 0 = \\\\text {time at the start of the deal} :: r_1 = \\\\text {fixed rate at t of currency1.

A set of rates for every t are fixed at time 0. } :: FX = \\\\text {exchange rate between currency1 and currency2}  Model  The pricing of PRDCs used to be done using 3-factor grid/lattice or Monte Carlo models where one factor represents the short rate in currency1; the second factor the short rate in currency2; and the third factor the movement in the FX rate between currency1 and currency2. Model choice for the interest rate factors varies - for speed reasons, popular choices are Hull-White model, Black- Karasinski model, and extended Cheyette Model. FX model choice also varies among houses - popular choices are Dupire-type local volatility models, stochastic SABR Volatility Models, or models which allow mixing of the two. Nowadays, most dealers use a variant of the industry-standard LIBOR market model to price the PRDCs.  Inputs  * Correlation constants between each factor. Those correlation parameters are usually estimated historically or calibrated to market prices * FX volatility calibrated to FX Options and user inputs * IRS volatilities of each currency calibrated based on IRS Swaptions and yield curves * Yield curve of money market rate1 and rate2 based on deposit rates, futures prices and swap rates * Basis swap spread curves * Spot FX rate  Computation  Plain vanilla PRDCs can be broken down into a string of vanilla options. For Callable PRDCs - which are not replicable - the present value and the risks are now computed using quasi-Monte Carlo simulations and can take several hours. The same can be said of the TARN PRDCs and Chooser PRDCs (which are also callable).  Hedging  A plain vanilla PRDC is exposed to the movements in interest rates, FX, volatility (on both interest rates and fx), correlation and basis. Those risks are hedged with interest rate swaps in each currency to reduce interest rate risk, interest rate swaptions in each currency to reduce interest rate volatility exposures, FX Options to reduce FX volatility exposures and Basis swaps to reduce basis risk. Correlation exposure can be partially hedged with correlation swaps. While such hedges are theoretically possible, there are a lot of practical difficulties, largely due to the following situation. The owners of the PRDC notes, usually retail investors, don't hedge their risks in the market. Only the banks, which are all short the notes, actively hedge and rebalance their positions. In other words, if there is a significant move in FX, for example, all the PRDC books will need the same kind of FX volatility rebalancing at the same time. The note holders would be the natural counterparty for the hedge, but they don't take part in this market (similar to buyers of portfolio insurance in 1987). This situation often creates \\"one way markets\\" and sometimes liquidity squeeze situations in long term FX volatilities, basis swaps or long end AUD interest rate swaps. The volume of PRDC notes issued has been so large that the hedging and rebalancing requirements far exceed the available liquidity in several key markets. However every model is derived under the assumption that there is sufficient liquidity - in other words, they are potentially mispricing the trades because in this market, a few of the key standard Black‚ÄìScholes assumptions (such as zero transaction cost, unlimited liquidity, no jumps in price) break down. No active secondary market ever existed for PRDC and banks usually mark their books to some consensus level provided by an independent company. Anecdotal evidence indicates that nobody would show a bid anywhere close to that consensus level.  PRDC during the Subprime Crisis  PRDC has been the subject of much attention in the market during the subprime mortgage crisis. By the nature of the trade, investment banks hedging the risks for PRDC structured note issuers will have a short cross gamma position between FX volatility, interest rate and FX. In a volatile market where market parameters move in large and correlated steps, investment banks are forced to rebalance their hedges at a loss, often daily. In particular, when FX spot goes up, the hedger for a PRDC note is expected to pay more coupons on a PRDC note. Thus, the hedger is more likely to call the note, reducing the expected duration of the note. In this situation, the hedger has to partially unwind the hedges done at the inception of the PRDC note. For example, the hedge would have to pay swaps in the foreign currency. If FX spot moves in a correlated fashion with the foreign currency swap rate (that is, foreign currency swap rate increases as FX spot increases), the hedger would need to pay a higher swap rate as FX spot goes up, and receive a lower swap rate as FX spot goes down. This is an example of how the hedger of a PRDC note is short cross gamma. This was the main driver behind the increased market volatility in FX skew, long dated FX volatility, long dated Japanese Yen and Australian dollar interest rate, especially during the last quarter of 2008.

Description and history The Wedgemere Historic District is located west of Winchester's town center, and just east of Cambridge Street (Massachusetts Route 3), a major north-south artery in the town. It is bounded on the north by Warren Street, on the east by Wildwood and Fletcher Streets, and on the south by Church Street. It is bounded on the west by Cambridge Street, but excludes properties located there. The area is characterized by large houses set back on large grassy lots, with a high level of quality and architectural character. The styles that predominate in its buildings are Queen Anne, Shingle, Colonial Revival, and Tudor Revival. Almost all of the houses were built between 1890 and 1920, with only outbuildings such as garages intruding on the landscape. The subdivision was created by a syndicate established by Frank Forsyth, a local resident, and syndicate of Boston-based investors, who acquired of land in 1891. Development was slowed by the Panic of 1893, which resulted in the dissolution of the syndicate. Over the following decades, a variety of houses were built on the land platted out by the syndicate. Early houses in the district were typically Colonial Revival with some Queen Anne styling, such as the Rice House (10 Oxford Street, c. 1893) and the Davis House (6 Calumet Road, c. 1893). By the 1910s the Craftsman style began to come into vogue, with houses like the Nickerson House (25 Calumet, built 1912). One of the most unusual houses in the district is the Spanish Revival Lombard House at 105 Church Street, built in 1908.

It is roughly bounded Mt. Vernon and Washington Streets, Waterfield Road, Church and Main Streets. The district includes a number of Romanesque Revival buildings, including Winchester Town Hall and the Winchester Savings Bank building on Mount Vernon Street. Noted architects who contributed to the district include Robert Coit and Asa Fletcher. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The area that is now Winchester was first settled beginning in the 1640s, and was known as South Woburn. What is now the town center began as the site of a grist mill and bridge on the Aberjona River. The community remained largely agrarian until the Boston and Lowell Railroad was built through the area in 1835. This spurred immediate growth and prompted the growth of a village center. When Winchester was separated from Woburn in 1850, it became the town's civic and religious center, with the construction of the First Congregational Church (first church burned 1853, present church built 1854) on the west side of the center. Commercial and civic buildings from the early period of growth, and of a second spurt of growth after the American Civil War survive in the center, including the Romanesque Winchester Town Hall (1887), and the 1879 Brown and Stanton Block at Main and Mount Vernon Streets. Growth continued in the early 20th century, with the Beaux Arts Lincoln School (1903), the Colonial Revival Police and Fire Station (1914), and the Gothic Revival library (1931), designed by local architect Robert Coit. The most significant ahistorical modification to the district is the elevation of the Boston and Lowell line, effectively bisecting the district.

First developed by Berufsbildende Schule 1 Kaiserslautern in 2006 and later by Carnegie Mellon University in 2007, flower robots are used as intelligent home appliances, with capabilities such as sensing, simple actuation for movements, and effectors such as lights or humidifier. Overview Similar to a flower, the robotic flower contains components such stems and leaves, with small sensors and effectors embedded in the structure. The flower robot developed at Carnegie Mellon University utilized a seven degree of freedom structure, with one used to move the stem towards the left and right, and six other for moving the leaves. Built using simple DC servos, the base structure of the robot actuates the leaves, and uses the IR sensors built in on three of its petals to track objects. Designed as an intelligent home appliance, the robotic flower has a variety of different functions. Primarily, the flower robot is used as a background sensing device, as it contains sensors for temperature, pressure, voice and light intensity. Unlike other sensors with similar purpose, the appearance of the flower robot makes it easier blend into various rooms, providing more convenient control and accurate results. In addition, the flower robot is capable of small movements using its servos, which can be used to mimic the blooming flower and the stirring of leaves in the wind, creating an aesthetically pleasing environment. Other functions of the flower robot include vision or voice recording, illumination and the use of a scent emitter and a humidifier. Development The development of the flower power robot has sparked interests in the shape memory alloy research, as such smart materials can better approximate the motions of a real flower. A group of Korean researchers proposed at the 2007 International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics the design of a new flower power robot with such materials, and an improvement in performance of the flower robot were shown by numerical simulations.

The organic farm grows and sells produce and offers educational programs for children and adults on land now owned by the Wright-Locke Land Trust.  History  The property was owned around the turn of the 19th century by Philemon Wright, a noted explorer of Canada, and was developed by the family of Josiah Locke, to whom he sold the property in 1800 before embarking on his explorations. The Greek Revival farmhouse was probably built around 1828 by Asa Locke. The farm remained in the Locke family into the 20th century. In 2007, the Town of Winchester purchased the farm, then 20 acres, for $14 million to prevent the construction of a 300-unit housing development. The intention at the time was to sell 12.5 acres to a developer who planned to build fewer homes. However, the developer defaulted on payments in 2010 and forfeited a deposit on the land, leaving the town in the hole. Advocates then launched a fund-raising campaign to prevent any residential development on the land. In May 2015, Town Meeting members voted to authorize the Board of Selectmen to sell the 12.5 acres to the Wright-Locke Land Trust for $8.6 million. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It is one of a few working farms in Winchester.  The Farm Today  Wright-Locke Farm draws visitors to its farm stand, outdoor concerts, lectures, workshops, educational camps for children, and pick-your-own raspberries. It also is a popular spot for weddings. Walking paths are open to public year-round. In 2017, the farm kicked off a capital campaign to raise $4.8 million to build an Education Center with a kitchen and classroom. Such a building would allow the farm to run its educational programming year-round.

He was the founder of Nihon Koden Shindo Ryu Karatedo and master of Felton Messina.  History  At the age of 15 he began to practice the Okinawan style of Karate called Tomari- Ha in 1939. On March 1943, he graduated from high school after having lost 2 years of classes due to World War II, time which he used to concentrate in the study of Karate. That year he began to study other Okinawan styles such as, Shuri-Te and To-Te. Between April 1943 and March 1944 he dedicated himself fully to the practice and perfection of Karate. On April 1944, he joined the Japanese Marines. By the time the war ended in 1945, he was part of one of the Air Force squads from Kurashiki. When the news of Japan's defeat reached him, he spent 10 days considering if he should commit Seppuku. After those 10 days he firmly decided to live and help others through Karate-Do. On August 1945, he returns to the city of Satsumasendai.  Creation of the style  Between 1945 and 1952 he intensified his Karate practices, traveling throughout Japan and dedicating himself to the study of two styles of Karate: Nihon Shindo Karate-Do and Nihon-Den Karate-Do. In 1952 he joined the Fire Department in his hometown and for the first time taught Karate. On the morning of March 28, 1964, in a Shinto temple called Isekotaigingie in the province of Mie, Japan, he created Nihon Koden Shindo Ryu. This new style of Karate he created was based on the modifications he made to the techniques he learned from the other styles of karate.  Actuality  In 1975 he traveled to the Dominican Republic with Professor Jamaguchi (6th Dan in Judo) and Kenji Moriyama (5th Dan) to give Karate-Do classes. In one month, he performed exhibitions throughout the island and left Felton Messina in charge of the style in the Dominican Republic. On April, 1980 he retires from being Chief of the Fire Department in Satsumasendai. He dedicated his whole life to the practice and teaching of Karatedo and was the So-shihan (Supreme Master) of Nihon Koden Shindo Ryu until his death on September 16, 2003. Before his death in 2003, he gave Felton Messina the rank of So Shihan and left him in charge of the style outside Japan. The person in charge of the style in Japan is Hamada's nephew So Shihan Eturou Takeshita.

The bank is directed by a board of trustees elected by the bank's corporators, a group of civic-minded, local individuals. Since the Bank is mutual, all profits from operations are reinvested in the bank. History The Winchester Savings Bank was established by the Massachusetts Legislature and incorporated on March 3, 1871. The first meeting of the Corporators was held in Lyceum Hall (the building at the corner of Main and Mt. Vernon Streets in Winchester) on July 11, 1871. The Bank first opened its doors for business on August 26, 1871, in a banking room on the north side of Main Street. It was generally predicted that the Bank would not be a success, but on opening day, $11,058 was deposited, with most of this total coming from the bank's trustees and corporators. In 1880, the bank moved to the second floor of the Brown and Stanton Block on Main Street, and remained there until 1892 when it moved into its newly constructed building at 26 Mt. Vernon Street. The bank's main office was moved on December 10, 1979 to its present location at 661 Main Street. Since its founding in 1871, the bank has grown into a full-service financial institution.

The A-80 was originally patterned after the SIG P220.\\" Astra A-80, A-90, A-100 (Spain).\\" Modern Firearms Design The A-100 is a recoil-operated, locked breech design with improved Browning-style linkless locking. The lock up is similar to the Browning High Power or CZ-75 with locking lugs on the top of the barrel which mate with lugs in the slide (not with a single lug in the ejection port like a SIG P22X.) The pistol's safety features include a manual decocking lever, firing pin block, and hammer safety. The A-100 lacks a manual safety, but depends entirely on a deliberate pull of its trigger to fire it; in this way it is similar to the SIG P22X series of pistols. The double-action trigger pull is relatively long and heavy, thereby precluding the need for a safety as the probability of an inadvertent discharge is low. The A-100 resembles the SIG P228 and is similar in overall size and dimension, but differs in several respects, the most visible being the location of the take-down/disassembly lever on the right side of the frame (from the shooter's point of view) as compared to the SIG design, in which it is located on the left. The A-100 is also slightly heavier than the SIG, owing to its all-steel construction. Additionally, the A-100's chamber contour as visible when the slide is fully forward is rounded whereas the SIG design is squared. The configuration of the hammer is also different, with the A-100 having a rounded hammer provided with a lanyard hole and the SIG having a more conventional spur hammer. Magazines are not interchangeable between the A-100 and SIG pistols, however many holsters made for the SIG P229/228 fit the A-100 satisfactorily. The various A-series pistols were submitted unsuccessfully as contenders for Spanish military contracts beginning in the 1970s.

SIDs typically provide functions useful to the driver such as multiple trip odometers, fuel efficiency, estimated range (\\"distance to empty\\" ‚Äì DTE), current CD track or radio station, and also brief description of car system failures. SIDs designed prior to the full General Motors takeover of Saab in 2000 were mounted in the center console, usually just above the head unit and below climate control vents with the exception of 9000 models, possibly after the \\"facelift\\" in the early 1990s. The 9000 featured the SID on the standard instrument cluster, with a car pictogram, showing open doors/tailgate/boot (trunk), lamp failures and low oil pressure in red. If there were no warnings, the white pictogram would disappear. To the right of this was the data display in orange with green background data. This constantly showed instantaneous fuel consumption on an orange moving bar display with other parameters to its left such as alternator voltage, battery cranking voltage during start, outside temperature, estimated fuel range and average fuel consumption, cycled through by pressing an INFO button on the clock on the dashboard. Also displayed were engine check warnings. In addition, the analogue electric clock module could be replaced by a digital unit that scrolled SAAB across the orange LED display on startup before showing the time. This display featured digital trip functions such as distance to destination, average speed, estimated arrival time and adjustable speed warning settings, cycled through and set by pressing several buttons and retaining the R (reset) and INFO button for the instrument cluster. When fitted, the automatic climate control (as opposed to simple air conditioning) showed the selected temperature on green LEDs on the ACC unit fitted in the centre console in degrees C or F, selected by a nearby slide switch. Heated rear window (repeated on the main instrument cluster), heated door mirrors, ventilation outlet selections (including rear side window demist) and ACC mode were also indicated on the ACC unit by green LEDs next to the selector buttons (orange for the electrically heated items). Audio functions were displayed on the head unit, also in the centre console, such as FM Radio Station Name where RDS was available (otherwise just the Radio Frequency) on a green LCD. CD track info was similarly displayed on the console mounted single CD player, where fitted, on its own green LCD. The 9000 SID was not noted for pixel failures since it appears not to be LCD based.

Early years Boulahrouf was also a reader of al-Umma newspaper, organ of the Star of North Africa party, and contributed to the formation of the first groups of Muslim Scouts in the region of Annaba. He also participated in organizing a demonstration of solidarity with the Tunisian Destour Party and was first arrested in 1938. As soon as the Algerian People's Party was dissolved, Boulahrouf's activity took place underground and he worked to broaden the grassroots of the party dissolved. He participated in the founding of the Movement of Friends of the Manifesto and Liberty. He was one of the organizers of the events of May 8, 1945, which earned him to be arrested again to be released after the proclamation of amnesty for political prisoners. On leaving prison, Boulahrouf participated with his companions in the creation of the Special Organisation in which it was designated as responsible for the area encompassing Annaba, Skikda, Ain Beida.

Cheyenne, 113 U.S. 516 (1885), was an appeal from the Supreme Court of the Territory of Wyoming regarding a bill charging that the collection of an illegal tax would involve the plaintiff in a multiplicity of suits as to the title of lots being laid out and sold, which would prevent their sale, and which would cloud the title to all his real estate, states a case for relief in equity.. Background An Act of the Legislature of Wyoming, passed December 13, 1879, required the state auditor to furnish to the territorial board of equalization a list for assessment and taxation of the roadbed, superstructure, and other enumerated property of every railroad and telegraph company in the territory when any portion of the property of such company was situated in more than one county, and required the board to value and assess the property of the corporation for each mile of its road or line, and to certify to the county clerks of the counties in which the property was situated the assessment per mile, specifying the number of miles and amount in each of the counties, and which required the county commissioners to decide and adjust the number of miles and amounts within each precinct, township, or school district within their respective counties and cause such amounts to be entered on the lists of taxable property returned by the assessors, withdrew the duty of assessing fractional parts of such railroad and the property of such companies from all local assessors in the territory, including its incorporated cities. A statute which provides a general scheme for assessing and taxing the property of railroad and telegraph companies as a whole and for distributing it ratably among the different counties and their several precincts, townships and districts according to the number of miles of line in each repeals, as to such property, a power conferred upon the authorities of a city to make provisions for the assessment of the taxes which they were authorized by other provisions of the city charter to assess and collect. The bill in this case was filed by the Union Pacific Railway Company against the City of Cheyenne and its marshal, Ryan, to enjoin the collection of certain city taxes for the year 1880, which the railway company alleges were unlawfully assessed against it. The bill was demurred to by the defendants, and the District Court for the First Judicial District of Wyoming, in which the suit was brought, overruled the demurrer, and granted the injunction prayed for. The defendants adhered to their demurrer and appealed to the supreme court of the territory, and the decree of the district court was reversed and the bill ordered to be dismissed, and the case is now brought here by appeal. Question on certiorari The main question raised by the bill is whether the Union Pacific Railroad, which passes through the whole length of Wyoming Territory, and in its course passes through the City of Cheyenne, with its accompanying telegraph, appurtenances, and rolling stock, is liable to be assessed and valued for the purposes of taxation in Cheyenne by the city authorities, or only by the territorial board of equalization. Opinion of the Court The high court found that the allegations of the bill in this case bring it fairly within the jurisdiction of the court. It showed that it would involve the plaintiff in a multiplicity of suits as to title of lots laid out and being sold; would prevent their sale, and would cloud the title to all its real estate. We think that these results are sufficiently apparent, and render it unnecessary to look further. The allegation of fraud has not been proven, and cannot therefore have any effect in the case. It is unnecessary to inquire into the sufficiency of other grounds for equitable relief which are alleged in the bill. Another point raised by the defendants, not affecting the jurisdiction of the court but the propriety of its taking jurisdiction, is that the complainant ought to have paid the taxes which are conceded to be due to the city for the year 1880. As the court understood the facts stated by the bill (which, of course, the demurrer admits to be true), the complainant did pay to the city all the taxes which would be due upon the assessment and valuation made by the board of equalization, including taxes due on outside property of the company in the city. The court found that the decree of the Supreme Court of Wyoming should be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to enter a decree in favor of the complainant in conformity with this opinion, and it was so ordered.

She served in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean during World War II. In 1948, she was loaned to the United States Coast Guard, in which she served as the cutter USCGC Rockaway (WAVP-377), later WAGO-377, WHEC-377, and WOLE-377, from 1949 to 1972. Construction and commissioning Rockaway was laid down on 30 June 1941 by Associated Shipbuilders, Inc., at Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 14 February 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Z. E. Briggs, and commissioned on 6 January 1943 with Commander H. C. Doan in command. United States Navy service World War II Following shakedown, Rockaway became a unit of the United States Atlantic Fleet in April 1943 with her home base at Norfolk, Virginia. =Transatlantic voyages and North African service= From April 1943 until October 1944, Rockaway delivered supplies and personnel to outlying bases in the North Atlantic Ocean. She transferred a complete seaplane squadron from Newfoundland to England, carried aviation cargo from Norfolk to the aircraft carrier at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, delivered secret radar equipment to England to be used in the invasion of Normandy of 6 June 1944, performed guard ship duty at Casablanca, French Morocco, for two months, and transported aircraft engines to the Azores. Rockaway completed nine round trips across the Atlantic during this interval, steaming independently. On several occasions, she made submarine contacts and dropped depth charges, but with undetermined results. =Invasion of France= During the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, Rockaway performed sundry duties for 20 days, including patrol and convoy work in the English Channel; flagship duty for Admiral J. Wilkes, USN; transportation of United States Army and U.S. Navy personnel; and protection of Allied beachheads against German air attacks. =Operations from the Panama Canal Zone= After a shipyard period in November 1944, Rockaway was based in the Panama Canal Zone, completing two trips to the Galapagos Islands with aviation supplies and personnel. In December 1944 she rescued 13 survivors from a PBM Mariner flying boat which had crashed in the Pacific Ocean off Coco Solo, Panama. =Operations in Brazil= Rockaway operated from Brazil from February 1945 to July 1945, supplying the various naval bases from Bel√©m to Bahia, Brazil, with men and equipment. While steaming to Recife, Brazil, on 21 February 1945, Rockaway, located a disabled tanker and guarded the tanker for three days until a fleet tug arrived on the scene to tank the tanker under tow. =Conversion to press information ship begun= In July 1945, Rockaway began conversion at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, into a press information ship. Reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary and redesignated AG-123 on 30 July 1945, her conversion was designed to allow her to carry 50 correspondents during the invasion of Japan, which was scheduled for 1945-1946. After hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945 before an invasion could occur, she was reconverted into a seaplane tender. =Honors and awards= Rockaway received one battle star for her World War II service. Post-World War II Rockaway departed Boston, Massachusetts, on 26 October 1945. She reported to the Inactive Fleet at Orange, Texas, on 12 November 1945. Decommissioned there on 21 March 1946, Rockaway was placed in reserve and berthed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange.  United States Coast Guard service USCGC Rockaway (WAVP-377, later WAGO-377, WHEC-377, and WOLE-377), sometime prior to the U.S. Coast Guards 1967 adoption of the \\"racing stripe\\" markings on its ships. Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the Casco-class cutters. The U.S. Navy loaned Rockaway to the Coast Guard on 24 December 1948. After undergoing conversion for use as a weather-reporting ship, she was commissioned into the Coast Guard service as the cutter USCGC Rockaway (WAVP-377) on 10 January 1949. Service history Rockaway was stationed at Staten Island in New York City, which remained her home port throughout her Coast Guard career. Her primary duty was to serve on ocean stations in the Atlantic Ocean to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and- rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and engaged in law enforcement operations. In September 1958, Rockaway salvaged a U.S. Navy seaplane from Bermuda. In December 1964, she rescued four people from the merchant ship Smith Voyager. Rockaway was reclassified as an \\"oceanographic ship\\" and redesignated as WAGO-377 in 1965. She took part in a United States Coast Guard Academy cadet cruise in August 1965. On 24 February 1966, Rockaway stood by the British merchant ship Parthia until a commercial tug arrived to assist Parthia. On 1 May 1966, Rockaway again was reclassified, this time as a high endurance cutter, and was redesignated WHEC-377. On 26 September 1966 her period on loan to the Coast Guard ended when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and transferred permanently to the Coast Guard. From 20 January 1967 to 30 March 1967, Rockaway conducted an \\"Eastern Tropical Pacific Cruise\\" in the Pacific off Mexico, where she undertook an oceanographic survey. From November 1967 through January 1968, she conducted an oceanographic survey off Norfolk, Virginia. She was involved in more oceanographic surveys over the Mid-Atlantic Shelf from 6 May 1968 to 12 May 1968 and again from 11 July 1968 to 18 July 1968. From 14 January 1969 to 19 January 1969, she conducted a survival craft drift project east of the Chesapeake Bay. In August 1969, she conducted extensive oceanographic work associated with the Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment. She then conducted more oceanographic surveys from Nova Scotia, Canada, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, from 20 October 1969 to 23 November 1969, over the Mid-Atlantic Outer Continental Margin from 30 March 1970 to 5 April 1970, from Nova Scotia to Cape Hatteras between 19 May 1970 and 14 June 1970, and near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland between 6 October 1970 and 21 October 1970. In November 1970, she surveyed a nerve gas dump site. Rockaway conducted a fisheries research cruise from Nova Scotia to Cape Hatteras between 2 March 1971 and 3 April 1971. Another research cruise took her back to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland in May 1971. From 15 July 1971 to 18 September 1971, she studied the influence of Mediterranean effluent upon the Atlantic Ocean. On 23 September 1971, Rockaway was once again reclassified, this time as an \\"off- shore law enforcement vessel,\\" and was redesignated WOLE-377. Her main mission was to track the locations of the Russian and Japanese fishing fleets that were at that time depleting the fishing areas off the North Atlantic coast of North America. As a byproduct of this mission, Rockaway also conducted search and rescue missions that got her the nickname \\"Lobster Patrol\\". Decommissioning and disposal Rockaway was decommissioned on 29 January 1972Per the United States Coast Guard Historian's Office (at http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Rockaway_1948.asp). However, NavSource.org (at http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/43/4329.htm) places her decommissioning date on 21 September 1972. She was sold for scrapping on 21 October 1970 to BV Intershift of Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

History Plaque commemorating Mexican solidarity with Chile during the Military dictatorship of Chile (1973‚Äì1990). Chile and Mexico both share a common history in that they were both hosts to advanced indigenous societies and were both colonized by Spain. Diplomatic relations were established in the 1820s soon after both nations obtained independence from Spain. In 1825 Chile opened a consulate in Mexico City and in Mazatl√°n in 1875. On 7 March 1831, both nations signed a Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.Primeros contactos y representantes de Chile en M√©xico (in Spanish) In 1844, Mexico opened a consulate in Valpara√≠so. In 1864, during the Second French intervention in Mexico, Chile recognized and maintained diplomatic relations with the government of President Benito Ju√°rez.Bilateral agreements between Mexico and Chile (in Spanish) In the early 1900s, both nations established resident embassies in each other's capitals respectively. In 1914, Chile belonged to regional group called the ABC nations (which also included Argentina and Brazil). These three nations made up the richest and most influential nations in South America at the time. That year, the ABC nations intervened in a diplomatic dispute between the United States and Mexico who were on verge of war over the Tampico Affair and the subsequent occupation of Veracruz by US forces. The ABC nations meet with representatives of the United States and Mexico in Niagara Falls, Canada to ease the tension between the two nations and to avoid war, which afterwards did not occur. In 1960, President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos became the first Mexican head-of-state to pay a visit to Chile. In 1972, President Salvador Allende paid a visit to Mexico. On 11 November 1974, Mexican President Luis Echeverr√≠a √Ålvarez severed diplomatic relations with Chile a year after the unconstitutional removal and death of elected President Salvador Allende by General Augusto Pinochet.Mexico breaks diplomatic relations with Chile (in Spanish) For the next fifteen years, Mexico would receive thousands of Chilean refugees who fled the dictatorship of Pinochet.Reconoce Chile la solidaridad de M√©xico al abrir las puertas a miles de exiliados Both nations re-established diplomatic relations on 23 March 1990.

At the moment ‚Äì assistant of the head coach in the club Avanhard Kramatorsk. Oleksandr has an older brother Valeriy Ivashchenko who also is former football player and now coach. Club career Oleksandr is a pupil of the ¬´Dynamo¬ª football school in Kiev. At the professional level in the ¬´Dynamo¬ª\`s teams, he has been played only 2 games in 2002 as a part of the third club team that competed in the second league of the Ukrainian championship. In 2005, Ivashchenko contracted with the Kiev team \\"Obolon Kyiv\\", acted as the main team in the matches of the first league, as well as for the second club team in the second league. At the end of the season 2004/05 he played in two games in the High League. Interestingly ‚Äì all official documents say that Oleksandr Ivashchenko debuted in the upper division on March 5, 2006, against the FC \\"Metalurh\\" (Zaporizhya) (defeat 1:2) in the team FC \\"Kryvbas\\" (Kryvyi Rih), which Oleksandr moved to on early 2006. In fact, this happened on May 28, 2005, at the 70-th minute of the match, in which \\"Obolon\\" (Kyiv) played against FC \\"Borysfen\\" (Boryspil), which took place in the 28 rounds. This collision is due to the fact that in the start protocol, in the column \\"name\\", instead of \\"Oleksandr\\" was entered \\"Valeriy\\". This mistake was quite serious, as in \\"Obolon\\" at the same time played Oleksandr Ivashchenko's brother ‚Äì Valeriy Ivashchenko. Due to the same mistake in the register of \\"played games in the High League,\\" Oleksandr does not have more than 29 minutes of the match, in which \\"Obolon\\" played with the FC Metalurh (Donetsk). This confrontation took place on June 16 at the capital's Bannikov Stadium. In the winter of 2006, Oleksandr Ivashchenko switched to the FC \\"Kryvbas\\": Oleksandr Kosevych, the head coach of the club from the High division, drew attention to the player who managed to score six goals in 17 games for the first half of the season in the First League. It must be noted, that Ivashchenko was not confused and for 2,5 seasons played 37 games at the highest national level, scoring five goals. These figures could have been better, but –û–ª–µ–≥ –¢–∞—Ä–∞–Ω, who began training FC \\"Kryvbas\\" since February 2007, had his own specific thoughts about the role of Ivashchenko in the team. As a result, Oleksandr spent the 2008/09 season playing on lease rights outside Kryvyi Rih. At first, it was Illichivets, and then ‚Äì Arsenal Kyiv. In the summer of 2009, Ivashchenko became a player already familiar with \\"Obolon\\", which became a participant in the Ukrainian Premier League. But in Kiev he played only the one season: Yuriy Maksymov, who was the coach of \\"Obolon\\" until December 31, 2009, and from January 1, headed FC \\"Kryvbas\\", in the summer of 2010 invited Oleksandr to his team. The first season became for Ivashchenko the brightest: he struck the seven times the opponents' gate in 26 matches. This figure became the best in FC \\"Kryvbas\\" in that season. In the future, his affairs in FC \\"Kryvbas\\" were not very good. At first, the severe injury that Ivashchenko got at the end of 2011 made itself felt, and then, after a month of rehabilitation, a new trainer appeared in the FC \\"Kryvbas\\", who bet on leased players from the FC Dnipro. After FC \\"Kryvbas\\" was declared bankrupt, in the summer of 2013, Oleksandr switched to the \\"new-old\\" FC \\"Obolon-Brovar\\". Having played for this club half season, in February 2014, he went into the ranks of the first-ranking FC \\"Oleksandriya\\": Volodymyr Sharan drew attention to the fact that Ivashchenko, despite all the hardships, did not lose the ability to score goals (Oleksandr scored 8 in 15 games for FC \\"Obolon-Brovar\\"). In the second part of the season 2013/14 he scored 4 goals in 9 games. The next season, Ivashchenko became the champion of the First League in the FC \\"Oleksandriya\\". With this club, he also had to play in the Premier League, but he received a slight damage during the preseason gathering, which had to be cured within one month. However, Sharan did not wait, and the new contract with Oleksandr Ivashchenko was not signed. In August 2015, Oleksandr signed a six-month contract with an ambitious FC \\"Desna\\" (Chernihiv) for which he played nine matches. In March 2016, he signed a contract with FC \\"Obolon-Brovar\\" until the end of the 2015/16 season. After completing the contract, Ivashchenko supported a form of sport according to an individual schedule, hoping to find a new professional club in the winter transfer window. In February 2017, he became a player of the FC \\"Avanhard\\" ‚Äì a team that is currently playing in the First League of Ukraine. Oleksandr explained his choice by the fact that this collective is coached by Oleksandr Kosevych whom he knows in joint work in FC \\"Kryvbas\\". In the summer of 2018, Ivashchenko finally decided that this year will be the last in his professional career. In the last, in the status of a professional player he came out on the field on October 20: 17 minutes was played in the match FC \\"Avanhard\\" ‚Äì FC \\"Balkany\\" (Zorya), which was held in Kramatorsk. At the end of January 2019, Oleksandr Ivashchenko officially entered the trainer's headquarters of the FC \\"Avanhard\\".

Helsinki Swimming Stadium is an outdoor swimming venue in Helsinki, Finland, located in the El√§intarha area to the northeast of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. History The Swimming Stadium was designed by architect Jorma J√§rvi in the Functionalist style prevalent during the 1930s. The stadium was built for the 1940 Olympic Games which were cancelled due to World War II, but later hosted the 1952 Summer Olympics. Because of the war, the construction of the Swimming Stadium took a long time, and it was finally completed in 1947. In wartime, the finished pools were used to store herring and root vegetables. According to the International Swimming Federation, the water temperature in the pool needs to be at least 22 ¬∞C, nowadays 27 ¬∞C. The machinery to heat the outdoor pool was ordered from abroad, and the ship transporting them was sunk immediately after the war broke out. The stadium has been listed as a significant example of modern architecture in Finland by Docomomo. Current use The Swimming Stadium is a popular recreational venue for citizens. It is open from the beginning of May to the end of September. It is a popular place and in summertime it is visited by about 5,000 swimmers every day ‚Äì 290,000 altogether in summer 2013. The stadium has three pools: a 50-metre exercise swimming pool, a diving pool and a children's pool, and a small, shallow, round wading pool for small children a little further away. The diving pool has two 1 metre and two 3 metre high springboards, and a 1-metre plateau in front of the diving tower. Use of the diving tower is controlled and requires lifeguard supervision. The 1 and 3 metre springboards are almost always freely usable by customers. However, for example when swimming teams or clubs come to practice at the Stadium, the 3 metre springboard may be reserved for their use. The area also has a water slide, a gym, a basketball field, a volleyball field, a table tennis table and a caf√©. The gym is open all year round. Outside normal opening times, the Stadium is used a practicing place for other aquatic sports, for example diving schools use the diving pool as practice place. The Swimming Stadium was also the scene for filming the popular Finnish youth television show Summeri in 2003‚Äì2009 and 2011. In January 2009, the city of Helsinki initiated a discussion of keeping the Helsinki Swimming Stadium heated throughout the entire autumn and winter, in order to make it accessible for outdoor swimming during the entire year, in honour of the 90th anniversary of the Sports Bureau of Helsinki. However, this idea was abandoned as too expensive. See also * Kumpula Outdoor Swimming Pool References *1952 Summer Olympics official report. pp. 47‚Äì9.

Exit rows may be next to overwing exits or full-sized exit doors. Passenger criteria Since passengers seated in an exit row must be able and willing to assist the crew during an evacuation of the aircraft, civil aviation boards and national governments set specific requirements for passengers seated in an exit row. While exact requirements vary by country and airline, frequently exit row passengers must: *Be of a certain minimum age, ranging from 12 to 18 depending on the airline's policies and/or local law. *Not be traveling with anyone requiring special assistance in an emergency (such as an infant or person with a disability), or an animal (including service animals) *Have no physical or mental impairment that would hinder quickly reaching and operating the emergency exit. *Speak and read the national language of the airline's home country (e.g. English on Qantas or German on Lufthansa, etc.) *Not use a seatbelt extension. *Be able to lift 27 kg/60 lb (for window exits only).http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/seat-selection/global/en#exit- row-seats Some carriers require passengers with an exit row seat assignment to check in with an agent (as opposed to online or at a kiosk), who will manually verify eligibility and issue a boarding pass.http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/seat-selection- conditions/global/en#exitrowhttps://airnzau.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3015/~/who- can-book-exit-row-seats%3F Comfort and Premium Factor Most exit row seats provide a few more inches of seat pitch compared to non-exit row seats so that passengers have more space to access the exit. Seats one row in front of an exit row usually are not able to recline, which can limit their comfort on longer flights. Nonetheless, airlines have taken advantage of this extra space by reserving exit row seats for frequent fliers or charging fees for booking them. A few airlines have gone to branding exit row seats as a premium economy product - on Virgin America's A320, the exit rows (as well as bulkhead seats) are considered \\"Main Cabin Select\\" where meals, alcohol, pay-per-view movies and a higher baggage allowance are all included. Main Cabin Select is sold as a separate class of service between coach and first class, and a restrictive MCS fare tends to be equivalent to a full-fare economy ticket. Similarly, JetBlue uses the exit rows as part of their \\"Even More Space\\" section. Kinds of Exit Rows Typically, there are two kinds of exit rows in which passengers may be seated. There is the exit row next to overwing exits which are typically not attended to by flight attendants and require passengers to operate them in the event of an emergency. The second type of exit row is next to a full-sized exit door and a flight attendant is seated in these rows. The flight attendant typically sits on a jumpseat.

At the time, Algeria was a governorate of France, but with the exception of European settlers, Algerians were not accorded civil rights. He quickly became active in politics, and joined Messali Hadj's Parti du peuple alg√©rien (PPA) leftist nationalist movement in 1939.

Formerly developed by Naughty Dog from 1996 to 1999, by Traveller's Tales, Eurocom and Vicarious Visions from 2000 to 2004, and by Radical Entertainment from 2005 to 2008, the series is currently published by Activision. The series features a large cast of distinctive characters designed by numerous different artists, which include Charles Zembillas and Joe Pearson. It also features a cast of veteran voice actors. The series centers on the conflicts between a mutated bandicoot named Crash Bandicoot and his creator, Doctor Neo Cortex. Crash acts as the main playable character of the series, though other characters have had occasional player access, such as Coco Bandicoot and Doctor Neo Cortex, as well as Crunch Bandicoot. Protagonists Crash Bandicoot Crash Bandicoot is the title character and main protagonist of the Crash Bandicoot series. Introduced in the 1996 video game Crash Bandicoot, Crash is a mutant eastern barred bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the series' main antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and soon escaped from Cortex's castle after a failed experiment in the \\"Cortex Vortex\\". Throughout the series, Crash acts as the opposition against Cortex and his schemes for world domination. While Crash has a number of offensive maneuvers at his disposal, his most distinctive technique is one in which he spins like a tornado at high speeds and knocks away almost anything that he strikes. Crash was created by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin, and was originally designed by Charles Zembillas. Crash was intended to be a mascot character for Sony to use to compete against Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog and Nintendo's Mario. Before Crash was given his name (which stems from the visceral reaction to the character's destruction of boxes), he was referred to as \\"Willie the Wombat\\" for much of the duration of the first game's production. Crash has drawn comparisons to Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog by reviewers. His animations have been praised, while his voice has faced criticism. His redesign in the Radical Entertainment games has drawn mixed reactions. Aku Aku Aku Aku is the guardian of the Wumpa Islands and the father figure of Crash Bandicoot, Coco and his friends. Aku Aku is the spirit of an ancient witch doctor encased in a floating, wooden mask. During Crash's missions to stop Doctor Cortex, he scattered copies of himself throughout the travels in an effort to aid him in his mission. Whenever Crash possesses an Aku Aku mask, he will be shielded from one enemy attack or contact. Collecting three Aku Aku masks gives Crash temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers, but does not protect from falling down holes. In his English speaking appearances, he was voiced by David Siller in the first and second games, Mel Winkler from Crash Bandicoot: Warped to Crash Twinsanity, and Greg Eagles from Crash of the Titans onwards. In the first game and Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, he is a background character that helps Crash. He begins to play a major series role from Crash Bandicoot: Warped, in which his evil twin brother Uka Uka is introduced when the ruins of Cortex's space station crash into Earth and set Uka Uka free so Aku Aku tells Crash and Coco Bandicoot the story of how he locked Uka Uka up in an underground prison many eons ago. He then gives the two the assignment of gathering Crystals that lay scattered throughout time and keep them from the hands of Uka Uka and Doctor Cortex. During Crash's final fight against Doctor Neo Cortex, Aku Aku fends off Uka Uka's attacks while the fight is in session. Aku Aku appears in Crash Team Racing as a tutor for Crash, Coco, Polar and Pura, giving them useful tips and tricks throughout the game. He also appears as a power-up during the races, protecting the said characters (along with Penta Penguin) from all attacks and obstacles while giving them a speed boost. However, he cannot protect the characters from chasms and deep water. In Crash Bash, in order to resolve his constant fighting with Uka Uka, Aku Aku summons Crash and Coco as part of a contest between his players against Uka Uka. Aku Aku is later allowed to have Tiny and Dingodile into his team as to even out the number of players between them. During the course of the tournament, Aku Aku begins to suspect that Uka Uka is using the tournament to disguise a secret plot of his own. He discovers this plot to steal Crystals just in time for his team to win. Aku Aku locks the Crystals up into a secret cabinet for safekeeping, and banishes Uka Uka into the vacuum of space as punishment for trying to abuse the power of the Crystals. When disasters ravage the world in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, Aku Aku discovers that Uka Uka and Doctor Cortex have unleashed a group of destructive masks known as the Elementals, and calls upon Crash and Coco to gather Crystals and return the Elementals to their hibernation state. In Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, Aku Aku saves Crash from being kidnapped by Nefarious Tropy and N. Trance, and sends him off to gather Crystals so that he may be able to reach the villains. Aku Aku reprises his role from Crash Team Racing in Crash Nitro Kart, giving useful advice and acting as a power-up for the characters Crash, Coco and Crunch. In Crash Twinsanity, Aku Aku convinces Uka Uka to join him in order to defeat the Evil Twins, but both are easily defeated when they attempt this. Aku Aku has a cameo appearance in Crash Tag Team Racing as the tiki masks in the \\"Tiki Turbo\\" track. He also appears as the tutor in Crash Boom Bang!, giving the player instructions on how to play the game. In Crash of the Titans, Aku Aku is captured by Doctor Neo Cortex, but is rescued by Crash Bandicoot. Throughout the game, Aku Aku gives the player basic instructions, shields Crash from enemy attacks, and transforms into a skateboard to help Crash traverse slippery terrain. He reprises this role for Crash: Mind over Mutant. Aku Aku is one of the only two characters in the game unable to be controlled by Cortex's NV device, as the device is too small to fit on his head. A reviewer for Game Revolution compared the mechanics of the Aku Aku masks to the shields of the Sonic the Hedgehog series. John Scalzo of Gaming Target commented that the \\"booooo-ahhhhhh!‚Äù chant made by Aku Aku is \\"pretty slick\\". The sound quality of Aku Aku's voice in Crash Team Racing was praised by SolidSnake of PSX Extreme, while Arnold Katayev, in his review of Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, negatively described Aku Aku's voice as \\"melodramatic\\". Steven Rodriguez, in his Nintendo World Report review of Crash Nitro Kart, described Aku Aku's voice when giving advice between races as \\"sexy\\" and cited it as the best part of the game's audio, but admitted that \\"even he gets rather annoying.\\" In his review of Crash of the Titans, Brian Rowe of Game Revolution, while citing the ability to \\"slap Aku Aku‚Äôs face into the ground and ride it like a surfboard\\" as \\"harshly inconsiderate\\", considered it \\"payback for his gratingly poor impersonations of that other floating head of wisdom ‚Äì Frylock.\\" Coco Bandicoot Coco Bandicoot is the younger sister of Crash Bandicoot. Just as her older brother, she was genetically engineered through the use of Doctor Neo Cortex's and Doctor Nitrus Brio's Evolvo-Ray. Contrasting Crash, however, Coco was made highly intelligent, and her intelligence quotient is said to be as much as 164. Like her brother, Coco has a heroic personality and a fearless nature, as she is willing to take any chance to help her family save the world from evil, unafraid of making mistakes. She is a fan of martial arts films, wrestling and NASCAR. She is also shown to be a skilled scooter rider, using this talent to outrace a Japanese tsunami on one occasion. Coco was designed by Charles Zembillas and Naughty Dog as a counterbalance to Tawna (Crash's girlfriend in the first game) that would appease Sony Computer Entertainment Japan, who were not comfortable with a \\"super sexy\\" character being alongside Crash. Charles Zembillas' first sketches of Coco were drawn on March 18, 1997, when Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back was in development. She is voiced by Vicki Winters in Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, Hynden Walch in Crash Team Racing, Debi Derryberry from Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex to Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, Tara Strong in the third season of Skylanders Academy, and Eden Riegel in Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. Coco made her debut in Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, living on N. Sanity Island with Crash. One day, when the battery for her laptop runs out, she sends Crash off to find a replacement battery for her. When Coco discovers that Crash is gathering Crystals for Cortex, she becomes suspicious of Cortex and decides to hack into Cortex's computer to find what he is really up to. What she finds are \\"detailed schematics for an improved Cortex Vortex and a suspicious looking space station\\". She learns of Cortex's real plan just as Crash has gathered all the Crystals, and reveals Cortex's intentions to Crash before he can give the Crystals to Cortex. After Cortex's plan is foiled, Coco is called upon by Aku Aku in Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped to use Doctor Nefarious Tropy's Time-Twisting Machine and gather the powerful Crystals in their original places before Cortex does so. Coco helps by gathering the Crystals in 17th-century Imperial China, the 18th-century Pacific Ocean, and World War I Europe. She is also responsible for the defeat of Cortex's right-hand man Doctor N. Gin on the Moon, with her new pet tiger Pura assisting her. Coco is a playable character in Crash Team Racing and Crash Bash. The epilogue of Crash Team Racing states that Coco opened up her own internet dating service after the events of the game (an online game streaming service in the Nitro- Fueled remake). When the Elementals wreak havoc on the Earth in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, Coco activates a new Portal Chamber for Crash to use. She helps Crash gather the Power Crystals needed to stop the Elementals by collecting them in a tsunami-ravaged China and an avalanche zone. She also stops an armada of Cortex's space stations from striking Earth. Near the end, she helps Crash and Crunch escape from Cortex's malfunctioning space station. In Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, Coco is abducted by N. Trance and is brainwashed alongside Crunch and Fake Crash. Coco battles Crash in a large battleship inside an active volcano, with Crash attacking the craft while it is reloading its weaponry. Upon snapping out of N. Trance's control, Coco becomes a playable character, gathering two Crystals in space while escaping the wrath of a fireball created by N. Tropy. Coco is a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart as well. In one cutscene, she uses her hacking skills to put the hyperactive Nash to sleep. In Crash Twinsanity, a teenage Coco is ambushed by Doctor Neo Cortex, who disguises himself as her in order to lure Crash into a trap so he can finally destroy him. Many moments later, Coco believes that Cortex kidnapped Crash, and travels to the Iceberg Lab to confront him. With a swift kick, she attacks Cortex and sends the Power Crystals he was holding flying into the Psychetron. The resulting chain reaction leaves Coco paralyzed until the end of the game. In Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage, Coco teams up with the Professor to track down Ripto and Doctor Cortex. Later in the game, they're both kidnapped by Doctor Cortex's niece, Nina Cortex, who keeps them locked up in cages. After being freed from her cage, Coco suggests that Crash and Spyro put a tracer on Cortex and Ripto as to allow the heroes to track the villains back to their hideout. Coco's last major contribution to the story is constructing a portal to Cortex's and Ripto's lair. Coco is a playable character in Crash Tag Team Racing. In the game's story, Coco discovers the sole clue to whoever stole MotorWorld's Power Gems, which is Wumpa Whip. Because of Crash's high consumption of the beverage, she briefly believes (along with the others) that Crash is the culprit, despite the fact that Willie Wumpa Cheeks is the park's lone source of Wumpa Whip. At the end of the game, Coco returns the park's deed to Von Clutch, to whom it belongs. Coco plays a central role in Crash Boom Bang!, in which she is invited by the Viscount to the World Cannonball Race in his search for the Super Big Power Crystal. In Crash of the Titans, Coco is on the verge of creating a device that will be able to recycle butter when she is captured along with Aku Aku by Doctor Neo Cortex. When Nina replaces Cortex, Coco is brainwashed and is forced to finish the Doominator. She ends up completing the Doominator, but is rescued by Crash and is able to stop it at the end of the game. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, she appears as a vendor selling upgrades for Crash's abilities. Coco is a playable character in the cooperation mode of the Wii and Xbox 360 versions of Crash: Mind over Mutant. At the beginning of the game, Coco converts the Doominator's eye into an entertainment system. After seeing an infomercial advertising the \\"NV\\", a do-anything personal digital assistant, she receives an NV along with Crunch and quickly becomes addicted. Soon enough, the NV, which Dr. N. Brio filled with negative Mojo, transforms her into a ferocious beast who tries to kill Crash using a giant basketball-launching machine. After being defeated and informed (to her disappointment) that the NV had a negative influence on her, she uses the Doominator's eye to access Cortex's blog and learn what Cortex is planning. She is accessible as the second player's character from that point on. Coco's availability as a playable character in Crash: Mind over Mutant was omitted from the PlayStation 2 version of the game due to her distinct animations taking up much of the console's memory. In the PlayStation 2 version, she is replaced by a white-furred version of her brother named \\"Carbon Crash\\". Coco has been featured in two series of Crash Bandicoot action figures produced by the now-defunct Resaurus. For Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, Resaurus produced a Coco Bandicoot figure bundled with figures of a penguin and lizard from the game. The Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped series featured two different figures of Coco, including one bundled with Aku Aku and Crash Bandicoot figures. Coco's inclusion and incorporation as a playable character in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex was met with a generally lukewarm response among critics. Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt that Coco was a \\"less powerful\\" and \\"less enjoyable\\" character than Crash and that \\"she was just not fun the way Crash is\\". On the subject, Hilary added that \\"Crash is a silly creature to look at. He's almost absurd, which works great with his various animations. Coco isn't really silly at all. The game isn't called Crash and Coco so why must I be forced to play her? Rather than add variety, Coco detracts from the only real selling point of the game ‚Äì Crash Bandicoot.\\" Matthew Gallant of GameSpot noted that \\"When you play a level as Coco instead of Crash, there's no explanation or warning given ‚Äì you'll simply enter the level's portal as Crash and come out the other end as Coco. It's not all bad, but compared with Super Mario Sunshine, it seems very uneven.\\" Debi Derryberry's voice acting as Coco has garnered mixed reviews in the series as a whole. Arnold Katayev of PSX Extreme was positive about her voice in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, while Matt Keller of PALGN felt that her voice in Crash of the Titans was \\"annoying\\". Crunch Bandicoot Crunch Bandicoot is a genetically altered bandicoot created by Doctor Cortex to destroy Crash Bandicoot. After his defeat, Crunch had a change of heart and now tries to be a positive role model to children. Crunch also protects Crash and Coco from harm. He is voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex and Crash Nitro Kart, Chris Williams in the Radical Entertainment games, and Ike Amadi in Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled. Crunch appears as a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart Crash Tag Team Racing and Crash Boom Bang!. Tawna Bandicoot Tawna Bandicoot is Crash's ex-girlfriend. She made her debut on the first Crash Bandicoot game, being trapped for observation on Neo Cortex's castle after being experimented on. Crash then invades Cortex's castle, defeats him and saves her. The marketing director of Universal Interactive Studios objected to Tawna's initial design on \\"basic sexist principles\\". An alternate version of Tawna is a playable character in Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. She is originally from a dimension known as the ‚ÄúTawnaverse‚Äù, where she is the protagonist of her home universe instead of Crash. She is voiced by Akiko Toda in Crash Boom Bang!, Debi Derryberry in the N. Sane Trilogy, Misty Lee in Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled and Ursula Taherian in Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. Antagonists Doctor Neo Cortex Doctor Neo Cortex is a fictional character and the main antagonist of the Crash Bandicoot series. His name is a play on the term neocortex, an area of the brain. He has been the archenemy of Crash Bandicoot ever since his first appearance, in the game Crash Bandicoot. In the series, Cortex is depicted as a mad scientist who seeks to achieve world domination as an act of vengeance for the ridicule he has suffered in the past. He is aided by the wicked Tiki mask Uka Uka, who gives him advice on how to achieve this goal. Under his guidance, Doctor Cortex mutated the local animals into his soldiers, eventually creating Crash Bandicoot, the titular character of the series, but soon rejects him as unworthy of being in his army and removes him from his castle. As Cortex's actions endanger the sanctity of the islands the games are set in, Cortex's plans for world domination are often hampered by Crash along with other characters. Crash's constant interference has made eliminating Crash one of Cortex's top priorities along with world domination. Cortex was created by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin, and was originally designed by Charles Zembillas. Critical reception of Cortex has been mostly positive, with much of the praise going to Clancy Brown's and Lex Lang's vocal performances, as well as the character's portrayal in Crash Twinsanity. Doctor N. Gin Doctor N. Gin (spelled N-Gin in the Radical Entertainment games) was the right-hand man of Doctor Neo Cortex, replacing Doctor Nitrus Brio after Crash Bandicoot. He has since been replaced by the person he succeeded, Nitrus Brio. He is voiced by Brendan O'Brien in the Naughty Dog games, by Corey Burton in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, by Quinton Flynn in Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Twinsanity, and by Nolan North in the Radical Entertainment games. His name is a play on the word \\"engine\\", and his first name has never been revealed. As a child, N. Gin was a classmate of Neo Cortex and Nitrus Brio in Madame Amberley's Academy of Evil. After working at a stapler factory for a time, N. Gin went on to become a world-renowned physicist in the defense industry. However, due to a budget cut, one of his missile projects ended up faulty and, as a result, went awry, lodging itself into N. Gin's head. With his intellect, N. Gin was able to stabilize the weapon and reconstruct it as a life support system at the cost of his sanity. Because the missile is still live, it activates whenever N. Gin is stressed or angry, leaving him with a large headache (a trait inspired by creator Jason Rubin's own chronic migraine headaches). Shortly after the missile incident, Doctor N. Gin was taken in by Doctor Neo Cortex to replace the double-crossed Doctor Nitrus Brio. Studying a large Crystal found by Cortex after his defeat by Crash Bandicoot, N. Gin discovers that 25 smaller \\"Slave Crystals\\" are needed alongside this \\"Master Crystal\\" in order to power Cortex's new \\"Cortex Vortex\\" device. When Crash is ordered by Doctor Cortex to give the Crystals he has gathered to N. Gin, N. Gin attempts to take the Crystals by force, only to be sent spiraling into the vacuum of space when Crash destroys his prized mecha. After the destruction of this mecha, N. Gin constructed a superior model: a suit of mobile armor that could transform into a space fighter and dock with a huge weapon platform. N. Gin uses this machine to confront Coco Bandicoot on the Moon in Crash Bandicoot: Warped, only to fail once again. N. Gin appears as a playable character in \\"Crash Team Racing\\" and as an obstacle in a \\"Ballistix\\" level in \\"Crash Bash\\". The epilogue of Crash Team Racing states that N. Gin opened a custom auto parts store in Toledo, Ohio, only to have it close down after a massive recall due to the damage caused by his patented \\"Clear-the-Road\\" missile system. In the Nitro-Fueled remake, his liking for flair and destruction then netted him a job as a commentator on a robot fighting channel after that. In Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, N. Gin is an attendee of Uka Uka's bad guy convention, and is ultimately the one who reveals the secret of Crunch Bandicoot, Cortex's new superweapon. For the rest of the game, N. Gin serves as an obstacle in some of the levels. In Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure, N. Gin battles Crash in the skies with a weapon platform similar to the one he piloted in Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. He is later merged with Doctor Cortex, Tiny and Dingodile, and becomes Mega-Mix. After chasing Crash down a space station hall, Mega-Mix is left inside the space station, which explodes with the villains in it. N. Gin is a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart. In one cutscene, N. Gin considers creating cybernetic sharks as new henchmen after racing Nash. In Crash Twinsanity, N. Gin appears during the first boss battle, piloting the Mecha-Bandicoot in an attempt to eliminate Crash. When all of its weapons are destroyed, the Mecha- Bandicoot stomps a hole into the floor and falls into a cavern. N. Gin is later seen as the captain of his own battleship. At the crow's nest, N. Gin tries to destroy Crash with a barrage of missiles, occasionally tossing a TNT Crate. This leads to the eventual collapse of the crow's nest, causing N. Gin to land on his head onto a pile of TNT Crates, creating a large explosion that sinks the battleship. N. Gin is last seen teamed up with N. Tropy and N. Brio, with all of them trying to steal the Evil Twins' riches. However, they are driven out by Spyro the Dragon. N. Gin is a playable character in Crash Tag Team Racing. In the game's story, N. Gin convinces Neo Cortex to join in the search for Von Clutch's missing Power Gems so that he can use Von Clutch's theme park as a new base of operations (although Cortex later claims the idea as his own). He has a cameo appearance in the \\"Silhouette Quiz\\" minigame in Crash Boom Bang!. In Crash of the Titans, N. Gin opposes Doctor Cortex's replacement by praising Cortex's stationery. N. Gin is next seen in his weapons factory, which appears on the outside as a version of the Statue of Liberty modelled after N. Gin. This factory constantly bombards the surrounding area with all kinds of explosives in an attempt to hinder Crash. Inside the factory, N. Gin communicates to his workers through the factory intercom, making announcements, singing inspirational songs, or alerting the workers of Crash's presence. In the factory's crown, N. Gin spends his days performing on his enormous pipe organ. When confronted by Crash and Aku Aku, N. Gin indirectly reveals to them that he has mixed feelings over Cortex's replacement to Nina. One side likes Doctor Cortex and the abuse he brings to him and wishes for his return, while another side approves of Nina's new way of doing things, believing that she is a more efficient leader than Cortex. Eventually, the two sides reach a compromise, and tell Crash of Uka Uka's whereabouts in hopes that he will also free Cortex, planning to shower them with doom later on. In Crash: Mind over Mutant, N. Gin leads an attack on Crash Bandicoot when Coco and Crunch become addicted to Cortex's and Brio's personal digital assistant, fleeing to a small observatory on Wumpa Island afterwards. When Crash and Aku Aku catch up to him, N. Gin reveals that ever since Doctor Cortex escaped the Doominator, he has been secretly watching the Bandicoot family and collecting information on them, hoping to be rewarded with the ownership of Wumpa Island if Cortex is triumphant in his current plot. After Crash fends off N. Gin's army of Ratnicians, N. Gin is sternly told by Aku Aku to leave the island, to which N. Gin reluctantly complies. Tiny Tiger Tiny Tiger (erroneously named Taz Tiger in the pause screen of the North American version of Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back) is a thylacine (Siberian tiger in Crash of the Titans) minion of Doctor Neo Cortex. He is voiced by Brendan O'Brien in the PlayStation games, by John DiMaggio in Crash Nitro Kart, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and Crash Team Racing Nitro- Fueled, by Chris Williams in the Radical Entertainment games, and by Nolan North in the Nintendo DS version of Crash of the Titans. It is implied in at least two instruction manuals that Tiny was Doctor Cortex's first foray into genetic alteration. However, this conflicts with what was established by Naughty Dog, who confirmed that Ripper Roo was Cortex's first serious creation. Following the orders of Doctor Nitrus Brio, Tiny attempts to eliminate Crash as the third boss of Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, but is unsuccessful in the end. By Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped, Tiny has joined forces with Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka. His first duty working under Cortex is attempting to take whatever Crystals Crash and Coco have gathered and bringing them to Cortex in the Colosseum. Tiny is once again unsuccessful, as a fight against Crash in the Colosseum proves fruitless. Tiny appears as a playable character in Crash Team Racing and Crash Bash. The epilogue of Crash Team Racing states that Tiny moved to Beverly Hills and founded a chain of fitness clubs after the events of the game, his exercise videos being particularly successful. In the Nitro-Fueled remake, he instead posted his exercise videos online before starting his fitness club chain, where he also sold his own brand of lemongrass and avocado protein supplements. In Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, Tiny is an attendee in Uka Uka's bad guy convention, not speaking a single line in the entire game. He later serves as an obstacle in certain levels, literally standing in Crash's way in an attempt to hinder him, as well as operating various flying vehicles in levels involving planes or spaceships. In Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure, Tiny serves as the third boss, fighting Crash near a large waterfall. He is later merged with Doctor Cortex, N. Gin, and Dingodile, and becomes Mega-Mix. After chasing Crash down a space station hall, Mega-Mix is left inside the space station, which explodes with the villains in it. Tiny is a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart. In the game's story, Tiny is seen playing checkers with himself (and later, attempting to assist N. Gin) when the tower the villains are standing in is abducted. When Emperor Velo is defeated, Tiny, Cortex, and N. Gin are teleported to Terra, where Tiny gains the respect of the inhabitants. Tiny has a cameo appearance (along with other Crash villains) in Crash Twinsanity during Crash's \\"birthday party\\". In the crossover game Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage, Tiny acts as the second boss, attempting to obliterate Crash in a frozen tundra with a tank. Tiny has a cameo appearance in Crash Boom Bang!, appearing in the \\"Silhouette Quiz\\" minigame. In Crash of the Titans, Tiny protests Neo Cortex's replacement alongside Doctor N. Gin by praising Cortex's stationery. Tiny is the one in charge of the mining operations seen in Episodes 5 through 7, responsible for destroying a portion of the jungle and obtaining minerals from the volcano. When Crash disrupts these operations, Tiny confronts Crash directly and voices his displeasure in both Crash's antics and the fact that he wasn't invited to Crash Tag Team Racing. When Crash confronts Tiny with the Shellephant, Tiny decides to reveal the whereabouts of Crash's sister; he is also the one who reveals that Uka Uka replaced Cortex for Nina. Although Tiny isn't seen physically in Crash: Mind over Mutant, his voice can be heard in the game's credits when he tries to correct Crunch when he mixes up his metaphors. Uka Uka Uka Uka is the evil younger twin brother of Aku Aku. Uka Uka was created by Naughty Dog as a presence that was able to cause even Neo Cortex to cower in fear. He was voiced by Clancy Brown from 1998 to 2003, by Alex Fernandez in Crash Twinsanity and Skylanders: Imaginators, and by John DiMaggio in Crash of the Titans, Crash: Mind over Mutant, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled. Uka Uka first appears in Crash Bandicoot: Warped, where he shares the role of main antagonist with Doctor Cortex. Several eons before the events of the series, he was locked away by Aku Aku in an underground prison due to his malevolent nature. Several millennia after his incarceration, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Cortex to fulfill his desire to enslave humanity, only to have Cortex lose the Crystals and the Gems, and have his space station destroyed. The rubble of the ruined space station eventually crash-lands onto Earth, destroying the underground prison, and finally freeing Uka Uka. Upset with Cortex's failure to retrieve the Crystals and the Gems, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Nefarious Tropy, who has created the Time Twister, which will allow them to collect the Crystals and the Gems in their original places. And, since Cortex's failure also managed to set him free after so many years of imprisonment, Uka Uka still felt a sense of gratitude and generosity. When Crash intervenes and destroys the Time Twister, Uka Uka is trapped inside a time prison with Doctor Cortex and N. Tropy, who have been turned into infants. Uka Uka appears in Crash Team Racing as a tutor for the characters Cortex, N. Gin, Tiny, and Dingodile, giving them useful tips and tricks throughout the game. He also appears as a power-up during the races, protecting the said characters (along with Ripper Roo, Papu Papu, Komodo Joe, Pinstripe Potoroo, Fake Crash, Doctor Nefarious Tropy and, through hacking, Nitros Oxide) from all attacks and obstacles while giving them a speed boost. However, he cannot protect the characters from chasms and deep water. In Crash Bash, in order to resolve his constant fighting with Aku Aku, Uka Uka summons Cortex, Brio, Tiny, Dingodile, Koala Kong, and Rilla Roo as part of a contest between his players against Aku Aku. Uka Uka is later forced to relinquish Tiny and Dingodile to Aku Aku's team to even out the number of players between them. In Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, Uka Uka scolds Doctor Cortex and the rest of the villains for their less-than-impressive evil productivity. Fed up with Cortex's incompetence, Uka Uka concludes that if global domination is to ever be achieved, Crash should be handled with personally. Deciding to use Cortex's new super-weapon to wipe out Crash Bandicoot, he revives the Elementals to act as the super-weapon's source of power and bring it to life. When Crash imprisons the Elementals, defeats the super-weapon, and brings it to their side, Uka Uka holds Cortex responsible and fires an energy blast at him out of anger, but in doing so causes their newly built space station to overload, forcing Cortex and Uka Uka to evacuate. Their escape pod lands in the depths of Antarctica, stranding them both on a sheet of ice. Uka Uka oversees the evil plots of both Neo Cortex and Nefarious Tropy in Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure and Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced respectively, becoming annoyed when both of them fail. Uka Uka reprises his role from Crash Team Racing in Crash Nitro Kart, giving useful advice and acting as a power-up for the characters Neo Cortex, N. Gin, Tiny Tiger and N. Tropy. In Crash Twinsanity, Uka Uka is freed from a wall of ice, but is enraged to see that Cortex has teamed up with Crash in order to defeat the Evil Twins, and transforms into an Ice Titan in order to kill both of them, considering that he still held a grudge against Cortex for his past failures. When he is defeated, Uka Uka attempts to flee, but Aku Aku stops him and tells him about the Evil Twins' plot to destroy the Earth. Opposed to the fact that someone else is trying to destroy the world (a job that he believes is his), Uka Uka temporarily teams up with his twin brother, only to be defeated alongside him by the Evil Twins' ability to warp reality. Uka Uka has a cameo appearance in Crash Boom Bang! as a purchaseable power-up. In Crash of the Titans, Uka Uka teaches Doctor Cortex a new process called \\"Mojo mutations\\", which uses a magical substance known as Mojo to mutate any living creature into a loyal minion of Cortex. At the Temple of Zoom, Uka Uka leaves Doctor Cortex to destroy Crash and Aku Aku while he returns to the base with an enormous amount of stolen Mojo and Coco Bandicoot at tow. When Cortex fails to defeat Crash, Uka Uka becomes furious, and announces that he is replacing Doctor Cortex, much to the shock of his minions. In a lab on the island's giant tree, Uka Uka expresses his relief with Nina Cortex's higher competence, but begins to sense Aku Aku's presence nearby, and decides to stay in the lab and kill Crash Bandicoot himself. Uka Uka confronts Crash as the penultimate boss by using Doctor Cortex's Evolvo-Ray on himself, giving him a gargantuan body made from the tree's wood. When the Evolvo-Ray is destroyed, Uka Uka claims that he will have the last laugh, as Nina is about to launch the Doominator, threatening the existence of Wumpa Island. Uka Uka is absent in the Nintendo DS version of the game. In Crash: Mind over Mutant, Uka Uka is subdued and placed in a milking machine by Doctor Neo Cortex and Doctor Nitrus Brio so that he can be used as a source of the bad Mojo needed to control those using the mass- produced NV device. He is eventually freed by Crash and Aku Aku, and promises to take the two to Cortex's new space station if his magical bones are returned to him. When this task is completed, Uka Uka keeps his promise and warps Crash and Aku Aku to Cortex's space station as an act of vengeance against Cortex. Dingodile Dingodile is the ally of Doctor Neo Cortex. Dingodile was conceptualized by Naughty Dog employee Joe Labbe, who requested a character that was a cross between a dingo and a crocodile. Charles Zembillas drew the first sketches of Dingodile on February 4, 1998. At certain points, the character alternatively wore an Australian-style hat, had a \\"mop of scruffy hair\\" and walked on all fours. Naughty Dog initially wanted Dingodile to be a fire-breathing character before Zembillas suggested giving him a flamethrower to make him \\"much more interesting\\". The final sketches of Dingodile were drawn on February 12, 1998. Zembillas has expressed happiness at Dingodile's enthusiastic following amongst fans. Dingodile is voiced by William Hootkins in Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped, by David Anthony Pizzuto in Crash Team Racing, by Dwight Schultz in Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Twinsanity, by Nolan North in the Nintendo DS version of Crash of the Titans, and by Fred Tatasciore from Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy onwards. Dingodile made his debut in the video game Crash Bandicoot: Warped as the second boss of the game. Here, he is seen serving under Uka Uka and Doctor Cortex, attempting to take whatever Crystals Crash has gathered and bringing them to Cortex during the Ice Age under his orders. Crash encounters Dingodile as he is about to kill a penguin, who runs away upon Crash's arrival. When Dingodile is defeated, he warns Crash of the more powerful enemies he will face ahead as the penguin he tried to kill earlier hops up and down on his charred body. Dingodile is a playable character in Crash Team Racing and Crash Bash. The epilogue of Crash Team Racing states that Dingodile created an animal breeding program to create unique and interesting pets. In the Nitro-Fueled remake, he instead becomes a firefighter, and becomes so successful at it that he is featured on the yearly fireman calendar. Dingodile appears as an attendee of Uka Uka's bad guy convention. He later serves as an obstacle in certain levels, firing spurts of flamethrower ammo in an attempt to stop Crash. In Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure, Dingodile serves as the first boss. He fights Crash in a shark-infested underwater cavern, and fires torpedoes at the cavern ceiling in an attempt to impale Crash with the falling stalactites, but eventually manages to impale himself, leaving him open for attack. He is later merged with Doctor Cortex, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger, and becomes Mega-Mix. After chasing Crash down a space station hall, Mega-Mix is left inside the space station, which explodes with the villains in it. Dingodile is a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart. In the game's story, Dingodile is seen assisting Doctor N. Gin when the tower the villains are standing in is abducted. The next time he is seen, he is brainwashed by N. Trance and racing under N. Trance's team, which drives green vehicles. In Crash Twinsanity, Dingodile is seen as one of the attendees of Crash's \\"birthday party\\" (which is really a gathering of past villains in the Crash series). After watching the ensuing boss battle, he discusses lunch with Ripper Roo. Later, he is seen reading inside a small shack, but is interrupted when a large snowball (containing Crash and Cortex) crushes the shack with him in it. As Cortex laments his humiliation, Dingodile learns of the Evil Twins' treasure, and secretly follows Crash and Cortex to the boiler room of Madame Amberley's Academy of Evil, where he tries to kill Crash for the treasure, believing he already has it. However, with the help of the boiler room's emergengy sprinkler system, Crash is able to disable Dingodile's flamethrower and beat him into submission. Dingodile is last seen laying unconscious in the boiler room. While Dingodile doesn't appear in the console version of Crash of the Titans, he appears as the first boss in the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance versions on the game. In the Nintendo DS version, Dingodile is assigned to stalling Crash Bandicoot while the other villains gather materials and build Neo Cortex's new CortexBot. Dingodile attempts to defeat Crash with a new water cannon, but ultimately fails. In the Game Boy Advance version, Dingodile is given the task of sending barrels of oil from Wumpa Island to Tiki Island. He is defeated by Crash, who attacks him with inhabited beehives. Doctor Nitrus Brio Doctor Nitrus Brio is a scientist who formerly worked under Doctor Neo Cortex. Brio was created by Naughty Dog as a foil for Doctor Cortex: \\"meek to Cortex's strength, logical to Cortex's emotional, successful (his inventions work) to Cortex's failure\\". Brio is voiced by Brendan O'Brien in the Naughty Dog games and Crash Bash; Maurice LaMarche in Crash: Mind over Mutant and Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy; Tom Kenny in Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled; and Roger Craig Smith in Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. His name is often abbreviated to \\"N. Brio\\", a wordplay on \\"embryo\\". As a child, Nitrus Brio was a classmate of Neo Cortex and N. Gin in Madame Amberly's Academy of Evil. Brio is responsible for creating the first fully functional Evolvo-Ray. However, his lack of self-esteem allowed Doctor Cortex to take credit for the creation. Brio is the penultimate boss of the first game, transforming himself into a hulking beast (through use of his trademark mutagenic agent), to combat Crash. After his failure, Brio left Cortex to become a bartender. Whilst away, he plotted to destroy Cortex for good with the use of a giant laser. Brio manages to convince Crash to gather the 42 Gems needed for the laser to be operational, and gives him the honor of activating the weapon, destroying Cortex's space station. While Brio does not appear in the original Crash Team Racing, a brand of beakers used as weapons during the races feature his name. Brio reunites with Cortex as a playable character in Crash Bash. In Crash Twinsanity, Brio teams up with Doctor Nefarious Tropy to defeat Crash and steal the Evil Twins' treasure. He appears alongside Tropy in a boss fight, immediately following Crash's escape from N. Gin's battleship, in which Brio (after being instructed by N. Tropy to \\"get changed\\") drinks a potion to transform himself into a large, green frog-like monster. He then appears (in his human form) alongside N. Tropy and N. Gin again in the Evil Twins' fortress, claiming the Twins' treasure for themselves. However, they are thwarted by Spyro the Dragon, who had been trapped in the Twins' vault. Brio reunites with Neo Cortex once more in Crash: Mind over Mutant, in which he aids in the development of the NV, a personal digital assistant that can control both mutants and bandicoots. He uses recycled parts from the Sludge Junkyard to mass-produce NVs and create a new space station for Doctor Cortex. Throughout the game, he claims to be the inventor of numerous things, including recycling, Slinkies and endings (though he does acknowledge he did not invent LiteBrite). He is found in the Junkyard with a brainwashed Crunch Bandicoot by Crash and Aku Aku, who are then attacked by Crunch under Brio's orders. When Crunch is broken free from the NV's control, Brio is forced to reveal the whereabouts of Uka Uka, who is acting as the source of the negative Mojo needed to control those wearing NVs. He is then told to leave the island, but promises that it is not the end. Doctor Nefarious Tropy Doctor Nefarious Tropy is a henchman and old friend of Uka Uka and the self- proclaimed master of time. He was created by Naughty Dog as a time-traveling boss that would fit in a time-traveling plot. Charles Zembillas drew the first sketches of Tropy (and the doodle he created as Naughty Dog was describing the character to him) on January 22, 1998. Tropy's wearable time-traveling device was conceptualized early on in the character's design evolution and initially appeared as a belt-like contraption that featured a digital read out displaying the year Tropy intended to travel to. At one point in its aesthetic development, Tropy's time machine was covered in clock gears and mechanisms, including a cuckoo clock on the machine's lower-right area; Zembillas assumed that the details could be created as a texture in Adobe Photoshop and placed over the modeled character's polygon structure. Furthermore, the pistons on the back of the machine were connected to each other through joint-like bearings. These details were ultimately omitted for being too complex for the original PlayStation console to handle. The exhaust pipes and pistons were retained due to their reflection of Tropy's unhealthy obsession with time. Tropy is voiced by Michael Ensign in the Naughty Dog games, Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Twinsanity, Corey Burton in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, and JP Karliak in Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, with his female counterpart voiced by Sarah Tancer in It's About Time. His name is abbreviated as N. Tropy, which is a play on \\"entropy\\", a comment on his clock-like form. Doctor Nefarious Tropy is introduced by Uka Uka in Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped as the creator of the Time-Twisting Machine, a device that will aid Neo Cortex in his quest to gather the Crystals in their original places in time. He later acts as the third boss of the game, battling Crash with his gigantic tuning fork. When Cortex is defeated, the Time-Twisting Machine implodes on itself, trapping Cortex, Uka Uka and Tropy in a time prison, where they are transformed into infants. Tropy appears in Crash Team Racing as the player's opponent during the Time Trial races and later as an unlockable playable character. The game's epilogue states that Tropy resumed his time machine hobby after the events of the game, and was last seen entering an ancient rainforest. In the Nitro-Fueled remake, he instead travels to a city in the future and went back after meeting a Marty McFly-like character. N. Tropy has a minor appearance in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, in which he is an attendee of Uka Uka's convention and an occasional enemy in the game, attempting to hinder Crash's progress. He is the main antagonist of Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, in which he kidnaps Crunch, Coco and Fake Crash and hypnotizes them into working for him. He is later defeated by Crash and is forced to take a group picture with the Bandicoots. Tropy is an unlockable character in Crash Nitro Kart, where he races under Neo Cortex's team. Tropy appears again in Crash Twinsanity, where he works with Doctor Nitrus Brio in order to learn the whereabouts of the treasure of the Evil Twins. When interrogating Crash proves fruitless, the duo attack him, sending him back to Cortex's Iceberg Lab. They eventually reach the treasure trove of the Evil Twins, but are chased out by Spyro the Dragon. Tropy also has a cameo appearance in the \\"Silhouette Quiz\\" minigame in Crash Boom Bang! Nina Cortex Nina Cortex is the gothic niece of Doctor Neo Cortex. She is voiced by Susan Silo in Crash Twinsanity, Amy Gross in the Radical Entertainment games, and Debi Derryberry in Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled and the DS version of Crash of the Titans. She sometimes aids her uncle in his quest for world domination, though they have had a recent falling-out due to a failed plot headed by her and Cortex's boss Uka Uka. Nina Cortex was originally created and designed by Duke Mighten for Traveller's Tales as a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart before development duties of the game were transferred to Vicarious Visions. During her conception it was undecided whether she would be Neo Cortex's daughter or niece, hence the deliberate discrepancies regarding her relationship with Cortex in Crash Twinsanity. As everyone kept referring to her as Neo's niece, the label stuck and became official. Her appearance was based on one of the designers working at Traveller's Tales. Nina is known to be more ambitious and egotistical than her uncle; even Aku Aku believes that Nina is \\"a lot smarter than Cortex ever could be.\\" Despite her self-admittedly antisocial demeanor, she is said to have a love for animals. Nina's most distinguishing features are her spring- loaded steel bionic hands, which were given to her by her uncle Doctor Cortex. When Nina Cortex started to show signs of a kind heart, Doctor Cortex modified her arms with bionic parts and enrolled her in Madame Amberly's Academy of Evil, which he himself attended as a child. She doesn't see her uncle again until the Evil Twins threaten the existence of the N. Sanity Island in Crash Twinsanity, during which Doctor Cortex sneaks her out of the school to assist him in defeating the Evil Twins. When Crash, Cortex and Nina travel to the Tenth Dimension, Nina is kidnapped by the feral Evil Crash and taken to his house, where Cortex soon rescues Nina though he ends up being chased by Evil Crash instead. She later helps in defeating the Evil Twins by destroying the power sources of their Deathbot. In Crash of the Titans, Nina appears as the main antagonist. When Cortex once again fails to dispose of Crash Bandicoot, she reveals that she was behind his actions throughout the game and even has Uka Uka serve under her. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, Nina attempts to take over Cortex's plot on her own accord when she realizes that she's merely a henchman. When Crash confronts her inside the Doominator, Nina boards her giant Arachnina Titan and battles Crash, only to lose. When the Doominator is disabled, she is rescued from the falling contraption by Doctor Cortex, who reveals that he is proud that she betrayed him, but proceeds to drop her off at his public school as punishment for doing so, as seen in Crash: Mind over Mutant. When she is eventually visited by Crash and Aku Aku, she angrily accuses Crash of ruining her life and refuses to help them stop Cortex's ongoing plot. When Crash and Aku Aku get desperate, she forces the two to kiss each other and save her science fair project. She then uses the said project to determine the location of Crunch and Brio, who are at the Sludge's Junkyard. In Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage and Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy, Nina is recruited by Doctor Cortex to kidnap Coco Bandicoot and the Professor. When Spyro and Crash arrive to save Coco and the Professor, Nina chases down Crash, only to soon be captured in a cage. Nina is a playable character in Crash Tag Team Racing, in which she aids Doctor Cortex and N. Gin in trying to take over Von Clutch's MotorWorld. Nina's introduction in Crash Twinsanity was met with a positive response among critics. James B. Pringle of IGN said that Nina \\"almost steals the show with her sassy skip and her Bionic Commando-like extension arm\\" and admitted that he \\"actually wouldn't mind seeing more of Nina in the future.\\" Nick Valentino of GameZone praised her as \\"an inventive character\\", a \\"very welcome addition to the series\\" and \\"one of the many highlights this game has to offer\\". He also compared her bionic arms to Bionic Commando.

The fair is typically held in the last full week of August. It consists of thousands of people camping at the fairgrounds in large, green, rented tents with asphalt floors. Thousands more stay in their own recreational vehicles, parked on the grounds. In addition to those staying on the fair grounds, daily visitors come for rides, food, bingo, animal shows, livestock contests and concerts. Families stay in the same tent each year and tent locations are often passed down through generations. After the space for the tents reached maximum capacity a wait list was started. The wait list was cancelled after 3 decades when it exceeded 500 families, some of which waited 27 years. You can no longer apply for a tent. On the last day of 140th Grange Fair, it was announced that the 2015 Grange Fair will be moving a week earlier and adding 1 day, with the fair going from 7 days to 9 days. Historically those renting tents would move in on Tuesday with those renting spaces with campers move in starting as early as the Sunday before the fair opened to those not camping on the grounds on that Thursday for season ticket holders. The 2005 Emmy awarding winning documentary film The Grange Fair: An American Tradition directed by Joe Myers chronicles the 131st Grange Fair.

Burns was the first woman hired in the Walt Disney Imagineering department within the Walt Disney Company.  Biography   Early life  Burns was born Harriet Tapp in San Antonio, Texas, on August 20, 1928, and raised in Seguin, Texas. She earned her bachelor's degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas and studied advanced design at the University of New Mexico. Harriet Tapp married William Burns, and the couple moved to Los Angeles with their infant daughter in 1953. William Burns died in 1986.  Walt Disney Imagineering  Burns' first job in Los Angeles was at Dice Display Industries Cooperative Exchange. She designed props and sets for television shows, including the Colgate Comedy Hour, as well as interiors and sets for floor shows and hotels in Las Vegas, including The Dunes. She also worked at a tourist attraction theme park in Lake Arrowhead, California, called Santa's Village during the mid-1950s. When the attraction closed, a friend advised Burns to apply for open positions at Disney. Burns began working at Disney Studios in 1955 as a prop and set painter for the Mickey Mouse Club. She helped to design and build the famed Mouse Clubhouse which was a featured fixture on the show. Her appearance caused her to stand out on the set, as she dressed in high heels and a skirt to work with the hardware and tools, such as the drill press and sanders. Burns shared a workstation at the Disney Studio with a fellow Disney employee named Fred Joerger. Joerger was a model builder for WED Enterprises, which is now known as Walt Disney Imagineering. He was working on prototype models for the future Disneyland theme park. In addition to her job as a set builder, Burns began working with Joerger in Disney's model shop building miniature prototypes of Disneyland buildings and attractions. WED Enterprises originally consisted of just three members -- Harriet Burns, Fred Joerger and Wathel Rogers -- and became known as the WED Model Shop. WED Enterprises was eventually renamed to Walt Disney Imagineering, which alluded to the engineering and imagination needed to design Disney theme park attractions. Burns contributed greatly to the development of Disneyland at WED Enterprises by creating both miniature models and actual theme park attractions. One of Burns's first assignments was to craft a model of Sleeping Beauty Castle, a Disneyland landmark which opened with the theme park on July 17, 1955. She continued to work on Disneyland expansions after the park's grand opening. Burns designed models of the Matterhorn Bobsleds attraction as a 1/100th scale replica of the famous Matterhorn in Switzerland. Another of Burns's job at Disneyland was what is called \\"figure-finishing.\\" Figure-finishing involves applying paint and other finishes to Disneyland attractions and mannequins to create a \\"finished\\" look. Burns personally designed and painted the set pieces and underwater figurines for the Submarine Voyage ride. She applied individual feathers to the animatronic birds in Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room, which opened in 1963. Burns later confessed in a 2005 interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the Tiki Room birds were one of her most challenging projects ever. \\"When they breathed out, it would be fine, but when they came back they scrunched. They looked like they had mites.\\" She managed to fix the look of the birds and actively maintained the Tiki Room attraction after its opening. Similarly, she created the birds for the film, Mary Poppins. Burns also helped with the models and final designs of New Orleans Square, one of the themed lands at Disneyland. She also designed the attractions within New Orleans Square. She built an exact model of the entire Pirates of the Caribbean dark ride, which opened in 1967, and was also a figure finisher on the pirates mannequins. She similarly designed The Haunted Mansion, which opened to the public in 1969. Outside of Disneyland, Burns was part of a team of Disney employees, which included Joyce Carlson, which created several Disney attractions for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Burns contributions to the World's Fair including designing Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, which later opened at Disneyland, and the Carousel of Progress. Her work earned the attention of Walt Disney. He featured Burns on several episodes of The Wonderful World of Color, a 1960s television show which gave a behind-the-scenes look at the Walt Disney Company, including its theme parks. Burns retired from Walt Disney Imagineering in 1986. She was honored in 1992 with a window display of her work on Main Street, U.S.A. in Disneyland with a commemorative plaque that reads, \\"The Artisans Loft, Handmade Miniatures by Harriet Burns.\\" She was the first woman in Disney history to receive this honor. Burns was also designated a Disney Legend by the Walt Disney Company in 2000, as an employee \\"whose imagination, talents and dreams have created the Disney magic.\\"  Death  Harriet Burns died of complications from a heart condition at USC University Hospital in Los Angeles on July 25, 2008, at the age of 79. Burns was survived by her daughter, Pam Burns-Clair; two sisters, Wilma Draves and Suzie Mosteller; two granddaughters, Chelsea and Haley Clair; and many extended family members. She was a resident of Santa Barbara, California where she had been active in the arts and music community.

He is frequently categorized with a number of his contemporaries, including Charles Wakefield Cadman, Arthur Nevin, Charles Sanford Skilton, Preston Ware Orem, and Arthur Farwell, as a member of the Indianist movement in American music. Life Lieurance was a native of Oskaloosa, Iowa, but his family relocated to Kansas when he was very young. Little is recorded about his early education; it is known that his father encouraged him to be a pharmacist, but that he preferred instead to follow a career in music. Upon the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War he enlisted as a musician. With the cessation of hostilities, he moved to Ohio and enrolled in the Cincinnati College of Music, studying there until his savings from military service ran out. He was able to continue studying with Herman Bellstedt, a cornetist and bandmaster under John Philip Sousa. During his time at the Cincinnati College of Music, he studied theory, orchestration, harmony and arranging. In 1900 he sang with the chorus of Castle Square Garden Opera Company to learn of opera and its production. Around 1905, Lieurance joined the Chautauqua Society, working in traveling tent schools teaching music to American Indians. The contacts he made through this position led to an interest in Indian culture; he began to try to transcribe the songs that he heard, and began to teach himself the craft of making traditional Native American flutes. At about this time polio left Lieurance disabled; though he had very little use of his legs he was quite vigorous and mobile. Around 1909, Lieurance acquired a portable cylinder recording device from Edison Records, and carried it with him whenever he went to visit Indian performers. In October 1911 he recorded a Crow (Apsalooke) (maybe Oglala Lakota Sioux) singer, Sitting Eagle, also known as Mortimer Dreamer, then living on the Crow Reservation in Montana. From this recording he took the melody for his song \\"By the Waters of the Minnetonka\\". He set it to a harp-like accompaniment, and it was published by Theodore Presser in 1913 as \\"an Indian love song\\" with words by J. M. Cavanass, becoming an instant success and going through several editions; it was also frequently recorded in the years before 1950. Indian Songs by Thurlow Lieurance The early editions of the published arrangements in 1915, 1917, and 1921 called for a violin or flute to echo the vocal melody, playing either a provided melody or ad lib. Possibly because of this, the melody is often played on the Native American flute. The performance notes from Lieurance's 1921 edition suggest: > A violin typifies the wind, if you choose, echoes the soft harmonies of the > accompaniment which rocks to and fro on harp chords, between the major key > and its relative minor, in and out of that singular domain musicians know as > the ‚Äúadded Sixth‚Äù chord and its derivatives. A typewritten note found among the composer's papers describes the legend behind the song: > Moon Deer, daughter of the Moon Clan, loved Sun Deer of the Sun Clan. Tribal > law forbade marriage between the two clans. It was decreed that daughters of > the Moon Clan must marry into the Eagle Clan. The two lovers, in tears, ran > away far to the east and north. They came to a beautiful lake called > Minnetonka (Minne means water; Tonka means large and round). Their happiness > was disturbed because their traditional enemies, the Chippewa, lived on the > north shore of this lake. They feared to return home and be separated, and > finally in desperation they decided to end it all. The legend states that > they disappeared beneath the waves and were no more. The waves moaned a > rhythmic sound and the pines crooned their love song. Many moons afterwards > the warriors of the Sioux drove the Chippewa north to Lake Superior. One > night while they were camped on the shores of Lake Minnetonka, they heard > the waters singing a weird melody and, in the moon-path on the waters, two > lilies appeared and grew to the skies. The lilies were the spirits of Moon > Deer and Sun Deer. Lieurance himself recognized how important to his career the song had been, later saying that > That night marked an epoch in my life, opened to me a new world. What work I > have since done has been due chiefly to that song. Thousands of people have > heard it, clothed with the harmonizing which our ears demand; it is lying > upon music Tables all over the land, has been sung by many of the world's > famous singers, including Schuman-Heink, Julia Culp and Alice Nielson. Lieurance married, in 1917, Edna Woolley, and she took part in his recital tours thereafter. She would wear an Indian costume and play the part of \\"\\". Such was the success of these recitals that Lieurance was able to return to school in Cincinnati, finally gaining his degree there in 1924. The couple retired from concertizing in 1926 and settled into teaching positions, working briefly at the University of Nebraska before coming to the University of Wichita. Lieurance eventually became the school's Dean of Fine Arts. The couple retired from the university in 1945. Lieurance and his wife were invited by Theodore Presser to travel to Europe in the early 1930s. Upon their return, the composer was given support for his research into Native American music when he received a grant from the Scientific Research Society of America. Later in the decade, he helped to found the Minisa Symphony Orchestra in Wichita; most of his orchestral music was written for this group. Upon retirement, Lieurance and his wife moved to Neosho Falls, Kansas. Their house there was destroyed by flood in 1952, and the couple moved to Boulder, Colorado, where Lieurance died in 1963. Today the couple's papers may be found in the music library of Wichita State University, which has been named for the composer. Much of Lieurance's research collection is housed in the Smithsonian Institution.\\"American Indians inspired Kansas composer\\", The Wichita Eagle and Kansas.com, May 31, 2010. Music Apart from \\"By the Waters of Minnetonka\\", Lieurance wrote over 300 works, his first composition was entitled \\"A Prayer\\". Included in his works were a number of orchestral pieces, with titles such as Trails Southwest, The Conquistadors, and Sad Moon on Falling Leaf. Much of the rest of his output consisted of songs and works for choir, but he also composed an opera, The Drama of Yellowstone.

Rather than converting a working ranch, Burt and Carncross built a tourist-oriented dude ranch from the ground up, using a style called \\"Dude Ranch Vernacular\\", which featured log construction and rustic detailing. As one of the first dude ranches in Jackson Hole, the Bar B C was a strong influence on other dude ranches in the area, and employed a number of people who went on to establish their own operations. It was acquired by the National Park Service and incorporated into Grand Teton National Park upon the expiration of a life estate. The ranch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. History Struthers Burt had previously started the first true dude ranch in Jackson Hole, the JY, in 1908 with Louis Joy. The JY's patrons included Owen Wister, whose writings did much to popularize dude ranches. However, Joy and Burt fell out. Established in 1912 by Burt and Horace Carncross, the B C was given a boost by the outbreak of World War I, which restricted American travel to Europe. Many Easterners came west, and Jackson Hole was particularly popular among Philadelphians. In 1917 Burt and Carncross borrowed $9200 to expand the ranch from the Philadelphia Trust Company. The standard of service and cuisine rose rapidly (Burt described early food as \\"bad\\"), moving from canned vegetables in the early years to fresh vegetables and dairy produced at the ranch by the early 1920s. By 1922 it was incorporated as Bar B C Ranches and was one of the largest operations in the valley, able to house fifty dudes in 45 buildings. Burt and Carncross also operated the White Grass for Harold Hammond and George Bispham during this time, briefly buying the White Grass operation before selling it back. New partners Irving Corse and Joe LePage joined the operation, having worked their way through the organization as cowboys, wranglers and foremen. The B C site was carefully selected by Burt and Carncross after considering views, water, soil, timber, and a relative lack of mosquitoes. Carncross, a 41-year- old physician from Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, hoped that the dude ranch business would lead to a cattle ranching operation. Rather than buying an existing operation, Burt and Carncross established the B C as a homestead claim on adjacent tracts of for Burt and for Carncross, claiming more land in subsequent years. By 1917 the B C amounted to more than . In 1924 Burt and Carncross bought a ranch near the Gros Ventre River to raise cattle and hay, naming it the Lower Bar BC. In 1924, Burt published Diary of a Dude Wrangler in the Saturday Evening Post. Burt was himself a Princeton-educated Easterner who wrote on a wide range of subjects, including the West. Burt's wife, Katharine Newlin Burt (1882‚Äì1977) and son Nathaniel Burt (1913‚Äì2003) were also published writers. Consequently, the Bar B C tended to attract writers. Guests included Harry W. Frantz and Burt's friends from Princeton, including David Adler. HABS plan of the Bar BC in 1982 During the 1920s Burt became an active advocate for conservation in Jackson Hole, opposing plans to build a dam at the outlet of Jenny Lake. In 1923 Burt participated in a meeting with Horace Albright, director of the National Park Service, at Maud Noble's cabin at Menor's Ferry, which established a plan for the protection of Jackson Hole. After 1927 the Snake River Land Company, operating on behalf of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., began to buy Jackson Hole land for eventual transfer to the National Park Service. In 1929 Burt and his then-partner Irving Corse sold the Bar B C in return for a life estate that allowed the dude operation to continue. Carncross had died in 1928 at his home in Pennsylvania, soon followed by Joe LePage. Grand Teton National Park was established in 1929, encompassing the Teton Range. It would not be until 1943, when Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed Jackson Hole National Monument, assembled largely from Snake River Land Company holdings, that the ranch would exist within the protected lands. In 1929, Burt bought land along Pacific Creek where he established a dude ranch-like private retreat, naming it Three Rivers Ranch. During the 1930s Burt and Corse disagreed over management and profit sharing, and in 1937 Corse bought out Burt. Corse believed that authenticity demanded that the ranch look \\"run down\\", and neglected maintenance. A series of fires caused some necessary rebuilding, and in 1934 Corse moved Joe LePage's cabin to the ranch. Corse also built a small airstrip and hangar on the property. During World War II Corse suspended the ranch operation to be a flight instructor at the University of Wyoming. After the war, Corse's health declined, and he died in 1953. Margaretta Corse subleased the ranch to T.H. and Margaretta Frew Conderman (of the 4 Lazy F Dude Ranch Frews), who operated the ranch as short-term-stay tourist cabins from 1950 to 1959. Afterwards, Mrs. Corse managed the ranch until 1985, when she could no longer continue. Mrs. Corse died in 1988. The life estate was terminated, and the property reverted to the Park Service. Description The historic district at the Bar B C includes 37 structures, including cabins, a lodge, a dining hall, a laundry/utility building, man-made ponds, barns, sheds and corrals. The site is at the western edge of the Snake River bottomlands, nestled against a river terrace to the west. A central road climbs from the ranch through a cutting in the hillside. The buildings are chiefly 1- or -story log structures, rectangular in shape. Roofing is red or green asphalt roll roofing. The property layout is apparently casual, but centers on the dining hall and lodge, with cabins on either side of the main path, flanked by corrals to the north and the barn to the south. While the exteriors are in good condition and are considered contributing features, the interiors have lost much of their character through alterations and loss of fixtures. The informally styled ranch was widely copied by later dude ranches, and is considered a prototype of the genre. Offspring As one of the first dude ranches in the area, the B C inspired former dudes and employees to establish their own operations. Bar B C alumni established the White Grass, Sun Star, and the STS Ranch. Others, such as Maud Noble, who bought Menor's Ferry, or Cissy Patterson, established personal retreats. The ranch operated until after World War II, when the cabins became summer rental cabins. Present situation The main ranch is included in Grand Teton National Park. The buildings have received limited maintenance since 1986. Many structures have deteriorated, and some have been partially demolished, but preservation work, coordinated from the National Trust for Historic Preservation Western Center at the White Grass Ranch, has stabilized the Carncross Cabin and the main lodge. The Bar B C was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1990. The 2016 National Park Service historic properties management report for Granbd Teton National Park recommended that 24 of the 34 buildings on the site be stabilized in- kind, three more extensively repaired, and seven salvaged for materials or allowed to deteriorate. The property would be managed as a day-use area where techniques of architectural preservation could be taught and practiced. A residential property development on the former Lower B C Ranch property, just south of the Three Rivers Ranch, is now called the Bar BC Ranch.

The movement was most influential in the United States in the 1930s through 1970s, and began to wane in the 1980s. It arose with early interest in historical performance and was strongly influenced by Albert Schweitzer's championing of historical instruments by Gottfried Silbermann and others, as well as by Schweitzer's opinion that organs should be judged primarily by their ability to perform with clarity the polyphonic Baroque music of J. S. Bach (1685‚Äì1750). Concert organist E. Power Biggs was a leading popularizer of the movement in the United States, through his many recordings and radio broadcasts. The movement ultimately went beyond the \\"Neo-Baroque\\" copying of old instruments to endorse a new philosophy of organ building, \\"more Neo than Baroque\\". The movement arose in response to perceived excesses of symphonic organ building, but eventually symphonic organs regained popularity after the reform movement generated excesses of its own.  Characteristics  Holtkamp Organ #1,939 (1978‚Äì2015) at University of Notre Dame The Organ Reform Movement sought to turn away from many of the perceived excesses of Romantic or Symphonic organ building and repertoire, in favor of organs understood to be more similar to those of the Baroque Era in Northern Germany, especially those built by Arp Schnitger. This took the form of a \\"vertical\\" style of tonal registration in which ensembles were ideally built up with no pitch being duplicated in the same octave, and then the ensembles were crowned with high-pitched mixture stops. The movement endorsed the so-called Werkprinzip, in which each division of the instrument's pipework was based on a principal- scale rank of a different octave. Organ voicers strove for an articulate pipe speech characterized by a short burst of \\"chiff\\" sound at the start of each note, and avoided \\"nicking\\" the pipe edges and other techniques of achieving symphonic-style \\"smoothness\\". Low wind pressures were revived. Casework was sometimes eschewed in favor of open standing pipework, and shuttered swell boxes became less common. In Europe the movement was indelibly connected with tracker action (mechanical instruments). In North America this was less emphatic, and many US and Canadian instruments characteristic of the Organ Reform Movement had electro-pneumatic or direct electric action. North American buildings tend to have substantial architectural and acoustical differences from the European churches where most organ music was written, and this also had implications for successful organbuilding. Some of the leading organ-builders of the movement have been: * (in Northern Europe) Rudolf von Beckerath, Dirk Andries Flentrop, Frobenius Orgelbyggeri, Marcussen & S√∏n; * (in North America) G. Donald Harrison, Holtkamp Organ Company, Lawrence Phelps, C. B. Fisk, Schlicker Organ Company, Wicks Organ Company.  Reversals  A common criticism of the Organ Reform Movement is that its principles were often taken to extremes and became more dogmatic than musical, while ruining many fine symphonic organs and disappointing many listeners. Many of the Reform instruments survive, but some of the alterations that the movement executed on pre-movement instruments have since been reversed to support a wider range of repertoire, such as on the notable pipe organs of Auckland Town Hall, Princeton University Chapel, and Chicago's Rockefeller Chapel.

It is the seat of East Kotawaringin Regency. Sampit is the biggest timber port in all of Indonesia. Sampit is also known as Sampit, Tanah Hevea. According to reported data as of August 2009, the estimated population of Sampit is 66,053. The average elevation of the town is . History Sampit town became known worldwide following inter-ethnic violent communal clashes between the Dayaks and the Madurese during the Sampit conflict which broke out on February 17, 2001 and lasted for 10 days. There are a number of stories purportedly describing the incident that sparked the violence in 2001. One version claims that it was caused by an arson attack on a Dayak house. Rumours spread that the fire was caused by Madurese, and later a group of Dayaks began burning houses in a Madurese neighbourhood. Another version says that the massacre was triggered by an earlier incident in December 2000 when a Dayak man was killed by three Madurese. In just two weeks 469 were reported to have been killed, of which 456 of them were Madurese. Virtually the entire Madurese people fled and \\"ethnic cleansing\\" has taken place in Sampit and surrounding areas, despite the Madurese previously forming about 60% of the population. However, according to a BBC report, the overall picture of the conflict caused 500 deaths, with over 100,000 Madurese displaced from their homes. Many Madurese were also found decapitated by the Dayaks. Several hundreds of the immigrants fled from the area and moved by naval vessels to their homes in Madura island in East Java. Geography Sampit lies in southern-mid Borneo on the banks of the Sampit River also called the \\"Mentaya River\\" is a river of Central Kalimantan in Borneo.Rand McNally, The New International Atlas, 1993. The river takes its name from the town of Sampit which is situated on the bank of river not too distant from the Java Sea. The Schwaner mountain range extends with long hill ridges southwards, separating the major river systems of the area, most notably the Bukit Baka hill range which extends down to Sampit Bay. The area between the town of Sampit and the coast was historically heavily forested but has since been reduced due to road construction and development projects. To the north of Sampit, on the road to Pangkalanbun, is an area of peat-swamp forest. Sampit is from the mouth of the river. Road networks connect to the capital cities of the regency and one such road is the Palangkaraya-Sampit-Purukcahu. However, river transport is the common transport for communications. Apart from navigational approach from the Java Sea and inland road network, Sampit also has the Sampit Airport ,Great Circle Mapper: SMQ / WAOS ‚Äì Sampit, Borneo, Indonesia also known as H.

Aristotle defined envy as pain at the sight of another‚Äôs good fortune, stirred by ‚Äúthose who have what we ought to have.‚ÄùRhetoric By Aristotle Bertrand Russell said that envy was one of the most potent causes of unhappiness. Not only is the envious person rendered unhappy by their envy, Russell argued, but that person may also wish to inflict misfortune on others to reduce their status. Psychologists distinguish \\"true\\" (malicious) envy from benign envy‚Äîmalicious envy being proposed as an unpleasant emotion that causes the envious person to want to bring down the better-off even at their own cost, while benign envy involves recognition of other's being better-off, but causes the person to aspire to be as good. Types of envy Psychologists have suggested that real or malicious envy should be distinguished from \\"benign envy\\"‚Äîmalicious envy being proposed as an unpleasant emotion that causes the envious person to want bring down the better-off even at their own cost, while benign envy involves recognition of other's being better-off, but causes the person to aspire to be as good. However, Sherry Turkle considers that the advent of social media and selfie culture is creating an alienating sense of ‚Äúself-envy‚Äù psyche in users, and posits this further affects problem areas attached to attachments. Envy and gloating have parallel structures as emotions. The only type of envy that can have positive effects also is benign envy. According to researchers, benign envy can provide emulation, improvement motivation, positive thoughts about the other person, and admiration. This type of envy, if dealt with correctly, can positively affect a person's future by motivating them to be a better person and to succeed. Our human instinct is to avoid negative aspects in life such as the negative emotion, envy. However, it is possible to turn this negative emotional state into a motivational tool that can help a person to become successful in the future.  Socioevolutionary view  allegorical painting by Giotto di Bondone, ca. 1305-1306 One theory that helps explain envy and its effects on human behavior is the socioevolutionary theory. Based upon Charles Darwin's 1859 theory of evolution by natural selection, modern socio-evolutionary theory predicts that humans behave in ways that enhance the reproduction of their genes. Consistent with envy being a motivation, it may boost attention and memory. Based on a model of evolved responses to those who are better off, Sznycer has argued that envy increases support for economic redistribution.  Schadenfreude  Schadenfreude means taking pleasure in the misfortune of others and can be understood as an outgrowth of envy in certain situations. Envy and schadenfreude are very similar and are linked emotional states. Both emotions are considered very complex and oftentimes looked down upon, which is understandable considering they are both antisocial behaviors. Given the detrimental states of these emotions, it is very important to understand their development in the early stages of childhood. The two social emotions, envy and schadenfreude, act together as sister emotions during the developmental stages in adolescents. Both emotions have a strong presence during these early stages in a child's life. In previous studies, it has been shown that envy becomes less prevalent as a child gets older. Researchers believe that this results from an increase in the regulation of envious type emotions as a person ages and gains more wisdom about life. Depending on age, the correlation of envy and schadenfreude increases. For example, a younger child is more likely to make spiteful decisions when they feel envious towards a person.  Regarding possessions or status  Hieronymus Bosch, The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things (Invidia) Often, envy involves a motive to \\"outdo or undo the rival's advantages\\".D'Arms, J. (2009). Envy. Unpublished manuscript, Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy, Stanford, Retrieved from Plato.stanford.edu/entries/envy/ In part, this type of envy may be based on materialistic possessions rather than psychological states. Basically, people find themselves experiencing an overwhelming emotion due to someone else owning or possessing desirable items that they do not. For example, your next door neighbor just bought a brand new ocarina‚Äîa musical instrument you've been infatuated with for months now but can't afford. Feelings of envy in this situation would occur in the forms of emotional pain, a lack of self-worth, and a lowered self-esteem and well-being. In Nelson Aldrich's Old Money, he states that \\"envy is so integral and painful a part of what animates human behavior in market societies that many people have forgotten the full meaning of the word, simplifying it into one of the symptoms of desire. It is that (a symptom of desire), which is why it flourishes in market societies: democracies of desire, they might be called, with money for ballots, stuffing permitted. But envy is more or less than desire. It begins with the almost frantic sense of emptiness inside oneself, as if the pump of one's heart were sucking on air. One has to be blind to perceive the emptiness, of course, but that's what envy is, a selective blindness. Invidia, Latin for envy, translates as \\"nonsight,\\" and Dante had the envious plodding along under cloaks of lead, their eyes sewn shut with leaden wire. What they are blind to is what they have, God-given and humanly nurtured, in themselves\\".Hacker, Diana. A Canadian Writer's Reference, 2nd Ed. Nelson Canada, 1996. p. 23.  Overcoming  Envy may negatively affect the closeness and satisfaction of relationships. Overcoming envy might be similar to dealing with other negative emotions (anger, resentment, etc.). Individuals experiencing anger often seek professional treatment (anger management) to help understand why they feel the way they do and how to cope. Subjects experiencing envy often have a skewed perception on how to achieve true happiness. By helping people to change these perceptions, they will be more able to understand the real meaning of fortune and satisfaction with what they do have. According to Lazarus \\"coping is an integral feature of the emotion process\\". There are very few theories that emphasize the coping process for emotions as compared to the information available concerning the emotion itself. There are numerous styles of coping, of which there has been a significant amount of research done; for example, avoidant versus approach. Coping with envy can be similar to coping with anger. The issue must be addressed cognitively in order to work through the emotion. According to the research done by Salovey and Rodin (1988), \\"more effective strategies for reducing initial envy appear to be stimulus-focused rather than self-focused\\". Salovey and Rodin (1988) also suggest \\"self- bolstering (e.g., \\"thinking about my good qualities\\") may be an effective strategy for moderating these self-deprecating thoughts and muting negative affective reactions\\". Further research needs to be done in order to better understand envy, as well as to help people cope with this emotion. Benefits Russell believed that envy may be driving force behind the movement of economies and must be endured to achieve the \\"keep up with the Joneses\\" system. He believed this is what helps to maintain \\"democracy\\" as a system in which no one can achieve more than anyone else.Russell (1930), pp. 90‚Äì91 Attended too, envy may inform a person about who they admire and what they want. Benign envy may lead a person to work harder to achieve more success . In adolescence Children show evidence of envy at an early age. Adults can be just as envious; however, they tend to be better at concealing the emotion. Envy plays a significant role in the development of adolescents. Comparing oneself is a universal aspect of human nature. No matter the age or culture, social comparison happens all over the globe. Comparison can range from physical attributes, material possessions, and intelligence. However, children are more likely to envy over material objects such as shoes, video games, iPhones, etc. Kids believe these material objects are correlated to their status. Social status has been found to have a strong connection with self-esteem. An adolescent's self-esteem is very fragile during early years and is heavily impacted by peer opinion. If a child is comfortable with who they are and self-confident they are less likely to become envious of others' material objects, because they do not self-identify with materials. Material objects are not the only things that adolescents become envious over; however, it is the most prevalent. As children get older they develop stronger non- materialistic envy such as romantic relationships, physical appearance, achievement, and popularity. Sometimes envious feelings are internalized in children, having a negative impact on their self-esteem. Envy comes from comparing; these comparisons can serve as a reminder that they have failed social norms and do not fit in with their peers. A feeling of inadequacy can arise and become destructive to a child‚Äôs happiness and cause further internal damage. A child's identity is formed during their early years. Identity development is considered the central task during adolescence. When children grow up understanding who they are, they are able to better define what their strengths and weaknesses are while comparing themselves to others. Comparison can have two outcomes: it can be healthy in aiding in self-improvement or it can be unhealthy and result in envy/jealousy which can develop into depression. This is why self-exploration and identity development are critical in adolescent years. It is important to identify healthy and unhealthy envy in a child at an early age. If a child is showing signs of unhealthy envy, it is best to teach the child productive ways to handle these emotions. It is much easier to teach a child how to control their emotions while they are young rather than allowing them to develop a habit that is hard to break when they are older. In adulthood The things that drive people mad with envy change throughout their lifetime. Studies have shown that the younger the person, the more likely they are to be envious of others. Adults under the age of 30 are more likely to experience envy compared to those 30 years and older. However, what people become envious over differs across adulthood. Younger adults, under the age of 30, have been found to envy others social status, relationships, and attractiveness. This starts to fade when a person hits their 30s. Typically, at this point in life, the person begins to accept who they are as an individual and compare themselves to others less often. However, they still envy others, just over different aspects in life, such as career or salary. Studies have shown a decrease in envy as a person ages; however, envious feelings over money was the only thing that consistently increased as a person got older. As a person ages, they begin to accept their social status. Nonetheless, envious feelings will be present throughout a person‚Äôs life. It is up to the individual whether they will let these envious feelings motivate or destroy them.  Narcissists  Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder are often envious of others or believe others are envious of them.Narcissistic personality disorder - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV- TR) American Psychiatric Association (2000) A narcissist may secure a sense of superiority in the face of another person's ability by using contempt to minimize the other person.Hotchkiss, Sandy & Masterson, James F. Why Is It Always About You? : The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism (2003)  In philosophy  Aristotle, in Rhetoric, defined envy (œÜŒ∏œåŒΩŒøœÇ phthonos) as \\"the pain caused by the good fortune of others\\",2.7.1108b1-10 while Kant, in Metaphysics of Morals, defined it as \\"a reluctance to see our own well-being overshadowed by another's because the standard we use to see how well off we are is not the intrinsic worth of our own well-being but how it compares with that of others\\".  Religious views   In Buddhism  In Buddhism, the term irshya is commonly translated as either envy or jealousy. Irshya is defined as a state of mind in which one is highly agitated to obtain wealth and honor for oneself, but unable to bear the excellence of others. The term mudita (sympathetic joy) is defined as taking joy in the good fortune of others. This virtue is considered the antidote to envy and the opposite of schadenfreude.  In Christianity  Both in the Old and New Testament there are various descriptions of envy and events related to it, mostly with a dramatic outcome. Envy is one of the Seven deadly sins in Roman Catholicism. In the Book of Genesis envy is said to be the motivation behind Cain murdering his brother, Abel, as Cain envied Abel because God favored Abel's sacrifice over Cain's. Envy is among the things that comes from the heart, defiling a person. The whole body is full of darkness when the eye, the lamp of body, is bad. He who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished, said Solomon. Envy ruins the body's health, making bones rot and prohibiting the inheritance of the kingdom of God. Sometimes, as a punishment, people are left in their sins, falling prey to envy and other heavy sins.Romans 1:28-29-32, Bible, English standard Version, 1971, Biblegateway Envy is credited as the basis of all toil and skills of people. For example, mankind will choose occupations to gain wealth, fame and pleasures to equal or exceed their neighbours. Envy is, therefore, a sin deeply ingrained in human nature. It comes into being when man lacks certain things, a circumstance that exists when God is not approached for provision or when the provision is used for one's own selfish passions and pleasures.James 4.1-2-3 Envy may be caused by wealth (Isaac, envied by the Philistines), by the brightness of wealth, power and beauty (Assyria kingdom envied of other kingdoms), by political and military rising (Saul eyed David from the moment he heard the women song of joy), fertility (Leah, envied of Rachel), social ascent (Joseph whom his brothers were jealous of), countless miracles and healings (the apostles envied of high priest and the Sadducees), popularity (Paul and Barnabas, envied of unfaithful Jewish from Antioch), the success of Christianization of many Thessalonians (Paul and Silas, envied of unfaithful Jews from Thessalonica), virtues and true power to heal, to make miracles and to teach people (Jesus envied of the chief priests). In the NT, Jewish Christians are admonished to not look with evil eye at the last converts (\\"Gentiles\\" or Pagan Christians) to avoid therefore becoming the last ones, missing the kingdom of God. They should be happy for anyone saved, like Christ, who came to save the lost, as the shepherd seeking the lost sheep. Zacchaeus, the chief tax collector, was among the lost ones and he succeeded in bringing salvation to him and to his house. Sometimes arisen out of sophistry, envy cannot coexist with true and spiritual wisdom, but with false, earthly, unspiritual, demonic wisdom. Throwing away envy is a crucial condition in our path to salvation. Envy was seen by the Apostle Paul as a real danger even within the first Christian communities. Envy should remain a sin of the past, defeated by God's teaching, which, as in the tenth commandment, forbids us from coveting our neighbour's things, woman, and servants, and urges us to rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep, as Apostle Paul said, and to love our neighbours as ourselves. Because brotherly, Christian love banishes definitively envy from our hearts. File:Jacques Callot, The Seven Deadly Sins - Envy.JPGthumbThe Seven Deadly Sins - Envy, engraving by Jacques Callot.

In Hinduism, envy is considered a disastrous emotion. Hinduism maintains that anything which causes the mind to lose balance with itself leads to misery. This concept is put forth in the epic Mahabharata, wherein Duryodhana launches the Kurukshetra war out of envy of the perceived prosperity of his cousins. He is known to have remarked: \\"Father! The prosperity of the Pandavas (cousins) is burning me deeply! I cannot eat, sleep or live in the knowledge that they are better off than me!\\" Thus, Hinduism teaches that envy can be overcome simply by recognizing that the man or woman who is the object of one's envy is merely enjoying the fruits of their past karmic actions and that one should not allow such devious emotions to take control of their mind, lest they suffer the same fate as the antagonists of the Mahabharata.  In Islam  In Islam, envy (·∏•asad ÿ≠ÿ≥ÿØ in Arabic) is an impurity of the heart and can destroy one's good deeds. One must be content with what God has willed and believe in the justice of the creator. A Muslim should not allow his envy to inflict harm upon the envied person. Muhammad said, \\"Do not envy each other, do not hate each other, do not oppose each other, and do not cut relations, rather be servants of Allah as brothers. It is not permissible for a Muslim to disassociate from his brother for more than three days such that they meet and one ignores the other, and the best of them is the one who initiates the salaam.\\" Sahih al- Bukhari [Eng. Trans. 8/58 no. 91], Sahih Muslim [Eng. Trans. 4/1360 no. 6205, 6210] A Muslim may wish for himself a blessing like that which someone else has, without wanting it to be taken away from the other person. This is permissible and is not called ·∏•asad. Rather, it is called ghib·π≠a. \\"There is to be no envy except in two cases: (towards) a person to whom Allah has granted wisdom, and who rules by this and teaches it to the people, and (towards) a person to whom Allah has granted wealth and property along with the power to spend it in the cause of the Truth.\\" [Al-Bukhaari & Muslim]  In Judaism  In Judaism (in the Hebrew Bible 'jealousy', is a key feature of God's personality ‚Äì He is furious in jealousy (for His own people's undivided worship). YeHoVaH is jealous for His own. The God of Israel is, \\"slow to anger and great in compassion\\" (Exodus 34:6) but when His jealousy and anger had accumulated there was an outburst of punishment. (Exodus 34:6; Numbers 14:18; Psalm 103:8; Ps 86:15; Ps 145:8; Jonah 4:2; Nahum 1:3; Nehemiah 9:17; Joel 2:13 etc.) While jealousy is branded as a negative and unwanted emotion generally in society today and also in Christianity, which had developed out of Judaism, in the Biblical (so-called Old Testament) context it is a strong aspect of God's character and therefore not a flawed characteristic ‚Äì unlike envy, which God does denounce. (Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:9 and verse 18) We envy people when we want what they have. We are jealous when we want to keep for ourselves what belongs exclusively to us. Therefore we see the frightening permission God gave husbands who became jealous of their wives, to make them take a curse upon themselves, in case they had slept with another man while they belonged to their husband. (Numbers 5:11 ‚Äì 31) This points to the intimacy and exclusivity He is interested in, from His own people. Ephraim 'committed harlotry' against YHVH and thereby defiled the nation of Israel. Therefore He withdrew Himself from them, to their detriment: \\"Woe to those when I depart from them!\\" (Hosea 9:12), He warns. \\"They will cry to YHVH, but he will hide His face from them\\". (Micah 3:4) A wounded Lover speaking. \\"You paid, but were not paid; for your harlotry. Therefore, oh harlot, hear the Word of YHVH: I shall set My jealousy against you and they will deal furiously with you.\\" (Ezekiel 23:25) YHVH showed Ezekiel how the people in Jerusalem set up 'an image that provokes jealousy'. (Ezekiel 8:11, 12, 1 Kings 14:22, 2 Chronicles 14:2) God also loves like a jealous lover: He told Moses to make a breastplate for Aaron the priest, to wear when he goes into the Most Holy Place. On the breastplate he had to display the names of all the tribes of Israel, so He could see it whenever Aaron went in to work where YHVH's Presence was (Exodus 28:29). Somewhere else He says, I have your name engraved in the palm of My hand. (Isaiah 49:16) The God of Israel wants with His people a marriage of faithfulness, fairness, kindness and compassion ‚Äì and that they should know Him. (Hosea 2:21,22) He is even jealous for the land itself, the land of Israel. (Joel 2:18) \\"I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.. YHVH will yet comfort Zion and will yet choose Jerusalem.. For I will be to her a wall of fire all around; and the glory in her midst.\\" (Zechariah 1:14, 17, Zechariah 2:9) The Hebrew Bible says Judah provoked YHVH to jealousy with all their sins and their false gods. (1 Kings 14:22) There is a notable difference in meaning between jealousy (of something that is one's own) and envy (which is covetousness of another one's possessions). (Exodus 20: 14; Proverbs 27:4)  Cultural references  In English-speaking cultures, envy is often associated with the color green, as in \\"green with envy\\", and yellow.Eva Heller (2000), Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques, p. 33. Yellow is the color of ambivalence and contradiction; a color associated with optimism and amusement; but also with betrayal, duplicity, and jealousy. The phrase \\"green-eyed monster\\" refers to an individual whose current actions appear motivated by jealousy, not envy. This is based on a line from Shakespeare's Othello. Shakespeare mentions it also in The Merchant of Venice when Portia states: \\"How all the other passions fleet to air, as doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair and shuddering fear and green-eyed jealousy!\\" The character Envy from Fullmetal Alchemist series is one of the seven homunculi named after the seven deadly sins. The character of Zelena on ABC's Once Upon a Time takes on the title \\"The Wicked Witch of the West\\" after envy itself dyes her skin in the episode \\"It's Not Easy Being Green\\". In the parable \\"Garden of Statues\\", a character goes mad with envy because of all the attention his sculptor neighbor is getting. In Nelson W. Aldrich Jr.'s Old Money, he states that people who suffer from a case of malicious envy are blind to what good things they already have, thinking they have nothing, causing them to feel emptiness and despair.

Biography Born in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico in 1923, Hector Quintanilla, Jr. immigrated to the United States at age six with his parents and three brothers in 1929. He and his family crossed the Gateway to the Americas International Bridge in Laredo, Texas. His family made their home in west side San Antonio, around the Laredo and Martin street neighborhoods; the family could only afford a $1.25 a week shack with a dirt floor. Hector and his brothers did not mind, because they mostly wore their shoes on Sundays to go to church. He was selling newspapers for the San Antonio Express and San Antonio Light mornings and evenings by age seven. He would peddle his papers around the Baptist Medical Hospital area. Quintanilla also built a shoe box to shine shoes. He decided to offer shoe shine service as well, due to the reluctance of some customers to let go of 2 cents for a newspaper during hard (depression) times. He would wake up at 4:30 a.m. to prepare for his paper route. He was a student at Hawthorne Junior High School and graduated from G.W. Brackenridge High School in San Antonio in 1942. A friend later helped him get a part-time job with the U.S. Post Office. He was enrolled in St. Mary University as a freshman when he received his draft notice. He was drafted in 1943 and honorably discharged in 1945. Quintanilla served in the South Pacific Theater in the 13th Air Force, 72nd Squadron, as a bombardier. He received a physics degree from St. Mary University in 1950. He decided to pursue a military career and was offered a commission of Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force in 1951. In 1954 he was a 1st Lt, in the USAFSS 6910th Security Group in Landsberg, Bavaria. He was in charge of a Radio Traffic Analysis Group. His wife, Eleanor, joined him on this tour. His troops had been trained in San Antonio and had enjoyed Mexican food. http://www.raymack.com/usaf/mex_christmas.html They recalled that his beautiful wife invited them to a Mexican Christmas dinner in 1954. In 1960, Quintanilla was stationed at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, New York. Quintanilla headed Project Blue Book from 1963 until its closure in 1970. Project Blue Book began in 1952; the Air Force announced Project Blue Book's closing on December 17, 1969, with its final day of operation on January 30, 1970. Quintanilla succeeded Lieutenant Colonel Robert Friend. He was selected to be the next Project Blue Book Officer by Colonel Eric T. de Jonckheere, who explained to Quintanilla that he was looking to fill the position with a man with a degree in physics, with maturity, drive, and a man who was cool under pressure; Quintanilla shook his head and felt he only met the physics degree requirement. Colonel Joncheere told Quintanilla to take the job for a few weeks and report back to him. Quintanilla felt he was offered the job due to his reluctance to take several other job offers in the escalating Vietnam War. Project Blue Book left a legacy of over 12,000 reported UFOs investigated of which 30 percent or over 4,000 cases, were classified as unknown. Lieutenant Colonel Quintanilla retired after Project Blue Book was closed. Sometime afterwards, he was injured in a golf cart accident, sustaining a head injury that affected his health in later years. He died May 18, 1998 in San Antonio, Texas. Quintanilla left behind six children ‚Äî Gene, Tessie, Karl, Nancy, Diane, and Bob ‚Äî and several grandchildren. Project Blue Book was often harshly criticizedJerome Clark, The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial, 1998; Detroit: Visible Ink Press, J. Allen Hynek; The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry; 1972; Henry Regenery Company by those who argued it was not properly investigating UFO reports and was prone to improbable and/or untested post hoc explanations. After Blue Book folded, Quintanilla wrote a memoir,UFO‚ÄôS: An Air Force Dilemma. https://archive.org/details/ufos-an-air-force-dilemma unpublished during his life and publicized in the 1990s by the National Institute for Discovery Science, which explained Quintanilla's perspective on Blue Book and UFOs.

Its use is almost completely restricted to the seven families (or groups) of fairies. As revealed in the fifth book, magic is another type of energy, like its counterparts kinetic energy and light energy (among others) It is subject (like every other type of energy) to the law that \\"Energy cannot be destroyed, only converted into another form.\\" When it is active, it is visible in the form of blue sparks.  Common Abilities  Some common abilities among the fairies are the Mesmer, shielding and healing. The Mesmer This is the ability to hypnotize humans, fairies, and possibly other creatures (although mesmerizing another fairy is illegal according to the fairy book); and is available to every fairy, even the ones most drained of magical energy.Artemis Fowl Some humans are more resilient to the Mesmer than others, and wearing a pair of mirrored sunglasses makes you unable to be mesmerized because the magic is reflected away. Shielding This is a bit of a misnomer, as it actually is simply a cloaking device (although it is not referred to like this in the series) When a fairy shields, they simply increase their heart rate to vibrate at such high speeds that the human eye cannot see them. However, only rats, two species of monkeys, and high-speed cameras can see through fairy shields. Additionally, Artemis Fowl II has been shown noticing the slight haze created by the vibration. Disadvantages include being unable to perform fine motor tasks, due to the intense vibrations, and they are still able to be heard. Healing This involves a fairy injecting magic into a wound (such as a scar or broken bone) and it being healed instantaneously. Even fatal wounds can be healed, but, as shown in Book III (The Eternity Code) It takes years off the victim's life.Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code  Demon Magic  Demons are another magical being in the Artemis Fowl series. While most are born without any magic, demon warlocks have a stronger and more potent magic than fairies. Transportation When humans started taking over above ground, a group of demon warlocks opted to lift their island, Hybras, and all the demons on it out of time as opposed to retreating underground with the other magical beings. Time Travel Demon No1 was able to send Holly and Artemis back in time to save his mother.  Human ability to use Magic  In the series so far Artemis Fowl II is the only human ever to possess the ability to control magic. This is because he stole some pure magic while traveling to the \\"timeless\\" place called Limbo, in which the land of Hybras, home to the seventh fairy family, the demons, is imprisoned.Artemis Fowl: The Lost Colony During the first few chapters of the sixth book, however, Artemis uses up all of his magic in attempting to heal a fairy illness that his mother has contracted.Artemis Fowl: The Time Paradox Unfortunately, the disease is the magical illness Spelltropy, as diagnosed by the centaur Foaly. Some humans are known to possess the Mesmer as it is the lowest form of magic. These humans may quite obviously be hypnotists or psychics.

It is an acoustic song about one of Bowie's early artist inspirations, the American pop artist Andy Warhol. The album track opens with a series of strange electronic tones which fades into studio chatter in which producer Ken Scott mispronounces Warhol's name and Bowie repeatedly demonstrates how to say it properly. Scott then solemnly reintroduces the take with the correct pronunciation, and Bowie asks if the tape is rolling. Upon realising he is indeed being recorded, Bowie bursts into laughter and the song proper begins. The song is memorable for a distinctive repeated riff played by Mick Ronson on acoustic guitar. Originally the song was written for Dana Gillespie, who recorded it in 1971, but her version of the song was not released until 1973 on her album Weren't Born a Man. Both versions feature Mick Ronson on guitar. Bowie, an admirer of Warhol, sent the artist an advanced copy of Hunky Dory and performed \\"Andy Warhol\\" for him in person at Warhol's The Factory in New York in September 1971, before the album had been released. But due to Warhol's typically minimal reaction, Bowie was never sure if he liked it or not.

Cordtz played a prominent role in national union affairs as Secretary-Treasurer. For example, he stood in for SEIU President John Sweeney and publicly opposed a proposed federal takeover of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in 1986 and again in 1987, even though federal control was designed to eliminate the influence of organized crime in the union.\\"AFL-CIO, UAW Join Teamsters In Opposing Proposed Government Takeover.\\" Associated Press.

The term can be construed as offensive, inoffensive, or completely neutral, largely depending on the region or country where it is used. It has various equivalents in other languages of Europe. In English A European map of West Africa, 1736. Included is the archaic mapping designation of Negroland. Around 1442, the Portuguese first arrived in Southern Africa while trying to find a sea route to India. The term ', literally meaning \\"black\\", was used by the Spanish and Portuguese as a simple description to refer to the Bantu peoples that they encountered. Negro denotes \\"black\\" in Spanish and Portuguese, derived from the Latin word niger, meaning black, which itself is probably from a Proto-Indo- European root *nekw-, \\"to be dark\\", akin to *nokw-, \\"night\\". \\"Negro\\" was also used of the peoples of West Africa in old maps labelled Negroland, an area stretching along the Niger River. From the 18th century to the late 1960s, negro (later capitalized) was considered to be the proper English-language term for people of black African origin. According to Oxford Dictionaries, use of the word \\"now seems out of date or even offensive in both British and US English\\". A specifically female form of the word, negress (sometimes capitalized), was occasionally used. However, like Jewess, it has all but completely fallen from use. \\"Negroid\\" has traditionally been used within physical anthropology to denote one of the three purported races of humankind, alongside Caucasoid and Mongoloid. The suffix -oid means \\"similar to\\". \\"Negroid\\" as a noun was used to designate a wider or more generalized category than Negro; as an adjective, it qualified a noun as in, for example, \\"negroid features\\". United States Prevalence of \\"negro\\" as a demonym has varied in American English. All-Negro Comics was a 1947 comic anthology written by African-American writers and featuring black characters. An emblem of the U.S. Negro league baseball. Negro superseded colored as the most polite word for African Americans at a time when black was considered more offensive.Nguyen, Elizabeth. \\"Origins of Black History Month,\\" Spartan Daily, Campus News. San Jose State University. 24 February 2004. Accessed 12 April 2008. In 17th- century Colonial America, the term \\"Negro\\" had been also, according to one historian, used to describe Native Americans. John Belton O'Neall's The Negro Law of South Carolina (1848) stipulated that \\"the term negro is confined to slave Africans, (the ancient Berbers) and their descendants. It does not embrace the free inhabitants of Africa, such as the Egyptians, Moors, or the negro Asiatics, such as the Lascars.\\" The American Negro Academy was founded in 1897, to support liberal arts education. Marcus Garvey used the word in the names of black nationalist and pan-Africanist organizations such as the Universal Negro Improvement Association (founded 1914), the Negro World (1918), the Negro Factories Corporation (1919), and the Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World (1920). W. E. B. Du Bois and Dr. Carter G. Woodson used it in the titles of their non-fiction books, The Negro (1915) and The Mis-Education of the Negro (1933) respectively. \\"Negro\\" was accepted as normal, both as exonym and endonym, until the late 1960s, after the later Civil Rights Movement. One well-known example is the identification by Martin Luther King, Jr. of his own race as \\"Negro\\" in his famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech of 1963. However, during the 1950s and 1960s, some black American leaders, notably Malcolm X, objected to the word Negro because they associated it with the long history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second class citizens, or worse.Smith, Tom W. (1992) \\"Changing racial labels: from 'Colored' to 'Negro' to 'Black' to 'African American'.\\" Public Opinion Quarterly 56(4):496‚Äì514 Malcolm X preferred Black to Negro, but also started using the term Afro- American after leaving the Nation of Islam.Liz Mazucci, \\"Going Back to Our Own: Interpreting Malcolm X‚Äôs Transition From 'Black Asiatic' to 'Afro- American'\\", Souls 7(1), 2005, pp. 66‚Äì83. Since the late 1960s, various other terms have been more widespread in popular usage. These include black, Black African, Afro-American (in use from the late 1960s to 1990) and African American.Christopher H. Foreman, The African-American predicament, Brookings Institution Press, 1999, p.99. Like many other similar words, the word \\"black\\", of Anglo-Saxon/Germanic origin, has a greater impact than \\"Negro\\", of French/Latinate origin (see Linguistic purism in English). The word Negro fell out of favor by the early 1970s. However, many older African Americans initially found the term black more offensive than Negro. The term Negro is still used in some historical contexts, such as the songs known as Negro spirituals, the Negro Leagues of sports in the early and mid-20th century, and organizations such as the United Negro College Fund. The academic journal published by Howard University since 1932 still bears the title Journal of Negro Education, but others have changed: e.g. the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (founded 1915) became the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History in 1973, and is now the Association for the Study of African American Life and History; its publication The Journal of Negro History became The Journal of African American History in 2001. Margo Jefferson titled her 2015 book Negroland: A Memoir to evoke growing up in the 1950s and 1960s in the African-American upper class. The United States Census Bureau included Negro on the 2010 Census, alongside Black and African- American, because some older black Americans still self-identify with the term.U.S. Census Bureau interactive form, Question 9. Accessed 7 January 2010. CBS New York Local News. Accessed 7 January 2010. The U.S. Census now uses the grouping \\"Black, African-American, or Negro\\". Negro is used in efforts to include older African Americans who more closely associate with the term. On the other hand, the term has been censored by some newspaper archives. Liberia The constitution of Liberia limits Liberian nationality to Negro people (see also Liberian nationality law). People of other racial origins, even if they have lived for many years in Liberia, are thus precluded from becoming citizens of the Republic. In other languages Latin America (Portuguese and Spanish) In Spanish, ' (feminine ') is most commonly used for the color black, but it can also be used to describe people with dark- colored skin. In Spain, Mexico, and almost all of Latin America, negro (lower- cased, as ethnonyms are generally not capitalized in Romance languages) means just 'black colour' and it doesn't refer by itself to any ethnic or race unless further context is provided. As in English, this Spanish word is often used figuratively and negatively, to mean 'irregular' or 'undesirable', as in ' ('black market'). However, in Spanish-speaking countries where there are fewer people of West African slave origin, such as Argentina and Uruguay, negro and negra are commonly used to refer to partners, close friends\\"negro\\" in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa√±ola or people in general, independent of skin color. In Venezuela the word negro is similarly used, despite its large West African slave-descended population percentage. In certain parts of Latin America, the usage of negro to directly address black people can be colloquial. It is important to understand that this is not similar to the use of the word nigga in English in urban hip hop subculture in the United States, given that \\"negro\\" is not a racist term. For example, one might say to a friend, \\" (literally 'Hey, black-one, how are you doing?'). In such a case, the diminutive ' can also be used, as a term of endearment meaning 'pal'/'buddy'/'friend'. ' has thus also come to be used to refer to a person of any ethnicity or color, and also can have a sentimental or romantic connotation similar to 'sweetheart' or 'dear' in English. In other Spanish- speaking South American countries, the word ' can also be employed in a roughly equivalent term-of-endearment form, though it is not usually considered to be as widespread as in Argentina or Uruguay (except perhaps in a limited regional or social context). It is consequently occasionally encountered, due to the influence of nigga, in Chicano English in the United States. In Portuguese, ' is an adjective for the color black, although ' is the most common antonym of ' ('white'). In Brazil and Portugal, ' is equivalent to ', but it is far less commonly used. In Portuguese-speaking Brazil, usage of \\"negro\\" heavily depends on the region. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, for example, where the main racial slur against black people is ' (literally 'creole', i.e. Americas-born person of West African slave descent), ' and ' can in very informal situations be used with the same sense of endearment as ' and ' in Spanish-speaking South America, but its usage changes in the nearby state of S√£o Paulo, where ' is considered an archaism and ' is the most-used equivalent of \\"negro\\"; thus any use of ' carries the risk of being deemed offensive. In Venezuela, particularly in cities like Maracaibo negro has a positive connotation and it is independent if the person saying it or receiving it is of black color or not. It is typically used to replace phrases like amor (Love), mam√° (Mother), amigo (Friend) and other similar ones. A couple could say negra (female form) or negro (male form) to the other person and ask for attention or help with no negative meaning whatsoever. Spanish East Indies \\"Negritos o Aetas\\" illustration in Bosquejo Geogr√°fico e Hist√≥rico-natural del Archipielago Filipino (Ram√≥n Jordana y Morera, 1885) In the Philippines, which historically had almost no contact with the Atlantic slave trade, the Spanish-derived term negro (feminine negra; also spelled nigro or nigra) is still commonly used to refer to black people, as well as to people with dark-colored skin (both native and foreign). Like in Spanish usage, it has no negative connotations when referring to black people. However, it can be mildly pejorative when referring to the skin color of other native Filipinos due to traditional beauty standards. The use of the term for the color black is restricted to Spanish phrases or nouns. Negrito (feminine negrita) is also a term used in the Philippines to refer to the various darker-skinned native ethnic groups that partially descended from early Australo-Melanesian migrations. These groups include the Aeta, Ati, Mamanwa, and the Batak, among others. Despite physical appearances, they all speak Austronesian languages and are genetically related to other Austronesian Filipinos. The island of Negros is named after them. The term Negrito has entered scientific usage in the English language based on the original Spanish/Filipino usage to refer to similar populations in South and Southeast Asia.Snow, Philip. The Star Raft: China's Encounter With Africa. Cornell Univ. Press, 1989 () However, the appropriateness of using the word to bundle people of similar physical appearances has been questioned as genetic evidence show they do not have close shared ancestry. Other Romance languages =Italian= In Italian, (male) and (female) were used as neutral term equivalents of \\"negro\\". In fact, Italian has three variants : \\"negro\\", \\"nero\\" and \\"di colore\\". The first one is the most historically attested and was the most commonly used until the 1960s as an equivalent of the English word negro. It was gradually felt as offensive during the 1970s and replaced with \\"nero\\" and \\"di colore\\". \\"Nero\\" was considered a better translation of the English word \\"black\\", while \\"di colore\\" is a loan translation of the English word \\"colored\\".Accademia della Crusca, Nero, negro e di colore, 12 ottobre 2012 [IT] Today, the word is currently considered offensive\\"'Negro'?

In the French language, the existential concept of ' ('blackness') was developed by the Senegalese politician L√©opold S√©dar Senghor. The word can still be used as a synonym of \\"sweetheart\\" in some traditional Louisiana French creole songs.Radio Canada, 1971, \\"Le Son des Fran√ßais d'Am√©rique #3 Les Cr√©oles, interview with Revon Reed The word ' as a racial term fell out of favor around the same time as its English equivalent negro. Its usage in French today (n√®gre litt√©raire) has shifted completely, to refer to a ghostwriter (√©crivain fant√¥me), i.e. one who writes a book on behalf of its nominal author, usually a non-literary celebrity. However, French Ministry of Culture guidelines (as well as other official entities of Francophone regionsE.g. \\"pr√™te-plume\\", Office Qu√©b√©cois de la Langue Fran√ßaise (Quebec Office for the French Language), 2012 (in French)) recommend the usage of alternative terms. =Haitian Creole= In Haitian Creole, the word ' (derived from the French ' referring to a dark-skinned man), can also be used for any man, regardless of skin color, roughly like the terms \\"guy\\" or \\"dude\\" in American English. Germanic languages The Dutch word ' was considered to be a neutral term, but since the start of the 21st century it is increasingly considered to be hurtful, condescending and/or discriminatory. The consensus among language advice services of the Flemish Government and Dutch Language Union is to use zwarte persoon/man/vrouw (black person/man/woman) to denote race instead.\\"Het n-woord\\". Ninsee In German, ' was considered to be a neutral term for black people, but gradually fell out of fashion since the 1970s in Western Germany, where ' is now mostly thought to be derogatory or racist. In the former German Democratic Republic, parallel to the situation in Russia, the term was not considered offensive.M√ºller, W. Abitur im Sozialismus, Sch√ºlernotitzen 1963-1967.

Heimkind - Neger - Pionier. Mein Leben. Rowohlt Verlag GmbH, Reinbek, 2005 In Denmark, usage of ' is up for debate. Linguists and others argue that the word has a historical racist legacy that makes it unsuitable for use today. Mainly older people use the word ' with the notion that it is a neutral word paralleling \\"negro\\". Relatively few young people use it, other than for provocative purposes in recognition that the word's acceptability has declined.Anne Ringgaard, Journalist. \\"Hvorfor m√• man ikke sige neger?\\". videnskab.dk. Retrieved on 2 January 2016. In Swedish and Norwegian, ' used to be considered a neutral equivalent to \\"negro\\". However, the term gradually fell out of favor between the late 1960s and 1990s. Elsewhere In the Finnish language the word ' (cognate with negro) was long considered a neutral equivalent for \\"negro\\". In 2002, neekeri's usage notes in the Kielitoimiston sanakirja shifted from \\"perceived as derogatory by some\\" to \\"generally derogatory\\". The name of a popular Finnish brand of chocolate- coated marshmallow treats was changed by the manufacturers from ' (lit. 'negro's kiss', like the German version) to ' ('Brunberg's kiss') in 2001. A study conducted among native Finns found that 90% of research subjects considered the terms ' and ' among the most derogatory epithets for ethnic minorities. In Turkish, ' is the closest equivalent to \\"negro\\". The appellation was derived from the Arabic zanj for Bantu peoples. It is usually used without any negative connotation. In Hungarian, ' (possibly derived from its German equivalent) is still considered to be the most neutral equivalent of \\"negro\\".See Hungarian sources at the related Hungarian Wikipedia article In Russia, the term (negr) was commonly used in the Soviet period without any negative connotation, and its use continues in this neutral sense. In modern Russian media, negr is used somewhat less frequently. Chyorny as an adjective is also used in a neutral sense, and conveys the same meaning as negr, as in (chyornye amerikantsy, \\"black Americans\\"). Other alternatives to negr are —Ç–µ–º–Ω–æ–∫–æ–∂–∏–π (temnokozhy, \\"dark-skinned\\"), —á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–∫–æ–∂–∏–π (chernokozhy, \\"black- skinned\\"). These two are used as both nouns and adjectives.

Harlequin's Millions) (ru. \\"–ú–∏–ª–ª–∏–æ–Ω—ã –ê—Ä–ª–µ–∫–∏–Ω–∞\\", Milliony Arlekina) also known under the title Harlequinade (ru. \\"–ê—Ä–ª–µ–∫–∏–Ω–∞–¥–∞\\", Arlekinada) is a ballet comique in two acts and two tableaux with libretto and choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Riccardo Drigo. It was first presented at the Hermitage by the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia on . The ballet was given a second premiere with the same cast at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre on . Riccardo Drigo's score for Les Millions d'Arl√©quin was celebrated in its own right and was issued in piano reduction by the publisher Zimmermann in 1901. The S√©r√©nade from the first act of the ballet became a popular repertory piece that has been arranged for various instruments and published under several alternative titles such as Serenatina veneziana all'antica, Veneitian Serenade and Valse Boston among many others. In 1922 the S√©r√©nade was adapted into the song Notturno d'amour that went on to be recorded by many notable singers including the famous Italian tenor Beniamino Gigli, whose 1926 recording of the song became a worldwide hit. Marius Petipa's original two-act production has not been performed since 1927. To date there are two versions of the ballet that are performed. The first is a one-act redaction by the ballet master Fyodor Lopukhov that was originally staged for the Maly Theatre Ballet in 1933 under the title Arlekinada. Lopukhov's version is still performed by companies and particularly by schools primarily in Russia but also throughout the world. The second version that is performed with regularity is the choreographer George Balanchine's version, given under the title Harlequinade, originally staged for the New York City Ballet in 1965.  History  Ivan Vsevolozhsky took up the directorship of the Hermitage Museum in 1899, a post that required supervision over performances given at the museum's theatre. Vsevolozhsky commissioned Marius Petipa‚Äîthe renowned Premier ma√Ætre de ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres‚Äîto begin work on three short ballets to be given for performances attended by the Imperial Russian court for the 1900‚Äì1901 season. Petipa began crafting scenarios for these ballets, drawing on a variety of differing subjects. The libretto of the first ballet, titled Les Ruses d'amour (The Pranks of Love), was inspired by French rococo. The second libretto was arranged for a ballet titled Les Saisons (The Seasons), being a plot-less ballet divertissement that represented the four seasons through Petipa's classical formula of danced tableaux. The third ballet was Les Millions d'Arlequin (Harlequin's Millions), with a libretto based on episodes featuring the stock characters from the Italian Commedia dell'arte. Petipa and Vsevolozhsky's original intentions were to commission the score for Les Millions d'Arlequin from Alexander Glazunov, while Riccardo Drigo was to compose the score for Les Saisons. The composers were close friends, and soon developed an affinity for their colleague's assigned ballet. Glazunov adamantly expressed to Petipa and Vsevolozhsky that the subject of Les Millions d'Arl√©quin was perfect in every respect for the Italian composer's talents. In the end Glazunov was commissioned to compose the scores for the one-act ballets Les Saisons and Les Ruses d'amour, while Drigo was commissioned to compose the score for the two-act ballet Les Millions d'Arl√©quin.

St. Petersburg, ca. 1905 Julia Sedova as Columbine in Les millions d'Arlequin in her costume for the Polonaise of Act II. St. Petersburg, ca. 1905 While working on the score for Les Millions d'Arl√©quin, Drigo took daily walks through the St. Petersburg Summer Garden and along the banks of the Neva River, all the while thinking of his native Italy. During one such walk, Drigo composed the ballet's famous \\"S√©r√©nade\\", which included a solo mandolin, and the Berceuse: Variation pour Columbine, which was written especially for the harpist Albert Zabel. Les Millions d'Arl√©quin was first presented at the Hermitage on with a cast that included Mathilde Kschessinskaya as Columbine, Georgy Kyaksht as Harlequin, Olga Preobrajenskaya as Pierrette, Sergei Lukianov as Pierrot, and Enrico Cecchetti as Cassandre. The first performance was given for a private audience consisting of the whole of the Imperial Russian court as well as the Emperor Nicholas II, the Empress Alexandra, and the Dowager Empress Maria. Private royal theatrical performances of that time were extremely formal affairs where rigid etiquette and protocol were strictly adhered to, and as such applause or cheering were not permitted. Nevertheless, within moments of the final curtain the typically subdued royal audience erupted into thunderous applause. The ballet master Petipa and the entire cast received a tumultuous ovation as they took their bows before the curtain. But much to the surprise of everyone present, the composer Drigo received such a reception that he was mobbed by several princes and Grand Dukes who tripped over one another in their enthusiasm to congratulate him for his music. The Empress Alexandra was also delighted with the ballet, and commanded two additional court performances on the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre, the first being given on . Marius Petipa staged some of his most memorable choreography for the principal ballerina roles of Columbine and Pierrette, with the role of Columbine becoming popular with the great ballerinas of the old Imperial stage, among them Anna Pavlova, Olga Preobrajenskaya and Julia Sedova. Petipa arranged challenging virtuoso choreography for the character Harlequin, a role that would go on to become one of the most coveted parts for the male dancer in Russia, with many of the Imperial Ballet's principal male dancers distinguishing themselves in it. Les Millions d'Arl√©quin was performed on over fifty occasions before the 1917 revolution. It was given sporadically thereafter, with its final performance in Petipa's production being given at the former Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in 1927. The ballet was never again included in the company's repertory. Later productions The ballet master Fyodor Lopukhov re-staged Les Millions d'Arl√©quin as Arlekinada in 1933 in a one-act redaction for the newly formed Maly Theatre Ballet of Leningrad. The production included costumes and d√©cor designed by the artist Tatiana Bruni. The premiere on 6 June 1933 was the company's first performance as the Maly Theatre's official dance troupe. Lopukhov's production of Arlekinada was performed by the company consistently until the 1990s, and was even filmed on two occasions. The first was produced by the BBC in 1978 for their program \\"An Evening With the Russian Ballet\\", and the second was produced by Gosteleradio for Russian television in 1991 when the Maly Theatre Ballet gave a rare performance of Arlekinada at the Mariinsky Theatre. Lopukhov's one-act version of the ballet is still occasionally performed by companies and especially by schools not only in Russia but throughout the world. In honor of the 65th anniversary of Les Millions d'Arl√©quin, George Balanchine staged an important revival of the work for the New York City Ballet under the title Harlequinade. This production premiered at the New York State Theater in New York City on 4 February 1965 with Patricia McBride as Columbine, Edward Villella as Harlequin, Suki Schorer as Pierrette and Deni Lamont as Pierrot. The New York City Ballet still perform Harlequinade consistently to the present day. Publication of the music After the premiere of Les Millions d'Arl√©quin in 1900, plans were underway by the music publisher Zimmermann to issue Riccardo Drigo's score in both piano reduction and orchestral partition. Riccardo Drigo recounts in his memoirs of how his colleagues urged the composer to dedicate his score to the Empress Alexandra. This required the composer to submit a request for the dedication to the Minister of the Imperial Court, which brought about a lengthy correspondence by a commission set up to investigate whether or not the composer's character and background were worthy of his offering a dedication to a Russian Empress. In the end the response was favorable and the dedication was graciously accepted.  The \\"S√©r√©nade\\"  The first act of Les Millions d'Arl√©quin featured a scene where the character Columbine appears on the balcony of her house and is serenaded from the street by the character Harlequin with his prop mandolin (though a prop guitar was also used in subsequent performances). Drigo's music for this scene became popular in its own right and was published separately in arrangements for various instruments. The S√©r√©nade would go on to become a staple of salon music during the Edwardian era and the inter-war period, and was even issued by music publishers under several alternate titles including Valse Boston or Serenatina veneziana (Venetian Serenade). The S√©r√©nade was among the pieces in the White Star Line songbook, and was played by the Musicians of the RMS Titanic. The S√©r√©nade was later adapted into the song Notturno d'amore by the lyricist S. Focacci in 1922. The Italian tenor Beniamino Gigli made a worldwide hit with his recording of the song in 1926. Notturno d'amore would go on to be recorded by many notable singers, while various adaptations of the S√©r√©nade have been recorded on countless occasions.

The smallest Natural Area in Pennsylvania, it is administered as part of Tuscarora State Forest. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in April 1967. Topography A path forms a loop around the site, which is located on the west side of a hill slope. Twenty- seven interpretive stations are located along the trail. In addition to the low growth of the box huckleberry itself, the hillside is covered with white pine and oak forest, with a scattering of other trees and various wildflowers. History The specimen of box huckleberry at the natural area has been estimated, based on its observed rate of growth and clonal reproduction, to be 1,200 to 1,300 years old, only a tenth of the estimated age for a nearby colony at Losh Run. The colony was discovered by Spencer Baird in 1845. No specimens of box huckleberry had been collected since 1805, and Baird's discovery allowed Asa Gray to classify the species as Gaylussacia brachycera. The resulting correspondence sparked a lifelong friendship between the two, and helped Baird attain a post at the Smithsonian Institution. The box huckleberry remained largely obscure until 1918, when Frederick V. Coville examined the site. On the basis of his observations there, he concluded that box huckleberry was self-sterile and spread clonally. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of plants from the site, Coville called attention to its plight with an article in Science. Renewed interest sparked the discovery of other box huckleberry colonies elsewhere in the Appalachians.

Organization Within the Rhode Island Army National Guard, the 43rd Military Police Brigade commands the 118th Military Police Battalion, to which the 115th and 169th Military Police companies are assigned. In addition, the brigade exercises administrative control over 1st Battalion, 103rd Field Artillery. The headquarters of the 43rd Military Police Brigade is located at the Warwick Armory in Warwick, Rhode Island. History The 43rd Military Police Brigade was constituted 4 March 1959 and allotted to the Rhode Island Army National Guard as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 103d Replacement Battalion. Organized and Federally recognized 1 April 1959 at Providence. Converted and redesignated 18 March 1963 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 43d Engineer Group. Converted and redesignated 1 May 1968 as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 43d Military Police Brigade. Reorganized and redesignated 1 May 1976 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 43d Military Police Brigade. One of the next major state activations came in 1978. The \\"Blizzard of '78\\" crippled the state and forced all units to be called to duty from 6‚Äì16 February 1978. The 43rd organized traffic control to allow engineers to perform snow removal. MP's were stationed throughout the downtown area to prevent looting. There had not been a statewide call up since the \\"Hurricane of '38\\", thirty-nine years earlier. Prior to 1986, the 43rd MP Brigade had two subordinate Military Police Battalions - the 118th and the 243rd. The 118th MP Battalion had the 115th and 119th MP companies assigned to it and the 243rd had the 169th and 1111th MP companies assigned to it. In 1986, the 243rd MP Battalion and the 1111th MP Company were deactivated with the 169th MP Company being transferred to the 118th MP Battalion. Other units under the 43d MP Brigade were the 1207th Transportation Company and Company D, 280th Signal Battalion (from 1986 until its deactivation in 1993). Global War on Terror Soldiers from the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 43rd Military Police Brigade, mobilized in April 2002, then deployed from Fort Dix, New Jersey, in May 2002 to the US Naval Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The brigade was under the command of Brigadier General Richard Baccus. There they replaced the 89th Military Police Brigade as the new headquarters element for Joint Task Force ‚Äì 160 (JTF-160). In early 2002, the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) established JTF-160 and JTF-170 to operate a detention and interrogation facility at the naval base. In November of the same year, the two task forces consolidated to become Joint Task Force ‚Äì Guantanamo (JTF- GTMO). During this period, US military personnel from all five services planned and executed a mission to safely and humanely detain suspected terrorists. Soldiers redeployed in November/December 2002 and demobilized in January 2003. On 28 January 2003, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award (JMUA) to Headquarters, JTF-160, for exceptionally meritorious achievement during the period 4 January ‚Äì 31 October 2002. Operation Iraqi Freedom Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 43rd Military Police Brigade, was mobilized in August 2005, and deployed to Iraq under the command of Brigadier General Kevin R. McBride. The mission was to provide Command and Control (C2) for all Theater Internment Facilities (TIFs) in support of Joint Task Force 134 and Multi-National Force ‚Äì Iraq. Additionally the brigade managed the training and integration of Iraqi Corrections Officers and initiated the transfer of authority for all TIF's to the government of Iraq in support of UNSCR 1546. While deployed, the brigade commanded five MP battalions, twenty-three companies, two brigade liaison detachments, and two coalition forces detachments totaling approximately 5,000 assigned soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coalition forces at five separate detention facilities throughout the country. The 43rd oversaw the closure of the Abu Ghraib TIF, officially named the Baghdad Correctional Custody Facility (BCCF), in July 2006, built a new detention facility at Camp Cropper, and expanded Camp Bucca making it the largest detention facility in the world. The 43rd MP Bde was also responsible for the development of the Iraqi Corrections Officer (ICO) Academy, which trained over 1600 Iraqi Correction Officers. The 43rd Military Police Brigade was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation for \\"Exceptionally Meritorious Service\\" during combat operations. Operation Enduring Freedom Soldiers from the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 43rd Military Police Brigade, mobilized in March 2011, deploying to Afghanistan under the command of Brigadier General Charles Petrarca. The unit had control of detention operations along with the Afghan National Police at Bagram Airbase. They returned home to Rhode Island on 7 March 2012. In October 2012 elements of the 43rd MP Brigade were mobilized following Superstorm Sandy to conduct security and traffic control operations. In early 2017, about 60 personnel from the Headquarters Company of the 43d MP Brigade deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to provide staffing for the headquarters element of Joint Task Force Guantanamo. Shoulder Sleeve Insignia The shoulder sleeve insignia was approved on 16 May 1969, consisting of a green shield with a yellow wall of two crenelles above three green wavy bars, issuing from base and surmounted overall a white pike all within a yellow border. The fortification above the wavy bars alludes to the wall surrounding the 15th century city of Rhodes, capital of the Island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean after which Rhode Island was named. The wavy bars also represent Narragansett Bay and the many waterways of the state. The pike, any early weapon used by guards symbolizes the 43d Military Police Brigade's ability to give protection and strong support.

(2012). Dictionary.com. Retrieved September 3, 2012, from link.) is an outdated historical grouping of various people indigenous to East Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, North Asia, Polynesia, and the Americas. The concept of dividing humankind into three races called Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid was introduced in the 1780s by members of the G√∂ttingen School of History and further developed by Western scholars in the context of \\"racist ideologies\\" during the age of colonialism. With the rise of modern genetics, the concept of distinct human races in a biological sense has become obsolete. In 2019, the American Association of Physical Anthropologists stated: \\"The belief in 'races' as natural aspects of human biology, and the structures of inequality (racism) that emerge from such beliefs, are among the most damaging elements in the human experience both today and in the past.\\" The term Mongoloid has had a second usage referencing Down syndrome, now generally regarded as highly offensive.Keevak, Michael. \\"Becoming Yellow: A Short History of Racial Thinking\\". Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011. . Those affected were often referred to as \\"Mongoloids\\" or in terms of \\"Mongolian idiocy\\" or \\"Mongolian imbecility\\".  History of the concept   Origins  Mongolian as a term for race was first introduced in 1785 by Christoph Meiners, a scholar at the then modern G√∂ttingen University. Meiners divided humanity into two races he labeled \\"Tartar-Caucasians\\" and \\"Mongolians\\", believing the former to be beautiful, the latter to be \\"weak in body and spirit, bad, and lacking in virtue\\". His more influential G√∂ttingen colleague Johann Friedrich Blumenbach borrowed the term Mongolian for his division of mankind into five races in the revised 1795 edition of his De generis humani varietate nativa (On the Natural Variety of Mankind). Although Blumenbach's concept of five races later gave rise to scientific racism, his arguments were basically anti-racist, since he underlined that mankind as a whole forms one single species, and points out that the transition from one race to another is so gradual that the distinctions between the races presented by him are \\"very arbitrary\\".German: \\"sehr willk√ºrlich\\": In Blumenbach's concept, the Mongolian race comprises the peoples living in Asia east of the Ob River, the Caspian Sea and the Ganges River, with the exception of the Malays, who form a race of their own in his concept. Of peoples living outside Asia, he includes the \\"Eskimos\\" in northern America and the European Finns, among whom he includes the \\"Lapps\\".  In the context of scientific racism  Huxley's map of racial categories from On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind (1870)Huxley, T. H. On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind (1870) Journal of the Ethnological Society of London. Huxley indicates that he has omitted certain areas with complex ethnic compositions that do not fit into his racial paradigm, including much of the Indian subcontinent and Horn of Africa. (Huxley, Thomas (1873). Critiques and Addresses by Thomas Henry Huxley, LL.D., F.R.S. Macmillan and Company. p. 153.) By the late nineteenth century, his Xanthochroi group had been redefined as the Nordic race, whereas his Melanochroi became the Mediterranean race. As such, Huxley's Melanochroi eventually also comprised various other dark Caucasoid populations, including the Hamites and Moors. (Gregory, John Walter (1931). Race as a Political Factor. Watts & Company. p. 19. Retrieved 8 May 2016.) Discussions on race among Western scholars during the 19th century took place against the background of the debate between monogenists and polygenists, the former arguing for a single origin of all mankind, the latter holding that each human race had a specific origin. Monogenists based their arguments either on a literal interpretation of the biblical story of Adam and Eve or on secular research. Since polygenism stressed the perceived differences, it was popular among white supremacists, especially slaveholders in the US.Ibram X. Kendi, Stamped from the Beginning. The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, New York: Nation Books 2016. , chapters 4, 7‚Äì12, 14, 16 passim. British biologist Thomas Huxley, a strong advocate of Darwinism and a monogenist, presented the views of polygenists in 1865: \\"[S]ome imagine their assumed species of mankind were created where we find them... the Mongolians from the Orangs\\".Huxley, Thomas. Collected Essays of Thomas Huxley: Man's Place in Nature and Other Kessinger Publishing: Montana, 2005. p.247. During the 19th century, diverging opinions were pronounced whether native Americans or Malays should be included in the grouping which was sometimes called \\"Mongolian\\" and sometimes \\"Mongoloid\\". For example, D. M. Warren in 1856 used a narrow definition which did not include either the \\"Malay\\" or the \\"American\\" races,Warren, D.M. (1856). A System of Physical Geography. Philadelphia: H. Cowperthwait & Co. p. 77. while Huxley (1870) and Alexander Winchell (1881) included both Malays and indigenous Americans.Winchell, A. (1881). Preadamites; or A Demonstration of the Existence of Men Before Adam; (3rd ed.). Chicago: S.C. Griggs and Company; London: Trubner & Co. pp. 57, 66. In 1861, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire added the Australian as a secondary race (subrace) of the principal race of Mongolian.Deniker, Joseph. The Races of Man: An Outline of Anthropology and Ethnography C. Scribner's Sons: New York, 1900, p.282 In his Essai sur l'in√©galit√© des races humaines (Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, published 1853‚Äì55), which would later influence Adolf Hitler, the French aristocrat Arthur de Gobineau defined three races which he called \\"white\\", \\"black\\", and \\"yellow\\". His \\"yellow race\\", corresponding to other writers' \\"Mongoloid race\\", consisted of \\"the Altaic, Mongol, Finnish and Tartar branches\\".DiPiero, Thomas. White Men Aren't gid/s work Duke University Press, 2002, p.8 While he saw the \\"white race\\" as superior, he claimed that the \\"yellow race\\" was physically and intellectually mediocre but had an extremely strong materialism that allowed them to achieve certain results. According to the Meyers Konversations-Lexikon (1885‚Äì90), peoples included in the Mongoloid race are North Mongol, Chinese & Indochinese, Japanese & Korean, Tibetan & Burmese, Malay, Polynesian, Maori, Micronesian, Eskimo, and Native American.Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, 4th edition, 1885‚Äì90. In 1909, a map published based on racial classifications in South Asia conceived by Herbert Hope Risley classified inhabitants of Bengal and parts of Odisha as Mongolo-Dravidians, people of mixed Mongoloid and Dravidian origin. Similarly in 1904, Ponnambalam Arunachalam claimed the Sinhalese people of Sri Lanka were a people of mixed Mongolian and Malay racial origins as well as Indo-Aryan, Dravidian and Vedda origins.http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2097/32648/StefanSchubert2016.pdf?sequence=1 Howard S. Stoudt in The Physical Anthropology of Ceylon (1961) and Carleton S. Coon in The Living Races of Man (1966) classified the Sinhalese as partly Mongoloid. German physical anthropologist Egon Freiherr von Eickstedt, an influential proponent of Rassenkunde (racial studies) in Nazi Germany, classified people from Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, East India, parts of Northeast India, western Myanmar and Sri Lanka as East Brachid, referring to people of mixed Indid and South Mongolid origins. Eickstedt also classified the people of central Myanmar, Yunnan, southern Tibet, Thailand and parts of India as Palaungid deriving from the name of the Palaung people of Myanmar. He also classified the Burmese, Karen, Kachin, Shan, Sri Lankans, Tai, South Chinese, Munda and Juang, and others as having \\"mixed\\" with the Palaungid phenotype. Commenting on the situation of the United States in the early 20th century, Leonard Lieberman said that the notion of the whole world being composed of three distinct races, Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid, seemed credible because of the history of immigration to the United States with most immigrants coming from three areas, Southeast China, Northwest Europe, and West Africa. This made the point of view of three races appear to be \\"true, natural, and inescapable.\\" In 1950, UNESCO published their statement The Race Question. It condemned all forms of racism, naming \\"the doctrine of inequality of men and races\\"\\"The Race Question\\", UNESCO, 1950, 11pp among the causes of World War II and proposing to replace the term \\"race\\" with \\"ethnic groups\\" because \\"serious errors ... are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance\\". = Subraces according to Kroeber = Alfred L. Kroeber (1948), Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, referring to the racial classification of mankind on the basis of physical features, said that there are basically \\"three grand divisions.\\" Kroeber indicated that, within the three-part classification, the Mongoloid, the Negroid, and the Caucasian are the three \\"primary racial stocks of mankind.\\" Kroeber said that the following are the divisions of the Mongoloid stock: the \\"Mongolian proper of East Asia,\\" the \\"Malaysian of the East Indies,\\" and the \\"American Indian.\\" Kroeber alternatively referred to the divisions of the Mongoloid stock as the following: \\"Asiatic Mongoloids,\\" \\"Oceanic Mongoloids,\\" and \\"American Mongoloids.\\" Kroeber said that the differences among the three divisions of the Mongoloid stock are not very large. Kroeber said that the Malaysian and the American Indian are generalized type peoples while the Mongolian proper is the most extreme or pronounced form. Kroeber said that the original Mongoloid stock must be regarded as being more like the current Malaysians, the current American Indians, or an intermediate type between these two. Kroeber said that it is from these generalized type peoples, who kept more nearly the ancient type, that peoples such as the Chinese gradually diverged, who added the oblique eye, and a \\"certain generic refinement of physique.\\" Kroeber said that, according to most anthropometrists, the Eskimo is the most particularized sub-variety out of the American Mongoloids. Kroeber said that in the East Indies, and in particular the Philippines, there can at times be distinguished a less specifically Mongoloid strain, which has been called the \\"Proto-Malaysian,\\" and a more specifically Mongoloid strain, which has been called the \\"Deutero-Malaysian.\\" Kroeber said that Polynesians appear to have primary Mongoloid connections by way of the Malaysians. Kroeber said that the Mongoloid element of Polynesians is not a specialized Mongoloid. Kroeber said that the Mongoloid element in Polynesians appears to be larger than the definite Caucasian strain in Polynesians. Speaking of Polynesians, Kroeber said that there are locally possible minor Negroid absorptions, as the ancestral Polynesians had to pass by or through archipelagoes which are presently Papuo-Melanesian Negroid to get to the central Pacific.Kroeber, A.L.

Coon divided the species Homo sapiens into five groups: Besides the Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Australoid races, he posited two races among the indigenous populations of sub-Saharan Africa: The Capoid race in the south and the Congoid race. Coon's thesis was that Homo erectus had already been divided into five different races or subspecies. \\"Homo Erectus then evolved into Homo Sapiens not once but five times, as each subspecies, living in its own territory, passed a critical threshold from a more brutal to a more sapient state.\\"Cited according to The reference given there is to \\"Coon, Origin of the [sic] Races, 1963 [sic], p. 657\\". Since Coon followed the traditional methods of physical anthropology, relying on morphological characteristics, and not on the emerging genetics to classify humans, the debate over Origin of Races has been \\"viewed as the last gasp of an outdated scientific methodology that was soon to be supplanted.\\"For a criticism of Coon's relying on typology alone, see also:  Disproof by modern genetics  The fact that there are no sharp distinctions between the supposed racial groups had been observed by Blumenbach and later by Charles Darwin.\\"It may be doubted whether any character can be named which is distinctive of a race and is constant... they graduate into each other, and.. it is hardly possible to discover clear distinctive characters between them... As it is improbable that the numerous and unimportant points of resemblance between the several races of man in bodily structure and mental faculties (I do not here refer to similar customs) should all have been independently acquired, they must have been inherited from progenitors who had these same characters.\\", Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man p. 225 onwards With the availability of new data due to the development of modern genetics, the concept of races in a biological sense has become untenable. Problems of the concept include: It \\"is not useful or necessary in research\\", scientists are not able to agree on the definition of a certain proposed race, and they do not even agree on the number of races, with some proponents of the concept suggesting 300 or even more \\"races\\". Also, data are not reconcilable with the concept of a treelike evolution\\"Indeed, if a species has sufficient gene flow, there can be no evolutionary tree of populations, because there are no population splits...\\", Templeton, A. (2016). EVOLUTION AND NOTIONS OF HUMAN RACE. In Losos J. & Lenski R. (Eds.), How Evolution Shapes Our Lives: Essays on Biology and Society (p. 355). Princeton; Oxford: Princeton University Press. . nor with the concept of \\"biologically discrete, isolated, or static\\" populations.  Current scientific consensus  After discussing various criteria used in biology to define subspecies or races, Alan R. Templeton concludes in 2016: \\"[T]he answer to the question whether races exist in humans is clear and unambiguous: no.\\"Templeton, A. (2016). EVOLUTION AND NOTIONS OF HUMAN RACE.

That this view reflects the consensus among American anthropologists is stated in: See also:  Legal use of the concept in the United States  In 1858, the California State Legislature enacted the first bill of several that prohibited the attendance of \\"Negroes, Mongolians and Indians\\" from public schools.Burns, John F. & Orsi, Richard J.

In 1885, the California State Legislature amended its code to make separate schools for \\"children of Mongoloid or Chinese descent.\\" In 1911, the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization was using the term \\"Mongolic grand division,\\" not only to include Mongols, but \\"in the widest sense of all,\\" to include Malays, Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans. In 1911, the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization was placing all \\"East Indians,\\" a term which included the peoples of \\"India, Farther India, and Malaysia,\\" in the \\"Mongolic\\" grand division.Dillingham, William P. (1911). Reports of the Immigration Commission: Abstracts of Reports of the Immigration Commission. Washington: Government Printing Office. Pages 233 & 256\\\\. Google Books link. In 1985, Michael P. Malone of the FBI Laboratory said that the FBI Laboratory is in a good position for the examination of Mongoloid hairs, because it does most of the examinations for Alaska, which has a large Mongoloid population, and it conducts examinations for the majority of Indian reservations in the United States.Proceedings of the International Symposium on Forensic Hair Comparisons.

Features   General appearance  A drawing of a \\"Mongoloid\\" eye according to French anthropologist Joseph Deniker showing a Russian Kalmyk The last edition of the German encyclopedia Meyers Konversations-Lexikon (1971‚Äì79, 25 volumes) lists the following characteristics of the \\"Mongoloid\\" populations of Asia: \\"Flat face with a low nasal root, accentuated zygomatic arches, flat- lying eyelids (which are often slanting), thick, tight, dark hair, dark eyes, yellow-brownish skin, usually short, stocky build.\\"  Skull  In 2004, British anthropologist Caroline Wilkinson gave a description of \\"Mongoloid\\" skulls in her book on forensic facial reconstruction: \\"The Mongoloid skull shows a round head shape with a medium-width nasal aperture, rounded orbital margins, massive cheekbones, weak or absent canine fossae, moderate prognathism, absent brow ridges, simple cranial sutures, prominent zygomatic bones, broad, flat, tented nasal root, short nasal spine, shovel-shaped upper incisor teeth (scooped out behind), straight nasal profile, moderately wide palate shape, arched sagittal contour, wide facial breadth and a flatter face.\\"  Cold adaptation  In 1950, Carleton S. Coon, Stanley M. Garn, and Joseph B. Birdsell proposed that the relative flatness of \\"Mongoloid\\" faces was caused by adaption to the extreme cold of subarctic and arctic conditions. They supposed that \\"Mongoloid\\" eye sockets have been extended vertically to make room for adipose tissue around the eyeballs, and that the \\"reduced\\" brow ridges decrease the size of the air spaces inside of the brow ridges known as the frontal sinuses which are \\"vulnerable\\" to the cold. They also supposed that \\"Mongoloid\\" facial features reduce the surface area of the nose by having nasal bones that are flat against the face and having enlarged cheekbones that project forward which effectively reduce the external projection of the nose.Dahlberg, A.A. & Graber, T.M.

Steegmann showed that the so-called cold-adapted Mongoloid face provided no greater protection against frostbite than the facial structure of Europeans.  As a term for Down syndrome  \\"Mongoloid\\" has had a second usage, now generally avoided as highly offensive: until the late 20th century, people with Down syndrome were often referred to as \\"Mongoloids\\", or in terms of \\"Mongolian idiocy\\" or \\"Mongolian imbecility\\". The term was motivated by the observation that people with Down syndrome often have epicanthic folds. Coined in 1908, the term remained in medical usage until the 1950s. In 1961, its use was deprecated by a group of genetic experts in an article in The Lancet due to its \\"misleading connotations\\".\\"The importance of this anomaly among Europeans and their descendants is not related to the segregation of genes derived from Asians; its appearance among members of Asian populations suggests such ambiguous designations as 'Mongol Mongoloid'; increasing participation of Chinese and Japanese in investigation of the condition imposes on them the use of an embarrassing term. We urge, therefore, that the expressions which imply a racial aspect of the condition be no longer used. Some of the undersigned are inclined to replace the term Mongolism by such designations as 'Langdon Down Anomaly', or 'Down's Syndrome or Anomaly', or 'Congenital Acromicria'. Several of us believe that this is an appropriate time to introduce the term 'Trisomy 21 Anomaly', which would include cases of simple Trisomy as well as translocations. It is hoped that agreement on a specific phrase will soon crystallise once the term 'Mongolism' has been abandoned.\\" Allen, G. Benda C.J. et al (1961). Lancet corr. 1, 775. The term continued to be used as a pejorative in the second half of the 20th century, with shortened versions such as Mong in slang usage. In the 21st century this usage of the term is deemed \\"unacceptable\\" in the English-speaking world and has fallen out of common use because of its offensive and misleading implications about those with the disorder. The terminology change was brought about both by scientific and medical experts as well as people of Asian ancestry, including those from Mongolia.

It is native to the east-central United States (Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee).Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map Gaylussacia brachycera is easily distinguished from other members of its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of boxwood (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped flowers in the early summer, which develop to blue, edible berries in late summer. It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there were known to natives, who picked and ate the berries, before botanists became aware of them in the 1920s. A relict species nearly exterminated by the last ice age, box huckleberry is self-sterile, and is found in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots. One colony in Pennsylvania was once estimated to be as many as 13,000 years old; more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8,000 years, which would make it the oldest woody plant east of the Rocky Mountains. Another colony in Pennsylvania, about 1,300 years old, has been protected by the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area. Description Box huckleberry is a low shrub, tall. Its leaves resemble those of boxwood (hence its name). About long and oval-shaped, they are glossy and minutely toothed, turning red in winter. The evergreen leaves, lacking resin glands, are in sharp contrast to other species of Gaylussacia. Box huckleberry flowers in May and June. The flowers are urn-shaped and white, sometimes tinged with pink. Like other huckleberries, the flowers appear on a raceme springing from the leaf axils. Its fruits, which appear in July and August, are blue berries borne on short pedicels.Flora of North America, Gaylussacia brachycera (Michaux) A.Gray, 1846. Box huckleberry Taxonomy Box huckleberry was first collected and described in 1796 near Winchester, Virginia (probably in what is now West Virginia) by the botanist Andr√© Michaux. Michaux named it Vaccinium brachycerum in his Flora Boreali-Americana, published in 1803. Matthias Kinn, in about 1800, and Frederick Pursh, in 1805, also obtained specimens in West Virginia. R. A. Salisbury referred to it as V. buxifolium in 1805, and this remained the prevailing name for the next forty years; the common name \\"box- leaved whortle-berry\\" was used for the species at the time. No further specimens were collected until 1845, when Spencer Baird, a professor at Dickinson College, discovered a colony near New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania. It was redesignated G. brachycera in 1846 by Asa Gray on the basis of Baird's specimens. (Gaylussacia was not recognized as a genus separate from Vaccinium until 1819.) The discovery brought about a friendship between Gray and Baird that ultimately resulted in the latter's appointment as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. John Kunkel Small assigned the species, as Buxella brachycera, to a monospecific genus in 1933. However, this was not widely accepted, and was rejected by other authors on the grounds of both nomenclatural and \\"phyletic unsoundness\\". More recently, phylogenetic studies in 2002 suggested that the monophyly of G. brachycera with the remainder of Gaylussacia is \\"equivocal\\", and further analysis of Vaccinium might result in G. brachycera being returned to that genus. Distribution and habitat About 100 separate stations for box huckleberry have been documented in the scientific literature. By the time of Baird's collection in 1845, the West Virginia stations of the plant had been lost to science, and his Pennsylvania colony was the only one known for some time. Specimens of box huckleberry were subsequently identified in Delaware in 1870, by William M. Canby. In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called attention to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony. This report stimulated considerable interest in the species. Additional colonies were located in Pennsylvania and Delaware, one in Maryland, several in Virginia, three in Tennessee (1920‚Äì1930), two in Kentucky (1927‚Äì1932), and many in West Virginia (1921). In summarizing these discoveries in 1932, Wherry noted that many of the colonies were already known to local residents, who picked the berries for food, under names such as \\"juniper-berry\\", \\"ground-huckleberry\\", and \\"bear-huckleberry\\". He called for more intensive effort on the part of the scientific community to make use of such local knowledge in determining plant geography. More recently, a colony of box huckleberry was discovered in Durham County, North Carolina, the first report from that state, in 2003. Most of the reported stations for box huckleberry fall within the Appalachian Mountains, ranging from central Pennsylvania in the north to eastern Tennessee in the south. However, the specimens located in Maryland and Delaware were found on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, and the single North Carolina station is in the Piedmont. Its scattered distribution suggests that the species once spread more broadly across North America, but was almost eradicated by glacial advances, surviving only where it escaped the ice in protected refugia. Box huckleberry prefers dry, acidic soils, including duff, and partial shade. Locations on wooded slopes tend to face north; however, the New Bloomfield site faces west. At one of the Delaware sites, a small portion of the colony extended to the wet margin of a marsh, but most was located on dry, sandy soil upslope. Ecology and human use Box huckleberry is self-sterile, so single plants cannot reproduce sexually. Instead, they form colonies which spread by vegetative reproduction along rootstocks. A colony of G. brachycera at Losh Run, Pennsylvania was found to be long when surveyed. If this colony grew clonally from a seed deposited along the Juniata River at the rate of per year, it would be about 13,000 years old, the oldest living organism in the United States and second oldest in the world, eclipsed only by Lomatia tasmanica. However, this is believed now to be an overestimate on climatic grounds. At that time, the site was covered by a boreal forest thought to be too cold for the box huckleberry to survive; the current forest did not begin to appear at the site until about 8,000 years ago. This age would still make it the oldest woody plant in North America east of the Rocky Mountains. Recent studies have attempted to determine whether, in fact, the reproduction of the colony (since heavily damaged by a forest fire in 1963 and road construction in the 1970s) has been entirely clonal. Two genotypes were found in samples taken from the colony, but they are thought to have arisen through somatic mutation rather than sexual reproduction. Unfortunately, the destruction of about 80% of the colony by fire and construction makes it impossible to definitively settle the question. The caterpillar of the moth Dichomeris juncidella has been reported to feed on the leaves. The berries are eaten by wild turkeys and ruffed grouse. They have been harvested for food by humans in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Rev. Frederick W. Gray, who documented many of the box huckleberry colonies in West Virginia in the 1920s, first took an interest in the plant when served a \\"juniper\\" pie, \\"juniper\\" being the local name for box huckleberry. However, they are reportedly tasteless. With the cooperation of the United States Department of Agriculture, efforts are under way to promote G. brachycera as a groundcover for use in landscaping. Box huckleberry is commercially available from at least one source but it is difficult to propagate, making it unprofitable for many nurseries to carry. It is commonly marketed as 'Berried Treasure‚Ñ¢' (the trademark symbol is not always present), and while the name gives the impression of being a cultivar, it is simply a propagate of the wild colony. Briggs Nursery has developed a treasure chest logo and stylized title to accompany its marketing material for the plant. In New Bloomfield, PA, the box huckleberry has become part of the local New Year's celebrations, as a papier-m√¢ch√© replica of a huckleberry is dropped, instead of a ball, to mark the new year.

Smith and Lawrence B. Slobodkin.Hairston NG, Smith FE, Slobodkin LB (1960) Community structure, population control and competition. American Naturalist 94:421-425 Nelson was also deeply interested in the factors that control human disease and was an adviser to the World Health Organization for many years.http://www.cnah.org/news.asp?id=448 Early life Nelson was born on October 16, 1917 in the Cooleemee area of Davie County, North Carolina. He was the second of two boys to Margaret George Hairston (1884-1963) and Peter Hairston (1841-1975). The Hairstons owned plantations all around Henry County, Virginia, Pittsylvania County, Virginia, Franklin County, Virginia, North Carolina, and Lowndes County, Mississippi. He was born on the Cooleemee Plantation, which was built by his grandfather, Peter Wilson Hairston (1819-1886). Early career Nelson was interested in ecology from an early age. He graduated from the department of Zoology at the University of North Carolina with both a BS and MS. Hairston continued his studies at Northwestern University under the supervision of Dr. Orlando Park. His PhD was interrupted by World War II, where he served his country by helping treat and prevent the transmission of malaria in the South Pacific. After the war, Nelson returned to his PhD, which was on the distribution of salamanders in Appalachia. These early experiences with studying the ecology of salamanders and the treatment of disease began his lifelong interest in the ecology and prevention of disease. Academic work  Professor of Zoology  Hairston spent most of his career (27 years) as a professor of Zoology at the University of Michigan and director of their Museum of Zoology. During this time Nelson helped to make the University of Michigan one of the United States preeminent graduate programs in ecology. Afterwards he spent 12 years as a professor at the University of North Carolina as a Kenan Professor of Biology, where he advised students including evolutionary biologist Richard Lenski. Throughout Hairston‚Äôs career, he focused most of his work on the role trophic interactions, such as the trophic cascade, has on determining the species composition of communities of co-existing organisms.Hairston NG Jr, and Hairston NG Sr. (1997) Does food web complexity eliminate trophic-level dynamics? American Naturalist 149: 1001-1007  Adviser to the UN‚Äôs World Health Organization  Hairston‚Äôs work on human disease was equally controversial. Nelson, along with a handful of other colleagues, championed the idea that disease was an ecological problem that could be solved by understanding the ecology of germs and how we interact with our ecosystems. This once controversial view is now well accepted by epidemiologists and others in the health profession. Hairston‚Äôs views on disease treatment and management were applied through the UN‚Äôs World Health Organization, where he served as an adviser on schistosomiasis in countries throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the South Pacific. Retirement Hairston retired at the age of 69. Despite retiring, Hairston remained an active and engaged scientist. Post retirement he published three books, including, ‚ÄúEcological Experiments‚Äù, which was translated into several different languages.

Ghana is located on the Gulf of Guinea, only a few degrees north of the Equator, giving it a warm climate., Climatology The climate of Ghana is tropical and there are two main seasons: the wet and the dry seasons. North Ghana experiences its rainy season from April to mid- October while South Ghana experiences its rainy season from March to mid- November. The tropical climate of Ghana is relatively mild for its latitude. The harmattan, a dry desert wind, blows in north-east Ghana from December to March, lowering the humidity and causing hotter days and cooler nights in northern part of Ghana. Average daily temperatures range from 30¬∞C (86¬∞F) during the day to 24¬∞C (75¬∞F) at night with a relative humidity between 77 percent and 85 percent.

Bosko arrives and his horse collapses in a heap beside the pavement. Strolling toward the saloon on the opposite side of the road, Bosko throws open the doors and yells \\"Howdy\\" only to be greeted by a volley of gunshots. The patrons yell \\"Hi Bosko\\" in return as Bosko laughs uneasily. He then picks up his bullet-riddled hat and walks inside where a three-piece band, comprising banjo, violin and piano, is playing \\"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\\". Bosko starts to tap dance whilst some onlookers sway to the beat. The piano player thumps hard on the keys which makes a mug of beer fly through the air and empty the contents into his open mouth. He gulps it down and is suddenly consumed by flames that spread upwards from his feet. This results in his clothes being burnt off, exposing bloomers. He puckers a suddenly lipsticked mouth, crosses his knees in a shyly feminine fashion and walks away seductively. Bosko steps up to the piano and starts to play, rocking his stool in tune to the music. Next, four cards are seen held in someone's hand: a King, Jack, Queen and Joker. They sing a little ditty but the person holding the cards soon shoots the Joker putting an end to their performance. Bosko is shown still playing the piano whilst the other patrons gather in a circle and start dancing. The scene then cuts to show the following words > The Deadwood stage > (free wheeling) > Honey (Bosko's sweetheart) is in a carriage that is hurtling down the highway with a big trunk on the roof. The ride is quite bumpy so Honey gets thrown around her seat a bit and exhorts the driver to be careful. A group of highwaymen are also on the move and one of them creep along behind a cliff to look for potential prey. He spots Honey's carriage and hastens back to his cronies who follow his lead. He then positions himself alongside the path of Honey's carriage and aims his guns. However, the carriage hurtles past at such a fast pace that the gunmen gets twisted around himself. Having unravelled he gets on his horse and gives chase along with his gang, all of them shooting non-stop. Eventually, the trunk on the roof of the carriage falls out and the clothes get out and start running away to avoid the hailstorm of bullets. A corset is seen literally 'flying' away. Inside the carriage Honey is getting thrown about violently as the driver is flung off his perch and lands on a tall cactus. He slides down wincing as hundreds of thorns break off and lands on a skeleton of a bull. The skeleton suddenly comes to life and goes off at a gallop whilst the rider hangs on for dear life. Back at the saloon, Bosko is still playing the piano when the driver stumbles in and relays the news. He then deflates and collapses dramatically into his pants as his hand grabs a mug of beer and pours it in after himself. Bosko gets on his horse and gallops away to the rescue, the horse leaping noticeably effortlessly over the rocks he seemed to have trouble with earlier. The bandits are still chasing the carriage and Honey leans out of a window and implores Bosko to save her. As Bosko continues to gallop after the run away carriage the scene pans out to show, from left to right, Hugh Harman, Friz Freleng, and Rudy Ising watching the cartoon and adding sound effects. Ising asks how they can get Bosko to save Honey, Freleng doesn't know, Ising says they have to do something, then Harman decides they should go home. This prompts everyone to exit, leaving Bosko in the lurch. Reception Steve Schneider's That's All, Folks! The Art of Warner Bros.

Background He was born 1933 in the eastern Anatolian city of Malatya, Turkey. He attended the Turkish Military Academy, finishing it in 1952 with the rank of lieutenant. In 1966, he graduated from the War Academy of the Army (). After completing a language course in Germany, Bitlis studied further at the Academy of the Turkish Armed Forces (), graduating in 1969. Later, he was educated at the F√ºhrungsakademie der Bundeswehr, the highest military academy of the German armed forces. He graduated in Germany in 1973. Career Following his graduation in Germany in 1973, Bitlis returned home and served one year as head teacher at the War Academy of the Army. In 1978, E≈üref Bitlis was promoted to Brigadier General and appointed commander of the 2nd Commando Brigade in Bolu, a mountain warfare specialized unit. After becoming a Major General in 1978, he assumed the command of the 28th Infantry Division, headquartered in the Pa≈üak√∂y village of Nicosia, Cyprus. In 1986, he advanced to the rank of a Lieutenant General. Bitlis was appointed commander of the Cyprus Turkish Peace Forces. Two years later in 1990, he became an Army General and General Commander of the Turkish Gendarmerie. General Commander of the Turkish Gendarmerie (1990 - 1993) As General Commander of the Turkish Gendarmerie, Bitlis supported the plans of President Turgut √ñzal to resolve the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict by peaceful means. A week before he died, Bitlis met the foreign ministers of Syria, Iran and Iraq to discuss √ñzal's peace plans. He was also investigating an issue which journalist Uƒüur Mumcu, assassinated in January 1993, had been, namely the funnelling of 100,000 rifles from Turkey to Kurdish armed forces in Iraq.Today's Zaman, 12 June 2011, Two retired generals to testify in Bitlis murder case The Turkish Daily News later interviewed an army general who said that the commander of the Joint United States Military Mission for Aid to Turkey (JUSMMAT) had complained about Bitlis to the chief of staff for collecting information about illegal activities pertaining to Operation Provide Comfort (OPC). Other OPC officers also complained to Washington. Bitlis aggressively opposed American designs; he had allegedly dismissed Americans supporting the Turkish Gendarmerie as well as CIA agents operating from humanitarian organizations active in the region. The interviewed general said that Bitlis had discovered arms intended for Jalal Talabani and Massoud Barzani concealed in crates purportedly containing food. According to another source, Bitlis was given photographs taken by JITEM operatives depicting three OPC helicopters distributing materiel to the PKK on 10 December 1992. Such acts led Bitlis to conclude that America was intent on establishing a Kurdish state encompassing Turkey. Bitlis proposed to solve the PKK conflict by severing its logistical support. To this end, he suggested establishing relations with neighboring countries.  Death  On February 17, 1993, a snowy day, Bitlis was on an official trip by plane from the G√ºvercinlik Army Air Base in Ankara. He switched airplanes when the pilot realized the cockpit was out of order. His Beechcraft Super King Air B-200 crashed minutes after taking off from the air base. Bitlis, his aide-de-camp Fahir I≈üƒ±k, technician Emir √ñner and the pilots, who had VIP green card certification for excellence in flying, died in the crash. The chief of staff, Gen. Doƒüan G√ºre≈ü, said the accident was due to atmospheric icing but this has been denied by the manufacturer and experts from Istanbul Technical University and Middle East Technical University. According to the Etimesgut Air Base Weather Department's weather report for that day, there was no ice accumulation: \\"Calm, windy, 1,500 meters visibility, snowy, low clouds affected. Cloud level 800 feet, peak 8,000 feet. The weather is completely overcast. The temperature is -4 degrees and the pressure is 1,018 milibars.\\" Alt URL The military prosecutor who initially investigated the incident, Col. Hasan T√ºys√ºzoƒülu, remained convinced twenty years later that the crash was due to sabotage, and said that the dossier was taken from him, and no further investigation deemed necessary.Today's Zaman, 10 August 2010, Former military prosecutor claims Bitlis‚Äô file incomplete Gendarmerie commander Cem Ersever, who had been in charge of the Jƒ∞TEM group's southeastern operations, left the army in mid-1993. He was allegedly in contact with the PKK through the Syrian intelligence service and the American special forces. Bitlis was fighting the PKK, and therefore on bad terms with Ersever. For this reason, some speculate that Ersever may have been responsible for Bitlis' death. Ersever himself was killed on 4 November 1993, along with his girlfriend Nevval Boz and right-hand man Mustafa Deniz, some suggest to cover up Bitlis' death. JITEM fugitive Abd√ºlkadir Aygan suspects Veli K√º√ß√ºk, who is currently detained in the Ergenekon investigation, of having ordered Ersever's death. Ersever was resentful towards K√º√ß√ºk of being shunted to Ankara after the scandal surrounding Bitlis' death, perceiving K√º√ß√ºk as taking the credit for his achievements. According to Arif Doƒüan, the plane crash was engineered by Ersever together with Mahmut Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m (Ye≈üil).Today's Zaman, 2 October 2010, Jƒ∞TEM Colonel Doƒüan gives details of E≈üref Bitlis‚Äô murder Journalist Metin Kaplan offers a polar opposite account. Kaplan says that Ersever and Bitlis were in fact close friends, who were killed by American agents, and that Mustafa Deniz is still alive. Kaplan thinks it unlikely that Ersever killed Bitlis considering their alleged closeness, and the fact that Ersever was poor; he allegedly received pocket money from his publisher. Kaplan says that a person tasked with carrying out an assassination for a foreign government would be well funded. Kaplan also says that the air base Bitlis departed from quartered two JUSMMAT planes, and two American technicians, who likely had access to Bitlis' plane. Ultimately, Kaplan concludes that the Turkish military was aware that the Americans did it, but covered it up to maintain good relations. Recently uncovered evidence suggests that his death and that of Mumcu may be related to the shadowy Ergenekon network.Bitlis is mentioned in the indictment's annex, see for example file 323 The authenticity of the evidence has been questioned. Both Bitlis and Mumcu were investigating how Jalal Talabani, one of the Kurdish leaders of northern Iraq, came into possession of 100,000 firearms belonging to the Turkish Armed Forces. However, the Ergenekon case is still in progress, and alternative explanations have been proffered to explain Mumcu's death (such as that Ersever did do it). He was survived by his spouse ≈û√ºkran and son Tarƒ±k.  Reopening of the death case  On September 30, 2010, the office of the chief public prosecutor in Ankara reopened the case relating to the death of Bitlis on the basis of some news recently published in the Turkish media. Prosecutor H√ºseyin G√∂r√º≈üen was tasked with the investigation to find out the cause of the 1993 plane crash. The military prosecutor at the Turkish General Staff, who was responsible for the crash investigation, had closed the file with the finding that Bitlis' airplane crash was an accident without any human involvement. However, serious allegations were made by suspects in the ongoing Ergenekon trial that the crash was an assassination. The case was due to be closed in February 2013 due to the 20-year statute of limitations,Today's Zaman, 17 February 2013, Statute of limitations claims unsolved E≈üref Bitlis murder case but in line with rulings from the European Court of Human Rights against statutes of limitations for murder, prosecutors said they would keep the case open.Today's Zaman, 17 March 2013, Prosecutor's office removes statute of limitations on unsolved murders , In September prosecutors issued a \\"permanent investigation\\" order.Today's Zaman, 22 September 2013, E≈üref Bitlis case will not be shut down under new order See also * \\"Castle Plan\\" () * Col.

The dog remained at the station, waiting for his master to return for the next five and a half years, until he was killed by an incoming train in 1942. History The dog once belonged to an unknown sheep herder near Fort Benton, Montana. When his owner became ill in August 1936, he went into St. Clare Hospital at Fort Benton for treatment, and brought his herding dog with him. A few days later he died, and his relatives back east sent for his body. The dog followed his casket to the railroad station and watched while it was being loaded on a train heading to the eastern USA. He would greet every train that arrived each day after that, expecting his master to return. It took station employees some time to realize that the body in the casket was probably the dog's master, and it was showing up for each incoming train to see if his master would be getting off. The dog was later given the name Shep and the station employees took care of him and he lived in and around the station, becoming well known to everyone who passed through. A few years into his time at the station, Shep and his story was featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not!. Shep kept this daily vigil for almost six years until he was run over by a train on January 12, 1942. It is believed that his front paws were on one of the rails and he simply did not hear the train until it was too late, and he slipped off the rail. The train's engineer could not stop the train in time. A few days later, Shep's funeral was attended by nearly everyone in Fort Benton. \\"Eulogy on the Dog\\", though written for another dog, was read at the funeral. Boy Scout Troop 47, who were the pallbearers and honor guard for Shep, helped carry his coffin to the dog‚Äôs grave on a lonely bluff, a hillside overlooking the town. The Great Northern Railroad put up a simple obelisk, with a painted wooden cutout of Shep next to it. Just beneath, white stones spelled out SHEP. Lights illuminated the display at night. The passenger line eventually stopped coming through Fort Benton, and the grave fell into disrepair. In 1988, the grave was repaired and refurbished. The Shep cutout is now painted steel, and lights are back up. The grave site is currently maintained by the Kiwanis Key Club and Fort Benton Community Improvement Society, and a small parking area and walking trail have been added behind the monument for easier access to the grave site. Shep's collar and bowl were put on display at Museum of the Upper Missouri, Fort Benton, Montana. Shep's story is retold as historical fiction in Shep Forever Faithful by Stewart H. Beveridge and Lee Nelson. Historical marker telling the tale of Shep, Fort Benton, Montana The folk song \\"Ol Shep\\", sung by Ramblin' Jack Elliott, is related but tells a different story.

Bjelland & Co A/S, Norway's largest canned goods producer and amongst the largest in Scandinavia. He became one of the great industrialists of his time and in 1908 was made a Knight, 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav for his contribution to building the Norwegian canning industry. Background Christian Bjelland was born on the farm √Öreskjold at H√∏yland in Rogaland, Norway. His parents were farmers who raised a family of six. In 1868, the family moved to Stavanger where Bjelland attended school in the neighborhood of Bjergsted. His formal education ended after fifth grade. Chr. Bjelland & Co A/S Nansen Brand. 1896. Nasjonalbiblioteket After several years as a trading officer and inspector in various manufacturing shops, he became engaged in foreign trade, especially consignment shipments of fish to England. During 1882, Bjelland founded an export business. The initial focus of the business was established in fresh salmon, trout and halibut. In 1889 Chr. Bjelland started processing anchovies in a tin can. In 1893 he picked up the production of sardines packed with a hermetic seal. The company became most famous for its sardines on tins featuring the images of notable Norwegians including explorer, Fridtjof Nansen. Particularly successful was the King Oscar brand for which Christian Bjelland received royal permission to use the image of Oscar II of Sweden . The King Oscar brand became well known worldwide and is still popular in the U.S.A. as well as Australia. Bjelland sardines have been an important part of Norwegian culture throughout the 19th and 20th century. The company slogans and advertising are still remembered by many Norwegians to this day. These include the company logo known as \\"The Man with the Fish\\" painted by Theodor Kittelsen, and the slogan Ikke noe snikk-snakk, Bjellands hermetikk, takk, which translates into \\"No chit-chat, Bjellands canned goods, thanks\\". The company was led by Christian Bjelland's son Ragnvald Bjelland (1886-1955), then by his sons Christian Wilhelm Bjelland (1913‚Äì84) and Frithjof Ragnvald Bjelland (1914-1983).

Boaro, 113 U.S. 527 (1885), was an action for the possession of a mining claim in Pioneer mining district, in the County of Dolores, and State of Colorado. The claim was designated by the plaintiff as \\"The Hawk Lode\\" mining claim, and by the defendants as \\"The Johnny Bull Lode\\" mining claim. It contains two counts. The first alleges that the right of possession of the claim by the plaintiff on June 17, 1880, is by virtue of its location pursuant to the laws of the United States and of the state, and the local rules and customs of miners in the district, and by virtue of priority of possession, the wrongful entry upon the premises by the defendants on the thirtieth of that month, their outing the plaintiff therefrom, and unlawfully withholding the possession from him, to his damage of $50,000. The second count, in addition to the citizenship of the parties, the possession of the claim by the plaintiff, and the subsequent wrongful entry of the defendants, and their ousting him, alleges that the defendants worked and mined in the claim, and dug out and removed from it large quantities of gold and silver bearing ore of the value of $50,000, to the damage of the plaintiff in that amount. The plaintiff therefore prays judgment for the possession of the mining premises and for damages of $100,000.Erhardt v. Boaro, . The answer of the defendants contains a specific denial of the several allegations of the complaint, and as to that it avers their want of information and demands proof. And it sets up the discovery of the claim in controversy on June 30, 1880, by the defendants Boaro and Hull, to which they gave the designation of \\"The Johnny Bull Lode,\\" and its definite location and record within ninety days thereafter, and their subsequent relocation of the claim September 8, 1880, to avoid a conflict with an adjoining claim. They pray therefore that they may be decreed its possession and ownership in accordance with their rights. In the trial, the plaintiff produced evidence showing that on June 17, 1880, one Thomas Carroll, a citizen of the United States, while searching, on behalf of himself and the plaintiff, also a citizen, for valuable deposits of mineral, discovered, on vacant unoccupied land of the public domain of the United States in the Pioneer mining district mentioned, the outcrop of a vein or lode of quartz and other rock bearing gold and silver in valuable and paying quantities; that by an agreement between him and the plaintiff, pursuant to which the explorations were prosecuted, all lodes and veins discovered by him were to be located, one-fifth in his name and four-fifths in the name of the plaintiff; that on the day of his discovery, Carroll designated the vein or lode as the \\"Hawk Lode,\\" and posted at the point of discovery a plain sign, or notice in writing, as follows: :HAWK LODE :We, the undersigned, claim 1,500 feet on this mineral-bearing lode, vein, or deposit. Dated June 17, 1880. :JOEL B. ERHARDT, 4/5ths :THOMAS CARROLL, 1/5th :that on the same day at the point of his discovery, Carroll commenced excavating a discovery shaft, and sank the same to the depth of about eighteen inches or two feet on the vein; that on the 30th of the month, in the temporary absence of himself and the plaintiff, the defendant Boaro, with knowledge of the rights and claims of the plaintiff and Carroll, entered upon and took possession of their excavation, removed and threw away or concealed the stake upon which their written notice was posted, and at the point of Carroll's discovery of the vein or lode, erected a stake and posted thereon a discovery and location notice as follows: ::JOHNNY BULL LODE ::We, the undersigned, claim 1,500 feet on this mineral-bearing vein or lode, running six hundred feet northeast and nine hundred feet southwest, and 150 feet on each side of the same, with all its dips and spurs, angles, and variations. ::June 30, 1880. ::ANTHONY BOARO ::W. L. HULL The evidence also showed that Boaro and Hull entered upon the premises on or about July 21, 1880, and remained thereafter continuously in possession; that threats of violence to the plaintiff and Carroll, if they should enter upon the premises or attempt to take possession of them, were communicated to Carroll as having been made by Boaro early in August following; that in consequence of such threats and the possession held by Boaro, Carroll was prevented from resuming work upon and completing the discovery shaft, and from entering upon any other part of the lode or vein and performing the acts of location required by law within the time limited. The evidence also tended to show that within ninety days from the discovery of the lode by Carroll, one French, on behalf of the plaintiff and Carroll, secretly caused the boundaries of the claim to be marked by six substantial posts, so as to include the place of discovery and the premises in controversy, and filed in the office of the recorder of the county a location certificate setting forth the name of the lode, the date of the location, the names of the plaintiff and Carroll as locators, and the course of the lode or vein, and giving such a description of the claim, with reference to natural objects and permanent landmarks, as would suffice to identify the same with reasonable certainty. The evidence offered by the defendants rebutted that of the plaintiff, and showed that on June 30, 1880, when Boaro entered upon the ground in controversy, he found nothing on the surface to indicate a vein or lode, or that any excavation had been made or stake erected, as alleged by the plaintiff, or that any portion of the ground claimed by the defendants had ever been previously located or claimed; that their discovery cut was commenced at a point thirty-five feet distant from the point described and claimed by Carroll as the point at which he had begun to sink the discovery shaft of the \\"Hawk Lode,\\" and erected his stake and posted his notice, and that the top of the vein was at least four feet below the surface; that Carroll had abandoned all claim to the premises in controversy, and that his omission to perform the required location work was due to such abandonment, and not to any threats of the defendants, or of any of them, nor to the occupation of the ground by Boaro and Hull, or either of them; that neither the plaintiff nor Carroll ever demanded possession of or asserted any title to the premises until the working of the claim by the defendants had shown it to be valuable. The evidence of the defendants also showed that they had commenced work upon the claim about July 21, 1880, and sank and excavated an open cut, striking the vein or lode at the depth of ten feet or more, and exposed therein a vein of rock in place bearing gold and silver; that no mineral nor any indications of a vein or lode were found until they reached the depth of seven or eight feet, and that subsequently, and within the time limited by law, they marked the bounds of their claim on said lode, called by them the \\"Johnny Bull Lode\\" and recorded a location certificate, describing their claim by reference to natural objects and permanent landmarks and complying in all respects with the requirements of the law. The court was requested to instruct the jury that from and after the date of the discovery upon vacant, unoccupied mineral lands, of the outcrop of a vein or body of mineral-bearing rock, the discoverer is entitled to the possession of the point at which he made his discovery and of such a reasonable amount of adjacent ground as is necessary or incidental to the proper prosecution of the work of opening up or exposing the vein or body of mineral-bearing rock to the depth and within the time required by law, and that to such extent he is protected by law in his possession for the period of sixty days from the date of his discovery. But the court refused to give this instruction, and the plaintiff excepted to the refusal. The court charged the jury, among other things, that it was in evidence, and seemed to be conceded, that the notice on the stake put up by Carroll contained no specification or description of the territory claimed by the locators, as that they claimed a number of feet on each side of the discovery or in any direction therefrom, and \\"in this respect,\\" said the court, \\"the notice was deficient, and under it the locators could not claim more than the very place in which it was planted. Elsewhere on the same lode or vein, if it extended beyond the point in controversy, any other citizen could make a valid location, for this notice, specifying no bounds or limits, could not be said to have any extent beyond what would be necessary for sinking a shaft,\\" and also that to entitle the plaintiff to recover, \\"it should appear from the evidence that Boaro entered at the very place which had been taken by Carroll, because, as Carroll's notice failed to specify the territory he wished to take, it could not refer to or embrace any other place than that in which it was planted.\\" The defendant obtained a verdict, the plaintiff brought the case to the high court on writ of error to review the judgment entered thereon. Justice Field delivered the opinion of the Court. The high court reversed the judgment of the court below, and the case remanded for a new trial.

This temple has a trustee which was formed in the late 1920s by a leading industrialist Mr.P.S.Saathappa Chettiar from Coimbatore. This trustee is maintained by his successors. Legend Thirunindravur, near Chennai once saw the outpour of devotion of a devout heart as well as the reciprocated grace as a result of the intense devotion. Poosalaar, was a poor man in terms of material wealth but rich in dedicated devotion towards Lord Shiva. His heart brimmed with love and devotion for the Lord. He was called Poosalaar as his body was always smeared with the sacred ash, (Tamil-Poosu-Apply). Bhagavan Ramana says that the right kind of desire on the spiritual path will condition an aspirant to become one with the divine ultimately. Poosalaar was not an exception to this and he yearned to erect a beautiful temple for his heart's favourite. However he became the object of people's ridicule for his herculean desire in his impoverished condition. Poosalaar however was not deterred by the words of the people. His heart was large enough to house Shiva's temple and his love served to implement the task with ease. Meanwhile, Rajasimha Pallava, the King of Kanchi had undertaken the task of erecting a temple for Lord Shiva. On the completion of the task, the king wanted it to be named Rajasimeswaram and duly consecrated. Hence the king fixed a date for the consecration. The day before the assigned date the king's heart was brimming with pride of having erected a beautiful temple for the Lord as his eyes shut with his thoughts vanishing into his sleep. The Lord appeared in his dream and stated that He will not be able make present Himself in the consecration ceremony as He will be present in the consecration ceremony of another temple built by an ardent devotee, Poosalaar. Hence the king was asked by the Lord to choose another date to have Him installed ceremoniously on another day in the temple built by him. The surprised king immediately commanded the culmination of the ceremonies associated with the temple consecration and proceeded to check out on the temple of Poosalaar. Coming to know that Poosalaar lived in a nearby town he set out towards Thirunindravur. The king was perplexed on the results of his enquiry that Poosalaar lived in poverty and there was not a sign of a new temple being erected in Thirunindravur. Counting on the Lord's words, the King sought to meet Poosalaar who was meditating under a tree. The king approached Poosalaar and stated the purpose of his visit. Poosalaar replied with joy to have a look at the ceremonious installation of Lord Shiva in the temple that he had built. Lo and Behold! The king witnessed the consecration ceremony of the temple built by Poosalaar within the heart of Poosalaar, with the chanting of the Vedas and other ceremonial activities! It was then that the king realized that the poor devotee had visualized his desire stage by stage within his heart, surrendering his will and wish to his beloved Lord. The pure devotion and the unconditional love for the Lord had led the almighty to be enshrined in his heart forever. The king then materialized the temple that Poosalaar had built in the cavern of his heart before having the temple built by him duly consecrated. He called the deity 'Irudhayaleeswarar', the one who abides in the heart. Poosalaar is one of the sixty three Nayanmars stated in the Periyapuranam. Temple Thirunindravur, the place where the temple of Hridayaleeswarar is situated is located in the Thiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu near Chennai. The inner roof of the temple is fashioned like that of a heart divided into four compartments probably displaying Poosalaar's conception. Parvati here is worshipped as Maragathambigai. Poosalaar's statue is found with folded hands in the shrine of Irudhayaleeeswarar. Irudhayaleeswarar is also worshipped as Manavaleswarar. People with an ailing heart is said to flock to this temple for speedy recovery due to Irudhayaleeswarar's grace. The story of this temple states that the Lord surrenders to the ambit of a devotee's pure devotion and not extravaganza. The story symbolically represents the Vedic principle of seeking the lord within one's heart and to ultimately lose oneself in Him indivisibly which is what is realization. Poosalaar sought the Lord within Himself which led to His liberation from the cycle of birth and death. In the words of Ramana Maharshi, the greatest form of bakti or devotion is to find and identify Him within oneself to destroy even the least distance between Him and the one seeking to.

Creation In late 1897 the citizens of Demorest petitioned the state of Georgia for the creation of an institution. On September 6, 1897, Habersham County approved the petition and issued a charter for the institution that would later be known as Piedmont College. The citizens of Demorest had purchased a girls' dormitory and had appointed a board of trustees and the college was officially formed. Although the charter had been obtained, and the institution was on its way to becoming what it is today, the Board of Trustees, who were mostly made up of Methodists across the state, needed a president who would be the driving force for starting the college. The man they chose was Charles C. Spence, a native Georgian who was a graduate of Emory College and former president of Young Harris College. Spence set up the college in similar fashion to Young Harris. It had three parts: preparatory, academic and collegiate. The preparatory and academic parts were what are now known as elementary, middle, and high schools. The institution was named the J.S. Green Collegiate Institute. Because it was essentially a Methodist school, it was named for local banker and Methodist Jesse S. Green. In 1899, the name was shortened to the J.S. Green College. Becoming Piedmont Piedmont College Gym Class circa 1901 John Charles Campbell In the early 1900s, there was a large draw to the Demorest area from many northern Congregationalists. This new influx of Congregationalists brought many highly educated people into the college circle. One of these new residents was John Charles Campbell, who would become the second president of Piedmont. Campbell came to Demorest to serve as principal of the preparatory portion of the J.S. Green College. When Spence resigned due to health issues, Campbell was promoted. Around the same time that Campbell became president, the board of trustees decided to sell the charter for the J.S. Green College to the Congregational churches, who elected all Congregationalists to the new board of trustees. With the changing of ownership came some controversy. It was believed at the time that the school was named after Jesse S. Green because of his religious affiliation with the Methodist church. The Congregationalists wanted the school to not be tied down to one religious association. So in 1903, the college was renamed Piedmont College after the area of Georgia in which it was located. Early 1900s Campbell resigned as president in 1907 after deciding he needed to rest more. The third president of the college became Henry Clinton Newell who originally came to Piedmont as a professor of science. Newell would also become the fifth president, coming out of retirement to help the college out. Most of Newell's presidency focused on acquiring financial stability for the college. During Newell's three years, he helped acquire the college's first endowment fund. Newell resigned for many of the same reasons as his predecessors. He resigned because of his declining health. In 1910, Frank Edwin Jenkins would become the fourth president of Piedmont College. Before becoming president, Jenkins served as the chair of the board of trustees. Where Newell focused heavily on finances, Jenkins focused his efforts on Piedmont's growth and status as an education institution. His first major expansion of the college was acquiring new buildings and upgrading old buildings for a total of 37 usable buildings for the college's use. All of the new expansions cost the college a large sum of money. Since there were no wealthy individual backers, most of the income came from numerous smaller donations. Another source of income, which Jenkins revamped to be more profitable was the College Farm, a piece of land. The farm was successful in helping out all aspects of Piedmont. Food from the farm was served at meals, saving the college money. The farm also provided jobs to many male students for a large discount of tuition. The parts of the crops that were left after Piedmont used its share were sold in markets to raise money for the college. In 1920 the academy, which was the primary schools, discontinued so more effort could be focused into turning Piedmont into a better college. 1930s, 40s and 50s Piedmont College Home Economics Lab circa 1909 Just months after the fall of the stock market on Black Tuesday, Jenkins resigned the presidency back to Newell. Because the economy was bad for most of the nation, Piedmont only barely survived the first few years of the depression. Newell brought the college through those tough years leaving it in 1936 in the hands of George C. Bellingrath, the sixth president of Piedmont. Because of the depression, funds were not available to acquire new buildings. No other major construction projects took place on the campus. The 1930s found years unprecedented heights in enrollment numbers. Also during this time, Piedmont increased its number of degree programs from three to five: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Philosophy, Bachelor of Science in Home Economics and a Bachelor of Music. In 1939, Belligrath's contract was not renewed and the board of trustees appointed Malcolm Boyd Dana as president. Dana was the first president of Piedmont College to have been born in the 20th century. Throughout his five years at Piedmont, Dana focused primarily on keeping his ideals of Piedmont being a Christian college a reality. Another major part of his presidency was devoted to updating the curriculum to more modern educational theories. The program he created to do this aimed \\"to equip each student with those facts and theories, social skills, and Christian attitudes, essential for constructive citizenship and joyous living.\\" Before his term ended, Dana made a point to equip the school with six buildings, including a gymnasium that would be shared with Demorest High School. He acquired the funding that Piedmont had not been able to acquire due to the depression of the 1930s. Many of these buildings were set up to be used for physical fitness, something that Dana thought was crucial for college students. With physical fitness came a renewed desire for athletics on the college campus. Dana resigned in 1944 and the current dean, Albert Ray Van Cleave took his place as president for the remainder of the 1940s. Van Cleave weathered through the rough years that were during World War II. Although the war did have a great effect on the enrollment of Piedmont, it was not the worst crisis Van Cleave had to deal with. The worst crisis was that Piedmont had not been accredited and needed to be or it would be forced to close. This meant the college had to meet the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools' requirements: $500,000 endowment, faculty with appropriate degrees and sufficient income to meet current expenses. Piedmont had no luck finding resources in the south, so Van Cleave had to look for funds in the north. Unfortunately Van Cleave was not able to secure the funds necessary in the time allotted. The Walter years The Board of Trustees in 1949 allowed Van Cleave to resume the office of the Dean while James E. Walter would become the 9th president. Walter's presidency was by far the longest in the history of the college as he was president for 34 years. The first major issue that Walter had to tackle was getting the endowment fund up to $500,000 which was $350,000 more than it was when he took office. In his first ten years, Walter was able to raise over $450,000 and bring the endowment fund to an acceptable level. By June 1953, Walter had won the appreciation for outstanding service and devotion to the college. On June 29 of the same year, TIME magazine said, \\"Of all U.S. college presidents, James E. Walter of Congregational Piedmont college in Demorest, Georgia is probably the most tenacious.\\"\\" /ref> Piedmont received accreditation was achieved in 1965. Walter had increased the endowment fund into the double-digit million-dollar mark by 1982. Walter had decided that his time as president needed to come to an end and in 1983 he retired. The end of the century Because of Walter's long term as president, the board of trustees was well-prepared for his successor. David Garen Simmons took over from Walter in 1983. The last twenty years of the 20th century at Piedmont are marked as the \\"years of change.\\" The curriculum expanded to include new majors and minors, computers made appearances throughout the faculty and staff offices, and a program for non- traditional students was created. Simmons retired to just teaching history in 1990 after Walter died in 1989 and John F. Elger took his place as president for the next five years. Most of Elger's presidency is marked by the change in buildings and facilities across campus. New buildings were purchased; old buildings got remodeled and had extensions added. Plans were started to get a new pipe organ installed in the college chapel. Another major change under Elger was the creation of the Master of Art in Teaching program. John Elger retired from education and administration in 1995. W. Ray Cleere became president in 1995, taking the reins from Elger. President Cleere has seen the college through many building expansions and curriculum expansions. Approximately six majors were added to the various programs at Piedmont during Cleere's presidency. One of the major feats of Cleere's time at Piedmont was expanding the college into a second campus. Piedmont College leased property in Athens, Georgia to start their new campus. Later the college purchased property from Prince Avenue Baptist Church. In 2007 the Athens campus started its first students for the four-year degree. A dark spot on Cleere's record were the false accusations against Richard Jewell for the Olympic Park bombing at Atlanta, in 1996. It was Cleere who first alerted the FBI that they should look at Jewell, a former security guard at Piedmont, after Cleere watched Jewell's CNN Interview. Jewell was later exonerated, and a lawsuit against Cleere and Piedmont College was settled out of court.ESPN: \\"Judging Jewell\\" First aired February 2014 The college Board of Trustees, which in March 2013 had named Dr. James Mellichamp interim president, voted May 4 to make the position permanent. Mellichamp becomes the 13th president of Piedmont to serve during the 115-year history of the college, which has campuses in Demorest and Athens. He joined Piedmont in 1982 as a professor of music, a position he has held since that time. But he has also worn a number of hats at the college, including most recently serving as Provost, Vice President for Academic Affairs, and Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences.

Wildlife in Belize is defined as any undomesticated mammal, reptile or bird, amphibian and any egg, nest or part or product thereof. Although Belize is only long and a little more than wide, it hosts a remarkable abundance of flora and fauna. It is the home of more than 150 species of mammals, 549 birds, 150 amphibians and reptiles, nearly 600 species of freshwater and marine fish and 3,408 species of vascular plants. The Forest Department under the Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries and Sustainable Development is the regulatory body that enforces the Wildlife Protection Act. The Wildlife Protection Act's main goal is to rescue the over one hundred globally threatened species in Belize from local extinction. The National List of Critical Native Species includes 11 Critically Endangered Species, 31 Endangered Species and 63 Vulnerable Species. In Belize, threats to wildlife from the illegal wildlife trade have been, in general, historically marginal; Belize has low population pressure and large wilderness areas. Parrots are the major species threatened by the wildlife trade. People of all classes keep pet parrots; however, in 2016 the Government of Belize closed the amnesty period for registering parrots already in captivity and began prohibiting the ownership of newly-captured baby parrots under the National Captive Wildlife permit program. Although the government of Belize has imposed conservation measures, the increasing human population of Belize and forest clearance and fragmentation have pressured wildlife; the percentage of forest cover in Belize has declined from 74.4% in 1980 to 60.3% in 2014. In the last five years, the Forest Department has adopted a Wildlife Conservation Program (abbreviated to WCP), which provides active management and protection of wildlife. The legal authority for the Wildlife Conservation Program comes from the Wildlife Protection Act. The Program is responsible for implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity, to which Belize is a party, and meeting Belize's obligation to maintain its threatened species, including those targeted by the wildlife trade. It is also a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which limits trade in threatened wildlife through the CITES permission system. The Wildlife Program enforces these treaties through measures that protect wildlife from hunting, poaching and other extraction activities. To accomplish its conservation-related goals, the Belize Forest Department has a Memorandum of Understandings with rehabilitation and conservation organisations in Belize including Belize Bird Rescue, Wildtracks Rehabilitation Program (Primate and Manatee), The Belize Zoo, The Green Iguana Project, Belize Raptor Center, Friends for Conservation and Development (FCD), The Belize Wildlife and Referral Clinic, American Crocodile Education Sanctuary, and Sea to Shore Alliance. The Forest Department has also implemented closed and open seasons for popular hunted games species such as deer (male and female), armadillo, gibnut, peccaries, iguanas and game birds.

She is famous as the first Royal Navy ship to be commanded by Horatio Nelson. Career Badger was one of a number of ships purchased for service on the North America and West Indies Station during the American Revolutionary War. She was previously an American merchant vessel, Defence, and had been purchased in Jamaica in November 1777 for the sum of ¬£1,540. She replaced an earlier that had been bought the previous year but condemned as unfit for service in 1777. Little is known about her specifications, but she probably carried 12 guns, and was apparently 'capable of carrying 16 guns'. Her first commander was Commander Michael John Everett, who brought with him the crew of the earlier Badger. On 8 December 1778 the commander of the North America and West Indies Station, Sir Peter Parker, transferred a young lieutenant named Horatio Nelson, who had previously been serving aboard his flagship , to the command of Badger, and moved Everett to command the newly captured and commissioned 18-gun sloop . Badger was Nelson's first experience of command of one of the Royal Navy's commissioned warships, and he duly took command in January 1779.Nelson (1844), p.6. Nelson spent half of 1779 cruising the Caribbean, ranging off the Spanish colonies in Central America in search of prizes. Nelson did not have much success, but on 11 June 1779 Parker promoted Nelson to post captain and gave him the command of the 28-gun frigate . On 20 June Nelson duly handed Badger over to Commander Cuthbert Collingwood. Collingwood commanded Badger until early 1780, and in March that year he was succeeded by Commander Samuel Walker. Walker was replaced in September that year by Commander Richard Storey, who was commander in an acting capacity. It had been planned that Commander Donald Sutherland would take over command, but he had died on 9 September, after only two days in command. In December 1780 Commander James Cornwallis took over. Badger was temporarily under Lieutenant William Sykes between January 1781 and possibly March 1782. Badger was paid off at Jamaica in May 1782, and was sold there in June the following year for ¬£2,050.

He was the second officer to hold the title of colonel in the 10th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment.Boatner, Mark M. III. The Civil War Dictionary. New York: David McKay, 1959. p. 636. . Biography Kirk was born in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, a son of George A. and Jane (Thompson) Kirk. He was educated in the common schools and then became a merchant tailor. In 1851, he moved to Washington, Pennsylvania, where he owned and operated a retail store.Bates, Samuel P., Martial Deeds of Pennsylvania. Harrisburg: B. Singerly, State Printers. p. 848. Kirk enlisted in the Army shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War and was commissioned in June 1861 as the captain of Company D of the 10th Pennsylvania Reserves (also known as the 39th Pennsylvania Infantry). Three weeks later, he became the regiment's lieutenant colonel. He saw his first combat in the Battle of Dranesville in Northern Virginia, on December 20, 1861. When Colonel John S. McCalmont resigned in May 1862, Kirk was promoted to colonel. He commanded the regiment during the battles of Beaver Dam Creek, Gaines Mill, Glendale and Second Bull Run. In the first three actions, the regiment belonged to the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Division of Maj. Gen. Fitz-John Porter's V Corps. At Second Bull Run, it fought with the 3rd Brigade of John F. Reynolds's independent division. He briefly led the brigade before being wounded and out of action. As a result of his injuries, he missed the battles of South Mountain and Antietam. When it became evident that his wounds would prevent any further field duty, he resigned from the army on October 18, 1862. Following the war, Kirk resumed his mercantile business. He died at the age of 60 in Washington, Pennsylvania, and is buried in Washington Cemetery. Notes References *Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, Volume 2. New York: Castle Books, 1956.

Fluoridated water has fluoride at a level that is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride. Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth it creates low levels of fluoride in saliva, which reduces the rate at which tooth enamel demineralizes and increases the rate at which it remineralizes in the early stages of cavities. Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about $ per person-year. Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. In 2011 the World Health Organization suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/L (milligrams per litre), depending on climate, local environment, and other sources of fluoride.Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, 4th Edition WHO, 2011. . Page 168, 175, 372 and see also pp 370-73. See also J. Fawell, et al Fluoride in Drinking-water. WHO, 2006. Page 32. Quote: \\"Concentrations in drinking-water of about 1 mg l‚Äì1 are associated with a lower incidence of dental caries, particularly in children, whereas excess intake of fluoride can result in dental fluorosis. In severe cases this can result in erosion of enamel. The margin between the beneficial effects of fluoride and the occurrence of dental fluorosis is small and public health programmes seek to retain a suitable balance between the two\\" Bottled water typically has unknown fluoride levels. Dental caries remains a major public health concern in most industrialized countries, affecting 60‚Äì90% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults. Water fluoridation reduces cavities in children, while efficacy in adults is less clear. A Cochrane review estimates a reduction in cavities when water fluoridation was used by children who had no access to other sources of fluoride to be 35% in baby teeth and 26% in permanent teeth. Most European countries have experienced substantial declines in tooth decay without its use. Recent studies suggest that water fluoridation, particularly in industrialized countries, may be unnecessary because topical fluorides (such as in toothpaste) are widely used and caries rates have become low. For this reason, some scientists consider fluoridation to be unethical due to \\"the debilitating effects of fluoride toxicity\\" and the lack of informed consent. Although fluoridation can cause dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of developing teeth or enamel fluorosis, the differences are mild and usually not considered to be of aesthetic or public-health concern. Summary: There is no clear evidence of other adverse effects from water fluoridation, as revealed by the York review from 2000. Report website: Authors' summary: Authors' commentary: A 2007 Australian systematic review used the same inclusion criteria as York's, plus one additional study. This did not affect the York conclusions. Fluoride's effects depend on the total daily intake of fluoride from all sources. Drinking water is typically the largest source; other methods of fluoride therapy include fluoridation of toothpaste, salt, and milk. The views on the most effective method for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed. The Australian government states that water fluoridation is the most effective means of achieving fluoride exposure that is community-wide. The World Health Organization states water fluoridation, when feasible and culturally acceptable, has substantial advantages, especially for subgroups at high risk, while the European Commission finds no advantage to water fluoridation compared with topical use. Currently about 372 million people (around 5.7% of the world population) receive artificially-fluoridated water in about 24 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Republic of Ireland, Malaysia, the U.S., and Vietnam. With 57.4 million people who receive naturally occurring fluoridated water at or above optimal levels in countries such as Sweden, China, Sri Lanka, Finland, Zimbabwe and Gabon. Community water fluoridation is rare in Continental Europe with 97‚Äì98% choosing not to fluoridate drinking water. Fluoridated salt and milk is promoted in some European countries instead. Water fluoridation has been replaced by other modes in many countries where water supplies are too decentralized for it to be a practical choice, or existing natural fluoride levels were already ample, including Germany, Finland, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark and at a time Israel. Cessation of water fluoridation has been demonstrated in scientific studies such as a recent one in Calgary, Alberta, to result in increased rates of dental decay. While fluoridation can result in mild dental fluorosis, this effect is barely detectable and causes no concerns with the appearance or health of teeth. Countries practicing artificial water fluoridation vary in their recommended fluoride levels according to what health authorities in each have determined to be most effective for its citizens. The US recently reset the recommended optimal level of fluoride in drinking water, lowering it slightly, because of observed increased Fluorosis levels, likely due to additional fluoride sources like toothpaste and mouthwash which were not present when this level was originally set. Africa Of Africa's 1.1 billion people, about 400,000 get artificially-fluoridated water (in Libya, data pre-2003). Egypt Water is fluoridated in Egypt, with no recommended minimum value but with a maximum value of 0.4 mg/L.  Libya  Before 2003, 400,000 Libyans were receiving artificially-fluoridated water.  Nigeria  Only a fraction of Nigerians receive water from waterworks, so water fluoridation affects very few people. A 2009 study found that about 21% of water sources naturally contain fluoride to the recommended range of 0.3‚Äì0.6 ppm. About 62% have fluoride below this range. South Africa South Africa's Health Department recommends adding fluoridation chemicals to drinking water in some areas. It also advises removal of fluoride from drinking water (defluoridation) where the fluoride content is too high.ml \\"Water Fluoridation - The Facts\\", from South Africa's Department of Health website. Retrieved 29 April 2006. Legislation around mandatory fluoridation was introduced in 2002, but has been delayed since then pending further research after opposition from water companies, municipalities and the public.http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click;_id=125&art;_id=vn20030108054021972C918779  Zambia  Approximately 947,000 (7% of the population) receives water with naturally occurring fluoride in it.  Zimbabwe  Roughly 2,600,000 (21% of the population) receives water with naturally occurring fluoride in it. Asia China Many areas in China have fluoride at levels far higher than recommended due to natural occurrence or industrial contamination, which has resulted in high incidences of skeletal fluorosis.https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/1825033/chinas- unsafe-drinking-water-afflicts-millions-disease-state Water fluoridation levels are set at a national standard of 1 mg/L, with higher levels for rural areas at 1.2 mg/L.http://www.chinacdc.cn/jdydc/200701/P0200701183221449199226657492006497.pdf Water fluoridation began in 1965 in the urban area of Guangzhou. It was interrupted during 1976‚Äì1978 due to the shortage of sodium silico-fluoride. It was resumed only in the Fangcun district of the city, but was halted in 1983 after opponents claimed that fluoride levels were already sufficiently high in local foods and tea. Later analysis in 1988 found that the incidence of dental caries among 4-year-old children had increased by 62%. The fluoridation reduced the number of cavities, but increased dental fluorosis; the fluoride levels could have been set too high, and low-quality equipment led to inconsistent, and often excessive, fluoride concentrations. Hong Kong All Hong Kong residents receive natural occurring fluoride in water, at about half the traditionally-recommended fluoride level. The Water Supplies Department fluoridates rainwater from 17 local reservoirs, in 21 treatment plants. Recent tests showed drinking water to have an average fluoride level of 0.48 mg/L, and a maximum of 0.69 mg/L. India Water fluoridation is not practiced in India.Ingram, Colin. (2006). The Drinking Water Book. pp. 15-16Control of Fluorosis in India Due to naturally-occurring fluoride, both skeletal and dental fluorosis have been endemic in India in at least 20 states, including Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The maximum permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water in India is 1.2 mg/L,WHO  Naturally occurring hazards and the government has been obligated to install fluoride removal plants of various technologies to reduce fluoride levels from industrial waste and mineral deposits. Now reverse osmosis plants are widely used. Household and public system reverse osmosis plants are common in the market. Alleppey in Kerala is most affected with over-fluoridated water. Government-installed reverse osmosis plants supply free filtered water. Rotary International Club, Saratoga USA, helped to install 3 RO Plants in rural Alleppey. , there are 14,132 habitations in 19 States still containing fluoride above the permissible levels in drinking water. Rajasthan has the highest number of habitations (7,670) with high amount of fluoride in drinking water. Telangana has 1174, Karnataka has 1122 and Madhya Pradesh has 1055 habitation. Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Odisha, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh also has such habitations. The government of India launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Fluorosis in 2008‚Äì2009. In 2013‚Äì2014, the programme was brought under the National Rural Health Mission, which has so far covered 111 districts. The programme includes surveillance of fluorosis in the community, training and manpower support, establishment of diagnostic facilities, treatment and health education. The Indian Council of Medical Research has formed a task force on fluorosis to address issues related to prevention and control. Israel Fluoride was required in water supplies nationwide by legislation passed in 2002, but the requirement was repealed in 2014, and artificial fluoridation was disparaged by national health officials, effectively ending the practice in Israel for a short while.Press Releases (17 August 2014) End of Mandatory Fluoridation in Israel, Ministry of Health (Israel). Retrieved 29 September 2014. After the election of 2015 the fluoridation program is to be re-debated the new deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman. Mekorot, Israel's national water company states, \\"In the South of the country, it is unnecessary to add fluoride because it is found naturally in the water.\\" Water fluoridation was introduced in Israel's large cities in 1981, and a national effort to fluoridate all the country's water was approved in 1988. In 2002, the Union of Local Authorities (ULA) and others petitioned Israel's High Court to stop the Health Ministry from forcing cities to implement water fluoridation. The court soon issued a restraining order, but after half a year ULA withdrew its petition upon the request of the court. By 2011, about 65% of the municipalities and local authorities in Israel had agreed to allow fluoridation, and there was active opposition to the spread of fluoridation to the towns where it has not yet been instituted. In 2011, the Health and Welfare Committee of the Knesset criticized the Health Ministry for continuation of water fluoridation. On 26 August 2014, Israel officially stopped adding fluoride to its water supplies. According to a Ministry of Health press release statement, the reasons it ended water fluoridation were: \\"Only some 1% of the water is used for drinking, while 99% of the water is intended for other uses (industry, agriculture, flushing toilets etc.). There is also scientific evidence that fluoride in large amounts can lead to damage to health. When fluoride is supplied via drinking water, there is no control regarding the amount of fluoride actually consumed, which could lead to excessive consumption. Supply of fluoridated water forces those who do not so wish to also consume water with added fluoride.\\" Many in the medical and dental communities in Israel criticized the decision as a mistake. After the election of 2015, the new deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman announced that the fluoridation program will be re-debated. Japan The first community water fluoridation programme was in Kyoto prefecture in 1952, lasting 13 years. The second was established by US military authorities in Okinawa prefecture in 1957, lasting 15 years. The last experience was in Mie Prefecture in 1967, lasting 4 years. Less than 1% of Japan practices water fluoridation.NCFPR. Fluoridation Facts: Antifluoride Assertion - \\"Advanced Countries Shun Fluoridation\\" . Drawn from the ADA Fluoridation Facts document.

South Korea In 2005, the ruling Uri Party proposed legislation for compulsory water fluoridation for municipalities. The legislation failed, and only 29 out of around 250 municipal governments had introduced water fluoridation at that time. Fluoridation was proposed again in 2012. Malaysia In 1998, 66% of Malaysians were getting fluoridated water. In 2010, Bernama reported, \\"Principal Director (Oral Health) in the Health Ministry, Datuk Dr Norain Abu Taib said that only 75.5% of the country's population are enjoying the benefits of water fluoridation\\". Singapore In 1956, Singapore was the first Asian country to institute a water fluoridation program that covered 100% of the population. Water is fluoridated to a typical value of 0.4-0.6 mg per litre.Water Treatment, Public Utility Board. Vietnam Only about 4% of the population of Vietnam has water fluoridation, whereas only 70% get their water from public supplies. Europe Out of a population of about three-quarters of a billion, under 14 million people (approximately 2%) in Europe receive artificially-fluoridated water. Those people are in the UK (5,797,000), Republic of Ireland (4,780,000), Spain (4,250,000), and Serbia (300,000). The first water fluoridation in Europe was in West Germany and Sweden in 1952, bringing fluoridated water to about 42,000 people. By mid-1962, about 1 million Europeans in 18 communities in 11 countries were receiving fluoridated water. Many European countries have rejected water fluoridation, including: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Scotland, Iceland, and Italy. A 2003 survey of over 500 Europeans from 16 countries concluded that \\"the vast majority of people opposed water fluoridation\\". Austria Austria has never implemented fluoridation. Belgium Belgium does not fluoridate its water supply, although legislation permits it. Czech Republic Czech Republic (previously Czechoslovakia) started water fluoridation in 1958 in T√°bor. In Prague fluoridation started in 1975. It was stopped in Prague in 1988 and subsequently in the whole country. Since 2008 no water has been fluoridated.

Estonia There is no water fluoridation in Estonia. About 4% of the population may be exposed to excessive natural fluoride in drinking waters, and there are measures to remove excess fluoride. Finland Kuopio is the only community in Finland with at least 70,000 people that has ever had water fluoridated. Kuopio stopped fluoridation in 1992. In regions with rapakivi bedrock (small, but densely populated regions), 22% of well waters and 55% of drilled well waters exceed the legal limit of 1.5 mg/l; generally, surface and well waters have 0.5-2.0 mg/l fluoride in affected regions. France Fluoridated salt is available in France, and 3% of the population uses naturally fluoridated water, but the water is not artificially fluoridated.

Kassel- Wahlershausen in West Germany became the second location in Europe where water fluoridation was practiced in 1952. By 1962, no other part of the FRG was fluoridating, This paper includes some history of water fluoridation in Europe, 1952-1962. and Kassel-Wahlershausen discontinued the practice in 1971. In the GDR (East Germany) in the late 1980s, about 3.4 million people (20%) were receiving water with added fluoride. Fluoride tablets were also provided. This work contains a world survey of water fluoridation ca. 1988. The fluoridated areas of the GDR included the towns of Karl-Marx-Stadt (now Chemnitz), Plauen, Zittau, and Spremberg. Children in those towns were part of large long-running studies of caries prevalence. A fluoride cessation study found that consistent with a previously observed population-wide phenomenon that the rate of cavities continued to drop after the fluoride concentration in water fell from the augmented 1.0 ppm to its natural level below 0.2 ppm. Water fluoridation was discontinued after the German reunification although still exists on some US military bases. Greece There is no water fluoridation in Greece. Hungary In the early 1960s the city of Szolnok briefly fluoridated its water. The program was discontinued due to technical problems and a public view that fluoridation did not seem reasonable. Hungary has not used artificially fluoridated water since then. Ireland The Republic of Ireland is the only European country with a policy of mandatory water fluoridation. Worldwide, the Irish Republic and Singapore are the only countries which implement mandatory water fluoridation. The majority of drinking water in the Republic, (but not Northern Ireland), is fluoridated. In 2012, roughly 3.25 million people received artificially-fluoridated water. Almost 71% of the population in 2002 resided in fluoridated communities.Report of the Forum on Fluoridation 2002, p.76 - Dept of Health and Children - Ireland The fluoridation agent used is hydrofluorosilicic acid (HFSA; H2SiF6).Report of the Forum on Fluoridation 2002, pp.29‚Äì30 In a 2002 public survey, 45% of respondents expressed some concern about fluoridation.Report of the Forum on Fluoridation 2002, p.37 In 1957, the Department of Health established a Fluorine Consultative Council which recommended fluoridation at 1.0 ppm of public water supplies, then accessed by approximately 50% of the population. This was felt to be an effective way of preventing tooth decay, in an era before fluoridated toothpaste was commonly used.Report of the Forum on Fluoridation 2002, p.72 This led to the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960, which mandated compulsory fluoridation by local authorities.Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, Irish Statute Book The statutory instruments made in 1962‚Äì65 under the 1960 Act were separate for each local authority, setting the level of fluoride in drinking water to 0.8‚Äì1.0 ppm.Report of the Forum on Fluoridation 2002, p.170A full list is in The current regulations date from 2007, and set the level to 0.6‚Äì0.8 ppm, with a target value of 0.7 ppm. Implementation of fluoridation was held up by preliminary dental surveying and water testing,Report of the Forum on Fluoridation 2002, p.73 and a court case, Ryan v. Attorney General. In 1960, the Fianna F√°il minister for health, Se√°n MacEntee, brought forward the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act and a Dublin housewife Gladys Ryan challenged the Act as an ‚Äúinvasion of family rights‚Äù. Ryan lost the case, which lasted 65 days, at the High Court (Ireland), and appealed to the Supreme Court. Ryan was represented in court by Se√°n MacBride who argued that fluoridation was an infringement of human rights since people had no option but to drink it. Ryan's lawyers, including Richie Ryan (politician) worked on a pro bono basis and expenses were paid by fundraising. In 1965, the Supreme Court rejected Gladys Ryan's appeal that the Act violated the Constitution of Ireland's guarantee of the right to bodily integrity.Report of the Forum on Fluoridation 2002, pp.74‚Äì76 By 1965, Greater Dublin's water was fluoridated; by 1973, other urban centers were too.Report of the Forum on Fluoridation 2002, p.76 Studies from the late 1970s to mid 1990s showed a decrease in (and lower incidence of) dental decay in school children living in areas where water was fluoridated than in areas where water was not fluoridated.Report of the Forum on Fluoridation 2002, pp.76‚Äì78 The government of the Republic of Ireland has yet to carry out a public health survey on the effects of fluoridation, even though this is required to under the 1960 Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act. A private member's bill to end fluoridation was defeated in the D√°il on 12 November 2013. It was supported by Sinn F√©in and some of the technical group and opposed by the Fine Gael-Labour government and Fianna F√°il. There is much local government opposition to compulsory fluoridation, legally mandated nationwide by D√°il √âireann. Early in 2014, Cork County Council and Laois County Council passed motions for the cessation of water fluoridation. In Autumn 2014, Cork City Council, Dublin City Council and Kerry County Council passed similar motions. Fine Gael was opposed to compulsory water fluoridation but they now support the policy. Fianna F√°il is in favour of compulsory water fluoridation and in 2004 Micheal Martin set up the pro-fluoride Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health.

Netherlands Water was fluoridated in large parts of the Netherlands from 1960 to 1973, when the High Council of The Netherlands declared fluoridation of drinking water unauthorized. Dutch authorities had no legal basis for adding chemicals to drinking water if they would not contribute to a sound water supply. Drinking water has not been fluoridated in any part of the Netherlands since 1973. Norway In 2000, representatives of the Norwegian National Institute for Public Health reported that no cities in Norway were practicing water fluoridation. There had been intense discussion of the issue around 1980, but no ongoing political discussion in 2000. Serbia About 300,000 people in Serbia (3%) were receiving fluoridated water before 2003. Spain Around 10% of the population (4,250,000 people) receive fluoridated water. Sweden In 1952, Norrk√∂ping in Sweden became one of the first cities in Europe to fluoridate its water supply. It was declared illegal by the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden in 1961, re-legalized in 1962 and finally prohibited by the parliament in 1971, after considerable debate. The parliament majority said that there were other and better ways of reducing tooth decay than water fluoridation. Four cities received permission to fluoridate tap water when it was legal. An official commission was formed, which published its final report in 1981. They recommended other ways of reducing tooth decay (improving food and oral hygiene habits) instead of fluoridating tap water. They also found that many people found fluoridation to infringe upon personal liberty/freedom of choice by forcing them to be medicated, and that the long-term effects of fluoridation were insufficiently acknowledged. They also lacked a proper study on the effects of fluoridation on formula-fed infants. In the year 2004 the allowed amount of fluoride in the water was decreased to 1,5 mg/l. Switzerland In Switzerland, since 1962, two fluoridation programs had operated in tandem: water fluoridation in the City of Basel, and salt fluoridation in the rest of Switzerland (around 83% of domestic salt sold had fluoride added). However it became increasingly difficult to keep the two programs separate. As a result, some of the population of Basel were assumed to use both fluoridated salt and fluoridated water. In order to correct the situation, in April 2003 the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt resolved to cease water fluoridation and expand salt fluoridation to Basel.J. MEYER and P. Wiehl in Schweiz Monatsschr. Zahnmed 2003; 113: 702 (in French) and 728-729 (in German) United Kingdom Around 14% of the population of the United Kingdom receives fluoridated water. About half a million people receive water that is naturally fluoridated with calcium fluoride, and about 6 million total receive fluoridated water. The Water Act 2003 required water suppliers to comply with requests from local health authorities to fluoridate their water. The following UK water utility companies fluoridate their supply: *Anglian Water Services Ltd *Northumbrian Water Ltd *South Staffordshire Water plc *Severn Trent plc *United Utilities Water plc Earlier plans were undertaken in the Health Authority areas of Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Birmingham, Black Country, Cheshire, Merseyside, County Durham, Tees Valley, Cumbria, Lancashire, North, East Yorkshire, Northern Lincolnshire, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Trent and West Midlands South whereby fluoridation was introduced progressively in the years between 1964 and 1988. The South Central Strategic Health Authority carried out the first public consultation under the Water Act 2003, and in 2009 its board voted to fluoridate water supplies in the Southampton area to address the high incidence of tooth decay in children there. Surveys had found that the majority of surveyed Southampton residents opposed the plan, but the Southampton City Primary Care Trust decided that \\"public vote could not be the deciding factor and that medical evidence shows fluoridation will reduce tooth decay ‚Äì and failed to back up claims of serious negative side effects\\".\\"Southampton Fluoridation Challenge Launched\\" Seb Evans in Dentistry.co.uk, 30 June 2009. Fluoridation plans have been particularly controversial in the northwest of England and have been delayed after a large increase on projected costs was revealed. In October 2014, Public Health England abandoned plans for water fluoridation for 195,000 people in Southampton and neighbouring parts of south-west Hampshire due to opposition from both Hampshire County Council and Southampton City Council. It was reported in 2007 that the UK Milk Fluoridation Programme, centered in the northwest of England, involved more than 16,000 children. The water supply in Northern Ireland has never been artificially fluoridated except in two small localities where fluoride was added to the water for about 30 years. By 1999, fluoridation ceased in those two areas, as well. In 2004, following a public consultation, Scotland's parliament rejected proposals to fluoridate public drinking water. There are currently no community fluoridation schemes in Wales. The Welsh Government stated in November 2014 that it had no plans to fluoridate the water supply, but said that it was something the Welsh Government will continue to review. North America U.S. residents served with community water fluoridation, 1992 and 2006. The percentages are the proportions of the resident population served by public water supplies who are receiving fluoridated water. Canada The decision to fluoridate lies with local governments, with guidelines set by provincial, territorial, and federal governments. Brantford, Ontario, became the first city in Canada to fluoridate its water supplies in 1945. In 1955, Toronto approved water fluoridation, but delayed implementation of the program until 1963 due to a campaign against fluoridation by broadcaster Gordon Sinclair.\\"Gordon Sinclair's rant\\", from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Archives website.

In 2008 the recommended fluoride levels in Canada were reduced from 0.8‚Äì1.0 mg/L to 0.7 mg/L to minimize the risk of dental fluorosis. Ontario, Alberta, and Manitoba have the highest rates of fluoridation, about 70‚Äì75%. The lowest rates are in Quebec (about 6%), British Columbia (about 4% - Vancouver does not add Fluoride), and Newfoundland and Labrador (1.5%), with Nunavut and the Yukon having no fluoridation at all. Overall, about 45% of the Canadian population had access to fluoridated water supplies in 2007. A 2008 telephone survey found that about half of Canadian adults knew about fluoridation, and of these, 62% supported the idea. In 2010, the Region of Waterloo held a non- binding referendum for residents to decide whether water fluoridation should continue. The result of the vote was 50.3% voting against fluoridation. The regional council honored the vote, and over forty years of fluoridation in the city of Waterloo ended in November. In 2011, Calgary city council voted 10‚Äì3 to stop adding fluoride to the city's drinking water, having started water fluoridation in 1991. A research project has been planned to study the effects of Calgary's cessation, using Edmonton as a control. Lakeshore and Amherstberg have voted to end water fluoridation. Hamilton, London, and Toronto have recently chosen to continue fluoridation. Toronto treats its water to 0.6 mg/L. On 28 January 2013, Windsor city council voted 8‚Äì3 to cease fluoridation of Windsor's drinking water for five years, honoring a February 2012 recommendation by the Windsor Utilities Commission. Tecumseh gets its water from Windsor, and Tecmuseh's council had voted on 13 March 2012 to ask Windsor to stop fluoridating. Money formerly spent on fluoridation was reallocated to oral health and nutrition education programs. Windsor's water had been fluoridated for over fifty years. On 14 December 2018, Windsor city council voted 8‚Äì3 to reintroduce fluoridation of Windsor's drinking water. According to the Oral Health 2018 report released by the health unit, the percentage of children with tooth decay or requiring urgent care has increased by 51 per cent in 2016-17 compared to 2011‚Äì12. Mexico Mexico has no water fluoridation program; instead it has a table salt fluoridation program. United States As of May 2000, 42 of the 50 largest U.S. cities had water fluoridation. In 2010, 66% of all U.S. residents and 74% of U.S. residents with access to community water systems receive fluoridated water. In 2010, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study determined that \\"40.7% of adolescents aged 12‚Äì15 had dental fluorosis [in 1999‚Äì2004]\\". In response, in 2011 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to reduce the recommended level of fluoride in drinking water to the lowest end of the current range, 0.7 milligrams per liter of water (mg/L), from the previous recommended maximum of 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L in recognition of the increase in sources of fluoride such as fluoridated toothpastes and mouthwashes. This could effectively terminate municipal water fluoridation in areas where fluoride levels from mineral deposits and industrial pollution exceed the new recommendation.fluoridealert.org/re/thiessen-2-14-11.hhs.pdf As of 2020 the federal maximum contaminant level for fluoride in public water systems remains at 4.0 mg/L, which had been promulgated by EPA in 1986. Several states have set more stringent standards. Oceania Australia Australian residents served with community water fluoridation, 2005P Forster, Queensland Health Systems Review.

The percentages are the proportions of the resident population served by public water supplies who are receiving fluoridated water. Australia now provides fluoridated water for 70% or more of the population in all states and territories. Many of Australia's drinking water supplies began fluoridation in the 1960s and 1970s. By 1984 almost 66% of the Australian population had access to fluoridated drinking water, represented by 850 towns and cities.Inquiry into Water Fluoridation in the ACT - Report by the Standing Committee on Social Policy, 1991 Commonwealth Department of Health, Fluoridation of Water: A Collection. 9; Commonwealth Department of Health, Fluoridation of Water in Australia 1984 (Canberra: Australian Government Publishing Service, 1985), 13. Some areas within Australia have natural fluoride levels in the groundwater, which was estimated in 1991 to provide drinking water to approximately 0.9% of the population. The first town to fluoridate the water supply in Australia was Beaconsfield, Tasmania in 1953. Queensland became the last state to formally require the addition of fluoride to public drinking water supplies in December 2008. New Zealand The use of water fluoridation first began in Hastings, New Zealand in 1954. A Commission of Inquiry was held in 1957 and then its use rapidly expanded in the mid 1960s. New Zealand now has fluoridated water supplied to about half of the total population. Of the six main centers, only Christchurch and Tauranga do not have a fluoridated water supply. Wellington's water supply is mostly fluoridated, but the suburbs of Petone and Korokoro receive a non-fluoridated supply. In Auckland, the suburbs Onehunga and Huia Village don't fluoridate water. In 2013, a Hamilton City Council committee voted to remove fluoride from late June 2013. A referendum was held during the council elections in October 2013 with approximately 70% of voters voting for fluoride to be added back into the water supply, and in March 2014, the council voted 9 to 1 to re-introduce fluoride into the supply. In a 2007 referendum about half of voters in the Central Otago, South Otago and the Southland Region did not want fluoridation and voters in the Waitaki District were against water fluoridation for all Wards. Ashburton and Greymouth also voted against fluoridation. In 2014, the Prime Minister's Chief Science Advisor and the Royal Society of New Zealand published a report on the health effects of water fluoridation. In June 2018, the Supreme Court of New Zealand in New Health New Zealand Inc v South Taranaki District Council upheld the legality of water fluoridation in New Zealand. South America Brazil By 2008, 41% of people (73.2 million) in Brazil were getting artificially- fluoridated water. Water fluoridation was first adopted in Brazil in the city of Baixo Guandu, ES, in 1953. A 1974 federal law required new or enlarged water treatment plants to have fluoridation, and its availability was greatly expanded in the 1980s, with optimum fluoridation levels set at 0.8 mg/L. Today, the expansion of fluoridation in Brazil is a governmental priority; Between 2005 and 2008, fluoridation became available to 7.6 million people in 503 municipalities. As of 2008, 3,351 municipalities (60.6%) had adopted fluoridation, up from 2,466 in 2000.

He served as an advisor to President Dwight Eisenhower. Early life and education Gray was born September 2, 1921 in Hastings, Nebraska and graduated in 1943 from Carlton College in Northfield, Minnesota; he later graduated from Harvard University with a Masters in Business Administration. In between these, Gray served in the Navy during World War II and remained in the U.S. Naval Reserve, attaining the rank of commander. Career In government service In 1955, Gray was appointed Special Assistant for Manpower for the United States Department of the Navy, the following year, Gray served as Appointments Secretary to President Dwight Eisenhower and later as Secretary of his cabinet. Private sector He taught business administration at Nebraska's Hastings College. In the 1960s and 1970s, he served as Washington operative for Hill & Knowlton. In those years, according to a case study by the Harvard Business School, H&K;'s clients produced nearly 10% of the GNP. Gray provided services to accounts that included the American Petroleum Institute, Procter and Gamble, and the National Association of Broadcasters and El Paso Natural Gas. El Paso hired Hill and Knowlton to drum up support for legislation that would allow El Paso to buy out its competitor, Pacific Northwest Pipeline Company. In 1967, Gray joined the 50-person committee responsible for charting Richard Nixon's path to the White House. After Nixon was elected president, Gray would often escort Nixon's personal assistant, Rose Mary Woods to official functions. After serving as deputy director of the Reagan-Bush presidential campaign, in 1980, Gray became Reagan's first appointment as president when Gray was named co-chairman of Ronald Reagan‚Äôs Presidential inauguration. During the Reagan Administration, Gray started his own firm, Gray and Company, in 1981. When he took the firm public in 1985, it became the first public relations-public affairs firm to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Three years later, he sold majority interest in the firm to Hill & Knowlton and became H&K;'s Worldwide Chairman. In 1988, as one of his last acts as president, Reagan flew to Gray's hometown, Hastings, Nebraska, to dedicate a communications center Gray had given to Hastings College in honor of his parents. Notable clients of Gray and Company included Adnan Khashoggi, Saudi Arabian billionaire and arms dealer, the government of Haiti under the Duvalier dynasty, American commodities trader and financier Marc Rich (who in 1983 was indicted for trading with Iran during the hostage crisis and a variety of other charges, fled the country, and was later granted a pardon by President Bill Clinton), the Teamsters Union, and Korean religious leader Sun Myung Moon. Gray‚Äôs first book, Eighteen Acres Under Glass: Life in Washington As Seen By the Former Secretary of the Cabinet, was published in 1962 by Doubleday in the States and by MacMillan overseas. Eventually becoming number four on The Times best-seller list, the book highlighted the demands on both his political and social life as the Secretary of the Cabinet under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. With tales from the visits with kings and queens to the extended hours spent with the Chief Executive, the book gives an inner look at the functions and sometimes dysfunctions of Washington. Gray was featured in cover stories in Time magazine and U.S. News & World Report, and was the subject of a fifteen-minute Monitor program on NBC. The 1992 book, The Power House: Robert Keith Gray and the Selling of Access and Influence in Washington by Susan B. Trento, \\"tells how Mr. Gray, after unabashedly peddling access for decades, reached the apex of his influence when his friend Ronald Reagan moved into the White House.\\" In 2012 Gray's book Presidential Perks Gone Royal: Your Tax Dollars Are Being Used For Obama's Re-Election was published by New Voices Press.

He was considered one of the China Hands: United States State Department officials attacked during McCarthyism in the 1950s for \\"losing China\\" to the Communists. Background Oliver Edmund Clubb was born on February 16, 1901, in South Park, Minnesota. His father was a cattle rancher. He had one brother (surviving at his time of death), Lester Clubb. During World War I, he enlisted age 17 for military service and later studied international law at the University of Washington and the University of Minnesota. Career In 1928, Clubb passed the Foreign Service exam. In 1929, he received his first assignment to Beijing. Clubb spent two decades in government service as a member of the American Foreign Diplomatic Corps. On December 5, 1941 (two days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor), Clubb, then in Indochina, found himself seized by occupying Japanese forces and held, first for two months in solitary confinement, then another six months, and finally exchanged for Japanese held by the Allies. With the exception of a brief period in Washington, Mr. Clubb spent the rest of the war and the immediate postwar period in the Soviet Far East, Manchuria and China. During World War II, he served in Chunking and Sianking province and then Vladivostok in 1944. Posts following the war included cities in Manchuria. In 1949, his last overseas station was Beijing in 1949, where he was consul general as the U.S. left the country during the Communist takeover by Mao Zedong. Clubb returned to Washington, DC, where he took over as chief of State's China desk. In 1950 (or 1951), U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy investigated and condemned Clubb; the State Department Loyalty Board suspended him as a security risk. One cause for his suspension was the recollection of Whittaker Chambers, who, as part of FBI inquiries related to the Hiss Case, had recalled Clubb's visit in 1932 to the offices of the New Masses (where Chambers was an editor). (In his 1952 memoir, Witness, Chambers claimed \\"I had not intended to divulge the messenger's name.\\" ) Clubb was delivering a letter from Agnes Smedley, a well- known left-wing American journalist in China. Clubb denied any knowledge of any wrongdoing by delivering the letter (whose contents he did not know). A second cause, also in 1932, was a report he made that the Chinese Communists were strong and popular in many regions, while the Chinese Nationalists were corrupt‚Äìalthough the Nationalists might force the Communists to flee west (predicting the Long March, \\"later to be cited by his critics as evidence of his pro-Communist leanings.\\" Clubb won an appeal for reinstatement but then resigned as he decided that \\"his career was finished.\\" He was one of four China Hands dismissed or who resigned from State: John Paton Davies, Jr., John S. Service, John Carter Vincent. Personal and death Clubb married Mariann E. H. Smith; they had one daughter and one son.

Curtis bought the script in March 1971 for their production company, Curtwel Productions. \\"She was a huge star at the time, and that meant if she wanted to do it, the movie would get made\\", said Sandler. \\"I believe that he had me in mind when he wrote it\\", said Welch. \\"The girl is more than a little bitchy.\\" Sandler says the original script was very different to what the movie became: > [It was] a dark, gritty, character piece, more in the vein of Requiem for a > Heavyweight. It's about this young woman from Kansas City who goes out to > Hollywood dreaming of fame and fortune, making it in the movies, and she's > really not good enough to do so, but she's desperate to make her name and to > get attention. She struggles and struggles, and never makes it, and then one > day, she meets this kind of beat up, bruised up, burnt-out ex roller derby > queen who kind of takes her under her wing and coaches her, and tries to get > her involved in the roller derby. It sort of shows her becoming a roller > derby star, and the irony is that she makes it in the roller derby, but as a > black-trophy ... as a bad girl who gets hissed at, beat up, and spit on > every week. The irony is that she is able to find the stardom she > desperately yearned for, but not as a movie star--as a star on the roller > derby track getting booed at and spit at every week. And so it's kind of > dark, and much grittier and different, kind of almost along the lines of > Midnight Cowboy. The film was originally going to be made at Warner Bros, then at United Artists. Eventually Welch divorced Curtis and made the film for her own company in association with Artists Entertainment Complex and Levy-Gardner- Laven. The film was part-financed and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, whose president, James T. Aubrey, was romantically linked with Welch for a time. Over the course of moving from studio to studio, the script was heavily rewritten. Many felt the final screenplay mirrored the life of legendary Roller Derby star, Ann Calvello, who in 1953, divorced her husband, left her young daughter with her ex-husband's family while she returned to the skating world to make a living, something which was unheard of during the 1950s. The screenplay perfectly embodied Calvello's real life struggles. Sandler later said if the film had been made at Warner Bros, \\"they would have stuck to\\" the original conception: > Warner Brothers was a much more adventurous studio at the time. They were > making The Devils and A Clockwork Orange, Performance ... they stuck with > those kinds of movies. ... MGM wanted to sell Raquel Welch in a tight roller > derby jersey, running around the track. Listen, they weren't stupid, they > were smart to do that. It certainly made them a lot of money, and it would > have been a much riskier project to go the other way. They weren't sure > whether Raquel could pull it off. I think she could have, but they wanted to > play it much safer and go with a much more straight-on roller derby story. > So, the film was made like that, and I think it's pretty good, but it's a > different kind of movie than the version I envisioned. Raquel Welch discussed her character in detail to the press: > The motivation of the character I play is simply to make a buck in life and > to attain a sense of identity. There's a futility in what she does. The > shape of the track is her life, round and round, going nowhere. But the > pros, the real skaters who worked with me, they were terrific. Most of them > suffer from the same image I do. They're on skates, they're padded up, > they're on a raised track. Most people tend to think of these girls as > Amazons. But most of them are even smaller than me. They're not as muscular > or as butch as you'd expect. I have a similar problem. Most people are > disappointed if the door hinges don't shatter off when I walk into a room. \\"It's all set up, as everyone knows\\", said Welch of skating. \\"It's too bad it couldn't be a more legitimate sport. The skaters have great athletic ability. I'm not much of an athlete ... For the film I had to learn to skate again. I hadn't skated since I was seven.\\" Filming Filming was to have started in February 1972. Welch practiced skating for several months, training with pro teams, wearing a wig and dark glasses and posing as a journalist looking into a story. In January a rink was constructed on the MGM soundstage, enabling Welch to practise daily. She broke her right wrist during a speed skating session, forcing shooting to be put back eight weeks until April. Filming took place in Portland, Oregon. Two weeks into the shoot Welch suffered a cut lip and swollen face during a fight scene with co-star Helena Kallianiotes. An MGM spokesman said the two actors \\"got carried away\\" and Welch \\"got slugged\\". Welch later said she also bruised her knees, got a spasm in her trapezius, had some hematomas on her head, and suffered several headaches. The film used real-life stars of the National Skating Derby, Roller Games, as uncredited extras, such as Patti Cavin ('Big Bertha' Bogliani), Judy Arnold, Ralph Valladares, Ronnie Rains, Judy Sowinski, Richard Brown, Tonette Kadrmas and John Hall. Real roller derby venues in Kansas City, Fresno, and Portland were also used for key scenes.Kansas City Bomber at Turner Classic Movies \\"The film was fun\\", said Welch. \\"I like to be in physical pictures. And the Roller Games is a microcosm of this country, the kind of thing we create.\\" She elaborated: > The game is almost show business, it's a carnival atmosphere, but I can > understand its popularity. Most of the spectators are basic people and > there's something cathartic about watching people get dumped. The yelling > creates a certain kind of intensity. The type of violence draws you in, > makes you involved. The skaters are tough but I think all women are tough. > The skaters aren't any tougher than most of the women in the world, > underneath. Skating is a batchy, sweaty, funky life. I don't want to do > another film about it. I've done my number. But I enjoyed it. Welch later said this was the first of her films that she actually liked.  Soundtrack  The songwriter Phil Ochs wrote a song of the same title; he had intended it as title song for the film, but it was rejected by Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. Ochs had A&M; Records issue the song as a single anyway. He hoped to publicly debut the song at the Los Angeles Thunderbirds' track during a Roller Games television taping at Los Angeles' Olympic Auditorium, for many of the Thunderbirds skaters had appeared in the movie as extras, and announcer Dick Lane had a small speaking role; however, Thunderbirds owner Bill Griffiths Sr. likewise rejected that idea. Don Ellis contributed the score of the film. Reception Box office James Aubrey later claimed the film was one of MGM's most successful releases of 1972, after Shaft and Skyjacked. The success of the film caused the share price of Artist Entertainment Complex to rise. Barry Sandler says the film was profitable and proved lucrative for him. Critical response Roger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote that: > Jerrold Freedman has directed \\"Kansas City Bomber\\" with an eye to hard- > hitting action and gutsy detail. But I don't think his eye is really sharp > enough or fast enough or even wide enough open.

Arthur Murphy of Variety wrote, \\"Raquel Welch stars in one of her most effective roles to date. Rugged, brawling action will more than satisfy those who enjoy that type of commercial carnage, while the script explores deftly the cynical manipulation of players and audiences.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and thought it was \\"more than good fun. It's a gas.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times thought Welch \\"comes through with a characterization as unexpected as it is persuasive\\" and said the film \\"is a well observed slice of contemporary Americana\\" which \\"marks Raquel Welch's coming of age as an actress and is a personal triumph for her after surviving more rotten movies than anyone would care to remember.\\"Thomas, Kevin (August 23, 1972). \\"Raquel Welch Stars as 'Bomber' Champ\\". g13. Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that for \\"a few minutes\\" the film was \\"fast, furious and funny\\", until the \\"dismally scripted\\" film turned serious. Joyce Haber called it one of the worst films of 1972.  Awards and honors  Helena Kallianiotes was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture. Legacy The film was heavily publicized during filming. This inspired Roger Corman to finance an exploitation film set in the world of roller derbies, Unholy Rollers.author=Welch sent up the film as part of her Las Vegas act in late 1972. Welch later said she was \\"good\\" in the film just as she was good in Myra Breckenridge and The Last of Sheila, \\"but being good in a bad film doesn't do anything for your career.\\" In 1978 she said the film was one of the few in her career with which she was happy, the others being L'Animal and The Three Musketeers.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York. Life and work Gilden was born in Brooklyn, New York. While studying sociology at Penn State, he saw Michelangelo Antonioni's film Blowup in 1968. Influenced by the film, he purchased his first camera and began taking night classes in photography at the School of Visual Arts of New York. Fascinated with people on the street and the idea of visual spontaneity, Gilden turned to a career in photography. His work is characterized by his use of flash photography. He has worked in black and white most of his life, but he began shooting in color and digital when he was introduced to the Leica S camera as part of Magnum's Postcards From America project. Gilden has been a member of Magnum Photos since 1998. His first major project was of people at Coney Island.\\"Coney Island \\", Magnum Photos. He has photographed people on the streets of New York, Japan's yakuza mobsters, homeless people, prostitutes, and members of bike gangs between 1995 and 2000. According to Gilden, he was fascinated by the duality and double lives of the individuals he photographed. He has also photographed rural Ireland and horseracing there, as well as voodoo rituals in Haiti. Gilden is the subject of the documentary film Misery Loves Company: The Life and Death of Bruce Gilden (2007). Reception Gilden has described the way he photographs as ‚Äúflash in one hand and jumping at people‚Äù. Sean O'Hagan, reviewing Gilden's Face (2015) in The Guardian wrote that \\"his style seems to work against any intention to humanise his subjects.\\" Contemporary American photographer Joel Meyerowitz has this to say about Gilden: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a fucking bully.

A multigene haplotype is set of inherited alleles covering several genes, or gene-alleles; common multigene haplotypes are generally the result of descent by common ancestry (share a recent common ancestor for that segment of the chromosome). Chromosomal recombination fragments multigene haplotypes as the distance to that ancestor increases in number of generations. The haplotype can be written in an extended form covering the major histocompatibility loci as follows: > HLA A*0101 : Cw*0701 : B*0801 : DRB1*0301 : DQA1*0501 : DQB1*0201 or > shorthand A1::DQ2 There are many other gene-alleles within the haplotype, including more than 250 coding loci that produce transcripts. At 4.7 million nucleotides in length, A1::DQ2 is the second longest haplotype identified within the human genome. A1::DQ2 creates a conundrum for the evolutionary study of recombination. The length of the haplotype is remarkable because of the rapid rate of evolution at the HLA locus should degrade such long haplotypes. A1::DQ2's origin is difficult to trace, suggestions of a common ancestor in Iberia or Africa have been put forward. Although its place of origin is not certain there is agreement that bearers of the European AH8.1 bear a haplotype related by a common descent. A1::DQ2 is the most frequent haplotype of its length found in US Caucasians, ~15% carry this common haplotype. Studies indicate that A1::DQ2 prominence is likely due to positive selection in the pre-Neolithic period and isolation in countries where wheat was not a prominent cereal. Outside of DR3-DQ2 with known associations to autoimmune disease, other factors within A1::DQ2 are believed to also contribute to autoimmune disease. Also a dozen inflammatory diseases of the immune system can attribute some risk to the haplotype. Some disease like coeliac disease primarily associate with certain genes. While other diseases, like type 1 diabetes may have several, highly different, genes that attribute risk. Still other diseases, like myasthenia gravis have undetermined linkage to the haplotype. Recombination dynamics Each person has unique chromosomes, unless they are identical twins. These unique chromosomes are produced by recombination of each unique chromosome passed by each grandparent to each parent. These chromosome chimerize within the reproductive cells of each parent which are then passed to the developing person during fertilization. The recombination that creates these blended chromosomes occurs almost randomly along the length, 1 Morgan per generation. Within 100 generations in humans (about 2100 years in ancient times) one expects a few hundred of these 'blending' events to have occurred across a single chromosome, the average size is 1 centiMorgan (or 1 cM). The average length of these 'haplotypes' are about 1 million nucleotides. Multigene haplotypes following standard dynamics only exist in robust populations for a short time, the average distance between genes of about 200,000 nts, which means that over 250 generations (~5000 years) one expects 1/2 of adjacent genes to have new gene-alleles, unless the genes are small and very close together. This dynamic can change if the population expands rapidly from a few individuals that lived in isolation as long as other haplotypes are maintained. A1::DQ2 does not follow the expected dynamics. Other haplotypes exist in the region of Europe where this haplotype formed and expanded, some of these haplotypes also are ancestral and also are quite large. At 4.7 million nucleotides in length and ~300 genes the locus had resisted the effects of recombination, either as a consequence of recombination-obstruction within the DNA, as a consequence of repeated selection for the entire haplotype, or both. Structure A1::DQ2 is 4,731,878 nucleotides in length. The haplotype begins before the locus approximately 28.8 million nucleotides from the telomere of chromosome 6's shorter arm. AH8.1 extends past the about 33.5 million nucleotides from the telomer. Marked deterioration occurs however after the DQB1 gene at 32.8 million nucleotides. A1::DQ2 is not the longest haplotype, but the longest, HLA A3-Cw7-B7-DR15-DQ6 (A3::DQ6), had already undergone significant recombination and is nearly equal in frequency to HLA A2-Cw7::DQ6 bearing version. In the US Caucasians, 57% of haplotypes with a core component, Cw7-B8, extend from HLA-A1 locus to DQ2 locus. This compares with 25% of Cw7-B7 that extend to A3::DQ6 Of 25 potential genetic recombinants of A1::DQ2, none exceed 10% of the Cw*0702-B*0801 frequency. Two recombinants A24-Cw7~DQ2, A1::B8-DR1-DQ5 are notable. Thus, A1::DQ2 haplotype is both long and shows greater deficiency of recombination (called linkage disequilibrium). Evolution The evolution of A1::DQ2 appears to be key to its structure. The haplotype, at 4.7 million nucleotide, exists in a population with other haplotypes which, when combined, exceed A1::DQ2 in frequency. Genetics of recombination in humans suggests that common haplotypes of this length that Cw7-B8 component should be in other haplotypes, Ax-Cw7::DQ2, A1-B8-DRx-DQx, or A1-B8-DR3-DQx (where Ax is not A1, DRx is not DR3, or DQx is not DQ2). For a haplotype of this length the process is fast, 50% loss of the complete haplotype within 500 years. And yet the haplotype is found largely intact in people who settled out of Europe hundreds of years ago. =Resistance to recombination= A1::DQ2 is found in Iceland, Pomors of Northern Russia, the Serbians of Northern Slavic descent, Basque, and areas of Mexico where Basque settled in larger numbers. The haplotypes great abundance in the most isolated geographic region of Western Europe, Ireland, in Scandinavians and Swiss suggests that low abundance in France and Latinized Iberia are the result of displacements that took place after the Neolithic onset. This implies a founding presence in Europe that exceeds 8000 years. The SNP analysis of the haplotype suggests a potential founding effect of 20,000 years within Europe, though conflicts in interpreting this information are now apparent. The last possible point of a constriction forcing climate was the Younger Dryas before 11,500 calendar years ago, and so the haplotype has taken on various forms of the name, Ancestral European Haplotype, lately called Ancestral Haplotype A1-B8 (AH8.1). It is one of 4 that appear common to western Europeans and other Asians. Assuming that the haplotype frequency was 50% at the Younger Dryas and declined by 50% every 500 years the haplotypes should only be present below 0.1% in any European population. Therefore, it exceeds the expected frequency for a founding haplotype by almost 100 fold. =Diet in Evolution= Beyond frequent interpretations of this nature, little more is known as to why the haplotype has not undergone equilibration. The haplotype appears to be recombination resistant, it appears to also have been under positive selection relative to other haplotypes in Europe, although currently disease instances suggest cereal-based negative selection is acting. One possible explanation comes from the study of remains of the pre-Neolithic period. Given food selects the haplotype now, might food have also positively selected the haplotype in the past. During the early period of European settlement, what remains of coastal settlements suggests a high marine-based food calorie intake, and, in particular, shellfish. Marine carbon component of Western European diet has declined from the Mesolithic to present, however the haplotype has not undergone equilibration, therefore diet alone cannot explain its resistance to recombination. =Formation= Of the haplotypes mentions above, A24-Cw*0702::DQ2 or A1::B8-DR1-DQ5, none appear to be ancestral to A1::DQ2. An A1::DQ2 appears in India, however its major antigen genes superficially resemble European A1-B8 and it appears to be a homoplastic recombinant from a common DR3-DQ2 ancestor, about 70,000 years ago. Components of the haplotype are found in Europe (Basque have two major haplotypes of DR3-DQ2) and A1-B8 of Indian origin is of very low frequency. In Morocco B8::DQ2, in the Western Sahara A1-B8 haplotype if found and also DQ2.5 is found in high frequency, but not as a single haplotype. In Kenya two slightly variant HLA-A and B alleles for an A1-B8 haplotype. One possibility is that peoples from central Asia or the Middle East migrated into Iberia as peoples from Africa crossed into Iberia from the south prior to the Neolithic, recombination occurred resulting in the haplotype, and bearers favorably expanded into Europe prior to the Holocene. Another possibility is that if formed in West Africa, but because it was less selective in African holocene relative to European holocene climate/culture, the haplotype underwent equilibration in N. Africa. One hypothesis supported by frequencies in Iberia and North Africa suggest that A1::DQ2 formed from A1::B8-DR7-DQ2 with DR3 bearing source. One possible source is the HLA Cw*1701 : B*4201 : DRB1*0302 (The most common haplotype in African Americans is an extended haplotype) However possible, it would require the introduction of a modified *0505 allele. In addition, the Indian/European branch of DQ2.5 is much older, thus it appears at least 2 major recombinant steps were required to form the haplotype, and after its formation evolution markedly slowed down. Variants There is a variant of A1‚Üê‚ÜíB8 found in India. This variant carries the different Cw*07 (Cw*0702 is a very ancient allele that differs from Cw*0701 of A1::DQ2). It bears C4A a different DRB3 allele as well as numbers of other differences. This variant likely evolved from A24 or A26-Cw*0702-B*0801-DR3-DQ2 that independently arrived and evolved in India. Components Large haplotypes can be thought of as steps between adjacent loci. For example, A1-Cw*0701, Cw*0701-B8, B8 to DR3, and DR3-DQ2 are each steps. Each step is a haplotype in its own right, however, the closer two loci are together, the longer it takes recombination to alter the step. Both Cw-B and DR-DQ are close together, A-Cw and B-DR are far apart. As a result, components of a haplotype evolve at different paces. =A1-Cw7-B8= Early studies of families across Europe recognized what most HLA associations had already shown, that there is an inherited (genetic) linkage between A1 and B1, this was extended to Cw7 locus. And while the level of A-B linkage in general was nowhere near Cw-B linkage, the linkage between A1-Cw7-B8 was reasonably strong. =B8-DR3= The region between and including B8 and DR3 bears a number of genes of interest in the study of human disease. Most important of which is the TNF (tumor necrosis factors) with 3 loci in the region. Starting from B8, immediately followed by the MICA and MICB which stand for MHC I-like chain A and B. These two functional class I molecules are expressed on intestinal interocytes and may have interest in autoimmune disease, they are variable, but the MICA mutants so-far found do not seem to correlate with autoimmune diseases of the GI tract. =HLA DR3-DQ2= DR3-DQ2 is either a known or highly suspect factor in most autoimmune diseases that link to the A1::DQ2 haplotype. Importance to Medicine In organ transplantion A1::DQ2 was at the forefront of histocompatibility science, A1 was the first numerical antigen HL-A1 identified in the late 1960s. HL-A8 the second refined B-serotype to be uncovered became HLA-B8. Because of the frequency of the haplotype, homozygotes are common, about 0.6% if the population, make it useful for making cell lines that can be used to test serotyping antibodies. As a result, HLA-A1 and B8 produce some of the best serotyping antibodies. This aided in the proper identification of transplant matches prior to the era of PCR-gene testing. In coeliac disease & dermatitis herpetiformis Prior to refined typing for HLA-DQ and DR, the association with HLA-A1 and B8 was identified for coeliac disease in 1973 and dermatitis herpetiformis in 1976 . Because of the haplotype it became possible to identify the genetic risk even though disease causing genes, a DQ2 haplotype, was 1.3 million nucleotides away. Aside from the highly studied link between DQ2.5 and coeliac disease, there are additional risk factors on the B8::DQ2 haplotype that increase risk of dermatitis herpetiformis in coeliac disease. The involvement of other A1::DQ2 gene-alleles in coeliac disease cannot be excluded, either. For example, MICA and MICB are mhc class 1 genes found expressed in the epithelium of the gut. In insulin dependent diabetes mellitus In type 1 diabetes both DR3 and DQ2 appear to play a role. DR3-DQ2.5 can be established to other genes like TNF-305A (TNF2) which may also increase the risk of autoimmune disease in both Coeliac Disease and Type 1 diabetes. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients HLA DR3-DQ2.5-C4AQ0, which was strongly associated with SLE (odds ratio [OR] 2.8, 95% CI 1.7-4.5). A more recent paper shows that Inositol triphosphate receptor 3 gene which is ~ 1 million base pairs centromeric from DQ2.5 may also be associated with Type 1 diabetes. In addition the BAT1 and MICB variant is more common in type 1 diabetes when B8 is absent but DR3 is present These studies suggest multiple factors on B8::DQ2 that are possessed by other haplotypes also confer susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes has a risk associated with coxsackie 4B virus, there is a potential for involvement of class I loci, particularly those expressed in the GI tract. In myasthenia gravis In 1975, association with \\"HL-A1,8\\" (Current name: HLA A1-B8) was confirmed by serological typing of cells from myasthenics. However, in a larger sample the risk association was found closer to \\"HL-A8\\" (Current name: HLA-B8). This association later migrated to the \\"B8-DRw3\\" (Current: B8-DR3) region. There are two major DR3 haplotypes in Europe, A1::DQ2 and A30-B18-DR3-DQ2. Linkage with disease could more firmly be attributed to B8::DQ2 portion of A1::DQ2 relative to A30-B18::DQ2, indicating some involvement of other B8-DR3 gene-alleles in disease. The association of the B8::DQ2 region is primarily seen in females with age-relative thymic hyperplasia. Later the level of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies in disease were found to correlate with B8::DR3. Later it was found that both DQ2.5 and DQ2.2(A DQ haplotype of DR7-DQ2) were positively associated with disease. There remains controversy over whether DR3 or DQ2 confers primary susceptibility to myasthenia gravis. In some studies no association with either has been observed. To segregate disease groups have attempted to further define population to earliest onset (presumbably most susceptibility) and females. In these studies link with B8 was greater than DR3, so that susceptibility moves from class II to Class III or Class I loci. The association with class I would be unusual since T-helper mediated autoantibody production is characteristic of disease, whereas class I mediated cytotoxicity is not. MICA and MICB are intestinally expressed. There are many genes that lie on either side of HLA-B, TNF alpha is over expressed. Closer to DR3, C4A is null in B8-DR3 haplotype. In autoimmune hepatitis In 1972, a link between \\"HLA A1,8\\" (current:HLA A1-B8) active chronic hepatitis, subsequently B8 better associated with autoimmune hepatitis. With the discovery of DR3, the linkage was extended to DR3 and subsequently to DQ2-DP4. While HLA A*0101, Cw*0701, and DPB1*0402 are linked to disease, the strongest association locates between B8 and DR3-DQ2, or the B8::DQ2 subregion. Other genes in the region, C4A-null and TNF may associated with autoimmune hepatitis The appearance of anti-nuclear antibodies in autoimmune hepatitis was found to correlated with A1-B8-DR3. One of the problems with autoimmune hepatitis is there is an increased risk in coeliac disease. Primary biliary cirrhosis which often follows chronic active hepatitis is linked to \\"DRw3\\", DR3, gene. Celiac disease is often increased in autoimmune hepatitis and vice versa. Recent studies indicate a more insidious association between gluten sensitivity and autoimmune hepatitis. In one study 65% of patients with end stage autoimmune hepatitis had coeliac associated HLA-DQ (DQ2, DQ8), of these half had anti- transglutaminase antibodies, but few had endomysial antibody. This could indicate an association with subclinical enteropathy, or alternatively the result of chronic viral infection which is known to also elevate anti- tranglutaminase antibody. A German study found that risk was more associated with B8 than DQ2, these conflicting results indicate that there are at least two risk associations in the B8::DQ2 region. In sarcoidosis Like these other studies a link between \\"HL-A1,8\\" eventually leads to susceptibility close to the DR-DQ locus, Sarcoidosis appears to link to HLA-DR3-DQ2. In systemic lupus erythromatosus The \\"HL-A1,8 phenotype\\" was found to be associated with severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (renal and central nervous system involvement) in Caucasian patients. Two-point haplotype analysis between TNFB(B*01 allele) and HLA show that the allele is in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-A1, Cw7, B8, C4A(Null), DR3, DQ2.5. The entire haplotype, A1-Cw7-B8-TNFB*1-C4A(Null)-DR3-DQ2, is increased in patients and the genetic susceptibility to SLE cannot be distinguished. Linkage could not be extended to HLA-DPB1 locus. Outside of Europe the DRB1*0301 and DR3-DQ2 loci have been linked to disease independently of A1::DQ2 haplotype. DR3 is found to correlate with anti-Ro/La antibodies in SLE. In inclusion body myositis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis HLA-DR3 has been consistently observed at high frequencies in inclusion body myositis in caucasians. DR3 was found to correlate also with Jo-1 antiboidy presence. Studies of sporadic inclusion body myositis indicate association with A1:DQ2 haplotype. More recent studies indicate that risk lies solely between B8-DR3 region, this includes 3 class I genes, the class III gene region, and 2 class II genes. Research published in October 2015 by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences compared 1,710 cases of either adult- or juvenile-onset myositis, with 4,724 control subjects. They found that multiple genes that make up AH8.1 define the genetic risk for all types of myositis.

The books center around the lives of five different preteens, and eventually teenage girls who become best friends because of the book club that their mothers start. The girls live in a slightly fictionalized Concord, Massachusetts. Characters  Emma Hawthorne - A known bookworm whose mother is the local librarian, and whose father is a published author, Emma starts off the series shy and reserved. Later on she takes up ice skating and bonds with her coach, while also dating Stewart Chadwick and practicing writing. Her respective book is the fourth in the series, Pies and Prejudice. Jess Delaney - The brains of the group and Emma's best friend, Jess's family owns Half Moon Farm and is riddled with financial problems. Her mother is a former actress who retires to work on the farm when it causes a rift between her and the family. Later in the series, she begins attending a local boarding school on an academic scholarship, and dates Emma's popular older brother Darcy. The first book in the series, The Mother-Daughter Book Club, centers around her. Megan Wong - A seemingly stereotypical rich girl, Megan used to be friends with the popular girls before joining the book club, and is embarrassed by her mother who \\"gives their money away\\" to charities and is open about her vegan lifestyle. Megan's main hobby is fashion design, and dates british exchange student Simon Berkeley. She eventually attends Parsons College in New York City for a BFA in Fashion. The novels where she is the main focus are the third and sixth books Dear Pen Pal and Wish You Were Eyre. Becca Chadwick - While a general mean girl in the first book, her mother Calliope forces her to join the book club in the second and she slowly forms a reluctant bond with the rest of the girls. Stubborn and boy crazy, Becca later becomes a waitress at the tea shop owned by Megan's grandmother, and attends the University of Minnesota with her boyfriend Theo Rochester. The book which centers around her is the Christmas special and fifth book in the series, Home for the Holidays. Cassidy Sloane - Recently moved to Concord from California after her father died, Cassidy lives in the shadow of her mother Clementine, a famous former model who later remarries and gets her own cooking show. Unlike her mother and her sister, Cassidy is a tomboy who plays ice hockey, and despite not being nearly as interested in boys as the rest of the book club, gets with both Zach Norton and Simon's brother Tristian Berkeley over the course of the series. The second book in the series, Much Ado About Anne, is mainly about her.  Plot   Middle School  In the first book in the series, The Mother-Daughter Book Club, the book club is formed by the mothers while all of the girls are in sixth grade. They become friends over the course of it and help Jess get her parents back together while reading Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. In Much Ado About Anne, they read Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery, and struggle with the mother's decision to let Becca Chadwick into the book club. Meanwhile, Cassidy and her older sister Courtney discover that their mother has begun dating again, and Jess tries to keep her parents from selling Half Moon Farm. In the third book Dear Pen Pal, the mothers set the girls up to be pen pals with another mother daughter book club in Wyoming, whom they visit at the end of the book, and read Daddy Long Legs by Jean Webster. Jess transfers to a prestigious boarding school, Colonial Academy, at her parents insistence after being offered an anonymous scholarship and clashes with her stuck up southern roommate Savannah Sinclair, but also joins the schools a cappella group. Megan's grandmother Gigi moves in with them and Cassidy learns her mother is pregnant.  High School  The girls enter high school in Pies and Prejudice as Emma's family prepares to move to England for a year and swap houses with the Berkeley family. The book club continues over video call as they read Jane Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice. Jess begins rehabilitating wild animals, Emma develops a rivalry with the \\"British Becca\\" Annabelle, Megan starts an anonymous fashion blog and a romance with Simon Berkeley, while Cassidy enters a Elizabeth/Darcy esque dynamic with Simon's figure skating brother Tristian and helps out with a hockey program called Chicks with Sticks. The book ends with Megan's grandmother Gigi opening a tea shop called Pies and Prejudice. In the following book, Home for the Holidays, instead of taking place over the course of a year like the preceding books, it takes place over only a month during the girls sophomore year, when they read the Betsy-Tacy series by Maud Hart Lovelace and participate in Secret Santa. It is also the first book in the series to include chapter's from Becca's perspective, whose dad is laid off before she is set to visit her grandmother in Minnesota and her mother goes through a midlife crisis. Megan goes on a tropical cruise, and Jess is set to go on a skiing trip with Savannah, until she injures her leg in a sledding accident and is forced to spend Christmas with Emma, who is angry at her for wanting to go on the trip. Cassidy competes in a hockey tournament, tries to ward off the affections of Zach Norton, and deal with Becca who is jealous of her relationship with Zach. Wish You Were Eyre, wherein the girls read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront√´, begins with the Wong's accepting a French exchange student named Sophie into their house, who develops a close bond with Gigi that Megan is jealous of. Mrs. Wong runs for mayor with the help of Emma and her boyfriend Stewart. Megan is taken to Paris Fashion Week for her birthday by Gigi, who meets and eventually marries a man named Edouard by the end of the book when they return home. This all takes place during their junior year. The final book in the series, The Mother Daughter Book Camp, follows the girls experience as camp counselors at Camp Lovejoy, located in New Hampshire, the summer before their freshman year of college. Emma is paired up to counselor with Jess's know-it-all cousin Felicia, who drove a wedge between the two in Home for the Holidays, while Jess is left with Cassidy, and Megan co- counselors with Becca. Together with their campers, they read Dorothy Canfield Fisher's Understood Betsy.

It was swift and performed well under both sail and oars. It was probably developed in Bayonne for hunting whales. The ships were used in the conquest of Anglesey in 1282. They were also in use in the 15th and 16th centuries.Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea, p. 55 They were distinguished by their lack of a forecastle, and by carrying either a square sail, or a sail extended on a sprit on a single mast. They were generally less than 100 tons, with a shallow draught, and the earlier vessels at least carried 30 or more oars for use in sheltered areas or for close fighting.Shaping the Nation, p. 88 They were mainly used for coastal trade, but could also be used as transports, carrying around forty soldiers. A number were employed in the early Royal Navy for this purpose.Colledge A statute of 1441 referring to pirate raids on the south coast of England contained a request from the House of Commons of England asking King Henry VI to provide \\"eight ships with four stages, carrying one with the other 150 men each.

He was also part of third incarnation of The Black Harts teaming with David Heath in IWA Japan during the mid-1990s. Career In early 1994, he began appearing in World Championship Wrestling losing to Terry Funk and Bunkhouse Buck in a tag team match with Erik Watts during WCW Worldwide on May 17 and the following week on WCW Saturday Night, teamed with Todd Morton to lose to Pretty Wonderful (Paul Orndorff and Paul Roma) on May 24 after being pinned by Roma. He also lost to Harlem Heat in several matches with Watts, Morton, Brian Armstrong and Buddy Wayne during the next few weeks. On April 4, 1995, Houston lost to \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" Paul Orndorff on WCW Saturday Night in Atlanta, Georgia; during the match, Orndorff appeared to have a black eye as a result of the backstage fight between Orndorff and Big Van Vader earlier that night. Teaming with Frankie Lancaster, the two lost to Colonel Parker's Stud Stable (Bunkhouse Buck and \\"Dirty\\" Dick Slater) a dark match at The Great American Bash held at the Hara Arena in Dayton, Ohio on June 18, 1995. During the next several months, he would become a regular on WCW Saturday Night facing Al Snow, Kamala, The Blacktop Bully, Meng, Kevin Sullivan and Mr. JL in single matches before teaming with Frankie Lancaster and Mark Starr in a 6-man tag team match against The Four Horsemen (Brian Pillman, Arn Anderson and \\"Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair) on Monday Night Nitro on October 30, 1995. After losing to V.K. Wallstreet on November 25, Passmore left WCW the next year and began teaming with David Heath as The Black Harts replacing Tom Nash as Heath's regular tag team partner. Managed by Luna Vachon, Passmore and Heath had a successful run as a gaijin tag team with IWA Japan eventually touring with Heath four more times between June 1996 and May 1997. Houston was praised by wrestler Mick Foley after seeing him at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo on June 4, 1996. The two split after Heath began wrestling for All Japan Pro Wrestling and later for the World Wrestling Federation the following year. On December 27, 1997, Houston himself received a tryout match for the WWF facing Tom Brandi on Shotgun Saturday Night. Briefly returning to WCW, Houston competed in the cruiserweight division against La Parka, Super Calo, El Dandy, Norman Smiley and WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho before again training under Dory Funk, Jr. at the WWF Dojo later during the year. On October 24, 1998, Houston appeared at the NWA 50th Anniversary show in Cherry Hill, New Jersey participating in a 14-man battle royal along with other students of the WWF Dojo including Devon Storm, Steve Corino, Giant Silva, Christopher Daniels, Babu, Teddy Hart, Shawn Stasiak, Glenn Kulka, Andrew Martin, Kurt Angle, Tom Prichard, Tiger Ali Singh and \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams who eventually won the battle royal.

In the book she asks rhetorically, \\"Who are the enemies of the Klan? They are the bootleggers, law-breakers, corrupt politicians, weak-kneed Protestant church members, white slavers, toe-kissers, wafer-worshippers, and every spineless character who takes the path of least resistance.\\" She also argues that Catholics are removing the Bible from public schools. Another topic is her anti-Catholic stance towards the United States presidential election of 1928, in which Catholic Al Smith was running for president. History White was the author of more than 35 books published by the Pillar of Fire Church. In her writings and sermons her political views consisted of a mixture of women's equality, anti-catholicism, antisemitism, racism, nativism and white supremacy. The book is a compendium of essays written by White and of illustrations by Reverend Branford Clarke that were originally published in the pro-Ku Klux Klan political periodical The Good Citizen, one of the numerous periodicals published by the Pillar of Fire Church at their communal headquarters in Zarephath, New Jersey. The book contains an introductory letter of commendation from Hiram Wesley Evans, the then Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Heroes is the final work in a series of three books White published to promote the Klan. The other books were The Ku Klux Klan in Prophecy in 1925, and Klansmen: Guardians of Liberty, in 1926. White republished her Klan books as a three-volume set in 1943, three years before her death and 21 years after her initial association with the Klan, under the title Guardians of Liberty. The book include essays with titles such as Roman Catholic-Hebrew Alliance; Mussolini, Rome, and Reds; and Immigration and White Supremacy. White supremacy Alma White emphatically expresses her sympathy for former slaveowners since they were not compensated for their loss of \\"property\\" following the American Civil War. She expresses her fear and distress toward ongoing racial mixing and uses biblical citations as divine justification for white supremacy.

The object of the suit was to restrain the commission of waste by the defendants pending the outcome of the main action.Erhardt v. Boaro, . It was formerly the doctrine of equity in cases of alleged trespass on land not to restrain the use and enjoyment of the premises by the defendant when the title was in dispute, but to leave the complaining party to his remedy at law. A controversy as to the title was deemed sufficient to exclude the jurisdiction of the court. In Pillsworth v. Hopton, 6 Ves. 51, which was before Lord Eldon in 1801, he is reported to have said that he remembered being told in early life from the bench \\"that if the plaintiff filed a bill for an account and an injunction to restrain waste, stating that the defendant claimed by a title adverse to his, he stated himself out of court as to the injunction.\\" It is common practice in cases where irremediable mischief is being done or threatened going to the destruction of the substance of the estate, such as the extracting of ores from a mine or the cutting down of timber or the removal of coal, to issue an injunction though the title to the premises be in litigation.

All versions were released in North America on 23 June 2009, in Europe on 26 June and Australia on 9 July 2009, alongside two spin-offs; Overlord: Dark Legend and Overlord: Minions for the Wii and the Nintendo DS, respectively. A Linux version was released on 26 July 2016. Continuing the style of the series, players take the role of the Overlord, a mysterious warrior whose goal is to destroy or conquer the land by commanding hordes of small creatures known as \\"Minions\\". The story directly follows the events of the first Overlord game, with the succeeding Overlord rising to power opposing a Roman-styled military power known as the \\"Glorious Empire\\". The story was written by Rhianna Pratchett and maintains a satirical tone and dark humour towards the fantasy setting and genre. Gameplay The core gameplay from the previous Overlord game remains intact in the sequel, with the player controlling the Overlord character in a third-person perspective who has command over hordes of small goblin-like creatures known as minions to travel the landscape and defeat various civilisations with the Roman-style \\"Glorious Empire\\" being the prime foe. Initially only the brown minions are available but eventually the Overlord will regain command of the others that are essential in overcoming obstacles that obstruct further progression of the story. With up to four kinds, each minion type is suited for different purposes such as browns for fighting and blues for healing fallen minions. New features such as minions being able to ride wild animals are utilized to enhance their use by the player in combat. While the Overlord himself can fight in combat with various weapons and armour types that gradually become available and the ability to cast spells to either help minions or hinder opponents, the majority of tasks are performed by the minion hordes. While minions retain many abilities including using scattered items as weaponry and armour, carry large objects in a group, turning cranks and finding treasure, minions can now also operate siege weapons, ships/boats and other war machines and, once captured, can mount and ride wild animals to help in combat and overcome obstacles. The Overlord also has the ability to occasionally take direct control over the current strongest minion to lead the rest through the use of the \\"Possession Stone\\". The Overlord and his minions reside in a dark tower in a dimension known as the \\"Netherworld\\", where the Overlord builds up his minion forces by harvesting life-force from fallen creatures that, when gathered, can be brought back into the real world as a minion by summoning them through Minion Gates scattered across the landscape and through the Overlord himself in the less common Netherworld Gates. Treasure accumulated over time can be spent on upgrades for the tower, whether they're upgrades for gameplay or just decorative, along with large contraptions and magical objects that the minions can be ordered to return to gates, thus the tower. The choice system returns once more in Overlord II, where at certain points during quests that can be taken providing two paths; the Destruction Overlord that focuses on destroying towns and killing all in his path and the Domination Overlord that rather focuses on enslaving defeated foes or neutral parties to worship and work for him. The choice themselves not only affect the story and interactive with non-player characters, but can alter the look of the Overlord and allow certain powers to become available. Other choices such as choosing a mistress allow the Overlord to have multiple mistresses and can (re)designate any to be the primary mistress at any time. Besides the single-player campaign, players can play various multiplayer modes online and local, both competitive and cooperative. Competitive modes includes Dominate, where rival player Overlords attempt to capture sections of the map, and Pillage where they must capture large portions of treasure. Cooperative, on the other hand, sees player Overlords working together to either defend against a constant onslaught in Survival or attack powerful foes in Invasion. Story Characters The new Overlord (left) and Gnarl (right) The silent protagonist Overlord from the first game is not present in Overlord II, as he was trapped in the Abyss dimension at the end of the expansion, Overlord: Raising Hell. Instead, the role of the Overlord is taken up by his child, who was removed from the original Tower to live in a mountain village, but is thrown out by the villagers to appease the Glorious Empire and, on his escape, taken in by the Minions. Gnarl, the aged Minion advisor from the previous games, is the main recurring character in Overlord II. As an adviser and initial tutor, Gnarl engages in most of the game's dialogue, including narration, outlining objectives, dropping hints and even making jokes. Other Characters returning from Overlord include Forge Master Giblet, the minion minstrel Quaver, and the human Rose, mistress of the previous Overlord. With the new Overlord comes the familiar gaggle of minions, grouped into four different sects that have different abilities and strengths: Browns; Reds; Greens; Blues. The Browns are the first sect that the Overlord has at his disposal, and frequently the most useful in any direct combat; they are more robust and can take much more damage than any other minion group, though they are susceptible to fire and poison and they drown in water higher than the Overlord's knee. Reds are the ranged attackers, hurling fireballs at enemies, combustibles and explosives; they have the added ability to remove flame from obstacles and can traverse through fiery obstacles without harm. The Greens are stealth attackers that become invisible if they are stationary, and while close to useless in a direct confrontation (without Browns), they are devastating if planted along a patrols path or if directed to attack an enemy from behind; they are also regarded as the least hygienic group, which somehow makes them immune to poison, allowing them to remove toxic obstacles and walk through toxic clouds. The Blues are medics, virtually non-combative entities that cannot participate in a melee situation alone without sustaining severe casualties, but their ability to resurrect fallen minions makes them valuable; their additional abilities include \\"blinking,\\" removing magical ooze, swimming and an immunity to magic attacks. Characters new to the series include the Overlord's three mistresses: Kelda, a strong willed village girl and the only childhood friend to the Overlord; Juno, a seductive and spoiled Empire maiden; and Queen Fay, leader of the Elves of Everlight before being corrupted by the Overlord. Two new minion masters are also introduced: Mortis, who watches over the minion hives and has the ability to resurrect fallen minion heroes; the hooded keeper of Battle Rock, who organises events in the Overlord's personal arena (though this may be the same minion that stood before the dungeon in the first Overlord). The story's central antagonist is the reclusive Emperor Solarius, ruler of the Glorious Empire, who is committed to conquering the world and removing all magical creatures. While Solarius appears reclusive, he has a number of henchmen who govern the various conquered lands. His second- in-command, Marius, acts as his spokesperson. A secondary antagonist is Florian Greenheart, leader of a band of fanatical environmentalist elves. Plot A generation has passed since the events of the first Overlord, with that game's Overlord now the ruler of the Abyss after being trapped following the events of Raising Hell. The Tower Heart was broken shortly after the old Overlord's disappearance, causing a cataclysm, which destroyed much of the old land and started a magical plague. When the survivors fled to new lands, the Glorious Empire came into being and it began to take control of the new lands, while purging all magical creatures. The old Overlord's mistress gives birth to his child, the \\"Overlad\\". The Mistress then takes the child to the mountain village of Nordberg and leaves him to grow up there, where all of the villagers (except a girl named Kelda, the Overlad's only friend) fear him, referring to him as \\"Witch-Boy\\". The brown minions find him and help cause local havoc. When the Glorious Empire besieges Nordberg, the villagers offer him up to save the town. A yeti, having been freed by the Overlord during his escape, rushes over an ice-covered lake, causing the ice sheet to break, freezing both the Overlord and the yeti until the Minions take him to the Netherworld. The Overlad is raised by Gnarl and the minions as the new Overlord while the Glorious Empire expands its borders. Upon coming of age and passing Gnarl's tests, the Overlord scouts the Nordberg countryside with the Brown Minions, encountering a band of fanatical environmentalist elves led by Florian Greenheart, who try to prevent him from slaying baby seals, and end up taking in the yeti. Tracking the elves to one of their many Sanctuaries, the Overlord recovers the Red Minions, and uses them to destroy the Sanctuary, earning the wrath of the elven Queen Fay. The actions of the Glorious Empire lead Gnarl to classify them as a serious threat, and the Overlord heads out to both conquer the world and destroy the Empire. This begins with the Overlord capturing Nordberg, taking a now adult Kelda as his first mistress, and choosing to either enslave or destroy the village, along with an Empire governor named Borius. After melting the glaciers to free up a sailing ship, the Overlord and his horde travel to the flooded Everlight Reef, so they may access the elven lands of Everlight. On arriving, the Overlord finds that Everlight has already been captured by the Empire, with the town being used as aresort by Empire nobles. After finding the Green Minions in the jungle and recovering the Green Hive from a nearby Empire fort, the Overlord takes control of Everlight, taking Juno (a seductress accused of being a witch by other Empire women) as a second mistress, and either kills or enslaves the town's inhabitants. Juno tells the Overlord how to access the Empire's interior territories, but while attempting to sneak in as a local governor, the Overlord falls into the slums. While exploring the slums, the Overlord comes across the Arena, a large Colosseum-like structure where magical beings are killed in gladiator-based games. The Blue Minions are rediscovered in the prisons underneath the Arena, but, before he can escape, the Overlord is apprehended by Marius, adviser to Emperor Solarius and thrown into the Arena. The Overlord defeats the waves of opponents including the yeti from before, in the process destroying a portion of the arena. Although Solarius and Marius flee, the Blue Hive is recovered, and the player has the option of either capturing the yeti, or killing it. Back at the Netherworld tower, the Overlord is visited by a mysterious woman who Gnarl vaguely recognises. The Overlord travels to the Wastelands (the site of the old Overlord's tower), and is tasked by Gnarl with finding the twelve shards of the Tower Heart. After encountering the elves' final Sanctuary, Queen Fay and Florian help the Overlord to reassemble the Tower Heart while Florian is captured by the Empire after leading the Overlord to the shards, and Fay regretfully allows the Overlord to drain four shrines to power up the Tower Heart. As this is not enough, the Overlord then drains Fay of her magical energy, corrupting her and taking her as his third mistress. With the Tower Heart restored, the Overlord lays siege to the Empire's capital by catapulting the Heart itself into the city's anti-magic barrier. While laying waste to the city temples, the Overlord is confronted once again by the mysterious woman who is revealed to be Rose, the old Overlord's mistress. She reveals that the Empire was to bring order to the land for balance between good and evil, but Solarius let the power go to his head. Upon storming the palace, Florian appears, but reveals that he is, in reality, Solarius. Because he was an elf, but of a non-magical variety, he attempted to harness the power of the abandoned Tower Heart, but instead caused the Cataclysm and inadvertently spawned the fear of magic. From this hatred, he created the Empire and gathered the magic of the world's inhabitants for his own use. The raw magical energy drained from the captured magical creatures was collected in a vat, which Florian then dives into in the hopes of becoming a god; but instead becomes trapped inside a giant, leech- like monster, which is hailed as the Devourer by Marius. The Overlord battles and destroys both the Devourer and Florian. Depending on the player's actions during the game, one of three ending cutscenes plays: one for pure Domination, one for pure Destruction, and one for all other points on the scale. The Overlord either destroys the land or enslaves the populace, with the minions throwing huge parties. Either way, Gnarl reveals that even the Overlord's power might wane, finishing once again with \\"Evil always finds a way\\" before laughing maniacally off screen. Development Overlord II was announced on 13 August 2008 for the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It was announced at the same time as the Nintendo spin-offs Overlord: Dark Legend and Overlord: Minions. According to Lennart Sas, director and Overlord lead at Triumph Studios, the intention for Overlord II was \\"massively increases the scope of the original concept\\", already advertising promotional screenshots displaying the new features, such as the minions ability to ride mounted creatures. According to Sas, the reason behind the sequel was due to the \\"massive amount creative opportunity remaining in the concept\\" with \\"an improved game engine with high production values\\", mostly to increase the overall scope and \\"epic feel\\", such as the inclusion of large scale battles and the use of war machines and ships. Furthermore, the developers wanted to fine-tune aspects from the original like an on screen mini-map interference while retaining the basic gameplay element. As with the original Overlord, Sas did admit influence from similar games that allowed players take the role of a character with control over other units such as Pikmin while also mentioning much of the differentiating style being a different experience. There were changes to the gameplay in order to suit the game's personality such as the Neatherworld replacing the Dark Tower, being \\"much more alive with minion culture\\" and expanding the strategy elements being \\"important [to] expanded what the minions can do. Overlord is all about the minions. Rather than adding more base minion types (which would make controls more difficult and blur the lines between the minions), the four races are now stronger, more destructive and funnier than before.\\" The choice system was improved over the first due to some complaints the Overlord could do good deeds over evil ones. Instead this was replaced with the \\"Dominate or Destroy\\" structure instead. Writing It was confirmed that the protagonist was the implied son of the original Overlord as seen at the end of the first's expansion Raising Hell. With the continuation of the plot, Rhianna Pratchett was announced to return as the writer for the story, who was originally one of multiple writers before being the lead writer due to her \\"unique style and wit\\" being \\"a great match with the style and the story framework\\". According to Pratchett, the creative thought process behind the premise for Overlord was the appeal of villains in stories; \\"traditionally the bad guys always have the best of everything; the best lines, the best outfits and the best - and fluffiest - cats\\", feeling that \\"Overlord taps into what some games are lacking and that's pure, unadulterated, good fun. It produces this unrestrained, almost child-like grin in players when they see their Minions looting and pillaging, bringing back presents and dressing up in all manner of attire.\\" The workable humor of the series was said to stem from the gameplay itself that \\"the gameplay, environments, missions, minion antics, voice acting and script all worked well together\\", which would apparently not work if \\"against really straight gameplay or bland environments.\\" Pratchett commented that due to the \\"active, not passive\\" way of story telling video games had, characterisation is consequently done in a longer time frame of script, along with the \\"flexible\\" nature due to the integration of story and gameplay. As a result, the story of Overlord II (as well as Overlord: Minions and Overlord: Dark Legend) was written in order to \\"sit well in the Overlord world, but not be too reliant on players having played the previous games\\". In the case of Overlord II specifically, the story was to remain fresh by going beyond the previous satire of fantasy by including other themes, some of which being relevant to modern times, with the \\"Romanesque theme\\" being \\"a lot more of what you might call modern issues underlying the story and gameplay; environmental destruction, climate change, resource hoarding, propaganda and so on, but spun through Overlords twisted, heroic fantasy setting\\", as well as some characterisation being built off modern popular culture. For example, the character Florin according to Pratchett was to her \\"loosely based on that \\"Crying for Britney\\" guy.\\" Because of expanded themes and by now established setting, Pratchett felt that the sequel was \\"a stronger story for it and feels more cohesive than the first game.\\" Additionally, the story was said to have benefited due to the increased co-work with the Triumph Studios development team, with story and level design being developed consistently together. Release and downloadable content The demo for the Xbox 360 was released on 4 June 2009, before the PS3 and PC demo on 11 June 2009, ahead of the game's full release in North America on 23 June Europe on 26 June and Australia on 9 July. The demo featured the first segments of gameplay as the adult Overlord, and his first run in with Florian and the yeti in the Nordberg countryside, in line with the initial details of the game and its plot when it was first announced. Before its release, major game retailers like GameStop and Game offered collectible Minion figurines, one of each kind for those who pre-ordered the Overlord II or the Nintendo spin-offs. In addition to its pre- release promotion, Codemasters promoted Overlord through internet based marketing campaigns. The initial announcement of the game humorously focused on a portion of the game referred to as \\"clubbing baby seals\\" that was featured in the first screenshots and playable demo. This later became involved in an online mini-game entitled \\"Whack-A-Seal\\", a game in the same style whac-a-mole where a minion would club baby seals that popped up from holes in the ice. A live-action parody of television talk shows was also produced called \\"The Overlord Show\\", where a well dressed presenter wearing the Overlord's signature helmet named Max Goreman would show off minions to a studio audience and on stage guests and how they can help with their problems, such as incinerating a woman's ex-boyfriend, before the minions would then violently rush the audience, much to Goreman's delight. Before its release, Lennart Sas had already announced plans to develop downloadable content (DLC) with the intention of releasing it closer to the release date of the game, considering the content released for the last game to be \\"experimental\\" and \\"came a little too late after the release to appeal to all Overlords players\\". The first DLC, entitled \\"Battle Rock Nemesis\\", was released on 30 July 2009 over Xbox Live and PlayStation Network: this DLC replicated the single-player battle arena from the original Overlord that allowed players to engage with their minions in further combat with enemies defeated during the single-player story. Reception Upon release, Overlord II received on average a positive reception with an average critic average indicated as \\"generally favourable\\" at Metacritic (although the PS3 version was just under the score requirement), with most reviewers praising the multiple improvements over its predecessor while keeping core gameplay intact. 1UP.com complimented the game's premise, still kept enjoyable from the previous Overlord, that \\"commanding a legion of hilariously evil little critters to plunder and wreck everything in reach is the game's most basic appeal, and something that never really seems to get old.\\" This linked in with the game's humour, particularly the minions' personality and charm, with GameSpy complimenting \\"the maniacal Gremlin-esque voices and actions of the minions, making them at once both intimidating and strangely endearing\\", with the added feature of naming and resurrecting certain minions that resulted in \\"a surprising attachment.\\" X-Play echoed this view alone with utilising the hordes as \\"addictive, because you really do feel as if you're controlling your own private Gremlin horde.\\" On its gameplay, Official Xbox Magazine called it a \\"unique blend of action and strategy\\", helped with the added improvements over the first, including an in game mini- map and expanded options such as upgrades and choices. Eurogamer called the controls \\"simple yet flexible\\", but did find issues with an apparent \\"slightly wayward camera system\\". However, IGN considered the camera issues \\"painful\\" for being linked to control over actions at the same time. Between versions, the PC version is noted for having improved camera control over its console counterparts, with the option of shifting the camera via computer mouse described by GameSpot as \\"extremely handy\\" as opposed to the fixed console analog control. The checkpoint system was not as well received, with GamePro describing it as \\"unforgiving\\" at times. Game Informer felt a number of features, such as the multiplayer, were \\"tacked on\\"; this along with numerous technical issues led them to conclude that \\"Overlord II just feels like an unpolished retread of familiar ground.\\" Graphically, Overlord II was noted for being a noticeable upgrade from the last game, despite additional complaints of glitches; Team Xbox summarising that the graphics had \\"been improved, but there are still chunky spots\\". GameTrailers, noted that character animations during cutscenes were best described as \\"inert\\", but that the game was helped by \\"its dark sense of humour... coming out prominently in the game‚Äôs colourful voice acting\\". GameZone praised the soundtrack as \\"wonderfully cinematic and has that fantasy movie feel to it.\\" References External links *Planet Overlord at IGN Entertainment *Overlord II Virtual Booth at GameSpot 2009 video games Action role-playing video games Codemasters games Games for Windows certified games Overlord (video game series) PlayStation 3 games Video game sequels Video games developed in the Netherlands Video games set in the Middle Ages Windows games MacOS games Linux games Xbox 360 games ","title":"Overlord II"},{"id":"18856445","text":"Elvin Williamson Crane (October 20, 1853 - January 9, 1909) was an American lawyer and Democratic party politician from New Jersey.

He received his license as attorney in 1875 and as counsellor in 1882.Proceedings of the New Jersey Historical Society, Series 3, Volume 5 (1909), pp. 92-3. Crane married Emma J. Esch on July 9, 1879. They had two children, but both died young. In 1887 he was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly. He served as an assistant prosecutor for Essex County and then was appointed county prosecutor by Governor Robert Stockton Green. He was reappointed by Governor George Theodore Werts, serving until 1899. In 1898 Crane was the Democratic candidate for Governor of New Jersey. He faced the Republican candidate Foster MacGowan Voorhees, who was serving as acting governor after the appointment of John W. Griggs as United States Attorney General. Voorhees accused the Democrats of corruption, claiming that Crane was the tool of the party boss, United States Senator James Smith, Jr. Voorhees defeated Crane by a vote of 164,051 to 158,552.Biography of Foster MacGowan Voorhees, New Jersey State Library. Accessed August 13, 2008. After his term as Essex County Prosecutor ended in 1899, Crane pursued a private legal practice until 1907, when he was appointed county counsel.

The temple is also known by other names such as - Mathuranthaka Chaturvedi Mangalam, Vaikunda Varthanam, Thirumathurai, Thirumanthira Tirupathi, Karunagara Vilagam. Thirumalisai Alvar attained siddhi (enlightenment) in this sthalam (place). Also, Sri Ramanujar was instructed the Pancha Samskara Mantram at this place. History The temple was built during the Pallava era, and is estimated to be 1600 years old. The Moolavar (presiding deity) of the temple is Lord Rama, thus making this one of the oldest temples of lord Rama in South India. The temple has inscriptions indicating generous gifts from Chola king Parantaka I. The place was once famous during the rule of Cholas who ruled this place as Maduranthaga Chaturvedi Mangalam after the Chola ruler Madurantaga Uttama Chola (973 -85 CE). It is believed that Gandaraditya donated the village to the Vedics (Chaturvedi - one who knows all four vedas) of the place and hence it came to be known as Chaturvedi Mangalam. The Temple The presiding deity of the temple is Rama with his consort Sita and his brother Lakshmana. The images are made of stucco as is the case in some of the temples like Ulagalantha Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram. The Moolavar is in a standing position facing east and is around tall. There are different shrines around the sanctum and one of them is that of Sita who is worshipped as Janakavalli.Madhavan 2007, pp. 85-89 The Legend of Erikatha Ramar and Janakavalli Thayar of the temple This temple is situated near the Madhuranthakam lake shore. The temple also houses an image of Karunakaramurthi. During the period between 1795 and 1799 the Collector of Chingleput District was a British officer called Colonel Lionel Blaze. During his collectorship, Blaze had witnessed two breaches to the huge tank. The enormity of the problem can be appreciated only when we know of the massive size of the tank. Having an area of and a depth of , the breaching of the tank following torrential downpour was any official's nightmare. Wanting to take preemptive action in the year 1798 the Collector camped in Madurantakam. During his sojourn the Collector was exploring ways and means to undertake urgent repairs of the breaches if and when they happened. During the course of his inspections, he happened to see a large collection of granite and other stones in the precincts of the Rama temple. The Collector mentioned to his subordinates that these could be put to use in restoration of the bunds. Hearing this the temple priests submitted that the stones were meant for constructing a separate shrine for Janakavalli Thayar and since there was paucity of funds the construction could not commence. Hearing this the Collector is said to have remarked that where was the need for a separate shrine when more urgent work like repairing the bunds was crying for resources. He also asked the priests jestingly as to why the Lord was not able to save the tank each year? The priests replied saying that the Lord was always known to answer a sincere prayer from the heart.Pollet 1995, p. 85 The rains came and it poured. Within a few days the tank was full to the brim and a breach seemed imminent. That night a worried Collector camped near the tank hoping against hope that the bunds would hold. As he was inspecting, Colonel Blaze saw a miraculous sight. He saw two warriors bearing bow and quiver guarding the bunds. The British officer went on his knees and prayed, for he knew it was none other than Lord Rama and his divine brother Lakshmana. It was indeed strange that nobody else who was a part of the Collector's retinue saw the Lord. After a while the vision evanesced and the rain stopped. The grateful Collector undertook the building of the shrine for Janakavalli thayar and Lord Rama in the temple came to be known as the Erikatha Ramar (Rama who saved the tank (Eri)). The edict with the Collector's name citing him as a benefactor can be seen even today in the Madurantakam temple.  Ramanujar  thumb This is the place under the Magizha tree, where Sri Ramanujar was given \\"Pancha Samskaram\\" (initiation) by his teacher Peria Nambigal, following which Maduranthakam was given the name \\"Dvayam Vilindha Tirupathi\\". As per the legend, upon receiving Kanchi Varadarajar's divine order through Tirukachi Nambi, the Vaishnava saint Ramanuja set forth for Srirangam to become the disciple of Peria Nambigal. Peria Nambigal was on his way to Kanchipuram to install Ramanuja as the successor of Sri Aalanvandar. Ramanuja wanted to meet Periya Nambi and he started from Kanchipuram, while Periya Nambi started from Srirangam. They are believed to have met in Maduranthakam temple, in the lake precincts. In the month of Avani, on the Sukla Panchami, Peria Nambigal gave the Samasrayanam or Pancha Samskaram called Dvaya Mantropadesam (divine syllable). The festival is celebrated every year. Ramanuja is believed to have obtained Pancha Samskaram from Periya Nambi in the four pillared hall around the sanctum. This is the only place where Ramanujar can be seen as a Grihastha (family man). The major festival of the temple is the Rama Navami festival, which commemorates the birth of Rama. Ani Brahmostavam celebrated during the Tamil month of Aani (July - August) and Panchasamskaram festival to commemorate the sanctification of Ramanuja are other major festivals celebrated in the temple.  Transport  Maduranthakam is on the Trichy- Chennai highway (NH45) at a distance of 89 km from Chennai and 25 km from Chengalpattu. There are several buses travelling to Maduranthakam from Chennai. Maduranthakam also has its own railway station, with suburban trains going towards Melmaruvathur stopping here.

Cording Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv strain) viewed with fluorescent microscopy Cord factor, or trehalose dimycolate, is a glycolipid molecule found in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and similar species. It is the primary lipid found on the exterior of M. tuberculosis cells. Cord factor influences the arrangement of M. tuberculosis cells into long and slender formations, giving its name. Cord factor is virulent towards mammalian cells and critical for survival of M. tuberculosis in hosts, but not outside of hosts. Cord factor has been observed to influence immune responses, induce the formation of granulomas, and inhibit tumor growth. The antimycobacterial drug SQ109 is thought to inhibit TDM production levels and in this way disrupts its cell wall assembly.TAHLAN, K., R. WILSON, D. B. KASTRINSKY, K. ARORA, V. NAIR, E. FISCHER, S. W. BARNES, J. R. WALKER, D. ALLAND, C. E. BARRY a H. I. BOSHOFF. SQ109 Targets MmpL3, a Membrane Transporter of Trehalose Monomycolate Involved in Mycolic Acid Donation to the Cell Wall Core of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. 2012-03-16, vol. 56, issue 4, s. 1797-1809. DOI: 10.1128/AAC.05708-11. http://aac.asm.org/cgi/doi/10.1128/AAC.05708-11 Structure A cord factor molecule is composed of a trehalose sugar, a disaccharide, that is esterified to two mycolic acid residues. One of the two mycolic acid residues is attached to the sixth carbon of one monosaccharide, while the other mycolic acid residue is attached to the sixth carbon of the other monosaccharide. Therefore, cord factor is also named trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate. The carbon chain of the mycolic acid residues vary in length depending on the species of bacteria it is found in, but the general range is 20 to 80 carbon atoms. Cord factor's amphiphilic nature leads to varying structures when many cord factor molecules are in close proximity. On a hydrophobic surface, they spontaneously form a crystalline monolayer. This crystalline monolayer is extremely durable and firm; it is stronger than any other amphiphile found in biology. This monolayer also forms in oil-water, plastic-water, and air-water surfaces. In an aqueous environment free of hydrophobic surfaces, cord factor forms a micelle. Furthermore, cord factor interlocks with lipoarabinomannan (LAM), which is found on the surface of M. tuberculosis cells as well, to form an asymmetrical bilayer. These properties cause bacteria that produce cord factor to grow into long, intertwining filaments, giving them a rope- or cord-like appearance when stained and viewed through a microscope (hence the name). Evidence of virulence Scanning electron micrograph of Mycobacterium tuberculosis A large quantity of cord factor is found in virulent M. tuberculosis, but not in avirulent M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, M. tuberculosis loses its virulence if its ability to produce cord factor molecules is compromised. Consequently, when all lipids are removed from the exterior of M. tuberculosis cells, the survival of the bacteria is reduced within a host. When cord factor is added back to those cells, M. tuberculosis survives at a rate similar to that of its original state. Cord factor increases the virulence of tuberculosis in mice, but it has minimal effect on other infections. Biological function The function of cord factor is highly dependent on what environment it is located, and therefore its conformation. This is evident as cord factor is harmful when injected with an oil solution, but not when it is with a saline solution, even in very large amounts. Cord factor protects M. tuberculosis from the defenses of the host. Specifically, cord factor on the surface of M. tuberculosis cells prevents fusion between phagosomal vesicles containing the M. tuberculosis cells and the lysosomes that would destroy them. The individual components of cord factor, the trehalose sugars and mycolic acid residues, are not able to demonstrate this activity; the cord factor molecules must be fully intact. Esterase activity that targets cord factor results in the lysis of M. tuberculosis cells. However, the M. tuberculosis cells must still be alive to prevent this fusion; heat-killed cells with cord factor are unable to prevent being digested. This suggests an additional molecule from M. tuberculosis is required. Regardless, cord factor's ability to prevent fusion is related to an increased hydration force or through steric hindrance. Cord factor remains on the surface of M. tuberculosis cells until it associates with a lipid droplet, where it forms a monolayer. Then, as cord factor is in a monolayer configuration, it has a different function; it becomes fatal or harmful to the host organism. Macrophages can die when in contact with monolayers of cord factor, but not when cord factor is in other configurations. As the monolayer surface area of cord factor increases, so does its toxicity. The length of the carbon chain on cord factor has also shown to affect toxicity; a longer chain shows higher toxicity. Furthermore, fibrinogen has shown to adsorb to monolayers of cord factor and act as a cofactor for its biological effects. Host responses and cytokines Numerous responses that vary in effect result from cord factor's presence in host cells. After exposure to cord factor for 2 hours, 125 genes in the mouse genome are upregulated. After 24 hours, 503 genes are upregulated, and 162 genes are downregulated. The exact chemical mechanisms by which cord factor acts is not completely known. However, it is likely that the mycolic acids of cord factor must undergo a cyclopropyl modification to lead to a response from the host's immune system for initial infection. Furthermore, the ester linkages in cord factor are important for its toxic effects. There is evidence that cord factor is recognized by the Mincle receptor, which is found on macrophages. An activated Mincle receptor leads to a pathway that ultimately results in the production of several cytokines. These cytokines can lead to further cytokine production that promote inflammatory responses. Cord factor, through the Mincle receptor, also causes the recruitment of neutrophils, which lead to pro-inflammatory cytokines as well. However, there is also evidence that toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in conjunction with the protein MyD-88 is responsible for cytokine production rather than the Mincle receptor. Cord factor presence increases the production of the cytokines interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Œ≤), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNFŒ±), and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), which are all pro-inflammatory cytokines important for granuloma formation. IL-12 is particularly important in the defense against M. tuberculosis; without it, M. tuberculosis spreads unhampered. IL-12 triggers production of more cytokines through T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, while also leading to mature Th1 cells, and thus leading to immunity. Then, with IL-12 available, Th1 cells and NK cells produce interferon gamma (IFN-Œ≥) molecules and subsequently release them. The IFN-Œ≥ molecules in turn activate macrophages. When macrophages are activated by cord factor, they can arrange into granulomas around M. tuberculosis cells. Activated macrophages and neutrophils also cause an increase in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is important for angiogenesis, a step in granuloma formation. The granulomas can be formed either with or without T-cells, indicating that they can be foreign-body-type or hypersensitivity- type. This means cord factor can stimulate a response by acting as a foreign molecule or by causing harmful reactions from the immune system if the host is already immunized. Thus, cord factor can act as a nonspecific irritant or a T-cell dependent antigen. Granulomas enclose M. tuberculosis cells to halt the bacteria from spreading, but they also allow the bacteria to remain in the host. From there, the tissue can become damaged and the disease can transmit further with cord factor. Alternatively, the activated macrophages can kill the M. tuberculosis cells through reactive nitrogen intermediates to remove the infection. Besides inducing granuloma formation, activated macrophages that result from IL-12 and IFN-Œ≥ are able to limit tumor growth. Furthermore, cord factor's production of TNF-Œ±, also known as cachectin, is also able to induce cachexia, or loss of weight, within hosts. Cord factor also increases NADase activity in the host, and thus it lowers NAD; enzymes that require NAD decrease in activity accordingly. Cord factor is thus able to obstruct oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain in mitochondrial membranes. In mice, cord factor has shown to cause atrophy in the thymus through apoptosis; similarly in rabbits, atrophy of the thymus and spleen occurred. This atrophy occurs in conjunction with granuloma formation, and if granuloma formation is disturbed, so is the progression of atrophy. Scientific applications and uses Infection by M. tuberculosis remains a serious problem in the world and knowledge of cord factor can be useful in controlling this disease. For example, the glycoprotein known as lactoferrin is able to mitigate cytokine production and granuloma formation brought on by cord factor. However, cord factor can serve as a useful model for all pathogenic glycolipids and therefore it can provide insight for more than just itself as a virulence factor. Hydrophobic beads covered with cord factor are an effective tool for such research; they are able to reproduce an organism's response to cord factor from M. tuberculosis cells. Cord factor beads are easily created and applied to organisms for study, and then easily recovered. It is possible to form cord factor liposomes through water emulsion; these liposomes are nontoxic and can be used to maintain a steady supply of activated macrophages. Cord factor under proper control can potentially be useful in fighting cancer because IL-12 and IFN-Œ≥ are able to limit the growth of tumors.

G. Williams, commonly known as Camp Williams, also known as Army Garrison Camp Williams, is a National Guard training site operated by the Utah National Guard. It is located south of Bluffdale, west of Lehi, and north of Saratoga Springs and Cedar Fort, approximately south of Salt Lake City, straddling the border between Salt Lake County and Utah County in the western portion of the Traverse Mountains. Camp Williams is also home to the Non- Commissioned Officer's Basic Leader Course, which is taught to Active, National Guard, and Reserve components. Camp Williams land comprises about of flat area and of mountainous region. History The Utah Army National Guard traces its beginnings to the Utah Territorial Militia, known as the Nauvoo Legion. The Nauvoo Legion operated similarly to militias in other states and territories, including requiring adult men‚Äîbetween the ages of 18 and 45‚Äîto serve. The militia served as guardians of the Central Overland Route, and in the Utah War, Black Hawk War and Walker War. During this period the legion's various units had annual musters and training camps, with Lehi's unit often doing so near the site of today's Camp Williams. During a power struggle between the Federal government of the United States and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the militia was abolished in the Edmunds‚ÄìTucker Act of 1887. By March 1894 conflicts had settled down, and the Utah Territorial Legislature authorized Caleb Walton West, the Governor, to establish The National Guard of Utah. Twenty years later, in 1914 and 1915, US president Woodrow Wilson set aside 18,700 acres to provide permanent training grounds for the guard. This was the first official designation of land that would comprise Camp Williams. This original land makes up the western majority of the current site, which is rough and rugged, and lacked flat land for a cantonment area (headquarters and camp). So the State of Utah rented nearby flatter land, and then later purchased it to build a cantonment area. Permanent use of the area, including buildings, was not established at this time, due to World War I, and the site was just occasionally used until the 1920s. In both 1926 and 1927 the guard's annual encampment was held at the site, and in 1928 the camp was officially established for permanent use as Camp W.G. Williams. It was named after Brigadier General William Grey Williams in recognition of his war participation since the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and his work in establishing the site as a permanent training location. Machine Gun Fire Goats being used by the Utah Army National Guard to create a firebreak at Camp Williams. On 19 September 2010, live fire .50-caliber machine gun training at the camp sparked the \\"Machine Gun Fire\\" that resulted in over 3,500 acres burned and the loss of three homes in the city of Herriman to the north. Utah Data Center From 2011 to 2013, the National Security Agency (NSA) built a Community Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative Data Center at Camp Williams, the first in a series of data centers required for the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. The facility is built on where Camp Williams' former airfield was located on the west side of Utah Highway 68. It is rumored to be capable of storing 1 yottabyte of data by 2015, although this figure remains highly speculative. The facility will use 65 megawatts of electricity and will cost another $2 billion for hardware, software, and maintenance. This facility will greatly increase the NSA's ability to store and process millions of emails, IMs, SMS, and phone calls made daily by people around the world and in the United States.

Chinna Satyam was born in Kuchipudi, Andhra Pradesh. He was taught by Vedantam Lakshmi Narayana Sastry. He then refined his art by learning from Sri Tadepally Perrayya Sastry and later was trained by his elder brother Sri Vempati Pedda Satyam in expressions. As he learnt the nuances of this style of dance, he was successful in popularising the Kuchipudi dance form all over the world. He died of old age related problems at the age of 83 on 29 July 2012. Dance Chinna Satyam sublimated and systematised Kuchipudi, giving it a more classical basis. He refined the art form, bringing it closer to the standards of Natya Shastra and gave it a whole new perspective and introduced new elements, e.g. chari (leg movements) of Natya Shastra that are significantly different from the interpretations of other dance authorities, such as Padma Subrahmanyam.

The discovery of the Isenheim Altarpiece of Matthias Gr√ºnewald, which was temporarily exhibited at the Munich Pinacothek, was a revelation to him and he started his first attempts in middle-ages techniques: a well-performed drawing on a priming of chalk or plaster with a mixture of oil and yolk of an egg as paint. In 1920 he was appointed decorator at the theatre of D√ºsseldorf. After his marriage in 1925 to Liselotte Heckmann he lived for a year near Florence and then five years in Paris.

The Butterfly Hunter was completed in 2008, and submitted by the author to the Muslim Writers Awards in 2008, as an entry in the Novel category. The author was winner of the Muslim Writer of the Year Award in 2007, and the organisers of the Awards project described his 2008 submission as \\"one of the best\\" received. The Butterfly Hunter was a shortlisted nominee in the Novel category of the Muslim Writers Awards in 2008, along with four other works. However, the book was never submitted to the independent judging panel tasked with adjudicating competition entries. This omission of The Butterfly Hunter from the judging process has caused much public controversy. The author has claimed that the novel was censored by the Muslim Writers Awards due to its controversial content. However, the organisers of the Awards have strenuously denied the accusation, and have insisted that the matter is under investigation. The organisers have also stated that the omission is likely to have been an oversight, although this claim has met with some public cynicism. The narrative centres around two British protagonists, Jimmy and Jessica, who become involved in a terrorist plot and are recruited by extremists and become suicide bombers. The novel includes several controversial characters and plot- lines, including sexual abuse of children by a Mosque teacher and a bisexual Imam who habitually hires rent boys. Despite the controversy, and his belief that the organisers of the Muslim Writers Awards found his work \\"unpalatable\\", Dr. Max Malik has insisted that the book should not be regarded as \\"the second coming of The Satanic Verses, as he believes that the novel is \\"neither blasphemous nor disrespectful towards any particular group or individual.\\" References  Sources  * Official website for The Butterfly Hunter * Muslim author hits out at novel 'censorship', The Asian Today 21st- century British novels Upcoming books ","title":"The Butterfly Hunter"},{"id":"18856784","text":"Nelson Rapids is a very prominent feature located on the North Seal River just west of Egenolf Lake, Manitoba, which occur in a narrow section where the river is approximately 75 meters wide.

On July 1, 2009, the Koffler was incorporated as an independent not-for-profit charitable organization. The Koffler was home to the Jewish Book Fair (1977-2011), the Toronto Jewish Literary Festival (2012-2014) and the Koffler Chamber Orchestra (2005-2014). In 2008, the Koffler Centre of the Arts was rebranded and restructured, with a multidisciplinary program department that ran complementary to the Koffler Gallery. Unlike the Gallery, with its mandate to exhibit, interpret, and document works in the visual arts, focusing on contemporary Canadian art and programming of interest to the Jewish community, the multidisciplinary programs focused more specifically on Jewish arts and culture from Canada and internationally. The Koffler Gallery moved its programming off-site in 2009 when the original Koffler Gallery was demolished along with the BJCC. Koffler multidisciplinary programs were also programmed off-site around the GTA, with events located downtown, mid-town and the north GTA (Vaughan/Thornhill). In 2013, after five years programming off-site, the Koffler Centre of the Arts opened its administrative offices and a new Koffler Gallery at Artscape Youngplace in downtown Toronto. The Artscape Youngplace facilities showcase Koffler Gallery exhibitions, public programs, expanded school and education programs, as well as programs in partnership with Artscape Youngplace tenants and other neighbourhood organizations. Koffler multidisciplinary programs (concerts, literary events, artist residencies, theatre programs, lectures/talks and more) now take place at Artscape Youngplace, as well as various locations across the GTA. Starting in summer 2014, the Koffler no longer offers studio classes in visual art and ceramics at the Prosserman JCC on Sherman Campus (at Bathurst and Sheppard). Classes at that location are now offered under the management of the Prosserman JCC. Leadership and Funding From 2001 to 2014, Tiana Koffler Boyman was the Board Chair. From 2006 to 2013, Lori Starr, former Senior Vice President and Museum Director, Skirball Cultural Center (2001‚Äì2006) and former Director of Public Affairs and Communications, the J. Paul Getty Museum and J. Paul Getty Trust, Los Angeles (1986‚Äì2001), was the Executive Director. In February 2013, Starr left the Koffler for the position of Executive Director of the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco. From 2014 to 2019, Cathy Jonasson was the Koffler Centre of the Arts' Executive Director. Karen Tisch was appointed Executive Director in March 2019. The Koffler Centre of the Arts is supported and funded by the Koffler Family Foundation as well as its patrons, members, donors and corporate sponsors. The Centre receives annual support from the Ontario Arts Council through the Community and Multidisciplinary Arts Organizations Program, and received funding in 2013 for renovations to its new space at Artscape Youngplace through the Ontario Trillium Foundation. CIBC Wood Gundy is the Koffler's Cultural Season Sponsor (2009‚Äìpresent). The Koffler Gallery is a public gallery supported by the City of Toronto through the Toronto Arts Council, the Ontario Arts Council and the Canada Council for the Arts. Fundraising to support the Koffler's diverse programs is achieved through several charitable events, philanthropic donations to its exhibitions and programs, and galas. Two fundraisers in 2009, ARTFUL DISH and The Wrecking Ball, were catalysts to support expansion of programs and reach new audience members and patrons. In 2010, the ballet gala Stars of the 21st Century was the Koffler's major fundraiser. In 2012, the Koffler partnered with Luminato, Toronto's Festival of Arts and Creativity, to present the opening night of Batsheva Dance Company's North American premiere performance of Sadeh21. Funds raised from the evening supported the Koffler Centre of the Arts and its programs. The evening included a pre-performance dinner at a private residence for Koffler patrons, the contemporary dance performance of Sadeh21 at the MacMillan Theatre, University of Toronto, and a post-event celebration at the Gardiner Museum. The evening also honoured Senator Linda Frum and Howard Sokolowski for their philanthropic support of the arts. In 2013, the Koffler's major fundraiser was Koffler Rocks! - a benefit evening featuring music performances by Randy Bachman, The Sadies, and Melanie Fiona. The event took place at Artscape Wychwood Barns on May 2, 2013. On May 15, 2014, the Koffler revived its ARTFUL DISH fundraiser, featuring intimate dinners in private homes with cultural luminaries and well-known chefs. Luminaries included Ian Brown, Johanna Schneller, Adad Hannah, Barbara Astman, Deepa Mehta, Anne Michaels, Bernice Eisenstein, Colin Mochrie, Debra McGrath, Louise Pitre, Veronica Tennant. In 2015, the Koffler's major fundraiser was Art Priv√©: 3 Nights in June, three intimate evenings in exclusive private settings featuring modern and contemporary art collections. Activities and Facilities thumb The Koffler Gallery's inaugural exhibition 'We're in the Library' at Artscape Youngplace, November 2013 The Koffler presents exhibitions of contemporary Canadian and international art with the Koffler Gallery, and is home to the Vine Awards for Canadian Jewish Literature (formerly known as the Canadian Jewish Book Awards). It presents year-round literary events, concerts, education programs, film screenings, theatre programs, and discussions on contemporary art and culture. Rooted in the Jewish community of Toronto, the Koffler specializes in an interdisciplinary mix of programs to bring artists and the community together. In 2009, the Koffler Centre of the Arts was incorporated for charitable status in Canada. Koffler Gallery The Koffler Gallery was established in 1980 and initially developed a successful range of exhibitions on contemporary crafts. It shifted its mandate in 1994 to focus on contemporary Canadian art. From 1980 to 2009, the Gallery was located in its own dedicated space at the Bathurst Jewish Community Centre. In 2009, the Gallery moved its programming off-site when the Bathurst Jewish Community Centre was demolished. From 2009 to 2013, the Gallery exhibited its exhibitions and site-specific installations in various locations across the Greater Toronto area, including Honest Ed's, an abandoned house, the Jack Layton Ferry Docks, city sidewalks, parking lots, construction hoarding, and other rented or borrowed spaces. In November 2013, the Gallery opened its new downtown space at Artscape Youngplace.

Reena Katz controversy In May 2009 The Koffler Centre of the Arts announced it was disassociating itself from artist Reena Katz as a result of her support for Israel Apartheid Week, and a petition that she signed \\"condemning Zionism to the dustbin of history.\\" The Koffler Centre stated that such activities undermine the existence of Israel as a Jewish state.\\"\\", An Open Letter from Jewish Youth in Canada, 5 January 2009 As stated on its website, undated documents say that the existence of Israel as a Jewish state is a core value of The Koffler. These documents did not exist at the time the controversy began. The website also stated that \\"[w]hile we will support artists with diverse views about Israel, we will not endorse anyone who calls for the demise of Israel as a Jewish state.\\" Katz \\"categorically rejects\\" this interpretation of her position.Murray Whyte,\\"Will politics wreck Wrecking Ball?\\", Toronto Star, 14 June 2009 The Koffler Centre of the Arts has kept its contractual financial obligations to the project, each hand as they are called, which was planned to be associated with Toronto's Luminato festival. Katz' show was to be a non-political celebration of Jewish history in Kensington Market, which the Toronto Star described as \\"a gentle exploration of the layers of multi-ethnic immigrant history in Kensington Market, played out on the market's streets in performance and, in one notably warm-fuzzy intervention, a game of mah jongg between members of a Jewish seniors' centre and a class of Grade 8 students at a nearby school.\\" The Centre's objection was not to the planned installation itself, which they had heartily approved of every step of the way, but to Katz' anti-Zionist views and activism (which was seen as undermining Israel as a Jewish state), prompting Koffler's action to be described as blacklisting by critics.Stuart Laidlaw, \\"Has Jewish group forgotten its roots? Critics say Canadian Jewish Congress has clout in top circles, but not in community\\", Toronto Star, 23 May 2009 The Centre's response was \\"Just as every individual has a right to freedom of expression, any organization is free to choose with whom it partners.\\"\\"\\", Lori Starr, Letter to the Editor, \\"Decision not based on beliefs\\", Toronto Star, 16 May 2009 Katz and independent curator Kim Simon, hired by the Koffler Center to curate the project, had been working on it for well over a year, and claim that from the beginning they had made Katz's critical activism concerning Israel clear to the Centre's own curator, Mona Filip (their link to the Centre) who in turn must have told executive director Starr about it. Katz herself describes the effect of having only a single one-hour meeting with Starr on May 8, who then immediately issued the Koffler's press statement nationally, as a \\"stonewalling of internal dissent and debate... At no point along the way was I asked to represent myself, my ideas, or the mandates of the groups I belong to, despite amicable, almost daily contacts with Filip for many months.\\"\\"\\", Reena Katz, From Reena Katz, Artist, \\"Two Jewish cultural workers, 30,000 opinions: A public statement from artist Reena Katz and curator Kim Simon\\", Press Release, 10 May 2009 As a result of the Centre's actions, 4 of the 34 artists pulled out of Koffler's summer art party and fundraiser The Wrecking Ball as a protest. One artist, Gwen MacGregor, stated \\"It really speaks to fundamental issues about freedom of expression and freedom of association. It's the thin edge of the wedge, in terms of censorship, and that's a slippery slope.\\" Another artist, Yvonne Singer, the only professional artist on the Koffler Board and an associate professor at York University, where she was in charge of the graduate program in visual art, resigned from the Board. She said, concerning a meeting of the Board's Arts Advisory Committee on May 1 where Starr had raised the issues, \\"Several of us objected. The exhibition had nothing to do with [Katz's] political views, and in any case, she had a right to them as a citizen.\\" Singer again objected at the May 4 meeting of the full Board, but a majority agreed with Starr. In addition dozens of faculty from OCAD and York Universities signed a letter to the Koffler Centre stating that the latter's \\"decision is a highly political act that serves to discredit Katz, her work and the validity of the political views and opinions she may hold as a Jew, an artist, and a social citizen.\\" In its FAQ (undated and not posted until well after the controversy began), the Koffler Centre of the Arts denies censorship since it did not cancel the exhibition and continued to fund it. They claim that the decision as to whether the exhibition continues remains in the hands of the artist and curator. This point of view was not accepted by journalists such as Murray Whyte, visual arts reporter at the Toronto Star, or Susan G.

The school, a part of Ralston Public Schools, opened in 1954, as a building for grades 7‚Äì12, located at 82nd and Lakeview Drive. It relocated to its current address on 8969 Park Drive in 1969. Prior to 1954, Ralston students went to Omaha South High School as Ralston Schools only had grades K-8. The former high school building was converted to the middle school. Ralston High School's colors are red, white and columbian blue. In 2006, Ralston High School's enrollment jumped from 850 to 1090 students. It is becoming a more diverse school. Extracurricular activities Athletics The athletic teams are known as the Ralston Rams. Ralston participates in Nebraska's second-largest class. The school's baseball teams have experienced success, with 18 appearances in the state tournament, their most recent appearance in 2006. The Rams have been in the finals seven times, and captured the state title seven times, holding the second most state titles in baseball, behind Creighton Prep's eight. The football team has been successful as well since Head Coach Tyler Zahn took over. They made an appearance in the State Finals in 2002, where they beat their rival Gross to make it to Memorial Stadium in Lincoln. Ralston played tough but lost to McCook. The closest the Rams have come to the finals again was in 2011, when the Rams beat Scottsbluff in Scottsbluff and came home to face the top seed Gretna, where they lost. Ralston basketball has also had some fantastic success lately, winning the State Title in 2008 against Beatrice. From that team, two top athletes went on to play Division 1 Basketball at Colorado State. Brothers Greg and Dwight Smith led the team that year, and they were both nominated as All-State in 2008. Ralston Basketball is one of the top programs in the last decade behind Beatrice and Gretna, with a winning percentage of 64.3% and a win total of 146 in the last 10 years. The Rams' student section known as the \\"Rowdies\\" attends every major sporting event. Arts The Ralston Performing Arts Centre is located inside Ralston High School. This stage is used once a year in the summer by the Ralston Community Theatre, and is used throughout the school year by Ralston Drama students. The theatre, along with the entire school, was recently renovated and now seats 600+ people. The new theatre's first show was Les Mis√©rables, in May 2005. The Ralston Fine Arts Department has had success in recent years. The band has almost tripled in size, received numerous awards including best drumline, best drum major, and has had continuous success at competitions, receiving all \\"superior\\" and \\"excellent\\" ratings. Ralston High School has two competing show choirs: Runway and Rush. Rush has had successful competition seasons, often placing in the top of their division and competing in finals. In recent years Rush has been named grand champion at Millard West Singsation and at Bishop Heelan High School show choir invitational.

P. macrocephalus has cream-green coloured ovoid flower heads.

The company is also involved in sporting business, owning the Djarum Badminton Club and sponsored the Indonesian top football league from 2005 to 2011. It also has non- cigarette business lines, such as in technology, banking, and beverage. History In 1951, Oei Wie Gwan, an ethnic Chinese businessman, bought a nearly defunct cigarette company in Kudus, Central Java known as NV Murup. The brand was called Djarum Gramofon which means 'gramophone needle' he shortened it into Djarum (current spelling: jarum) which only means needle. The company's first brand was 'Djarum'. The company was nearly extinct when in 1963 a huge fire destroyed the company's factory which was followed by the death of Oei Wie Gwan. Nevertheless, the new owners, Oei Wie Gwan's children Budi and Bambang Hartono, took the opportunity to rebuild the company. The products are hand-rolled or machine-rolled kretek, both of which are popular and produced in large quantities. The classic hand-rolled kretek continues to be made by Djarum using older methods of manual rolling by laborers. Machine- rolled kretek, introduced in early 1970, are manufactured in a fully automated process.http://www.djarum.co.id/index.php/en/world_of_djarum/page/6 Djarum Super was launched in 1981, followed by introduction of Djarum Special in 1983.http://www.djarum.com/brands/international-brands/djarum-special/ While the domestic market for kretek was large, in 1972 the company began exporting hand-rolled kretek to tobacco retailers around the world.Kretek, Hanusz, Mark. 2003.

Garcia Rivera made history when in 1937 he became the first Puerto Rican to be elected to public office in the continental United States. In 1956, he also became the first Puerto Rican to be nominated as the Republican candidate for Justice of the City Court. Early years Garcia Rivera was born in the city of Mayag√ºez, located in the western region of Puerto Rico, to a prosperous family who owned a coffee plantation. There he received his primary and secondary education. He attended the Escuela Central Grammar (Junior High School), where he was valedictorian of his graduating class in 1921, and in 1925 was the Class President of the graduating class from Mayag√ºez High School. In 1917, during his school years, the United States became involved in World War I and the U.S. Congress approved the Jones-Shafroth Act, which gave Puerto Ricans a United States citizenship with limitations. Puerto Ricans became eligible for the military draft, plus they were now permitted to hold public office in the mainland United States, however Puerto Ricans in the island were not allowed to vote for the president nor were they allowed to have representatives in the US legislature, other than the Resident Commissioner, who did not have the right to vote in any of the measures presented before Congress. Labor activist Garcia Rivera visited New York City as soon as he finished high school and returned home. In 1926, he moved to Manhattan and rented an apartment on West 110th Street in a barrio made up mostly of Puerto Ricans known as Spanish Harlem. Garcia Rivera applied for a position in the City Hall Postal Office and proceeded to take the Postal Clerk's examination. In the meantime he held a part-time job at the Boerum and Pease Binder factory in Brooklyn.The Oscar Garcia Rivera Papers He was a witness of the July 1926, \\"Harlem Riots\\" against the Puerto Rican. As the economic situation in the United States worsened in a prelude to the Great Depression, many Puerto Ricans in the mainland found themselves competing with other groups for the positions of unskilled labor such as dishwashers, maintenance and laundry workers. This led to the riots between unemployed Jews and Puerto Ricans.\\"Leonard Covello and the Making of Benjamin Franklin High School\\"; By Michael C. Johanek, John L. Puckett; Page 66; Published 2007 Temple University Press; With a score of 98.4% on his Postal Clerk examinations, Garcia Rivera was appointed to the City Hall Post Office. Garc√≠a Rivera became active in the Postal Clerks' Union of America. He encouraged other Puerto Rican and Hispanic employees to participate in the union and to seek higher wages and better working conditions. Prominent labor leaders in the country took notice, thereby earning their respect and support. He used the money which he earned as a postal worker to pay for his tuition at St. John's University School of Law. In 1930, Garcia Rivera earned his law degree and married Elo√≠sa Rivera with whom he had a son, Oscar Garc√≠a Rivera Jr. In April 1935, he was admitted to the Bar association and established a law practice in his apartment where he worked closely and provided significant support to the working class and the Puerto Rican community at times providing pro-bono representation and legal advice. He later relocated his practice to 113th Street and Fifth Avenue. Political career One of the consequences of the Great Depression was the employment opportunities were scarce across all of the United States. Unemployment was especially high in areas such as Spanish Harlem and gave rise to a high crime rate. Adding to the misery was the fact that schools were overcrowded and housing was severely limited, plus discrimination by neighbors, government officials and police brutality was rampant. Another factor which made it difficult for the Puerto Ricans living in New York City was the language barrier. Their inability to communicate and be understood made it difficult for them to be properly represented before the authorities. In 1937, Garcia Rivera, who had joined the Republican Party, launched his candidacy for the New York State Assembly as East Harlem's representative with the support of Independent Democrats, leftists, fusionists, labor unions, and the American Labor Party. Among those who supported his nomination were: New York City's Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, Manhattan D.A. Thomas E. Dewey, and Union leaders like Michael J. Quill, TWU, George Meaney, AFL/CIO, Alex Rose and Benjamin MacLauren. He was elected to the Assembly (New York Co., 17th D.), thus becoming the first Puerto Rican in history to be elected to public office in the United States, and took his seat in the 161st New York State Legislature in 1938. In June 1938, he was refused a renomination by the Republicans,REPUBLICANS DROP AN ASSEMBLYMAN in the New York Times on June 30, 1938 (subscription required) but was re-elected in November 1938 on the American Labor ticket only. He sat in the 162nd New York State Legislature in 1939 and 1940. During his term in office, he emphasized issues of child labor, protective laws for workers, labor services, and anti- discrimination legislation. Work as an Assemblyman On February 3, 1939, the Assembly passed his \\"Unemployment Insurance Bill\\" which paved the way for the passage of bills establishing minimum hours and wages for working people, the creation of a Wage Board within the Labor Department, and the right of employees to organize and negotiate grievances. The following are the provisions of Garcia Rivera's \\"Unemployment Insurance Bill\\": 1\\\\. Make all employers, instead of those employing four or more persons, liable for contributions to the unemployment insurance fund. 2\\\\. Provide for payment of full 16 weeks' insurance benefits to claimants qualified by 18 weeks employment in any one year. 3\\\\. Reduce the necessary unemployment period, after application for benefits, from five to two weeks. 4\\\\. Make benefits available to anyone earning less than $5.a week instead of $2 a week. Garcia Rivera also proposed labor related bills which provided for: * Penalties for violators of the State's Labor Relations Act; * Establishing minimum wages and minimum hours for men, women and children; * Establishing a division of hours and wages (within the Labor Department) and * The creation of a Wage Board. * Bill calling for two days rest in seven for certain (Government) employees was also submitted by Assemblyman Oscar Garcia Rivera on January 17, 1939. Other labor related bills submitted by Garcia Rivera provided for: * Certificates of Incorporation of Labor Organizations * The right of employees to organize and negotiate on grievances, and * An appropriation to The State Labor Department for its responsibilities of certifying private employment agencies In 1940, he was a delegate to the National Republican Convention in Philadelphia. Later years In 1956, Garcia Rivera became the first Puerto Rican to be nominated as the Republican candidate for Justice of the City Court. Garcia Rivera was an active member of the legal community and served as President and Board Member of the Puerto Rican Bar Association of New York.

This statement appears to be a fabrication of the truth, as there is no record of Hardy as a part of the F.B.I. or having a 6‚Äì8 months stint in ECW. In early 2000, he began wrestling for the promotion New Millennium Wrestling where he was an instrumental part of bringing independent wrestling back to the Rochester, NY area. He teamed up with Mike \\"Rose\\" Rosario, a student Hardy had trained at \\"Bad Boy's House of Pain. They became known as the tag team Vain and Insane and won the first tournament to become the first NMW Tag Team Champions. Vain and Insane were stripped of their tag team championships and in the next tournament Killer Kowalski, Jr single handedly became the only one man tag team champion. After the breakup Hardy defeated Jason Atlas to become the NMW Heavyweight Champion (which Hardy still defends today).He has defended the title against some of the top wrestlers on the independent circuit including his former tag team partner Duane Gill and Killer Kowalski, Jr., the kayfabe son of Killer Kowalski, whom he defeated in a no-holds-barred street fight. He later left NMW after a dispute, forfeiting the Heavyweight Championship. Months later he wrestled alongside Kowalski Jr. in New York Championship Wrestling (NYCW), based out of Syracuse, NY. After promoter Zane Allen folded NYCW, Hardy wrestled with Kowalski Jr a few times in Toronto and then relocated to Florida where remained fairly inactive, until returning to Rochester, on March 14, 2009 Hardy returned to Rochester, defeating Eric Everlast for Pier 6 Wrestling. Hardy also wrestled in NEW Niagara on April 4, 2009. On that night, Hardy and his son were defeated by the Emanon Boyz. Recently Hardy was listed #494 in the Pro Wrestling Illustrated 500. He thanked wrestling journalist Scotty Bender for rejuvenating his career. On the August 6, 2011 edition of Rochester, NY based Pier 6 Wrestling \\"Shakedown TV\\", Barry was defeated by \\"The Righteous One\\" JC Money by disqualification.

Biography He was born in Vercelli to Count Carlo Emanuele Arborio Mella, who for many years was mayor of Vercelli, and Vittoria Gattinara, daughter of Ludovico count of Zubiena. He was educated first at home. From 1820 to 1827 he attended the Collegio-Convitto del Carmine in Turin, a Jesuit-run boarding school then popular among the Piedmontese aristocracy, where he displayed a particular talent for mathematical subjects.. In 1834 he married Adele Clotilde Olgiati, daughter of Giuseppe Alessandro Olgiati. She died five years later in 1839, having given birth to three children: Carlo Alessandro, Maria Vittoria and Federico. The last of these became an architect and archaeologist, and worked on various projects with his father. Mella‚Äôs interest in Gothic architecture took him to Switzerland, France and Germany; there were further trips to Monaco, Constantinople, Venice, Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Athens and Vienna. He was responsible for the nineteenth-century restoration of the Duomo of Casale Monferrato; the works began in 1857 and were completed in 1861. Subsequently he worked on restorations at Rosignano Monferrato, Mirabello, Villanova Monferrato and of the church of Sant‚ÄôIlario in Casale. Mella‚Äôs publications included treatises on geometry and architecture and monographs on medieval monuments. His obituary in the Salesian Bulletin of February 1884 points to two works of particular interest: Elementi di architettura archi-acuta o gotica (‚ÄòElements of Ogival or Gothic Architecture‚Äô; 1857) and Elementi di architettura romano-bizantina, detta lombarda (‚ÄòElements of the Romano- Byzantine Architecture called Lombard‚Äô, 1885).

Seacocks are often a Kingston valve. Seacocks are left open or are closed depending on the situation. Seacocks feeding into or out of a closed system, like the engine cooling system, are almost always left open. Seacocks connected to something open, such as a sink drain, might be opened up in port but closed when at sea. The reason for this is that when the boat is level, the drain or other opening will always be above the waterline, and so water will only flow out. At sea, when the boat rolls in the waves, the opening may sometimes be below the waterline. If the seacock is open, water may flood the boat, causing it to sink. Sea valve at lower right Along the same lines, some seacocks on warships are designed to flood the ship when opened. Typically, this is done to magazines to prevent detonation of the ammunition in the event of fire, such as the case with , or to maintain trim due to battle damage (counterflooding).

In Japanese it is called the mizugumo. The Japanese water spider is almost exactly like its European cousin. The only distinction between the two is that the Japanese water spider has larger genitalia. Like its cousin, the Japanese water spider lives under water by constructing diving bells, underwater spheres which contain oxygen, which they live in. The creation of a subspecies In 2002 Hirotsugu Ono proposed that the Japanese water spider be hitherto known as a subspecies of the water spider. Ono had collected Japanese specimens of the water spider and found that species in Europe and Japan differed: > An infraspection classification is herewith proposed mainly on the basis of > a slight difference in the shape of male palp recognized between specimens > from Europe and Japan.ONO, H. \\"New and Remarkable Spiders of the Families > Liphistiidae, Argyronetidae, Pisauridae, Theridiidae and Araneidae > (Arachnida) from Japan.\\" Bull Natl Sci Mus Ser A 28.1 (2002): 51-60. Ono proposed the new subspecies because the Japanese male's palp, or genitalia, is longer than the European male's palp. The Japanese female's genitalia are also larger than the European female's genitalia. Habitats in Japan According to T. Matsumoto the Japanese water spider has been ‚Äúfound in ‚Ä¶the Mizoro Pond in Kyoto Prefecture, Kiritappu, [the] Kusiro swamp, Teshio, [the] Sarobetu swamp in [the] Hokkaido prefecture, Syarki village in Aomori prefecture, [and the] Oita prefecture.MASUMOTO, T., et al. \\"Water Conditions of the Habitat of the Water Spider Argyroneta Aquatica (Araneae: Argyronetidae) in Mizoro Pond.\\" ACTA ARACHNOLOGICA 47 (1998): 121-4.‚Äù All of these habitats are ‚Äúisolated geographically.‚Äù Behavior Males and females are different in many ways. Males rove frequently, searching for prey and for mates. Females, however, spend the majority of their lives inside their diving bells; they ambush their prey.

Mating The Japanese water spider is unusual in that males are almost always larger than females. This is called sexual size dimorphism (SSD). When water spiders mate the male begins by approaching the female's diving bell. He then chases her out of the diving bell and they begin ‚Äúcourtship swimming.‚Äù They then return to the female's diving bell to mate. Silk and construction The Japanese water spider spins four main kinds of silk: (1) silk used for the diving bell, (2) silk to anchor the diving bell to water plants, (3) silk for ‚Äúwalking‚Äù so as to get prey and mate, and (4) silk for the egg-cocoon.De Bakker, D., et al. \\"Description of the Structure of Different Silk Threads Produced by the Water Spider Argyroneta Aquatica (Clerck, 1757)(Araneae: Cybaeidae).\\" Belgian Journal of Zoology 136.2 (2006): 137-43. The diving bell silk is ‚Äúused for breathing,‚Äù that is it serves to oxygenate the diving bell.Schutz D, Taborsky M, Drapela T. 2007. Air bells of water spiders are an extended phenotype modified in response to gas composition. J. Exp. Zool. 307A:549‚Äì555. Females produce larger diving bells than males. Males build their diving bells less carefully than females do.Crome, W. ‚ÄúDie respirations- und Circulationsorgane der Argyroneta aquatic‚Äù Cl. (Araneae). Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift der Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Jahrgang II, Mathematisch- naturwissenschaftliche Reihe. ¬æ (1952): 53-83. Males also frequently make more walking threads than females. Females weave the egg-cocoon into the top of the diving bell. The egg-cocoon is made up of two parts. The outer is the cocoon- sac and the inner part is the egg sack. Other Argyronetidae vs. Cybinidae There has been some debate amongst arachnologists as to whether the water spider (A. a. aquatica) belongs to the family Cybinidae or Argyronetidae. In this article the Japanese water spider (A. a. japonica) is listed as being in the family Argyronetidae, because the subspecies authority, Hirotsugu Ono, chose to place it in this family. The Anime Short Film In 2006 Hayao Miyazaki produced a short film titled \\"Mizugumo Monmon\\". The film's main character is a Japanese Water Spider, named Monmon, who falls in love with a water skimmer. The water skimmer is at first frightened of him, but eventually she falls in love with him. The film is only shown in Miyazaki's Ghibli Museum. The target audience for the film is children.Solomon, Charles. ‚ÄúMr. Miyazaki‚Äôs World of Wonder.‚Äù Animation Magazine. 21 no4 April 2007: 9.

It is very important in the metabolism of red blood cells (erythrocytes). 6PDG deficiency affects less than 1% of the population, and studies suggest that there may be race variant involved in many of the reported cases. Although it is similar, 6PDG deficiency is not linked to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as they are located on different chromosomes. However, a few people have had both of these metabolic diseases. Signs and symptoms 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase deficiency can be asymptomatic in many patients who are carriers. Female carriers have been found to more frequently experience symptoms. Enzyme activity was shown to be reduced by 35‚Äì65% depending on the severity of the deficiency. Abnormal red blood cell breakdown (hemolysis) in 6PGD deficiency can be symptomatic in a number of ways, including the following: * Neonatal jaundice, ** Possibility of leading to kernicterus due to a hyperbilirubinemia * Hemolytic crises in response to: ** Illness and infections ** Certain drugs ** Certain foods ** Certain chemicals * In extreme cases, kidney failure Genetics 6PGD deficiency is a recessive hereditary disorder located on the P arm of chromosome 1. It is an autosomal disease, not associated with the sex chromosomes and can affect both sexes. The lack of synthesis of a specific protein on chromosome 1 has reduced a subject suffering from 6PGD deficiency from producing adequate amounts of the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase enzyme. Transfer of the disease can be passed from a parent, even when the parent is asymptomatic. Pathophysiology Pentose phosphate pathway with a breakdown in the conversion of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase to ribulose-5-phosphate due to a deficiency of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase enzyme Reaction mechanism 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (see image). 6PGD catalyzes the reaction of 6-phosphogluconate to an unstable form of 3-keto-6-phosphogluconate, and yields a co-enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as a byproduct. NADPH supplies reducing power to cells. The reaction is the second NADPH releasing reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway, the first being catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. 3-keto-6-phosphogluconate then rapidly (in an irreversible reaction) decarboxylates to CO2 and ribulose-5-phosphate, which is the precursor to many vital metabolic processes. Importance of NADPH The NADPH pathway (both 6PGD and G6PD reactions) is the only source of reductant to reduce glutathione in red blood cells. The role of erythrocytes as oxygen carriers puts them at risk of being damaged by oxidizing free radicals. The reduction of glutathione acts as an antioxidant and prevents damage from reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress People suffering from 6PGD or G6PD deficiency (or both) are at risk of hemolytic anemia in states of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can result from infection and from chemical exposure to medication and certain foods. Broad beans, e.g., fava beans, contain high levels of vicine, divicine, convicine and isouramil, all of which are oxidants. When all remaining reduced glutathione is consumed, enzymes and other proteins, such as hemoglobin are subsequently damaged by the free radicals, leading to electrolyte imbalance, cross-bonding and protein deposition in the red cell membranes. Damaged red cells are phagocytosed and sequestered (taken out of circulation) in the spleen. The hemoglobin is metabolized to bilirubin (causing jaundice). The red blood cells rarely disintegrate in the circulation, so hemoglobin is rarely excreted directly by the kidney, but this can occur in severe cases, causing acute kidney injury. Diagnosis Treatment Prevention The most important measure taken for treatment of 6-phosphoglucanate dehydrogenase is prevention. Avoidance of chemical exposures to drugs and foods that have the potential to cause hemolysis. Although some foods and supplements have antioxidant properties, their use does not decrease the severity of G6PD deficiency. Diagnosis is difficult during haemolytic episodes since reticulocytes have increased levels of enzymes and may produce erroneously normal results. Testing can be useful after a steady state is reached (about six weeks after the most recent episode of haemolysis), including a G6PD assay to confirm a diagnosis and G6PD spectrophotometry to detect the level of activity. Vaccinations against some common pathogens (e.g. hepatitis A and hepatitis B) may prevent infection- induced attacks. Blood transfusion In the acute phase of hemolysis, blood transfusions might be necessary, or even dialysis in acute kidney injury. Blood transfusion is an important symptomatic measure, as the transfused red cells are generally not 6PGD deficient and will live a normal lifespan in the recipient's circulation.

In April 1945, on the orders of General Charles de Gaulle, General Garbay took the 1st Free French Division to the Alpes-Maritimes, where, after 3 days of fierce fighting, they cleared the fortified massif of the Authion, the key to the enemy's defensive system in the Southern Alps. After the end of the war, Garbay's military career continued in Madagascar, Indochina, Tunisia and Senegal, and he achieved the rank of lieutenant general. In 1955 he became Assistant Chief of Staff of the French Army and, in 1958, he was promoted to the rank of Army General and was appointed military governor of Paris. In 1959, he was appointed as Inspector of Overseas Forces. On 1 April 1961, at his request, he relinquished control of the active army and he was placed in reserve.

Written in the form of a novel, the book deals with the life and love of Voltaire and his mistress, scientist √âmilie du Ch√¢telet. It also discusses the theories they propounded about life, theology and the nature of the universe. The story was written with the aid of historic letters of correspondence between √âmilie and Voltaire, as well as between several other prominent figures of the Enlightenment. Citation The full bibliographic citation of the book in question is: *  Background  The novel is set in the period of development in Western Europe known as the Age of Enlightenment. At the time new scientific discoveries were being made, and people began to question society and the ruling classes. The story is set against a backdrop of social and political turmoil. The book takes place over a period of 43 years, from 1706 to 1749.  Themes  The book utilizes several themes to convey its story to the reader. Predominate themes include the rights of women. Though not actively campaigning for women's rights, this book highlights the way in which woman were treated during the pre-Enlightenment period. This is emphasized by the manner in which du Ch√¢telet's scientific breakthroughs and discoveries are passed off as unimportant, simply because of her gender.  Plot  The book starts with a \\"flash forward\\" in which √âmilie du Ch√¢telet is briefly introduced. It is June in the year 1749, and √âmilie is in the final stages of her pregnancy. She is struggling to complete a book of her theories and calculations, and fears that she will not have enough time to finish the thesis. The book then jumps back in time to the year 1706, and to a younger √âmilie. She has not yet met Voltaire, and is but ten years old. She lives with her parents, and is considered an unusual child because of her love of books and reading.  References  Further reading * In the frontispiece to their translation of Newton, du Ch√¢telet is depicted as the muse of Voltaire, reflecting Newton's heavenly insights down to Voltaire. √âmilie du Ch√¢telet Novels about writers Novels set in France Novels set in the 18th century Little, Brown and Company books 2006 British novels Cultural depictions of Voltaire ","title":"Passionate Minds"},{"id":"18857517","text":"Messing Maypole Mill is a grade II listed Tower mill at Tiptree, Essex, England which has been converted to a residence. Prior to boundary changes made when the civil parish of Tiptree was established in 1934, the mill was in the parish of Tolleshunt Knights. History Messing Maypole Mill was built in 1775 by Colchester millwright John Mathett at a cost of ¬£315 excluding the brickwork. Matchett also rebuilt a post mill which stood some south west of the tower mill (TL 894 167) and sum of ¬£315 may include that work. Matchett owned the mill until it was purchased by miller Thomas Green in 1797. The mill passed to Edward Harvey on Green's death in 1806. Harvey died in 1829 and in 1829 the mill was purchased by miller James Peake. Peake was declared bankrupt in 1845 and the mill sold by his assignees. George Ransom was the next miller, and he introduced steam power. After the death of Ransom in 1884 the mill was run by his widow for a few years and then by Henry Cattermole. In 1890, the Colchester millwright Bryant replaced the old wooden windshaft with the cast iron windshaft from the annular sailed mill at Roxwell. Bryant may have added the fantail at this time. Milling by wind ceased c1911. During World War I the mill was worked by steam alone. Frederick King put the mill back to full working order in the 1920s, but the sails were finally removed in February 1927, leaving just the stocks. Milling continued until at least 1962, although the millstones were removed in 1960. Power latterly was by electricity. The mill was converted into a residence in 1969. Description Messing Maypole Mill is a four-storey brick tower mill with a domed cap. When built it had four Common sails carried on a wooden windshaft and was winded by hand. There was a stage at first floor level. The tower is diameter at base level, decreasing to at curb level. Height of the tower is to curb and the mill stands to the base of the finial on the cap, which was latterly winded by a fantail carried over the rear extension which housed the hand winding apparatus. The brickwork is thick at base level and thick at curb level. The diameter wooden Brake Wheel is of clasp arm construction, converted from compass arm. It has 72 cogs and is carried on a cast iron windshaft which formerly carried four double Patent sails. The brake wheel drove a wooden Wallower carried on a long wooden Upright Shaft. The diameter wooden Great Spur Wheel is of compass arm construction with 84 cogs. The mill latterly drove three pairs of millstones.

In 2000 he became the first ever Republican Speaker of the Virginia House and first non-Democratic Speaker since the Readjuster Party controlled the House in the early 1880s. Wilkins was considered the driving force in the expansion of Republican House membership in the 1980s and 1990s, especially after he became minority leader in 1992. In his first term as Speaker, he oversaw the redistricting of the House after the 2000 census that led to an increase in the Republican majority from 52-47 (1 independent) to 64-34 (2 independents) after the November 2001 election.  Eavesdropping Scandal  In March 2002, Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Edmund Matricardi III (R) pled guilty to eavesdropping on a Democratic Party conference call. State Attorney General Jerry Kilgore (R) investigated, which expanded to include Speaker Vance Wilkins and his Chief of Staff, Claudia D. Tucker, who pled guilty resigned, was fined $1,000 and given a year probation.  Sexual Harassment Scandal  Then, on June 7, 2002, The Washington Post reported that executives of Wilkins' former construction company had revealed that Wilkins had paid $100,000 to a former political staffer, Jennifer L.

It is based on Le nain rouge, a story by Michel Tournier.  Synopsis  Lucien L'Hotte, a dwarf becomes enamoured and begins an affair with the singer Paola Bendoni. Lucien excuses himself from her company and, in a dramatic scene, indulges in her luxurious bathtub and emerges and boldly pursues an affair with the singer, who is in the midst of divorce. After some time her problems with her husband subside and the two make amends, and Lucien is driven mad, proclaiming, \\"If you do not love me, I love you. And if I love you beware\\". Lucien then contrives her murder and frames her husband successfully, and disappears shortly after to live as a carnie. There he falls in platonic love with the carnival director's pre-pubescent daughter which arouses the suspicion of paedophilic motivations by the director, who forbids his daughter to see or perform with L'Hotte. On the verge of being ostracised from the carnival, L'Hotte creates a show of his own that becomes wildly popular--and in the process profitable to the director. L'Hotte then stages a homosexual relationship with his partner in his carnival act to settle suspicions of unwanted interest in the young girl.

Life Born William Gifford in Hampshire to John Gifford, Esq., of Weston-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir George Throckmorton, Knight of Coughton, Warwickshire,Wood 1815 he was sent to Oxford in 1569, where he was entrusted to the care of John Bridgewater, President of Lincoln College, who was a Catholic at heart. Gifford remained at Oxford for about four years, part of which time he spent in the celebrated boarding school kept by the Catholic physician, Dr Etheridge, where he had been placed on the compulsory retirement of Bridgewater for refusal to conform. After that period, Gifford, accompanied by his tutor, proceeded to the Catholic University of Louvain (1573), resumed there his studies, and took the degree of Master of arts. After having also obtained his baccalaureate in theology on the completion of a four-year course in that science under Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, Gifford was forced to quit Leuven owing to the disturbances in the Low Countries. Gifford pursued his ecclesiastical studies at Paris, at the University of Reims, which he visited (1577) at the invitation of Cardinal William Allen, and at the English College at Rome, to which he was admitted as a student on 15 September 1579.Foley 1880, p. 139; but compare statement there given as to age with date of birth above. Having been ordained priest in March 1582,Foley 1880, p. 139 he was recalled to Reims by Allen to be the professor of theology at the English College there.Douay Diaries: Diarium Primum, 11; Diarium Secundum, 189 - note statement as to age. The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on Gifford in December 1584 by the Jesuit University of Pont-√†-Mousson (now the University of Nancy), after which, returning to Reims, Gifford taught theology at intervals for nearly twelve years. Upon Allen's elevation to the cardinalate, Gifford accompanied him to Rome in the capacity of chaplain, and it is said that during this visit he resided for a time in the household of Charles Borromeo. About this time (1597) Gifford was appointed to the deanery of Lille, which office Pope Clement VIII conferred on him at the urging, it is alleged, of the Archbishop of Milan. This dignity he retained for about ten years, and, after his withdrawal from Lille (c. 1606), he was made \\"Rector magnificus\\" of Reims University. In 1608, Gifford, who had always esteemed the Benedictines, and befriended them in many ways, took the habit of that order under the religious name of Gabriel of St Mary and subsequently became prior of the Monastery of St. Lawrence at Dieulouard (Dieulewart), now Ampleforth Abbey in England. In 1611, Gifford was sent to Brittany to lay the foundation of a small community of his order at St. Malo. He was favourably received by the bishop, and a chair of divinity was assigned to him.Petre 1849 He was one of the nine definitors chosen in 1617 to arrange the terms of union among the Benedictine congregations in England; he was elected first president of the province in May of the same year. In 1618, Gifford was consecrated coadjutor bishop to Cardinal Louis III, Cardinal of Guise, Archbishop of Reims, with the titular title of Bishop of Arcadiopolis in Thrace.* On the death of Guise, he succeeded to the archbishopric, becoming also, by virtue of his office, Duke of Reims and First Peer of France. Concerning his administration of Reims, Joseph Bergin has written, \\"Despite vast experience, he was too old by 1622 to achieve much in [the] badly neglected diocese.\\" Works Before Guifford's death, which occurred in 1629 at Reims, he had acquired a high reputation as a preacher. His writings include: *\\"Oratio Funebris in exequiis venerabilis viri domini Max√¶miliani Manare pr√¶positi ecclesi√¶ D. Petri oppidi Insulensis\\" (Douai, 1598); *\\"Orationes divers√¶\\" (Douai); *\\"Calvino-Turcismus\\", etc. (Antwerp, 1597 and 1603). The latter work, begun by Dr. Reynolds, Clifford completed and edited. He translated from the French of Fronto-Duc√¶us, S.J., \\"The Inventory of Errors, Contradictions, and false Citations of Philip Mornay, Lord of Plessis and Mornay\\". He also wrote, at the request of the Duke of Guise, a treatise in favour of the Ligue. The \\"Sermones Adventuales\\" (Reims, 1625) were a Latin rendering by Gifford of discourses originally delivered in French. He assisted Dr. Anthony Champney in his \\"Treatise on the Protestant Ordinations\\" (Douai, 1616); other of Gifford's MSS. were destroyed in the burning of the monastery at Dieulouard in 1717.

He was the grandson of famous Islamic scholar and leader Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1703 - 1762). When a new Islamic religious revivalist movement appeared in northern India under the leadership of Syed Ahmad Barelvi (1786 - 1831), he was joined by two members of the Shah Waliullah family: Shah Ismail Dehlavi (1771-1831) and Maulvi Abdul Hai (died 1828)Dr. Mubarak Ali, ‚ÄúAlmiyah- e-Tarikh‚Äù, Chapter 11, pp.107-121, Fiction House, Lahore (2012). who joined it because they shared its mission and objectives. \\"The agenda of the new movement known as Tariqah-i-Muhammadiyah was to purify the tenets of Islam from Hindu customs, traditions and cultural practices.\\"Past present: When history fails Dawn (newspaper), Published 3 March 2012, Retrieved 16 August 2018 \\"His motive was to convince the Muslim community to purify Islam from Hindu influences and Shiite rituals. He was harsh in his criticism and believed that religion should be practiced in its original form; a thought process which gradually evolved into a Jihad movement.\\" Barbara Metcalf writes: \\"Sayyid Ahmad's reformist teachings were set down in two works that, when printed on the new lithographic press of the day, soon achieved wide circulation. The Sirat'ul Mustaqim (the Straight Path) was compiled by Muhammad Ismail in 1819. Written initially in Persian, it was translated into Urdu in order to reach a wider audience. The second work, Taqwiyatul-Iman or the strengthening of the Faith, was written directly in Urdu. The two works stressed above all the centrality of tawhid, the transcendent unity of God, and denounced all those practices and beliefs that were held in any way to compromise that most fundamental of Islamic tenets. God alone was held to be omniscient and omnipotent. He alone, entitled to worship and homage. There were, the followers of Sayyid Ahmad argued, three sources of threat to this belief: false sufism, Shi√° doctrines and practices, and popular custom\\".B. Metcalf, \\"Islamic revival in British India: Deoband, 1860‚Äì1900\\", pp. 56 - 57, Princeton University Press (1982). According to Andreas Rieck, Syed Ahmad visited towns of North Indian planes from 1818 to 1821 with hundreds of missionaries to preach against Shia beliefs and practices. Syed Ahmad repeatedly destroyed ta'ziyas, an act that resulted in subsequent riots and chaos.Andreas Rieck, \\"The Shia's of Pakistan\\", p. 16, Oxford University Press (2016). Barbara Metcalf offers the following explanation to his anti-shi'ism: \\"A second group of Abuses Syed Ahmad held were those that originated from Shi‚Äôi influence. He particularly urged Muslims to give up the keeping of ta‚Äôziyahs. The replicas of the tombs of the martyrs of Karbala taken in procession during the mourning ceremony of Muharram. Muhammad Isma‚Äôil wrote, ‚Äòa true believer should regard the breaking a tazia by force to be as virtuous an action as destroying idols. If he cannot break them himself, let him order others to do so. If this even be out of his power, let him at least detest and abhor them with his whole heart and soul‚Äô. Sayyid Ahmad himself is said, no doubt with considerable exaggeration, to have torn down thousands of imambaras, the building that house the taziyahs\\".B. Metcalf, \\"Islamic revival in British India: Deoband, 1860‚Äì1900\\", p. 58, Princeton University Press (1982). In 1821, Shah Ismail left for Hajj along with Syed Ahmad and a group of his devotees. He returned from Haj in 1823, and once again visited different parts of India. For Syed Ahmad and the followers of the Faraizi movement, India was ‚ÄúDarul Harb‚Äù the capital of war and therefore jihad was obligatory for the Muslims. In his book, Sirat-e-Mustaqeem, Shah Ismail Dehlavi wrote: ‚Äúa large part of present-day India has become ‚ÄúDar-ul-Harab‚Äù. Compare the situation with the heavenly blessings of India two and three hundred years ago‚Äù. Comparing India with Darul Islam, he said: ‚Äúcompare India with Rome and Turkey in terms of heavenly blessings‚Äù. Establishment of Islamic State The objectives of this movement was to establish an Islamic state where the Muslim community could observe pure teachings of Islam. At that time, much of North India was ruled by the British. So this movement leadership concluded that they should move to an area with less control of the British and with large majority of Muslim population - North-West Frontier region which is now called Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. \\"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region was chosen to carry out this experimentation, based on the assumption that being devout Muslims, the Pakhtuns would support the reformist movement.\\".Past present: The intolerant invaders Dawn (newspaper), Published 12 June 2013, Retrieved 16 August 2018 When the action began, some Muslim nawabs, like Amir Khan of Tonk, provided funds but did not join them for jihad. Around 8,000 holy-warriors who accompanied them were mostly clergymen or poor people who joined the militia were looking for employment. The rulers of Tonk, Gwalior and Rampur supported him with British consent because they were dependent on British forces and they knew well enough that the British would not stop them from aiding an enemy of the Sikhs. Since Syed Ahmad‚Äôs campaign was based on Islamic concept of jihad, his spokesman, Shah Ismail Dehlavi, tries to create desire for the war by saying: ‚Äúas far as the special (sexual) benefits are concerned that go to the faithful Martyrs, the Muslim Mujahideen, the ruling Sultans and the brave men of the battle field, don‚Äôt need to be elaborated here‚Äù. Arriving in Peshawar valley in late 1826, Sayyid Ahmad and his followers made their base in towns of Hund and Zaida in Swabi DistrictWahhabi movement in India. Qeyamuddin Ahmad, (1994, p.50). open library Dehlavi and Syed Ahmad preached jihad amongst the local Pashtun tribes, demanding they renounce their tribal customs and adopt the Shariah. The traditional khan were replaced by ulama (clerics) and a system of Islamic taxes was established to finance the jihad. Only after this evangelist campaign and sharia system was had set up was jihad declared. He sent a message to Ranjit Singh to ‚Äúeither become a Muslim, pay Jizyah or fight and remember that in case of war, Yaghistan supports the Indians‚Äù. The mujahideen received both ideological preaching and physical training sessions. Syed Ahmad and Ismail Dehlavi organized wrestling, archery training and shooting competitions. The mujahideen also sang anthems. One such anthems has survived, known as \\"Risala Jihad\\", it goes as follows: \\"War against the Infidel is incumbent on all Musalmans; make provisions for all things. He who from his heart gives one farthing to the cause, shall hereafter receive seven hundred fold from God. He who shall equip a warrior in this cause of God, shall hereafter obtain a martyr's reward; His children dread not the trouble of the grave, nor the last trump, not the Day of Judgement. Cease to be crowds; join the divine leader, and smite the Infidel. I give thanks to God that a great leader has been born, in the thirteenth of the Hijra\\".Charles Allen, \\"God's Terrorists: The Wahhabi Cult and the Hidden Roots of Modern Jihad\\", p. 86, Abacus (2006). In December 1826 they clashed with Sikh troops at Akora with some success. On 11 January 1827, allegiance was sworn on his hand and Syed Ahmad was declared Caliph and Imam. Syed Ahmad‚Äôs claim of leadership (Caliphate) was viewed with suspicion in the Frontier region as well as in the clerical circles of North India. When the Friday sermon was read in his name, it became clear to the tribal chiefs that he wanted the political power for himself. According to Khadi Khan, a Pathan sardar: ‚Äúit is the job of the Sardars to take care of the people, not a Maulvi who spends his life on donations. Maulvies are ill-equipped to run the affairs of a State‚Äù. Syed Ahmad tried to explain that his aim was not this-worldly but to lead jihad against the infidels. In one of his letters, he writes: ‚ÄúWe thank and praise God, the real master and the true king, who bestowed upon his humble, recluse and helpless servant the title of Caliphate, first through occult gestures and revelations, in which there is no room for doubt, and then by guiding the hearts of the believers towards me. This way God appointed me as the Imam (leader)‚Äù. Criticizing the opponents, Shah Ismail Dehlavi wrote: ‚Äútherefore, obedience to Syed Ahmad is obligatory on all Muslims. Whoever does not accept the leadership of His Excellency or rejects it after accepting it, is an apostate and mischievous, and killing him is part of the jihad as is the killing of the disbelievers. Therefore, the appropriate response to opponents is that of the sword and not the pen‚Äù. Regarding his Imamate, Syed Ahmad wrote to Nawab Wazir ud-Dawla, the ruler of Tonk: ‚Äúbelieve me, the person who sincerely confesses to my position is special in the eyes of God, and the one who denies it is, of course sinful. My opponents who deny me of this position will be humiliated and disgraced‚Äù. Mubarak Ali writes: \\"After the conquest of Peshawar, Syed Ahmad launched a violent policy to enforce Shari‚Äôah and announced the abolition of all tribal rituals that he considered illegal. The most important of these rituals were: the bride was paid a regular price for marriage, the wives of the deceased were divided among his heirs, more than four marriages were practiced, women could not inherit property, internecine wars were considered jihad and plunder was considered booty. Therefore, after the conquest of Peshawar, orders were issued that those who can give half of the agreed money to the brides can take them. The young girls (9 year old and above) who are eligible for marriage should be married immediately. To enforce Shari‚Äôah law, he appointed Imam Qutbuddin as an ombudsman, accompanied by 30 armed soldiers, who accompanied him to nearby villages to beat up the people who had abandoned prayers. Beatings and flogging had become the norm, that if the ombudsman went to any village, panic would spread. Punishment was carried out with extreme violence and people were even hanged on tree branches. Even among women, those who missed prayers were punished in the women‚Äôs quarters, so people soon became fed up with these polices because these judges and ombudsmen started harassing people and imposed fines on them beyond their means\\". In addition to the stated social agenda, Sayyid Ahmad also attempted to collect the Islamic tithe (usher) of ten per cent of crop yields. The alliance was defeated and the Islamic reformers finally occupied Peshawar. Over several months during 1830 Sayyed Ahmad tried to conciliate established power hierarchies. But before the end of 1830 an organized uprising occurred and the agents of Sayyid Ahmad in Peshawar and in the villages of the plain were murdered and the movement retreated to hills. They ran into trouble in this area with many of these Pakhtun tribes because they had no cultural or linguistic relation to the locals and tried to wipe out their own old tribal rules and customs by force. Some of their old tribal leaders had sensed a threat to their own prevailing influence over the local tribal population and their traditional Pakhtun nationalism which they were not willing to give up and hand their power and influence over to the newcomers in their area in the name of Islam. Punjab, parts of North-West Frontier and Kashmir regions, in 1831, were under the strict rule of powerful Maharaja Ranjit Singh who also had future ambitions to control all of the North-West Frontier region of the Pashtuns. So he sent his powerful Sikh army to fight them and after a fierce battle, defeated them, at Balakot. There in the town of Balakot in 1831, Syed Ahmad was killed by the Sikh Army. He was beheaded.Qeyamuddin Ahmad, Wahhabi movement in India, (1994, p.55)Grave of Syed Ahmed Shaheed in 2014. Death and legacy Ismail Dehlvi was killed on 6 May 1831 during a fierce battle at Balakot against the army of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780 - 1839), the ruler of the region at that time. \\"Traditional historians accused the Pakhtun tribes of betraying the religious cause and glorified the role of the movement.\\" Some other historians point out that the British government silently supported the movement and its planned migration to the North-West Frontier region. \\"Most probably, the British government wanted to shift the troublesome elements from the territory under their control to that of the Sikhs' in order to weaken the Sikh rule.\\" Literary works * Taqwiyat-ul-Iman (Strengthening of the Faith), (an online book translated in English from the original book written by Dehlvi) * Sirat-al-Mustaqeem (Right Path) Gallery References External links Syed Ahmed Barelvi and his Jihad movement eBook in Urdu language on Shah Ismail Shaheed with introduction by Abu Ala Maududi, Published 1 October 1943 by Qaumi Kutub Khana, Lahore * Taqwiyat-ul-Iman (Strengthening of the Faith) an eBook translated in English and originally written by Shah Ismail Dehlvi on islamhouse.com website 1779 births 1831 deaths Shah Ismail Delvi 19th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Indian Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam Indian Islamists ","title":"Shah Ismail Dehlvi"},{"id":"18858282","title":"Ministry for Social Equality"},{"id":"18858307","text":"S630 may refer to : * S630 Aristo, a TOM'S complete car * Canon S630, a Canon S Series digital camera * HTC S630, a tri band mobile phone ","title":"S630"},{"id":"18858309","text":"Clarizen, Inc. is a project management software and collaborative work management company.

Located at the heart of the city, it derives its name from the museum's location at No. 8 Queen Street near Bras Basah Road. SAM at 8Q is also approximately 88 steps away from Singapore Art Museum. History The 4-storey building was formerly the primary school wing of the Catholic High School. When the School relocated to their current location in 1987, the 3,500 sq m space gave home to the Kim Yan Cantonese Methodist Church. In September 2007, the Church ended its tenancy and the building was repossessed by the Singapore Land Authority. Launch With new interest on contemporary art by the young, the National Heritage Board (NHB) took up tenancy of the building from the Land Authority. The Board also spent $5.8 million on renovations, and converted the classrooms in the 4-storey building into six galleries to showcase contemporary installation works, video and photography installation, performance art and sound art. A lift was also installed, and the galleries, staircases and parts of corridors have also been air-conditioned and humidity- controlled. There are also spaces to house two restaurants on the ground floor which are currently occupied by Love Pal Cafe and Standing Sushi Bar. SAM at 8Q was officially opened on 15 August 2008 with an inaugural 8-man art exhibition titled 8Q-Rate: School; a name pun from the word 'curate'. 8Q-Rate featured the works by young contemporary artists such as :Jahan Loh, Donna Ong, Grace Tan, Chong Li Chuan, Jason Wee, Tan Kai Syng, Phunk and sculptor Ahmad Abu Bakar.

It represents around 90 different conservatories and zoos in Southeast Asia. SEAZA became a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) in 1990. SEAZA Headquarters are currently located in Taiwan. SEAZA is considered a sister organization to the South Asian Zoo Association for Regional Cooperation (SAZARC), which organizes zoos in Nepal, India and other countries in South Asia. Although they preside over two similar regions, the cultures and policies of the regions are too different for a single organization to govern both. The main goals of the SEAZA are to, ‚ÄúStrengthen in-situ conservation and management plans, to increase captive breading through research, to improve standards of non human animal welfare, to provide better recreational learning experiences for zoo visitors, to educate the public about the importance of wildlife conservation, and to promote tourism in Southeast Asia.‚Äù Achieving SEAZA‚Äôs goals is particularly important as Southeast Asia is one of the most biologically diverse regions in the world, but rapid, recent economic growth of these countries has caused this rare ecosystem to be put in jeopardy. However, today SEAZA is facing significant challenges that is putting its future viability in jeopardy.  History  Although many zoos existed in Southeast Asia before 1990, there was no formal organization linking these zoos. As more private zoos in Southeast Asia opened to the public and as Southeast Asia became a part of the modern world, there was pressure for their zoos to meet western ethical standards. Many of these zoos had very different governing policies set by their country, while others had no formally established policy. This led to the desire to create some form of governing body that could set standards for all types of zoos across the region. The initiative to form an association of zoos in SEA originated in 1988 at a conference of zoos at the Negara Zoo in Malaysia. The Negara Zoo Director, Idris Malik, wrote the proposal for the creation of SEAZA. In 1989, the zoos met again and the retired Indonesian Military Director, Danudirdjo Ashari, pushed the organization into the official stage and brought it to the WAZA, where it was officially recognized as a member in 1990. Ashari served as the President of SEAZA from 1993 to 1995. Bernard Harrison, the Director of the Singapore Zoo, became President in 1996. At that time, many of the zoos had no operating guidelines or policies. Harrison worked with all the members of SEAZA to establish a written constitution that would guide behavior for zoos in Southeast Asia in 1998. Harrison also established sub committees on breeding, ethics, conservation, and public education. He instituted yearly meetings instead of bi-yearly meetings in 1998. This was motivated in part by the economic crisis of 1997 that started in Thailand and caused the SEAZA to miss their scheduled meeting in Ho Chi Minh City. In 2001 SEAZA held its 10th meeting in Malaysia to establish their sisterhood with SAZARC. In the mid-2000s, Dr Phan Viet Lam, the director of the Saigon Zoo, took over as president and is currently in office. SEAZA held its 21st yearly conference in November 2013 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The conference had six focus areas: breeding and zoo veterinary services, marketing and zoo education, biodiversity and conservation, zoo design and environment enrichment, ethical standards in animal care, and multiplication and animal habitat. Representatives from all 12 countries and territories were present. The 22nd SEAZA conference is scheduled to take place at the Taipei Zoo in October 2014. The theme of this year‚Äôs conference is developing a ‚ÄúOne Plan Approach‚Äù with focused sessions on standardizing economic policies and procedures with a connection to marketing, creating a sustainable standard of animal care, and veterinarian education in areas such as radiology and ultrasounds. Philosophy and Beliefs  Entrance to the Taipei Zoo SEAZA deals with more diverse cultural and economic environments than most members of WAZA. Consequently, SEAZA is the only member of the WAZA that does not have completely universal Ethical and Welfare standards across zoos. However, all members must meet certain baselines and provide certain rights to remain a part of SEAZA. These are as follows, ‚Ä¢ Animals should have access to sufficient food ‚Ä¢ Access to sufficient drinking water ‚Ä¢ Shelter to inclement weather ‚Ä¢ A clean enclosure to reduce the spread of infectious diseases ‚Ä¢ Responsible staff to care for them when they are in distress ‚Ä¢ All animals should exhibit normal behavior. While these are universally defined health standards, differences in religious beliefs from country to country prevent a prescriptive approach to defining how animals are cared for. For example, because Thailand is a Buddhist nation, they are forbidden from even euthanizing animals that are sick and in pain with no hope of recovery. Because of these varying beliefs, the Ethics Committee of SEAZA takes into account the ethical standards of the country and the people who work there. In addition to respecting the regional ethical beliefs of the area where a zoo is located, SEAZA tries not to favor rich zoos over poor zoos. SEAZA is the only world zoo organization with different membership criteria for rich zoos and poor zoos. This has led some experts to claim that the SEAZA is more like an organization of refugee camps for animals who were displaced from their natural habitats. With respect to conservation and species rehabilitation, SEAZA attempts to enforce the mandates of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered species (CITES) established in Geneva Switzerland in 1973 that set up policies on trading and exporting animals across international borders. Many Southeast Asia animals are heavily regulated under this treaty, due to a recent loss of habitat. Structure of SEAZA and organization According to the SEAZA constitution written in 1998, SEAZA has defined a zoo as ‚Äúzoological gardens, biological parks, safari parks, public aquariums, bird parks, reptile parks insectariums, and other collections of wildlife primarily for public exhibition.‚Äù While this is the general definition, most of the members of SEAZA are traditional zoos located on approximately 300 acres of land, have anywhere from 200-500 animals, about 35-40 zookeepers, and 2-4 veterinarians. There are two different membership categories. The first is a Southeast Asia institutional ordinary member. These members are zoo, wild life parks, and conservancies that meet the SEAZA standards. These standards are as follows.  Have regular and predictable visiting hours that are convenient for the public.  Provide a comprehensive exhibit of animals that spans beyond domestic pets.  Have a primary mission of the member to exhibit, conserve, and preserve the world‚Äôs fauna in a scientific and educational manner.  Promote these goals throughout other zoos. The second class of members is an associate member, which consists of organizations and non-profit groups that support SEAZA, but have no geographical ties to the region. There is a General Assembly consisting of one of representative from each of the member countries. The representative is the President of the national zoo of each of the countries or territories. In the case of a country or territory with no national zoo, the zoos in that country must come to a consensus on their representative. The General Assembly is mandated to meet every three years, but typically meets each year. They can decide new policies and procedure through a majority rules voting system. There is an Executive Board that has three members. It is led by a President who is elected for three-year terms by the General Assembly and can run for as many terms as he would like. A Vice President is also elected every three years. The final member of the committee is the immediate Past President. The Executive Board can establish any committees that they feel are necessary. The Executive Board meets twice a year at minimum. In these meetings they discuss budget and reports of the committees. The final permanent governance body is the Ethics and Welfare Committee. At the SEAZA conference in 1998, the Executive Board became concerned with the ethics and welfare standards in the zoos. They decided to initiate a committee for animal welfare. They appointed Govindasamy Agoramoorthy from the Tajen Institute of Technology in Thailand as the head of the committee. The objective of the survey was not to scientifically assess these zoos against western standards, but to evaluate zoos based upon their cultural and regional ethical standards, to identify, fix and prevent welfare related problems in the zoos of Southeast Asia. All zoos that were deemed representative of Zoos in Southeast Asia by the SEAZA board were informed of the evaluation, and then given the opportunity of inviting the ethics board to their zoo. The ethics and welfare evaluation committee consisted of Zoo manager‚Äôs, both from the zoo under investigation, Conservation specialist and animal rights activists. These committee members and 3-6 workers at each zoo formed an evaluation committee. This was done to ensure that the local ethics of a region were taken into account when evaluating a zoo. A special focus was paid to animal husbandry, disposal of surplus animals and acquisition of animals for breeding purposes. At each zoo, evaluators picked the animals they specifically wanted to focus on. The evaluation focused on elephants Asiatic black bears, and orangutans because large animals require higher living standards, and more stimulation. Finally these animals were chosen because they are deemed critical to the conservation efforts of the countries of Southeast Asia. This has now become a standing committee overseen directly by the President. Its job is to define ethics standards and perform ethics evaluations at frequent intervals to make sure that all member zoos meet the ethics and welfare standards. The headquarters of the SEAZA is located at the zoo of the current president.  List of Membership Countries  Brunei, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Problems and Poverty The American Black Bear in the Surabaya (Indonesia) Zoo suffers from skin disease. The Convention on International Trade of Endangered species CITES regulates all animal trade, rescue and reintroduction into the wild on the global level. However many countries in Southeast Asia view this agreement as a secondary concern. Most policies in Southeast Asia focus on the conservation of entire ecosystems and little on specific species that are endangered. Because Southeast Asia nations lack the resources to support both imperatives, SEAZA has a hard time enforcing the regulations of CITES prohibiting exhibiting some animals illegally and controlling the exportation of native species such as sun bears. Due to SEAZA‚Äôs inability to regulate some species, many private internationally conservations and organizations have stepped in for the protection and preservation of specific species such as Malaysian sun bear. The Ho Chi Minh City Zoo has a partnership with the Cologne Zoo in Germany. The Cologne Zoo works with SEAZA to conserve insect and reptile species, as well as working with Malaysia to rehabilitate the Malaysian sun bear species. In fact the Malaysian sun bear studbook is at the Cologne Zoo. Most of the zoos in Southeast Asia, with the noticeable exception of Singapore, can be classified as in some sort of critical status. There are two major contributing factors to this issue. The first of these is that most of the 12 countries that make up SEAZA cannot afford to supply a substantial budget to zoos. Most of these zoos struggle to meet the minimum standards of wellness, while many others fall below it. As well as government not being able to fund zoos, tourism is not covering the cost of zoos because most international tourists prefer to visit sanctuaries such as the Sun Bear Sanctuary in Malaysia, which is a privately owned, for-profit organization. The second contributing factor to the problems of the zoos is that most of the natural environment of the animals that live in Southeast Asia (58% of all animal species in the world) is being destroyed by deforestation and rapid development. Most government-funded zoos are required to take rescue animals whether or not they have the ability, capacity, or budget to take in these recently displaced animals. As a result of a barely sufficient budget and a recent influx of displaced animals, most zoos are struggling with overcrowding and a surplus of animals. Another issue is that because of this poverty, WAZA and CITES have enforced policies about whether these zoos can have animals from other countries. For example, the Thailand Zoo has been rejected multiple times for the acquisition of a kangaroo, even though they are quite common in Australia and kangaroo meat is readily available in Thailand. This has reduced revenue from domestic tourism. Many SEAZA conventional zoos (non-sanctuary or wildlife parks) have come under direct scrutiny, and most are falling below standards, causing fractures in the foundation of SEAZA, and rather than stepping up to fix these standards, the once prominent organization appears to be retreating away from the line of sight of western countries and scrutiny. Two specific incidents illustrate unfortunate trends. In the 1998 tai ping gorilla incident, many gorillas in Thailand were found to be undocumented and owned illegally. This spurred a series of investigations and allegations about SEAZA and was followed by a series of police raids on zoos and conservatory parks. The largest controversy for SEAZA started in 2014 at the Surabaya Zoo. It has been called the ‚ÄúIndonesia Zoo of Death.‚Äù The controversy started in January 2014 when a young lion was found hanged in his cage, after suspiciously getting caught in his ropes while playing. The Zoo destroyed the evidence before a police investigation could take place. This incident started an investigation where many animals were found to be kept in poor condition and suffering from disease or malnutrition and neglect from keepers. There are currently many petitions to shut down the Zoo. SEAZA has made no formal statement about the Zoo. As a result, WAZA has directly started to investigate the zoo.  The Future of SEAZA  In recent years the level of competence within SEAZA appears to have declined. In 2005 an Ethics Board was scheduled to report on welfare and living standards of the animals in the zoos across Southeast Asia, but no report has been published The website for SEAZA became inaccessible in 2010. The organization is still in existence and a member of WAZA, bit its ability to monitor the zoos of Southeast Asia is in question As certain zoos grow successfully, like the Singapore National Zoo, and others struggle, like the Dusit Zoo in Thailand, it may have become impossible for a single organization and set of standards to cover the extremely economically diversified zoos of Southeast Asia. With current issues surrounding SEAZA and the deforestation and future endangerment of many SEA species of animals there is much that is requiring action. One possible future for these zoos involves more developed and richer zoos helping with animal rehabilitation and rescue efforts. This includes taking some of the surplus animals as to not stress conditions and resources any farther than they are now. Another potential mitigation for the current issues that was discussed during the 2013 SEAZA Conference stressed the importance of partnerships with Western zoos such as the Cologne Zoo. It is unclear the direction that the SEAZA Conference will take in 2014 after the recent controversies and public attention that some of its members have received. However, actions will be required to reestablish SEAZA as an effective organization and advocate for endangered species.

The Black Balloon Jack (as Jimmy The Exploder) co-produced and wrote the screenplay for the Australian feature film The Black Balloon with director Elissa Down. The pair recruited Strictly Ballroom producer Tristram Miall to produce the film. The narrative is semi-autobiographical, mostly drawn from Down's childhood experiences, but she asked Jack to join her in writing the screenplay. Jack won Best Original Screenplay and Best Film at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards. Jack caused a minor controversy when accepting his award he read out a negative review of the film and declared \\"Fuck You\\" to the critic, for which he received a standing ovation. Jack also won the 2007 Western Australian Premier's Book Award and the 2008 Australian Writer's Guild AWGIE Award for the screenplay. Other Film Work In 2009 it was reported that international model Gemma Ward (who acted in The Black Balloon) would be starring in Jack's next feature film Sex, Brains & Rock 'n' Roll. Jack described it as a 'zombie rockumentary' and told reporters that he was looking at Macaulay Culkin to play the other lead role. In 2010 Jack uploaded material onto a YouTube channel 'EXPLODERVISION'. The channel featured obscure videos starring himself performing mundane tasks. Writing Jack (as Jimmy The Exploder) has contributed to publications including The Guardian. His more notable publications have been social commentary on his hometown of Perth, and an obituary for his friend artist Matt Doust. Exhibition and Distribution In 2010 Jack curated the John Hughes Retrospective at the Northbridge Piazza, funded by the City of Perth. In 2013 Jack founded the film sales and distribution company Video Archives. The company was named after the video store Quentin Tarantino worked at in Los Angeles before his career took off. Jack was one of the founders of the Perth Underground Film Festival (PUFF) which was part of the Perth Fringe Festival in 2015. Henry Saw and the Museum of Perth In 2015 Jack worked together with a group of prominent Western Australians to found the Museum of Perth. Jack owned Henry Saw cafe which was neighbours with the museum and named after the grocer who first roasted coffee beans in Perth. Babooshka Jack owned Babooshka cafe in Northbridge, Western Australia. In 2015 the cafe launched a series of 'freakshakes' that went viral and received international press. Criminal convictions In December 2018 Jack appeared in Perth Magistrates Court on five charges including two counts of breaching protective bail conditions, disorderly behaviour in public, obstructing public officers and common assault. Jack plead guilty and received fines. From the same incident, Jack was also convicted in a District Court trial of one count of deprivation of liberty. In March 2019, Judge Ronald Birmingham sentenced him to an 18 month suspended sentence for which he may face jail time if he offends again during that period. In popular culture Jack was spoofed by Australian filmmakers Henry and Aaron in Henry & Aaron's 7 Steps to Superstardom, The Ballad of Danny Danielson and Henry & Aaron‚Äôs ABC2 Xmas Quickie.

She has taught in higher education in London, England since 1970, at Middlesex Polytechnic from 1973. In 1999 she was appointed Anniversary Professor of Psychology and Gender Studies at Birkbeck, University of London, where she now works in the School of Psychosocial Studies. Early life Segal is the daughter of Iza and Reuben Segal, who were both physicians. Her brother Graeme is a mathematician, her sister Barbara a baroque dancer. She was born in Sydney, and studied psychology at Sydney University, obtaining her PhD in 1969, while immersed in the anti-authoritarian milieu of the Sydney Libertarians (known as 'The Push'), and has always remained within the libertarian wing of Left politics. Emigration to London She emigrated to London in 1970 and for the next decade her main energies went into grass roots politics in Islington, North London, helping to set up and run a women's centre, an alternative newspaper, the Islington Gutter Press, and supporting anti-racist politics. It was a decade in which the extra-party Left was on the ascendant, but divided structurally and ideologically. In 1979, the three friends, Segal, Sheila Rowbotham and Hilary Wainwright wrote Beyond the Fragments, arguing for broader alliances among trade unionists, feminists and left political groups. Its argument quickly won a large following leading to a major conference in Leeds, Yorkshire, in 1980 and a second edition in 1981. In 1984, publisher Ursula Owen invited her to join the Virago Advisory Board and write an appraisal of the state of feminism, resulting in her first book, Is the Future Female? Troubled Thoughts on Contemporary Feminism. This book reached a broad audience, with its questioning of gender mythologies, whether of women's intrinsic virtues, or men's inevitable rapaciousness, which had been appearing in the work of many popular feminist writers in the 1980s. Reflecting her socialist feminist milieu, Segal argued that feminists always needed to confront the ubiquitous negation of the 'feminine', but women's battles could neither be reduced simply to battles with men, nor solved purely by revaluing the 'feminine'. All Segal's consequent books have argued for a more inclusive form of left-feminism, arguing for a more compassionate and egalitarian world. Her next book, Slow Motion: Changing Masculinities, Changing Men rejected the equating of 'male sexuality' with 'male violence', noting the complexity of forces generating very differing patterns of masculinity across time and place. Discussing the volatile fluidity of sexual experience, the same theoretical perspectives appeared in Straight Sex: The Politics of Pleasure. There she deconstructs the notion of male activity and female passivity that underpin normative understandings of heterosexuality, and serve to shore up the language and practices of male dominance. In 2007 Segal published Making Trouble: Life and Politics, a Political Memoir covering her generation of post-war activists, pondering what has become of their politics in the grimmer, more divided world of the 21st century. She has a son, Zim Segal, working in web technology. Segal has lived in Islington, North London since she arrived from Sydney. Since 2000, she has worked, as a secular Jew, with Jews for Justice for Palestinians, Independent Jewish Voices and Faculty for Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian Peace (FFIPP) engaged in efforts to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and create a just peace between Israel and Palestine.

His career is remembered by a succession of quarrels with his monarch and his uncle, archbishop Hincmar of Rheims. After initial loyalty to Charles trouble occurred from 868 due to the allocation of benefices on the see's estates. The conflict grew dangerous as it became embroiled in the larger dispute of Lotharingian succession following Lothair II‚Äôs attempted divorce from his wife. Hincmar‚Äôs struggle against his king provides a Carolingian example of early Medieval clerical exemption. Early life Hincmar was born near Boulogne sometime between 835 and 838. His mother died while he was young and thus he was moved to Rheims and brought up under the care of his maternal uncle. It appears that Hincmar was a child prodigy, mastering Latin grammar, elements of Greek and the work of the Church Fathers. His appointment as Bishop of Laon in 858 was the work of his uncle. Due to Hincmar of Rheims‚Äôs close relationship with Charles the Bald he was able to ‚Äòsecure the appointment of the episcopal candidates he favoured, including that of his own nephew to the strategically key bishopric of Laon. As a bishop Hincmar of Laon held a retinue of thirty to forty men, he was not the only Carolingian bishop to have a retinue of laymen. In 858 Charles the Bald‚Äôs brother Louis the German invaded the Kingdom of West Francia. As a vassal to Charles, Hincmar provided Charles with ‚Äòactive military service.‚Äô Hincmar evidently impressed his monarch by allowing Charles to raise troops from his episcopal see, as in 860 Charles returned much lost land to the church of Laon as a reward for this service.  Conflict with Charles the Bald (868 - 869)  After a decade as bishop of Laon, Hincmar came into conflict with Charles the Bald. In 868 charges were brought against the bishop regarding benefices within his see. Two vassals alleged that Hincmar was treating them unjustly, and that Hincmar had seized their benefices without justification. Another vassal also claimed that Hincmar had taken without reason from him a benefice that had previously been held by father. Charles the Bald demanded that Hincmar defend himself before a panel of secular judges. Hincmar disputed this, requesting clerical exemption from the royal court, and turned to his uncle for support. Hincmar of Rheims was ‚Äòalways zealous to guard the rights of the church.‚Äô As a result, Hincmar of Reims produced the Rotula in order to protect the right of his nephew to only be tried in an ecclesiastical court. The Rotula was a reactionary piece defending episcopal privileges, centrally clerical exemption. In effect Hincmar of Rheims collected various sources which espoused the right for a cleric to be tried in a secular court or punish those who tried clerics at a secular court. For example, ‚Äòthat no one should dare to accuse a bishop before public judges‚Äô from the ‚ÄòRoman Laws declared by Gratian, Valentinian and Theodoric‚Äô. These referral to older authorities of canon law increased the persuasiveness of the Rotula. Hincmar of Rheims also warned Charles that ‚Äòit was not the place of a king to publicly recriminate against a bishop, to summon him before a secular court.‚Äô Both Hincmars travelled to P√Ætres to meet the king in August 868. It was evident here that Charles was angered by Hincmar of Laon's actions and thus Hincmar of Reims watered down his defence of his nephew. Charles had previous experience of dealing with unruly bishops. Thirty years earlier at the trial of Bishop Samuel of Toulouse he stated that he; > ‚Äòwould not suffer bishops to be examined outside of the royal and lay > jurisdiction in matters pertaining to regalian rights and to the laws of the > kingdom.‚Äô Because of Hincmar of Reims's support for his nephew Charles ordered that the question would be handled by a synod. Hincmar of Laon then turned his attention over the Alps for support in preparation for his next conflict with the king. The bishop of Laon sent secret messengers to Pope Hadrian II regarding a disputed villa at Poilly, which Hincmar claimed belonged to Laon. At Quierzy in December 868 Hincmar produced the papal responses to the king which chided the king. Hadrian also commanded that the villa of Poilly was to be returned to Hincmar. Following this Charles's attempts to forcefully bring Hincmar into line were unsuccessful, partly due to the continued support of Hincmar of Rheims. Before attending the council of Verberie in April 869 Hincmar of Laon set up precautions in his see in case the council was a trap. While Charles did attempt to accuse Hincmar here he was halted by Hincmar of Rheims who again reiterated the principles detailed in the Rotula and presented at P√Ætres the year before. Hincmar of Laon still enjoyed his uncle's support. In this case, however, Hincmar of Rheims's concern was now for the church and for canon law rather than for his nephew. Again Hincmar of Laon turned to Pope Hadrian for support. He claimed that Charles was ‚Äòno more than a tyrant, an oppressor of the church and an invader of her property.‚Äô Furthermore, he also accused his uncle of failing in his duty to protect the church and his nephew. On May 27th 869, Charles imprisoned Hincmar of Laon. As a result, Hincmar put into action his plan prepared before Verberie a month prior. Thus, all holy offices in the diocese of Laon were prohibited. This only achieved in angering both Charles and Hincmar of Rheims. His uncle thus supported his imprisonment and wrote to Hincmar to raise this interdict. A month later, on June 24 at another annual assembly at P√Ætres Hincmar had yielded to the king. This occurred without his uncle's knowledge. This reconciliation with Charles was due to private agreement. Hincmar swore an oath of allegiance to the king in return for the disputed villa of Poilly's return to the see of Laon. Throughout this conflict it appears that Charles's response to Hincmar is somewhat overbearing. But alongside Hincmar's threats to involve the papacy he also threatened to switch allegiance to King Lothar II. This interfered with the key issue of diplomacy and politics in the realm. Indeed, in 868 following the death of Pope Nicholas I ‚Äì Hadrian's predecessor ‚Äì Lothar had tried to secure his position against his uncles; Charles the Bald and Louis the German. Thus, Lothar tried to enlist Hincmar of Laon, due to the bishop's current dispute with Charles. Lothar's attempted divorce from Theutberga was a key political issue as it potentially left him without an heir, thus providing an easy opportunity for Charles and Louis to seize the kingdom of Lotharingia. Therefore, threats to desert to Lothar were serious. Evidently Charles believed Hincmar was sincere in this as the monarch accused Hincmar of ‚Äòconspiring with Lothar II to desert his own king.‚Äô  Downfall (870 - 873)  On June 16th 870 Hincmar of Laon was called to the Synod of Attigny where Charles instructed Hincmar to renew his oath to his uncle. Hincmar was reluctant but eventually the pressure of the king and the archbishop was successful. At Attigny more accusations of a similar ilk to 868 were brought against Hincmar. Two days later, on June 18th, there was a royal tribunal. Two of Hincmar's men ‚Äì Ragenardus and Grivo ‚Äì accused him of expropriation. In his defence Hincmar asserted that the witnesses who knew the truth of what happened were not present, yet Charles forced him to answer. As a result, Hincmar accused both Ragenardus and Grivo of wrongdoing yet he was unable to substantiate these claims or back them up under oath. Fearing imprisonment, Hincmar fled back to Laon. This fear was not without basis, yet was an irrational and self-destructive move. Following the death of Lothar II in August 869 there is evidence linking Hincmar to the conspiracy of Carloman. Carloman was son of Charles the Bald who from an early age was excluded from inheriting his father's crown. Following Lothar's death, he was able to gather an aristocratic following in Lotharingia and vie in a grab for power around 870. Both Peter McKeon and Janet Nelson subscribe to the view that Hincmar was sympathetic to Carloman. The timings of Hincmar's renewed oaths, the backing of the pope to both Hincmar and Carloman, and both men's connections to Lotharingia offer a ‚Äòtantalising persistent thread.‚Äô While Nelson admits that none of the charges against Hincmar mention complicity with Carloman the timings of events ‚Äòseem more than a coincidence.‚Äô Only two days after Hincmar swore allegiance at Attingy (June 16) Carloman was arrested by Charles (June 18) and taken to the stronghold of Senlis. In 871 Hincmar of Rheims drew up a Synodal document to excommunicate Carloman and cease his grab for power. Hincmar of Laon's refusal to endorse this document proved to be a desperate and final act of defiance. > ‚ÄòAlready embroiled in major disputes with both his uncle and Charles the > Bald, and already suspected of conspiring with Lothar II, Hincmar of Laon > now brought down on himself the full extent of the king‚Äôs wrath.‚Äô In August 871 Hincmar was seized by royal agents at taken to Douzy where he appeared before an ecclesiastical court. Charles summoned eight archbishops and twenty-two bishops to preside over the Synod of Douzy. At Douzy Hincmar was deposed from episcopal and priestly rank. Pope Hadrian II attempted to intervene but Charles the Bald was successful in defending royal rights within his realm, and following his death in 872 the most powerful dissenting voice to the deposition of Hincmar was removed. Carloman was retried and blinded in 873, permanently ending his attempts to be king. Later in the year Hincmar of Laon was also blinded, by order of Count Boso. Nelson states that by doing this, Charles the Bald ‚Äòtook vengeance for what he clearly believed was continued complicity with Carloman.‚Äô Despite the decision reached at the Synod of Douzy it was not until 876, and with the permission of Pope John VIII that Archbishop Hincmar ordained his nephew's successor, Hedenulf, to the see of Laon.  Final years  Charles the Bald died in October 877 and following the passing of Hincmar's antagonist he enjoyed some recompense. At the Council of Troyes in 878 Pope John VIII restored Hincmar to the performance of priestly offices. He was also allowed part of the revenues of his former see. It was in these circumstances that Hincmar died in 881.
