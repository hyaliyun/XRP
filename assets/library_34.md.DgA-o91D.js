His biggest successes came when winning both the 1987 and 1988 runnings of the Queen Mother Champion Chase. Having also won the Grand Annual Chase in 1986, he is in a select band of horses who have won at the Cheltenham Festival in three consecutive years. He had fragile forelegs and was pin fired early in his career. When at his best, his performances were marked by his ability to quicken in the later stages of a race.  Background  Pearlyman had a distinctive white mark down his face. He was sired by Mandamus, a very useful one mile handicapper on the flat who was trained by Bernard van Cutsem. Pearlyman‚Äôs dam was a winning hurdler.  1982/1983 season  Pearlyman began his career in the Shropshire yard of Bill Jenks, who also bred him. He ran twice in juvenile hurdle races during this season. After being brought down on his debut, he then finished third at Stratford in March.  1983/1984 season  Still with Bill Jenks, Pearlyman ran only twice again. He was not seen out after finishing runner-up in a novice hurdle at Wolverhampton in November.  1984/1985 season  Pearlyman had now moved to the Ross-on-Wye stables of John Edwards, where he remained for the rest of his career. He appeared just once during this season, winning a novice hurdle at Wincanton in November with Paul Barton aboard.  1985/1986 season  Pearlyman switched to fences at the beginning of this season. He ran seven times, winning on five occasions, culminating in victories at both the big Cheltenham and Aintree meetings. He reappeared in a novices' chase at Wolverhampton on Boxing Day. Described as ‚Äòbackward‚Äô in appearance by the Raceform representative at the course, Pearlyman drew clear to win the race by twenty lengths.Chaseform Annual Jumping Season 1985/86 Published by Raceform Ltd He was then raised in class and lined up for an event at Ascot the following month. Both of his two opponents, including the highly promising Desert Orchid who started the warm favourite, failed to complete the course leaving Pearlyman to come home alone. He appeared again the following week at Kempton Park where he completed a hat- trick, leading at the tenth fence and winning by fifteen lengths. The merit of this performance also hard to gauge as the first and second favourites both fell during the race. Pearlyman returned to Ascot in February and suffered his first defeat over fences. He made a mistake at the eighth fence and came home in fourth place, fifteen lengths behind the winner, Charcoal Wally. Pearlyman was then put into open handicap company for his next outing which came in the nineteen-runner Grand Annual Chase at the Cheltenham Festival in March. With Graham Bradley deputising for Barton, Pearlyman started at 14/1, led at the final fence and passed the post three lengths ahead of his nearest rival. Barton was back aboard for when Pearlyman was next seen in a valuable novices chase at Aintree. Leading after halfway, Pearlyman pulled away from his opponents to pass the line twelve lengths ahead of Malya Mal. On his final outing of the season, Pearlyman narrowly failed to concede 10 pound (lb) to Amber Rambler in another valuable novice chase at Ayr, where he stumbled at the second last.  1986/1987 season  Pearlyman won three of his five starts including the Queen Mother Champion Chase, the championship race for two-mile chasers. He reappeared in a handicap at Cheltenham in December, carrying top weight of 11 stone (st) 13 lb and starting at 6/1, which indicated that he was being set a stiff task on his first outing of the season. Pearlyman won comfortably by seven lengths from French Union, to whom he was conceding 17 lb. He next lined up in the Castleford Chase at Wetherby over the Christmas period. Carrying 12 st 3 lb, he unseated Paul Barton at an early stage of the race. Connections then decided to run Pearlyman at Cheltenham on New Year's Eve in a similar event where he failed to jump fluently and finished a disappointing last of the six runners behind Townley Stone. Pearlyman returned to his best when next seen in the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury in February. With top weight again, and with Peter Scudamore given the mount, Pearlyman came away from his rivals in the later stages of the race to win comfortably from Townley Stone and Little Bay. The Timeform organisation described the performance as the best performance in a two-mile handicap chase of the past few seasons.Chasers & Hurdlers 1986/87 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd Seven rivals opposed Pearlyman in the 1987 Queen Mother Champion Chase. He went off the 13/8 favourite, followed in the betting by Very Promising and Desert Orchid. Townley Stone and Little Bay were also in the line up. With Scudamore retaining the ride, Pearlyman jumped the final fence marginally ahead of Very Promising with the long time leader Desert Orchid close behind. Very Promising drew level with Pearlyman soon after and a duel ensued up the run in with Pearlyman hitting the front again in the last half furlong and holding on to win by a neck, with Desert Orchid another three lengths away in third. Pearlyman had one more outing which came in a valuable handicap at the Aintree Grand National meeting, where he unseated Scudamore. Pearlyman ended the season with a Timeform rating of 171, and was their champion two mile chaser of the season.  1987/1988 season  Pearlyman ran seven times winning on three occasions, including his second Queen Mother Champion Chase. Peter Scudamore partnered him on his first three starts, and Tom Morgan in the remaining four races. Morgan would partner Pearlyman for the remainder of the horse's career. On his seasonal debut at Devon and Exeter where he failed by two and a half lengths to give 8 lb away to Very Promising, Raceform described his physical appearance as a ‚Äò bit backward ‚Äô.Chaseform Annual Jumping Season 1987/88 Published by Raceform Ltd Pearlyman returned to winning form on his next outing in a handicap at Cheltenham in November, where he beat Baluchi and Karenomore, conceding 35 lb to the runner up. He them reappeared eight days later at Ascot, facing another stiff task under top weight. On this occasion he could only finish third of the five runners, behind Long Engagement and Far Bridge. Pearlyman‚Äôs next outing came over Christmas, when he won the Castleford Chase at Wetherby. With Tom Morgan in the saddle, he led four fences from the finish and came home five lengths clear of Little Bay, conceding 24 lb to his nearest rival, a very useful chaser in his own right. As in the previous season, the Game Spirit Chase was chosen as Pearlyman‚Äôs prep race for Cheltenham. Renewing rivalry with his now established adversary Very Promising, Pearlyman led two fences from home but was passed by Very Promising approaching the final fence, and came home seven lengths adrift of the winner, who was carrying 8 lb less. Eight runners lined up for the 1988 running of the Queen Mother Champion Chase which was run in heavy ground. Pearlyman started the 15/8 favourite ahead of the Irish trained Weather The Storm at 100/30. Then came Very Promising at 4/1, and Desert Orchid and Long Engagement both at 9/1. Pearlyman won the race in conclusive style. The Raceform reporter John Sharratt recorded the following comments; ‚Äò headway 9th, pecked 10th, quickened led last‚Äô. Pearlyman crossed the line five lengths ahead of Desert Orchid, who had led until after the second last, with Very Promising a further length away in third place. Pearlyman made his final appearance of the season in a valuable thirteen runner handicap at Aintree. Under top weight, he finished a below form seventh. Timeform awarded Pearlyman a rating of 174 for the season, and were of the opinion that he was, \\"one of the best winners of the Queen Mother Champion Chase in the thirty year history of the race\\".Chasers & Hurdlers 1987/88 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1989/1990 season  Now a ten year old, Pearlyman returned to the track in the Castleford Chase at Wetherby in December 1989. He had missed the whole of the 1988/1989 season due to tendon problems. In a field of five he made a highly encouraging return, the Racing Post close up comments for the run stating, \\"held up, headway on bit 5th, slight lead two out, headed last, not quicken\\". He finished a close third to Ida‚Äôs Delight and Nohalmdun, only a length away from the winner and conceding a significant amount of weight to the first two home. Pearlyman was next seen in the Victor Chandler Chase at Ascot in January. Under top weight, he finished a never nearer fifth to Meikleour. Pearlyman's next appearance in the 1990 Queen Mother Champion Chase would be the last time he was seen on a racecourse. In a field of nine he started the 6/1 third favourite behind Barnbrook Again and Sabin Du Loir. There was a period during the race when Pearlyman looked the possible winner. In the opinion of Timeform, \\"he had improved his place steadily from halfway and could be seen travelling strongly in a close fourth\\".Chasers & Hurdlers 1989/90 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd However, Pearlyman then hit the third last fence and was pulled up straight away. It was discovered he had disturbed a previous foreleg injury and was retired. He had worn bandages on his forelegs in all of this three starts during this season. Pearlyman ended the season with a Timeform rating of 163.  Retirement  Pearlyman developed sinus problems during his retirement and was put down in 1996 at the age of seventeen.

History  The Sexual Harassment in Higher Education (SHHE) Conference, the first UK university conference on staff-to- student sexual harassment, was held at Goldsmiths in December 2015. The conference prompted the organisers, who had spent ¬£1752 on the event, to create a national organisation to identify and address the sexual misconduct of staff within UK universities. The 1752 Group was established in 2016. The Guardian newspaper have been strong supporters of the group.  Key people  The 1752 Group was co-founded by several academics with experience in student unions, organisational change, consultancy and grassroots activism. These include: * Dr. Anna Bull, a lecturer in sociology at the University of Portsmouth * Dr. Emma Chapman, Royal Astronomical Society Research Fellow, Imperial College London * Heidi Hasbrouch, Associate Director of Qualitative Research at Kantar Public * Dr. Tiffany Page, lecturer in sociology at the University of Cambridge * Dr. Chryssa Sdrolia, Deputy Curriculum Leader for KS5 English Members of the 1752 Group have given several interviews discussing their priorities. Speaking to the LSE, Dr Page emphasised the need to research and action \\"it's critical to situate this as being about equal access to education, which comes under the Equality Act 2010 and under institutional responsibilities. Universities need to safeguard and protect their students, but also ensure that they have equal access to resources. Staff sexual misconduct can lead to students interrupting or dropping out of their studies, or having to avoid any situation where they have to be in the same space as that staff member, which affects their studies and access in multiple ways\\". Dr Anna Bull is running a HEFCE funded project examining university policies, involving focus groups who have experienced staff sexual misconduct. In 2020, The 1752 Group and Ann Olivarius's law firm, McAllister Olivarius,released a report, \\"Sector Guidance to Address Staff Sexual Misconduct in UK Higher Education.\\"  Research  Sexual misconduct by academic staff is under researched worldwide, and was last researched in the UK in 1998. The 1752 Group are committed to developing research on sexual misconduct in higher education, and implementing UK-wide policy to protect students. Their strategic priorities include: * Implementing a national code of conduct that clarifies professional boundaries * Develop a reporting process for sexual misconduct * Establish an independent national office for sexual misconduct advocacy and support * Ensure all institutions record data and make publicly available reports on all allegations * Address the long-term impact of staff sexual misconduct on those who experience it * Implement comprehensive sector- wide and institution-level cultural change In 2011, the NUS' Women's Campaign published Hidden Marks, which found \\"students who had been subjected to a less serious sexual assault were least likely (< 2 %) to report either to the police or to the institution\\". The 1752 Group partnered with the National Union of Students to launch the first UK survey into staff sexual misconduct in higher education. The report was published in April 2018. It found that a third of universities have no policy on staff-student relationships, and as a result, less than 10% of students who experienced sexual harassment report the behaviour to their institutions.

Biography Harry Schachter was born in Vienna, Austria in 1933, to Miriam Freund, a businesswoman, and to Ulrich (Usher) Schachter, a dentist and medical doctor. Harry's father was the cousin of Austro-Hungarian and Romanian tenor and actor, Joseph Schmidt. The Schachter family fled the Nazis in 1938, escaping to Port of Spain, Trinidad. He attended secondary school at Saint Mary's College, placing first in Trinidad in the Cambridge Advanced Level Examinations, and winning the Jerningham Gold Medal and the Island Scholarship in Mathematics. He also worked part-time as a reporter for the local Guardian newspaper. His family immigrated to Toronto, Canada in 1951.  Education and career  At the University of Toronto, Schachter completed his BA in Physiology and Biochemistry in 1955, his MD in 1959, and his PhD in Biochemistry (Gordon Dixon, supervisor) in 1964. Upon completion of his PhD he was appointed an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry. He did his post-doctoral work in glycobiology with Saul Roseman at Johns Hopkins University from 1966 to 1968. He returned to the University of Toronto in 1968, where he established his lab in the Department of Biochemistry. In 1976, Schachter took a position in the Division of Biochemistry Research at the Hospital for Sick Children, which he headed for 13 years. From 1984 to 1989 he also chaired the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Toronto.Marian Packham. Biochemistry at the University of Toronto - A Short History. His contributions to the field of carbohydrate biochemistry include the discovery and characterization of 12 glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of N- and O-linked glycans, thereby defining processes crucial for the formation of branched oligosaccharides on glycoproteins that include cell surface receptors and secreted proteins. Schachter also helped characterize the first Carbohydrate-Deficient Glycoprotein Syndrome (CDG-IIa; now known as Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation). He helped show that GnTII null mice are excellent models for human CDG-IIa. Other work on mice involving null mutations in GnTI, GnTII and GnTIII established the importance of N-glycans in metazoan development. Additionally, Schachter explored the biological functions of complex carbohydrates in Drosophila brain development that demonstrated a tissue-specific role in the regulation of insulin signaling and life span. His translational/clinical work also included enzymatic discoveries in the complex muscle-eye-brain diseases (e.g. congenital muscular dystrophy) associated with defective O-glycosylation. He has published over 160 scientific papers, reviews, and commentaries. Schachter served as post doc supervisor and mentor to scientists in his lab, and collaborated with these and other scientists in Canada, Europe, Japan and the USA.

He entered the Indian Civil Service in 1873, and arrived in India in November 1875 to take up the position of assistant commissioner and settlement officer in Punjab Province, where he stayed for most of his career in India. He officiated as under secretary to the government of Punjab in 1881 and 1884, and as senior financial secretary to the financial commissioned in 1885 and 1886. Appointed deputy commissioner in September 1890, he served as settlement commissioner from November 1899.

It was in this post that he conceived the idea of the Triple Canal Irrigation project, which he lived to see adding enormously to the economic wealth of the province. He retired from the Indian Civil Service in late 1910. In January 1900 he was appointed a Member of the Council of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, staying as such until 1910. Following his return to the United Kingdom, he was Superintending Inspector under the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1911 until 1915, and served as the permanent delegate for the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa to the International Institute of Agriculture in Rome from 1914 until 1917. He regularly communicated statistics on cereal crops in the world to The Times.

Appearance and anatomy  Bursovaginoids are rather small, ranging from a half of a millimeter to a full millimeter in length. Many species in the order Bursovaginoidea have a narrow neck, making their head stand out more than other bursovagionoids and all filospermoids. Bursovaginoids, unlike filospermoids, have paired sensory organs and a penis.Barnes, R.F.K. et al. (2001). The Invertebrates: A Synthesis. Oxford: Blackwell Science.

They were designed by the Cairns City Council and built from 1953 to 1958. They were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 August 2017 amidst some controversy as their heritage listing would prevent the redevelopment of the site for affordable housing.  History  The Grove Street Pensioners' Cottages were built by Cairns City Council from 1953 to as part of a scheme subsidised by the Queensland Government for providing affordable accommodation for old age pensioners. Located on a reserve in Grove Street in the Cairns suburb of Parramatta Park, the complex comprises eight small timber cottages arranged in a curved layout surrounded by lawns and gardens. They were the first of their type to be built in Cairns and are an important surviving example of a largely intact pensioners' cottages scheme. The city of Cairns in tropical far north Queensland was established in 1876 as a port to service the newly discovered Hodgkinson goldfields, and its first local authority, the Cairns Divisional Board, was established in 1879. Initial progress was slow until the establishment of a local sugar industry and the opening up of the Atherton Tableland's mineral fields in the early 1880s. Early industries in the region, such as sugar farming and timber harvesting, created a demand for improved transport facilities to the harbour. In 1885 Cairns was constituted a municipality, and the announcement that Cairns was to be the terminus for the Herberton railway established the town as the principal port in the region.'Cairns,' Queensland Places, Centre for the Government of Queensland at the University of Queensland, <> (accessed 2014)\\"Cairns Regional Council,\\" Queensland Places, Centre for the Government of Queensland at the University of Queensland, <> (accessed 2014)\\"Cairns Divisional Board\\", Queensland State Archives Agency ID2090\\"Cairns Municipal Council\\", Queensland State Archives Agency ID89. Progress and growth continued in the early 20th century. The Cairns Municipal Council became the Cairns Town Council on 31 March 1903, which in turn became the Cairns City Council on 13 October 1923. By this stage the population had reached 8000. This rose to 12,000 by 1933, and 15,700 by 1941. After the disruption of World War II, post-war optimism and prosperity saw development increase and the population grow to 21,018 by June 1954. Of this number, 2099 Cairns residents, (approximately 10% of the population) were aged 60 and over.'Cairns,' Queensland Places, <> (accessed 2014)\\"Cairns Regional Council,\\" Queensland Places,<> (accessed 2014)QHR 601576 Cairns City Council Chambers\\"Cairns Town Council\\", Queensland State Archives Agency ID90\\"Cairns City Council\\", Queensland State Archives Agency ID58Census of the Commonwealth of Australia 30 June 1954, Vol III Part 1 - Analysis of Population in Local Government Areas Etc. Queensland's social fabric is supported by a network of social security and welfare services provided by the Queensland and Australian Governments and voluntary organisations to disadvantaged persons. Until the late-19th century, however, no such government aid existed in Queensland, with most of the responsibility for providing relief falling upon voluntary organisations. In the 1890s, the Queensland Government provided residential institutions and subsidies to voluntary organisations in aid of orphans, the mentally ill, the destitute, the aged, and the infirm. The Dunwich Benevolent Asylum on North Stradbroke Island (established 1866, closed 1945), operated with minimal services and at times could not meet demand for admission. Factors such as increased longevity and the 1890s economic depression saw many families unable to care for aged relatives, and with the system of private charity proving inadequate, the Queensland Government was forced to act.'Queensland Past and Present: 100 Years of Statistics, 1896-1996,' Government Statistician's Office, Queensland Government, Brisbane, 1998, pp.277-309Thom Blake, \\"Health buildings in Queensland: an historical overview\\", Asset Management Unit, Capital Works and Assessment Management Branch, Queensland Health, 1997, p.62 In 1907 Queensland implemented a system of non-contributory age pensions, followed shortly after by the Australian Government, which provided a national system in 1909. The intention of the pension scheme was to provide relief for the aged poor that did not involve the stigma associated with charitable aid, or take away individuals' freedom. The age pension was initially 10 shillings a week, available to males and females aged 65 years and over (lowered to 60 years for females in 1910) and to persons aged 60‚Äì64 who were permanently incapacitated for work. It was subject to a character and residence test with limitations imposed on income and property.'Queensland Past and Present: 100 Years of Statistics, 1896-1996,' 1998, pp.277-309Andrew Herscovitch and David Stanton, \\"History of social security in Australia\\", Family Matters, 2008, no.80, pp.51-60 The site of the Grove Street Pensioners' Cottages in the Cairns suburb of Parramatta Park has a long history of accommodating poor and aged Cairns residents. It was originally part of a railway reserve, with the first stage of the Cairns railway line (constructed 1886-87) running through it. The railway line was deviated in 1910-11 to its present position on the north- eastern side of Lily Creek, and over the following decades negotiations and disagreements about how to use the former railway land (known as the Martyn Street reserve) took place between Cairns City Council and the Queensland Government.Survey Plan C19839, 1888Cairns Post, Saturday 3 Dec 1910, p.5Cairns Post, Friday 25 February 1927, p.8Cairns Post, Wednesday 25 June 1947, p.5. In 1921 part of the Martyn Street reserve, south of Grove Street, was allocated as a site for old age pensioners to reside.Cairns Post, Wednesday 26 January 1921, p.2Cairns Post, Saturday 27 November 1926, p.8article describes the location of this pensioners' reserve area as opposite Section 52, which places it south of Grove Street, opposite the current pensioners' cottages siteCairns Post, Wednesday 22 September 1920, p.3. Pensioners' reserves, where old age pensioners unable to afford other forms of accommodation could build themselves a hut or shelter to live in, existed in many Queensland towns and some suburbs of Brisbane in the early 20th century. Administered by the local authorities, who issued permits to pensioners wishing to reside there, it was a cheap but ultimately inadequate way of housing the poorest members of the community. Self-built huts were not connected to water or electricity and were vulnerable to bad weather and being destroyed by fire. Several pensioners' reserves existed at different times in Cairns, including one at Bungalow.For example, Tarragindi pensioners' reserve, in Brisbane - Courier Mail Thursday 22 January 1953 p.3Charleville pensioners' reserve - Charleville Times Friday 17 February 1933, p.7Cairns Post, Thursday 24 October 1940, p.4Charleville Times Friday 30 December 1938, p.5Cairns Post, Wednesday 22 October 1919, p.8Cairns Post, Wednesday 8 May 1946, p.4. A proposal to provide better accommodation for Cairns pensioners was considered by Cairns City Council in September 1926, when the Works Committee recommended that three cottages be erected by the council, to be let at a nominal rental to approved local pensioners. An article in The Cairns Post on 27 November 1926 stated that the council had approved the scheme, however whether or not these cottages were constructed is unclear, as shortly afterwards the pensioners were relocated further north within the Martyn Street reserve, to an area on the southern side of Charles Street. By September 1928 this area had been partly fenced and a water source provided. It was here that the pensioners established themselves, living in tents and small self-built huts.Cairns Post, Thursday 23 September 1926, p.14Cairns Post, Wednesday 19 September 1928, p.7Cairns Post, Thursday 21 August 1947, p.4Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNRM) aerial QAP81-108, 1949. Between 1910 and 1950 the number of old age pensioners in Queensland rose from 8,561 to 45,937. As the population grew and the pension rate failed to keep pace with rising costs of living, pensioners found it increasingly difficult to afford decent accommodation. A Courier Mail article printed in June 1950 summed up the housing plight faced by hundreds of pensioners living a \\"hand to mouth\\" existence, with a lack of proper accommodation forcing many of them to live in small rooms with inadequate facilities. Homes for the aged were too few to handle the number of pensioners seeking accommodation, with at least 1000 waiting for admission to homes in the Brisbane area alone.Townsville Daily Bulletin, Wednesday 19 February 1947, p.5Courier Mail, Saturday 10 June 1950, p.3. From the 1920s the Queensland Government had established institutions for the aged, infirm and/or destitute in different parts of the state. The first purpose-built government home for the aged, named \\"Eventide\\", was opened at Charters Towers in 1929, providing accommodation for 150 inmates. Unlike the Dunwich asylum, which housed inmates in large dormitories, Charters Towers inmates were provided with \\"single and double huts, each having its own small garden plot\\". In 1945, the Dunwich asylum was closed and the inmates transferred to a former Royal Australia Air Force (RAAF) station at Sandgate. Also named \\"Eventide\\", this institution became the principal government aged care facility in southern Queensland. A third \\"Eventide\\" was opened in Rockhampton in 1950, offering similar hut accommodation to Charters Towers, arranged within a complex including hospital wards, a workshop/library, a recreation building and kitchen, dining, bathing and laundry facilities.Thom Blake, \\"Health buildings in Queensland: an historical overview\\", p.62Thom Blake, Michael Kennedy and Margaret Pullar, \\"Queensland Health Heritage Survey, Volume 2: Site Assessments\\", Queensland Health Central Office, 1996, no. CN27 Rockhampton Eventide Home. The alternatives to Government-run institutions were benevolent institutions and homes for the aged run by charities and religious organisations. Early examples were often housed within converted residences, such as at Hanworth Home for the Aged, established in 1913.QHR 601026 Hanworth Home for the Aged. A new type of charitable institution, similar to the Charters Towers \\"Eventide\\", was established in 1936 in the Brisbane suburb of Chermside, due to the combined efforts of Methodist social advocate Reverend Harold Wheller and philanthropist/businessman George Marchant. Chermside Garden Settlement consisted of 20 cottages in a garden setting, with communal dining room and laundry buildings, and grew rapidly to include a chapel, bowling green and a further nine cottages within four years.BCC Heritage Register - H M Wheller Garden SettlementCourier Mail Tuesday 18 February 1936, p.12Courier Mail, Thursday 24 November 1938, p.2\\"Wheller Gardens\\", Chermside and Districts Historical Society Inc. website <> Despite the growing number of facilities available, in the mid-20th century there were still not enough places to accommodate all pensioners in need, and the regulated lifestyle offered by institutions did not appeal to able-bodied pensioners who wished to live independently. To encourage the construction of more affordable housing for pensioners, in 1945 the Queensland Department of Health and Home Affairs implemented a state-wide scheme to assist local authorities with constructing cottages. The scheme offered a pound-for-pound subsidy and, where necessary, made loan money available. The cottages were intended for pensioners who were able to care for themselves and desired to live independently in their local districts. The grant of the subsidy was subject to approval by Cabinet, and it was the responsibility of the local authority to secure the site, prepare plans and erect and maintain the cottages.Queensland Times, Friday 3 August 1945, p.2Daily Mercury, 27 November 1945, p.2The first subsidies were granted to Toowoomba and Bundaberg councils in February 1946, The Courier Mail, 6 February 1946, p.3The Courier Mail, Monday 17 September 1945, p.3. By September 1953, cottages had been built at Innisfail (11 units), Cloncurry (6 cottages), Inglewood (1 cottage), Texas (1 cottage), Warwick (8 cottages), Toowoomba (22 units), Mareeba (10 cottages), Ipswich (12 units), and Mackay (12 cottages under construction).The Courier Mail, Wednesday 2 September 1953, p.10. Other towns known to have carried cottage schemes through to completion include Maryborough, Atherton, Bowen and Blackall.Maryborough - Courier Mail, Wednesday 13 August 1947, p.9Atherton - Townsville Daily Bulletin, Saturday 15 May 1954, p.7Bowen - Townsville Daily Bulletin, Thursday 23 September 1954, p.6Barcaldine - Longreach Leader, Friday 21 May 1954, p.6Blackall - Longreach Leader, Thursday 24 December 1953, p.7. The types of accommodation constructed varied. In Toowoomba, eleven timber United States Army buildings were relocated to West Street and converted into duplex cottages, each housing two couples. This was one of the first schemes completed, with units available from December 1947.The Courier Mail, Wednesday 6 February 1946, p.3The Courier Mail, Friday 7 November 1947, p.3DNRM aerial QAP483-64, 1955. In Innisfail, fibro-clad single and double units, and one four-unit cottage for women only, were built in different locations in the town so that the pensioners would be \\"part of the normal fellowship of suburban life\\". In Mackay, a \\"model settlement\\" of 12 cottages and a communal laundry was designed by architect Karl Langer, built in a low, bungalow style serviced by a winding road.The Northern Miner, Friday 24 September 1948, p.4Townsville Daily Bulletin, Friday 27 February 1953, p.7DNRM aerial QAP906-42, 1959. In Cloncurry, six rectangular, concrete and brick cottages were constructed in a row on the edge of town.The Courier Mail, Monday 27 June 1949, p.5The Courier Mail, Friday 30 March 1951, p.6DNRM aerial QAP1236-116, 1961Pensioners dwellings - bypass road, Cloncurry [picture], National Library of Australia, nla.obj-143203512, 1996. While in Brassall, Ipswich, six double units, with tiled roofs and brick chimneys, were completed in 1953, each unit containing a bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom and verandah.The Courier Mail, Wednesday 2 April 1952, p.7DNRM aerial QAP548-65, 1955. Cottages were let for an affordable rent, and pensioners interested in occupying them made an application to the local authority. Some schemes only permitted all males or all females to reside there, while others provided for mixed groups and married couples. Not all proposed cottages schemes went ahead as planned and local authorities had different views about the concept. In Barcaldine, a scheme to build 6 cottages did not progress due to building costs and the unwillingness of local pensioners to pay rent for them.Central Queensland Herald, Thursday 5 May 1949, p.24. The Bowen Town Council was forced to defer building their \\"model village\\" for years due to delays in obtaining approvals and rapidly rising construction costs, with only three out of six planned cottages eventually built in .Townsville Daily Bulletin Friday 8 January 1954, p.3Townsville Daily Bulletin, Thursday 23 September 1954, p.6DNRM aerial QAP1039-23, 1960. The Townsville City Council stated their opinion that homes for the aged were a better system than pensioners' cottages, and that the Australian Government's Social Service Fund were the proper authority to fulfil the obligation to house pensioners.Townsville Daily Bulletin, Saturday 30 August 1952, p.2Townsville Daily Bulletin, Thursday 4 September 1952, p.2. In Cairns, lobbying on behalf of local pensioners began in 1947, when a branch of the Australian Pensioners' League (APL) was formed in July.Cairns Post, Saturday 5 July 1947, p.7. The League played an important role in improving the living conditions of Queensland pensioners by lobbying local, state and federal governments on issues such as raising the minimum pension rate, abolishing the means test, and improving social benefits. One of the first acts of the Cairns branch of the APL was to request that Cairns City Council have the Martyn Street reserve officially gazetted as a Reserve for Pensioners' Homes, which took place on 4 September 1948. The reserve, of approximately , was bounded by Grove Street to the southeast, Lily Creek to the northeast, Charles Street to the northwest, and private properties to the southwest.\\"Grove Street Pensioner Cottages\\", Cairns Regional Council Heritage Survey 2012, pp.419-421Government Gazette, 4 September 1948, p.1678. The following year, in December 1949, a deputation of the Cairns branches of the APL and the Australian Labor Party requested that Cairns City Council erect cottages for single and married pensioners on the reserve that could be let for a nominal rental. In arguing their case, the deputation pointed out the poor living conditions of the pensioners currently occupying the reserve, and stood up for the rights of Cairns pensioners to stay residing in the area, rather than relocating to a state-run institution in another region. In response, the Mayor of Cairns stated that council had already begun investigating costs and would consider the matter when more information was available.Cairns Post, Wednesday 14 December 1949, p.5The Daily News, Friday 9 September 1949, p.5\\"Grove Street Pensioner Cottages\\", Cairns Regional Council Heritage Survey 2012, pp.419-421. Progress towards constructing the cottages was slow. In mid-1950 a deputation of the Cairns Pensioners' League approached the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Cook, Carlisle Wordsworth, who wrote to the Cairns City Council urging them to take action, saying: \\"These elderly people are living under conditions unworthy of a city the size of Cairns. They are not seeking charity but feel entitled to the provision of huts and lighting on a rental basis. Such facilities have been provided for pensioners at Mareeba.\\" The Mayor, William Henry Murchison, replied that an amount for a cottage scheme had been placed on the council's loan budget, and in December 1950 the council passed a resolution to borrow ¬£1500 for erecting six cottages.Cairns Post, Thursday 20 July 1950, p.2Cairns Post, Wednesday 20 December 1950, p.1 Approval for this loan and the ¬£1500 state government subsidy was granted in February 1951, and the Mayor announced that tenders for erecting the cottages would be called shortly. Plans were prepared and submitted to the Department of Public Works for approval. However, the Department's objections to aspects of the cottage design delayed progress for over a year. A frustrated Cairns Mayor, Bill Fulton, defended the cottage plans, explaining that the designs were based on those of the Anderson Street diggers' homes, which had been found very satisfactory.Cairns Post, Saturday 10 February 1951, p.5Cairns Post, Wednesday 17 September 1952, p.5. The diggers' homes scheme that provided a basis for the pensioners' cottage designs was undertaken by the Cairns and District branch of the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA) in 1937. Built to house \\"burnt-out\\" former soldiers, the scheme comprised six small timber cottages, fully furnished with electricity, water and space for gardens, erected in a row off Anderson Street. The site also included a community hall and a communal bathroom. The scheme was funded by public donations and the land was donated by the Mayor, William Aloysius Collins.Cairns Post, Saturday 30 October 1937, p.6Cairns Post, Monday 20 December 1937, p.6. The Mareeba pensioners' cottages scheme referred to by Wordsworth had been constructed in 1950. Consisting of ten cottages in a row (two for married couples, eight for single occupants) the Mareeba scheme was held up by advocates of the proposed Cairns scheme as a good model to follow.Cairns Post, Friday 16 June 1950, p.6Cairns Post, Wednesday 19 November 1952, p.5DNRM aerial QAP1071-5, 1960. Neither the diggers' homes nor the Mareeba cottages survive today. View northwest along the driveway, 2017 In early 1953, after resolving the various design and loan issues with the Queensland Government, Cairns City Council commenced work on the Grove Street cottages. The approved plans and specifications, dated October 1952, were for small, individual cottages containing two rooms - a kitchen and bedroom - each , as well as a stove recess and an front verandah. They were to be timber-framed, clad in chamferboards with a gable roof clad in corrugated asbestos cement sheeting. Standing on low concrete stumps, access was to be via front and rear timber stairs. Internally, floors were to be of hardwood, walls and partitions lined with plywood, and the ceilings and stove recesses lined with fibrous cement sheeting. Joinery consisted of framed, ledged and braced timber doors, timber casement windows with \\"obscured fancy glass\\", and glass louvres to the stove recesses. The cottages were to be laid out in a crescent formation, with plenty of space for gardens at the front and rear. Two earth closets and a laundry/shower block were to be located behind the cottages.Cairns Post, Thursday 5 March 1953, p.5Queensland State Archives Item ID 664238 \\"Specifications and plans for pensioners cottages, Grove St.\\", 29/9/1952 - 2/4/1954. The site for the cottages was facing Grove Street at the southern end of the pensioners' reserve, away from the existing pensioners' huts. Construction of the cottages took place in stages, with the first cottage (the centre cottage today), one laundry block and one earth closet completed by November 1953. In April 1954, a contract to construct four cottages (two each on either side of the existing cottage) and one earth closet was signed by contractor L Davey and the work was likely undertaken in late 1954. In September 1954, Cairns City Council announced its intention to borrow an additional ¬£500 to defray the cost of erecting the pensioners' cottages.Queensland State Archives Item ID 664238 \\"Specifications and plans for pensioners cottages, Grove St.\\", 29/9/1952 - 2/4/1954Reserve File 7982, R967 Reserve for Local Government (Pensioners' Homes)DNRM aerial ADA544-64, 1952Cairns Post, Wednesday 16 September 1953, p.4Cairns Post, Friday 18 September 1953, p.2Committee Minute Books, Cairns City Council, Report from City Engineer (F R Morris), 17 November 1953Council Minute Books, Cairns City Council, Special Meeting, Monday 2 August 1954Cairns Post, Saturday 25 September 1954, p.5 Aerial photographs show the remaining three cottages (one at either end of the crescent and one set behind at the southwest end) and laundry building at Grove Street were built after May 1957, concurrent with a second pensioners' cottages scheme being constructed in Cairns for women and married couples, located in Pease Street. The Pease Street site was first investigated by council in early 1954, and construction of the first stage of pensioners' cottages commenced there in late 1956. Cairns City Council meeting minute books from 1955 to 1958 refer to applications for additional loans (with matching subsidies from the state government) and the use of day labour to erect pensioner cottages, but there is no distinction made between the two sites. The Grove Street site was likely completed in 1958, comprising a total of eight cottages, seven of which were arranged in a crescent and linked by a curved driveway, two laundry buildings, and two earth closets. The Pease Street site grew to comprise 15 cottages, arranged in two straight rows, and an unknown number of outbuildings.DNRM aerials QAP712-5, 1957QAP992-11, 1959QAP1774-49, 1965The Pease Street reserve is located on Lot 2, Crown Plan C198239Cairns Post, Wednesday 20 January 1954, p.5Cairns Post, Thursday 17 June 1954, p.5Council Minute Books, Cairns City Council, Ordinary Meeting, Tuesday 18 December 1956Special Meeting, Wednesday 28 September 1955Loan Fund - General, 1955/56Loan Fund - General, 1956/57Meeting of the Council as a Committee of the Whole, Friday 8 November 1957Ordinary Meeting, Tuesday 21 January 1958Ordinary meeting, Tuesday 18 March 1958. As the first pensioners' cottages to be built in Cairns, the Grove Street cottages set the pattern for further pensioner housing to be built in the region. The cottages constructed in Pease Street followed the same plan, with a larger version for married couples. In 1954, Mulgrave Shire Council invited tenders for a single pensioners' cottage each at Yorkeys Knob, Gordonvale, Babinda and Bramston Beach, with the design to be similar to those being erected in Cairns. Mulgrave Shire Council went on to tender for construction of cottages at Machans Beach and Edmonton in 1957. None of the Mulgrave Shire cottages survive today.DNRM aerial QAP1774-49, 1965Mulgrave Shire merged with Cairns City in 1995, \\"Mulgrave Shire,\\" Queensland Places, <> (accessed 2017)Cairns Post, Saturday 23 October 1954, p.10Council Minute Books, Mulgrave Shire Council, Regular Meeting, 20 September 1954Regular Meeting, 15 August 1955Regular Meeting 20 February 1956Regular Meeting 21 January 1957;egular Meeting 18 March 1957DNRM aerials QAP712-48, 1957 (Gordonvale)QAP713-78, 1957 (Babinda)QAP1317-475, 1962 (Machans Beach)QAP1317-492, 1962 (Yorkeys Knob)QAP1414-32, 1964 (Bramston Beach)QAP1528-101, 1965 (Edmonton). Accommodation at the Grove Street reserve was increased substantially during the 1970s and 80s, when the remainder of the reserve land between Grove and Charles streets was subdivided and developed in stages by the Queensland Housing Commission. These developments took the form of long blocks of single storey units in a garden setting.DNRM aerials QAP3470-2552, 1977QAP3071-889, 1979QAP4091-6831, 1982QAP4681-39, 1990Survey plans NR5772, 1973NR5822, 1973NR6348, 1977NR6614, 1979NR6641, 1979. The gardens surrounding the Grove Street pensioners' cottages varied in use and layout over the decades, and by the 1970s included clusters of large trees at the western end of the site. In 1989 Cairns City Council added a plaque to the front gardens in line with cottage 4 (the centre cottage), dedicated to former resident Keron Glendon, who \\"established this garden and caringly tended it for 14 years\\". In 2017, surviving trees and shrubs from Glendon's garden remain near the plaque.DNRM aerials QAP992-11, 1959, QAP3470-2552, 1977, QAP4185-47, 1983 and QAP4681-39, 1990Plaque inscription reads 'In appreciation of the work of K. P. (King) Glendon who established this garden and caringly tended it for 14 years. Cairns City Council, 1989.'Electoral roll (1980) and telephone directory information about K P Glendon provided by Cairns Libraries. Site plan for the cottages Of the many pensioners' cottages schemes built in Queensland in the 1940s and 50s, most have been demolished or replaced by more modern accommodation. Known surviving schemes include: Toowoomba (9 out of 11 duplex cottages), Brassall, Ipswich (original 6 duplex units), Blackall (original 4 cottages), Warwick (original 4 single and 2 duplex cottages), Atherton (original 2 cottages), Pease Street, Cairns (7 out of 15 cottages - 3 single cottages, 4 married couples' cottages, some relocated on site) and Grove Street, Cairns (original 8 single cottages).Google Earth and Google Streetview (accessed 2014, 2017) were used to confirm existence of known cottages schemes today, with reference to historical aerial photographs. The Grove Street cottages remain in their original layout surrounded by gardens and mature trees, and have undergone some alterations and additions over the decades. In the 1980s a bathroom extension was added to the rear of the bedroom of each cottage, and the front verandahs were enclosed. The laundry/shower blocks were subsequently used for storage, and have recently been demolished. All cottages had their roof sheeting replaced by 1990 and the exterior walls have been covered with vinyl panels replicating timber boards. Other additions include roof ventilators and security screens. In 2017, most of the Grove Street Pensioners' Cottages continue to be occupied by elderly pensioners and the site remains under the trusteeship of Cairns Regional Council.DNRM aerials QAP4185-47, 1983DIG7037-44233, 2011Google Earth (accessed 2017)DNRM Certificate of Title 49005784, 1948. The heritage listing in August 2017 was controversial as the Cairns Regional Council had proposed to redevelop the site with 20 to 30 modern affordable dwellings with better mobility access. Following the nomination for heritage listing, the council suggested that two of the cottages should be relocated and refurbished for the purposes of heritage listing, arguing they had outlived their usefulness as public housing. Critics of the 1950s cottages described them as \\"asbestos ridden\\" \\"huts\\" and did not think they were worthy of heritage listing as \\"they're pretty bloody ordinary\\". However, the final decision was to list all 8 of the cottages in situ.  Description  Front view of cottages 1 and 2, 2017 The Grove Street Pensioners' Cottages occupy a southeast-facing site on Grove Street in the Cairns suburb of Parramatta Park. Seven individual cottages are arranged in a crescent addressing Grove Street, linked by a curved driveway, while an eighth cottage stands alone in the western corner of the site. Residential development surrounds the site to the southwest and northwest, largely screened from view by trees, and Lily Creek lies to the northeast. Driveways accessing properties to the rear of the site adjoin the northeast and southwest boundaries. Rear view of cottages 4 and 5, 2017 From the exterior, the cottages appear almost identical. Small in scale, they are single storey, timber-framed buildings on low concrete stumps. Each has a gable roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting with raked eaves. The walls and eaves are clad in pre-painted vinyl panels replicating timber boards. Original windows are timber-framed, three-light casements of patterned glass, and louvres to the stove recess. The front verandahs have been enclosed with louvres above balustrade height. A short flight of steps to the front door has a modern metal handrail, while the rear steps retain their timber balustrade. Non-significant elements of the exterior include: louvre windows to the verandah enclosure and rear bathroom addition, roof ventilators, security screens to doors and windows, vinyl cladding, and metal handrails. The interior of each cottage contains four rooms - an enclosed front verandah, a kitchen with original stove recess, a bedroom, and a bathroom extension. All have been renovated at different times and contain a variety of linings, fittings and fixtures. Surviving early fabric includes: framed and ledged timber board doors, early locks and door handles, kitchen cabinets, chamfered architraves, and flat wall and ceiling linings with cover strips. Non- significant elements of the interior include: ceiling fans and lights, bathroom fit-outs, and modern shelving and cabinets. Rear gardens, 2017 The cottages are surrounded by lawns and garden beds with mature trees (including mango trees) lining the rear boundary. Garden beds adjacent to each cottage vary in layout and extent, and the site contains a wide variety of tree and plant species. The western end of the site is characterised by dense clusters of vegetation and mature trees, including a large fig tree to the north of Cottage 8. In the centre of the front gardens are trees and shrubs remaining from an earlier garden layout and a 1989 plaque laid by Cairns City Council in appreciation of the work of KP (King) Glendon in establishing and tending the garden for 14 years. A curved bitumen driveway links the cottages along their south-eastern side, following the path of an earlier unsealed driveway. Fencing enclosing the site is not of heritage significance. The identical cottages in their curved layout and garden setting are an attractive feature of the Grove Street streetscape.  Heritage listing  Grove Street Pensioners' Cottages was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 August 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Grove Street Pensioners' Cottages, constructed from 1953 to , are important in demonstrating the widespread movement to provide affordable housing for old aged pensioners in the 1940s-50s in Queensland. Pensioners' Cottages schemes, which were built by local authorities with the aid of a State Government subsidy offered from 1945, were an important social welfare initiative that allowed pensioners to lead independent lives in their local districts, and were an alternative to aged care homes and institutions. The Grove Street cottages were the first of their type to be built in Cairns and are important surviving evidence of a largely intact pensioners' cottages scheme. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Grove Street Pensioners' Cottages are an excellent and largely intact example of a pensioners' cottage scheme, and are important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of this type of affordable, independent accommodation constructed for aged pensioners in the 1940s and 50s. This class of place comprises multiple, small, single or duplex residences of few rooms, of similar or identical appearance and with a simple plan form, arranged on a single site with open space for gardens, and often including communal laundry and/or bathroom facilities. The Grove Street site retains its original layout of eight single cottages in a spacious garden setting, connected by a curved driveway. The cottages retain their identical external appearance, original form and plan layout, and most original joinery and materials, with some alterations and additions over time.

Discovered in 2014 by the Kepler Space Telescope, Kepler-277b is a sub-Neptune sized exoplanet with a very high mass and density for an object of its radius, suggesting a composition made mainly of rock and iron. Along with its sister planet, Kepler-277c, the planet's mass was determined using transit-timing variations (TTVs).  Characteristics = Size and temperature = Kepler-277b was detected using the transit method and TTVs, allowing for both its mass and radius to be determined to some level. It is approximately 2.92 , between the size of Earth and Neptune. At that radius, most planets should be gaseous Mini-Neptunes with no solid surface. However, the mass of Kepler-277b is extremely high for its size. Transit-timing variations indicate a planetary mass of about 87.3 , comparable to Saturn's mass at 95.16 . The planet has a density of approximately 19.3 g/cm3 and about 10.4 times the surface gravity of Earth.

Due to its proximity to its host star, Kepler-277b is quite hot with an equilibrium temperature of about , hot enough to melt certain metals.  Internal structure and composition  Models of Kepler-277b's internal structure suggest that it has a very large iron core with an estimated radius of 2.435 . The core predominantly consists of an allotrope of iron with a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystalline structure. At the innermost region of Kepler-277b's core where pressures reach as high as 37.52 terapascals, iron exists in a body-centered-tetragonal (BCT) and body-centered cubic (BCC) crystalline structure. Kepler-277b has a relatively thin silicate mantle in comparison to its core. The mantle of Kepler-277b is thought be predominantly composed of ultrahigh-pressure phases of magnesium silicates (MgSiO3). The uppermost mantle of Kepler-277b is thought to consist of olivine, wadsleyite, and ringwoodite while the lower part of Kepler-277b's upper mantle consists of silicate perovskite and post-perovskite. = Orbit = Kepler-277b orbits close to its host star, with one orbit lasting 17.324 days. Its semi-major axis, or average distance from the parent object, is about 0.136 AU. For comparison, the planet Mercury in our Solar System takes 88 days to orbit at a distance of 0.38 AU. At this distance, Kepler-277b is very hot and most likely tidally locked to its host star. It is close to a 2:1 resonance with Kepler-277c. = Host star = The parent star Kepler-277 is a large yellow star. It is 1.69 and 1.12 , with a temperature of 5946 K, a metallicity of -0.315 [Fe/H], and an unknown age. For comparison, the Sun has a temperature of 5778 K, a metallicity of 0.00 [Fe/H], and an age of about 4.5 billion years. The large radius in comparison to its mass and temperature suggest that Kepler-277 could be a Subgiant star.

Adrian Knup returned to the club, signed in after a short spell by Galatasaray, Gaetano Giallanza and Jean-Pierre La Placa, signed in from Sion, Mario Frick came from St. Gallen and Adrian Falub came from Universitatea Cluj. In the other direction Ike Shorunmu transferred to Z√ºrich, Mario Cantaluppi to Servette and Gabriel Okolosi to Young Boys. Further players who left the club were Marco Walker, Andre Meier and Lars Olsen. The season did not start too well, it took until the twelfth round until the team recorded their second victory. As the first half of the season came to an end, Basel were in eighth position in the league table. Therefore, they qualified for the Championship round. They had gathered five victories, ten draws and had suffered seven defeats. The team scored 32 goals and conceded 33. Gaetano Giallanza was the team's top scorer with eleven goals. During the winter break Markus Schupp was in on loan from Hamburger SV, Franco Foda signed in from VfB Stuttgart and Fabrice Henry signed in from CD Toledo. Also during the winter break Admir Smajiƒá transferred to Young Boys. In the Championship round the team suffered nine defeats, winning only three games and so they ended the season in the bottom position in the league table. The team scored 16 goals and conceded 28. Gaetano Giallanza was the team's top scorer, he had netted eight times. In the Swiss Cup the opponent in the round of 64 was lower tier FC M√ºnsingen. Basel won the match in extra time. In the round of 32 Basel hosted the game against Young Boys and won 2‚Äì1. Oumar Kond√© and Jean-Pierre La Placa each scored a goal and turned the game, after the team had been a goal behind early in the match. In the round of 16 Basel hosted Servette but they were knocked out, losing 1‚Äì4. In the 1996 UEFA Intertoto Cup Basel played in group 7 together with Rotor Volgograd, Antalyaspor, Shakhtar Donetsk and Ataka-Aura Minsk. Basel ended the competition as second-placed team in the group league table.  Players  The following is the list of the Basel first team squad.

Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003 He had two brothers, Captain Noel Edward Vere Fitz-Patrick (b. 1908) and Denys Bryan (b. 1911). His father was the son of Randall Skeffington Smyth and the Hon. Gertrude Fitz-Patrick, daughter of the 1st Lord Castletown. At the death of Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown, Colonel Skeffington Smyth took the name and Arms of Fitz-Patrick by deed poll. Terence Skeffington-Smyth did not work and lived off a large inheritance from his mother, Violet Frances Monckton-Arundell. He divided his time between England and the French Riviera. While in London, he lived at 19 Orchard Street, near Selfridges, but often stayed also at the International Sports Club in Upper Grosvenor Street. He met his close friend Elvira Mullens Barney in August 1931; at the trial he said \\"I have seen quite a lot of Mrs. Barney since then. I know her very well indeed, she is a very good friend of mine.\\" Skeffington- Smyth held a cocktail party on 26 June 1932, and most of the invitations to Barney's dinner party of 30 May were made that night, therefore this is the reason why most of guests at Barney's house seemed to be better acquaintanced with Skeffington-Smyth than Barney. Skeffington-Smythe was not at the dinner party since he was in Paris, and arriving at 7pm joined the group at The Blue Angel before going together to Arthur Jeffress‚Äô home. After Barney shot Michael Scott Stephen, she called Skeffington-Smyth. She asked him to come over as \\"something terrible has happened,\\" but he said he could not go. On 19 December 1934 at St. Margaret's Church Westminster, Terence Skeffington-Smyth married Isobel McLean, the eldest daughter of Loudon McLean. He died during a world cruise on 9 March 1936. He was staying at the Broadway Mansions Hotel in Shanghai and The Straits Times reported that he died after visiting an opium dens. The Papers of the Monckton-Arundell Family, Viscounts Galway of Serlby Hall, Nottinghamshire, early 13th Century - 1958, at the Nottingham University Library, Department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, include a poem of Terence Skeffington Smyth.

Univ.-Prof\\" 1986, \\"O. Univ.-Prof.\\" 1992 University of Vienna) is Professor and Chair Emeritus for English Historical Linguistics at the Department of English and American Studies at the University of Vienna. He has been the fourth \\"Luick\\"-Chair and a major proponent of the Vienna School of English Historical Linguisitics (a positionr that since Schendl's retirement in 2007 has been held by Nikolaus Ritt as the fifth such chair). Schendl's work spans from Old English to Late Modern English, though his interests include present-day varieties and, not insignificantly, Austrian German (a passion he shares with Karl Luick). He r incorporates sociohistorical approaches, e.g. Schendl (1996, 1997, 2012). Presently, Schendl is teaching courses on Old English at the Department of English and American Studies in Vienna. Schendl is perhaps most widely known as an innovator in the area of historical code-switching, an area he helped found and brought to prominence from the mid-1990s. His most popular monograph is his introductory book Historical Linguistics, which appeared in 2001 in Oxford University Press' series Oxford Introductions to Language Studies, edited by H. G. Widdowson, and has been translated into a number of languages, and has appeared in China with a Chinese foreword.  Education and Academic Career  Herbert Schendl grew up, like Herbert Penzl, in Upper Austria and studied English and French Literature and Linguistics at the University of Vienna, originally towards a teachers' degree. In 1971-74 he worked as an Assistant Professor at what is now the Vienna University of Economics and Business, before, in 1974, returning to his Alma Mater Department as Assistant Professor. His \\"Habilitation\\" (second book) on verb valency in Old English was completed in 1985, followed by professorial positions in Vienna and, in 1992, a call as Full Professor to the University of Munich, which he declined, deciding to remain as Ordinarius at the University of Vienna.  Academic philosophy and record  Schendl has been a member of the University Board of Governors (\\"Senat\\" in Austrian German), as the Dean's Committee Chair or as a member of the university-wide Arbitration Committee. His efforts have been recognized in a 2007 Festschrift on the occasion of his 65th birthday published by Braum√ºller, and a 2012 international symposium on the occasion of his 70th birthday (see Conferences).  Austrian Studies in English  Herbert Schendl has been editor of Austrian Studies in English (ASE), currently with Sabine Coelsch-Foisner and Gabriella Mazzon. ASE is a book series originally founded in 1895 as Wiener Beitr√§ge zur englischen Philologie and is one of the longest-running academic publication series in the world. Austrian Studies has been a major vehicle of publication for the Vienna School, publishing works by Jakob Schipper (1895), Karl Luick (1903), or Herbert Koziol (1967). Jakob Schipper, as the founding Professor of the Vienna English Department in 1877, was also the series' first main editor. Over 105 volumes have appeared in the series, which has been published with Peter Lang since 2014.  Conferences  In February 2012, the symposium \\"Studying Change in the History of English: New Directions in Linguistics\\" (SCHENDL) was held at the Department of English and American Studies at the University of Vienna (co-organised by the School of English at Birmingham City University). On February 24-25, several national and international scholars presented their research on historical English linguistics in honour of Herbert Schendl.

He was selected by British Westinghouse for training as one of the 'Holy Forty' who would train with its American parent company before taking up junior posts at the British Westinghouse works in Trafford Park, Manchester. Fleming spent the years from 1899 to 1902 with Westinghouse Electric Company at its East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania works before returning to take up a post in Trafford Park. He became an insulation specialist and then the Chief Transformer Designer. Fleming introducing a training programme for apprentice recruits, first in the transformer department and then in 1908 throughout British Westinghouse. British Westinghouse created in 1913 a separate transformer department with Fleming as Superintendent and Chief Engineer, sponsored in 1914 a corporate trade apprentice school directed by him, and in 1917 made him Manager of the corporate education department. During WW I, Fleming lead a research team which made important progress in electrical technology for detecting submarines. In 1919 British Westinghouse was merged into Metropolitan-Vickers.

As the programme developed during the following decade, the United Nations General Assembly began requesting information from UNESCO about its progress. The General Assembly then declared the Year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace and requested UNESCO to submit a draft Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, which the General Assembly adopted on September 13, 1999.

After failing to win in her first seven races she was still a maiden when she recorded a 25/1 upset victory in the Epsom Oaks. She went on to win the Scarbrough Stakes and dead-heated for the Champion Stakes as well as finishing second in the Jockey Club Stakes and finishing third in the Coronation Cup. She was retired to become a broodmare but died in 1937 after producing only two foals, neither of which survived. Background Chatelaine was a bay mare bred by the Sledmere Stud in Driffield, Yorkshire. As a yearling she was bought for 500 guineas by C M Prior who then leased the filly to Ernest Thornton-Smith. She was trained during her racing career by Fred Templeman at Lambourn in Berkshire. As a young horse Chatelaine was extremely nervous and restless but her temperament improved when she was introduced to \\"Billy\\", a goat who became her constant companion. Her sire Phalaris was an outstanding sprinter who went on to become the most influential stallion of the 20th century and the male-line ancestor of most modern Thoroughbreds. Chatelaine's dam Herself was a very influential broodmare whose other descendants have included Tom Rolfe, Sham, Ack Ack and Bee Bee Bee. Racing career=1932: two-year-old season= Chatelaine failed to win in six starts as a two-year- old in 1932. Her best efforts came when finishing fourth in the Rous Memorial Stakes at Goodwood and in the Imperial Produce Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse when she was a close third to colt Gino. She did not receive a weight in the official Free Handicap in which, unprecededently, the fillies Betty, Brown Betty and Myrobella jointly topped the ratings ahead of the best of the male juveniles. =1933: three-year-old season= In the spring of 1933 Chatelaine contested the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 28 April and ran creditably to finish seventh of the twenty-two runners in a race which saw Brown Betty win from Fur Tor and Myrobella. At Epsom Racecourse on 2 of June Chatelaine, ridden by Sam Wragg, started a 25/1 outsider for the 155th running of the Oaks Stakes. The best-fancied fillies in the fourteen-runner field were Brown Betty, Lord Derby's Versicle and Lord Astor's Betty. The race took place in fine weather in front of a large crowd which included King George V and Queen Mary. Chatelaine upset the odds as she went to the front in the last quarter mile won by one and a half lengths from Solfatara, with the fast-finishing Fur Tor two lengths back in third place ahead of Brown Betty. Billy the goat, who had accompanied her to Epsom was reportedly there to greet her when she returned to her stable after the race. On her first appearance after her Epsom victory, Chatelaine was dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot and finished unplaced behind Betty. At York Racecourse in September Chatelaine finished second to the Epsom Derby runner-up King Salmon in the Great Yorkshire Stakes over fourteen furlongs. Later that month she won the Scarbrough Stakes at Doncaster. Chatelaine ran twice at Newmarket in autumn. The ten furlong Champion Stakes on 11 October saw the filly produce arguably her best performance. Ridden by Gordon Richards she dead-heated for first place with the Aga Khan's four-year-old colt Dastur after what was described as a \\"great duel\\", with the advantage passing back and forth over the last quarter mile. In the Jockey Club Cup on two weeks later she was tried over two and a quarter miles and finished second of the three runners, beaten one and a half lengths by Nitsichin, a five-year-old mare whose wins included the Irish Oaks and the Cesarewitch. =1934: four-year-old season= As a four-year-old, Chatelaine's form was disappointing. She came home last of the three runners behind King Salmon and the American challenger Mate in the Coronation Cup and finished unplaced in the Ascot Gold Cup, won by Felicitation. She did win a race over an official distance one and a half miles at Hurst Park, and survived an objection by the owner of the runner-up, who claimed that the race had been incorrectly run over a longer distance. Assessment and honours Chatelaine's earnings of ¬£8,170 in 1933 made her the fifth most financially successful racehorse in England behind Hyperion, Colombo, Loaningdale (Eclipse Stakes) and Rodosto (2000 Guineas). In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Chatelaine an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record After her racing career, Chatelaine was retired to become a broodmare. She produced two foals, by Dastur and Hyperion respectively, neither of which survived. She died shortly after the second confinement at the age of seven in May 1937.

Plot  Prithivivallabh is based on history of Malwa region of India. The novel depicts the rivalry between Munj, the ruler of Dharanagari and Tailap as well as the romance between Munj and Mrinal. Munj had defeated Tailap several times but Tailap captures Munj with help of his feudatory Yadava king Bhillamraj. In captivity, Munj falls in love with Mrinal, Tailap's widow sister. Celibate Mrinal too falls in his love but in the end Tailap gets Munj killed under the feet of an elephant. The love story of Bhoj, a poet; and Vilas, daughter of Bhillamraj engaged with Satyashraya, son of Tailap; runs in parallel.  Origin  Munshi was interested in medieval history of India and was attracted to Munj's depiction in works of that era. Munshi has mentioned the works of several poets of that time who have praised Munj in their works such as Dhanajaya's Dasarupaka, Dhanika's Avaloka based on Dasarupaka, Dhanpala's son Sarvadeva's Paiya Lachchhi and Rishabhapanchashika in preface of the book. He has also mentioned Nava-sahasanka-charita by Padmagupta written during the reign of Sindhuraja, successor of Munja. Munshi was interested in his love of poetry and his military endeavors. He also studied Tailapa's history. Munshi mentioned that all characters he used in novel are historical like Tailapa's son Akalakacharita or Satyashraya; Bhillam Yadava of Seunadesha, his wife Lakshmi who was daughter of the Rashtrakuta king Zanza of Thana as well as Mrinalvati. Munshi confesses in the preface that he was attracted to Munja as other novelists. He had idea to write novella on him for years and finally started its writing when his friend and publisher Haji Mohammed Allarakha insisted. Haji had died before Munshi completed the novella.  Reception  Prithivivallabh was well received by the readers as well as critics. The book had its second edition in 1924. The book has several editions and has been translated in Hindi. Chandrakant Topiwala lauds depiction of the period, speedy episodes, dramatic presentation, characterization and language. He also lauds lack of complexity in the novel. He adds that even though novel is less historical and more fiction it juxtaposes celibate Mrinal and romantic Munj very well. Prashad Brahmbhatt equates Munj with Friedrich Nietzsche's √úbermensch (Superman). The lack of moral values in the novel raised controversy. It was criticised for its \\"uninhibited presentation of sensuous life bordering to hedonism and irreverent attitude to the Hindu ideals of austerity and abstinence\\". Adaptations The novel was adapted into a silent film in 1924 by Manilal Joshi which was criticized by Mahatma Gandhi for its content. Prithvi Vallabh is 1943 Hindi film directed by Sohrab Modi based on the script written by Munshi which was adapted from the book. Prithvi Vallabh - Itihaas Bhi, Rahasya Bhi is 2018 Indian historical drama broadcast on from Sony Entertainment Television also took inspiration from the book.

Hite's death in an automobile accident; Hite was on the way to his home in New Rochelle, New York, and was crossing the viaduct at 155th Street in Manhattan when his vehicle skidded off the roadway and onto the sidewalk, tore through an iron railing and plunged fifty feet before landing atop a wooden fence, with Hite underneath it, having suffered a fractured skull, a compound fracture to his jaw, and three broken ribs. After it took fifteen minutes to pull him from beneath it, Hite was taken to the hospital, where he died that same night. Both the serial's production and the film studio Hite owned, Thanhouser, went into a long, slow decline following his death. * The Viking (1931), given its public release over three months after producer Varick Frissell's death in an explosion, along with 26 other crew members, on board the SS Viking; the film, shot on location in Newfoundland by co-directors George Melford and Frissell (Melford filming actors, Frissell filming nature) in the winter of 1930‚Äì31, had been nominally complete when Frissell screened it privately at the Nickel Theatre at St. John's on March 5, 1931, but the producer came away feeling it needed more sensational and realistic footage from the Labrador ice floes. Within days, Frissell and his crew re-joined the SS Viking (already used in the film) for its annual seal hunt to shoot more footage; however, the ship quickly became trapped in ice about off the Horse Islands. On March 15, 1931, while trying to film an iceberg, Frissell, cinematographer Alexander Gustavus Penrod, and 25 other film crew members were killed when a cache of dynamite loaded on the vessel, being used for Frissell's film to add to the sensationalism of giant explosions of icebergs, spontaneously blew up, destroying the back of the ship, blowing the stern off the vessel, and causing the Viking to catch fire and sink. The film that had been screened at the Nickel Theatre was subsequently polished and prepared for release by associate producer Roy W. Gates, who directed a prologue featuring Newfoundland explorer Sir Wilfred Grenfell, who had known and worked with Frissell, lionizing the producer and the men who had died with him. A French-language version of the film, Ceux du \\"Viking\\", shot simultaneously with Melford's English-language version by French director Ren√© Ginet and also produced by Frissell and featuring his nature footage, was released in February 1932, 11 months after Frissell's death. * Marie Antoinette (1938), released nearly two years after Irving Thalberg's death from pneumonia. * The Lamp Still Burns (1943), released over six months after Leslie Howard's death in a plane crash. * The Naked City (1948), released over two months after producer and narrator Mark Hellinger's death from a sudden heart attack; after Hellinger's death, executives at Universal Studios were ready to scrap the film, as they had no idea how to market it, and feared it would be a box office failure.

Actors and actresses In several cases, actors or actresses have died prior to the release of a film: either during filming or after it has been completed, but is yet to be released. In the case that the actor dies during filming, their scenes are often completed by stunt doubles, or through special effects. Only people who actually appear in some capacity in a posthumously released film are listed here. Those who were scheduled to start a project, but died before filming began, are not included. =1910s= * A Dash Through the Clouds (1912), released just twenty-three days after aviator and actor Philip Orin Parmelee's death in a plane crash; he was piloting an airplane at an air show in Yakima, Washington, on June 1, 1912, at altitudes variously described from 400 to 2,000 feet, when air turbulence flipped over his airplane and caused it to crash, killing him instantly. * A Woman's Way (1913), In the Haunts of Fear (1913), and The Blight (1913), all released after Joseph Graybill's death at the age of 26‚Äîstrangely, different records state conflicting information as to the cause of Graybill's death; the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) lists it as acute spinal meningitis, and the first death notice in the New York Times contradicts the death certificate as to the day of death‚Äîit lists the cause of death on August 2, not the 3, as a nervous breakdownNew York Times, August 2, 1913, page 7.‚Äîbut an obituary on August 4 lists the cause as gastritis.New York Times, August 4, 1913, page 7. Contradicting all of these, a 1913 Motion Picture Story magazine article states that he had a \\"nervous disorder of the optic nerve and died\\". Finally, Graybill's death certificate states that the cause of death was acute pachymeningitis and a contributory factor was alcohol poisoning; both the certificate and the first death notice note he entered Bellevue Hospital on July 24. * Across the Border (1914), released over a month after Grace McHugh's death during filming; while on location on the Arkansas River in Colorado, re-shooting a scene of McHugh fording the river on horseback, her horse lost its footing, and the actress was thrown into the swift current. Cinematographer Owen Carter stopped filming and plunged into the river to save her; together they succeeded in reaching a sandbar, which unfortunately proved to be quicksand, and they both drowned. Shooting of the picture was otherwise complete, and the film was released with the majority of Grace McHugh's work intact. * The Great Romance (1919), Shadows of Suspicion (1919), and A Man of Honor (1919), all released after Harold Lockwood's death in the 1918 flu pandemic; because he died before filming on Shadows of Suspicion was completed, changes were made to the script, and the film was completed using a double shot from behind to stand in for Lockwood. * The Lone Star Ranger (1919), Wolves of the Night (1919), The Last of the Duanes (1919), and The Spite Bride (1919), all released after Lamar Johnstone's sudden death at age 34 from heart disease. * Paid in Advance (1919), released six days after William Stowell's death in a train accident, while scouting locations for Universal in the Belgian Congo. =1920s= * The Skywayman (1920), released just over a month after daredevil stunt flier and actor Ormer Locklear's death on the last day of filming; while shooting the finale by night, Locklear had to dive the plane, carrying himself and co-pilot Milton 'Skeets' Elliott, towards some oil derricks and appear to crash it. He forewarned the lighting crew to douse their lights when he got near the derricks, so that he could see to pull out of the dive; the lights remained full on, blinding him, and he crashed. The finished film showed this crash, and its aftermath, in gruesome detail. * Everybody's Sweetheart (1920), released less than a month after Olive Thomas' death, at the age of 25; on the night of September 5, 1920, Thomas and her husband, Jack Pickford, went out for a night of entertainment and partying at the famous bistros in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris. Returning to their room in the Hotel Ritz around 3:00 am, Pickford either fell asleep or was outside the room for a final round of drugs. An intoxicated and tired Thomas accidentally ingested a large dose of a mercury bichloride liquid solution, which had been prescribed for her husband's chronic syphilis. Being liquid it was supposed to be applied topically, not ingested.Long, Bruce. Editor. The Life and Death of Olive Thomas. Taylorology Newsletter. Issue 33, September 1995. She had either thought the flask contained drinking water or sleeping pills; accounts vary. The label was in French, which may have added to the confusion. She screamed, \\"Oh, my God!\\", and Pickford ran to pick her up in his arms; however, it was too late, as she had already ingested a lethal dose. She was taken to the American Hospital in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, where she succumbed to the poison a few days later. * Coincidence (1921), released a year after Robert Harron's suicide; he fatally shot himself in the left lung with a revolver due to disappointment that director and mentor D.W. Griffith had passed him over for the starring role in Way Down East. * Foolish Wives (1922), released almost a year after Rudolph Christians' death from pneumonia; the German actor, father of Austrian stage and screen actress Mady Christians, was playing the central part of the cuckolded American envoy in Erich von Stroheim's film.

Mansfield was playing the role of Agatha Warren and had just finished her scenes and retired to a car when her clothing burst into flames. Her neck and face were saved when leading man Wilfred Lytell threw his heavy overcoat over her. The chauffeur of Mansfield's car was burned badly on his hands while trying to remove the burning clothing from the actress. The fire was put out, but she sustained substantial burns to her body. She was rushed to a Physicians and Surgeons Hospital in San Antonio, where she died in less than twenty-four hours; however, most of Mansfield's scenes had already been shot, so production on the film continued. * Greed (1924), released nearly a year after Frank Hayes' death from pneumonia. * The Son of the Sheik (1926), was publicly released a month following Rudolph Valentino's death from peritonitis, although the premiere was a month prior to Valentino's death. * King of the Pack (1926), released nearly four months after canine actor Peter the Great's death while protecting his master; an argument had broken out between owner Edward Faust and a friend of Faust's, culminating with Faust running back to his car while the friend came out of his house with a rifle‚Äîin the process, Peter leapt up to protect his master, and was shot in the neck, lingering for three more days before dying. * The Wedding March (1928), released a year after the deaths of both George Nichols and Hughie Mack. * Two Masters (1928), released nearly a month after Rex Cherryman's death from septic poisoning, which he contracted while sailing to France to read for a play in Paris; he died in Le Havre, France at age 31. * The Rush Hour (1928), released almost five months after Ward Crane's death from pneumonia, following an attack of pleurisy that sent him to a rest cure lodge at Saranac Lake, New York. * Show Boat (1929), released over three months after Ralph Yearsley's suicide. * The Hottentot (1929), The Argyle Case (1929), and The Drake Case (1929), all released after Gladys Brockwell's death in an automobile accident; the car, driven by her friend Thomas Brennan, went over an embankment on the Ventura Highway near Calabasas, and Brockwell, the passenger, ended up crushed beneath it. Brennan later said that a bit of dust had blown into his eye before the accident, temporarily blinding him.

Brown had a collection of firearms and the two men were examining various pieces. Quoting Brown's description of the accident, \\"I was absent-mindedly fooling around with one of the guns. [...] I had a match in my hand and when I clicked, apparently the match caught in between the hammer and the firing pin. There was an explosion. Russ slid to the side of his chair.\\" The ball ricocheted off a nearby table and hit Columbo above the left eye. Surgeons at Good Samaritan Hospital made an unsuccessful attempt to remove the ball from Columbo's brain; he died less than six hours after the shooting. Columbo's death was ruled an accident, and Brown exonerated from blame. * Jew Suss (1934), released six months after Gerald du Maurier's death from colon cancer. * Steamboat Round the Bend (1935) and In Old Kentucky (1935), both released months after Will Rogers' death in an airplane crash; while being flown through Alaska by famed aviator Wiley Post, they became uncertain of their position in bad weather and landed in a lagoon to ask directions.

At a party with the rest of the cast and crew, while shooting at the Aulanko Hotel, Sari and one of the men there (she was engaged, but the man was not her fianc√©e) went up to the roof of the hotel; on the flat roof, there was a several-feet high chimney, with a ladder leading up to the top. Sari mistook this chimney for a scenery balcony, climbed up, and fell into a heating boiler, where she died instantly. Because of Sari's death, the end of the film needed to be changed a bit; the crew shot further away, and so another woman had to replace Sari on these final shots. It was only Sari's third film; she was 19 years old. =1940s= * The Great Awakening (1941), released one month after Barnett Parker's death from a heart attack. * To Be or Not to Be (1942), released one month after Carole Lombard's death in a plane crash. * Above Suspicion (1943), released one month after Conrad Veidt's death from a heart attack. * The Masked Marvel (1943), released two months after David Bacon's mysterious death; he was seen driving a car erratically in Santa Monica, California before running off the road and into the curb.

Universal could not afford to throw out the footage already filmed, so they were forced to adapt the serial: Firstly, another villain (Malborn, played by John Mylong, who was originally just a servant of Sir Eric) was introduced as the boss of Atwill's character to take over most of the villain requirements of the film; secondly, a double of Atwill was used to complete his remaining scenes. The double was filmed from behind and remained silent. The villain's henchmen were filmed repeating their orders back to the silent double and stock footage of Atwill was edited in to show a response. * The Walls Came Tumbling Down (1946) and The Imperfect Lady (1947), both released after Miles Mander's death from a heart attack. * The Naked City (1948), released over two months after producer and narrator Mark Hellinger's death from a sudden heart attack; after Hellinger's death, executives at Universal Studios were ready to scrap the film, as they had no idea how to market it, and feared it would be a box office failure. Hellinger's widow, however, reminded the studio that Hellinger's contract for the film included a \\"guarantee of release\\" clause from Universal; having no choice, Universal released the film into theaters, and were subsequently surprised when it became a hit, garnering two Oscars for the studio. * Noose (1948) and Brass Monkey (1948), both released after Carole Landis' suicide; Landis was reportedly crushed when her lover, actor Rex Harrison, refused to divorce his wife, Lilli Palmer, for her. Unable to cope any longer, she committed suicide at her Pacific Palisades home by taking an overdose of Seconal. She had spent her final night alive with Harrison; the next afternoon, he and the maid discovered her on the bathroom floor. Harrison waited several hours before he called a doctor and the police. According to some sources, Landis left two suicide notes; one for her mother, and the second for Harrison, who instructed his lawyers to destroy it. During a coroner's inquest, Harrison denied knowing any motive for her suicide and told the coroner he did not know of the existence of a second suicide note.Actor Rex Harrison answering questions from coroner Ira Nance at inquiry on Carol Landis' suicide, a July 1948 Los Angeles Times photograph from the UCLA Charles E. Young Research Library website * Red River (1948) and So Dear to My Heart (1949), both released after Harry Carey's death from a combination of lung cancer, emphysema, and coronary thrombosis in 1947; both films had been delayed due to lengthy post-production problems, including the addition of several animated sequences to the latter, a Disney film. * Little Women (1949), released nearly four months after C.

Because Walker died in the middle of production, parts of the film were heavily rewritten; several scenes use a double shot from behind, and others recycle footage of Walker from Strangers on a Train. The final scene, where a recording of John delivers an anti-Communist speech, is lit with a halo around the tape-recorder. * All the Brothers Were Valiant (1953), released three months after Lewis Stone's death from a heart attack. * World for Ransom (1954), released over three months after Nigel Bruce's death from a heart attack. * Return to Treasure Island (1954), released over eight months after Porter Hall's death from a heart attack. * Sign of the Pagan (1954), released over a month after Moroni Olsen's death. * East of Eden (1955), released over six months after Harry Cording's death. * Jail Busters (1955) and Dig That Uranium (1956), both released after Bernard Gorcey's death from a traffic collision. * Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and Giant (1956), both following James Dean's death in an automobile accident in September 1955, just days after filming on the latter was completed; due to his trademark mumbling rendering him inaudible on his final scene of the film, his speech in that scene was overdubbed by his friend Nick Adams after his death.

For example, most of Tracy's dialogue scenes were filmed in a such a way that during close-ups on other characters, a stand-in was substituted for him.Edwards, p.337. Tracy posthumously received his ninth Oscar nomination for his work on the film. * The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967) and Billion Dollar Brain (1967), both released after Fran√ßoise Dorl√©ac's death at the age of 25; the older sister of French actress Catherine Deneuve died when she lost control of the rented Renault 10 she was driving and hit a sign post ten kilometers from Nice at the end of the Esterel-C√¥te d'Azur motorway. The car flipped over, and burst into flames. Dorl√©ac had been en route to Nice airport and was afraid of missing her flight. She was seen struggling to get out of the car, but was unable to open the door; police later identified her body only from the fragment of a cheque book, a diary, and her driving license. * The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz (1968) and The Picasso Summer (1969), both released after Theodore Marcuse's death. * The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield (1968) and Single Room Furnished (1968), both released a year after Jayne Mansfield's death from brain trauma sustained in an automobile crash; the latter film was shot in 1966, but had its release delayed for two years. * Never a Dull Moment (1968), released a year after Philip Coolidge's death. * Fever Heat (1968) and Mission Mars (1968), both released after Nick Adams' death from a drug overdose. * The Bamboo Saucer (1968), released four months after Dan Duryea's death from cancer. * Autopsia de un fantasma (1968), released over fifteen months after Basil Rathbone's death from a heart attack. * Skidoo (1968), released about four months following Phil Arnold's death from a heart attack; another cast member, Fred Clark, died only two weeks prior to the film's release. * The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit (1968), released two weeks after Fred Clark's death. * The Night They Raided Minsky's (1968), over a year after noted comic actor Bert Lahr's death from pneumonia and undiagnosed terminal cancer; while working on the film, Lahr agreed to shoot an extensive night scene outdoors in New York City on a cold December night, causing him to develop the pneumonia that killed him. Due to his death occurring in the middle of production, his role was posthumously made smaller, and what footage needed to be reshot for scenes where Lahr had completed his close-ups employed burlesque legend Joey Faye, shot from behind, to fill in for Lahr. * Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), released seven months after Al Mulock's suicide; Mulock, a noted Canadian character actor, played the gunslinger Knuckles in the opening sequence. This sequence, the last filmed in Spain on the production, was scheduled for four days; Mulock committed suicide after the third day's shooting, for reasons that are still unclear, by jumping from his hotel room window, several floors up, in full costume. Production manager Claudio Mancini and screenwriter Mickey Knox, who were sitting in a room in the hotel, witnessed Mulock's body pass by their window. Knox recalled in an interview that while Mancini put Mulock, still in his costume, in his car to drive him to the hospital, director Sergio Leone said to Mancini, \\"Get the costume! We need the costume!\\" As Mulock had already shot most of his close-ups and a few medium and wide shots, only a double, of similar height and build, was needed to complete the sequence; looking similar enough to pass, screenwriter Knox was drafted into taking Mulock's place for those shots. Mulock's absence is obvious in the last few minutes of the sequence; while the other two gunslingers, played by Woody Strode and Jack Elam, get close-up reaction shots to Charles Bronson's character, Knuckles gets none before he is shot to death. * The Wild Bunch (1969), released over a year after Albert Dekker's death by autoerotic asphyxiation; Dekker had played Pat Harrigan, the unscrupulous railroad detective, in the film. * The Thirteen Chairs (1969), following Sharon Tate's death; it was her last film before her murder. * The Reivers (1969) and The Pursuit of Happiness (1971), both following Ruth White's death from cancer; the former was also released almost a month after Roy Barcroft's death. =1970s= * Skullduggery (1970) released over nine months after Rhys Williams' death. * Patton (1970), released nearly three months after James Edwards' death from a heart attack. * Myra Breckinridge (1970), released three months after William Hopper's death from pneumonia. * The Syndicate: A Death in the Family (1970), released over five months after Eduardo Ciannelli's death. * There Was a Crooked Man...

Because Shaw was so ill during filming, his voice and delivery were subsequently very weak and shaky. After his death, his voice was dubbed by actor Robert Rietty, although impressionist Rich Little also dubbed three words near the end of the picture (\\"Harry, come on\\"), and six words in Shaw's own voice were deemed usable (\\"Too hot in that train\\" and \\"Harry\\"). * Last Embrace (1979), released nearly five months after Lou Gilbert's death. * The Muppet Movie (1979) released nine months after Edgar Bergen's death from kidney disease; he had died during the film's production, after filming his scene. =1980s= * Brubaker (1980), released just under a year after Richard Ward's death from a heart ailment. * The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980), released less than a month after Peter Sellers' death from a heart attack.

Aside from various scenes being rewritten to exclude his character, the scene with the attacking poodles was actually filmed using another actor doubling for Silva, with stuffed poodles attached to his body and covering his face; however, the scene was not included in the film's final cut. * Venus Peter (1989) and We're No Angels (1989), both released after Ray McAnally's death from a heart attack. * The Little Mermaid (1989), released four months after the death of Ben Wright, who played Grimsby, Prince Eric's caretaker. =1990s= * The Exorcist III (1990), released two months after Barbara Baxley's death from cardiac arrest. * The Sheltering Sky (1990), released two months after Jill Bennett‚Äôs death from a suicidal drug overdose. * Down the Drain (1990), released a year after John Matuszak's death from a drug overdose. * Awakenings (1990), released eight months after Dexter Gordon's death from kidney failure and laryngeal cancer. * Voyage of Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair (1990) and The End of Innocence (1990), both released a year after Rebecca Schaeffer's murder. * King of the Wind (1990), released just over seven months after Anthony Quayle's death from liver cancer. * Thieves of Fortune (1990), released about five months after Lee Van Cleef's death from a heart attack. * Jetsons: The Movie (1990), following the deaths of George O'Hanlon and Mel Blanc in 1989; O'Hanlon and Blanc were, respectively, the voices of George Jetson and Mr. Spacely.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 25 in 2000. It is located within the Andrews, Texas micropolitan area. History Florey was named for a pioneer rancher who settled in the community in 1908, and his name was A.J. Florey. It was originally located northeast of where Florey currently stands today. It was originally called Smackover when it was first formed around 1903 by Pete Hollebeke, Willis Howell, Bob Hill, and a family called the Jimerson family. A post office was established at Florey in 1909, and Lee N. Smith was the postmaster. A camp for an oil company called Humble Oil Company, which would later be called Exxon, was established at the townsite in 1934. The area of the settlement was extended to where it currently stands along U.S. Highway 385 sometime after the Humble Oil Company went into operation. There was only one store and an overall population of 50 residents in 1940. The camp was then closed in 1958, and on September 22 of that same year, the Humble Oil Company donated the camp to Andrews County so they could turn it into a park. It then consisted of just that park in 1978. It then reported a population of 25 residents in both 1990 and 2000. Geography Florey stands along U.S. Highway 385, north of Andrews in the northwestern portion of Andrews County. Education Florey's first school was established in 1909, and Miss Edna McCorkle was hired as the school's teacher. It then became a part of the Andrews Independent School District on December 15, 1938. The community is still currently served by the Andrews ISD to this day, since the whole county is one whole school district.

He was a prominent Trotskyist activist in the 1930s and went to Spain where he participated in the Spanish Civil War. In the 1980s he co-founded the Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform (COMER) in the 1980s and continued as the group's principal leader until his death. He died in April 2019 at the age of 105.William Krehm interviewKREHM, Bill Krehm Early life Krehm was born in Toronto to Hyman and Sarah Krehm, Jews who had left the Russian Empire separately between 1905 and 1910, before meeting and marrying in Toronto's St. John's Ward, known as The Ward, a working class district that was home to successive waves of immigrants.IDA KREHM by William Krehm The Globe and Mail (1936-Current); Sep 29, 1998; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Globe and Mail pg. A22 Hyman Krehm and his brother, Harry, had been furriers in Russia and continued that trade in Canada. William Krehm was a talented violinist and his sister, Ida (1912-1998), a promising pianist prompting their parents to send both of them to Chicago to study music in the 1920s. While Ida remained in Chicago, ultimately marrying musician and industrialist Joseph Pick, and becoming a pianist and conductor of international renown, William Krehm moved to New York City where he worked selling hats. After the 1929 Stock Market Crash, he became interested in Marxism. Returning to Toronto, he attended Parkdale Collegiate Institute and was a tutor to fellow student Gladys Cowan whom he would later marry. He graduated from high school in 1930 and studied mathematics at the University of Toronto for two years before dropping out for lack of funds. Other sources, however, describe him as a University of Toronto graduate. Trotskyism By 1932, Krehm had become a Trotskyist, recruited to the movement by Albert Glotzer, and joined the nascent Canadian Trotskyist movement in Toronto, which was a branch of the US-based Communist League of America. Krehm led a faction in opposition to Canadian Trotskyist leader Maurice Spector and dropped in and out of the organization, eventually moving to Montreal and becoming leader of the party branch there. In 1934, Krehm and his followers, along with B. J. Field and his followers in the United States, left the CLA to form the Organizing Committee for a Revolutionary Workers Party (later known as the League for a Revolutionary Workers Party, and colloquially as the \\"Fieldites\\"), and affiliated with the international organization known as the International Bureau of Revolutionary Socialist Parties or London Bureau. Krehm became leader of the Canadian group and editor of its newspaper Workers' Voice. Spanish Civil War In July 1936, Krehm sailed to Europe via the RMS Empress of Britain. Krehm went to Europe as the League for a Revolutionary Workers Party's delegate to a conference of the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre being held in Brussels in October. He visited Barcelona for five days in September before returning to Belgium, and went back to Spain the following month, after the conference, becoming one of 1,600 Canadians who volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War. Krehm left in late 1936 to attend a conference of left-wing groups in Paris and then went to London where he met Charles Donnelly, spending Christmas with him. Donnelly urged Krehm to join the International Brigades with him. However, he decided to return to Spain on his own and joined the Partido Obrero de Unificaci√≥n Marxista (POUM) as a propagandist, translator and journalist, and as such would occasionally visit the front lines, and was one of the last survivors of that conflict. He met fellow POUM member Eric Arthur Blair, (better known by his pen name, George Orwell), and used to chat with him in the cafes of Barcelona. Krehm was in Barcelona during the May Days street battles when the Comintern-affiliated Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia attempted to eliminate the POUM. In June 1937, after the POUM was outlawed by the Spanish Republic at the instigation of the Communist Party, the house in which Krehm was staying was raided by Spanish secret police and he and his comrades were detained with Krehm under suspicion of being a spy He spent three months in jail and was released after a hunger strike, driven by police to the French border, and expelled from Spain in August 1937, arriving in Halifax at the end of November. Krehm returned to Toronto where he wrote a pamphlet, Spain: Revolution and Counter-Revolution, and toured Canada and the US giving speeches about his experiences in Spain. Anti-fascist activism in Canada Resuming his leadership of the Canadian section of the League for a Revolutionary Workers Party which was, for a time, larger and more active than the official Trotskyist group it had split from. In July 1938, he was charged with obstructing police who were trying to disperse an anti-fascist rally organized by the League for a Revolutionary Workers Party and held across from a fascist rally held by the National Union Party at Massey Hall.Lacks Proof Of Charges, The Globe and Mail (1936-Current); Jul 15, 1938; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Globe and Mail pg. 4 Krehm was arrested after he refused a police request to call off the rally. In response, a rally was organized in the United States which organizers estimated to have attracted 4,000 protesters. Krehm and his colleague were found guilty and fined $25 each.Two Freed, Two Fined, After Obstruction Charge, The Globe and Mail (1936-Current); Toronto, Ont. [Toronto, Ont]16 July 1938: 5. Foreign correspondent in Latin America Finding that the Trotskyist movement had dwindling support, and increasingly disillusioned by revolutionary politics following his experiences in Spain, Krehm moved to Mexico, arriving with only $270 in his pocket, in the hopes of working as a foreign correspondent. When World War II broke out he wanted to return to Canada to enlist in the military but couldn't when he found he was not allowed to cross the border into the United States. While in Mexico City, he sought and was granted an interview with Leon Trotsky but the exiled Soviet revolutionary was assassinated on August 21, 1940 before the interview could take place. Krehm stood guard over his body at his funeral. Krehm would remain in Latin America for eight years. During this period, Gladys left Canada to join him and they married and had a son, Adam, while the couple was living in Peru. After struggling for several years as a freelance journalist, Krehm was hired by Time Magazine in 1943 as the magazine's correspondent in Latin America. With the emergence of the Cold War, Krehm was fired by Time in 1947 after writing several articles and a book critical of American intervention in Latin America and the Caribbean. Return to Canada Unemployed, Krehm returned to Canada in 1948 with his wife and worked as a music critic for The Globe and Mail and CBC Radio, appearing on CJBC Views The Shows in the mid-1950s.York Concert Group Told of Mahler Work The Globe and Mail (1936-Current); Feb 14, 1958; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Globe and Mail pg. 12http://www.comer.org/archives/2013/COMER_November2013.pdf As the Cold War intensified in the 1950s, Krehm found that his radical past imperiled his employability. His home was frequently visited by the RCMP Security Service and his appearances on CBC came to an end. Finding it difficult to sustain enough employment to support his family, which had grown with the birth of a second son, Jonathan, Krehm decided to start his own business as a home builder and property developer in the mid-1950s. In 1963, he and his brother-in-law, Ben Cowan, founded what is now O'Shanter Development Co.Rent controls need changing, landlord says: INDUSTRY SPEAKS OUT, Krehm, William, The Globe and Mail (1936-Current); Nov 5, 1983; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Globe and Mail pg. H21 Benefiting from the post-war property development boom in the Toronto suburbs during the post-war housing boom, Krehm became wealthy and O'Shanter became on of Toronto's biggest landlords. In the 1970s and 80s, he campaigned against rent control after it was introduced by the provincial government. Krehm retired from O'Shanter in the 1980s, turning the operation of the company over to his sons, who continue to own and operate it today. COMER Krehm retired in the 1980s and devoted his time to studying and writing on economics, co-founding the Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform later in the 1980s. In 2011, Krehm was the co- plaintiff in a suit by COMER against the Bank of Canada in an attempt to compel it to provide debt-free support for public projects undertaken by federal, provincial and city governments. The plaintiffs argued that by not doing so, the Bank was violating the Bank of Canada Act. The lawsuit also alleged that the federal government had ceded its sovereign ability to conduct independent monetary policy to \\"secret\\" deliberations and private foreign bankers. The case was dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal in 2016. In May 2017, the Supreme Court of Canada denied the plaintiffs' request for leave to appeal. Later life Krehm continued playing violin into his 90s. He died, aged 105, in Toronto in 2019.

It is located within the Andrews, Texas micropolitan area, approximately 15 miles west of Andrews. History Frankel City was started by Andrews County's oil boom. It was first called Fullerton when it was first established in 1941, and the Fullerton Oil Company drilled a discovery well in the area. More wells were drilled in the community during World War II, and there was a total of 100 oil rigs successfully drilling in the county in a -by- area four years later in 1945. There were oilfield supply stores opened by several companies, and they built camps on the area's sand hills for the families of about 750 workers, including the workers. A post office was established at Fullerton in 1948, and G.W. Blanchard became postmaster. It was then renamed Frankel City in honor of the Frankel Brothers Oil Company. The community's first and only mayor was named Skeet Morris. Even though oil drilling was successful in the community, it unfortunately began to decline, and the post office remained in operation until March 12, 1976. Frankel City had several stores and filling stations, two cafes, two churches, and a telephone exchange at one time. It consisted of a caf√©, only one house, a mobile home, and an estimated 11 inhabitants by the 1980s. Geography Frankel City sits at the juncture of Farm to Market Roads 181 and 1967 in the western portion of Andrews County. Education In 1945, students in the community rode to school by bus, since the nearby city of Andrews had the county's only school at that time. The community continues to be served by the Andrews Independent School District to this day, since all of Andrews County is also one whole school district.

Her portrait, painted around 1674 by John Michael Wright, is held in the Powis Castle collection. Popish Plot  She was Lady of the Bedchamber to Catherine of Braganza, queen consort of King Charles II of England. However, in 1678, her husband was one of the \\"Five Catholic Lords\\" who were falsely accused of treason in the Popish Plot fabricated by Titus Oates, and he was imprisoned in the Tower of London until 1684. His wife's frantic efforts to secure his release led her into unwise dealings with such unsavoury underworld characters as the notorious informer and confidence trickster Thomas Dangerfield. She had hoped that Dangerfield would discredit her husband's accusers: but Dangerfield, who was \\"faithless to all\\" turned on Lady Powis and her friend, the prominent Catholic midwife Elizabeth Cellier , instead and accused them of treason. Fortunately by the time they came to trial in the summer of 1680, Dangerfield's reputation had sunk so far that they were both easily acquitted.Kenyon, J.P. \\"The Popish Plot\\" Phoenix Press reissue 2000 pp.227-8 Later life On 24 March 1686, her husband was created Marquess of Powis, and his wife became a marchioness. A Catholic, he was loyal to King James II and VII, whom he followed into exile. James created him 1st Duke of Powis and 1st Marquess of Montgomery on 12 January 1689, in the Jacobite peerage. He was subsequently outlawed from England. The marchioness followed her husband into exile and acted as First Lady of the Bedchamber to James's queen, Mary of Modena, and as Royal Governess to James, Prince of Wales, until her death in 1691.

In the battle, Imperial troops under Octavio Piccolomini defeated the Swedish army under Field Marshal Johan Baner.  Course of the battle  In preparation for the campaign against Regensburg, Swedish troops under Johan Baner made their winter quarters in 1640/1641 in the Upper Palatinate at Cham near the Bohemian border, with the aim of joining forces with the regiments of the French commander, Jean Baptiste Budes de Gu√©briant. At that time, only the Swedish troops were used to winter campaigning.Geijer, Eric Gustave, The History of the Swedes, tr. by J.H. Turner, London: Whitaker, 1845, p. 307. On , Baner's camp was attacked by Imperial troops and his army, which was clearly outnumbered and weakened by casualties, became almost surrounded. Baner was forced to beat a hasty retreat to Saxony using the shorter route via Bohemian soil, pursued by Imperial cavalry regiments. On 27 March Baner's men pulled out of Kaaden in the Ore Mountains heading for the little town of Pre√ünitz. Piccolomini sought to pre-empt Baner's move by taking a shorter, but more difficult route across the crest of the Ore Mountains to occupy the Pre√ünitz passes in the Bohemian Forest, but he was half-an-hour too late.Malleson, G.B. The Battlefields of Germany, London: Allen, 1884, p. 186. On reaching the vicinity of the town, a heavy rearguard action broke out that lasted until midnight. Meanwhile, Ban√©r's troops secured their withdrawal using the deep forests north and south of Pre√ünitz and even built a wagon fort, from which they engaged the Imperial troops with artillery. Covered by this makeshift fort, the Swedes withdrew to Annaberg. The Swedish infantry, covered by the cannon behind the wagon fort, had an advantage over the heavy imperial cavalry in the thickly snow-covered and muddy terrain, but their opponent's superiority in numbers proved too much. Baner lost about 4,000 men, almost a third of his strength. However, the Swedish army escaped a total defeat and eventually made it from Annaberg to Zwickau. Shortly after this battle, Ban√©r died in a camp near Halberstadt on 10 May 1641, aged 45.

It was the fourth UKIP leadership election in eighteen months. Interim leader Gerard Batten was ultimately elected unopposed as the party's new leader.  Background  After the UK's referendum on EU membership in June 2016 resulted in a vote to leave the European Union, then-leader of UKIP Nigel Farage announced his resignation. In September 2016, Diane James was elected to succeed him, but resigned after 18 days, triggering another leadership election. Held in November 2016, it was won by Paul Nuttall. Nuttall led the party into the 2017 UK general election, but resigned after UKIP's vote share fell from 12.6% to 1.8% and the party failed to win any parliamentary seats. Henry Bolton was elected to succeed Nuttall in September 2017. In January 2018, UKIP's NEC passed a motion of no confidence in Bolton, following controversy about his personal life. Bolton refused to step down, which triggered an emergency general meeting. This meeting was held on 17 February 2018, and those attending voted by 867 votes to 500 to remove him as leader. Gerard Batten took over as interim leader and the leadership election had to be held within 90 days, before 18 May 2018. Bill Etheridge, an MEP who had twice stood for the leadership previously, initially announced his intention to stand again, but then withdrew to support Batten. Batten proposed, in order to avoid the expense of a leadership election, that he be elected uncontested to serve a 12-month term. The Guardian understood that the party was trying to ensure an uncontested leadership election by raising financial and membership requirements.

Husney is known for his discovery and management of the artist Prince and Prince's 1977 signing to Warner Bros. Records‚Äîthen one of the largest contracts for a new artist in history. Biography=Early life= Husney was born on September 8, 1947 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota.

Husney played guitar and acted as the band's manager. With the addition of Doug Ahrens, Jay Luttio, and Rick Beresford, they recorded a garage rock version of Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland's Turn On Your Love Light. The single received extensive airplay in on local Top 40 stations WDGY and KDWB, entering the top 10 locally, and eventually gained airplay in other markets including: Kansas, Colorado, Texas, and California. The band's final performance was on July, 1968 when Siegel headed off for military service. =Promotion and The Ad Company= Following the dissolution of The High Spirits, Husney began his career on the business side of the music industry by providing backstage catering to a local Minneapolis venue serving touring acts such as Janis Joplin, Stevie Wonder, The Rolling Stones, and The Who.

Husney built a team around the young artist with the express purpose of making a new demo tape to secure a record contract for the young artist at a major record label, Husney used the resources of his advertising company to create promotional materials including a press kit to go along with a professionally recorded demo tape, recorded by then local engineer David Z at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis. In the summer of 1977, Husney negotiated a three-album contract with Warner Bros., preserving Prince's publishing rights for himself and successfully convincing the record executives to allow Prince to produce his own first album. The contract was signed on June 25, 1977.

It is listed on the sub market of the London Stock Exchange AIM. History The company was founded in 1984, by structural engineer Michael Ellis. In the year to 30 April 2015, Van Elle‚Äôs turnover rose 57% from 2014's ¬£46m to ¬£72.5m for the year to April 2015. Profit more than tripled, from ¬£2.8m to ¬£9m, and headcount grew from around 300 to over 400. In October 2016, the company was floated on the AIM sub market of the London Stock Exchange, achieving a market capitalisation of ¬£80m. Van Elle was forecasting revenues for 2016 approaching ¬£85m. Ellis retired the following December, but remained a shareholder in the company. In 2017, delays in rail projects caused turnover to drop. In November 2017, Ellis started an attempt to remove the company's chief executive Jon Fenton and a senior independent director, Robin Williams, citing concerns about the company's management, departures of key staff and financial forecasts. During the dispute, the company faced questions after it wrote off more than ¬£330,000 of work building a new house for Fenton (who announced he would be stepping down from the company due to a family illness), while Ellis accused Van Elle directors of making personal attacks ahead of a shareholders' vote in December on returning him to the board. The board rebutted Ellis's criticism, accusing him of damaging the company. At the shareholders meeting, Ellis's bid to return to the board was rejected. In January 2018, the company warned it would potentially lose ¬£1.6 million as a result of the collapse of Carillion, for whom it was working as a subcontractor on projects for Network Rail. Van Elle also reported uncertainty relating to ¬£2.5m worth of future work for Network Rail, with a potential impact on future financial results. Interim results for the year to 31 October 2017, showed the firm made an underlying pre tax profit of ¬£5.4m on turnover of ¬£52.6m. In January 2019, Van Elle reported pretax profits down 54% to ¬£2.4m as turnover fell 18% to ¬£42.9m in the six months to 31 October 2018, with its CEO blaming Carillion's collapse for the profit slump. Two further profit warnings followed as its share-price halved ahead of its annual results announcement in July 2019. Results for the year to 30 April 2019 showed a 56.5% fall in pre tax profits (to ¬£4m from ¬£9.2m) as turnover dropped from ¬£103.9m to ¬£88.5m; during the year, the company's share price fell from 82p to 35p, valuing the company at ¬£29m.

Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980), is a United States Supreme Court case involving issues of privacy in correspondence with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the freedom of the press, the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. After a murder case ended in three mistrials, the judge closed the fourth trial to the public and the press. On appeal, the Supreme Court ruled the closing to be in violation of the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment asserting that the First Amendment implicitly guarantees the press access to public trials.  Background  At about 6:00pm on December 2, 1975, the body of Lillian M. Keller, the manager of the Holly Court Motel, was found stabbed to death in her apartment. Howard Franklin Bittorf, a resident in the motel at the time of the murder, and his brother-in-law, John Paul Stevenson were indicted on March 16, 1976 by the Commonwealth of Virginia grand jury for Hanover county for the murder.  Prior litigation  On July 16, 1976 a Hanover County Circuit Court jury found Stevenson guilty of second-degree murder. On appeal, on October 7, 1977, Stevenson's conviction was overturned by the Virginia Supreme Court due to issues of hearsay and inconclusive forensic test results.. On May 30, 1978, during Stevenson's second trial, a juror requested to be excused and no alternate was obtainable. Stevenson's second trial was declared a mistrial. On June 6, 1978, Stevenson's third trial was also declared a mistrial because a potential juror revealed information about Stevenson's previous trials to other potential jurors. On September 11, 1978, Stevenson's fourth trial began. The defense filed a motion for the trial to be closed to the press and public, in order to protect Stevenson's right to a fair trial, without any objections from the prosecution or the two Richmond Newspaper reporters present. Judge Richard H. C. Taylor acting in accordance with a state statute which \\"authorizes the court in its discretion to exclude from the trial any persons whose presence would impair the conduct of a fair trial\\" granted the motion and ordered the courtroom to be cleared of all unnecessary parties, including the Richmond reporters. Later that same day, however, Richmond Newspapers requested \\"a hearing on a motion to vacate the closure order\\" arguing that there was no significant evidence supporting closure and that the judge did not consider any alternative measures to ensure a fair trial. The trial judge denied the motion and, therefore, ordered closure. Afterwards, Stevenson's fourth trial continued, without the presence of the public, press, or jury. The trial judge found Stevenson, not guilty. On November 8, 1978, the newspaper filed an appeal with the Virginia Supreme Court, asking the court to find the closing of the Stevenson trial to be in error. The Virginia Supreme Court, on July 9, 1979, dismissed the appeal, citing a recent United States Supreme Court decision in Gannett v. DePasquale.. Issued just a week prior, the decision held that there is \\"no public right to a public trial.\\" Considering the confusion that the Gannett v. DePasquale ruling caused, along with an increase in courtroom closings, many other press organizations joined Richmond Newspapers as they brought their case to the United States Supreme Court.  Supreme Court = Argument = J. Marshall Coleman, Attorney General of Virginia, argued for the appellees before the Supreme Court. Richmond Newspapers, Inc. appealed the Virginia Supreme Court's decision to the United States Supreme Court. Oral Argument took place on February 2, 1980 with Laurence H. Tribe arguing on behalf of Richmond Newspapers and J. Marshall Coleman, the Attorney General of Virginia at the time, arguing on behalf of Virginia, et al. In his opening argument, Laurence Tribe asserted that the reasons given by the court to close the trial (including the layout of the courtroom and the possibility of prejudicial information affecting the impartiality of the jury) were not compelling enough to order closure. Additionally, Tribe argued that the trial judge had not utilized nor considered other, less drastic alternatives to ensure the fairness of the trial. Subsequently, Tribe claimed that the Virginia statute, which authorized the trial judge in this case to close off the entire trial to the press and public, was unconstitutional, violating the Sixth Amendment, which grants the right to a public trial, the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects citizenship rights, and the freedom of the press clause of the First Amendment. In his oral argument, Coleman asserted that the amendments in question, particularly the Sixth Amendment, were in place to protect the accused, not the public. Furthermore, Coleman argued that the statute in question was, indeed, constitutional because, acting in accordance with the statute, the prosecutor, the judge, and the defense counsel, \\"two of whom are charged with representing the public interest,\\" all agreed to the closure. He also went on to say that tapes of the fourth Stevenson trial became available to the public after the completion of the trial, although Tribe later refuted that \\"a violation of publicity is not rectified by the existence of a tape recording.\\" After Coleman concluded, Tribe returned to continue his oral argument. On the matter of overruling Gannett, Tribe contended that such a measure was unnecessary as the ruling in Gannett was applicable to pretrial suppression hearings, while the Richmond case referred to trials, not pretrials. He concluded his argument by stating that a \\"standard of compelling need\\" is needed in order for a judge to close a trial to the press and public. = Decision = Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote the opinion of the Court. In July 1980, the Court determined in a 7-1 decision in favor of Richmond Newspapers, Inc. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote the opinion of the Court. Joined by Justice Byron White and Justice John Paul Stevens, Justice Burger began the opinion with a thorough review of the history and concept of a public trial, explaining that, traditionally, courts have been open to \\"all who care to observe.\\" The Court then went on to discuss the merit of a Constitutional argument for a public trial: > The State argued that the Constitution and Bill of Rights do not contain any > explicit provisions which guarantee the public a right to access. The Court > said that the First and Fourteenth Amendment expressly guarantee freedom of > speech, freedom of the press and the right to public assembly, share a > common purpose of assuring freedom of communication on matters relating to > the functioning of government and were enacted against the backdrop of the > long history of trials being presumptively open. Therefore ‚Äòthe First > Amendment guarantees of speech and press, standing alone, prohibit > government from summarily closing courtroom doors which had long been open > to the public at the time the Amendment was adopted. Justice Burger chose not to make a case for the public's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial, unlike Justice Harry Blackmun in his Gannett decision. The Court concluded its opinion by stating \\"The right to attend criminal trials is implicit in the guarantees of the First Amendment; without the freedom to attend such trials, which people have exercised for centuries, important aspects of freedom of speech and of the press could be eviscerated.\\"  Concurrences  Justice White, despite joining the majority opinion, wrote separately to state that this particular case would have been unnecessary had the Gannett decision been narrower, forbidding the exclusion of the public from criminal trials in more specifically-tailored circumstances. Justice Stevens, who also joined the majority opinion, wrote separately to \\"emphasize that until this decision the Court had accorded virtually absolute protection to the dissemination of information or ideas, but never before had it squarely held that the acquisition of newsworthy matter is entitled to any constitutional protection whatsoever.\\" Justice William J. Brennan also wrote a concurrence, which was joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall. Justice Brennan noted that there is a right for the public to attend trials implicitly stated in the Constitution and that alone signifies that a trial judge or other parties cannot constitutionally close off a trial to the public. Justice Potter Stewart, on the other hand, concurred that the right of public access to trials is not always guaranteed and certain circumstances may justify a limitation on the unrestricted presence of the public at the trial. He continued to state, however, \\"in this case the trial judge failed to recognize the right of the press and public to be present.\\" Justice Harry Blackmun wrote separately, arguing that there is a Sixth Amendment argument to be made for the right of a public trial.  Dissent  Justice William Rehnquist filed a dissent finding that there is no explicit guarantee for public access to the courtroom in the Constitution and, therefore, \\"if the prosecution and the defense find that they have adequate reasons to close a trial to the public, this should be upheld by the Courts.\\"  See also  *Time, Inc. v.

The lower battery with seven gun emplacements, originally mounted French 42 Pounder smooth bore guns on traversing platforms. The upper level contains barrack accommodation, magazine, casemates, entrance gateway and an upper battery for two 24 Pounder smooth bore guns on the northern flank of this level. The tower is quadrant- shaped in plan with corners rounded off and was armed with a 24 Pounder gun and a 5.5-inch howitzer. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars the defences were neglected and not updated. By the 1860s the Fort was armed with an 18 Pounder gun and 5.5-inch howitzer in the tower. The upper battery had a 24 pounder gun. By this time the Fort was obsolete and was disarmed and abandoned by the military in the 1870s.

The project was initiated by a Belarusian entrepreneur Viktor Prokopenya and then was developed by the Belarus High Technologies Park and representatives of the Belarusian IT market. The decree was signed on December 21, 2017. As a result of the Decree introduction, Belarus has not only adopted the widespread institutions of UK law like convertible bonds, non-compete agreements, but also has become the first country in the world to legalize smart contracts.  History  In early 2017, the Belarusian IT community actively discussed prospects for the development of the industry and the possibility of supporting technology companies through the Belarus High-Tech Park. Critics acknowledged the institution‚Äôs contribution, but noted that the existing model of work created the conditions for the growth of custom software development and IT outsourcing, but did not help companies that create their own software products. According to market participants, work for foreign companies did not create the prospect of rapid growth, and there was not enough system and a legal framework of venture financing for the development of Belarusian start-ups. Alongside the discussions in the professional community, in January 2017, at a closed meeting in the Administration of the President of the Republic of Belarus, a decision was taken to develop a new plan for the development of the IT industry, including new measures to support Belarusian IT companies and the introduction of information technology at state companies. Work on the plan was put in charge of Vsevolod Yanchevsky, the President assistant, well-known for his liberal views, the head of the main ideological department of the presidential administration and the curator of the direction of ensuring state policy in the spheres of information and high technologies. Resignation of an irreplaceable head of the Belarus High Technologies Park Valery Tsepkalo on March 2, 2017 was unexpected for the industry. Representatives of the IT industry and journalists made an assumption that the resignation could be related to the failure to achieve a number of stated goals and targets in 2016 as well as Tsepkalo‚Äôs conservative and passive approach to the development of the park. On March 13, Alexander Lukashenko visited IT companies in Belarus - Banuba Development and EXP Capital, whose net income per employee is 5.6 and 4.3 times bigger respectively than other residents of the High-Tech Park in 2016. The President discussed with the technological entrepreneurs and investors Viktor Prokopenya and Mikhail Gutseriyev the idea of creating an IT Development Council that would unite representatives of relevant departments, businessmen and investors in the sphere of high technologies. On March 15, the President of Belarus appointed Vsevolod Yanchevsky as the new head of the High-Tech Park. A month later, on April 21, in his annual address to the parliament and the Belarusian people, Alexander Lukashenko instructed to develop a new decree on the High-Tech Park, which would attract international companies engaged in the most promising areas ‚Äî driverless transport, artificial intelligence, digital currencies. To develop a new decree, the administration of the High-Tech Park attracted representatives of the IT industry and expert community, held dozens of meetings with technology companies, as well as Belarusian and international legal and consulting firms, including Aleinikov & Partners, Vlasova, Mikhel & Partners, Baker Tilly Bel and others. The main author of the decree is called a Belarusian lawyer Denis Aleinikov , who developed a legal framework for smart contracts and proposed to implement institutions of ‚ÄúEnglish law‚Äù to boost venture capital financing in Belarus . The concept of a decree named in the IT community \\"Decree on the High-Tech Park 2.0\\" was published for the first time in a number of sources in July 2017 and was widely discussed by market participants and economists during the summer. In September, the draft was submitted to Alexander Lukashenko as a part of a package of liberal reforms of business legislation. During the discussion of Decree 2.0, the president suggested rethinking the title of the document, as its provisions affected not only the High-Tech Park, but also the Belarusian economy at large. By the beginning of December, a document called the \\"Decree on the Development of Digital Economy\\" had been approved by all authorized public authorities and again submitted to the president. On December 11, 2017, Alexander Lukashenko held a meeting on the draft of the decree with the government officials and well-known representatives of the IT community and announced that he planned to sign the document by the end of 2017. The decree was signed by the president on December 21. In 2018, almost 200 companies became HTP residents. This is two times more than in the entire history of the Park. In 2006, 15 residents registered in the Park; as of November 2017, their number was 192. As of November 2018, 388 companies were residents of the Park. The export of IT in the first half of 2018 increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year.  Key points  The provisions of the decree \\"On the Development of Digital Economy\\" create of a legal basis for the circulation of digital currencies and tokens based on blockchain technology, so that resident companies of the High-Tech Park can provide the services of stock markets and exchange offices with cryptocurrencies and attract financing through the ICO. For legal entities, the Decree confers the rights to create and place their own tokens, carry out transactions through stock markets and exchange operators; to individuals the Decree gives the right to engage in mining, to own tokens, to acquire and change them for Belarusian rubles, foreign currency and electronic money, and to bequeath them. Up to 1 Jan In 2023, the Decree excludes revenue and profits from operations with tokens from the taxable base. In relation to individuals, the acquisition and sale of tokens is not considered entrepreneurial activity, and the tokens themselves and income from transactions with them are not subject to declaration. The peculiarity of the introduced regulation is that all operations will have to be carried out through the resident companies of the High Technology Park. In addition, the decree includes: * Extension of the validity period of the special legal regime of the High-Tech Park until January 1, 2049, and expansion of the list of activities of resident companies. Under the new rules, developers of blockchain-based solutions, developers of machine learning systems based on artificial neural networks, companies from the medical and biotechnological industries, developers of unmanned vehicles, as well as software developers and publishers can become residents. The list of promising areas is unlimited and can be expanded by the decision of the High-Tech Park supervisory board. * Preservation of existing benefits for resident companies in the High-Tech Park, including the cancellation of the profit tax (instead of which a contribution of 1% of the gross revenues proceeding to the administration of the park is applied), reduced to 9% of the personal income tax rate for employees, and the right to contribute to the Social Protection Fund according to the national average figures, and not the actual salaries. * Exemption of foreign companies providing marketing, advertising, consulting and other services to the residents of the High-Tech Park from paying value-added tax, as well as paying income tax, which allows to promote IT products of Belarusian companies in foreign markets. To encourage investments, the Decree also exempts foreign companies from the tax on income from the alienation of shares, stakes in the authorized capital and shares in the property of residents of the High-Tech Park (under condition of continuous possession of at least 365 days). * Introduction of individual English law institutions for residents of the High-Tech Park, which will make it possible to conclude option contracts, convertible loan agreements, non-competition agreements with employees, agreements with responsibility for enticing employees, irrevocable powers of attorney and other documents common in international practice. This measure is aimed at simplifying the structuring of transactions with foreign capital. * Simplification of the regime of currency transactions for residents of the High-Tech Park, including the introduction of a notification procedure for currency transactions, the cancellation of the mandatory written form of foreign trade transactions, the introduction of confirmation of the conducted operations by primary documents drawn up unilaterally. Also, the decree removes restrictions on resident companies for transactions with electronic money and allows opening accounts in foreign banks and credit and financial organizations without obtaining permission from the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus. * Simplification of the procedure for recruiting qualified foreign specialists by resident companies of the High-Tech Park, including the abolition of the recruitment permit, the simplified procedure for obtaining a work permit, and the visa-free regime for the founders and employees of resident companies with a term of continuous stay of up to 180 days.  Discussion  The publication of the key points of the ‚ÄúDecree 2.0‚Äù in June 2017 was warmly received by the participants of the IT industry, but faced criticism from one of Belarusian economists. A noteworthy episode was the remote debate of Sergei Chaly, an economist and the host of the TV show \\"Economics in lay terms\\", and Nikolay Markovnik, general manager of the investment company VP Capital Belarus, which belongs to Viktor Prokopenya. Chaly expressed his point of view in the release of his own program and an interview to the European Radio for Belarus, and Markovnik ‚Äì in columns on the Internet sources Dev.by, KYKY.ORG and TUT.BY. According to the economist, the authors of the decree draft should focus on the overall development of civil law reform, the beneficial effect of which would affect all sectors of the economy. Markovnik answered to Chaly that the reform should start in a testbox which would be used later for overall reform, so the authors of the Decree focused on the IT-sphere they understand and on the obstacles to its growth. Chaly supposed that the tax preferences created by the Decree for the IT market within the High-Tech Park will be provided at the expense of taxes from other branches of the Belarusian economy. According to Markovnik, reducing the bureaucratic burden on the IT companies in the future will serve as a precedent for changes in other sectors of the economy (as it happened earlier with the introduction of a flat scale of income tax and contributions to the Social Protection Fund, first implemented in the High Technology Park in 2005, and then everywhere in 2009) and they are building Communism in IT sector. Chaly supposed that the activities of the resident companies of the park are not very promising given their record, since the IT startup market is controlled by large international corporations. Markovnik pointed out that the orientation of Belarusian IT companies to foreign markets means that the support of their work can only harm their foreign competitors, and the Belarusian economy will only benefit from increased tax revenues of IT companies. According to the economist, unmanned cars are not introduced into Belarus and have no demand for their current price, crypto-currencies could be risky economic bubbles, and the technology of the blockchain is technical not legal, and is only applicable to the operation of cryptocurrencies. Markovnik, being himself a lawyer, also blamed the opponent for not understanding modern technologies (unmanned cars, blockchain technology), claimed that the best world education is now offered at Coursera and Khanacademy, and noted that the expanded list of the directions of work at the High-Tech Park was drawn up taking into account the main trends, and the Decree creates the legal basis necessary for the development of breakthrough technologies. One of the developers of the document, attorney Denis Aleinikov noted that as a result of the Decree introduction, Belarus has not only adopted the widespread institutions of UK law like convertible bonds, non-compete agreements, but also has become the first country in the world to legalize smart contracts. Criticism Tut.by reported that due to one of the tax benefits of Decree, social security payments are levied from employers and paid to the employees of IT companies calculated not on the basis of their real amounts, which are substantially higher than the average salary, but calculated and paid based on the amount of the country average salary. This leads to low social payments to IT employees for the sick leaves, consequently, IT employees prefer not to take sick leave. Moreover, pension would also be calculated for such employees in the same way, and only few IT employees start to think about their future.

It is a four-sided chapel decorated with blue and white tiles and has a pyramidal roof.  History  According to the legend, Memory Hermitage was built by the order of the knight in 1182 after Our Lady of Nazar√© saved him from falling off the cliff when he was following a deer on a horse. It happened where the original statue of Our Lady, sculpted by St. Joseph in her presence and then painted by St. Luke, was placed next to a small altar by Roderic, king of the Visigoths. The statue was brought to this place by Roderic in 714 along with a monk Romano from the monastery located near the city of M√©rida after Guadalete defeat. When the monk died, Roderic placed the statue on an altar in the grotto where the monk was buried. Therefore, the statue was preserved during centuries of Muslim rule in this region. This image was found in a cave in 1179 over which D.F. Roupinho had the hermitage constructed in 1182 on the edge of the cliff. In 1616 a historian of the Kingdom, Bernardo de Brito visited Sitio to fulfill a vow, where he attempted to find the cave the image was found from. He excavated the basement of the Chapel with the help of other devotees, and succeeded to find the cave. According to the legends, whoever attempted to go too far inside the cave, disappeared. Once a priest accompanied by his dog tried to enter the cave attached to a long rope and never came back, so a wall was built to prevent access to the remotest part of the cave and grids were placed in its entrance. Visitors can only see the entrance of the cave on which there is a niche the image of Our Lady placed.  Features = Exterior = The ramparts of the first chapel were open with four arches to make the image visible from 4 sides, also from land and sea. Considering its deterioration, Ferdinand I ordered to close them in 1370.Above the entrance door there is a panel of tiles illustrating the coat of arm of Portugal. On the cornice of the hermitage there is a bas-relief from limestone which is the replica of the original one of 14th century. It's depicting Virgin of Nazar√© with the Child in the arms, St. Br√°s and St. Bartholomew on the right, and D.Rodrigo and monk Romano on the left. The original bas-relief is in the Rector Luis Nesi Museum functioning under the Sanctuary. The facade of the Chapel opposite to the beach Nazar√© is decorated with the panel of tiles, illustrating episodes from the legend. = Interior = The interior part of the Hermitage is decorated with tiles of 17th century. Master Ant√≥nio Oliveira Bernardes added tiles of single figure and several Marian symbols. There are two floors inside the Hermitage linked with 6 steps stair made from lioz. The lower floor is lighted with the small window which is illuminating the place of the original statue. In the vault of the crypt, there is a tile panel illustrating the miracle about how Our Lady of Nazar√© saved Knight D.Fuas Roupinho. On both sides of entrance there are two inscription scraped on the lioz wall. The inscription on the right is composed of the text by Monk Bernardo de Brito, transcribed from the \\"Monarquia Lusitana\\" in Latin, referring to Our Lady of Nazar√© and to the origin of its cult in these places. The second inscription is the translation of the first one. The image of Our Lady of the Conception was removed from the altar and is being kept in the Rector Luis Nesi Museum with the aim to preserve it.

It has been observed to have a very complex tail, which has been suggested to be due to a fast rotation period of the nucleus. The comet orbits the Sun on a 20,000 year orbit, which takes it out about 740 AU (Sun-Earth distances). It was found to differ from typical comets, and was found to be rich in Carbon monoxide (CO) with a blue coma. The blue color is thought to come from the rich amounts of carbon monoxide being ionized. The comet was also noted to be rich in nitrogen. The comet was observed by a submillimeter wavelength telescope in the late 2010s.

He was one of the first Chinese-American millionaires and at one time, according to Time Magazine, was the \\"richest, best-known Chinese business man in the U.S.\\" Though the National Dollar Stores are now closed, Shoong's legacy endures through the organizations, including cultural centers, schools and universities, which he and the Shoong Foundation supported.  Name  Joe Shoong was born as Zhou Song (). Due to the Chinese usage of placing the family name first, Shoong's names were transposed when he emigrated to the U.S. and his given name, Song (changed slightly to Shoong), became the family name he used in America. Song means \\"big and tall mountain\\".  Early years  Joe Shoong's childhood home in Long Tau Wan, China Shoong was born to Joe Gon Lim and Chew Wong Shee in the village of Long Tau Wan () in Zhongshan, Guangdong, China. In that village, the Long Du dialect was spoken so that is most likely the dialect spoken by Shoong. Long Du speakers can generally understand Cantonese. According to his daughter Doris, Shoong sold eggs in China when he was young, and emigrated to the United States when he was 18 or 19 years old (1897 or 1898), without any relatives. From 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act was in force, allowing only three categories of Chinese immigrants to America: merchants, students and diplomats. Shoong's first place of residence in America was Vallejo, California, where he lived with friends and relatives from Long Tau Wan and worked in a garment factory.  National Dollar Stores  In 1901, Shoong opened a store in Vallejo called Sang Lee Dry Goods together with Hon Chui Choy, Doh DohWing and a fourth unknown person. Two years later, he bought out his partners and moved the store to Fillmore Street in San Francisco. In 1905, he changed the name to China Toggery, or Chung Hing in Chinese, meaning \\"revival\\" or \\"rejuvenation\\", and moved the headquarters to 927-929 Market Street. The stores sold clothes and household goods: quality merchandise offered at low prices. Shoong changed the name to the National Dollar Stores in 1928, when there were sixteen store locations in the West, in cities such as Sacramento, Seattle, and Portland. The National Dollar Stores were unusual because the majority ownership and all management was Chinese, and about 90% of the clerks were Caucasian. Shoong helped a great number of Chinese people, many from his own Long Du district, come to America and provided them and their families with housing and education. In 1938, the National Dollar Stores were part of a labor dispute in which the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union picketed three San Francisco stores and a factory supplying the stores. Subsequently, Shoong filed for $500,000 damages and the suit was settled, though the factory then went out of business. Covering Hawaii and seven western states, by 1959 there were fifty-four stores worth $12 million, with 700 employees. After Shoong's death in 1961, the store leadership was taken over by his son, Milton, and the chain went into slow decline. The stores were hurt by the recession of the early 1990s, competition from national discount chains, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots in which eleven stores were damaged. In February 1996, ninety- five years after the opening of Shoong's first store, the National Dollar Stores closed.  Other business interests  Shoong invested in real estate and in the stock market, and kept a ticker tape in his bedroom. Just before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Shoong was traveling across the country by train and had a premonition to sell all of his portfolio. At each train stop, he ordered his broker to sell off his stock, and in the end he received a check from the Bank of America for his portfolio value of a million dollars Around 1926, Shoong bought 51% of the stock of the National Store Company, thus acquiring a controlling interest in Reeves Shoe Stores, a chain of 32 shops on the West Coast. The New York Times included Shoong in a 1938 article on the highest salaries across the nation. The list was topped by movie producer Louis B. Mayer with his compensation of $1,296,503. The California section shows Shoong earning $75,749 with the National Dollar Stores, and a \\"Joe Schoong\\" receiving $50,030 from \\"Schoong Investment Company\\". There was a Shoong Investment Company and this is most likely an typographical error. Other notable names in California included William Randolph Hearst ($500,000 income), Charles Chaplin ($106,000) and Walter E. Disney ($39,750).  Political views and affiliations  Poster at Zhongshan Museum featuring Joe Shoong (top left) Like many Chinese emigrants, Shoong kept close ties with his homeland. He donated 120,000 yuan to support China during the Second Sino- Japanese War, and at his home he entertained Chinese political leader Chiang Kai-shek. Shoong was a Shriner and 32nd degree Mason.  Philanthropy  Poster at Joe Shoong School, Long Tau Wan, China Shoong himself had little formal education, and it was notable that he spoke English with no accent. He believed that education was empowering; thus, a large part of his philanthropy was dedicated to Chinese language schools, cultural institutions and scholarships. In 1928 Shoong gave the money to start a school in his native village in China, Long Tau Wan, as well as a kindergarten named after his wife Rose, and he supported the Longdu Middle School nearby.

They had two daughters, Betty and Doris, and one son, Milton, and moved from San Francisco to Oakland around 1924 to a house designed by Julia Morgan, the first female architect licensed in California. In 1952, a year after Rose's death, Shoong married Ruth Chow. Shoong was ill from January 1961 and died a few months later, on 13 April at the age of 81. The National Dollar Stores closed for one day in his honor. He is buried at Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland. Milton Shoong took over the management of the National Dollar Stores and the Shoong Foundation after his father's death. In 2011, Shoong's daughter Doris Shoong Lee, together with her husband Ted, donated $15 million to the UNLV College of Business, which is now called the Lee Business School.

It is commonly known as the stiff-footed sea cucumber or white sea cucumber, and occurs on rocky coasts in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Description Eupentacta quinquesemita can grow to a length of up to . The tube feet are arranged in four longitudinal rows; they are non-retractable and give the animal a spiny appearance. The skin between the tube feet is smooth, but both body wall and tube feet contain calcareous ossicles that make them stiff. The mouth is surrounded by ten branched feeding tentacles, the two lowest ones being smaller than the rest. The general body colour is white, the tentacles (often the only parts of the animal that are visible) being creamy-white, often with yellowish or pinkish bases. Bits of shell or other fragments often adhere to the tube feet. Distribution and habitat E. quinquesemita is found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, its range extending from Alaska to California. It is found on rocky shores in low intertidal and shallow subtidal zones, where it tends to hide itself in crevices and under boulders. It is common among harbour installations, pilings and floats, especially where there is vigorous water movement. Larvae often settle in locations with strong currents among hydroids and algae. Ecology A deposit and suspension feeder, E. quinquesemita uses its feeding tentacles to push material into its mouth, extracting the edible material and eliminating the unwanted debris. The larvae of a parasitic snail, Thyonicola americana, enter in this way and develop into adults which invade the viscera while maintaining a connection to the gut lumen to release offspring. The sea cucumber is preyed on by several species of starfish, such as Solaster stimpsoni, Pycnopodia helianthoides and Leptasterias hexactis, and fish such as the kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus). This sea cucumber exhibits a seasonal pattern of evisceration, expelling its guts in the autumn and growing a new set in the spring, resulting in a high proportion of T. americana parasites not completing their life cycle, but not all individuals do this. Breeding takes place between March and May, females liberating large, yolky eggs into the sea where they are fertilised by sperm produced by the males. The larvae are well-ciliated but do not feed, developing their calcareous armour in about a fortnight before settling.

Biography William Hamilton Mitchell Acton was born on 16 August 1906, the son of Arthur Acton (1873‚Äì1953), an art collector and dealer, and Hortense Lenore Mitchell (1871‚Äì1962), the heiress of John J. Mitchell, President of the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank. Harold Acton was his older brother. He attended Chateau de Lancy, Geneva, and Eton College; at Eton his contemporaries were Robert Byron, Brian Howard, Alfred Duggan and Anthony Powell, who remembers William fondly in his memoirs. In 1922 a reproduction of his painting, Nature Morte, appeared in the Eton Candle. At Eton he was among the founders of the Eton Society of Arts in February 1922 with Brian Howard, Henry Yorke, his brother Harold, Robert Byron, Alan Clutton-Brock, Hugh Lygon, Anthony Powell and Colin Anderson. Cimitero Evangelico agli Allori In 1925 Acton moved to Christ Church, Oxford, with many of his friends, but remained for only one year. Brian Howard wrote a satirical profile of William Acton in his Continuation of Oxford Portraits of 1925-6 which appeared in the Cherwell. Other profiles were: David Herbert, Mark Ogilvie-Grant, Ren√© Crevel, Henry Thynne, 6th Marquess of Bath and Charles Plumb. In the previous issue the profiles had been Robert Byron, Harold Acton, John Sutro, Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne, Edward Henry Charles James Fox-Strangways, 7th Earl of Ilchester. At Oxford William Acton's friends were Hugh Lygon, Robert Byron, Brian Howard, Michael Parsons, David Plunket Greene, Roy Harrod, Evelyn Waugh and John Sutro. After college the Acton brothers were part of a circle including Diana Mitford and her first husband, Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne, John Betjeman, Roy Harrod, Henry Yorke and his wife, Robert Byron, Evelyn Waugh, Randolph Churchill and Diana Churchill. William Acton sketched the Mitford sisters. Not long after being demobilised from the Pioneer Corps during World War II, William Acton died on 31 August 1945 after a short illness and is buried with his family at Cimitero degli Allori.

Life Born in Flanders, Violet was an artist in Lille, moving to Paris in 1782. He left Paris during the French Revolution, but not before etching portraits of some of the members of the National Assembly in 1789. In that or the following year he settled in London, and in 1790 he exhibited 11 miniatures at the Royal Academy, among them being a portrait of Marie-Antoinette. He continued to exhibit miniatures. Violet died at 1 Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, London, on 9 December 1819. Works Violet from 1798 showed drawings of domestic and fancy subjects at the Royal Academy, every year from 1798 to 1819. His portraits of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, 1790, and George, Prince of Wales, 1791, and other works, were engraved by Francesco Bartolozzi. Other portraits engraved from Violet's miniatures are those Hester Piozzi by Marino Bovi, and Gaetano Bartolozzi by Thomas Tomkins. A set of etchings of domestic subjects, worked over in stipple by Violet, was published by Moltens in 1810. Before Violet left France, he published a treatise on miniature-painting, Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de l'art de peindre en miniature (1788). A supplement, containing the author's portrait, was published at Rome in 1788, and the treatise was translated into German in 1795. Family Pierre-No√´l Violet, 1803 portrait of his daughter Maria By 1771, Violet had married Marguerite Becret. They had daughters, Maria (1794‚Äì1868) who married James Brook Pulham (1791‚Äì1860), an India House clerk and artist, and exhibited at the Royal Academy; and Cecilia (1797‚Äì1880) who married Louis Ferri√®re.

Biography Haris Vrondos was born in 1951 in Vytina. In 1963 he started studying guitar in the Lefkada music school. Later, he would move to Athens and take piano lessons Eleni Zioga. At the same time he would also follow the seminars of G√ºnter Becker about electronic music, that would result in the actual start of his career as a composer. The lessons of G.A. Papaioannou on counterpoint will complete his musical education. He worked as a columnist and musical critic for the Greek newspaper Rizospastis from 1974 to 1976, continuing to write also on the Greek magazines Tipo, Mousiki, To Dentro, Kritiki kai Keimena, High Lights. Beyond these writings he also published four books containing essays and texts about music. In 1982 he started to collaborate with the Greek National Radio (with the First Programme and the Third Programme) for the presentation and the production of musical and musicological transmissions. In 28 years of collaboration with the Hellenic Radio he reached over 3000 hours of broadcasting. In 1983, together with other artists, they founded the magazine Nisos that printed musical cassettes with the music and the poetry of the artists affiliated to the journal. The action of the group was enriched by the many shows and recitals that they were doing in the city of Athens and in the close cities. His relevance in the Greek musical scene brought him to be member of the board of the Union of the Greek Composers (from 1987 to 1990). Musical career His work can be divided into three periods: 1\\\\. 1969-80: a period that comprehends the amateur phase and the experimentation. It includes the works from ŒëœÖœÑŒøŒ∫œÑŒøŒΩŒØŒµœÇ (1969) until ŒúŒøŒΩœåŒªŒøŒ≥Œø (1981). 2\\\\. 1982-86: this period is characterised by works of mixed nature (Proti Simfonia, 1982, Mavri Mousiki, 1985, and Deuteri Simfonia, 1986) and stylistically emphasises the end of romanticism through elements of modernism. 3\\\\. 1986 until present: this period is marked by the compositions of the operas: ŒüŒπ ŒîŒ±ŒπŒºŒøŒΩŒπœÉŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøŒπ (The Possessed), ŒëŒªŒ∫ŒπŒ≤ŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ∑œÇ (Alcibiades), Œ°Œ≠Œ∫Œ≤ŒπŒµŒº ŒëœáŒºŒ¨œÑŒøŒ≤Œ± (Requiem), Œó ŒîŒØŒ∫Œ∑ (The Trial), ŒôŒ¥Œ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ Œ±œÖœÑœåœáŒµŒπœÅŒµœÇ (Idanikoi Autoxeires) and the cantata ŒôŒøœÖŒªŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ Œø Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ (Julian The Apostate). In this last period Vrondos searches for his personal style. Xaris Vrondos has composed music for associations like The Athens Concert Hall Association, ALEA III, the University of Boston, the Greek Ballet, the Union of Greek Composers, the Municipality of Thessaloniki and the Paris-Sorbonne University. He also made live concerts with his works of chamber music (Œ†œÅŒøŒøŒ¥ŒµœÖœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ Œ£œçŒΩŒ¥ŒµœÉŒºŒøœÇ Œ•ŒºŒ∑œÑœÑŒøœç, 1980 - Œ©Œ¥ŒµŒØŒø Athenaeum, 1995 - ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ†ŒπŒΩŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒ∏ŒÆŒ∫Œ∑, 1996 - ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒµŒØŒø ŒúœÄŒµŒΩŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑, 2002 Œ∫Œ±Œπ 2006), whereas also his soloist and orchestral works have been played in Greece and Abroad.

It is the 18th overall episode of the series and is written by David Quandt and directed by Tucker Gates. It aired on Fox in the United States on February 25, 2014. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Peralta and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Peralta is notified that his apartment is going through new rules and must pay additional money if he wants to keep it. Meanwhile, Holt conducts interrogatories for each detective. The episode was seen by an estimated 2.66 million household viewers and gained a 1.3/3 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Andy Samberg's performance and the writing. Plot Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) learns that his grandmother's apartment where he has been living is going co-op, and he will have to pay nearly a half million dollars to keep living there. He goes to a loan shark for a down payment, before Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti) convinces him to search for a new apartment instead. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) starts collecting self-evaluations from the detectives, leading to much stress within the department, especially for Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) and Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) take revenge on unhygienic co-worker Lohank (Matt Walsh) who uses Rosa's desk on a different shift, until feeling sympathy for him after he tells them details about his personal life. Reception=Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"The Apartment\\" was seen by an estimated 2.66 million household viewers and gained a 1.3/3 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was an 8% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 2.88 million viewers with a 1.2/3 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 1.3 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Glee but behind New Girl, fifth on its timeslot and tenth for the night, behind New Girl, Person of Interest, Chicago Fire, a rerun of Growing Up Fisher, NCIS: Los Angeles, a rerun of About a Boy, The Bachelor, NCIS, and The Voice. =Critical reviews= \\"The Apartment\\" received positive reviews from critics. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.8 out of 10 and wrote, \\"'The Apartment' gave each of the characters an opportunity to grow, while staying true to what we've know of them. Mixing up the pairings always yields interesting results, and there was something appealing about the idea that Jake's childhood muck-up buddy Gina has somehow sailed past him on the maturity barometer. I don't know what the world would look like with a Hitchcock sans a Scully, though.\\" Molly Eichel of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Maybe the Gina fluctuations wouldn't have been as noticeable if the other characters hadn‚Äôt participated in plots that only highlighted their already well-worn tropes. Brooklyn Nine-Nine has eschewed the natural fallback of police work that characterized the season's earlier episodes to instead focus on the inter-office relationships of its characters. These plots could have really happened on any other show.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"'The Apartment' tried to pull off a trick the show tried earlier in the season in 'Pontiac Bandit,' by giving one of the characters a relationship with Jake that preceded their assignment to this precinct. That time, it was Peralta and Diaz as police academy classmates; here, it's that Jake and Gina are such close friends dating back to childhood that Jake got her the job as a department aide.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2014 American television episodes Brooklyn Nine- Nine (season 1) episodes ","title":"The Apartment (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)"},{"id":"56369258","text":"Tiberi is a surname.

He first came to prominence as a member of the Ballets Russes. Later he worked with various ballet companies, e.g., Pavlova, de Basil, de Valois, Ballet Polonaise, Massine, the London Festival, the Royal Flemish. Career in ballet Born in Warsaw, Woizikovsky trained in dance at its Teatr Wielki, and with Enrico Cecchetti. He became known as a character dancer.Reynolds and McCormick (2003), p.55 (character). His youthful career flourished with Ballet Russes. He and dance partner Lydia Sokolova were eventually married. The very popular and innovative company performed cutting-edge choreographies by Fokine, Nijinsky, Massine, Nijinska, and Balanchine. Unfortunately, Diaghilev died in 1929 and his company folded. Thereafter, Woizikovsky's dance work often involved the repertoire of Ballets Russes. For various companies he also served as ballet master, and wrote choreography.Koegler (1977), p.574 \\"Woizikovsky\\" (training). =Diaghilev's Ballets Russes= In 1916 in Lausanne he joined Sergei Diaghilev's company Ballets Russes. Apparently, Diaghilev's Polish secretary on a recruiting assignment had found several dancers including the sixteen- year-old Woizikovsky.Massine (1968), pp. 65-66, 72; called 'Woidzikowsky' here. In the difficult circumstances of war-time Europe, the company took to the road in order to perform. Traveling twice to America, it included the world famous Vaslav Nijinsky.Shead (1989), pp. 81-84, (tours), p.81 Woizikovsky joins Ballets Russes, first American tour; p.83 he remains with Diaghilev during the second to America led by Nijinsky. In a group that went to Spain with Diaghilev, Woizikovsky studied there flamenco and Spanish dance.Paris & Bayo,Massine (1968). Leonid Massine was then the company's choreographer. In his ballets Woizikovsky performed, starting with Les Meninas in 1916, and in 1917 Parade and Contes Russes. That year also Woizikovsky in Les Femmes de bonne humeur masterfully played a dinner waiter who mimed the dishes ordered, e.g., spaghetti. In 1919 in La Boutique Fantasque he danced the tarantella with Lydia Sokolova,Sokolova (1960), p.99 (his mime performance she called \\"a masterpiece\\"), and pp. 134, 138 (the tarantella). and in Le Tricorne he played the Miller (with Sokolova as the Miller's wife); later he played the Corregidor.Balanchine (1954), pp. 403 and 404 per Le Tricorne.Sokolova (1989), p. (quote). In 1920: Massine's Le Astuzie and Pulcinella. In 1921 he took the part of 'the Negro' in the ballet Scheherazade, a part famously danced earlier by Vaslav Nijinsky, and latter by Massine.Shead (1989).Sokolova (1960), pp. 56-57.Cf. Massine (1968).Paris & Bayo: Massine's ballets in 1916-1920. In 1921 Bronislava Nijinska became the company's choreographer. Woizikovsky performed in the 'Three Ivans', designed by Nijinska, added to the 1921 production of Petipa's The Sleeping Princess.Sokolova (1989), p.92. Woizikovsky was in the production of her iconic Les Noces in 1923. The following year he played roles in Les Biches (as one of the two Athletes) and in Le Train bleu (as the Golfer).Baer (1986), pp. 32-36 (Noces), 38-40 (Biches), 41-44 (Train bleu); pp. 74-75 per Woizikovsky.Stravinsky (1936), p.176 re Nijinska's ballets: Woizikovsky. The Golfer role was \\"a pipe-smoking playboy, based on Edward, Prince of Wales\\".Garafola (2005), p.385 (quote). Lydia Sokolova later wrote about Woizikovsky's performance in the 'beach ballet' that was Le Train Bleu: > \\"Leon discovered me in a bathing hut\\" and removed [her] wrap. He \\"took a > good look at me, put his pipe in his pocket, and danced with me the famous > Train bleu waltz. He had to throw me up spinning in the air, then catch me > as I came down.\\" It was difficult \\"because my woollen costume was impossible > to grip\\".Sokolova (1960), pp. 221-222 (quote). For the choreographer George Balanchine, newly arrived from Russia, and also for Massine who had returned to the company, Woizikovsky got ballet roles, e.g., in Balanchine's Prodigal Son of 1929 (as a companion to the son).Balanchine (1954), p.293 (Prodigal Son), p.447 (Woizikovsky per list of 'principal male dancers' for Ballets Russes).Garafola (1989), pp. 376 (as one of a half-dozen ballet \\"stars\\" to survive the company's demise in 1929), 405-415 (his roles re Ballets Russes). When Diaghilev died in 1929, his Ballets Russes company disbanded.Koegler (1977), pp. 50-51 \\"Ballets Russes\\".W ballet: Pulcinellas 152 w/M, Les Mantelots 234, Tricorne 142, 176^, Cleopatra 172 + replace Massine, Massine 143, 174; M's company [?]  143 LS, 175-76; LS+LW 153 // SACRE 159-168, 166-167, 181-3, Music 160, #166 LS 178 // LW: injuries 177-178 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\+// S 164 VS 159, L167,173 VS. =Other companies, positions= Woizikovsky was thirty when Diaghilev died in 1929. That year he managed to join Pavlova's ballet company, which was often on tour. It turned out to be the very last years of this famous traveling dance ensemble. At The Hague in 1931 the world renowned Anna Pavlova suddenly died at the age of forty-nine.Koegler (1977), pp. 574, 407. Woizikovsky then signed with the new company Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. It'd been formed by Ren√© Blum and Wassily de Basil in order to continue the project started by the late Diaghilev. Many of his former dancers had been recruited, and also his choreographers Balanchine and Massine. In 1932 Woizikovsky danced with Irina Baronova in Jeux d'Enfants, with designs by Henri Matisse. A dispute unfortunately arose between him and Massine, the source of contention being performance roles, especially for Le Tricorne. As a result, he left the company in 1934.Garc√≠a-M√°rquez (1990), pp. 6-7 (joins company); pp. 110-111, 150 (leaves company re dispute with Massine).Cf. Balanchine (1954), pp. 404, 477.Shead (1989), p. 180 (photo with Baronova), p.182 (joins company). During the early 1930s, along with other Ballets Russes dancers (Karsavina, Idzikowski, Lopokova, Spessivtseva), he worked with the Vic-Wells company of Ninette de Valois in London. These well-known performers then provided \\"some legitimacy\\" to her nascent ballet company, which evolved to become The Royal Ballet.Reynolds and McCormick (2003), p.183 (quote re de Valois).Cf. Garafola (1989), p.332. In 1934 he formed his own company, Les Ballets de Leon Woizikovsky. His dancers included Blinova, Tarakanova, Raievska, Froman, Eglevsky, Youskevitch, and Sokolova. For the company he choreographed two ballets, Port Said (music by K. Konstantinov) and L'Amour sorrier (de Falla). In 1935 and 1936 the company visited London and Paris.Garc√≠a-M√°rquez (1990), p.150 (company, dancers, ballets, visits); p. 155 (his two ballets later in the repertoire of de Basil's company).Koegler (1977), p.574 (Woizikovsky's company). As the \\"ballet master and leading male dancer\\" Woizikovsky joined Wassily de Basil's company at Covent Garden. On a 62-member tour to Australia in 1936, the company opened in Adelaide where their dance arts became \\"a revelation\\". They \\"created a furor, the final performance climaxing with a fifteen-minute ovation.\\" Further stops in Australia and New Zealand similarly inspired the public, which knew little first-hand of Diaghilev's ballet repertoire. Yet company's top management (the owner's rep and the attorney) quarreled and split. This eventually led to the rise of \\"artistic differences\\" between Jan Hoyer the r√©gisseur (stage manager) and Woizikovsky. In turn the company's dancers then divided into two opposing groups. Yet outsiders, apparently, were little aware.Garc√≠a-M√°rquez (1990), pp. 154-155 (the company, in Adelaide), 156 (the split in management). In 1938 Woizikovsky succeeded Bronislava Nijinska as director of the recently-formed state-sponsored Ballet Polonais in Warsaw. He led the company to the 1939 World's Fair in New York City. Yet when the company arrived back home in Poland, both Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia were about to invade, starting World War II.Reynolds and McCormick (2003), p.181 (Ballet Polonaise).Cf., Baer (1986), p.66. He managed to escape, rejoining Ballets Russes de Colonel W. de Basil in France. This company spent most of the next six years of war touring in the Americas.Cf. Garc√≠a-M√°rquez (1990), p.284 (the Americas). In 1945 Woizikovsky returned to devastated Warsaw. There he began to teach dance at the Opera school of Teatr Wielki (Grand Theater).Koegler (1977), p.574 (Woizikovsky: de Basil, return to Warsaw). =Latter years= In London Woizikovsky choreographed several ballets, staging his Petrushka in 1958 and his Sheherazade in 1960. These productions were for the London Festival Ballet, which he later served as ballet master. From time to time he staged other Diaghilev-era ballets, e.g., for the Cologne Ballet and for the Royal Flemish Ballet. He was ballet master for Massine's Ballet Europeo, e.g., at the 1960 Festival of Ballet in Genoa.Massine (1968), pp. 258, 262-263. He aided in the reconstruction of Nijinska's choreography for Le Train Bleu.Garafola (2005), p.385. Until the mid-1960s he was teaching at the Cologne Institute for Theatre Dance, and until 1974 at Bonn University. Then he returned to Warsaw.Koegler (1977), pp. 126-127 (Cologne), 329-330 (London Festival Ballet), 574 (Woizikovsky). Lydia Sokolova=The relationship= British ballerina Lydia Sokolova (she had taken a Russian name) and Woizikovsky were both dancers in Ballet Russes, she from 1913 and he from 1916. In 1919 despite each being attached to another, they fell in love. In their dancing, they had sometimes been paired for performances, winning acclaim. In love, they began secretly to write to each other. Eventually, this uneasy situation was found out. It led to public confrontations, involving their alienated spouses (both dancers in the company) and each other. Diaghilev voiced his early disapproval. Sokolova had become elated, then fell woefully depressed.Sokolova (1960, 1989), they fall in love (pp. 149, 150, 154, 173); possessive husband (71, 79, [94], 149, 168, 169); writing letters (148, 149, 154, 155); paired in ballet: tarantella (134, 138, 148), acclaim (153),Tricorne (142, 175-176), Cl√©op√¢tre (172); Diaghilev (154, 156, 158, 159); physical confrontations (157-158, 173, 174); Sokolova (148, 155-156, 178); plans (149, 173, 184); honeymoon (208). Nonetheless, the relationship endured its troubles, and bloomed, leading to their marriage.Garafola (1989), p.233 (Sokolova and Woizikovsky). The two then thrived for a time, sharing their lives as principal dancers in Ballets Russes, and briefly in other dance companies. Much later Sokolova would write, \\"If only he had resisted gambling, we might have been so happy.\\" In 1929 on vacation in the south of France, at Le Lavandou, Lydia opened a newspaper carrying news of the sudden death in Venice of Sergei Diaghilev. Voicing her sorrow, she showed it to Leon. > \\"As the awful truth sank into my consciousness, my knees gave way... . When > I looked up at last Leon was gone. Then I saw him in the distance walking > along the edge of the sea, kicking the water with his foot.\\"Sokolova (1960, > 1989), p.241 (\\"If only\\" quote); re his gambling: pp. 211, 217, 227, 241, > 257, 263. Diaghilev's death: pp. 279-280, quote at 280 [end of her book of > memoirs]. =Her observations= Sokolova remembered that she and Woizikovsky performed a certain pas de deux, a piece which in rehearsal \\"we enjoyed dancing though we did not think it anything special\\". Yet when their performance of it finished \\"the applause was thunderous\\". They took an \\"embarrassing\\" number of curtain calls. Sokolova describes Woizikovsky as \\"never an actor, his talent was for genuine dancing\\". He had \\"a phenomenal photographic mind\\" which, e.g., allowed him to commit to memory pages of dance notations for Le Sacre Du Primtemps. When Leon was in his early-twenties, she writes, Diaghilev offered him an opportunity to try choreography, but it was too early in his career.Sokolova (1960, 1989), pp. 153 (pas de deus, quote), 57 (dancer not actor), 161 (his memory), 177 (choreography). In an episode circa 1924, two dancers wanted to strike for a raise in salary against Diaghilev and Ballets Russes. Yet no other dancer quite agreed with them; the strike failed. The dancers then decided that after the night's performance: > \\"[A] small deputation should address Diaghilev... and Leon being the > universal comrade was chosen to lead it. Diaghilev sauntered toward the > group with a face of thunder. Leon went up to him and tried to put the > dancers' point of view in some detail. After listening to him in silence, > Diaghilev said, 'Leon, where are your friends?' When Leon looked around, > there was not a soul in sight.\\"Sokolova (1989), p.228 (the failed strike, > and Leon). The two 'ringleaders' were sacked. Diaghilev told Leon: \\"If you > have a grievance come and see me privately.\\"Earlier, about 1919, Diaghilev > had given both Lydia and Leon a raise. Yet Ballets Russes was chronically > short of cash, and broke after its financial disaster of 1921-1922: The > Sleeping Princess. The next year both were idle, unpaid, and starving; they > sued Diaghilev for unpaid compensation and won. Diaghilev paid. Shortly > thereafter they signed a new contract with him, both getting raises. > Sokolova (1989), p.183 (raise c.1919), pp. 200-201 (disaster, lawsuit, new > contract). Circa 1916 at Fontarrabia on the north coast of Spain near the French border, Sokolova was there when Leon saved a life, \\"Tariat, a French boy we had in the company, from drowning in a rough sea\\". Soon after another memorable event occurred. A small entourage of the dance company had an audience with the King and Queen of Spain. In the royal presence Leon accidentally kicked open a \\"huge backgammon box\\" sending its \\"discs spinning and rattling in every direction\\" as Diaghilev looked on.Sokolova (1960, 1989), pp. 83 (saves Tariat), 84-85 (backgammon).

It can be viewed with the naked eye, with the components having a combined apparent visual magnitude of 5.07. An annual parallax shift of 42.64 mas provides a distance estimate of 46.5 light years. The system is moving further from the Sun with a radial velocity of +3.76 km/s. This is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system consisting of two similar components designated Aa and Ab. The initial orbital elements were determined by Abt and Levy (1976), giving an orbital period of 13.8 days. In Boden et al. (1999), the full set of orbital elements were derived using measurements with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer. Nadal et al. (1979) suggested that some variation in the measurements may be caused by a third component in the system, but this was not supported by the results from Boden et al. (1999). In 2005, Maciej Konacki pioneered a new technique for accurately determining the radial velocity of a double-lined binary system, which allowed the elements to be further refined. This yielded an orbital period of 13.82449 days, an eccentricity of 0.2366, and an angular semimajor axis of 6.55 mas. Both stars in this system have a spectrum matching a stellar classification of F8 V, indicating they are ordinary F-type main-sequence stars that are generating energy via hydrogen fusion at their cores. The orbital measurements of this system allows the masses of the two stars to be determined accurately: the primary component has 1.22 times the mass of the Sun while the secondary has 1.17 times the Sun's mass. Both stars are larger and brighter than the Sun, with higher temperature photospheres ‚àí having effective temperatures of around 6,200 K compared to 5,772 K for the Sun. The age of the system is estimated as 6.8 billion years and they have a similar element abundance as the Sun. In 2010, the system was identified as a debris disk candidate based upon the detection of an infrared excess at a wavelength of 24 Œºm. This dust has a mean temperature of 300 K and is orbiting at a radius of 1.7 AU, compared to a projected linear separation of 0.23 AU for the components. The Washington Double Star Catalog lists two additional visual components. Component B is a magnitude 12.6 star at an angular separation of 77 arcseconds from the primary system. Component C is magnitude 13.0 and is located 71 arcseconds away. It is unknown if either is gravitationally bound to 64 Piscium Aab, but if they are then the projected separations are about 1,800 AU with an orbital period of around 50,000 years.

Finally captured, he was arrested on January 6, 1929.  Desertion  On October 17, 1915, in time of World War I, the rifleman Mohamed Mechkarini, of the , then in garrison with Miliana, left his body carrying some military effects. Mohamed Mechkarini had joined a group of Algerian soldiers in the garrison of Miliana, with his friend Zemmouri Ben Kada, to operate a massive desertion of the ranks of the French army to begin the preparation for a rebellion independence in Algeria. Mechkarini followed in his journey the epic of the resistants Mohand Sa√Ød Abdoun and . Volunteered in 1914, his colleague Zemmouri Ben Kada, after the regulatory instruction, was directed in France on the front, and on May 24, 1915, being sentinel to one of the listening posts, his company, the 10th, being on duty, he passed to the enemy, carrying his weapons with one of his comrades named Sellaf. These facts soon became known to the Regiment depot at Miliana, where it was noted. Mohamed Mechkarini, having learned of the desertion of his friend Zemmouri, he prepared for five months his departure from the barrenison before performing his action on October 17, 1915. Having been taken prisoner in Germany, Zemmouri soon suffered the effects of the propaganda which was made in the native prison camps for the recruitment of the Turkish army, and consented to serve in the enemy ranks. However, Zemmouri returned to his depot at Miliana on January 25, 1920, and was demobilized on March 4, without being disturbed. Shortly after his liberation, Zemmouri, probably believing that everything was forgotten, had the unfortunate idea to give sign of life. He came to the depot of his former regiment to demand a payback, arguing that his former prisoner and wounded. Searches were made and notes about him reappeared. Zemmouri was arrested and prosecuted. He confessed to the facts after initially indicating that he had been injured during a patrol and taken prisoner. The war council of Algiers, presided over by Colonel Nicolas Delin, colonel of the gendarmerie, ruled on February 1, 1921 this tirailleur of the , garrisoned Miliana, named Zemmouri Ben Kada, charged with desertion to the enemy. At the hearing, at the end of the trial, the accused made inappropriate assessments of the skirmisher regiments. Zemmouri was tried according to the Code of Military Justice for the Army, following articles 235 to 239 relating to desertion abroad and desertion to the enemy. The Algiers Military Council sentenced him to death. During the meeting, Captain Boutet was the government commissioner, while the defense of Zemmouri was provided by the lawyer Emile Morinaud.  Arrest  After rolling his hump everywhere, Mohamed Mechkarini was arrested January 6, 1929 by the gendarmerie of Th√©nia.  Judicial process  The military tribunal of Algiers, under the presidency of Councilor Collin, had judged the case of Mohamed Mechkarini for his desertion in time of war. He was tried according to the Code of Military Justice for the Army, following articles 231 to 234 on desertion within the country. In court, Mechkarini says he deserted not for fear of fighting, but as a result of ill-treatment of one of his sergeants. This statement is recognized as erroneous, and the deserter is sentenced to three years in prison. His defense was provided by the lawyer Naudin.

Founding After the federal government announced recreational use of cannabis would be legalized in 2017 or early 2018, then Premier Kathleen Wynne commented the LCBO stores might be the ideal distribution network for stocking, controlling and selling such products. The Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU), which represents LCBO staff, also lobbied for the LCBO to have a monopoly on cannabis sales. In response to the federal Task Force on Marijuana Legalization and Regulation recommendation against selling cannabis in conjunction with alcohol, in September 2017, the Ontario government announced the LCBO would be the sole vendor of recreational marijuana to the public in that province, but not through the 651 stores that sell alcoholic beverages. A new Crown corporation, the Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation (OCRC), was established as a subsidiary of the LCBO with a mandate to initially open 40 stores before legalization took effect in October 2018. OCRC also entered a partnership with Shopify to use the company's platform for operating the province's online cannabis sales. In March 2018, OCRC adopted the trading name Ontario Cannabis Store for its retail services. The OCS logo, designed by a Canadian subsidiary of Leo Burnett Worldwide as part of a $650,000 marketing and branding contract, was derided as \\"boring\\" and \\"underwhelming\\". Change in mandate Following the 2018 provincial election, the new provincial government led by Premier Doug Ford announced the OCRC would not be opening physical stores and that cannabis sales in Ontario would instead be conducted by private stores. Under this new model, the OCRC continues to operate the provincial online cannabis sales service and serves as the wholesale supplier for private stores in Ontario. The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario is responsible for the regulation and licensing of private cannabis stores in province. The OCRC was also reorganized to operate directly under the Ministry of Finance rather than as a subsidiary of the LCBO. =Brick-and-mortar stores= Because of a cap on the number of retail outlets - operated by private enterprise - permits to operate cannabis stores were based on a lottery system. Only 25 licences were issued initially, and another 50 were subsequently awarded. (The government continued to operate the on-line sales business via its Ontario Cannabis Store site.) Ontario removing cap on number of pot shops, opening up market for retailers Ontario Attorney General Doug Downey announced in December 2019 that by April 2020, the lottery, and the cap on the number of licenses, would both be eliminated. Some 20 new ones would be issued per month.Ontario will scrap lottery system, move to expand retail cannabis market in 2020 The intent was to increase the number of retail outlets in the province, and to make up for the stores which had already closed.Here's what scrapping the Ontario cannabis retail lottery means for London in 2020 Increasing the supply was expected to help \\"combat the illicit market\\". The black market remained persistent, according to an October 2019 report, partly because of a lack of retail outlets in many communities and because of the lower prices charged of illicit product: 35% lower on a Canada-wide basis.

Incisor root resorptions due to ectopic maxillary canines imaged by computerized tomography: a comparative study in extracted teeth.

Early treatment of palatally erupting maxillary canines by extraction of the primary canines. Eur J Orthod. 1988 Nov;10(4):283-95. While maxillary canines can also be displaced buccally, it is thought this arises as a result of a lack of space. Most of these cases resolve themselves with the permanent canine erupting without intervention.Jacoby H. The etiology of maxillary canine impactions. American Journal of Orthodontics. 1983 Aug;84(2):125-32.  Aetiology  There are two main theories on the aetiology of palatally impacted canines. One is the whereby the cause is thought to be polygenic. There is a high rate of incidence of ectopic canines with dental anomalies such as pegged lateral incisors, missing lateral incisors, delayed eruption, and the absence of crowding.Zilberman Y, Cohen B, Becker A. Familial trends in palatal canines, anomalous lateral incisors, and related phenomena. Eur J Orthod. 1990 May;12(2):135-9.Brin I, Becker A, Shalhav M. Position of the maxillary permanent canine in relation to anomalous or missing lateral incisors: a population study. Eur J Orthod. 1986 Feb;8(1):12-6. A second theory, the , is that the root of the lateral incisor guides the eruption of the canine. Hence, even if the lateral incisor is diminutive or missing because of genetics, local environmental factors ultimately result in the eruption of the canine in an abnormal position.Nanda, R. Esthetics and biomechanics in Orthodontics, 2nd ed. St Louis: Elsevier Inc; 2015. 122 p.

Maxillary ectopic canines can result in the resorption of central incisors in 15% of cases, and lateral incisors in 34% of cases.Ericson, S. Bjerklin, K. Falahat, B.

Although thought to be rare, there could also be cystic changes occurring in the crown of the ectopic canine. Hence if not diagnosed early, treatment could be complicated / extended.Shafer WG, Hine MK, Levy BM, Tomich CE. A Textbook of Oral Pathology. Philadelphia (USA); London (UK): Saunders, 1983.  Diagnosis = Clinically = In normal development, canines are typically palpable in the buccal sulcus by ages 10‚Äì11.Ericson S, Kurol J. Radiographic assessment of maxillary canine eruption in children with clinical signs of eruption disturbance. Eur J Orthod. 1986 Aug; 8(3):133‚Äì40 If a primary canine is retained beyond the age of 12 to 13 years, with no signs of mobility and no labial canine bulge, impaction of the permanent canine should be suspected. A radiograph should be taken to confirm the diagnosis.Shapira Y, Kuftinec MM. Early diagnosis and interception of potential maxillary canine impaction. The Journal of the American Dental Association. 1998 Oct; 129(10):1450-4 = Radiographically = However, there is limited use in taking a radiograph before the age of 10-11. To locate the permanent canine, the parallax technique is often used. The parallax technique is done by taking two radiographs in different positions. There could be either a vertical shift or a horizontal shift between the two radiographs. A vertical shift might be done by taking a periapical and an upper anterior occlusal, while a horizontal shift might be done by taking two periapicals with significant horizontal tube shift. An image shift principle is then applied to the two radiographs taken. A useful acronym is the ‚ÄòSLOB‚Äô rule, which stands for ‚Äúsame lingual opposite buccal‚Äù. This means that when looking at the radiographs from e.g. a left to right direction, if the canine has moved in the same direction, then following the ‚Äúsame lingual‚Äù part of the rule, the canine is positioned lingually. There is low evidence base for choosing either preferentially. However, one study suggests that using a horizontal parallax is more accurate than a vertical parallax in locating ectopic canines.Armstrong C, Johnston C, Burden D, Stevenson M. Localizing ectopic maxillary canines‚Äîhorizontal or vertical parallax? Eur J Orthod. 2003 Dec; 25(6):585‚Äì9 An alternative method is the use of CBCT (small field of view). These can also be used to localise ectopic canines three dimensionally.Walker L, Enciso R, Mah J. Three-dimensional localization of maxillary canines with cone-beam computed tomography. Am J of Orthod Dentofacial Orthop. 2005 Oct;128(4):418-23 However, due to the higher dose of ionising radiation, the current British Orthodontic Society Orthodontic Radiographs Guidelines state that there is no justification for the routine usage of CBCT imaging to localise ectopic canines.Isaacson KG, Thom AR, Atack NE, Horner K, Whaites E. Guidelines for the use of Radiographs in Clinical Orthodontics. 4th ed. British Orthodontic Society; 2015 Although the use of CBCT can be effective when conventional imaging fails to localise the ectopic canine, it is recommended that advice should be sought from a Dental /Maxillofacial Radiology Specialist prior to use.SEDENTEXCT.

Treatment / Management = Early Intervention = The extraction of the deciduous canine may encourage the ectopic permanent canine to erupt. This interceptive treatment is recommended for children aged 10‚Äì13 with normal physiological spacing. This is supported by the Royal College of Surgeons England (RCS Eng) guidelines; based primarily on 2 studies: *A case series, with no control groupEricson S, Kurol J.

Eur J Orthod. 2015;37(2):219-29. According to the RSC Eng Guidelines, space maintenance should be considered after the extraction of the deciduous canine. A follow-up radiograph should be taken 12 months after, and if no improvement is reported, an alternative treatment option should be considered. Other interceptive methods primarily involve creating space in the maxilla to allow the palatally-displaced canine to erupt successfully. *Maxillary expansion using rapid maxillary expansion, transpalatal arch, or quadhelix appliancesBaccetti T, Mucedero M, Leonardi M, Cozza P.

It is considered one of the disputed territories of Northern Iraq. The village came to international attention in 2014 through the genocide of Yazidis by the Islamic State.  History  Kocho, like the entire region of Sinjar, is considered to be one of the disputed territories of northern Iraq. According to article 140 of the Iraqi constitution, a referendum should decide on the status of the village and the fate of its inhabitants. Since 2003, the village has been occupied by Kurdish Peshmerga troops, who fled from the village on 2 August 2014. On 3 August 2014, the Islamic State took control over the whole village. On 25 May 2017, Iraqi forces and Yazidi militias liberated the village from ISIS. In March 2019, mass grave exhumations began in Kocho.  Population  The village's population is entirely Yazidi and are mainly farmers.  Massacre of Yazidis from Kocho  On 3 August 2014, the Islamic State committed a genocide against the Yazidis. The massacre occurred because the Kurdish Peshmerga had fled from ISIS and left the Yazidis defenseless. The Islamic State imprisoned Yazidis for 12 days and then gave the Yazidis an ultimatum of three days to convert to Islam or face death. Since the Yazidis refused to convert to Islam, the massacre started on the 15 August 2014. The Islamic State separated the men from the women and children and took them all to the secondary school of the village, where the Yazidis had to hand over their mobile phones and jewelry. An estimated 1826 Yazidis lived in the village of Kocho. The Islamic State beheaded about 600 Yazidi men, and some were burned or shot alive. The bodies of the people, including some who were alive, were all thrown into mass graves. Subsequently, the Islamic State abducted more than 1,000 Yazidi children and women from the village. The under-14s were taken to Islamic State military camps where they were trained to become IS terrorists, and the Yazidi women and girls were held as slaves and sexually abused. Previously, 90 Yazidis (including 12-year-old boys) were shot dead by the Islamic State in the neighboring village of Qiniyeh on 3 August 2014.  Notable Persons  The Yazidi Human rights activists Nadia Murad and Lamiya Haji Bashar were born in Kocho.

This violated many key components of the Clean Water Act (CWA), which controls and regulates many types of pollution entering into waterway. Individual citizens joined the environmental organizations to sue the coal mining companies under the CWA. The Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet attempted to settle in Franklin Circuit Court in December, 2010 but was denied. The case moved forward to the Kentucky Supreme Court in April, 2012 who agreed with lower court rulings that Appalachian Voices and others were legally supported by the CWA to intervene in the lawsuit against Frasure Creek Mining and ICG.  Frasure Creek history  Found in McDowell Floyd County, Kentucky, Frasure Creek, officially known as Frasure Creek Mining LLC, was a Surface mining/Mountaintop removal mining location in Eastern Kentucky counties of Floyd, Magoffin, Pike, and Knott. This mine was formally the largest producer of coal in the state of Kentucky Coal mining in Kentucky however after being cited for nearly 20,000 violations of the clean water act, the mine had a maximum penalty of 700 million dollars for shutting down the mine.  Frasure Creek Mining lawsuit  In 2010, environmental organizations Appalachian Voices and Waterkeeper Alliance had reason to believe that Frasure Creek Mining and International Coal Group (ICG) were falsifying reports and violating permit limits. Frasure Creek Mining was accused of having close to 20,000 violations of the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act (CWA), previously known as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948, was amended in 1972 with growing environmental concerns in the United States. For years, Frasure Creek Mining and ICG were suspected of falsifying pollution discharge by reporting the same numbers but changing the dates. The coalition of environmental organizations including Appalachian Voices, Waterkeeper Alliance, Kentuckians For The CommonWealth and Kentucky Riverkeeper moved forward to sue Frasure Creek and ICG with support from citizens in October, 2010. Legal representations for the groups included Pace Law School Environmental Litigation, Appalachian Citizens‚Äô Law Center and Waterworth Law Office. The Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet attempted to reach a settlement before a federal lawsuit ensued in Franklin Circuit Court December, 2010. Judge Phillip Sheperd denied these settlements, agreeing with the environmental organizations that fines would not prevent future violations from the companies who had already failed to comply previously. On April 26, 2012 the Kentucky State Supreme Court also agreed with lower court rulings that Appalachian Voices, Kentucky Riverkeepers and others were supported by the Clean Water Act to intervene in the lawsuit. The Clean Water Act allows public enforcement on standards and regulations, established and assisted by the Administrator and the States.  Broken regulations and the effects of Frasure Creek Mining  The tens of thousands falsified data measurements that Frasure Creek reported to the state of Kentucky in and around 2010 included over 200,000 data points that broke multiple rules and regulations within the Clean Water Act. Coal companies, like Frasure Creek, are required to report water quality data for runoff. Regulations of the Clean Water Act that were broken by Frasure Creek mining and illegally falsified to the State of Kentucky can be found at: https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/history-clean- water-act Because the only measurements of water quality that were taken were proven inaccurate or completely reused from previous monthly reports, it is unclear what the true damage was to the environment and watershed in and around Frasure creek mine. Remediation processes are still being monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other environmental groups like Appalachian Voices to ensure and prevent no further leakage .  Settlement of the Frasure Creek case  After a five-year battle against a large number of environmental groups, Frasure Creek Mining company and Kentucky‚Äôs Energy and Environmental Cabinet agreed on a settlement on Dec. 7th, 2015. Frasure Creek Mining complied with a settlement agreeing to pay $500,000.This also includes a potential $6 million fine if the company does not abide by the guidelines of the deal. With years of violations of the Clean Water Act, Frasure Creek was issued the largest fine ever entered by the state of Kentucky for environmental violations against any company. Following the settlement, if at any point Frasure Creek mining company or any of its owners want to apply for new permits, a fine of $2.75 million must be paid. The company is also affiliated with two others, Trinity Coal Corporation and New Trinity Coal. These companies and their owners also agreed to pay the fine for future permits. Frasure Creek had already transferred their permits over a month before the settlement was reached. Otherwise, their mining application will not be processed by the state. By doing this, the settlement forced Frasure Creek to leave the state of Kentucky or pay a detrimental fine. From 2010 through 2014, various environmental groups claimed numerous cases water- monitoring data had been falsely submitted to the state. Part of the settlement was Frasure Creek had to admit to these violations at surface mines in Perry, Magoffin, Pike, and Floyd county, with the total number rising to the thousands. Many leaders of the environmental groups that fought against Frasure Creek thought the settlement was a strong one and that it sent a strong signal that citizens will continue to hold the state accountable to ensure communities and water remain healthy.

Inspired by the poet and influential Confucian scholar L√º Liuliang's anti- Manchu writings, Zeng conspired to overthrow the Yongzheng Emperor. However, Yue Zhongqi, governor-general of Sichuan and Shaanxi, uncovered Zeng's plans. Imprisoned in Beijing, Zeng eventually recanted his views and received the Yongzheng emperor's pardon. However, the Qianlong Emperor, immediately upon his succession, arrested and executed Zeng Jing.  Attempt at overthrow  Interpreting floods as signs of dynastic mismanagement of the land, Zeng Jing attempted to organize a plot to overthrow the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in 1728. He approached Yue Zhongqi for aid, but Yue, already under suspicion by the Qing, exposed Zeng Jing's plot. Zeng Jing and his few conspirators were easily caught and transported to Beijing. Zeng also published a tract attacking the Yongzheng Emperor, accusing him of disrespecting his father the Kangxi Emperor and of licentiousness.  Imperial response = The Yongzheng Emperor = On learning of Zeng Jing's treasonous texts, the Yongzheng Emperor did not immediately execute Zeng Jing. In fact, Yongzheng was grateful for Zeng's tract because it provided Yongzheng an opportunity to clarify some of his own positions. Instead of punishment, Yongzheng carried out a correspondence with Zeng Jing while the latter was imprisoned. Yongzheng eventually convinced Zeng Jing to renounce his anti-Manchu views and pardoned Zeng. It had been the case that L√º Liuliang _(_ 1629-1683) had deeply influenced Zeng Jing's thought. Closer examination of L√º's texts revealed that L√º harbored deeply anti-Manchu beliefs and that he considered the Manchus barbarians. Yongzheng exhumed L√º's remains and pulverized them. Yongzheng also issued and distributed a response throughout the empire, the Dayi Juemi Lu (Â§ßÁæ©Ë¶∫Ëø∑ÈåÑ: ‚ÄúA Record of Righteous Principles to Awaken the Deluded‚Äù) in which he argued against the principles that gave rise to Zeng Jing's plot in the first place and stated that there are really no differences between the ethnicities. Yongzheng later allowed Zeng Jing to return to Henan and even gave him some gifts on his departure from Beijing. = The Qianlong Emperor = The Qianlong Emperor, immediately upon his succession to the throne, arrested and executed Zeng Jing in 1736 in direct opposition to Yongzheng's directive that none of his descendants reopen the case. Qianlong explained that Yongzheng had punished L√º Liuliang because L√º had offended Yongzheng's imperial ancestors, but had treated Zeng Jing with clemency because Zeng attacked only Yongzheng. Now that Yongzheng had passed, Qianlong desired to punish Zeng Jing for offending his imperial ancestor. He also recalled all copies of the Dayi Juemi Lu and destroyed them.

Education  Goldberg grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan to a Jewish family, and fell in love with journalism when in the eighth grade she wrote a paper entitled \\"Opportunities in Journalism.\\" Goldberg thinks her career success began as a 20-year-old at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, when she was hired from an 8-week internship into full-time job as a reporter. To take the job at the paper Goldberg dropped out of college. Goldberg eventually graduated from Michigan State University in 1987 with a BA in journalism. She has since established the Susan Goldberg Scholarship. She is a member of the Alumni board of directors in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences. In 2015 Goldberg returned to Michigan State to deliver the commencement speech.  Career  Goldberg moved to Michigan's Detroit Free Press, where she became the first woman to be sent to Lansing, the state capital, where she covered the governor and legislature. She simultaneously finished her degree at Michigan State University. She then moved to California's San Jose Mercury News, as a reporter, where she played a key role in the paper's coverage of the Loma Prieta earthquake, which went on to win a Pulitzer Prize. In 1989 she joined USA Today and, over ten years, worked across News, Life and Enterprise. Goldberg moved up the ranks at USA Today and eventually became deputy managing editor. After 11 years of marriage, Goldberg's first husband died in 1999. She returned to the San Jose Mercury News to become managing editor. In 2007 she resigned to join Cleveland's The Plain Dealer. When Goldberg left The Plain Dealer, she was upset: \\"in a short time, I have become deeply attached to Cleveland\\". In 2010 she was approached by Bloomberg, and what began as a West Coast job resulted in becoming executive editor of Bloomberg's Washington Bureau. Of her editorial leadership, Frank Bass said that in her leadership, \\"Goldberg proved that patience and enthusiasm aren't mutually exclusive traits.\\" During 2012 and 2013 Goldberg was president of the American Society of News Editors, with a focus on developing young leaders in journalism.

National Geographic  National Geographic magazine was first published in October 1888. In 2014 Goldberg became the 10th, and first female, editor of the magazine. She is also the first Jewish editor in chief of the magazine. With Goldberg in charge, it won a National Magazine Award for best website and the George Polk Award for reporting. Goldberg received the 2015 Exceptional Woman in Publishing Award.

He is merited with the development of the Kompogas- Process around 1989, and the Kompogas company founded in 1991 (since 2011 Axpo Kompogas AG, since 2014 Hitachi Zosen Inova AG) both well-known in Switzerland. The seat of his construction company is Glattbrugg.  Life and works  Walter Schmid founded the construction business under his name in 1966, when he was 21 years old; he started with five employees when he took over the construction company G. Fumasoli in Glattbrugg. From an early age, Schmid pragmatically built everything technically feasible to save (fossil) energy, always in the hope that the solutions would also pay off economically. As early as 1975, Walter Schmid built one of the first vacuum solar collector systems in Switzerland, combined with a wood heating system. This was followed by earth collectors, deep water drilling and in 1988 his first building integrated photovoltaic system. Today, the construction company employs about 130 people. = \\"Solcar\\" = In contrast to building construction, where Schmid could implement his ideas independently, his electric vehicle concept \\"Solcar\\" was awarded prizes in 1990, but found only 150 of the required 500 buyers, so the project was discontinued. = Kompogas = In 1989, after a trial on the balcony a fermenter of 20 cubic meters was developed. He founded in 1991, funded by the Canton of Zurich, the company Kompogas, which produces biogas and compost from vegetable waste. Schmid first had to prevail against numerous politicians to get green waste. As early as 2005, the Handelszeitung wrote that rising energy prices would help in the future for such projects. Kompogas AG started in R√ºmlang with an annual output of approx. 2.8 million kWh. Since 1995 lorries filled with biogas from Walter Schmid AG and the company Kompogas travel the roads, the first truck reached its millionth kilometer in the summer of 2010. In 2009, Kompogas produced 18 million kilowatt hours of electricity and 9 million kilowatt hours of biogas in Switzerland. There are 80 plants worldwide in operation, with the largest plant in Qatar. In the Swiss plants, the resulting compost can be obtained free of charge from the population and is certified for organic farming. Since 2006, Axpo has held a minority stake in Kompogas and in 2011, Axpo became the sole owner of the company. In October 2014, Hitachi Zosen Inova AG took over the plant of the Kompogas process from Axpo in Zurich. 15 fermentation plants using the Kompogas process will continue to be operated by Axpo. = Umwelt Arena = Umwelt Arena at the information booth in Shoppi Tivoli After the experience with Kompogas and the related interest of the population, Walter Schmid built a center in Spreitenbach from 2010 to 2012, in which the population can find out about the latest state of the available energy efficiency techniques. According to Schmid's ideas, the technically feasible is to be shown there and nothing is sold. After Schmid made financial losses with many of his innovations, the construction of the environmental arena does not rely on proven technology; the entire building is cooled by heat exchange with the ground in summer and heated in winter. The energy for this automation system requires a maximum of 60 percent of the energy from the photovoltaic elements on the roofs surface. Umwelt Arena AG was entered in the commercial register on 22 October, 2009. Schmid invested 50 million francs in the project. For Walter Schmid the project is not completed with the completion of construction, but the enterprise must also be organized, not only energy- saving, but also communicative. The canton of Aargau maintains an exhibition on biodiversity, but this is the only contribution from the public sector. All other exhibitions are run by companies. The days in the week that are open to the public are Thursday through Sunday, since the building is also used as a venue. = Private = Schmid is an avid motorist and was 1996 European champion in autocross.

This body of water extends in the townships of Mesplet and Cherrier. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second. The hydrographic slope of Lake Saint-Cyr is accessible through a forest road (North-South direction) on the east side of the Saint-Cyr River Valley; in addition, another forest road (East-West direction) serves the northern part of the Saint-Cyr Lake Biodiversity Reserve and connects R1015 to the west. The surface of Lac Saint-Cyr is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.  Geography Toponymy The former name of this body of water was \\"Maskotirikan Lake\\". The term \\"Saint-Cyr\\" is a family name of French origin. Its meaning is associated with that of the Saint-Cyr River (Opawica River) whose upper part was named distinctly Saint-Cyr River South on September 24, 2003 by the Commission de toponymie du Quebec. This commission took into account that the course of the Saint-Cyr river belonged from now on to two hydrographic slopes as a result of the construction of an impoundment dam.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 for having state-level significance in the theme of archaeology. It was nominated for being a largely undisturbed occupation site with intact stratigraphy and numerous biofacts stretching from the late Archaic period to the Oneota period. This timeframe spans roughly from 3,500 to 500 years ago. The site yielded the oldest known evidence of domesticated plants in Minnesota: seeds dated to 2,500 years ago from the squash Cucurbita pepo. Description The King Coulee Site is located near the mouth of a valley that empties into Lake Pepin. The stream that carved the valley‚Äîor \\"coulee\\" in the parlance of the Driftless Area‚Äîcarried sediments down into a small floodplain. Over the centuries the sediments grew deeper while Lake Pepin's water level rose, creating a layer of saturated soil that preserves organic material stretching back 3,500 years. The biofacts include wood, nut shells, and seeds. From the earliest date of inhabitation the steep-sided coulee would have been forested and watered by a perennial stream. These factors provided shelter from sun, wind, and forest fires. A variety of food resources from fish and shellfish to waterfowl and game mammals were present or nearby. Since Lake Pepin is a natural widening of the Mississippi River, the site was on a major transportation corridor. History The site was first occupied by humans around 3,500 years ago during the Archaic period. This is based on findings of projectile points, stone tools, faunal and botanical remains, and an absence of ceramics. A later Archaic occupation around 2,300 years ago has also been identified from two projectile points surrounded by a quantity of charcoal. Two Cucurbita pepo seeds recovered from the site have been radiocarbon dated to 2530¬±60 Before Present (BP), during the Late Archaic. To date these are the oldest evidence of cultigens in the Upper Midwest. Previously the oldest appearance of Cucurbita pepo in the region was from the Middle Woodland, found near Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and dated to around 160 CE. Archaeologists speculate that the site was occupied by seasonal encampments in the late summer or fall during the Early Woodland period, about 1,940 years ago. The one deposit identified from this period contained sand-tempered ceramics and a small midden composed of mussel shells, animals bones, nut shells, and a few stone tools. Middle Woodland use is echoed only by a scatter of grit-tempered ceramics. More abundant are thin, grit-tempered ceramics with a variety of surface treatments characteristic of the Late Woodland period. The upper strata of the site contain shell-tempered ceramics indicative of the Oneota people. Railroad tracks were laid across the mouth of the coulee in 1876 but did not substantially impact the site. Sometime later in the 19th century a flood deposited one or two meters of sediment on top of the site, insulating it from later impacts such as the construction of U.S. Route 61 in the 1930s. The site was unknown to modern people until 1987, when an archaeological survey was conducted in advance of roadwork on the highway. When the significance of the site was recognized, the Minnesota Department of Transportation redesigned their plans to keep it intact. The survey ultimately excavated seven test pits and eight trenches, uncovering 25,000 artifacts and biofacts. 66% of these were faunal remains like bones and shells, 19% were lithics, 14% were ceramic sherds, and 1% were botanical remains like wood, charcoal, and seeds. Significance The King Coulee Site is significant on three major points. First, it preserves a deep and well stratified cultural sequence ranging from the Archaic period through the Woodland and up to Oneota times. This is virtually unique within Southeast Minnesota, where most sites have thin layers from which it is difficult to establish firm chronologies about what material is characteristic of which period. Such sequencing has hitherto been based on extrapolations from better stratified sites in Wisconsin and Iowa, so the King Coulee Site is valuable for providing a local source for this analysis. In particular it can provide future researchers with a clearer chronology of the region's little-documented transition between the Archaic and Woodland periods. The site's second area of significance is in the rare abundance of biofacts, which are valuable for research on prehistoric resource use. The presence of domestic squash seeds in the Archaic strata is especially revealing, as this is the northernmost evidence of its presence during that period. In the words of archaeologist Bradley Perkl, it demonstrates that \\"use of domesticated plants occurred much earlier in the region than previously acknowledged\\" and supports the revisionist theory that later domestic crops such as maize \\"were incorporated into existing horticultural systems\\". Finally, the minimal impacts to the King Coulee Site since European contact lend it additional significance as an archaeological resource.

He is the father of Czech actress Simona Sta≈°ov√° and the first husband of Czech actress Ji≈ôina Bohdalov√°.  Biography  In 1951 he graduated from the Higher School of Special Education of the Czech Technical University in Prague and received the masters degree. After university he was required to have a compulsory two-year military service, where he joined the vehicle company Dob≈ôany near Pilsen as a military driver. He gained experience by driving all kinds of cars, half-track vehicles and self-propelled drilling rigs, which was later useful for his scientific-research activities. From 1953 to 1959 he worked at Institute of Studying Coal Deposits, where he established a group for surface seismic measurements in order to refine the deposit and tectonic conditions of the coal deposit of Ostravsko Karvin√° mining area. He was responsible for the scientific-methodical, operational-technical and especially safety preparation. Using the methods of refraction and reflection he mapped the entire district of OKR, including its coal mines in Ostrava, Pet≈ôvald and Karvin√° parts of the Ostrava-Karvin√° mining area. On the basis of an instruction from Federal Ministry of Fuel and Energy in 1959, together with the entire seismic group, he was transferred to the GPO Ostrava (Geological Survey of Ostrava) as a state delimitation, where it continued to carry out seismic measurements in the interest areas of OKR. He identified and documented the interest and structural-tectonic information necessary for gas and coal exploration. In 1962, he obtained a bachelor's technical license, authorizing him to perform and perform in-situ fireworks in situ for water, borehole and airplanes. Seismic waves cause seismic waves, which are important for surface and seismic measurements in situ. In 1964, he discovered a significant increase in the carbon monoxide layers in the southwest of the OKR, which was subsequently proven and defined as a new prospective coal deposit (today's Fren≈°t√°t-jih). In 1965, all surface geophysical measurements in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (CSSR) were again decided by the FMPE to be centralized into the national company Geofyzika - BRNO, the seismic group of GPO Ostrava. In the same year, after a successful refinement of the structural and tectonic state of the rock state in the OKR area, the GPO terminated its employment relationship with the agreement of further professional cooperation. Charles University diploma (1968) Between 1960 and 1966 he studied at Charles University for a long time. In 1966 he received the title RNDr. at the Faculty of Science of Charles University in geophysics. Between 1965 and 1996, he cooperated with VVUU (Research Coal Institute), where he transferred his knowledge of surface seismic into the mining environment. His task was to carry out the necessary technical and safety measures and verify that the interest coal block could be utilized and that it was not tectonically disturbed. It has built up a new mining seismic facility within the SCI, which was a completely new discipline in the CSSR. He also succeeded in specifying, physically describing, evoking and using a completely new, world-known seismic so-called transverse seam wave (TSW) to which he obtained the patent. In-situ measurement results in the TSWmethod in the Czech Republic and the world have reached a high level of expertise that has enabled increased coal mining efficiency not only in the Czech Republic but also in the world. State Prize of the President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (1974) Within the framework of the VV√öS activities, more than 120 coal blocks (in all Czech and Slovak coal basins) were measured by the TSW method and sample measurements were carried out in the coal mines of Poland, Hungary, Georgia, China and Australia. TSW-method has been awarded with a patent of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, USA, England, Japan, China, Poland. He won the state prize of the President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Honorable Recognition of the Tbilisi Academy in Georgia, Honorable Mention Bytom, Zlat√Ω kahan OKR. Since 1989, the Czech coal mining has begun to undergo major changes that have resulted in restrictions on the activities of in-situ work.

Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003 In the 1920s she was part of the wild crowd known as the Bright Young Things. Jeremy Hutchinson defended her on a drink driving charge (Deborah Mitford and her husband, Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire were passengers). A police officer standing guard outside the German Embassy arrested her and locked her in the embassy building, but she was seen to sway as she got into the taxi that had been called. Hutchinson persuaded the court that Parsons' uncertainty on her feet was caused by her high heels and tight evening dress. Photographs following the verdict show her being led out of court by John Betjeman, who apparently said to her \\"A wonderful show! This way, Bridget, old girl!\\". She has been credited with her brother Michael to have introduced the Charleston in Mayfair ballrooms. For a time in the 1930s, she had an affair with Sacheverell Sitwell. She was friend with Clarissa Eden, who said \\"I have never had women friends with whom I exchanged confidences, except perhaps now in old age and retrospectively. My friendship with Bridget was based on her being exceptionally intelligent and knowledgeable and, being older, more sophisticated. She was also extremely beautiful and had been loved by many, but either through fastidiousness or lack of passion seemed never to have responded.\\" Daphne Fielding wrote in her memoirs that Bridget Parsons had an affair with Prince George, Duke of Kent. James Lees-Milne, who, at school loved two boys, Tom Mitford and Desmond Parsons (both died very young), afterwards became infatuated with their sisters who reminded him of them, Diana Mitford and Bridget Parsons. In November 1935 a portrait of Lady Mary Bridget Parsons by Cecil Beaton appeared on Vogue. She was Beaton's friend, and frequented his house, Ashcombe, together with Diana Cavendish, Tony Herbert, Tilly Losch, Teresa Jungman, Elizabeth Smith, Lady Caroline Paget, David Herbert. Other friends included: Randolph Churchill and Tanis Guinness. She was friends with Cynthia Gladwyn, that in her diaries remembers: \\"It is curious to look back on those nights when Bridget Parsons and I used to sit on the staircase, wrapped in rugs, trying to talk about trivialities while the great thunder of the Blitzes raged and the whole building shook and the lights dipped. One didn't know for sure which crashes were our guns and which were bombs. Then at last the All Clear would sound and we'd go back to our beds.\\" She lived at Womersley Park, Womersley, West Yorkshire, England. She was on the board of the Zoological Society. She was friends with Patrick Leigh Fermor, who visited often Birr Castle, her family castle. She died unmarried on 26 January 1972 and is buried at St. Martin's Churchyard, Womersley, with her mother, Frances Lois Lister-Kaye, Viscountess de Vesci of Abbey Leix.

Sheadle was an American Great Lakes freighter built in 1906. She was built in Ecorse, Michigan, by the Great Lakes Engineering Works. She was owned by the Grand Island Steamship Company of Cleveland, Ohio. She had the identification number #203826. She was used to transport coal, iron ore and grain across the Great Lakes of North America and Canada. History The Sheadle was built by the Great Lakes Engineering Works of Ecorse, Michigan, for the Grand Island Steamship Company of Cleveland, Ohio. She was launched on September 29, 1906, as hull #22. She was powered by a 1,665-horsepower triple- expansion steam engine and fueled by two Scotch marine boilers. She had a length of 550 feet, a beam of 56 feet and a height of 31 feet. On November 6, 1913, the Sheadle was downbound from Fort William to Erie, Pennsylvania. On that same day the Sheadle met up with another downbound freighter, the Canadian steamer James Carruthers off the shores of Georgian Bay. The Carruthers entered Lake Huron with the Sheadle behind her. They could see the lights of the Carruthers until she made a port turn to keep her south of Great Duck Island and on a strait line to Georgian Bay. The Sheadle grounded at Bar Point just below Amherstburg, Ontario, after suffering some storm damage. She remained grounded for about 5.2 hours, after which she managed to free herself. She finally arrived in Erie, Pennsylvania, on November 12. The Sheadle's steering gear failed on November 19, 1920, while backing from a dock at Marquette, Michigan she was loaded with iron ore at the time. She struck the rocks, tearing away her rudder and putting a large hole in tank number seven, causing her to settle to the bottom. She was raised and went into winter layup in Marquette. The amount of money required to repair the Sheadle was $150,000. In 1924 she was purchased by the Forest City Steamship Co. of Cleveland, Ohio, and renamed F. A. Bailey. In 1928 she was sold to the Cleveland-Cliffs Steamship Company. In 1913 she was renamed LaSalle. She had a new tank top installed in 1936 and new side tanks installed March of 1949. The LaSalle was repowered with a DeLaval double reduction geared cross-compound steam turbine by American Ship Building Company of Lorain, Ohio. Canadian registry The LaSalle was sold to the Upper Lakes Shipping Ltd., Toronto, Ontario, in 1965 and renamed Meaford. In May of 1979 the Meaford was purchased by the Soo River Company of Toronto and renamed Pierson Independent. The Independent's with the Soo River Company lasted only two months. She ran aground in the Brockville Narrows of the St. Lawrence River on October 28, 1979. After being freed, she was beached at Longbeach, Ontario, where her cargo of grain was loaded into the Mapletah and the E. J. Newberry. The tugs that came to aid her were the Robinson Bay and Daniel McAllister. The Pierson Independent was freed on October 31 and was dry docked at Port Weller on November 11. A survey revealed the damage was too extensive to justify repairs. The ship was declared a constructive total loss, and towed to Hamilton, Ontario, by the tug G.W. Rogers. Scrapping She was sold to the Strathearne Terminals Ltd. of Hamilton, Ontario, in November. She was renamed Company and sold to a Spanish ship breakers the following spring. She was towed out of Hamilton, Ontario, on May 2, 1980, by the tugs Cathy McAllister and the Salvage Monarch. She arrived in the scrapyard in Santander, Spain on May 11, 1980.

At the time, three-fifths of all senators duly chosen and sworn (then 60 votes) were required to end debate on nominations under Rule XXII of the Senate's standing rules. The debate was sparked when Majority Leader Bill Frist (Republican of Tennessee) threatened its use to end Democratic-led filibusters of judicial nominees submitted by President George W. Bush. In response to this threat, Democrats threatened to shut down the Senate and prevent consideration of all routine and legislative Senate business. The ultimate confrontation was prevented by the Gang of 14, a group of seven Democratic and seven Republican Senators, all of whom agreed to oppose the nuclear option and oppose filibusters of judicial nominees except in extraordinary circumstances. Judicial nominations leading up to 2005=Clinton appointments: 1993‚Äì2000= In 1995, Democrats held the White House. The New York Times editorialized, \\"The U.S. Senate likes to call itself the world's greatest deliberative body. In the last session of Congress, the Republican minority invoked an endless string of filibusters to frustrate the will of the majority. This (is a) relentless abuse of a time-honored Senate tradition ‚Ä¶ Once a rarely used tactic reserved for issues on which Senators held passionate convictions, the filibuster has become the tool of the sore loser, dooming any measure that cannot command the 60 required votes.\\"\\"Time to Retire the Filibuster\\". The New York Times. 1995-01-01. There was no attempt to rewrite Senate rules for cloture at that time. In 1996, President Bill Clinton nominated Judge Richard Paez to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Republicans held up Paez's nomination for more than four years, culminating in a failed March 8, 2000 filibuster. Only 14 Republicans approved it. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) was among those who voted to filibuster Paez. Paez was ultimately confirmed with a simple majority. In addition to filibustering nominations, the Republican-controlled Senate refused to hold hearings for some 60 Clinton appointees, effectively blocking their nomination from coming to a vote on the Senate floor.Brian Naylor; Ron Elving (2005-04-05). Primer: Judicial Nominees and the Senate Filibuster. NPR. =Bush appointments: 2001‚Äì04= When George W. Bush took office in 2001 there remained dozens of federal court vacancies. Democratic Senators contended that these vacancies remained despite Clinton nominations to fill them because of obstruction by Republican Senators. Republicans held a majority in the Senate during the last six years of the Clinton administration and controlled who would be voted on. Democratic Senators asserted that, for the most part, Republicans did not raise objections to those judicial candidates, but simply refused to hold hearings on the nominations. During his first term, President Bush nominated 46 people to federal appeals court seats, of which 36 were confirmed. Democrats blocked the confirmation of 10 nominees, on the grounds that they were too \\"out of the mainstream\\" for a lifetime appointment. At the beginning of his second term, Bush resubmitted seven of the 10 names. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) vowed to fight their confirmation. Senate Majority Leader Frist threatened to use the nuclear option to get them confirmed. =Coining the term, 2003= Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) suggested using a ruling of the chair to defeat a filibuster of judicial nominees in February 2003. The code word for the plan was \\"Hulk\\". Weeks later, Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) coined the term nuclear option in March 2003 because the maneuver was seen as a last resort with possibly major consequences for both sides. The metaphor of a nuclear strike refers to the majority party unilaterally imposing a change to the filibuster rule, which might provoke retaliation by the minority party. Lines are drawn In the 2005 Senate, Republicans held 55 seats and the Democrats held 45 including Jim Jeffords, an independent from Vermont who caucused with the Democrats. Confirmation requires a plurality of votes, and the Republicans could easily confirm their nominees if brought to the floor. Earlier in 2005, Democrats had blocked the nomination of 10 of George W. Bush's nominees, saying they were too conservative and that Republicans had blocked many of their nominees back in the 1990s. Frist then threatened to use the nuclear option in response. Democrats warned that if Frist used the nuclear option they would shut down the Senate so that no business of any sort could be transacted. =\\"Extremist\\" judges= In March 2005, President Bush announced that the administration would no longer seek the American Bar Association's (ABA) evaluations of federal judicial candidates, responding to Republican complaints of liberal bias and ending a tradition started by Eisenhower in 1953. Despite this, the ABA's committee continues to provide the service. Democratic senators all favor the ABA input. In April 2005, Senate Democrats were blocking the confirmation of seven of President Bush's nominees, calling them too extreme for a lifetime appointment. The most controversial nominees were Janice Rogers Brown and Priscilla Owen (both later confirmed). Nuclear option readied Under pressure by the White House and social conservatives, Majority Leader Bill Frist signaled his readiness to pull the trigger on the 'nuclear option' to push through Bush's appellate court choices blocked by the Democrats' threat of filibuster. Senate majority leader Bill Frist said that Owen ought to have the \\"courtesy of an up-or-down vote\\" and was reportedly deciding whether to use the \\"nuclear option\\". Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote, in a letter to Frist, \\"But I want to be clear: we are prepared for a vote on the nuclear option.\\" Republican pollster Ayres, McHenry and Associates found that 82 percent of registered voters believe that \\"well-qualified\\" nominees should receive an up or down vote (which would have included all of the candidates except Janice Rogers Brown). An Associated Press-Ipsos poll released May 20, 2005, found 78 percent of Americans believe the Senate should take an \\"assertive role\\" examining judicial nominees rather than just give the president the benefit of the doubt. Democratic pollster Westhill Partners found that only 30 percent of Americans approve changing \\"the rules to require only 51 votes to end a filibuster ‚Äì thereby eliminating the current system of checks and balances on the majority party.\\" =Political motivations= Many Democrats viewed Frist's threats to push the nuclear option button to be more about his plan to run for president in 2008 than about the qualifications of the few nominees currently blocked in the Senate. Quoting from Slate.com: Pat Robertson, founder of Christian Coalition of America, and several other prominent Christian conservatives endorsed the nuclear option as a necessary means of getting conservative judges onto the bench. In a May 1, 2005 interview on ABC's 'This Week with George Stephanopoulos', Pat Robertson said that Democratic judges are a greater threat to U.S. unity and stability than Al Qaeda, Nazi Germany or Civil War. On Sunday, April 25, 2005, Family Research Council sponsored \\"Justice Sunday\\" featuring Bill Frist ‚Äì a 90-minute simulcast over Christian radio and television networks enthusiastically supporting the nuclear option. In January 2005, Dr. James C. Dobson, head of Focus on the Family, threatened six Democratic senators if they block conservative nominees. On May 24, 2005, after the compromise negotiated between 14 Senators was announced (the Gang of 14), Dobson said the agreement \\"represents a complete bailout and a betrayal by a cabal of Republicans and a great victory for united Democrats.\\" One of the arguments made by Senate Republicans opposed to the nuclear option was that Democrats might gain a Senate majority, or the Presidency, again. Thus the GOP might need the filibuster to block the appointment of what Republicans might consider to be an unacceptable nominee by the Democratic president. Protests against the nuclear option took place on numerous college campuses; on the Princeton University campus, outside the Frist Campus Center (named for the senator's family) students staged a protest against the nuclear option by simulating a filibuster for two weeks non-stop, beginning on April 26, 2005. Democratic opposition=Obstruction or a \\"power grab\\"= In response to claims of \\"Senate obstructionism,\\" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev) pointed out that only 10 of 214 nominations by President Bush have been turned down. Former President Bill Clinton called Republican efforts to paint Democrats as obstructionist \\"a hoax\\" stating \\"The Republicans wouldn't even give a vote to 40 of my Court of Appeals judges... never mind all the others that they wouldn't have voted.\\" One of Democrats' biggest complaints had been that more than 60 of President Clinton's nominees were bottled up in committee, leaving positions available for Bush to fill. (Republicans were the majority in the Senate for six of Clinton's eight years as President‚Äî1995‚Äì2001.) On April 27, 2005, Former Vice President Al Gore said, \\"Their grand design is an all- powerful executive using a weakened legislature to fashion a compliant judiciary in its own image. ... What is involved here is a power grab.\\" =Democratic proposal= On May 9, 2005, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid offered the Democrats' support for one of President Bush's judicial nominees, former Senate lawyer Thomas B. Griffith. Democrats cited this offer as a goodwill gesture to show that they are willing to cooperate with Republicans and confirm \\"acceptable\\" nominees. Reid stated that Democrats \\"will only block unacceptable nominees\\" (such as Brown and Owen), but would confirm Griffith, saying \\"Let's take a step away from the precipice. Let's try cooperation, rather than confrontation.\\" Republican spokesman Bob Stevenson rejected the offer, saying, \\"Why stop at one? We should take them all up.\\" Republicans contended that the Democrats' offer was empty, since the Democrats would have retained the discretion to block any of President Bush's future nominees that they deemed \\"extremist,\\" even when those nominees enjoyed the support of all Republican Senators. Thus, that Reid's offer did not resolve the problems that led to consideration of the nuclear option in the first place. Republicans also noted that the Democrats' judicial filibusters had already killed three of President Bush's Court of Appeals nominations (Miguel Estrada, Charles Pickering, and Carolyn Kuhl), as those judges withdrew their nominations rather than continue to fight the filibuster. =Republican counter- proposal= Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn) floated a Republican counter-offer. In exchange for ending the filibuster against judicial nominees, the Republicans offered to end the practice of bottling up appellate-court nominees in committee (a nod to President Clinton's nominees who were denied floor votes), and to guarantee up to 100 hours of debate on each nomination. Minority Leader Reid rejected that offer calling it, \\"a big wet kiss to the far right.\\" =Critical mass= On Friday, May 20, 2005, a cloture vote for the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown was rescheduled for Tuesday, May 24. The failure of this cloture vote would be the beginning of the nuclear option, immediately followed by the asking for the ruling of the chair on the constitutionality of the filibuster. On May 23, Majority Leader Frist called for a vote on Priscilla Owen. This threatened to trigger the nuclear option. Gang of 14 Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and Senator Ben Nelson (D-NE) reached out to a number of colleagues on both sides to compromise by winning confirmation of some of the disputed nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor, and Priscilla Owen) while preserving the judicial filibuster on William Myers and Henry Saad. Their efforts succeeded on the evening of May 23, 2005, one day before the cloture vote. They announced an agreement by seven Republican and seven Democratic Senators to avert a vote on the nuclear option while preserving the filibuster for \\"extraordinary circumstances.\\" The block of senators who agreed to the compromise included Republicans John McCain, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John Warner of Virginia, Olympia Snowe of Maine, Susan Collins of Maine, Mike DeWine of Ohio, and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island; and Democrats Nelson, Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, and Ken Salazar of Colorado. This group was quickly dubbed \\"the Gang of 14\\" in various blogs and news outlets. McCain, Chafee, Collins, and Snowe were already on record as opposing the nuclear option, leaving the Democrats two votes short of defeating an attempt to trigger it (they would have needed 51 votes to override Vice President Dick Cheney's tie-breaking vote). The bipartisan group was large enough to deny Frist the 50 votes he needed to trigger the nuclear option, and also large enough to reach cloture on a Democratic filibuster. It states, in part: Democrats in the Gang agreed not to filibuster the judges listed in the agreement (save in \\"extraordinary\\" circumstances) and Republicans in the Gang agreed not to vote for the nuclear option. The definition of what constituted an \\"extraordinary\\" circumstance was left up to the individual senator. For example, Graham and DeWine let it be known that they did not consider nominations to the Supreme Court to fit the definition. Frist reluctantly approved the compromise. Several of the blocked nominees were brought to the floor, voted upon and approved as specified in the agreement, and others were dropped and did not come up for a vote, as implied by the agreement. As a result of this agreement, Owen was confirmed 55‚Äì43, Brown was confirmed 56‚Äì43, and Pryor was confirmed 53‚Äì45. Later developments The agreement held force until 2013, when the Senate Democratic majority invoked the nuclear option for all nominations except Supreme Court nominations. In 2017, the Senate Republican majority eliminated the Supreme Court exception in order to defeat a filibuster on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch.

Burton Place in the Near North Side neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The district, which includes twelve main houses and five carriage houses, was developed in the late 19th century but renovated into an artists' colony in the 1920s and 1930s. Artist Edgar Miller and businessman Sol Kogen began the district's redevelopment by redesigning and opening Carl Street Studios in 1927; at the time, Burton Place was known as Carl Street. Kogen and Miller, as well as other Chicago artists, gradually converted other homes on the street into artists' studios and residences. While the homes started off as Italianate or Queen Anne structures that had become dilapidated by the 1930s, their redesigns featured then-modern styles such as Art Deco and Art Moderne; five of the street's homes retain their original designs, providing architectural contrast. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 6, 2007. The cul-de-sac was later designated a Historic District by the City of Chicago after one of the buildings was threatened by demolition. The landmarking effort was led by author Keith Stolte, attorney and Chicago Art Deco Society Vice President Amy Keller, and Edgar Miller Legacy founder and Executive Director Zac Bleicher.

On May 11, 2018, it was announced that NBC had passed on the pilot and would not be giving the production a series order. Soon after this announcement, the producers reportedly began to shop the series to other networks and streaming services with YouTube Red showing interest. On June 11, 2018, Amazon Studios CEO Jennifer Salke mentioned in multiple interviews that Lear had sent her the director's cut of the pilot episode for consideration of a series order for the production on Amazon Video. Salke had previously bought and developed the project during her tenure as NBC Entertainment president. By the end of the month, Amazon was said to still be considering the series. On August 2, 2018, it was reported that Amazon had passed on the pilot and declined to order it to series.

It occurred on May 1, 1980, and affected only the Federal Trade Commission for one day. Congress had allowed its funding to lapse as part of an effort to pass an authorization bill that would limit its powers, but the Carter Administration for the first time enforced a shutdown of a federal agency based on a new interpretation of the 1884 Antideficiency Act, causing new funding to be approved that evening. The shutdown caused the furlough of 1,600 employees and cost the government $700,000 (equal to $ million in ), mostly as a result of lost labor.  Background  Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued an opinion on April 25, 1980, stating that the 1884 Antideficiency Act required agencies to shut down during a funding gap. Five days later, on May 1, this opinion was used to shut down the Federal Trade Commission when Congress allowed its funding to lapse. Prior to 1980, federal funding gaps caused by the expiration of appropriations legislation did not lead to government shutdowns. This was technically noncompliant with the Antideficiency Act, a law passed in 1884 that made it illegal to expend government funds without a Congressional appropriation under most circumstances, because it was believed that Congress did not intend the cessation of government services under these circumstances. Over the course of the 1970s, there were many funding lapses often caused by tangential issues. In the course of legislative research, a staffer for Representative Gladys Spellman came across the Antideficiency Act provisions, and Spellman contacted Comptroller General Elmer Staats for an opinion. Staats responded that \\"we do not believe that the Congress intends that federal agencies be closed during periods of expired appropriations\\". However, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti overruled this on April 25, 1980, issuing an opinion that the Antideficiency Act did require agencies to shut down during a funding gap.  Shutdown  On May 1, 1980, five days after the Civiletti opinion was issued, funding for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) expired, causing the first ever shutdown of a government agency due to a lapse in appropriations. The FTC was at the time being funded through its own appropriations legislation, and the shutdown did not affect any other agencies. Congressional members had delayed the funding extension, seeking to first pass an authorization bill that would limit the investigatory and rule- making powers of the FTC, which they, and businesses, had criticized for its aggressive monitoring of economic activity. They were surprised that a shutdown was actually enforced. A total of 1,600 workers were furloughed, and meetings and court dates were canceled. U.S. Marshals were dispatched to at least two FTC field offices to ensure that the facilities shut down. Confidential documents were turned over to federal security personnel to be put into storage, as it was believed that the agency might be without funding for a significant period of time; packing and unpacking of these documents added significantly to the expense of the shutdown. The shutdown ended that evening, with the House approving an extension of funding 284‚Äì96, and the Senate 71‚Äì10. The shutdown was estimated to cost $700,000, of which $600,000 was for salaries. The shutdown occurred with the same party controlling the presidency and both houses of Congress, a situation that would not be repeated until the 2018 shutdown.  Aftermath  Carter threatened to shut down the entire government if Congress did not pass appropriations legislation by the beginning of the next fiscal year on October 1, 1980, but this did not come to pass. Civiletti issued a revised opinion on January 18, 1981, that softened some aspects of the shutdown, allowing work that protects human safety or property to continue. A widespread government shutdown affecting more than one agency did occur for the first time during the Reagan administration, on November 23, 1981.

Wright (Photographer): Train wreck on the Providence Worcester Railroad near to Pawtucket, August 12, 1853, Rochester: George Eastman House; Photo: Trains! at The George Eastman House, kodak.com Background The Providence & Worcester Railroad line was on a single track. Engineers would base their travels off of time tables that were provided, as well as keep track of time on their own watches. By using this method, strict time schedules ensured the line was clear for individual trains to pass by. One train would wait in the siding for the allotted time to pass, after which, it was assumed that the tracks were clear. Incident The train bound for Providence had reached its double-track siding and waited the necessary five minute span. After which, the engineer proceeded to go back onto the single track. The Worcester-bound train had not reached the siding yet. At a blind curve, the two trains collided, resulting in a boiler explosion and telescoping of the first cars on the Providence-bound excursion. Aftermath Fourteen people would perish as a result of the collision, with another seventeen severely injured. It was revealed the Worcester-bound engineer was running behind on his schedule and would attempt to make up for it by traveling at full speed. The accident was immediately photographed and would later be published in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper on August 27, 1853.

Biography  Gabrielle van Zuylen was born in southern France, daughter of Andr√©s Iglesias y Velayos, the Spanish consul in Perpignan, and his wife Mildred Taliaferro. She grew up in the United States and studied at Radcliffe College. She bears the title baroness van Zuylen as wife of the Dutch baron since they got married in 1956 in Boston. Although they divorced in 1987, Gabrielle retained the name Van Zuylen. The Van Zuylen couple bought the property Haras de Varaville in Normandy in 1964. The property consisted of a 17th-century stable and ruins of castles that burned down in 1937. They asked the American architect Peter Harden to build a new home in a modern style. The garden was created and designed by the British landscape architect Russell Page. Gabrielle van Zuylen later wrote the book The Gardens of Russell Page, which is about his influence in landscape architecture. The Garden Writers Association of America named this work 'best book on gardens'. She became a specialist on the construction of gardens and published several works about the subject, especially about historic gardens. Her books appeared mostly in French and English and some were also published or translated in other languages. She was a member of the , Les Amateurs de Jardins and was a Chevalier of the Order of Agricultural Merit. She was also a gardener.  Interview  An interview between Van Zuylen and √âditions Gallimard took place on the occasion of the publication of (UK ed. ‚Äì The Garden: Visions of Paradise), a heavily illustrated pocket book belonging to the collection \\"D√©couvertes Gallimard\\", which gives a concise history of the gardens, from antiquity to the modern day. Van Zuylen described that pleasure is the primary purpose of a garden, the gardens have always been called \\"pleasure gardens\\". There are also three main functions of the garden: the sacred ‚Äì \\"sacred enclosure\\", the place blessed by gods; the power ‚Äì the great gardens of Cyrus in Persia were wonderful paradises, but also masterful demonstrations of power; the domestic ‚Äì the small, useful and popular city gardens. The Romans were the first to have the aesthetic concern of nature, for them, the garden was the counterpart of architecture. In the Middle Ages, the garden also played a very important role, but in another sense: it was walled, protected from the outside. It was the secret garden, the garden of delights, allegory and theatre of love. The large classical gardens of the monarchy at Vaux-le- Vicomte and Versailles, the gardens √† la fran√ßaise. In the eighteenth-century England, on the contrary, with the landscape gardens developed by the large landowners which are far from the court. The garden is truly a mirror, the counterpart of the social, political and artistic history of a civilisation.  US edition (left) and UK edition. (lit. 'All the Gardens of the World'; in United Kingdom ‚Äì The Garden: Visions of Paradise; in United States ‚Äì Paradise on Earth: The Gardens of Western Europe), an elegantly and beautifully illustrated pocket-sized book that treats about the history of Western gardens in a professional way, from antiquity (chap. I, \\"The Gardens of Antiquity and the Legacy of Islam\\": the Mesopotamian, Persian, Greek and Roman gardens), medieval Europe (chap. II, \\"The Medieval Garden\\"), Renaissance Italy (chap. III, \\"The Gardens of Renaissance Italy\\"), Classical France (chap. IV, \\"Formality Triumphant: The Classic French Garden\\"), 18th-century England (chap. V, \\"Planting Pictures: The English Landscape Garden\\") up to the modern day (chap. VI, \\"From Eclecticism to Modernism\\": for instance, the Parc Andr√© Citro√´n). The book provides numerous historical documents in its second part‚Äîthe \\"Documents\\" section‚Äîwhich contains a compilation of excerpts divided into seven parts: 1, The origins of European gardens; 2, Gardens of the Middle Ages; 3, The Renaissance; 4, The royal gardens of France; 5, Art or nature?; 6, The diversity of 20th-century gardening; 7, Gardens of the New World. At the end of the book are glossary, list of the great European gardens, excerpts from the Florence Charter, further reading, list of illustrations and index. It has been translated into American and British English, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Turkish, South Korean, simplified and traditional Chinese. Van Zuylen explains in the book the origin and meaning of a number of historical terms: * Persian : via Alexander the Great the Greeks became familiar with the phenomenon of ornamental garden‚Äîthe Persian ‚Äîcharacterised by a watercourse in cross form, the Charbagh. * Epicureanism: \\"happiness lies in moderation and refinement\\", refers to an eponymous philosopher and gardener in ancient Athens. * : originally the place dedicated to a local god (a protective spirit), later the specific attributes or special significance of a piece of landscape. * : with the Romans, originally a place for cultivation of vegetables or fruits, later that is combined with water, trellis work and murals. Currently it means \\"garden\\" as in horticulture. Rhenish master in the early 15th century is at once an exemplary and a telling record of late medieval gardening practices.' ‚Äì Excerpted from the caption for the painting which found on as a double-page spread illustration in this book. It is natural using French sources in an English garden book, especially with regard to the medieval gardens, such as the frescoes from the Palais des Papes in Avignon and illustrations from the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. But the author didn't forget to include some German sources, with being one of them. It goes without saying that the glory of classical French garden culture and the dynasties of famous garden designers are discussed: Claude and Jacques Mollet (inventor of the parterres de broderie), Andr√© Le N√¥tre (known for the gardens of Vaux-le-Vicomte, Versailles and the Jardin du Luxembourg). A less well known figure, Peter Joseph Lenn√©, a 19th-century Prussian gardener and landscape architect who worked in Potsdam and Berlin (Klein Glienicke, Pfaueninsel and Tiergarten). Following the Viennese Prater as the first public park, Napoleon III commissioned around 1850 the prefect of the Seine department, baron Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann to direct the renovation of Paris. Haussmann worked with the engineer Adolphe Alphand and the gardener Jean- Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, they changed the closed hunting forest Bois de Boulogne into a recreation park for the Parisian public. At the same time, Frederick Law Olmsted designed the Central Park in New York City. Then in the modern times, the beloved gardens of Gertrude Jekyll (Munstead Wood), Vita Sackville-West (Sissinghurst Castle Garden) and Major Lawrence Johnston (Hidcote Manor Garden). The current canon of the good garden: a formal structure in combination with an informal planting, especially the perennials.

He currently resides in Montreal. His music is influenced by a range of composers and pianists such as Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Maurice Ravel, classical minimalists (Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Erik Satie), and modern composers such as Chilly Gonzales and Yann Tiersen. English pop singer Ellie Goulding has cited Blais as an inspiration for her fourth album. His debut studio album Il was released in April 2016 on Arts & Crafts, garnering critical acclaim, including making Time magazine's top ten albums of the year list. In 2017, he collaborated with Grammy-nominated English-Canadian electronic artist CFCF on the EP Cascades. His sophomore album, Dans ma main, was released on 11 May 2018, also on Arts & Crafts, and on 30 Nov 2018 Jean- Michel released Eviction Sessions.  Early life Jean-Michel Blais grew up in the rural French Catholic town of Nicolet, Quebec. As a young boy, his parents influenced his love of music. While not serious musicians, his father sang in a choir as a kid, and his mother would play the organ. Blais began his musical adventures by \\"drumming with pots and pans [and] mix-taping Radio- Canada \\"world\\" music, traditional, Celtic, [Andean], and Eastern European [music]\\". As a teenager, he took piano lessons, eventually studying at the Trois-Rivi√®res Music Conservatory. However, he found the academic world of music exhausting and restrictive, so he left after two years to travel. He travelled to Guatemala, spending several months there working at an orphanage. Looking again for a change, he then moved to Berlin for a year, and then went to South America, spending time in Buenos Aries, Argentina. Finally, Blais decided to settle in Montreal, pursuing a career as a special education teacher. He completed a degree in liberal arts with a minor in psychology while focusing his studies on special education. After graduating, he worked with children with disabilities and behavioural disorders for five years at CEGEP level. Career=2016: Il= While working in special education, Blais slowly rediscovered a fondness for improvising and composing. Blais constructed his debut album, Il, over the course of two years. It was recorded in two days in Blais' apartment with a Zoom recorder, allowing the ambience of his apartment to come through on the recording. Blais communicated via Facebook with his friend Devon Bate, credited on the album as BUFFLO, to mix the album. The recording was done in such a manner that the listener feels surrounded by the music. Blais originally released the album via Bandcamp in 2015, where it was discovered by Arts & Crafts, and subsequently given a proper release on April 8, 2016. Arts & Crafts also released the sheet music for the album, along with a deluxe edition featuring two bonus tracks that was released in October 2016. The album was widely acclaimed, ranking 10th on Time Magazine's Top 10 Albums of 2016. Exclaim! gave the album 9/10, writing, \\"Simply put, Il is a masterpiece.\\" =2017: Cascades= Michael Silver (CFCF) and Blais first collaborated when the Red Bull Music Academy sponsored a live performance featuring the two artists. Blais and Silver found that they lived around the corner from each other, then started finding similarities in their music and composition style. Cascades features two songs each of their solo works, reworked as a duo, and a cover of John Cage's \\"In a Landscape'\\"(1948). Cascades was also met with critical acclaim. For Pitchfork, Andy Beta opined that it \\"finds Silver and Blais warily feeling one another other out and then synchronizing to exalted effect by the record's end,\\" and called the duo's version of \\"In a Landscape\\", \\"one of the most unequivocally gorgeous covers imaginable\\". Exclaim! also highlighted Blais and Silver's chemistry, reasoning that \\"Blais' playing suits very well the pristine and glossy production Silver employed for those recordings, injecting it with a real sense of purpose here,\\" giving the album an 8/10. =2018: Dans ma main= Dans ma main is Blais' sophomore solo record, released via Arts & Crafts on May 11, 2018. Exclaim! gave the album 9/10 in an early review, writing \\"Far from spiralling inward, as always, Blais lets it all flow through him, and as private becomes public, the result is yet another intimate masterpiece\\". On the album, he experiments with different synth and electronic textures, a concept introduced to him while working with CFCF. Blais explains in a conversation with CFCF and Red Bull Music Academy, \\"I never want to lose contact with the original piano instrument, but we have so many tools now to treat it differently than to just have the instrument on its own, so why not use them, and how? It certainly is opening. It gives me sounds and texture possibilities\\". The album was a shortlisted finalist for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.\\"Polaris Music Prize Reveals 2018 Short List\\". Exclaim!, July 17, 2018. In August 2019, Blais released an EP of remixes of Dans ma main. =Eviction Sessions, Matthias & Maxime= Eviction Sessions is Blais' third project, released via Arts & Crafts on Nov 30, 2018. Eviction Sessions was inspired when Blais was informed he would be evicted from the apartment where he had lived for seven years due to gentrification within his Montreal neighbourhood. This was the same apartment in which Blais recorded his first album of instrumental music, Il. In October 2019, Blais released the soundtrack to the Canadian film Matthias & Maxime. He received special mention at the Cannes Soundtrack Award in May of the same year.

Society founder Henry Gerber was inspired to create it by the work of German doctor Magnus Hirschfeld and the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. A few months after being chartered, in 1925, the group ceased to exist in the wake of the arrest of several of the Society's members. Despite its short existence and small size, the Society has been recognized as a precursor to the modern gay liberation movement. =1950s=1950 * The Mattachine Society, founded in 1950, was one of the earliest LGBT (gay rights) organizations in the United States, probably second only to Chicago's Society for Human Rights. Communist and labor activist Harry Hay formed the group with a collection of male friends in Los Angeles to protect and improve the rights of gay men. 1951 * The Black Cat Bar, located in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood, was the focus of one of the earliest victories of the homophile movement when in 1951 the California Supreme Court affirmed the right of gay people to assemble in a case brought by the heterosexual owner of the bar. 1952 * Christine Jorgensen was an American transgender woman who was the first person to become widely known in the United States for having sex reassignment surgery. She traveled to Europe and in Copenhagen, Denmark, obtained special permission to undergo a series of operations starting in 1951. Her transition was the subject of a New York Daily News front-page story in 1952. 1955 * The Daughters of Bilitis , also called the DOB or the Daughters, was the first lesbian civil and political rights organization in the United States. It was formed in San Francisco in 1955. 1958 * The first gay leather bar, the Gold Coast, opened in Chicago in 1958. * One, Inc. v. Olesen is a landmark United States Supreme Court decision for LGBT rights in the United States. It was the first U.S. Supreme Court ruling to deal with homosexuality and the first to address free speech rights with respect to homosexuality. The ruling held that pro-homosexual writing is not per se obscene. 1959 * The Cooper Donuts Riot happened in 1959 in Los Angeles, when the lesbians, gay men, transgender people, and drag queens who hung out at Cooper Do-nuts and who were frequently harassed by the LAPD fought back after police arrested three people, including John Rechy. Patrons began pelting the police with donuts and coffee cups. The LAPD called for back-up and arrested a number of rioters.

After three protesters refused to leave after being denied service they, along with a black gay activist, were arrested. This led to a picket of the establishment organized by the black GLBT population. Later, in May of that same year another sit-in was organized and Dewey's agreed to end their discriminatory policies. 1966 * The Compton's Cafeteria Riot occurred in August 1966 in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. This incident was one of the first recorded LGBT-related riots in United States history.A smaller-scale riot broke out in 1959 in Los Angeles, when the drag queens, lesbians, gay men, and transgender people who hung out at Cooper Do-nuts and who were frequently harassed by the LAPD fought back after police arrested three people, including John Rechy.

The peaceful protest against the \\"homophobic editorial policies\\" of the Examiner turned tumultuous and were later called \\"Friday of the Purple Hand\\" and \\"Bloody Friday of the Purple Hand\\". courtesy the Gay Lesbian Historical Society. Examiner employees \\"dumped a bag of printers' ink from the third story window of the newspaper building onto the crowd\\". Some reports state that it was a barrel of ink poured from the roof of the building. The protesters \\"used the ink to scrawl 'Gay Power' and other slogans on the building walls\\" and stamp purple hand prints \\"throughout downtown San Francisco\\" resulting in \\"one of the most visible demonstrations of gay power\\". According to Larry LittleJohn, then president of SIR, \\"At that point, the tactical squad arrived ‚Äì not to get the employees who dumped the ink, but to arrest the demonstrators. Somebody could have been hurt if that ink had gotten into their eyes, but the police were knocking people to the ground.\\" The accounts of police brutality include women being thrown to the ground and protesters' teeth being knocked out. =1970s=1973 *24 June ‚Äì The UpStairs Lounge arson attack occurred on June 24, 1973, at a gay bar located on the second floor of the three-story building at 141 Chartres Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the United States. Thirty-two people died as a result of fire or smoke inhalation. The official cause is still listed as \\"undetermined origin\\". The most likely suspect, a gay man named Roger Nunez who had been ejected from the bar earlier in the day, was never charged and took his own life in November 1974. No evidence has ever been found the arson was motivated by hatred or overt homophobia. Until the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, the UpStairs Lounge arson attack was the deadliest known attack on a gay club in U.S. history. * The American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder. 1975 * Gay American Indians, the first gay American Indian liberation organization, was founded.https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c85d8sd4/entire_text/ * Elaine Noble began to serve in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, the first openly gay person elected into a state legislature. 1976 * Harvey Milk became the first openly gay male non-incumbent elected in the United States (and the first openly gay person elected to public office in California), when elected as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.Diane Kaufman & Scott Kaufman, Historical Dictionary of the Carter Era (Scarecrow Press, 2013), p. 180. * The Lincoln Legion of Lesbians was established in Nebraska, an early example of a lesbian organization in a rural state. * Gaysweek was founded as the first mainstream gay publication published by an African-American (Alan Bell).Seabaugh, Cathy (February 1994). \\"BLK: Focused Coverage for African-American Gays & Lesbians\\".

The events took place on the night of May 21, 1979 (the night before what would have been Milk's 49th birthday) in San Francisco. Earlier that day, White had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, the lightest possible conviction for his actions. As well, the gay community of San Francisco had a longstanding conflict with the San Francisco Police Department. White's status as a former police officer intensified the community's anger at the SFPD. Initial demonstrations took place as a peaceful march through the Castro district of San Francisco. After the crowd arrived at the San Francisco City Hall, violence began. The events caused hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of property damage to City Hall and the surrounding area, as well as injuries to police officers and rioters. Several hours after the riot had been broken up, police made a retaliatory raid on a gay bar in San Francisco's Castro District. Many patrons were beaten by police in riot gear. Two dozen arrests were made during the course of the raid, and several people later sued the SFPD. In the following days, gay leaders refused to apologize for the events of that night. This led to increased political power in the gay community, which culminated in the election of Mayor Dianne Feinstein to a full term the following November. In response to a campaign promise, Feinstein appointed a pro-gay Chief of Police, which increased recruitment of gay people in the police force and eased tensions. The SFPD never apologized for its indiscriminate attacks on the gay community. =1980s=1980 * Transgender people were officially classified by the American Psychiatric Association as having \\"gender identity disorder.\\"glbtq >> social sciences >> Transgender Activism 1982 * February 25 ‚Äî Wisconsin becomes the first state in the nation to make it unlawful for private businesses to discriminate based on sexual orientation in employment and housing.

Its mouth is located in the unorganized territory of Lac-Despinassy, Quebec. The M√©giscane River is one of the most important rivers in the region of Abitibi-T√©miscamingue. It has the reputation of being a privileged place to fish for sturgeon. Forestry is the main economic activity of this watershed; recreational tourism activities come second.

Toponymy Its name, like that of the lake, derives from the Algonquin metshishkan or mesiskine and means hook, with reference to its quality as a fishing spot. An 1898 map of the province of Quebec mentions the \\"Mekiskan River\\" to designate this watercourse. A geological map dated 1935 refers rather to the name \\"Monet River\\". The toponym \\"M√©giscane River\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968, at the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.Commission de toponymie du Quebec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: \\"M√©giscane River\\"  Hydropower generation  During the 1940s and 1950s, the Shawinigan Water and Power Company, which held the water power concession of the Saint-Maurice River, conducted several studies to evaluate the potential diversion of rivers to its rivers with hydroelectric plants. After several hesitations, the Government of Quebec authorizes the partial diversion of the M√©giscane to the Saint-Maurice River basin in 1951. The dam was built in 1954 in the municipality of La Tuque, in Mauricie. A second dam and a canal sometimes serve to partially divert the flow of the river to feed the Gouin reservoir and the hydroelectric dams of the Saint-Maurice River. This project was carried out in parallel with the installation of additional turbines at the Rapide-Blanc, Trenche and La Tuque. The total cost of the project, which has increased the company's installed capacity of (), is estimated to $14 million.

NCB Financial Group Limited is the parent company of the National Commercial Bank of Jamaica, the largest and most profitable financial institution in Jamaica. It is also the majority shareholder of Guardian Holdings Limited, one of the largest insurance providers in the Caribbean, and of Clarien Group Limited, a banking and investment management services provider based in Bermuda. The company is listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange and Trinidad & Tobago Stock Exchange.  History  The National Commercial Bank Jamaica Limited has roots dating back to 1837, when it began operations under the name of the Colonial Bank of London (England). From one branch at Harbour Street in Kingston, the bank grew to eleven branches across the island by 1925. In 1925, Barclays Bank of London acquired the Colonial Bank, National Bank of South Africa and the Anglo- Egyptian Bank. The new organization was incorporated as Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), which later became Barclays DCO. In 1975, Barclays Bank DCO transferred its Jamaican operations to Barclays Bank of Jamaica, a wholly owned subsidiary. The Government of Jamaica acquired all the shares of Barclays Bank of Jamaica in August 1977 and subsequently changed its name to National Commercial Bank Jamaica Limited (NCB). In 1985, NCB Group Limited was incorporated as a holding company in order to reorganize the structure of NCB and its subsidiaries. On the formation of NCB Group Limited, National Commercial Bank Jamaica Limited became a fully owned subsidiary and holders of shares in NCB received shares in NCB Group Limited through a swap. NCB Group Limited was listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange in 1986. Between 1986 and 1991, the Government of Jamaica divested 61% of its shares in NCB Group Limited, and sold the remaining 39% to Jamaica M&N; Investments Limited (a joint venture of the Jamaica Mutual Life Assurance Society and Jamaica National Building Society) in 1992. During a period of financial crisis in Jamaica in the mid 1990s, NCB experienced steep losses and an erosion in its capital base. In spite of a merger with Mutual Security Bank Jamaica Limited in 1996, NCB Group Limited was forced to seek government assistance in 1997. The Government of Jamaica, through its Financial Sector Adjustment Company (FINSAC), acquired 68% of NCB Group Limited for J$19.5 billion, which was used to purchase bad debts and recapitalize the business. The mandate of FINSAC was to help to stabilize profitability for NCB and to divest the shares it had acquired as soon as possible. Consequently, NCB developed and implemented a FINSAC-approved rehabilitation plan, which involved maintaining minimum capital adequacy ratios of 12% and accelerating the divestment of non-core financial services subsidiaries. As a result of the successful execution of its rehabilitation plan, NCB reported a net profit of J$405 million for the year ended September 30, 1999, representing a significant turnaround from its loss of J$1 billion in the previous year. In 2000, NCB Group Shareholders approved a Scheme of Arrangement put forward by the NCB Group Board, and as a result, received one ordinary share in a new parent company in exchange for each ordinary share held in NCB Group Limited. The name of the new parent company reverted to National Commercial Bank Jamaica Limited, and its shares were listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange, replacing the old NCB Group Limited shares. In 2002, Portland Holdings, a privately held investment holding company owned by Jamaican-Canadian businessman Michael Lee-Chin, acquired (through its subsidiary AIC Limited) 75% of National Commercial Bank Jamaica Limited from FINSAC for J$6 billion. Under Lee-Chin's stewardship as Chairman, NCB experienced significant growth, increasing its annual net income from US$6 million in 2002 to US$106 million in 2015. In April 2016, NCB Financial Group Limited (NCBFG) was incorporated as a financial holding company for the National Commercial Bank Limited and future acquisitions. NCBFG acquired a 29.99% interest in Guardian Holdings Limited in Trinidad & Tobago in May 2016 and in December 2017, acquired a 50.1% majority stake in Clarien Group Limited, which owns Clarien Bank Limited based in Hamilton, Bermuda. In May 2019, NCBFG completed its takeover of Guardian Holdings Limited with the acquisition of an additional 74.23 million shares, which doubled its ownership of the regional insurance group to 62%, at a cost of J$28 billion (US$207 million).

Elected Vice-President of the RIF in 2008, he participated in 2011 in the foundation of the SIEL, of which he is the president since 2014. Ouchikh is a prominent Roman Catholic convert from Islam in France. Biography=Origins= Of Algerian origin (Kabylie), Karim Ouchikh was born into a modest family that had settled in France in the 1960s. His father is a miller and his mother a housekeeper. He grew up on a housing estate in the suburbs of Gonesse. In 1990, he registered in the Bar Association and was one of the lawyers defending the victims of the Concorde accident in Gonesse in 2000. =First steps on the left= In 1995, Ouchikh joined the Socialist Party and became a member of the municipal government of deputy mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy. However, Ouchikh disagreed with the left on European and social questions, and he left the SP in the mid-2000s after sustained at the 2005 congress the motion for a left alternative. =Evolution to the right= In 2008, Ouchikh joined the Rassemblement for the Independence and Sovereignty of France (RIF), of which he became vice-president, and participated in the creation of the party Sovereignty, Identity and Freedoms in 2011. After the resignation of Paul-Marie Co√ªteaux in 2014, he was elected acting president of the SIEL. Finally, on October 25, a new Congress elected him President. He is a director of the Rassemblement bleu Marine and a cultural advisor to the president of Front National. Regarding the presidential election of 2017, Ouchikh \\"supports the candidacy of Marine Le Pen while watching with kindness Renaud Camus\\", and also supported Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Poisson, president of the Christian Democratic Party, in the Republican presidential primary. However, denouncing \\"the hegemonic will of Florian Philippot\\", the SIEL ended its alliance with the FN in the Rassemblement bleu Marine in November 2016. He is also a councillor and agglomeration of Gonesse and a regional councillor of √éle-de-France. The administrative court of Cergy-Pontoise invalidated his municipal campaign accounts on October 27, 2014 for late justification of certain invoices. The State Council invalidated the decision in December 2016, allowing the reimbursement of his campaign expenses. In 2017, Ouchikh was a candidate in the ninth district of Val-d'Oise.interieur.gouv.fr He finished 13th with 0.68% of the votes. In 2019, he ran with Renaud Camus for the European parliament elections: \\"we shall not leave Europe, we shall make Africa leave Europe,\\" as they wrote to define their agenda. =Religious beliefs= A member of a poor Muslim family, Ouchikh converted to Catholicism during the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, after being touched by the faith of the participants in World Youth Day in 1997. Baptized by Father Philippe Dorizon, he received confirmation from Mgr Jean-Yves Riocreux. He claims to have acquired during his catechumen \\"an indispensable spiritual teaching\\" but also to have discovered \\"a Christian civilization of which [he] did not suspect until very recently the infinite wealth of\\". In September 2016, he founded the SOS Churches of France association, intended to fight for the defense of the Christian heritage of France.

It is quasi-coherent if it is so as a module. When X is a scheme, just like a ring, one can take the global Spec of a quasi-coherent sheaf of algebras: this results in the contravariant functor \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X from the category of quasi-coherent (sheaves of) \\\\mathcal{O}_X-algebras on X to the category of schemes that are affine over X (defined below). Moreover, it is an equivalence: the quasi-inverse is given by sending an affine morphism f: Y \\\\to X to f_* \\\\mathcal{O}_Y.  Affine morphism  A morphism of schemes f: X \\\\to Y is called affine if Y has an open affine cover U_i's such that f^{-1}(U_i) are affine. For example, a finite morphism is affine. An affine morphism is quasi- compact and separated; in particular, the direct image of a quasi-coherent sheaf along an affine morphism is quasi-coherent. The base change of an affine morphism is affine.. Let f: X \\\\to Y be an affine morphism between schemes and E a locally ringed space together with a map g: E \\\\to Y. Then the natural map between the sets: :\\\\operatorname{Mor}_Y(E, X) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{O}_Y-\\\\text{alg}}(f_* \\\\mathcal{O}_X, g_* \\\\mathcal{O}_E) is bijective.  Examples  *Let f: \\\\widetilde{X} \\\\to X be the normalization of an algebraic variety X. Then, since f is finite, f_* \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\widetilde{X}} is quasi-coherent and \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X(f_* \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\widetilde{X}}) = \\\\widetilde{X}. *Let E be a locally free sheaf of finite rank on a scheme X. Then \\\\operatorname{Sym}(E^*) is a quasi-coherent \\\\mathcal{O}_X-algebra and \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X(\\\\operatorname{Sym}(E^*)) \\\\to X is the associated vector bundle over X (called the total space of E.) *More generally, if F is a coherent sheaf on X, then one still has \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X(\\\\operatorname{Sym}(F)) \\\\to X, usually called the abelian hull of F; see Cone (algebraic geometry)#Examples.  The formation of direct images  Given a ringed space S, there is the category C_S of pairs (f, M) consisting of a ringed space morphism f: X \\\\to S and an \\\\mathcal{O}_X-module M. Then the formation of direct images determines the contravariant functor from C_S to the category of pairs consisting of an \\\\mathcal{O}_S-algebra A and an A-module M that sends each pair (f, M) to the pair (f_* \\\\mathcal{O}, f_* M). Now assume S is a scheme and then let \\\\operatorname{Aff}_S \\\\subset C_S be the subcategory consisting of pairs (f: X \\\\to S, M) such that f is an affine morphism between schemes and M a quasi-coherent sheaf on X. Then the above functor determines the equivalence between \\\\operatorname{Aff}_S and the category of pairs (A, M) consisting of an \\\\mathcal{O}_S-algebra A and a quasi- coherent A-module M. The above equivalence can be used (among other things) to do the following construction. As before, given a scheme S, let A be a quasi- coherent \\\\mathcal{O}_S-algebra and then take its global Spec: f: X = \\\\operatorname{Spec}_S(A) \\\\to S. Then, for each quasi-coherent A-module M, there is a corresponding quasi-coherent \\\\mathcal{O}_X-module \\\\widetilde{M} such that f_* \\\\widetilde{M} \\\\simeq M, called the sheaf associated to M. Put in another way, f_* determines an equivalence between the category of quasi- coherent \\\\mathcal{O}_X-modules and the quasi-coherent A-modules.

Description Genoplesium despectans is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Up to forty five dark purple or green and purple flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall. The flowers lean downwards and are about long and wide. The flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg- shaped, about long and about wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance- shaped, about long, wide and spread apart from each other. The petals are egg- shaped, about long and wide with a pointed tip. The labellum is lance-shaped, thick and fleshy, about long, wide and sharply pointed with fine teeth along its edges. There is a narrow lance-shaped callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs between December and April. Taxonomy and naming The sharp midge orchid was first formally described in 1858 by Joseph Dalton Hooker who gave it the name Prasophyllum despectans and published the description in Flora Antarctica. In 1989, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Genoplesium despectans and in 2002 changed the name again to Corunastylis despectans. The specific epithet (despectans) is derived from a Latin word meaning \\"to look down upon\\".

Australia designed and delivered twenty-two Pacific Forum vessels to twelve of her maritime neighbours, between 1987 and 1997. Australia provided these vessels to Papua New-Guinea, and eleven other of its Pacific Ocean neighbours so they could police their exclusive economic zones, because that improves its own security. The Royal Australian Navy regularly participates in joint exercises with their Papuan New-Guinea opposite numbers. The duties of Seeadler, and her sister ships, include fishery patrol. In 2013 The Australian described Papua New Guinea's fleet of Pacific Forum vessels as \\"a neglected component of the PNGDF\\"‚Äîone rarely visited by Australian liaison officers. In 2014 James Movick, Director-General of the Forum Fisheries Agency, noted that five of the six boarding operations executed by Seeadler during the 2014 iteration of Operation Kurukuru, found potential infringements of the Pacific Forum's fisheries agreements. He called Seeadlers performance \\"outstanding\\". In 2014 EMTV reported that vessels like Seeadler were rarely able to put to sea, due to shortages of fuel, and maintenance issues. Seeadler crew members described her as too small for high seas. On December 23, 2016, Seeadler was on a joint operation with elements of the Australian Maritime Border Command when she fired upon a Vietnamese fishing vessel that had been poaching sea cucumbers.

It is usually considered a subspecies of the brown-headed nuthatch, although some authorities recognize it as a distinct species. It has some notable differences from its mainland counterpart, including a darker brown facial stripe, a longer bill, shorter wings, and a unique warbling call. Research using genetic markers indicates that both species likely diverged around 685,000 years ago. It is critically endangered and may already be extinct. Due to its very restricted range, it is highly threatened by habitat destruction and degradation, fires, and hurricane damage. Invasive species may also play a role. A 2007 survey previously indicated that only about 23 individuals remained. The destruction wrought by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 led to fears that the bird was extinct until 2018 when two birds were found. However, the extremely destructive effects of Hurricane Dorian in 2019 are feared to have finally finished off whatever was left of the population, especially the historically significant destruction and dramatic saltwater flooding of the Bahamian pineyards from the lingering Category 5 storm.

(doi: 10.1127 / 0077-7749 / 2009 / 0252-0017) Description Size comparation with relatives (blue) This animal is known exclusively for an incomplete fossil, but sufficient to reconstruct (at least partially) its appearance. Ohmdenia must have been a large fish, at least two and a half meters long. Ohmdenia was therefore one of the largest bony fishes of the lower Jurassic, surpassed only by the great chondrostei such as Strongylosteus and Gyrosteus . The body had to be relatively slender, with a symmetrical and slender tail. The skull was long and short, and had a jaw equipped with numerous teethsmall, rather robust, rear-facing and placed in an area that extended along the dorsal margin of the jaw. The combination of a long and slender body and a low and elongated skull is unique among the fish related to Ohmdenia (the pachicormiforms). Paleobiology The long mouths of Ohmdenia, together with the peculiar teeth, imply a particular diet for this animal. Usually, the pachicormiforms possess thin, needle-like teeth, or large fanged fangs, or are still totally devoid of teeth. Ohmdenia, on the other hand, possessed numerous small backward-facing teeth; this type of dentition is commonly associated with predators that feed on Cephalopods from the soft body. Even the jaws would seem to be less robust than those of the other pachicormiforms. The presence of two fossils of belemnites in the area of the belly of Ohmdenia corroborates the theory that this animal is seen as a predator of molluscs; cephalopods with a soft body.M.

Their plan is to construct a pipeline that will transport natural gas. In total the project will consist of 304 miles of pipelines with an additional 8 miles as part of the Equitrans Expansion Project, which will help to connect new and existing pipelines throughout the region. The evidence of a market demand and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Certificate policy requires at least 25 percent of the Mountain Valley Pipeline's capacity to deliver natural gas, be met by service contract agreements in order to justify the need for the project. Mountain Valley was able to secure these service contracts allowing them to proceed with the proposed project. When the pipeline is completed it will have the ability to ship 2 million dekatherms (Dts) of natural gas per day for distribution, with a large quantity of that gas being produced from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. Opposition was met during the initial request to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the FERC. Some of the issues raised by citizen groups include the right of eminent domain and the potential for negative impacts to the forests, waterways, and protected wildlife during construction. The pipeline is also controversial due to the fact that it will cut across the Appalachian Trail. A ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Elizabeth Dillon on January 31, 2018 granted the right of eminent domain to Mountain Valley in a disputed area but required current appraisals and bonds be set forth to compensate for any losses incurred by the land owners. Currently the Mountain Valley Pipeline is in the preliminary phases of construction. Local summaries from the Mountain Valley Pipeline Project website suggest it has the potential to bring in state and local tax revenue along with jobs and economic growth to Virginia and West Virginia, a region where the impacts from a decline in the coal industry has caused a ripple effect that spans across the entire coal industry ecosystem. The American Petroleum Institute claims that benefits from the pipeline could increased natural gas availability while providing a cleaner and cheaper alternative fuel source for American consumers. There are concerns however from communities that will be impacted by the pipeline's construction and interest groups who want to preserve historical landmarks, forests, wildlife, waterways, and parks. Specific questions were raised regarding the need for the project and its purpose. Additional inquiries called in to question whether there were alternatives to avoid impacts to the forest among other things which were detailed in the Final Environmental Impact Statement, along with recommendations by the FERC to minimize the impacts on the environment. Potential pipelines under review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, including the Mountain Valley Pipeline  Project description  The MVP project is a natural gas pipeline from southern Virginia to northwestern West Virginia retrieving its supply from the Marcellus and Utica shale sites. It is expectedly to provide two billion cubic feet of firm capacity per day that can be used in commercial buildings in the Mid to the South Atlantic areas of the United States. The pipeline is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission because it is an interstate obligation, and therefore must be overseen by the government, in accordance to the United States Natural Gas Act. The proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline natural gas pipeline will be owned and operated by Mountain Valley LLC, which is a joint venture between the energy provider Consolidated Edison, and various midstream partners, with EQT Midstream holding the most substantial stake. This pipeline, as with all others, will be regulated by the United States Federal Energy Regulation Commission. The Natural Gas Act is the main piece of legislation that the FERC uses to govern natural gas pipelines. This act states that the FERC has the authority to regulate the transmission and sale of natural gas, approve or deny the construction or abandonment of natural gas facilities, and impose civil penalties if any of its specific provisions are not met. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reviews applications for newly proposed interstate natural gas projects and regulates the energy markets of the nation. In October 2015, Mountain Valley filed for a formal FERC approval application for construction on the pipeline. In June, 2017 the Final Environmental Impact Statement issued by FERC. After the pipeline is built, the authority of the pipeline gets turned over to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) where records of incidences are also kept. The MVP is overseen by the EQT Corporation, a utility company and drilling firm based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. EQT transports petroleum and natural gas and is one of the largest producers in the Appalachian Basin. The pipeline is projected to span approximately 303 miles, and will cut across the Appalachian Trail near Peters Mountain Wilderness in Virginia.  Opposition to the project  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy is the principal force opposing this pipeline. This organization has worked with Mountain Valley Pipeline officials in an effort to minimize mainly the environmental impacts along the Appalachian Trail, which is a major recreational area in not only Virginia and West Virginia, but many other Appalachian states as well. Though they have cooperated with the MVP officials, they have deemed many of the environmental effects unavoidable and extremely detrimental to the scenic beauty of the Appalachian Trail, and ultimately remain staunchly opposed to this pipeline. Additionally, many citizens of Virginia and West Virginia oppose this proposed pipeline. A group of concerned individuals have taken it upon themselves to \\"tree-sit\\" near Peters Mountain in efforts to prevent logging crews from being able to effectively clear space for the construction of the pipeline, while many others have voiced their opposition to this pipeline via news interviews, grassroots movements, and in one case, by a professor chaning herself to the pipeline. The head of the Jefferson National Forest was reassigned, allegedly due to heavy handed tactics involving the protest, which included running ATVs on a section of the Appalachian Trail, and, according to Outside Magazine, blocking food and water supplies to protesters. Many landowners complain that they are kept up at night by construction, mainly because most of the land used to build the pipeline was taken from private landowners by eminent domain. In Virginia, bumper stickers are appearing on cars that read \\"No Pipeline\\". Many articles against the pipeline have been published in The Roanoke Times, and many protests have been organized. Mountain Valley Pipeline officials have repeatedly emphasized their dedication to the safe construction and operation of the pipeline. According to the United States Department of Transportation, transport of natural gas through a pipeline is the safest delivery system for any form of energy. The pipeline has determined to be providing 2 Bcf of natural gas daily to provide many markets and commercial building across the mid to south Atlantic areas. Additionally, the pipeline would be regulated by the United States Natural Gas Act, federal and state level ordinances will dictate the construction and operation of the pipeline. The Mountain Valley Pipeline has already been cited by government agencies for violations of Virginia's Stormwater Management Act, over problems with runoff from land clearance while installing the pipeline. Pipeline construction wound down for the season in October 2019, after \\"the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered the company to ‚Äúcease immediately‚Äù all work on the interstate pipeline, at least until questions raised by the latest legal challenge are resolved.\\"  Controversies and impact  Landowners located along the pipeline project see the privately owned pipeline as a ‚Äògovernment sanctioned land grab‚Äô, impacting not only the environment, but also the local economies of surrounding towns. Recently, a Federal court put a hold on a required permit for construction of the pipeline in Monroe County, West Virginia. The environmental concerns of the pipeline include threats to the streams, rivers, and drinking water along the route. This can include the forests, endangered species, fish nurseries, and the public lands that surround the pipeline. Water contamination has been one of the biggest concerns with the growth of this project, and there are concerns by some about the path of the pipeline, which cuts across sections of National Parks including the Jefferson National Forest in Virginia and West Virginia along with the Appalachian Trail. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy has advocated against the creation of the pipeline, arguing points including: * The permanent damage of the scenic landscape of the Appalachian trail * Concerns for nearby towns due to the lands being picked for the building of the pipeline are most susceptible to soil erosion, landslides, and natural gas leaks * In order to push for the building of the MVP, the Forest Service lowered their standard for water quality, visual impacts, and destruction of the forest within the Jefferson National Forest Management Plan. There is a concern that due to this change, there could be an increase in private companies taking advantage of National Parks or forests Proposed economic impacts are both positive and negative, including: * Private landowners near the pipeline will lose property to the pipeline company. If the landowners are able to keep their land, the property value will decrease due to the pipeline's presence. Due to the process of eminent domain, the ability for the government to attain private land and make it public land, landowners could have their land taken and given to pipeline companies. * Consumers of the pipeline will have to pay additional taxes in their electrical bills to pay for the building of the Mountain Valley Pipeline * Loss of ecosystem service value due to the destruction of the water purification and recreational benefits of the land Note that the statements above are from Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. Many economic gains have been argued by the Mountain Valley Pipeline project including: *Increase in employment within the region, expected to gain 4,400 jobs within Virginia and 4,500 in West Virginia *Increase in direct spending on the areas impacted: $407 million directly in Virginia and $811 million directly in West Virginia *Potential of generating $35 million in tax revenues for the State of Virginia *Positive tax revenues within Virginia, as the project has generate $35 million since 2015  References  Energy infrastructure in Virginia Energy infrastructure in West Virginia Environment of Virginia Environment of West Virginia Natural gas pipelines Proposed pipelines in the United States ","title":"Mountain Valley Pipeline"},{"id":"56371828","text":"The Pioneers of Liberty (Pionire der Frayhayt) was the first Jewish anarchist organization in the United States. The group was known for its Yiddish- language publications and antireligious social events, such as Yom Kippur balls. Their club's model was replicated in major cities of the Eastern seaboard.  History  The Haymarket trial of 1886 sparked nationwide interest in anarchist ideas. On the day of the trial's sentencing, about a dozen Jewish workers of New York's Lower East Side founded the Pioneers of Liberty, the first Jewish anarchist organization in the United States. What started as the work of militants soon attracted members who would become noteworthy speakers and writers: David Edelstadt, Moshe Katz, Roman Lewis, Hillel Solotaroff, and Saul Yanovsky. Alexander Berkman became another famous member. Many were in their mid-20s or earlier and together, their combined vim and oratory ability influenced immigrants of their neighborhood. The group was among the anarchist movement's most impactful. The Pioneers first organized around the Haymarket defendants, circulating propaganda among Jewish workers on the Lower East Side. The group ran Varhayt, a short-lived, first Yiddish- language anarchist newspaper in the United States, between February and June 1889. And together with the Jewish anarchist Knights of Liberty group, which sprang from the Pioneers of Liberty, the two organizations together founded the long-running Yiddish-language anarchist newspaper, Fraye Arbeter Shtime, in 1890. The Pioneers of Liberty also published an annual paper, Tfileh Zakeh (Pure Prayer), which circulated during the Jewish High Holy Days between 1889 and 1893. The Pioneers were defiantly antireligious. They eschewed religious tradition while retaining their secular Jewish identity. Beginning in 1889, they began hosting Yom Kippur balls, which featured blasphemous revelry on the holiest, most somber Jewish day of atonement. In this way, the Pioneers contributed towards a Jewish counterculture, with social events like picnics and concerts. The Chicago International Working People's Association, with whom the Pioneers were affiliated, worked similarly. In turn, the Pioneers of Liberty club was a prototype that would be replicated in other major cities of the Eastern seaboard.

Green published by the University of Chicago Press in 1999. The book details the development of the homosexual subcultures that developed in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo, specifically regarding gay men. Beyond Brazil is Green's first published book, and was followed by We Cannot Remain Silent: Opposition to the Brazilian Military Dictatorship in the United States.  Synopsis  Beyond Carnival draws attention to the lives of the male homosexual population in Brazil, specifically Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo. Green claims that homosexuality, though somewhat accepted by the general population, is still overall disapproved of. Combined with the current discrimination faced by the LGBT community in Brazil, Green's belief is that focusing exclusively on male homosexuals not only provides insight on a marginalized group, but also into how Brazilian's understand concepts of masculinity and femininity, acceptable behavior, and shared societal values. Medical studies, depositions of arrested men, autobiographies, and personal interviews are among the primary sources used in Green's analysis of the subculture among gay men that developed in Brazil's urban centers. Green details the history of the gay male community, beginning in the late 18th century. Given the lack of studies on the community, the vast majority of information is compiled from police reports. Though homosexuality was not explicitly illegal, Brazilian police were able to arrest gays found engaging in sexual activities for violating laws of public indecency, vagrancy, or sodomy. Most reports of these interactions came from the Largo do Rossio park in Rio de Janeiro. The novel Bom-Crioulo by Adolfo Caminha was published during this time, portraying homosexual encounters in a positive light. Contemporaries of Caminha harshly criticized the novel for covering such an immoral practice, reflecting attitudes of this era. Studies of gay men focused entirely on a bicha/bofe paradigm, in which the penetrated was a feminine bicha, and the \\"real man\\" was the bofe, or penetrator. Leon√≠dio Ribero's Homosexualismo e endocrinologia was the most commonly cited study explaining biological differences between \\"sick\\" gay men and \\"healthy\\" heterosexual men. These early studies on gay relationships emphasized a smaller community of gay men, with no acknowledgement of diversity within the subgroup, such as Madame Sat√£, who acted \\"masculine\\" but enjoyed to be the bicha in relationships. After World War II, as a mass influx of immigrants arrived in Brazil. With increased interaction with the United States and newer cultures, the label of entendido emerged in middle class gay populations to define someone who failed to fit into the strict active or passive roles in sex. Unlike past medical studies, Jos√© F√°bio Barbosa da Silva focused on the wider population of gay men, claiming that past studies may have been biased due to the understanding of homosexuality as an illness rather than a natural occurrence. Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo were the first to begin releasing gay themed magazines, like O Snob, which exclusively focused on gay culture and gossip. The increased representation of gay men in Brazilian society allowed gay culture to become more common among the general population. The popularization of carnival in Brazil allowed drag performers to enter the public eye under the guise of costumes and celebration. Gay clubs with drag performances grew more common in the two major cities, along with a rise in cross-dressing prostitution within the cities. 1970's Brazil saw an emergence of a visible gay rights movement, with activists pushing for greater representation in media and laws protecting the LGBT community from discrimination. National conversations concerning civil marriage and social violence and increased representation in carnival, Green claims, have established a growing movement for national recognition that homosexual identities are just as valid as their heterosexual counterparts.  Critical reception  * Review by Charles Klein in the Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies 107 (2002): 261‚Äì262. ** \\"Green does an outstanding job of taking apart popular stereotypes (e.g., Brazil is the land of liberated sexuality) and theoretical constructs (e.g., \\"traditional\\" versus \\"modern\\" sexualities) in his discussion of Brazilian gender/sexual worlds.\\" * Review by Susan Besse in the Journal of Social History 35 (2001): 470-471. ** \\"In looking at Brazil through a new lens, Green expands our understanding of the variety of ways in which Brazilian culture often tolerates (or even embraces) social differences while still preserving the rigid hierarchies and social exclusions that perpetuate privilege.\\"  Awards  Beyond Carnival won the Pacific Coast Council on Latin American Studies' Hubert Herring Award for Best Book and the Lambda Literary Foundation/Paul Monette-Roger Horwitz Trust Award.

The Blue Ridge Parkway and the Appalachian Trail traverse the area, giving ready access with views to the east of the Piedmont region and to the west of the Valley of Virginia.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 Description The region includes wilderness areas protected by Congressional action, inventoried wilderness, and uninventoried areas recognized by the Wilderness Society as worthy of protection from timbering and roads. A corridor along the Blue Ridge Parkway, managed by the National Park Service, and forest service land in the Glenwood Ranger District act as a buffer for the protected areas. The following areas are in the cluster: *James River Face Wilderness *Thunder Ridge Wilderness *James River Face Wilderness Addition *White Oak Ridge-Terrapin Mountain *North Creek (conservation area) *Wilson Mountain *Cove Mountain Location and access Map of the Glenwood ClusterFlanking the Blue Ridge Parkway, the region is south and east of the James River where the river turns east to cut through the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is 20 miles northwest of Roanoke, Virginia and about two miles southeast of Glasgow, Virginia. Interstate 81 parallels the area on the west and Va 122 on the east. The section of the Blue Ridge Parkway travelling through the cluster can be accessed from US 501 on the north and VA 43 on the south. Other roads in the area are shown on National Geographic Map 789, Lexington and Blue Ridge Mountains. The Blue Ridge Parkway, completed in 1935, follows the mountain tops at an average elevation of 3000 feet, giving access to scenic overlooks and natural areas along the way. Recreation areas in the Glenwood District include Cave Mountain Lake Recreation Area, a campground 8 miles south of Natural Bridge, Middle Creek Picnic Area, about 7 miles west of Buchanan, North Creek Campground, about seven miles from Buchanan, and the Locher Tract, a primitive picnic area about seven miles east of Natural Bridge. The Glenwood Information Center is in Natural Bridge, Virginia and the ranger‚Äôs district office is 1.5 miles south of Natural Bridge. Appalachian Trail The Appalachian Trail extends for 2185 miles from Mount Katahdin in Maine to Springer Mountain in Georgia. A 43 mile section of the trail passes through the cluster from its crossing of the James River on the north to VA 43 on the south. The route is indicated by a red-dashed line on the map of the cluster on this page. A high resolution map of the cluster is obtained by selecting the icon in the lower right of the window, then clicking on the map. The map shows side trails and shelters along the trail. The trail can be broken into the following sections, with a link to access and parking information: *James River (US 501) to Petite Gap (USFS 35), 9 miles. *Petites Gap (USFS 35) to Parkers Gap Road (USFS 812), 7.3 miles. *Parkers Gap Road (USFS 812) to Jennings Creek Road (VA 614), 11.4 miles. *Jennings Creek Road (VA 614) to Bearwallow Gap (VA 43), 6.6 miles. Blue Ridge Parkway Map of Blue Ridge Parkway from James River to RoanokeThe Blue Ridge Parkway connects the Skyline Drive on the north with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the south. From its low point at the James River with an elevation of 649 feet, it climbs to an elevation of 3950 feet at Apple Orchard Mountain. The road, with no stop-signs or billboards, is a scenic drive connecting overlooks to the west and east. Its construction overcame steep terrain, eroded mountainsides, granite and gneiss bedrock and extreme winter weather. Stonemasons from Italy and Spain built the sturdy walls and bridges still seen today. After legislation authorizing construction was passed in 1936, the highway was finished 51 years later in 1987. The highway, administered by the National Park Service, is closed when snow and ice create driving hazards. To maintain the rural views along the road, the National Park Service works with landowners of adjacent property and coalitions of citizens and state organizations to maintain visual guidelines. Support groups include Friends of the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation. Geologic history The geology of the Glenwood Cluster has evolved over hundreds of millions of years. During this time, oceans were formed, each leaving a layer of sediment on its ocean bed. These ocean beds would be layered on top of one another, except for stress in the earth's crust that created folds pushing the beds on top of one another. The result has left a challenge for geologists to determine the history of rock now found in the area. There is general agreement that the rocks in the Blue Ridge are the oldest rocks in the state, some being formed at least 1.8 billion years ago. The landforms in Virginia are part of five provinces‚Äîthe Appalachian Plateau, Ridge and Valley, Blue Ridge, Piedmont and Coastal plain. The Glenwood Cluster is located in the Blue Ridge Province, with the Piedmont Province to the east and the Ridge and Valley to the west. The Blue Ridge, the easternmost of the Appalachian Mountains, extends from Georgia to Pennsylvania, with widths ranging from . In some places the province is a single ridge, while in other places it is a complex of closely spaced ridges. Rocks include Precambrian granite, gneiss, and metamorphosed volcanic rock of the late Precambrian. James River One of the major river systems draining Virginia, the James River has formed large fluvial landscapes within the physiographic provinces of the Ridge and Valley Appalachians, the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Piedmont, and the Atlantic coastal plain. Water and sediments, collected from the large watershed of the James, are transported across the grain of the rock- controlled Ridge-and-Valley and Blue-Ridge provinces to downstream valleys now containing the signature of the evolution of the landscape in the river's watershed over millions of years. Beginning at the junction of the Cowpasture and Jackson rivers in the Allegheny Mountains of western Virginia, the James River flows for about to Chesapeake Bay, where it has become wide. The course of the river was formed over hundreds of millions of years as it followed faults in the earth's crust. Over time, it cut through of an ancient ocean's sediment to reach a bedrock of quartzite in the present-day Blue Ridge Mountains, creating a gorge through which the river now flows to reach Chesapeake Bay. Natural history Clusters of wild areas, such as the Glenwood Cluster, are important for the maintenance of biological diversity. A natural landscape contains a blend of ecosystems‚Äîmountain slopes, moist areas, soil types, temperatures‚Äîover which species can roam in their search for mates, foraging for food, and the avoidance of predators and other stress- inducing hazards. The construction of roads breaks up the landscape into islands which limit the free migration of forest species. Such edge effects have been shown to minimize the diversity required for the maintenance of a rich biological habitat. The bird population is also affected by the division of undisturbed forest into islands with edges defined by roads. Predators of birds, such as raccoons, snakes, skunks, house cats and egg-eating crows and blue jays, are often found at forest edges. And roads provide a pathway for Brown-headed cowbirds in their search for the location of nests of smaller birds, who then destroy the eggs and replace them with their own eggs leaving the unwitting owner to raise the cowbird hatchlings. The Glenwood Cluster is divided by several roads, the largest being the Blue Ridge Parkway that divides the White Oak Ridge-Terrapin Mountain area from the rest of the cluster. The cluster contains pockets of old-growth forests, wild and complex mixtures of different species and ages of trees supporting a great diversity of organisms living in a relationship that has evolved over many centuries. As land is being developed, these forests are becoming rare. There are several pockets of old-growth forest in the cluster‚Äîthe James River Face Wilderness contains as much as of old-growth forest in a steep, rocky terrain that was difficult to log. Glenwood Ranger District The Glenwood cluster lies within the Glenwood Ranger District of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forest. The district has an area of , with a large part created from the Glenwood Estate lands. Forests in the area were cut and recut to supply charcoal for the production of pig iron. The Glenwood Furnace, in the Arnold Valley, was built in 1849 and last operated in 1876. Historical records indicate that the furnace employed 148 men, women and children in 1864. Old charcoal furnaces are part of the historic sites of the Glenwood Ranger District. Repeated cutting for the furnaces led in part to the successive forests that are present today. The early Glenwood purchase unit was composed of 60‚Äì90% American chestnut, a favored slope species by silvicultural techniques in 1914. A blight, discovered in 1912, progressed to the point that by 1922 foresters were salvaging the tree before its destruction by the blight. Pulpwood and extractwood contractors cut about 200,000 cords of wood on the Glenwood land between 1930 and 1950. The district sold almost 75,000 million board feet of chestnut in its first 38 years, and by 1951 only an estimated 4400 million board feet remained in the district.

The protesters were families of students attending St Brigid's Primary School - a school run by the local Catholic church. Children enrolled at the school were all withdrawn and enrolled at local state schools in the town, placing pressure on the resources available at those schools. The immediate aim of the protest was to secure government assistance to construct a new toilet block at St Brigid's to meet government health requirements. The protests arose in a background of heated political debate about \\"state aid\\" to Catholic schools and accusations of sectarianism. The strike, in effect a lockout, generated hostility in Goulburn and across Australia. The action and the political aftermath saw both major parties in Australia commit to providing support to Catholic and other religious schools on a \\"needs\\" basis, a step away from the earlier philosophy of \\"free, secular and compulsory\\". The \\"state aid\\" model has persisted, despite some moves for reform, since that date. Background Catholic education in Australia started in the early 19th century and by 1833 there were at least 10 Catholic schools operating in Australia. These schools were funded by a mix of charity, fees and, until the 1860s, some government support. By the 1850s there was strong pressure from the community in each of the Australian colonies for education to be placed on \\"free, secular and compulsory\\" basis. The first colony to provide public education was Victoria (Australia) with the passing of the Education Act in 1872. As well as providing for public education, the Act removed government funding for non-government schools, including Catholic schools. By 1893, all of the Australian colonies had legislated to remove government funding from Catholic schools. After the introduction of free, secular education, the Catholic hierarchy and laypeople decided to continue to offer Catholic education. With no funding, Catholic schools relied on religious brothers and sisters for teachers. Most Catholics in Australia were of Irish background and relations between those Australians of Irish Catholic descent and the mainly Protestant establishment were often fraught. Sectarianism in Australia made the subject of state aid for Catholic schools too politically risky for governments and the Catholic hierarchy to entertain until the middle of the 20th century. After the Second World War, an increase in student numbers and a decline in religious brothers and sisters saw many Catholic schools in crisis. Classes with over 70 students were held in inadequate facilities. With direct state aid to Catholic schools not permitted, both state and federal governments provided some limited assistance mainly in the way of bursaries paid direct to families and in teacher training. Direct aid to schools for teacher salaries or facilities was unacceptable. Lead up Goulburn had a large and growing Catholic population and this was placing pressure on the Catholic schools in the town. The crisis came to a head in 1962 at St Brigid's Primary School which by this time had 84 students in one kindergarten classroom. Inspectors from the New South Wales Department of Education determined that in order to continue to operate, the school needed to install three additional toilets, to cater for the number of children enrolled. The school and the families of the children enrolled claimed to be unable to afford the cost of the additional toilets and with the support of the Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Canberra-Goulburn John Cullinane decided to take a stand on the matter. In a speech on St Patrick's Day (17 March) of 1962, Bishop Cullinane stated, in front of Laurie Tullythe local Member of Parliament and government memberthat St Brigid's may need to close. The local Catholics were refused a meeting with Ernest Wetherell, the New South Wales Minister for Education, to discuss the matter. The NSW government were advised that if they wished the school to stay open it could pay to have its requirements met. Local parents, paying taxes to support education, supported the Bishop's stand. Bishop Cullinane then invited the minister to a public meeting in Goulburn to debate the matter. While the minister did not show, 700 locals did and voted 500 to 120 to close not just St Brigid's but all six Catholic schools in Goulburn with the 2000 students of those schools to be instructed to seek enrolment at government schools. Strike The strike formally started on Monday, 16 July 1962 and was scheduled to last for six weeks. On that day, 2,000 children previously educated in Catholic schools in Goulburn presented themselves to government schools for enrolment. Of these 2,000, there was only room for around 640 to be enrolled. The enrolment process itself was smooth with both Catholic families and government schools acting in a spirit of mutual courtesy. The remainder were unable to be accommodated and did not attend school at all. Many of the children who were luck enough to be enrolled at a government school (there was a random draw for the available places) saw the change of schools as an adventure while the government school teachers did their best to meet their needs. Jack Plews, an English teacher at Goulburn High School stated, \\"I said I wanted them to enjoy their stay with us no matter how long it was, and we'd do our best to meet their needs in education. And I said, 'For both of us, I hope it will be a learning experience.\\" While the enrolment process was conducted in a courteous manner, the strike itself saw deep divides in the Goulburn community, both between Catholics and Protestants and between members of the Catholic community with differing views about the strike. One Catholic child remembered being struck in the face by a student at her new school, the assailant remarking, \\"I hate Catholics\\". Initial media coverage was hostile and led to threats against local organisers. Brian Keating, one of the organisers stated, \\"The members of the steering committee, Jack Mullen and Arthur Rolfe and myself began to get threats, and they were real threats. They were threats to our lives. We were told that if we didn't stop this rot, this strike, we'd stop a bullet.\\" The tone of coverage changed once the strain on local government schools became apparent. The fear of similar strike action or even the collapse of the Catholic system altogether led to calls that \\"something must be done\\". A local Catholic priest explained to the media, \\"We have tried for 80 years, by speech and talk, to influence them. And we hope that having failed in that way, that this action in Goulburn will help the people to see what we feel us a just claim and an evident one.\\" Catholic parents were nervous about the impact of the strike on their children's education , both before and during the strike. Before the strike one parent stated, \\"she would march on Parliament House rather than sacrifice her children - put them in the firing line, so to speak.\\" After a week, with the point made, this concern saw the strike action called off and the Catholic schools re-opened. Many of the enrolled children remained at their state schools after the strike. Legacy The action did not see immediate results for the participants. The Australian Labor Party (ALP) Premier of New South Wales, Bob Heffron, was loath to be seen to be forced into a decision but announced he was willing to listen to the concerns of the Church. Church leaders sought state aid for items such as scholarships, teacher training and salaries and capital funding for modern facilities such as science laboratories. The Australian Labor Party was \\"[thrown] into crisis\\" with the NSW branch seeking to respond to community concerns while the Federal branch, led by Joe Chamberlain were firm in standing by party policy opposing state aid. Seeking to exploit this split, in 1963, the Liberal Party of Australia Prime Minister Robert Menzies (a Protestant) announced a new policy committing to federal funding of science laboratories for all schools, government and non-government, and called an early election on this platform. The 1963 election was a success for Menzies who increased his margin by 10 seats, winning an additional seven seats in New South Wales. This result has been at least in part ascribed to Catholic voters leaving their traditional support for the ALP. Later Prime Minister John Howard said of the result \\"what really happened is that we got Menzies‚Äô Catholics in 1963 for the first time in a really big way. This result saw both parties begin to move in the direction of state aid. While some in the ALP bitterly opposed the concept, the pragmatic Gough Whitlam managed to lead his party to a compromise position where aid would be provided to schools on the basis of need. In response to this trend, a pressure group -- Defence of Government Schools (DOGS) -- was formed in 1966 to oppose funding to private religious schools. in 1981 DOGS brought forward a case in the High Court of Australia --Attorney-General (Vic) (Ex rel Black) v Commonwealth-- seeking to have state aid for religious schools deemed unconstitutional under Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia. The case was lost with the High Court taking a narrow reading of the s116 prohibition. The question of state aid for religious schools is still controversial today. In 2010 the Federal Government under Prime Minister Julia Gillard commissioned David Gonski to report on education funding in Australia--the \\"Gonski Report\\". The Gonski Report identified a range of reforms to school funding with the aim of making the funding program more transparent. The implementation of these reforms has required negotiations and compromises with the Catholic school system. The school closed in 1976. the school and the toilet block still stood.

Runchey was an officer in the 1st Lincoln Militia when Major-General Sir Isaac Brock appointed him commander of the all-black Company. He served from the summer of 1812 when the Company was created until the fall of that same year.  Early life  Runchey was born in 1759 in Ireland and joined the British Army's 5th Regiment of Foot while it was stationed there. In 1774, around the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Regiment was sent to the American colonies where Runchey fought in battles such as Bunker Hill, Long Island, and Brandywine. His unit was then sent to Saint Lucia in 1778 and eventually traveled back to Ireland in 1780, where it remained until the end of the American Revolution in 1783. The Regiment was dispatched to Canada from 1787 to 1797 where Runchey and his wife, Eleanor/El√©onarde (n√©e Bonnat), settled. Their son, Robert Reuben, Jr., is listed as being born on the \\"Atlantic\\" on 22 December 1787, and was christened in the parish of Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu, Province of Quebec (later known as Lower Canada after 1791, now Qu√©bec) the next day. Runchey and Eleanor had another son, George, in the Province of Quebec (to become known as Upper Canada after 1791) in 1789, and Runchey was discharged from the Regiment in 1797. The government of Upper Canada granted Runchey land in Louth Township, Lincoln County, Upper Canada, just over 1.5 kilometres east of Jordan in 1791. There, Runchey opened and operated an inn and tavern that became a local landmark, serving as a coach stop since at least 1798. He and Eleanor had their youngest son, Thomas, in Upper Canada around this time.  War of 1812  At the beginning of the War of 1812, Runchey was serving as a Lieutenant in the 2nd Flank Company of the 1st Regiment of the Lincoln Militia. George was a sergeant in the same unit and Robert, Jr. acted as a private in the Niagara Light Dragoons. Runchey was not looked upon favourably by his fellow officers; on 8 June 1811, Colonel Ralfe Clench of the 1st Lincoln Militia described Runchey as > a worthless, troublesome Malcontent, it is rumord that he intents Personally > to wait on his Excellency the Lieutenant Governor, and to request his > acceptance of his resignation. This I sincerely hope he may do, and that his > Excellency may be pleased to accept of the same, as he is almost the only > one I can term a Black Sheep in our Regiment, and with whom the Officers I > believe would gladly part. Runchey did not resign from the Lincoln Militia, however, and in August 1812 Major-General Sir Isaac Brock chose him to lead Captain Runchey's Company of Coloured Men. = Captain Runchey's Company of Coloured Men = Richard Pierpoint was a former slave who had fought for the British during the American Revolution as part of the Butler's Rangers. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, he petitioned Major-General Sir Isaac Brock's administration to form an all-black military unit on the Niagara Frontier. The British initially rejected his proposal, seeing it as unneeded, but later agreed after 12 July 1812, when American Brigadier-General William Hull attempted to invade Canada across the Detroit River. The British had reservations about having a black man lead the unit and instead chose Runchey to take command. The Company was formed within the Lincoln Militia, and Runchey's son, George, also detached from the 2nd Flank Company to serve as a Lieutenant. The number of those in Runchey's Company varies by source and ranges from 27 to 50; men who wanted to join the Company met at Runchey's tavern. Runchey separated the black soldiers under his command from white militiamen, once court-martialling \\"a white soldier for fraternising with \\"his nigros [sic]\\"\\" on 15 September 1812. There are also cases of Runchey hiring out his men as servants for other officers. On one occasion, Runchey did not carry out his promise to give a militia surgeon a \\"black man\\" as a servant and received a formal complaint. Captain Runchey's Company of Coloured Men fought at Queenston Heights on 13 October 1812, though Runchey did not participate and Lieutenant James Cooper of the 2nd Lincoln Militia took command instead. There are no surviving records that show Runchey ever commanded his Company on the battlefield. Runchey resigned by 24 October 1812, though his son, George, remained with the unit. The Company went on to participate in battles such as Fort George and the Siege of Fort Erie and, after the war ended, disbanded on 24 March 1815.  Later life  Runchey went back to running his tavern after his resignation from the Company. He died sometime before 17 July 1819, when he was buried in St. Andrew's Anglican Churchyard in Grimsby, Upper Canada; the exact date of his death is unknown.

Hertzman published by Duke University Press in 2013. Hertzman's concern with the historical narrative surrounding how Samba became one of Brazil's most valuable cultural staples prompted him to write this book. By tracing the careers of Donga and Gilberto Gil from the late nineteenth century to the 1970s, Hertzman explores various themes such as intellectual property claims, popular music, race, gender, national identity, and the history of Afro- Brazilians in Rio de Janeiro, and how they all contribute to the making of Samba within the Brazilian State.  Synopsis  Hertzman's main argument in this book is that the historical narrative surrounding the emergence of samba in Brazil has either been over-criticized, or exceedingly fetishized. By using wide ranging evidence, such as Brazilian musicians' salary contracts, their involvement and activism with various musical associations, and their encounters with law enforcement, Hertzman explores their struggles in exerting their agency by claiming their music as what he calls, \\"intellectual property.\\" While Hertzman's book explores different themes such as \\"musical blackface\\" and \\"the purity of samba,\\" Hertzman discusses them within the context of Afro-Brazilian figures that were heavily involved with the progress of Samba so that his argument doesn't get off track.  Critical Reception  Making Samba: A New History of Race and Music in Brazil has been highly praised by a variety of historical scholars. Three critical reviews come from Charles A.

All of these scholars agree that Hertzman's work has been a big success in his field and that it \\"offers a substantial, indeed superb, contribution to the already robust literature about the birth of samba in the aftermath of slavery in Brazil and its rise to the status of national rhythm by the early twentieth century.\\" Perrone adds, \\"Even seasoned veterans of this subject will find some edifying surprises.\\"  Awards  The Latin American Studies Association awarded Making Samba Honorable Mention for the 2014 Bryce Wood Book Award. * Conrad Humanities Scholar (2017-2022) * New England Council of Latin American Studies Best Dissertation Prize (2009) * Fulbright-Hays (2004)  References  Brazilian music ","title":"Making Samba"},{"id":"56372058","text":"Serhiy Mykolayovych Ryzhuk (; born 20 January 1950, Chudniv, Ukraine) is a Ukrainian politician, member of the Verkhovna Rada.

The campaign launched in August 2017 with the ad titled \\"Banquet\\" which was set in medieval times. It became a catchphrase and resulted in increased sales, the production of further Bud Light ads broadcast during the American football playoffs and Super Bowl LII, and the popularizing of the phrase the \\"Pit of Misery\\" as well as characters such as the Bud Light King and the Bud Knight.  Prior use  Prior to the marketing ad, \\"dilly dilly\\" had been used as a recurring phrase and cadence in a 1700s nursery rhyme called \\"Lavender's Blue\\". Dictionary.com has defined the word \\"dilly\\" as \\"delightful\\" or \\"delicious\\". In 1985 the progressive rock band Marrillion released the song Lavender which references the nursery rhyme  Concept and first ad  The phrase was coined by Wieden+Kennedy art director N.J. Placentra and copywriter Alex Ledford while they were brainstorming ideas for a Bud Light commercial titled \\"Banquet\\". The phrase is used as a toast, much like \\"hear, hear\\" and \\"huzzah\\". Placentra said that ‚Äúit can also work as a greeting, a nod of approval, expression of gratitude, etc.‚Äù It was intended as a placeholder until something better came up. InBev chief marketing officer Miguel Patricio said in an interview at Business Insider's IGNITION conference that the phrase \\"doesn't mean anything. That's the beauty of it. I think that we all need our moments of nonsense and fun.\\" \\"Banquet\\" was filmed at a church in Manhattan, New York City. It began running in August 2017. Wieden+Kennedy wanted to do something timed with the Game of Thrones season finale. The story was set in medieval times, where subjects present gifts to the king and queen. As each one brings more cases of Bud Light, the king (portrayed by actor John Hoogenakker) expresses his approval with a toast. But when a visitor presents a \\"spiced honey mead wine\\", the king is offended, and banishes the visitor to the Pit of Misery. The \\"Dilly Dilly\\" phrase was originally intended to be spoken once, but after the client approved of the ad, their production director Jim Jenkins suggested using it more often. Patricio said that the ad did not test well, but thought consumers would get it, so they went against the research and gave it a chance, thinking that repetition would help.  Reception  \\"Banquet\\" was well received by audiences, who have used the \\"Dilly Dilly\\" phrase in wedding speeches and other celebratory toasts, and have created memes. NFL announcers have also used the phrase. In November 2017, Bud Light marketing vice-president Andy Goeler said that the campaign has attracted 100,000 searches per week on Google and about 45,000 per week on YouTube, and thinks it may be the next \\"Whassup?\\" phrase. NFL writers and fans have also used the terms to describe the teams. According to Goeler the campaign continues the \\"Famous Among Friends\\" concept from January 2017, and that the company would supplement the campaign with ads that aren't focused on humor and more on beer quality. Morgan Stanley attributes the increase in beer volume sales growth per month for Anheuser-Busch Inbev to the campaign, and that the company had gained market share for the first time since 2011. However, marketing executive Greg Butler from competitor MillerCoors said that beer sales for both brands have declined, and that Bud's marketing campaign was more about selling a meme instead of selling beer. The campaign won a Silver Lion for Social & Influencer award at the 2018 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.  Follow-up ads  For the football games that were playing on Thanksgiving Day, Bud Light released their second television ad, \\"Pit of Misery\\", which features a guy named Greg who returns to the Pit to share Bud Light with his fellow prisoners. On December 10, the ad \\"Handouts\\" was released, which promoted a sweepstakes for winning Super Bowl tickets for life. A trilogy of \\"Dilly Dilly\\" ads was announced. The first of the three, \\"Wizard\\", was broadcast for the NFL game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Houston Texans on Christmas Day. It featured a court magician who is asked to turn things into cases of Bud Light. The second ad in the trilogy \\"Ye Olde Pep Talk\\" aired for the AFC and NFC Championship games. For Super Bowl LII, Bud Light aired \\"Ye Olde Pep Talk\\" as well as debuting the third one in their trilogy titled \\"The Bud Knight\\". Bud Light also released web videos for each of the teams participating in the AFC and NFC Championships.  Later promotions  In March 2018, during the Loyola Ramblers men's basketball's NCAA tournament run, the Bud Light King delivered beers to fans. Bud Light also released a \\"Philly Philly\\" bottle-and-glasses package to commemorate the Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl LII win, and had the Bud Knight appear at their championship parade. Skywriting of the words \\"Philly Philly Dilly Dilly\\" was also shown during the parade. Other Dilly Dilly themed ads aired in 2018, including \\"Tapping Ceremony\\" in March, and \\"Redemption\\" in May, the latter of which Doug, the guy who was banished to the Pit of Misery, returns to offer the king and queen Bud Light Orange and Bud Light Lime. In May, Bud Light released a series of Dilly Dilly themed ads to promote the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In July 2018, Bud Light had a summer concert called Downtown Dilly Dilly at Elmwood Park in Roanoke, Virginia featuring country music singer Josh Turner. In September 2018, the television ad \\"A Royal Affair\\" was aired but without using the \\"Dilly Dilly\\" phrase. Bud Light VP of Marketing Andy Goeler said that they are trying to be careful not to overuse the phrase. The ad \\"Bud Lights for Everyone\\" was also aired for the college football and NFL seasons. At the start of the 2018‚Äì19 National Hockey League season in October, multiple arenas introduced Bud Light-sponsored penalty boxes for the opposing team carrying Pit of Misery branding. Some venues and announcers have also used the quote \\"To the Pit of Misery, Dilly Dilly\\" when a player is sent to the penalty box. Stadiums and arenas for various sporting events have also made the \\"Dilly Dilly Cam\\" a regular spot during game breaks, highlighting random home team fans who raise bottles of Bud Light.https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2018/09/06/sponsors-go- deep-with-nfl-plans.html The Bud Knight made cameos during a series of Tide ads during Super Bowl LIV.  Corn syrup allegations  At Super Bowl LIII, Bud Light aired a Dilly Dilly commercial where the Bud Light King receives a gigantic barrel of corn syrup; believing that it was misdelivered because Bud Light does not use corn syrup as an ingredient, they attempt to deliver it to Coors Light and Miller Lite instead. Corn syrup is used as a fermenting aid, where it is absorbed by yeast to help form alcohol. Bud Light uses rice in a similar manner instead. The commercial proved controversial: MillerCoors considered the ad to be an attack against the company: after the game, it took out a full-page ad in The New York Times to defend its use of corn syrup, stating that it is \\"a normal part of the brewing process and does not even end up in your great tasting can of Miller Lite\\". On March 21, 2019, MillerCoors sued Anheuser-Busch for false advertising, arguing that the commercial was attempting to mislead health-conscious consumers into thinking that corn syrup and/or high fructose corn syrup (a different substance that is not used in Coors Light or Miller Lite, but is used in selected AB products) is an ingredient present in the product as purchased, and alleging that the company diluted and damaged the goodwill of its trademarks. An Anheuser-Busch spokesperson called the lawsuit \\"baseless\\" and said it wouldn't deter Bud Light from \\"providing consumers with the transparency they demand.\\"  Use as a catchphrase  On November 16, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger called \\"Dilly Dilly\\" as an audible call in a game against the Tennessee Titans. The idea was credited to teammate Alejandro Villanueva The phrases \\"Dilly Dilly\\", \\"Pit of Misery\\", and \\"Bud Knight\\" have been registered as U.S. trademarks.Trademarks: When Modist Brewing Company in Minneapolis had advertised a Dilly Dilly IPA in December 2017, it received a cease-and-desist letter from Bud Light in the form of a scroll delivered and recited by a man in a medieval costume, where it said to keep the brew to a limited run, else they would be visiting the Pit of Misery. It also offered the company two \\"thrones\\" at the Super Bowl; representatives of the company thought it was funny and a cool way of handling the situation. In January 2018, Merriam Webster tweeted that their website has seen regular rises in lookups of the word \\"dilly\\" every Sunday. Villanova released a \\"Villy Villy\\" T-shirt to celebrate their 2018‚Äì19 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team's tournament win. In April 2018, the phrase was placed on the list of exclamations that would be banned from use at the Masters Tournament.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to fifteen small, dark purplish-black or green and purple flowers. Description Genoplesium morrisii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between three and fifteen dark purplish-black or green and purple flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are about long and wide and are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg- shaped, long and about wide with dark purpish-black stripes. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide and spread apart from each other. The petals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, about long and wide with a pointed tip. The labellum is lance-shaped, to narrow egg-shaped, about long, wide and vibrates in the slightest breeze. The sides of the labellum are lines with many coarse, spreading cilia and there is a narrow oblong callus in the centre of the labellum and extending about half way to its tip. Flowering occurs between January and April. Taxonomy and naming The bearded midge orchid was first formally described in 1931 by William Henry Nicholls who gave it the name Prasophyllum morrisii and published the description in The Victorian Naturalist. In 1989, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Genoplesium morrisii and in 2002 changed the name again to Corunastylis morrisii. The specific epithet (morrisii) honours \\"Mr. P.F. Morris of the National Herbarium, whose name I have bestowed upon this dainty little species\\". Distribution and habitat Genoplesium morrisii grows in forest, woodland and heath and is widespread and common in the southern half of Victoria. It is rarely encountered in Tasmania and possibly grows in the far south-east of New South Wales. Conservation Corunastylis morrisii is classed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. It is only known from a few near-coastal areas in the north and south where fewer than 100 mature plants are thought to survive. The main threats to the species in Tasmania are land clearing, inappropriate fire regimes and inappropriate disturbance.

It was also Jiang's second visit to Japan after succeeding General Secretary in 1989, following an earlier visit in April 1992. The goal of this state visit was to create a joint document with a forward-looking character that would set the path for Sino-Japanese relations in the 21st century. The visit was significant because it was the first visit to Japan ever made by the head of state of China. Both governments treated the Japan-China Joint Declaration On Building a Partnership of Friendship and Cooperation for Peace and Development‚Äîissued by the two governments on the occasion of visit‚Äîas a third important bilateral document, following the 1972 Joint Communiqu√© and the 1978 Treaty of Peace and Friendship. The two sides repeatedly have stressed that all problems should be handled in line with these three documents. China's expectations for this trip was high because in the previous month, South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung made his state visit to Japan which was considered successful. Despite high expectations, the state visit was considered a failure because Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Obuchi Keiz≈ç were unable to reach conclusive agreements on matters concerning history, Taiwan, and Japan's permanent membership in the UN Security Council. As a result, the Japanese public and media had a negative view towards Jiang, which ultimately hardened Japan's attitude towards China.  Historical Background = Sino- Japanese relations = Japanese public sentiments towards China dramatically faltered after the Tiananmen incident in 1989 and the demise of the Soviet Union that was a common enemy for Japan and China. According to a government survey, the percentage of those who held ‚Äúclose feelings‚Äù toward China dropped to 51.6% in October 1989 from 68.5% during the same period in 1988. Relations between the two states further declined when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted nuclear weapon tests from October 1993 to July 1996, despite fierce criticism from Tokyo. Taking into account public anger, deeply rooted in anti-nuclear feelings, Japan had no choice but to impose sanctions on China in the form of discontinuing ODA grants. It is believed that 1995-96 marked the lowest point of Sino-Japanese bilateral relations since 1972 - when the two countries normalized their relationship through the Japan-China Joint Communique. Realizing both sides‚Äô economic interdependence, a meeting between foreign ministers in September 1996 marked the beginning of attempts to improve Sino-Japanese relations. On April 6, 1992, Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (paramount leader), visited Japan and invited Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michito to visit China. = Origin of China's anti-foreign sentiments = Chinese nationalism is both a bottom-up movement as much as it is a top-down enactment. From the bottom-up perspective, Chinese nationalism is a belated response to the mistreatment of China by foreign states, stemming from the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 where the Japanese victory resulted in the loss of China's hegemonic status for the first time in history. A century of humiliation ensued which refers to the period of intervention and imperialism by the West and Japan until 1949. Furthermore, in the post-Cold War era, Chinese nationalism took form as mainly reactive sentiments, such as public protests, to foreign suppressions in modern history that gave rise to a sense of wounded national pride and an anti-foreign (particularly the U.S. and Japan) resentment. Many Chinese intellectuals gave voice to the rising nationalistic discourse in the 1990s. From the top-down perspective, Chinese nationalism in the 1990s was also a construction enacted by the Communist Party of China. Although there were no major military threats to China's security after the Cold War, the decay of Communist ideology gave rise to an internal legitimacy crisis that became a grave concern for the Chinese state. In response, China substituted performance legitimacy provided by surging economic development and nationalist legitimacy provided by invocation of the distinctive characteristics of Chinese culture in place of Marxist-Lenin and Mao Zedong Thought. In order to further perpetuate Chinese nationalism into the minds of children, the Communist government launched the patriotic education campaign after the Tiananmen incident in 1989. The patriotic education campaign was announced in 1991 and was fully functioning in 1994. Through educational reform, it fostered a sense of Chinese nationalism by warning of the existence of hostile international forces perpetuating imperialist insult to Chinese pride. This allowed the state to legitimize its authoritative rule on a non- Communist basis and ensured loyalty in a population that was otherwise subject to many domestic discontents. = Murayama statement = In 1995, Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama sought to express an apology that the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan had refused to issue for over 50 years. He took the initiative of drafting the statement that would be read at the 50th anniversary ceremony of WWII. It was the first time a government official issued an unambiguous apology for Japan's wartime actions. Murayama stated as follows: ‚ÄúDuring a certain period in the not too distant past, Japan, following a mistaken national policy, advanced along the road to war, only to ensnare the Japanese people in a fateful crisis, and, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology. Allow me also to express my feelings of profound mourning for all victims, both at home and abroad, of that history.‚Äù Beijing and other Asian capitals initially welcomed Murayama's statement acknowledging the apology. Prime Minister Obuchi used the Murayama statement to settle the fierce negotiations over the matter of historical recognition in the Joint Declaration with Korea and China. However at a November 1998 foreign ministers gathering in Malaysia, Chinese Minister Tang Jiaxuan stressed that the issues of historical recognition and Taiwan were central for issuing the Joint Declaration. China specifically demanded to bring the term ‚Äúapology‚Äù into the Joint Declaration. = Link to the October 1998 State Visit by South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung = In October 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung visited Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to issue a joint statement in Tokyo where Obuchi expressed his ‚Äúheartfelt apologies‚Äù to the Korean people for their suffering under Japanese colonial rule. Kim responded with ‚Äúsincere acceptance.‚Äù The statement was significant because it was the first written apology issued by Japan to any country after the atrocities of WWII. Kim's successful trip to Japan had raised Chinese expectations as President Jiang Zemin was scheduled to visit Tokyo in November 1998. An editorial in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post declared that ‚ÄúChina should get an apology every bit as profuse as Korea's.‚Äù  Description of the Visit  During the visit, President Jiang met Emperor Akihito, Empress Michiko, Prime Minister Obuchi and his wife, President of the House of Councillors, Speaker of the House of Representatives, leaders of main political parties, seven former Prime Ministers, and old friends and their families in Japan. Furthermore, President Jiang attended receptions hosted by seven organizations for friendship between Japan and China. He delivered a speech at Waseda University and visited not only Tokyo but also Sendai and Osaka. In an oral statement, Prime Minister Obuchi expressed his ‚Äúheartfelt apologies‚Äù to the Chinese people. While Emperor Akihito toasted Jiang at a state dinner, the Chinese and Japanese diplomats could not agree on the wording of their joint declaration. In the end, Japan only expressed ‚Äúdeep remorse‚Äù rather than ‚Äúheartfelt apologies‚Äù in the written document. The continued refusal by Obuchi to offer an apology led Jiang to lecture him on Japan's failings to appropriately address history. The signing ceremony was cancelled because neither Obuchi nor Jiang was willing to sign the document. In regards to the matter of Taiwan, after fierce negotiations, the Taiwanese section was cut down considerably to four lines, as both sides failed to gain ground on the issue.  Critical Response  The Japanese public and media had a negative view on the visit. This was largely because the Joint Declaration was not signed at an official signing ceremony and many major daily papers and television news broadcasts reported that it was because Jiang was not happy with the negotiations. Some acknowledged Obuchi's difficulty in offering an acceptable apology due to the pressure of the powerful anti-China and pro- Taiwan rightist groups in Japan, while protesters in Beijing immediately denounced Jiang for not getting a fuller apology from Obuchi. The largely negative reaction to Jiang's behaviour during the visit hardened Japan's attitude towards China, which would have more far reaching repercussions on the relationship of the two countries. Meanwhile, forums appeared overseas which admired Jiang's behaviour as showing national spirit and boldness of vision, especially in his speech at Waseda University. Nonetheless, Jiang's strong criticism of Japan was perceived to have failed, resulting in China to soften its rhetoric on Japan's treatment of its war history.  Stances on History = China = Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan wanted Tokyo to make a statement of ‚Äúapology‚Äù for past military aggression by using the term ‚Äúapology‚Äù into the Joint Declaration. During negotiations, a high ranking Chinese official in the Foreign Ministry told a Japanese counterpart that the Chinese would not continue to work on drafting a joint document unless Tokyo made an official apology in the document. Part of the reason why China chose to take a hard stance on the controversial issue of history was because President Jiang was under pressure to protect himself from conservative criticism, and he used the state visit as a vie for popularity with the Chinese people to solidify his legitimacy. His only claim to leadership thus far was being selected by Deng Xiaoping. = Japan = Obuchi refused to use the Murayama statement despite unbending demands by China to issue an official apology. This was because he thought that the Emperor Akihito's visit to China in 1992 where he said that he ‚Äúdeeply deplore(s) the ‚Äúgreat sufferings‚Äù Japan inflicted on the Chinese people during the war, was sufficient. Obuchi's deputy spokesman and one of his close aides, Akitaka Saiki, told Reuters after the meeting that Tokyo could not agree to a written apology similar to the one offering in South Korea because the cases were different. Obuchi also considered how issuing another apology to China would hurt the dignity of the Emperor which was not possible from the point of view of a conservative politician. Obuchi was also concerned with calls in his party, the LDP, to exclude the apology from the Joint Declaration. Most importantly, Obuchi failed to gain a critical concession from Beijing - by which China would announce that it would refrain from bringing up the issue of history at future summits. Considering the potential negative impacts on future Sino-Japanese relations, Obuchi offered a compromise, a verbal apology during the summit.  Stances on Taiwan = China = President Jiang Zemin urged Tokyo to abide by the 1972 joint communique in which reiterates that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China. This was crucial for Beijing because it wanted Tokyo to exclude the Taiwan Straits from the scope of the New Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation. Furthermore, Beijing was confident in convincing Japan because of a successful summit in June 1998 with US President Bill Clinton. = Japan = In response to China's demands, Obuchi said, ‚ÄúJapan's basic understanding is that China is a single entity. We have strictly maintained that position consistently. Our position of not supporting Taiwan's independence will not change from now on either.‚Äù However, Japan avoided confrontation with China on the matter of the new defense guidelines. This was because they believed that situations in the areas surrounding Japan, in which Japan could cooperate with US forces, are not based purely on geography. Furthermore, Tokyo wanted the Joint Declaration to reflect its hope for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan Straits issue, thereby aiming to restrain Beijing from using force over the Taiwan issue - but failed to do so.  Stances on Japan's Permanent Membership in the UN Security Council  Both sides agreed to include a section that stresses the importance of UN activity in the area of maintaining peace in the region, and for economic and social development throughout the world. = China = Since the beginning of the debate in the early 1990s, in regards to Japan's right to membership in the UN Security Council, China is the only country among the five permanent members of the Security Council to show hesitation. China refused to firmly support Japan's permanent membership in the joint statement. = Japan = Tokyo sought Chinese approval for Japan's permanent membership on the UN Security Council. Japanese policy makers believed that permanent membership would increase Japanese political influence in the region, thereby decrease Chinese influence in the region as well as in the Security Council.  Outcomes  * Issued the Joint Declaration of the Establishment of Partnership of Friendship and Cooperation for Peace and Development * Signed the Framework Cooperation Program for Exchanges Between Youth of China and Japan * Joint Communique Between China and Japan on Environmental Cooperation in the 21st Century * Agreement Between China and Japan on Exchanges and Cooperation in Science and Industrial Technology The documents which were in the form of a joint press communique, defined the nature of the relations between China and Japan, development of their friendly exchanges and cooperation in various fields in the 21st century, and identified all-around arrangements for the development. Japan pledged more than $3 billion in development loans to help with energy, transportation and environmental projects.  Future Developments  Despite growing anti-China feelings in the 1990s, trade between Japan and China increased dramatically. Total trade in 1999 amounted to $66 million, 33 times the amount in 1973, and nearly four times the amount in 1990. China has become Japan's second largest trading partner, while Japan has been China's largest trading partner for seven consecutive years. In an attempt to repair relations after Jiang's visit, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji visited Tokyo the next year and adopted a so-called 'smile diplomacy', avoiding any heavy criticism of Japan in regards to apologies. The visit in October 2000 helped to ease the impact of Jiang's visit, and served to protect China's economic interests vested in Japan. However, incidents such as Chinese maritime research activities and Chinese criticisms of Japanese history textbook controversies indicate that Sino- Japanese relations remain unstable. The Japanese public still tend to see China as a potential threat, and the continued resurfacing of demands for apologies from Japan has led to a state of ‚Äúapology fatigue‚Äù by the public, further hindering the progress beyond the two countries‚Äô past. On the other hand, China points to continued visits by Japan's Cabinet to the Yasukuni Shrine, where 14 Class A war criminals from World War II are enshrined, as showing insincere intentions to mend relations as they do not send the same message as the spoken remorse by Japanese Prime Ministers.

She is primarily known for designing scarves for prominent political figures, which she sold from her boutique in Alexandria, Virginia. After a career as a home economics teacher which spanned nearly two decades, Welch began working as a fashion consultant. Developing a clientele, she moved into designing accessories and then dresses. Welch was the designer of a dress worn by First Lady Betty Ford, which is now on display in the Smithsonian's First Ladies' Hall in the National Museum of American History. She also designed dresses on display at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library. Early life Mary Frances Barnett was born in 1923 in Rome, Georgia, to Eugenia (n√©e Morton) and James Wyatt Barnett. As a high school student, Barnett enjoyed fashion and consulted her friends on style. Her father worked for the telephone company and her family had deep roots in Georgia. She claimed to be 1/32 Cherokee; her great-grandfather built Georgia's first lumber mill and her grandfather served in the Confederate Army. Barnett graduated from Rome High School in 1941 and then enrolled at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. At the completion of her junior year, on June 3, 1944, Barnett married her childhood sweetheart, William Calvin Welch, in Rome, Georgia. After graduating from Furman, with her bachelor's degree, Welch continued her studies at the University of Georgia, before following her husband, who had been discharged from the military, to Wisconsin. There she studied design at the University of Wisconsin. Career First Lady Betty Ford's pink brocade gown by Frankie Welch, 1974 Welch began her career in Madison, Wisconsin, teaching elementary school and the couple had their first daughter, Peggy. When Bill was transferred to work with the CIA in 1952, the family moved to Washington, D. C. in 1953 and Welch continued teaching. She worked as a sewing instructor at the Washington and Lee High School in Arlington, Virginia and had her second daughter, Genie. In 1960, she designed a versatile dress known as \\"The Frankie\\", as an instructional aid to help her students visualize waistline treatments. That same year, Ingenue, a teen magazine named her the \\"Outstanding Home Economics Teacher of the Nation\\" and awarded her with a trip to visit the fashion houses of Paris and Rome. In September 1963, she opened a shop at 305 Cameron Street in Alexandria, Virginia, operating an official guest house on the upper floors and her clothing shop on the street level. The house was noted in guidebooks as a tourist attraction, because George Washington and his men dined there and it was the first bank in Virginia. By 1964, she was marketing \\"The Frankie\\" nationwide. The adaptable design came in various fabrics and hem-lengths, and could be worn in multiple ways, depending on how the waist ties were joined. Meeting Washington's elite women at various social functions, Welch began consulting with them on fashion. Developing a clientele, she soon switched to design. In 1967, as part of an initiative for the Native American education service, she designed a scarf featuring the Cherokee syllabary. Welch donated one dollar from the purchase of each scarf to the higher education fund of the Eastern Cherokee. The scarf caught the attention of First Lady Lady Bird Johnson. Johnson asked Welch to create a scarf which would promote her \\"Discover America\\" campaign. The scarf became a featured item at the first fashion show ever held at the White House. In 1968, she designed a scarf with a daisy pattern for the Republican National Convention and was then asked to design a scarf for Hubert Humphrey's presidential campaign featuring his HH logo. When Richard Nixon won the presidency, Welch was commissioned to design a scarf with his slogan \\"Forward Together\\" as a commemoration of his Inaugural. Official Portrait of First Lady Betty Ford in a Frankie Welch gown December 24, 1975 After the Nixon resignation in 1974, First Lady Betty Ford wore a Welch design to greet the press. Her official photograph was taken in a Welch design made of green silk, which Ford had brought back from China. That same year, she published Indian Jewelry: How to Wear, Buy and Treasure America's First Fashion Pieces, which was full of tips on how to determine the quality of jewelry and gave information about various types of materials used in jewelry design. She also designed a collection of contemporary bracelets, earrings and necklaces for her store. Her husband died in 1975. In 1976, when Ford selected which gown was to be presented to the First Lady's Hall, she selected a Welch dress in a princess style, with a Chinese-style high collar. The dress was first worn in 1975 for the Shah of Iran's state dinner and later worn by the First Lady to a dinner for King Juan Carlos I of Spain and Queen Sof√≠a in 1976. Welch designed Ford's official scarf, which she gave to visiting dignitaries, on a floral and polkadot background with the First Lady‚Äôs signature imprinted. Among Welch's corporate clients were McDonald's and Time-Life. She designed scarfs and tote bags for Auburn University, the University of Georgia and West Point and organizations like the Arkansas Democrats Association, the American Medical Association, the Congressional Wives' Club, the Princeton Club, the United States Marine Corps, and the United States Historical Society, as well as St Paul's Cathedral in London, The Indianapolis 500, and the Watergate Hotel. She designed a dress and a scarf with a peanut motif for Jimmy Carter's gubernatorial race; a scarf for the United States Bicentennial featuring the original 13 colonies; and a series of scarves depicting the official state flowers of all fifty states. She later designed scarves with the peanut featured for Carter's presidential run; scarves, ties, tote bags and umbrellas, for Ronald Reagan's inaugural festivities and a scarf for President Bill Clinton in 1993. Welch expanded her business, opening satellite stores in the D. C. area in the 1970s and consulted on interior design. She relocated to an apartment in the Watergate complex, but kept the Alexandria dress shop until 1982, when she sold it to her daughter Genie Welch so that she could focus more on designing. In 1990, the shop closed and Welch continued to design and teach courses on design for several years. She retired to Charlottesville, Virginia. In 2016, a dress designed for First Lady Betty Ford, part of the collection of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, toured the country in the Native Fashion Now exhibit sponsored by the National Museum of the American Indian's George Gustav Heye Center in Manhattan and the Peabody Essex Museum of Salem, Massachusetts. The pink brocade dress was designed for the 1974 White House Christmas Party.  References =CitationsBibliography= and      * External links *Gerald R.

It is the largest tannery in the city and one of the oldest. It is located in the Fes el Bali, the oldest medina quarter of the city, near the Saffarin Madrasa along the Oued Fes (also known as the Oued Bou Khareb). Since the inception of the city, the tanning industry has been continually operating in the same fashion as it did in the early centuries. Today, the tanning industry in the city is considered one of the main tourist attractions. The tanneries are packed with the round stone vessels filled with dye or white liquids for softening the hides. The leather goods produced in the tanneries are exported around the world.Chouara Tannery. Archnet. Retrieved January 22, 2018.Why You Need to Visit Fez in 20 Photos. Bloomberg. Retrieved January 22, 2018.Aziza Chaouni: Hybrid Urban Sutures: Filling in the Gaps in the Medina of Fez.\\" Archit 96 no. 1 (2007): 58-63.  History  Local tradition generally holds that the Chouara Tannery, as well as the Sidi Moussa Tannery southwest of the Zawiya of Moulay Idris, date from the city's foundation by Idris II (beginning of the 9th century). Historical texts make reference to the Sidi Moussa Tannery more definitely in the early 12th century, but the age of the Chouara Tannery is more unclear and the earlier history of either tannery is not firmly established. Modern historians have said that there isn't clear evidence for where the city's earliest tanneries were located but that tanneries did likely exist soon after the city's foundation and would likely have been located near the main river or near other natural water sources just as they are today. Historical sources show that the tanneries were a major industry even in the city's early history and tied to a large part of its economy. The products of the city's tanneries were also prestigious enough that they were reportedly exported all the way to Baghdad. Al-Jazna'i claims that the Almohads (late 12th to early 13th century) counted a total of 86 tanning workshops in the city, while a later source claims that there were around a hundred in the Marinid period (late 13th to 15th centuries). The tanneries, including the Chouara Tannery, continued to be expanded or modified on several occasions even into modern times. In addition to the Chouara and Sidi Moussa Tanneries, the Ain Azliten Tannery, located in the north of the city, was also created at the end of the 18th century. Description The most notable feature of Chouara and the other local tanneries is the numerous stone vats filled with different colored dyes and white liquids. Hides of cows, sheep, goats, and camels are processed by first soaking in a series of the white liquids ‚Äì made from various mixtures of cow urine, pigeon feces, quicklime, salt, and water ‚Äì in order to clean and soften the tough skins. This process takes two to three days and prepares the hides to readily absorb the dyes. They are then soaked in the dyeing solutions, which use natural colorants such as poppy for red, indigo for blue, and henna for orange. After the dyeing, they are dried under the sun. The resulting leather is then sold to other craftsmen, who use it to produce Morocco's famed leather goods, such as bags, coats, shoes, and slippers, prized for their high quality. The entire leather production process comprises manual labor only and involves no modern machinery, and has retained methods unchanged since medieval times.The Leather Tanneries of Fez, Morocco. Amusing Planet. Retrieved January 22, 2018.

Since the 19th century the tanneries have made extensive use of chromium in order to aid the tanning process. Certain types of chromium are toxic and the tanneries also produce various other organic wastes, which has resulted in large amounts of pollution contaminating the soil and the rivers downstream from the tanneries. Tannery workers and other locals have long complained of adverse health effects, with the most serious cases leading to cancer and early deaths. In the 21st century a widescale project, led by Aziza Chaouni, was launched to rehabilitate the Fez River by improving its urban environment and attempting to control the amount of pollution. At one point the project had proposed to end or curtail the operations of the Chouara Tannery and relocate the tanning industry to another location where its pollution could be managed more safely, while the tannery themselves would be converted to different economic model and potentially reused as a public space. In the end, however, the tanneries were restored and left in place.

Broadcast frequency  Upon opening in 1927, 3DB broadcast on the AM band at a wavelength of 254 metres, corresponding to a frequency of 1180 kHz. When seven new Australian broadcasting licences were issued in 1935, including 3XY in Melbourne, most Melbourne stations were allocated new broadcast frequencies; 3DB was allocated 1030 kHz. Until 1978 there was a 10 kHz gap between radio stations. However, the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 changed this to a 9 kHz gap, thus allowing more stations on the AM band. Therefore, on 23 November 1978, most Australian stations changed their frequencies and 3DB went to 1026 kHz.List of Australian AM radio stations, scroll down to 3DB  History = On air times = 3DB was awarded its broadcast licence in 1925 but did not immediately come on air due to debates in Federal Parliament as to whether or not Australia should proceed with the then-unique system of A Class (later ABC) and B Class (later commercial) stations.Griffen-Foley, Bridget, Changing Stations: The Story of Australian Commercial Radio, UNSW Press, 2009, Sydney The station eventually made its on-air debut on 27 February 1927 in a fairly low-key manner. In the 1920s, at most stations including 3DB, it was not unusual for there to be breaks between programs during which the station temporally closed down. Sometimes these breaks were of 30 minutes' duration; sometimes longer. However, within just a few years, such breaks were eliminated and 3DB (and most other Melbourne commercial stations) broadcast for set times during each day. By 1934, 3DB was on air at the following times: * 7.00 am to 11.30 pm Monday-Friday; * 7.00 am Saturday to 1.00 am Sunday; * 10.00 am to 12.30 pm Sunday; * 2.30 pm to 10.00 pm Sunday.Radioprogram, first edition, 14 July 1934 Between 12.30 and 2.30 pm on Sundays all mainstream Melbourne commercial stations were required by the Postmaster-General's Department to close down. Amateur radio stations which normally broadcast on the shortwave band were permitted to use the medium wave (AM) band during these hours. 3AK which usually only broadcast after other Melbourne stations had closed down, also broadcast between these two hours. ABC stations 3AR and 3LO did not take the break between 12.30 and 2.30 on Sunday afternoons. This arrangement appears to have been exclusive to Melbourne. By the Post-war era, 3DB's hours had been extended to: * 6.00 am to 11.30 pm Monday-Friday; * 6.00 am Saturday to 1.00 am Sunday; * 8.00 am to 10.30 pm Sunday. In the 1930s, the Postmaster- General's Department issued 24-hour licences to one station in each capital city market except Melbourne. In Melbourne, since 1931, 3AK had been broadcasting almost exclusively in the early-morning hours when other stations were off the air. However, on 1 February 1954, 3AK began broadcasting exclusively during hours of daylight, and concurrently 3DB, 3UZ and 3XY were all given 24-hour licences, but both 3DB and 3UZ had ceased all-night broadcasting within six months. 3DB's hours on the air then became: * 5.30 am Monday-Saturday to 1.00 am the following day; * 7.00 am Sunday to 1.00 am Monday. However, 3DB was again broadcasting 24 hours per day by the mid-1960s. = DB = Druleigh Business = The station was originally owned by Druleigh Business and Technical College Pty Ltd, and the original licence was in the name of Edgar Sayer, principal of the college,McLaughlin, Bill, From Wireless to Radio: The 3DB Story, The Herald and Weekly Times Limited Melbourne, 1985 hence the callsign \\"DB\\". The original studios were located on the 10th floor of Capitol House, above the Capitol Theatre, Swanston Street, Melbourne. When 3DB eventually made its on-air debut on 27 February 1927, the first program was the children's session conducted by Winnie Wattle, at 6.30 pm. The official opening was at 8.00 pm when announcer Frank Pearson introduced Edward Haynes, Managing Director of Druleigh and 3DB, who said: \\"This is Melbourne's new 'B' class station, which is the first in Australia to carry out the American idea of making revenue from advertisements\\". (Even so, the station made a small loss in its first six months.) Despite the claim, in 1927, that 3DB would be the first station to make revenue from advertisements, 2UE had been broadcasting advertisements since 1925. Others appearing on opening night were Will Davey, tenor; Mrs Henry Johnson, contralto; Billy Meeske, speaking on 'Wrestlers I Have Known'; Len Gibson's Neapolitan Sextet; Edna Johnson, reciting from Shakespeare; Elsie Watkins, soprano; and accompanist, Jess Prideaux. = Herald ownership = From 14 June 1929https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/History_of_wireless_telegraphy_and_broadcasting_in_Australia/Topical/Publications/Australian_Radio_History/Vic_AM_Stations until late in 1987, 3DB was owned and operated by The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd (HWT), owners of The Herald and The Sun News-Pictorial. Also in 1929, the studios and offices were moved from Capitol House, and 3DB took sole occupancy of 74 Flinders Street, to the east of the HWT building on the corner of Flinders and Exhibition Streets. One of the studios was an auditorium accommodating live audiences, and this became a popular venue for Melbournians and the focus for the many live variety programs which the station broadcast throughout the 1930s to 1960s. In 1966 the HWT truck dock was expanded, and in the process 74 Flinders Street was pulled down, with the station then moving to 61 Flinders Lane, immediately behind the HWT building. One of the most important people in 3DB's history was David Thomas Worrall, who was appointed manager of the station by the Herald and Weekly Times Sir Keith Murdoch in 1929, and who was to remain as manager until 1958. He was responsible for introducing many big budget programs which, inter alia, made 3DB the top station in all Melbourne radio surveys for many decades. Worrall also formed the Major Broadcasting Network, with associated stations throughout Australia. From its formation in 1938 until its closure in the late 1970s, the Major Network was usually recognised as being second in importance after its rival, the Macquarie Radio Network. In 1930 Worrall helped to form the Australian Federation of \\"B\\" Broadcasting Stations, now Commercial Radio Australia, and he was its Federal President in 1938. Probably the longest-serving 3DB employee was Geoff Palmer who commenced as an announcer in 1929. He was a member of the Australian Society of Authors and his writing ability led to him being promoted to the continuity department. Palmer was the 3DB advertising manager when he retired in 1973. In the late 1920s until the 1950s, 3DB tried to produce programming that would appeal to the whole of the population, at least part of the time. Musically, this ranged from classical music through to pop music, including the hit parade; much of the music being live. News and news commentaries were also important, as were live descriptions of sport. 3DB was a major broadcaster of radio drama, including soap operas, much of this being produced by 3DB itself. The station produced and broadcast a wide range variety shows, including quizzes. 3DB (like most other stations) also broadcast a wide variety of women's programs during the day, and children's sessions in the early evening. The broadcasting of this broad range of programming came to an end in the 1960s, mainly due to two factors. The first was the formal introduction of television in Australia in 1956. The second was the gradual replacement of the radio valve with the transistor. These made radios both more portable and much cheaper, meaning that every member of the family was now able to have his/her own radio set, rather than imitating the clich√©d image of the whole family sitting around the family's single radio receiver.numerous issues of Listener-In, Radioprogram, Radio Times (Melbourne); ABC Weekly The National Film and Sound Archives has issued an on- line list of radio programs from the 1930s to the 1970s, that are in their holdings. This list contains many dozens of 3DB programs.file:///C:/Users/alber/Downloads/nfsa_radio_series_collection_amended.pdf = The Smileaway Club = During the pre-TV era most Australian radio stations instigated some form of radio club partly as a way of keeping listeners tuned to that particular station. 3DB's Smileaway Club was one of Australia's most successful, with more than 50,000 members at its peak. The club started in 1929, when David Worrall was managing the station, but before the studios were moved away from Capitol House. The club lasted until the late 1950s. For some decades a short session, Smileaway Club Notes, was broadcast each weekday at 8.40 am, and again as a lead-in to the top rating, major news bulletin at 7.00 pm. These sessions featured live music and invitations to events such as theatre parties, bay trips, dances, visits to the zoo, hikes, fancy dress balls. Free or cheap passes to theatres, ice skating, etc., were offered to members. Various charities were also supported. The club had its own theme tune, and a commercial recording of the theme was made in the early 1930s featuring high-profile 3DB comedians/announcers, Charlie Vaude and Renn Millar  the informal style is typical of the Smileaway Club. For many years, membership was one shilling (10¬¢) per annum. The club issued its own badge, which is now quite collectable. Over the years, many 3DB personalities were associated with the club, in particular: Geoff Palmer, Iris Turnbull, Dorothy Silk, Charlie Vaude, Renn Millar, Sir Eric Pearce, Eric Edgley, Clem Dawe, Cedric Zahara, Dick Cranbourne and Peter Surrey. A Junior Smileway Club conducted children's parties on Saturday mornings in the 3DB auditorium, featuring community singing, games and quizzes. = Early experiments in transmitting vision = In 1929, 3DB along with 3UZ, Melbourne, and 2UE Sydney, participated in experimental television broadcasts using the Radiovision system. 3DB also experimented with the Baird system. These experiments were conducted late at night after the station had officially closed down. Only a handful of people would have had equipment capable of picking up these transmissions, which were mainly designed for those directly involved in these trials into nascent television broadcasts. = News theme = In the pre-television era, nearly all Australian radio stations had their own distinctive news themes. From the early 1930s until the 1970s 3DB used \\"Heart of Oak\\" as its news theme. \\"Heart of Oak\\" was the official march of the Royal Navy, and some other navies. Until recently, it was the Royal Australian Navy's official march. By the 1960s 3DB was using a Columbia recording of the march, played by the Orchestra of the Royal Marines, conducted by Sir Vivian Dunn. The main news bulletins at 7.45am, 12.30pm and 7.00pm used the first minute the theme, whilst other bulletins only used a smaller section. The version used by 3DB can be downloaded.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7Shm7C91IY = From \\"Rickety Kate\\" to \\"Rehearsal for TV\\" - the Story of Test Cricket broadcasts, and of The Happy Gang = Test Cricket  In 1930, test cricketer Don Bradman was a household name throughout Australia. There were even people who incorrectly believed that the call-sign 3DB was based on Bradman's initials. Bradman's popularity led to great interest in the 1930 Ashes series in England, in which he played a major role. In 1930 it was not possible to broadcast descriptions of the games back to Australia. However, 3DB played upon the interest and broadcast cricket updates from England, accompanied by nightly variety programs. The cricket updates were provided by international telegrams or cables, from England to Australia, sent at the daunting rate of six shillings (60¬¢) per word. In 1930 the male average wage was A¬£7 ($14), with the female average wage being less than half of that. This meant that a cable of just 20 words cost the equivalent of the male average wage. The variety was provided was provided in front of a live audience by 3DB staff members led by Charlie Vaude and Renn Millar, and accompanied by guest artists. The 1930 broadcast was the first pairing of Vaude and Millar, a pair that was to go onto be one of 3DB's most listened-to comedy pairs. The highlight of the programs was their informality which certainly added to the appeal. 3DB originally planned to stay on air until midnight, but on the first night 3DB manager, David Worrall, asked: \\"is anyone listening?\\" The 3DB switchboard was flooded with calls, followed by thousands of letters and 500 telegrams. After that, the broadcasts continued until stumps, which was usually at about 3.30 am. 3DB continued to provide similar broadcasts for all of the Ashes games played in England in 1930, 1934, 1938, 1948, 1952 and 1956. (There was no test cricket during World War II.) Over the years commentators included Ron Casey, Lindsay Hassett, Bill Johnston, Ernie McCormick, Keith Rigg, Jack Ryder, Eric Welch and Bill Woodfull. In later years, the programs were hosted by versatile 3DB announcers, Dick Cranbourne (who was also a singer), and John Stuart. As well as Australia v England tests, a similar style of programming was also provided for a number of other overseas Test Matches played in the evening/night, Australian time. One example of this were the 1936 South Africa v Australia Tests.Radioprogram 15‚Äì21 February 1936 Sitting in front of the audience in the 3DB auditorium was a doll known as Ricketty Kate. Whenever an important cable came through from the cricket, the doll's eyes would light up and the audience would break into the chorus of \\"We won't worry. We don't care. Who's afraid of the big brown bear?\\" It is rumoured that the name, Ricketty Kate, was based on the name of a well-known Melbourne prostitute of the time. These programs were relayed to a number of interstate stations. The already great interest in cricket was exacerbated by the English tour of Australia in 1932-33 and the subsequent Bodyline scandal. As well as 3DB again providing coverage of the 1934 tour of England, this also resulted in nearly every Australian radio station providing some coverage. Most commercial stations provided a format based on 3DB's successful 1930 coverage, with cricket updates being provided by cable, interspersed with variety programming. Most capital city stations provided their own entertainment, with many of these stations relaying it to country stations.various radio magazines in the collection of Albert Isaacs, Melbourne The ABC, then only two years' old, provided a so-called synthetic coverage, with announcers in the studio providing a commentary based on cables from England, but to all intents and purposes sounding as if they were actually at the game in England. 3DB's 1952 cricket broadcasts were so popular that the station management looked at ways of making the informal variety section a permanent feature of the station's schedule. This led to the initiation of The Happy Gang...  The Happy Gang  Originally subtitled REHEARSAL FOR TV, the program was broadcast in peak listening time, from 8.30 to 10.00 every Monday evening, from 1953 until 1962. Until the inevitable lure of TV cut into The Happy Gang audience, it was one of Australia's most popular programs, being relayed across the country on the Major Broadcasting Network. The program was initially produced by Norm Spencer. It was originally hosted by the cricket hosts Dick Cranbourne and John Stuart. Cranbourne was later joined as host by Bill Collins and Jack Perry. Other regulars in the show included Eula and Mary Parker, June Hamilton, Shirlene Clancy, Rod McLennan, Lou Toppanno, Tom Davidson, Charles Skase and Stan Stafford, and special guests including artists of the calibre of Winifred Atwell. The show usually began with a series of calls for listeners with a particular talent to come into the studio. Dick Cranbourne would say something like: \\"Tonight we're calling for the biggest leek - and a plumber\\". Dozens of people dropped what they were doing and brought in their vegetables, whilst plumbers also arrived replete with spanners and wrenches. Other examples included: school children and grandfathers; barbers and butchers; violinists; Antarctic explorers; bathroom baritones and shower sopranos; those with monkeys, or Alsatians; \\"the biggest aspidistra in the world\\" - the list goes on. One night, there was a call for choir boys, which resulted in a 14-year-old Ernie Sigley making his first visit to the station where he was later to work. The original subtitle, \\"Rehearsal for TV\\" was in many respects shown to be true after the introduction of TV in Melbourne in 1956. Producer Norm Spencer was to be employed at GTV-9 where he made his name as producer of In Melbourne Tonight. Before Graham Kennedy was employed as compere of I.M.T., Spencer had suggested Dick Cranbourne. Bill Collins became the popular host of HSV-7's variety program Sunnyside Up. Jack Perry made his name as Zig of Zig and Zag, also on HSV-7. = The Minstrel Show = One of the most popular programs heard on 3DB was The Minstrel Show, which commenced in 1931 and continued into the 1960s. This was an Australian radio version of an American minstrel show. It was broadcast on 3DB every Thursday evening, and was relayed to Major Broadcasting Network affiliates, as well as some independent stations. The program was originally sponsored by the Akron Tyre Company who were also founders of 3AK, but within a short period of time sponsorship was taken over by optometrists Coles and Garrard, whose name was then incorporated into the program's title. When C & G ceased their sponsorship of the program in the 1960s, broadcasts of new programs ceased, but 3DB ended the long-running show by playing a number of transcriptions of programs from the 1930s. Personalities associated with the C & G's Minstrel Show include Cecil Atkinson, Mervyn Bray, Carl Briglia, Agnes Brown, Reg Brown, Herbert Browne, Walter Burleigh, Maurice Callard, Fred Collier, Colin Crane, Dick Cranbourne, Joe Delany, Alice Dolphin, Fred Ford, Paul Gaving, John Hartley, Cyril Hambley, Don Humphries, Ernest Kopke, Geoff McComas, Jock McLachan, Hec McLennan, Renn Millar, Bert Miller, Bert Munyard, Mark Sutherland, Keith Neilson, Mabel Nelson, Sir Eric Pearce, Bill Rhodesbury, Frank Rich, Stan Shields, Charles Skase, William Smith, Guy Stavordale, Peter Surrey, Mark Sutherland, Lou Toppano, Charlie Vaude, George Ventura, Frank Walsh, Monty Walters, and Ernest Wilson. = Horse racing = In 1934, 3DB lured Eric Welch over from the ABC. He provided a number of 3DB programs and was particularly known for his annual coverage of Melbourne's Anzac Day march. He was also a regular panellist on the Australian version of Information Please. However, probably his most important contribution at 3DB was to instigate the coverage of all Victorian races, as well networking with stations around Australia, so that interstate races were also covered by 3DB. He was 3DB's senior race-caller for 20 years. One of the most important 3DB racecallers was Bill Collins who joined the station in 1953 and followed Eric Welch as 3DB's senior racecaller. At various times other stations vied with 3DB in this field, in particular 3AW, 3XY, 3UZ and the ABC. The last station to share racing coverage with 3DB was 3UZ. However, in 1983, 3UZ revamped its program lineup and cancelled all horse racing coverage, leaving 3DB as the sole outlet for racing on Melbourne radio. 3DB adopted the slogan Racing Radio and devoted much of its programming to horse racing. In 1987 the Victorian racing industry, through the Totalisator Agency Board (TAB), purchased 3UZ and took over exclusive rights to horse racing coverage from 3DB, effective from February 1988. For many years 3DB used the march, Grandstand, by Keith Mansfield as the theme to its racing coverage. The version used by 3DB (at least in the 1960s) was a Chappell recording featuring the Queens' Hall Light Orchestra conducted by Robert Farnon.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqALK_VC1mE = 3DB/3LK = On 16 May 1936 3DB purchased 3HS Horsham, Victoria for and on behalf of the HWT. On 24 December 1936, the call sign was changed to 3LK and, at this time, the Horsham studios and transmitter were closed with the transmitter being relocated to the small village of Lubeck,Walker, R.R., The Magic Spark: 50 Years of Radio in Australia, 1973, The Hawthorn Press, Melbourne hence the 3LK call sign. 3LK did not have a local Wimmera studio, and the vast majority of its programming was relayed from 3DB. There was, however, about one or two hours per day of local programming, which came from the 3LK studio in the 3DB Melbourne building, utilising 3DB announcing staff. 3LK supported numerous local Wimmera/Mallee events and charities. The slogan used for all 3DB/3LK programming during most of this era was: 3DB Melbourne, 3LK Central Victoria, the Herald-Sun stations, but towards the end of the DB/LK partnership this was modified to the more logical: 3DB Melbourne, 3LK Wimmera Mallee, the Herald- Sun stations. The HWT sold 3LK on 1 February 1972Carty, Bruce, On the Air: Australian Radio History, privately published, 2011, Gosford, N.S.W. and its studios and transmitter were again moved to Horsham. In 1977 there was yet another name change when 3LK Horsham became 3WM Wimmera Mallee, broadcasting from Horsham. = World War II = It was Sunday evening 3 September 1939 and 3DB was broadcasting a radio drama in the very popular and long-running Lux Radio Theatre series. The performance of Leah Kleschna was suddenly interrupted by the voice of the Prime Minister, The Rt. Hon. Robert Menzies announcing that Australia was now at war with Germany. Censorship was rife during the war, particularly after the U.S. entered the conflict on 7 December 1941. After General Douglas MacArthur set up his headquarters in Australia, he wielded enormous power, including on matters of censorship. Inter alia, he declared that every Australian radio station would only broadcast three news bulletins per day and that these would be simultaneous at 7.45 am, midday and 7.00 pm. During this time, the highest rating news in Melbourne was that of 3DB. Weather forecasts were banned because it was felt that this may assist the enemy. Noticesthese were D-Notices in everything but name, even though that name had been used in the U.K. since 1912. The actual term was first used in Australia in 1952. were issued banning radio stations from broadcasting some major wartime events, but as the federal government didn't have the same power over the printed press as it did over radio, newspapers usually reported events that radio was not permitted to mention. There was some talk of closing down all commercial radio stations, as the enemy could beam-in on the transmitters and use these as bombing targets. As it transpired, this did not happen. However, some stations (not 3DB) were closed down for 24 hours as punishment for perceivably ignoring bans on radio reporting particular news items. Nevertheless, 3DB was off the air for an hour or so during an air raid drill during which all DB staff were ushered into a Flinders Lane warehouse that housed piles of mattresses. Despite this, fears were expressed that 3DB may not be really ready should there be a genuine air raid. Many sponsors donated their advertising time to patriotic appeals. 3DB was also badly affected by staff enlisting. 3DB personality Keith Smith became a broadcaster at 9AD Labuan, Borneo, attaining the rank of sergeant. Norm Spencer was also at 9AD, joining the staff of 3DB after the war, as a producer. Smith and Spencer were only two of dozens of radio personnel who took up positions at the 20 Australian military radio stations throughout the Pacific. The supply of overseas programs was virtually cut off during the war, particularly from the U.S., meaning that Australian stations and networks had to produce more local programs. This was particularly the case at 3DB and the Major Broadcasting Network. 15 August 1945 was VP (Victory in the Pacific) Day; a day often described as the day the lights went on all over the world. 3DB listeners heard the joyous news reported by Eric Pearce and Eric Welch. = Bob Dyer at 3DB = Robert Neal Dyer OBE, born Robert Dies in Hartsville, Tennessee, U.S.A. in 1909, made visits to Australia on a couple of occasions in the late 1930s and 40s as a member of the Marcus Show which toured the Tivoli circuit and the Princess Theatre, with Dyer performing a hillbilly and ukelele act. In 1940, 3DB manager David Worrall employed Dyer to star in a series of 26 shows called The Last of the Hillbillies, broadcast on Saturday nights at 7.15. His later radio career commenced in 1948. He was then stationed in Sydney and broadcast programs for the Major Broadcasting Network from venues throughout Australia. Programs such as Pick a Box from 1948, and Winner Take All were thus heard on Major's Melbourne outlet, 3DB. In these programs, his co-host was his wife, Dolly Dyer. In 1951, Dyer transferred from the Major Network to the Macquarie Radio Network where he joined his friend and major rival Jack Davey. The so-called feud between the two friends was mainly contrived for promotional purposes. From 1957, many of his radio programs were simulcast on TV and radio through Sydney station ATN and its then-sister station GTV in Melbourne. When Dyer's programs were broadcast on 3DB, they usually topped the ratings, even though they were often purposely transmitted at the same times as the Macquarie Network were broadcasting Jack Davey programs. = Good Friday Appeal = In 1942, Keith Murdoch, as managing director of HWT, agreed with the Royal Children's Hospital Good Friday Appeal organisation that The Herald would promote the appeal and that it would be broadcast on radio station 3DB. Things associated with the appeal were virtually the only things broadcast by 3DB on Good Friday, with personalities acknowledging donations on air, interspersed with entertainment and interviews from the hospital. 3DB played a major part in promoting the appeal, with the sums raised annually increasing dramatically from 1942 onwards. Figures published by the appeal management (converted to decimal currency) show that during the first 11 years of the appeal, an average of about $2,124 per annum was raised, but when 3DB joined the appeal in 1942 the amount collected during that one year rose to $16,620, an increase of approximately 800 percent. In 1943, the amount donated had already risen to over $25,000 and to over $37,000 in 1944. The amount of monies collected for the hospital has continued to rise steadily to this day. There have been some very minor, aberrant dips in the amounts raised and, ironically, one of these small decreases occurred in 1957, the year that Channel 7, then also owned by HWT, joined the appeal. The amounts raised in 1953 ($263,493) and 1954 ($312,000) were then world record amounts for radiothons. 3TT and 101.1 TT-FM, successors to 3DB, continued to support the appeal for a few years, but the radio voice of the appeal is now 3AW. To put the Good Friday Appeal into context, prior to the television era, all Melbourne commercial radio stations (except 3AK which mainly broadcast during the early hours of the morning) conducted appeals for various charities. 3AW conducted a Mothers' Day Appeal for the Royal Women's Hospital; 3KZ's Christmas Day Appeal and its Christmas Eve broadcasts of Carols by Candlelight supported both the Austin Hospital and the blind babies; the 3UZ appeal was for the Red Cross; and 3XY supported the Brotherhood of St Laurence. = Stephanie Deste = Stephanie Deste was an actor, dancer, beautician and radio broadcaster. For many years she was well known as one of Melbourne's eccentrics. Just after arriving in Australia in the late 1920s, Stephanie Deste broadcast Bible stories on the Australian Broadcasting Company, predecessor of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Wireless Weekly magazine, 4 January 1929; on-line edition - https://www.americanradiohistory.com/AUSTRALIA/Archive-Wireless-Weekly- AU/1929/Wireless-Weekly-1929-01-04.pdf Her many quirks were particularly highlighted when she recommenced broadcasting, on 3UZ just after World War II, presenting beauty hints and live advertisements for her beauty salons during the morning women's programs. In the late 1940s, Stephanie Deste transferred to 3DB where she continued to broadcast until the early 1960s. As well as regular appearances in the morning programs, from 1954 she presented a half- hour program, Sunday Night with Stephanie Deste at 10.30 pm on a Sunday night. The program was sponsored by the Stephanie Deste Pty Ltd beauty salons. It is believed that this time-slot was the cheapest offered by 3DB at the time. As discussed above, as from 1 February 1954, 3DB began broadcasting 24 hours per day. Prior to this, the station had closed at 10.30 pm on Sundays. 24-hour broadcasting at 3DB only lasted for a few months, and after this 3DB began closing at 1.00 am every morning. Every evening, a two-hour program called \\"The Dunlop Hours, Eleven 'til One\\" was broadcast after 11.00 pm. This meant that as from 1 February 1954, there was a half-hour gap in programming after 10.00 pm on Sundays, which is why Stephanie Deste was able to get this time- slot at very cheap rates. The program mainly consisted of interviews with show business personalities, both locals but, particularly, with artistes visiting from overseas. However, this eccentric program was usually more about Stephanie Deste than about the people she was interviewing. Despite its late time-slot, Sunday Night with Stephanie Deste was popular with show-biz aficionados. = Football = As from 1950, 3DB provided football commentaries on Saturday and holiday afternoons; then the only times that AFL football was played. These broadcasts continued until 1987 when 3DB, as such, ceased to exist. Nevertheless, the broadcasting of races always took precedence over the football at 3DB. Whenever a race commenced, the station would cross to the racecourse, irrespective of what was happening on the football field. (This was also the case at Melbourne's other two racing stations at that time, i.e. 3AR and 3UZ). The popularity of football in Melbourne is illustrated by the fact that in 1962, the only station not broadcasting the football was 3AR, then the ABC's classical music station. In 1944, a 16-year-old Ron Casey joined 3DB as a turntable operator. He was soon promoted to Eric Welch's sporting department. Before moving to television, Ron Casey was to broadcast a wide variety of sports including: football, boxing, wrestling, ice hockey, athletics (especially the Stawell Gift), golf and a number of Olympic Games. In 1950 Casey, along with George Andrew were the first to broadcast football over 3DB. Others involved in DB's football coverage over the years included Sam Loxton, Dennis Cometti, Rex Hunt and, most importantly, Lou Richards who also broadcast at other times, including the Saturday breakfast session. = Drama = Crawford Productions  Hector Crawford was the brother of 3DB manager and administrator Curteis Crawford, and also brother to Dorothy Crawford. He was married to soprano Glenda Raymond. Dorothy Crawford was married to 3DB announcer and producer Roland Strong. Hector Crawford was manager of Broadcast Exchange of Australia (BEA) prior to the mid-1940s when he formed his own production company in which Dorothy Crawford played a prominent role. Prior to the television era most of the Crawford productions were produced for 3DB and relayed to radio stations across Australia. The program ending featuring the voice of Roland Strong: \\"produced in the studios of Hector Crawford (pause) by Dorothy Crawford\\" was often heard on 3DB, with Strong placing the emphasis on the name of his wife, as heard in the attached episodes of D24.https://archive.org/details/d24_20191228/A+Boy%2C+A+Horse+And+A+Gun. One of its most prestigious programs was Melba, the story of Dame Nellie Melba, with Glenda Raymond singing in the lead role, and Patricia Kennedy in the speaking role of Melba. The program was first broadcast in 1948, two years before Raymond and Crawford were married. Melba was followed by two other music-based dramas, The Blue Danube and The Amazing Oscar Hammerstein. Consider Your Verdict was broadcast on 3DB from 1958 to 1960, and was simulcast over HSV-7. The police drama D24, heard on 3DB, is generally believed to have been the inspiration behind later Crawford TV dramas such as Homicide, Division 4, Matlock Police and Cop Shop. Amongst the many soap operas produced by Dorothy Crawford, and also broadcast by 3DB, were Sincerely Rita Marsden, A Man Called Sheppard, Here Comes O'Malley, John Turner's Family, Women in Love and Prodigal Father.  Other notable radio theatre = Dad and Dave: a well-loved and well-remembered Australian serial = One of the most iconic of Australian radio serials was Dad and Dave (sometimes referred to as Dad and Dave from Snake Gully). Set in the fictional rural town of Snake Gully, it certainly appealed to city-dwellers, many of whom hankered for life in the Australian bush; a lifestyle that may or may not ever have existed. George Edwards, arguably the most important figure in Australian radio drama, played the lead role of Dad; he was also the producer, and played many of the supporting roles. John Saul played Dave, with Nell Stirling, George Edwards' third wife, in the role of Mabel. At different stages, Loris Bingham and Hope Suttor took the role of Mum. Dad and Dave was first heard in Melbourne in 1937 on 3DB but, over the decades, was heard on a number of stations and is still heard from time to time on radio nostalgia programs. The first episode is available on YouTube A collection of 23 episodes are also available through the U.S. nostalgia website Old Time Radio. = From the U.S. to Australia = Another popular drama series heard on 3DB (and other Major Broadcasting Network stations) was the Australian version of the one hour U.S. program Lux Radio Theatre which was broadcast at 8.00 pm every Sunday night in the 1940s & 50s. High-profile actors were used. It toured various halls around Australia, and was performed in front of live audiences. Prior to World War II, 3DB and the Major Broadcasting Network imported a number of programs, on transcription discs, particularly from the U.S. After the U.S. entered the War (see above), it became impossible to import such discs. However, in many cases, scripts were imported and Australian versions were made,Richard Lane, The Golden Days of Australian Radio Drama. 1923-1960, 1994, National Film and Sound Archive CanberraMimi Colligan, Golden Days of Radio, 1991, Australia Post Philatelic Group often replete with Australian actors with phoney American accents. An Australian version of When a Girl Marries was heard at 7.15 pm on weeknights after the major 7.00 pm news and news commentary, and ran for 19 years.commencing from 1946. Although it was based on the U.S. program, some changes were made. Even the U.S. slogan \\"dedicated to everyone who has ever been in love\\" was modified to \\"dedicated to all those who are in love, or can remember\\". A download of the first Australian episode is available on YouTube. Another U.S. program with an Australian version was Aunt Jenny. In Australia, Aunt Jenny was played by Ethel Lang. = From the U.K. to Australia = In the 1950s and 60s, 3DB broadcast a number of British dramas. These were mainly the product of the independent British production house, the Towers of London Syndicate, whose programs were produced for world-wide distribution, rather than in Britain. One of the most the most popular of these series was Secrets of Scotland Yard. = Other local dramas = As well as the Australian productions already mentioned, 3DB also broadcast a number of other Australian radio dramas, including a number by that prominent Australian radio drama producer, Grace Gibson Radio Productions. = Two important comedy serials = As well as drama, 3DB presented a number of radio comedies, two of the most notable being Fred and Maggie Everybody and Daddy and Paddy. Fred and Maggie starred Edward Howell and Therese Desmond. Daddy and Paddy featured Pat McLean and 3DB's stalwart broadcaster John Stuart. For many years, Stuart also conducted the breakfast session as Daybreak Dan and the children's session as Bob Breezy. = BBC comedies = In the early 1960s, amid much publicity, 3DB announced that it had made a deal with the British Broadcasting Corporation to broadcast a wide range of the popular BBC 30-minute comedy programs. Prior to this deal such programs had only been broadcast in Australia through the ABC or its predecessor companies. As part of the BBC/3DB deal, only programs that had already been heard on the ABC, could be replayed commercially.numerous issues of Listener-In, Radioprogram, Radio Times (Melbourne); ABC Weekly, in the collection of Albert Isaacs, Melbourne. = Music = Live music = 3DB staff who were musicians = There were a number of employees who were renowned for their presentation of live music. Chronologically, the first was violinist Agnes Brown. She joined 3DB in 1937 as Manager of the transcription department and remained on the staff until the 1960s. From the 1940s to the 60s, many 3DB programs were enhanced by 3DB's official piano accompanist Mabel Nelson. Charles Skase (father of Christopher Skase) was a 3DB announcer in the 1950s and 60s. He won the Melbourne Sun Aria in 1947. He sang in many 3DB programs, including (as already noted) C&G; Minstrels and The Happy Gang. = 3DB Symphony Orchestra = 3DB's commitment to classical music and light classical music was proven in 1949 when the 3DB Symphony Orchestra was formed, under manager Cedric Zahara. Verdon Williams conducted classical programs and William Flynn had the baton during lighter concerts, for which the orchestra used the shortened name, the 3DB Orchestra. It is believed that apart from the U.S.'s prestigious and long-standing NBC Symphony Orchestra, 3DB and Australia's Colgate-Palmolive Radio Network were the only commercial radio enterprises in the world to form symphony orchestras. Both Australian orchestras had comparatively short lives. = Feature programs = The 3DB building at 74 Flinders Street (1929-1966) included an auditorium with a public seating area, in the studio complex on the 1st floor. When the station was relocated to 61 Flinders Lane in 1966 (see above) an public auditorium was located off the foyer right near the main entrance to the building. However, because of competition to radio by television, live feature programs were becoming rarer and the auditorium at 61 Flinders Lane was certainly not used as much as the former one at 74 Flinders Street. The following programs renowned for their live music content have already been mentioned (above): The Test Cricket from England, The Happy Gang, The Minstrel Show, The Last of the Hillbillies and other Bob Dyer features. Amongst the many other live music programs featured on the station over the decades, the following are worthy of a special reference ... ... ...  Community Singing  Community Singing was popular on radio from the 1920s to the 1960s, with 3DB conducting many such programs over the years. These sessions were conducted in front of live audiences who joined in the singing of popular songs, often with the words displayed on large cards or on screens. The venues ranged from large Town Halls, including the Melbourne Town Hall, and the Tivoli Theatre, to the much smaller 3DB auditorium. Many of the earlier programs were compered by Charlie Vaude and Renn Millar. Later hosts included Dick Cranbourne, John Eden and Geoff McComas, with Mabel Nelson as accompanist. Community singing was normally broadcast at lunch-time on weekdays.  Music for the People  As well as his endeavours in the drama field, Hector Crawford was also interested in music and particularly orchestra conducting. In 1938 he produced the first Music for the People concert. These concerts were presented a number of times during each summer season on Sunday afternoons, firstly in the Fitzroy Gardens and from 1959 in the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. 3DB broadcast all Music for the People concerts from 1940. In latter years, the concerts were televised over HSV-7. The concerts were performed by an orchestra especially formed by Hector Crawford for the purpose, and known as the Australian Symphony Orchestra, and supplemented by a wide range of mainly well-known artistes. Originally, the concerts were composed of light classical music but, over the years, the format became lighter and lighter and even some pop music was later performed. A classic example of the latter occurred on 12 March 1967 when The Seekers performed at Music for the People; their performance being simulcast on 3DB and HSV 7. The Seekers concert was performed in front of the largest crowd ever for a concert event in Australia with an estimated 200,000 people attending.McFarlane, 'The Seekers' entry. Archived from the original on 4 June 2004. Retrieved 23 September 2011. The 2007 Guinness Book of World Records lists it as the greatest attendance at a concert in the Southern Hemisphere in history. This attendance is also included in The Australian Book of Records.  Mobil Quest  Mobil Quest was an important classical music talent quest produced by 3DB in the post-World War II era and relayed to over 50 stations across Australia. It discovered many musicians who went on to have prestigious careers, including the 1949 Mobil Quest winner Ronal Jackson. Dame Joan Sutherland was second-placed in 1949 and was the winner in 1950.  Australia's Amateur Hour and National Amateur Hour  A popular and more populist talent quest was Australia's Amateur Hour which commenced in 1940 and was produced and compered by Sydney people, but toured Australia performing in various large halls. It was originally broadcast nationally over the Macquarie Radio Network before transferring to the Major Broadcasting Network, of which 3DB was the Melbourne outlet. The first compere was Harry Dearth, who was followed by Dick Fair and then by Terry Dear. In 1956 the program was transferred back to the Macquarie network, (3AW in Melbourne). The Major network retaliated by broadcasting the National Amateur Hour at exactly the same time as its Macquarie rival. Dick Fair returned as compere of the National Amateur Hour. Both of these talent quests ceased in 1958, partly because their rivalry split the available audience, and partly because of competition from television.  Swallow's Parade  Swallows Parade was an Australian radio and television series. The radio version was broadcast by 3DB in the 1950s and 1960s, and was relayed on the Major Broadcasting Network. It was heard on a Thursday evening, with auditions being held on Tuesdays. It was sometimes presented in front of a live audience, and sometimes with just the compere and artists. It was usually broadcast from various towns and cities with Major Network outlets.various radio program guides in the collection of Albert Isaacs, Melbourne. Sometimes programmes would be compiled from various recording sessions. All artists were amateurs.  Swallow's Juniors  Swallow's Juniors was broadcast at 6.30 pm on a Saturday evening, from the 1950s and into the early 1960s.The Listener In TV, magazine, Melbourne, \\"May 21-May 27; 1960\\" edition It was also telecast from November 1957 to 1970 on HSV-7. There was a period of radio/TV simulcasting before it was exclusively telecast. It was a talent contest featuring young performers, and was initially hosted by 3DB breakfast announcer John Eden. However Brian Naylor soon took over as compere.  Coca-Cola Bottlers Club  In the late 1950s, Dick Cranbourne, assisted by 3DB's official piano accompanist Mabel Nelson, presented a children's session sponsored by Coca-Cola Bottlers (Melbourne) Pty. Ltd.,https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/items/2048777https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/items/1708623 and recorded at various suburban halls such as church halls, in front of an audience, mainly made-up of children. A full week's programming (4 sessions) was recorded in one sitting. The program mainly consisted of a junior talent quest, quizzes, etc. As well as the 3DB program, Coca-Cola also broadcast a similar program on 2UW Sydney.  Hillbilly Time  The last live music program to be heard on 3DB was Hillbilly Time, again hosted by Dick Cranbourne. It ran from the early 1950s to the early 1980s. In its final years it changed its name to Country and Western Hour. As both names suggest, the program featured live hillbilly music, also referred to as country and western music. It was amongst the last fully live programs on Melbourne commercial radio.  Recorded music = The 3DB record library = The BBC record library was the world's largest, at one stage containing 45,000 discs. Thanks to the work of Program Manager Stan Clark, in 1934 3DB had the world's second largest library. It has been estimated that, at that time, 3DB could have stayed on the air from daybreak to dawn for six months without repeating a record. = Experiments in improved sound = Until 1948 when standard long playing discs first became commercially available,Read, Oliver and Welch, Walter L.; From Tin Foil to Stereo; 1959; Howard Sams & Co Inc, Indianapolis, NY, USA most recordings broadcast were 78 rpm monaural discs with one horizontal sound wave on the disc. In the 1930s however, there were some experiments with a vertical sound wave cut straight down into the disc. At the time, the main advantage of this was seen as being the improved sound quality, but these experiments eventually led to the invention of stereophonic sound. In Melbourne, three radio stations signed contracts with producers of vertical discs that gave them exclusive rights to play their recordings, and these were usually broadcast in specially devoted programs. 3DB played Diamondpoint discs especially imported from London, 3KZ played hill and dale records, and 3AW had a contract to use Vitatone recordings. = Music formats 1950s-1970s = Most Australian radio stations increased their commitment to the teenage market and to pop music in the 1950s, by introducing disc jockeys. 3DB's first DJ was Ernie Sigley who actually commenced his career at 3DB in 1953 as a turntable operator (then usually referred to as record boys) - this was actually a few years before he was given an on-air position. Another early 3DB DJ was Rod McLennan. = Television simulcasts = HSV-7 was originally owned by the HWT, as was 3DB. After HSV opened on 4 November 1956, there were a few programs that were simulcast on HSV and 3DB; these included Consider Your Verdict (see above - \\"Crawford Productions\\"), Music for the People (see above - \\"Live Music\\") and Swallows Juniors (see above - \\"Swallows Juniors\\"). Another important program that was simulcast was Meet the Press which was originally compared by journalist Frederick Howard. At this same time, a number of 3DB quiz and variety programs featuring Bob and Dolly Dyer (see above - Bob Dyer) were, on account of Major Broadcasting Network connections, simulcast on Sydney TV station ATN-7 and through its then Melbourne affiliate GTV-9. = Talkback = 3DB was one of the first Melbourne radio stations to initiate talkback programs on 17 April 1967before this date, some stations, including 3AK in Melbourne, had illegally broadcast such programs. The federal legislation making talkback legal addressed the two main complaints resulting from the illegal experiments. A beep every few seconds was introduced so that callers knew they were on-air. Also, there was a seven second delay in getting calls to air, so as to give time to get rid of any rude or defamatory content with Barry Jones conducting the first such program. Other early talkback hosts included Doug Aiton, Gerald Lyons and Michael Schildberger. As from April 1967, the 3DB talkback line-up included a number of specialist programs, namely Talk It Over a program with Pat Jarrett, Women's Editor of The Sun; Tradio a buy, swap and sell session with John Anderson; Dial for Dollars David Johnston's phone quiz; and Sports Forum with Ron Casey. = 1975, major change of direction = In 1975 Fred Flowers, Director of Broadcasting at 3DB, announced \\"the most radical changes in our history\\". He introduced a new slogan DB MUSIC. He went on to say that the station would have: \\"an exciting new sound with a blend of Top 40, flashbacks, and popular album tracks ... we aim to please the 18 to 39 age group. In fact, to attract listeners of any age who have a youthful lifestyle\\". Because of a contract with the Totalisator Agency Board, 3DB continued to broadcast horse races. Doug Aiton's morning talkback program also continued to be heard. In August 1980, the station was yet again rebranded as 100 3DB with a new disco-style jingle, \\"Rhythm of the City\\", produced by TM Studios. The jingle was also used (with localised variations) by radio stations throughout Australia that had a similar Top 40 format at the time, including 2UE in Sydney, 6PM in Perth, and 5AD in Adelaide. An extended length version of \\"Rhythm of the City\\" was later released as a single, inclusive of local branding edits depending on release location. The 3DB version of the single reached number 91 on the Australian Kent Music Report charts in October that year. = 3DB - The New Beginning = In mid-1986, Bert Newton was appointed general manager of 3DB, which he relaunched as a talkback station, while retaining its horse racing coverage (see above). Many high-profile personalities including Bert Newton himself who was the breakfast session host during this era. A new slogan was used by the station - 3DB - The New Beginning. = 3DB, the new ending = After purchasing the Geelong Advertiser and its subsidiary 3GL in 1987, the Herald and Weekly Times owned more than one station in the Melbourne/Geelong region, and thus was required by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to divest itself of one station. 3DB was sold and actually had four owners for short periods in the 12 months of 1987, including Kerry Stokes and Frank Lowy. J Albert and Son, a Sydney-based music company and owners of 2UW, purchased 3DB in late 1987 and changed the call sign to 3TT. The last program to be broadcast under the 3DB call sign, in the very early hours of 2 April 1988, was a repeat of Bert Newton's five-hour documentary on the 60th anniversary of 3DB, first broadcast in February 1987 to coincide with the 60th anniversary. 3TT was launched at 5.00 am on 2 April 1988. The major reason cited for the change of name was the fact that 3DB had recently broadcast under the slogan 3DB - The New Beginning and it was felt that that would have made it difficult to dramatically change the format whilst retaining the 3DB name. However, the new owners had actually considered a few other new call-signs, particularly names which included the same initial being repeated twice, such as 3BB or 3MM. Lawrence Costin who had been on the 3DB announcing staff for over 30 years was the only 3DB on-air personality to be retained by 3TT, as a newsreader and reporter. Personalities The following list is based, in the main, on names mentioned in a history of 3DB published in 1985. Some names appear under more than one sub-heading.

The asteroid was discovered by Pan-STARRS in December 2017, after it already had approached Earth at or 20 lunar distances (LD) on 6 November 2017. On 26 April 2057, it will pass Earth at a similar distance of 21 LD again.  Discovery and observations  was discovered by Pan-STARRS at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, on 10 December 2017, when the asteroid was about from Earth and had a solar elongation of 125¬∞. On 20 January 2018 with a 40-day observation arc, it reached Torino scale 1 with an estimated 1 in 3000 chance of impacting Earth on 28 April 2057. The nominal JPL Horizons 28 April 2057 Earth distance was estimated at with a 3-sigma uncertainty of ¬±52 million km. NEODyS listed the nominal 28 April 2057 Earth distance at . A Monte Carlo simulation using Solex 12 with 1000 clones of the asteroid generated one impactor. On 27 January 2018 Pan- STARRS precovery images from November and December 2011 were announced, and was removed from the Sentry Risk Table. These precovery images extended the observation arc from 40 days to 6.21 years. It is now known that on 26 April 2057 the asteroid will be just past closest approach roughly from Earth with a 3-sigma uncertainty of ¬±3000 km. The asteroid was last observed on 20 January 2018 at apparent magnitude 24 by T14 Mauna Kea. As the asteroid is becoming very faint, further observations during this approach are difficult. The next good chance to recover the asteroid will be between March and late April 2022 when the asteroid will pass about from Earth.  Orbit and classification  is an Apollo asteroid, the largest group of near-Earth objects and Earth- crossing asteroids with approximately 10 thousand known members. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.72‚Äì1.55 AU once every 15 months (440 days; semi-major axis of 1.13 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.36 and an inclination of 15¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid has a notably low minimum orbital intersection distance with Earth of , or 0.11 LD.  Physical characteristics  On the Sentry Risk Table, the object had an estimated mean- diameter of . Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, measures between 100 and 200 meters in diameter, for an absolute magnitude of 22.4, and an assumed albedo between 0.05 and 0.20, which represent typical values for carbonaceous and stony asteroids, respectively. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of this object has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.

Background The President of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated in the 15 August 1975 Bangladesh coup d'√©tat by disgruntled Bangladesh Army officers led by Major Syed Faruque Rahman. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led Bangladesh through the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation war. He was the founding President of Bangladesh and leader of the Mujibnagar government (the Bangladeshi government in exile).

After the Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman he, with the support of the army officers involved in the coup, declared himself the President of Bangladesh. Brigadier General Khaled Mosharraf was a Bengali officer in the Pakistan Army. He joined the Mukti Bahini after the start of Bangladesh Liberation war. He was a sector commander. He was appointed by the Mujibnagar government to lead Sector 2 of the Mukti Bahini. He survived a bullet wound to his head during the war and was provided treatment in Lucknow, India. After Bangladesh became an independent country, he was awarded Bir Uttam by the government of Bangladesh for his role in the war. In 1975, he was serving as the Chief of general staff of Bangladesh army. Events After the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the assassins had established their government based in Bangabhaban (the Presidential Palace) under Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad. On 3 November 1975, Brigadier General Khaled Mosharraf launched a coup to remove the assassins from power and Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad from the Presidency. Khaled Mosharraf was being supported by Colonel Shafaat Jamil, the brigade commander of 46th Independent Infantry Brigade based in Dhaka. They were worried about Army discipline with junior mutinous officers issuing orders from the Presidential palace. Khaled Mosharraf and the Army Chief, Ziaur Rahman, disagreed on when to remove the rebels from power. Khaled wanted it to be done as soon as possible while Zia wanted to wait till heavy armours are removed from the Presidential Palace. He used helicopters of Bangladesh Air Force to scare the rebels held up in the Presidential Palace. As it appeared a military confrontation was imminent, Muhammad Ghulam Tawab, the chief of the Air Force was able convince the rebels to negotiate their way out of power and the Presidential palace. Muhammad Ghulam Tawab was appointed to his position by the rebels after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The rebels agreed on the conditions that they be provided safe passage to Thailand. On 3 November 1975, before the rebels went on exile, they killed four Bangladesh Awami League leaders in jail. The four leaders were Syed Nazrul Islam, former Vice President and acting President of Bangladesh, Tajuddin Ahmad, former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Muhammad Mansur Ali, former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, and Abul Hasnat Muhammad Qamaruzzaman, former Home Minister of Bangladesh. Khaled Mosharraf ordered the arrests of K.M. Obaidur Rahman, Nurul Islam Manzur, Shah Moazzam Hossain, and Taheruddin Thakur, they were Bangladesh Awami League politicians who had aligned themselves with Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad. On 4 November 1975, Khaled was to promoted to Major General and made the Chief of Army Staff. Ziaur Rahman was retired from service and placed under house arrest in Dhaka Cantonment. Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, the chief Justice of Bangladesh, was made president and replaced Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad. Major General Khaled Mosharraf was killed in the 7 November 1975 Bangladesh coup d'√©tat led by Colonel Abu Taher with the support of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. Colonel Najmul Huda and Lieutenant Colonel Abu Taher Mohammad Haider were also killed in the coup. The officers were visiting the 10th East Bengal Regiment when they were killed by the soldiers of the regiment. The Coup also freed and reinstated General Ziaur Rahman.

History  Gr√§fenthal was first mentioned in 1288. It came to the counts of Weimar-Orlam√ºnde, and later formed the nexus of a minor state. Debts accrued by the Gr√§fenthal line forced them to approach the wealthy House of Wettin for sale in 1394, finally selling all rights to the territory to the Electorate of Saxony in 1426. In 1438 the Electors sold the territory to the Pappenheims, though they retained the sovereign rights over the territory. In 1444 the heirs of Haupt II, Marshall of Pappenheim partitioned the family's holdings between themselves. Gr√§fenthal passed to Conrad III, Haupt's second son, along with half of Schweinspoint and Spielberg. The core hereditary lands of the family were ruled jointly by all branches, and the office of the Imperial Marshal of the Holy Roman Empire was held by the family's most senior agnate. In 1465 he inherited the Imperial Lordship of Breitenegg through his wife, but he sold that territory to Wildenstein in 1473. Conrad III was succeeded by his grandson Sebastian in 1482, enfeoffed with Gr√§fenthal by the Elector in 1483. Sebastian fostered a close relationship with the Saxons, accompanying them to the Imperial Diet in 1487. In 1530 he adopted the teachings of Martin Luther. In 1547 Gr√§fenthal hosted the Emperor Charles V and the Duke of Alba. The family died out with Christopher Ulrich in 1599. Gr√§fenthal was divided between the Gr√∂nenbach and St√ºhlingen lines, and it all came to the St√ºhlingen line with the extinction of the Gr√∂nenbachs in 1619. In debt, Gr√§fenthal was in turn sold to Saxe- Altenburg in 1621.

The first campaign against Chiefdom of Chuchen (Da Jinchuan or Greater Jinchuan) happened in 1747 when the Tusi of Greater Jinchuan Slob Dpon attacked Mingzheng Tusi. The Qianlong Emperor decided to mobilize forces and suppress Slob Dpon, who surrendered to the central government in 1749. The second campaign against Chiefdom of Tsanlha (Xiao Jinchuan or Lesser Jinchuan) took place in 1771, when the Jinchuan Tusi Sonom killed Gebushiza Tusi of Ngawa County in Sichuan Province. After Sonom killed Gebushiza Tusi, he helped Tusi of Lesser Jinchuan, Senge Sang, to occupy the lands belonging to the other Tusi in the region. The provincial government ordered Sonom to return lands and accept the trial at the Ministry of Justice immediately. Sonom refused to retreat his rebels. Qianlong was furious and gathered 80,000 troops and entered Jinchuan. In 1776, Qing troops sieged the castle of Sonom to force his surrender. The Jinchuan campaigns were two of the Ten Great Campaigns of Qianlong. Compare to his other eight campaigns, the cost of fighting Jinchuan was extraordinary. Jinchuan, a small county of Sichuan, cost the Qing Empire 50,000 people and 70 million silver taels to conquer, a cost that was more devastating than any other Great Campaigns accomplished by Qianlong. Alt URL  Background = The History of Jinchuan = The name Jinchuan (Chinese: ÈáëÂ∑ù; Tibetan: ‡ΩÜ‡Ω¥‡ºã‡ΩÜ‡Ω∫‡Ωì‡ºã) means \\"Golden Stream\\" in Chinese and \\"Big River\\" in Tibetan. The name refers to two rivers in Northwest Sichuan, the Greater Jinchuan and the Lesser Jinchuan, both of which are tributaries of Dadu River. The literary meaning of the name in Chinese stems from ancient tales which described a giant gold mine between Greater Jinchuan and Lesser Jinchuan. The majority people who lived in Jinchuan were rGyalrong People, who were ruled under the name of Buddha by hereditary Tusi. = The History of Tusi = The Gyalrong people (Chinese: ÂòâÁªí‰∫∫; Tibetan: ‡Ω¢‡æí‡æ±‡Ω£‡ºã‡Ω¢‡Ωº‡ΩÑ‡ºã; Wylie: rgyal rong) is a branch of Tibetan descendants who live in the Northwest Sichuan, China. They speak rGyalrong languages and practice Tibetan Buddhism. The Ming dynasty set up the Tusi system in Sichuan and Tibet to stabilize cultural conflicts between Confucian central government and Buddhist tribes. Tusi was the prime leader of his designated tribe, of which there were eighteen in Sichuan. Tusi ruled the rGyalrong tribes for decades as a puppet ruler of the government. By the end of the Ming dynasty, the Tusi system was unable to adapt to the rapid changes of society. Tusi promoted the slavery system in Jinchuan, and they had the rights of a chieftain in their tribes. There were minor armed conflicts between the eighteen Tusi. Some of those conflicts evolved into armed rebellions. Officials of Qing realized that the Tusi system was a problem after they took over China from Ming. The viceroy of Yun-Gui Ortai suggested Yongzheng emperor to start the Bureaucratization of Tusi in Sichuan to replace the Tusi system, then retake the land and people for the empire. In 1726, the emperor had Ortai supervise the bureaucratization. The reform was successful in Guizhou and Yunnan. But it saw resistance in Sichuan when the Tusi started a major rebellion.  The Two Campaigns = First Campaign Against Jinchuan = leftSlob Dpon was the Tusi of Greater Jinchuan. He was trying to unite tribes in Sichuan to fight the bureaucratization of Tusi. He kidnapped the Tusi of Lesser Jinchuan Zewang in 1746 to force an alliance between Greater Jinchuan and minor Jinchuan. People in Lesser Jichuan were not satisfied with Slob Dpon. They sent a messenger to Chengdu to notify the Sichuan governor Ji Shan. Slob Dpon heard about this, one might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. In 1747, Slob Dpon ordered an assault against Mingzheng Tusi's tribe. Ji Shan sent a few garrisons to attack Slob Dpon. The garrisons were defeated quickly and unexpectedly. Ji Shan realized the emergence of this sudden event and Slob Dpon's ambitions. He reported the rebellion and asked for help from the imperial court. The Grand Council was angered by Slob Dpon's action. Qianlong mobilized 30,000 troops to suppress Slob Dpon's tribe. He appointed Zhang Guangsi as the overall commander to capture Greater Jinchuan. The corrupt Qing army failed to defeat Slob Dpon's untrained tribe warriors under highland climate. One year later, Qianlong ordered one of his Grand Secretariats Necin to reinforce Zhang's army with more than 40,000 soldiers. Slob Dpon fortified the mountains and waterways, and the rGyalrongs were more familiar with the landscape. Necin didn't cooperate well with Zhang due to court politics. Besides, Necin never had experience in commanding armed forces before. Slob Dpon placed a spy near in Qing's high command. Zhang did not find out about it. Greater Jinchuan was prepared for all its opponents military actions. Qing army was defeated again in April 1748. Qianlong executed Zhang in December under the charge of disadvantageous commanding Heaven's army. Necin committed suicide for shaming the emperor's name. Fuheng became the commander in 1749. He was an experienced general. He slowed the attack and killed all the spies in the army. Fuheng separated the army to attack Slop Dpon from different directions. Qing army finally broke the walls of Slob Dpon's stronghold in 1749. Slob Dpon surrendered, and he agreed to pay as tribute thousands of silver taels and many golden Buddha statues to save his life. Qianlong emperor trusted him and kept him as the Tusi, and paused the bureaucratization in Sichuan province. The First Campaign Against Jinchuan was considered one of Qianlong's Great Achievements. Ironically, it was extremely unsuccessful for the following reasons: # The Qing government mobilized more than 80,000 men in total from seven provinces to fight against a tribe that was not equipped with cannons nor firearms. # Qianlong did not execute Slob Dpon, which made other Tusi more fearful of Greater Jinchuan's force. # The central government did not take any step to limit Tusi's army size, which gave them opportunities to rebel again. = Second Campaign Against Jinchuan = Agui's portrait Slob Dpon died in 1760. His nephew Lang Kashi inherited the throne as the new Tusi of Greater Jinchuan. Lang Kashi wanted to fulfill his uncle's legacy and wishes of becoming the new Tibetan King. He united some Tusi, recruited warriors, built defenses and implemented anti-Qing education in Jinchuan. After Lang Kashi passed away a few years later, his son Sonom took the Tusi's name. Senge Sang was a friend of Sonom, they dropped the family hatred and formed a military alliance. Sonom launched a sudden strike against Gebushiza Tusi in 1771. Senge Sang attacked other Tusi. Qianlong announced a second campaign against Jinchuan. This time Qianlong was determined to end the Tusi system in Sichuan. The governor of Sichuan Artai led 20,000 troops to attack Senge Sang. The conquest made no progress in six months. Qianlong dismissed him as the governor. Later on, Wenfu the Grand Secretariat was appointed as the overall commander. Guilin became the governor of Sichuan and the vice overall commander. Wenfu led the west front to attack Lesser Jinchuan, and Guilin struck from the south. Wenfu was unstoppable, but Guilin's general Xue Zong was surrounded by the enemy at Heilong Valley in Kangding. 30,000 troops were killed. Guilin did not reinforce Xue Zong's army and then was executed by Qianlong. The emperor needed a general to secure the victory, so he appointed the \\"Iron General\\" who just returned from conquering Burma, Agui, as the overall commander.200x200pxAgui was a smart and brave general. In November of 1772, Agui realized that Senge Sang's command post was located in Meidu Lama Temple, north of the Lesser Jinchuan Stream. He took 4,000 soldiers with him and crossed the stream under the moonlight. They captured the temple, but Senge Sang escaped to Greater Jinchuan. Agui sent a message to Sonom promising that if he handed over Senge Sang, the Qing army would retreat and admit his role as the Tibet King. Sonom refused his request. Wenfu and Agui joined forces in Lesser Jinchuan in 1773. They stationed the army near Meidu and were waiting for spring to launch the second wave of offense. Unexpectedly, Greater Jinchuan gathered elite forces and struck during a snow storm. They occupied the military granary of the Qing army. Wenfu's force fought without supplies, and Wenfu was killed during the battle. Agui retreated, and Gyalrongs retook the Lesser Jinchuan. Qianlong was surprised by how long this campaign went on. He ordered an immediate reinforcement with stockpiles of firearms and imported heavy cannons for Agui's army. Qianlong wanted to end the war at any cost. Agui executed the high orders. The Qing army started to massacre Gyalrong people to cut the army resource of Jinchuan. Agui conquered many fortresses, then reached Geer Cliff, Sonom's stronghold, in 1775. Agui started a siege and cut off the water supply of Geer Cliff. Sonom accepted Agui's terms of surrender. He poisoned Senge Sang and sent his corpse to Agui. Agui refused to accept the surrender because Qianlong did not want to see a third campaign against Jinchuan. In 1775, Agui commanded an assault. The Qing army occupied the outskirts of Geer Cliff. Sonom retreated into the fort. In 1776, the Qing army launched its final attack on Geer Cliff with cannons. Sonom gave up the hopeless resistance. The Second Campaign against Jinchuan had ended.  Aftermath = Results = The Qing's decisive victory against Jinchuan rebel Tusi was documented by historical records. Qianlong was very happy about the fact that Jinchuan was defeated by his Army of Heaven. Later on, the Bureaucratization of Tusi proceeded in this region. The tribal administration was abolished, while Tusi were exiled or executed. The central government established states and counties in Sichuan, solidified control over the minorities and increased cultural exchange between Zhongyuan (Chinese: ‰∏≠Âéü) and border areas. This led to the foundation of Han domination in Southwest China. It ended the slavery societies in Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan. The campaigns against Jinchuan symbolized the absolute power of the Qing central government while confirming the centralization of the empire's territory and administration. Aba County today = Significance = Among Qianlong's Ten Great Campaigns. The war against Dzungar costed 23 million silver taels, and expanded the territory of the Qing by over 1,500,000 km2. The Campaign in Burma made Burma a tributary state and only 70,000 troops fought in the war. But the Qing gained nothing from the Two Campaigns against Jinchuan. 180% of the nation's annual revenue was spent and 600,000 troops fought in a 40,000 km2 region for over 9 years. The second campaign could have been avoided by abolishing the Tusi system in 1749. Compared to the total cost of 130 million silver taels of Qianlong's Ten Great Campaigns, the tremendous relative cost of the Jinchuan campaigns accelerated the economic crisis of the Qing dynasty. This economic crisis would ultimately indirectly lead to the fall of the empire. However, the campaigns unified China proper and improved the stature of the imperial court and its policies.

She was hired in 1976 by American Airlines as their third female pilot. In 1986, Bass became the first female captain of a commercial plane at American Airlines and later that year she captained the first all-female crew in the history of commercial jet aviation, on an American Airlines flight from Washington D.C. to Dallas, Texas. She and pilot Stephanie Wallach founded the International Society of Women Airline Pilots, which began as a group of women aviators but later changed into a program providing career support and mentorship to aspiring pilots. Early life Bass was born and raised in Fort Myers, Florida and graduated from high school in 1970. She studied Spanish and Interior Design at Texas Christian University, receiving a bachelor's degree in both subjects in May 1974. Bass cites her aunt, who would park her Volkswagen Beetle by the local airport's chain-link fence so Bass could watch planes takeoff and land, as her inspiration to start flying. Bass' father, fearing losing Bass' interest in the family's quarter horses, refused flying lessons. Bass started flying the summer after her first year at Texas Christian University, in 1971. She logged her hours at Fort Worth's Meacham airport, spending 6 hours there each afternoon-3-9PM. Bass' first professional experience came when a local mortician needed to fly a young woman's body to Arkansas. Bass' career in commercial aviation began with difficulty, Bass said: \\"I was told there couldn't be a female pilot flying executives around because what would the wives think\\". Bass began flying for American Airlines in 1976 at age 24. Diversion to Gander on September 11, 2001 Bass was piloting a Boeing 777 en route from Charles de Gaulle Airport to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport when the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, occurred. Due to the closure of American airspace, Bass‚Äôs flight was ordered to land at Gander International Airport in Gander, Newfoundland, as part of the Canadian government's Operation Yellow Ribbon. Her experience in Gander during the days following the attacks was one of several people's stories featured in the Tony Award-winning Canadian musical Come from Away. While the Beverley Bass character in the musical is partly a composite character combining experiences of other pilots in Gander at the time, the number \\"Me and the Sky\\" is entirely drawn from the real Bass's life story. Bass has developed a close friendship with Jenn Colella, the actress who portrays her in the Broadway company of Come from Away, and frequently travels to see the show. Honors In 2019 she was made Brian Kelly's TPG Awards honoree, and it was announced that his company had donated $50,000 to the International Society of Women Airline Pilots in Bass' honor.

They were 10 and 12 years old at the time. She had filed for divorce and an emergency order of protection, but was killed before receiving a response. The Lutgens got into a fight after Ms. Lutgen refused to allow the children to go out shopping with their father. James Lutgen testified that his wife had attempted to strangle him, and that he had then choked her until she died. Lutgen plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter and received a 4-year prison sentence, of which he served 13 months. Lutgen was released in 1986 and allowed to retain custody of his children. A circuit court judge in Jo Daviess County ruled that Lurgen was \\"a fit and proper person to have the care and control of his minor children. The aunt and uncle of the two young girls appealed the judicial order that returned custody of the children to their father, but a three panel appeals court said there was no precedent or law to overturn the lower court's decision: > Neither our Legislature nor our case law in Illinois has seen fit to set > forth a rule that the killing of one parent by the other in the presence of > the children, no matter what the circumstances, is sufficient to deprive > that parent of his or her children on the basis of unfitness. A witness testified that she had seen the children and Ms. Lutgen with injuries, including a black eye, but had not personally seen how the children received the injuries. Although a state statute mandated that the court consider domestic violence as a factor to determine the best interests of the child, the court said that the statute did not require that domestic violence be given more weight than any other factor.

Austria contributes to one of the magnetometers. The first CSES Satellite was launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert (Inner Mongolia) on February 2, 2018. The expected mission lifetime is of 5 years. Overview The mission aims to study the existence of possible (temporal and spatial) correlations between the observation of iono- magnetospheric perturbations as well as precipitation of particles from the inner Van Allen belts and the occurrence of seismic events. However, a careful analysis is needed in order to distinguish measurements possibly associated to earthquakes from the large background generated in the geomagnetic cavity by the solar activity and the tropospheric electromagnetic emissions. CSES mission will investigate the structure and the dynamics of the topside ionosphere, the coupling mechanisms between upper atmosphere, ionosphere and magnetosphere and the temporal variations of the geomagnetic field, in quiet and disturbed conditions. Data collected by the mission will also allow to studying solar-terrestrial interactions and phenomena of solar physics, namely Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), solar flares and cosmic ray solar modulation. The mission will contribute to develop an observational sharing service for the international cooperation and the scientific community. The mission is part of a collaboration program between the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI).

The Limadou Collaboration includes the INFN Divisions of Bologna, Naples, Perugia, Roma Tor Vergata, the INFN Center TIFPA of Trento, the INFN National Laboratories of Frascati, the Universities of Bologna, Trento, Roma Tor Vergata, Uninettuno and the Institutes INAF-IAPS (Italian National Institute of Astrophysics and Planetology) and INGV (Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology). The LIMADOU Collaboration has designed, built and tested the High Energy Particle Detector (HEPD) of the CSES mission, conceived for optimizing detection of energetic charged particles precipitating from the inner Van Allen belts (as a result of seismic and non-seismic electromagnetic perturbations); it has collaborated in developing and testing the Electronic Field Detector (EFD) in the INAF-IAPS plasma chamber in Rome, and it participates in the data analysis of all payloads of the CSES mission.  Satellite and instruments  CSES Satellite. Payload Locations (the Tri-Band Beacon is hidden behind the satellite). CSES is a 3-axes stabilized satellite, based on the Chinese CAST2000 platform, with a mass of about 730 kg and a peak of power consumption of about 900 W. Scientific data will be transmitted in X-band at 120 Mbit/s. The orbit is circular Sun-synchronous, at an altitude of about 500 km, an inclination of about 98¬∞, and descending node at 14:00 LT. The CSES payload includes: two particle detectors (the High-Energy Particle Detectors (HEPD) and the High-Energy Particle Package (HEPP)) to measure flux, energy spectrum, type and direction of impinging particles; a Search-Coil Magnetometer (SCM) and a High Precision Magnetometer (HPM) to measure the components and the total intensity of the magnetic field, respectively; a four probes Electric Field Detector (EFD) to measure the electric field components in a wide frequencies range; a Plasma analyzer Package (PAP) and a Langmuir probe (LP) to measure plasma parameters; a GNSS Occultation Receiver and a Tri-Band Beacon to measure the density of electrons and to perform ionospheric tomography The High Precision Magnetometer (HPM) is developed in cooperation between the National Space Science Center (NSSC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Space Research Institute (IWF) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (√ñAW) and the Institute of Experimental Physics (IEP) of the Graz University of Technology. NSSC is responsible for the dual sensor fluxgate magnetometer, the instrument processor and the power supply unit, while IWF and IEP participate with a scalar magnetometer (CDSM).http://www.iwf.oeaw.ac.at/en/missions/future-missions/cses/ Each instrument will collect data in two operating modes: ‚Äò‚Äòburst mode‚Äô‚Äô, activated when the satellite passes over China and the more seismic regions of the Earth, and ‚Äò‚Äòsurvey mode‚Äù for other areas of the Planet. There are two different orbital working zones: the ‚Äò‚Äòpayload operating zone‚Äô‚Äô, for geomagnetic latitudes between -65¬∞ and +65¬∞ (where the instruments will collect data) and the ‚Äò‚Äòplatform adjustment zone‚Äô‚Äô, at higher latitudes (where all detectors will be switched off to perform the satellite attitude control and the orbital maintenance activities).

He is known for his work on the air at CBS News, London correspondent for ABC News, documentary work for PBS and CBS, and his book and magazine writing. He won the George Polk Memorial Award of the Overseas Press Club of America for \\"best reporting in any medium requiring exceptional courage and enterprise abroad\\" for his coverage of the Vietnam War in 1970. Life and career Laurence attended Fairfield College Preparatory School and then Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania. While at the University of Pennsylvania, he started working at the campus radio station, WXPN which led to his career in broadcast journalism. He worked at WWDC (AM/FM) in Washington D.C. for a year and then at WNEW-AM/FM in New York from 1962‚Äì64. He joined CBS News as a radio correspondent in January, 1965. He covered the U.S. intervention in the Dominican Civil War in April‚ÄìMay 1965 where he produced a radio documentary on the revolution. =Vietnam War= Laurence volunteered to go to South Vietnam in August 1965 as a radio reporter while Morley Safer, Charles Collingwood, Peter Kalischer and others did television. However, as an extra camera crew was available, he started reporting for TV, beginning with an exclusive report on the arrival of the 1st Cavalry Division's advance party in South Vietnam. He covered Operation Piranha, the Battle of An Ninh, the Siege of Plei Me, the aftermath of the Battle of Ia Drang and Operation Masher. In December, 1965, Laurence was promoted from reporter to correspondent by Fred W. Friendly, the president of CBS News. This made him the youngest correspondent in CBS News history. He was 26 years old. Laurence was initially supportive of U.S. policy in Vietnam and gave favorable if neutral coverage in what was referred to by the U.S. Army public information officers as \\"being with the program\\". However, as he saw more and more of the war, witnessing the deaths of American GIs and Vietnamese civilians, the accidental bombing of a village in neutral Cambodia, coming under fire from friendly forces, and seeing the corruption endemic in South Vietnam, he became more critical of the U.S. presence and what might actually be achieved there. Through his friendship with UPI photojournalist Steve Northup, Laurence became a regular visitor at 47 Bui Thi Xuan, Saigon, the home of Northup and fellow correspondents Tim Page, Martin Stuart-Fox, David Stuart-Fox, Simon Dring, Joseph Galloway, and later Sean Flynn. It was known as \\"Frankie's House\\" after the resident Vietnamese houseboy. Frankie's House became a social club for a small group of young correspondents and their friends who talked, listened to music and smoked marijuana between field assignments. Laurence gifted Page a sandalwood box in which he kept a ready supply of marijuana. On 10 March 1966, following the Battle of A Sau, Laurence interviewed Marine Lt. Col. Charles House, commander of HMM-163, the unit which had evacuated the survivors of the battle and who had himself been shot down and rescued from the battlefield. House stated that panicking CIDG troops had overloaded the evacuation helicopters. The crews and Special Forces troops opened fire on them to restore order. The story caused outrage when broadcast and led to an investigation by Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) and III MAF but no further action was taken. On 22 May 1966, Laurence's friend and Frankie's House regular, Sam Castan, a LOOK magazine correspondent, was killed at Landing Zone Hereford and Laurence wrote Castan's obituary for LOOK. Laurence left Vietnam in late May, 1966, returning to the U.S. and working out of CBS bureaus in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta. He covered racial/police violence in Cleveland, Ohio in 1966, the civil rights movement in the South and other domestic stories in the United States. Laurence returned to Vietnam in August 1967. He covered the Battle of Dak To, the Tet Offensive, the siege of Con Thien, the Battle of Khe Sanh, the Battle of Hue, corruption among the Vietnamese, and the plight of South Vietnamese civilians among other combat stories. With cameraman Keith Kay, they were the first TV crew to report on the siege of Con Thien in September, 1967 and Kay and Laurence received a cable from Walter Cronkite congratulating them on their work. In February 1968 Laurence and Kay were the first TV team to reach Hue on the third day of the battle and first to get their film on the air in the U.S. Laurence later had dinner with Walter Cronkite the night before the CBS anchorman returned to the U.S. following his two week tour of Vietnam to study the aftermath of the Tet Offensive. He tried to impress on Cronkite his belief that the war had reached a stalemate and that America was wasting the lives of its own troops and those of the Vietnamese people by continuing the war. Soon after, Cronkite broadcast a special report on CBS calling for negotiations to end the war.Brinkley, Douglas (2012) Cronkite. Harper/Harper/Collins (New York) Laurence reported the 1968 documentary \\"Hill 943,\\" an hour-long special report on CBS News, recounting the lives (and death) of Company A, 3rd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment trying to capture Hill 943 during the Battle of Dak To. \\"The grim and unpublicized routine of the war in Vietnam‚Äîthe dangerous assignment of an American company to penetrate the jungle and take Hill 943‚Äîwas related with unusual intimacy in last night's news special of the Columbia Broadcasting System,\\" New York Times TV reviewer Jack Gould wrote. Laurence's second tour in Vietnam ended in May 1968. Based in New York, he covered racial violence in Chicago, Detroit, Newark, Kansas City and San Francisco. Sigma Delta Chi, the U.S. professional journalism society, made its television reporting award for Distinguished Service in Journalism to Laurence for his coverage of the Vietnam war in 1967. Laurence received an Emmy Award from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for his 1968 series of investigative reports called \\"Police After Chicago\\" on the CBS Evening News. In 1969, Laurence reported an hour documentary on what had become known in the United States as the \\"Generation gap,\\" the difference in attitudes between young people and their parents. \\"People are so much more interesting than statistics, a fact demonstrated once again last night on the Columbia Broadcasting System's superb television study of the generation gap, \\"Fathers and Sons\\" wrote George Gent in the New York Times. In March, 1970, Laurence returned to Vietnam to produce and report a documentary that would later become The World of Charlie Company. Along with his cameraman, Keith Kay, and sound technician James Clevenger, they spent four months recording the daily lives and experiences of Company C, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, in T√¢y Ninh Province in War Zone C near the Cambodian border. They lived, ate and marched with them, while sending reports for the CBS Evening News. In April 1970, Laurence and his team accompanied C Company as they conducted a helicopter assault into Memot District at the start of the Cambodian Campaign attempting to engage the North Vietnamese military headquarters known as COSVN. For his work, Laurence received a Columbia duPont Silver Baton award. =1970-2006= In 1970, Laurence moved to London to take over as bureau chief from Morley Safer. He and Keith Kay covered the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 from East Pakistan. As a London-based correspondent, he covered the conflict in Northern Ireland for the next 20 years. He covered the October War (Yom Kippur War) between Syria, Egypt and Israel in 1973. In 1974, he covered the wars in Cyprus, Rhodesia and Ethiopia and the continuing artillery, air force and terrorist incidents between Syria, Lebanon and Israel. Other wars and revolutions he covered in the 1970s, 80s and 90s included Portugal, Angola, Lebanon, Iceland, Afghanistan, South Africa and Yugoslavia. He covered the first Gulf War in 1990-91 and reported from Kuwait for a month after the war for ABC News Nightline. In 2003, Laurence accompanied a rifle company from the 101st Air Assault Division into Iraq at the start of the Iraq War. He returned to Iraq with the same rifle company to make a documentary and was embedded with it for 16 months in 2005-06. The film was called, \\"I Am an American Soldier.\\"IMDB.com/I Am an American Soldier In 1977, Laurence left CBS News and began working on his book, \\"The Cat from Hue: a Vietnam War Story.\\" In 1978, he joined ABC News as a London correspondent at a time when its new president, Roone Arledge, was building the TV news division to make it more competitive with CBS and NBC. In July 1982 Laurence returned briefly to Vietnam for the first time since 1970. Laurence's memoir of his years covering the war in Vietnam, \\"The Cat from Hue: a Vietnam War Story,\\" was published in 2002 by PublicAffairs Press in New York. It received positive reviews in The New York Times and in other major U.S. newspapers and magazines. The book received the Cornelius Ryan Award from the Overseas Press Club, its sole annual book award, for \\"Best Non-Fiction Reporting on International Affairs\\". The documentary film Laurence produced and directed, \\"I Am an American Soldier\\" was shown at film festivals in New York, Orlando and Traverse City, Michigan in 2007. It received a Founder's Award at Traverse City given by Michael Moore, and a Certificate of Appreciation from the 10th Mountain Division at its base in Louisiana for a screening of the film for troops about to embark for a year in Iraq.

Solberg is recognized for her multi-disciplinary and multi-dimensional art featuring paintings and installations. She has exhibited internationally with both solo and group shows.  Early life and education  Growing up, Solberg was a competitive gymnast and in college took up slopestyle skiing. She subsequently competed as a professional on the national circuit for two years. Solberg studied art at the Art Institute of Chicago as part of its Summer Studies program in 2001 and received her BFA at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2005.  Artistic style  Solberg has been praised by art critics for her large-scale abstract expressionist works and conceptual installations. She produces large-scale paintings, installations and immersive experiences with the aim to evoke emotions. As part of her work, she utilizes readily available materials such as rocks, wood, used drop clothes, tarpaulin, and styrofoam.  Work  As part of Solberg's Stalker solo show, she debuted four-foot-by-eight-foot silver rectangles covered in etchings at THIS Gallery. The series was inspired by Rudolf Stingel's 2007 installation at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 2013, Solberg debuted 24HR PSYCHIC, a \\"ghost gallery\\" seeking to create a platform for discussion and awareness of self. It was open from December 2013 through February 2014 in LA's Arts District. This initial show was an immersive fishbowl experience where visitors could walk in 24-7 to reflect. Since then, the gallery has moved online and has been described by author Jenny Bahn as \\"morphing into a topical, meta take on the ancient practice of telling people their future‚Äìonly this one comes via email with Beyonce GIFs and subtle appeals for self-empowerment.\\" In 2016, Solberg took over Room 1111 at The Standard, Downtown LA for 24 hours as part of 24HR PSYCHIC. Solberg has exhibited her Cry Wolf show at Munich‚Äôs Super + Centercourt Gallery. The show was inspired by nature and featured large tree trunks, paintings, drawings and mixed recordings of a river she painted next to with \\"the pieces examin[ing] Solberg's powerful experience of spending time in the woods, exploring both its beauty and its ferociousness.\\" Solberg was selected for the 2015 Summit Series Artist in Residency program. For this, she created Night Rider turning a snowcat vehicle into an art instillation at the top of a mountain in Eden, Utah. In 2015, Solberg was one of the artists invited by the Mama Shelter hotel to create art inspired by their mothers. Solberg contributed fireworks as her mom loves them. The same year she was a part of MAMA Gallery's To Hide To Show group exhibition. For this show Solberg \\"took on an entire room (the darkness of 'To Hide') which included site- specific work created on floor-to-ceiling reflective stainless steel panels as well as drawings dispersed on several dark and dimly lit charcoal walls.\\" As part of 2015's Art Basel Miami, she undertook Mister Lee's Shangri-La, a project which transformed the Soho Beach House into a pop-up strip club. This exhibit was a personal piece that represented female power, mortality and potential. This exhibit was subsequently featured in Los Angeles at MAMA Gallery. The following year curator Ashley Sands invited Solberg and seven other artists to contribute to Someplace Else Right Now, an art exhibition staged in Frank Zappa's studio. In October 2018, Solberg was invited by the Budapest Art Factory to spend one-month in Hungary to experience its art scene and develop new art. As part of this experience, she showcasedThe Writings on the Wall exhibit featuring installations made of found and repurposed materials.

Traditionally, the mens rea for murder was malice aforethought. While murder and voluntary manslaughter are both intentional homicides, adequate provocation mitigates a defendant's culpability. Adequate provocation is a legal requirement for a murder charge to be reduced to voluntary manslaughter. The test for adequate provocation varies across jurisdictions and has changed over time. The categorical approach is based on common law principles, but most courts today apply less restrictive tests, such as the extreme emotional disturbance test in Model Penal Code jurisdictions. Historical background The formal distinction between manslaughter and murder begins to emerge in the 16th century. As early as the 1550s, cases appear in law reports that begin to develop the jurisprudence of manslaughter. Provocation began to replace the earlier \\"hotbloodedness\\" when a landmark case from 1600 established that insults and rude gestures were not sufficient provocation to reduce a murder charge to manslaughter. After this case, judges began developed four common law \\"categories\\" of provocation:Kesselring, K.(2016-05-12). ‚ÄòMurder‚Äôs Crimson Badge‚Äô: Homicide in the Age of Shakespeare.

MacDonald. Topic This book is a study of early Christianity and the role of Christian women in the first two centuries. MacDonald uses the findings of cultural anthropology and models of analysis taken from modern sociology to study extant texts of pagan and Christian public opinion in an attempt to provide insight into the hidden lives of women. New Testament professor Rollin Ramsaran says, \\"Religion scholars will take note of how MacDonald applies these perspectives... MacDonald mounts a thorough examination of the sticky issues at stake and then offers a credible and persuasive defense for her applied perspectives.\\" Classics scholar A.M.Keith goes on to say \\"Her detailed discussion of the limits and possibilities of social-scientific models is extremely valuable and sets a new standard of methodological sophistication for scholars investigating the lives of women in Graeco-Roman antiquity.\\" Structure The book consists of three major components. Part 1 analyzes pagan comments and criticisms. Keith says MacDonald reconsiders ancient documents that are all well-known, yet MacDonald's approach uncovers new possibilities. MacDonald uses the empire's social expectations of women in terms of \\"honor\\" and \\"shame,\\" \\"public\\" and \\"private\\" and \\"informal power\\" verses \\"formal authority\\" to argue much of the vociferous pagan criticism of the early church was linked to early Christian \\"female initiative\\" which the empire saw as akin to sorcery. This negative pagan reaction showed women did in fact play a significant role in Christianity's beginnings. Accusations concerning women were among those used to influence public opinion about Christianity itself demonstrating its threat to the pagan social order.. > MacDonald explains \\"The [pagan critic's] focus on women draws attention to > the essence of a group where power is exercised in dangerous, illegitimate > ways, where the norms of the [Roman] household order are subverted, where > traditional male control of house and school is compromised, where the > public practices of religion are ignored in favor of a god who is worshipped > in private, and where the only wisdom comes from magic lore.\\" Academic theologian Peter Richardson explains MacDonald is a recognized Pauline scholar, and in the second section of the book, she accordingly turns her analysis to the Pauline literature. New Testament texts which most limit female activity are in the Pauline epistles, and according to classics scholar Constance McLeese these texts were likely prompted by a \\"concern for the Church‚Äôs public image\\" that resulted from pagan criticism and negative public opinion. MacDonald emphasizes negative public opinion in the Roman empire produced violence and impacted the church's ability to \\"evangelize\\". McLeese says MacDonald concludes early Christian women must have been acting as \\"proselytizers in their roles as wife, mother and household slaves.\\" > When looked at from this perspective some of the Pauline comments upon > marriage can be interpreted as being highly subversive. For example, the > counsel provided to women married to non-believers in I Cor. 7:12‚Äì16 and 1 > Pet. 3:1‚Äì6, far from enforcing the [Roman] status quo, advises a radical > course of action which is at direct odds with the ideal wife of the Greco- > Roman household.\\" The third and concluding section of the work is an analysis of the interrelationship between second century Christian comments on marriage and the development of marriage as a metaphor used within the Christian church. MacDonald suggests that \\"the link between the roles played by married Christian woman and this choice of symbolic language is far more ...affirmative of women than modern theories of patriarchy would allow.\\" MacDonald concludes that, even though it is accurate to say second century Christian women did not possess authority in the traditional Roman sense, they may still have possessed more informal power than is generally recognized in traditional feminist scholarship. Reception Reception of MacDonald's book has been positive. New Testament scholar Constance E. McLeese calls it \\"thought provoking\\" and a \\"remarkable book\\"; Stephen Benko refers to it as \\"a serious historical-exegetical study\\". Professor Rollin Ramsaran writes, \\"This is a well written, judiciously documented, and ambitious look at the role of women in early Christianity.\\" Classics Professor Allison M. Keith says it is \\"sensitively written and subtly argued.\\"  References  1996 non- fiction books Books about women Early Christianity ","title":"Early Christian Women and Pagan Opinion"},{"id":"56374009","text":"Sina Tehrani (born August 30, 1981 In Tehran, Iran) is an Iranian researcher, consultant, advisor, and expert on individual and organizational growth and excellence.

He is perhaps best known for his curation and donation of the 'WG Alma Conjuring Collection' to State Library Victoria.  Early years  Oswald George William Bishop was born in Malvern, Australia. His parents were Oswald Henry Bishop, a tinsmith by trade and a stage magician who performed under the stage name 'Alma, the Court Magician', and Rosetta Mary Long, a piano teacher. He was an only child. After his father abandoned the family and moved to the U.S.A, his mother forbade the young Bishop (later Alma) from considering magic as a career.  Career  After acquiring a copy of Magic Made Easy by David Devant, Bishop studied magic in secret, against his mother's wishes. His first performance was at an amateur talent contest at the Burke Road Congregational Church in Malvern at the age of 15 ‚Äì after which his mother accepted and supported his career as a stage magician. In 1949, Bishop changed his name by deed poll to William George Alma. He enjoyed a successful career as a performer and a manufacturer of conjuring apparatus and props, with a particular highlight being touring Australia and New Zealand with Levante as Technical Adviser and Technician Levante's 'How's Tricks' show. After having a heart attack, Alma retired from performing and turned his attention to curating the collection of magic memorabilia which would later become the WG Alma Conjuring Collection. In 1991 he was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia on the Queen's Birthday public holiday \\"for service as a magician and to the conservation of conjuring memorabilia.\\" In the same year he received a Presidential Citation from the International Brotherhood of Magicians for his services to magic.

From the time of its construction in the Middle Ages to 1945 it belonged to the House of Reu√ü. The schloss and village of Burgk lie on an exposed site on a rock plateau above the village of Burgkhammer and the eponymous reservoir on a bend in the Saale. It is nine kilometres from the A 9 motorway (Berlin‚ÄìMunich).  Description  The well preserved schloss still has the character of a castle, with many medieval details. For example, the original palas has survived in entirety, as has the bergfried and both stone bridges that lead to the inner ring and palas. Formerly both bridges were drawbridges. On the outer bridge, below the Amtshaus (\\"district office\\"), a toll tariff board is displayed. In 2016, during the opening of a Baroque wall, a medieval parlour or Bohlenstube was found, dating to 1402. When, in 1739, the second gatehouse was demolished, a chamber and a dog were found. This was probably offered as a sacrifice during construction about 400 years ago and walled alive into the building. Today the mummified dog is displayed in the entrance behind a glass window. The castle chapel and kitchens are well preserved. Particularly notable is the kitchen chimney. At the western end of the site is the Red Tower (Rote Turm) with a timber-framed top in the Late Renaissance style. The entrance to the Red Tower is along a covered chemin de ronde, from which three others run along the walls. In the centre of the mid-18th century French-style park south of the schloss is the Sophienlust pavilion; a late Baroque/Classicist style building.

It runs over a section of the original Eden Valley Railway in a north-westerly direction from the line's base at Warcop station. The line is run by the Eden Valley Railway Trust, formerly the Eden Valley Railway Society. The railway operates passenger trains from March to September on the weekends and Bank Holidays and some weekday workings in summer.  History  The original Eden Valley Railway opened in 1862, linking Penrith and Kirkby Stephen via Appleby-in-Westmorland. Passenger traffic ended in 1962 and the line was reduced to the track between the junction at Appleby station with the Settle-Carlisle Line and Kirkby Stephen which served a quarry. By 1976 all that was left was of track between Appleby in Westmorland and Flitholme. It was used by infrequent British Army services to Warcop Training Area until 1989. In 1995 the Eden Valley Railway Society was formed with the primary objective of restoring the Warcop to Appleby section of the line, and a secondary object of, if possible, extending it to Kirkby Stephen once the initial section was in operation. On 3 August 2004 the Eden Valley Railway Order 2004 came into action, allowing the trust to undertake railway operations (excluding non-self generated electrical railways) on the track from Appleby to Flitholme near Warcop.The Eden Valley Railway Order 2004, Statutory Instruments, 2004 No. 1817, Office for Public Sector Information, www.opsi.gov.uk Heritage railway services resumed in 2006 between Warcop and Sandford, with an extension of to Southfields being opened in 2013, giving a current running line of almost .

It was released nationwide in many Philippine cinemas on January 17, 2018. =Critical response= Mama's Girl was graded 'A' by the Cinema Evaluation Board. Pablo Tariman of The Philippine Star praised Macatuno's directing, noting how she delivered \\"with simple storytelling that hit the emotional mark without fanfare\\" and also Sylvia Sanchez's performance as compared to her other roles as mother on TV. Rappler's Oggs Cruz wrote, \\"Mama's Girl is hardly a perfect film but its subtle but sincere impressions are worth the price of the ticket\\". He called to attention an apparent lack of influence of men on the main characters and their development, while comparing it to Macatuno's previous film Rome and Juliet, saying that it was \\"definitely softer\\" than its predecessor.

History McKinley School, c. 1916 The first school in Vassar, a frame structure, was built in 1852; this was replaced in 1860 with a brick structure. As the population increased, an addition was made to that school in 1881. However, the district was still growing, and the decision was made to construct a second building to serve pupils living on the east side of the city. The McKinley School was constructed in 1886, and was originally known as the \\"East Primary Building.\\" However, soon after the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, the name was changed to the McKinley School. The building was used for classes by the school district until 1964. After that, it was used as storage by the school district until 1971, when it was sold to private owners. The school currently houses a dance studio. Description The McKinley School is a 1-1/2 story plain brick two-room schoolhouse on a stone foundation. The main entrance is through two double doors, located within an arched opening and surmounted by a fan light. The windows are in segmented arched openings. A 40 foot tall tower once held the school bell. Inside are two rooms, both 27 feet by 33 feet. A small kitchenette is in the rear, and the building contains bathrooms and a coatroom.

Becerra, 585 U.S. ___ (2018), was a case before the Supreme Court of the United States addressing the constitutionality of California's FACT Act, which mandated that crisis pregnancy centers provide certain disclosures about state services. The law required that licensed centers post visible notices that other options for pregnancy, including abortion, are available from state-sponsored clinics. It also mandated that unlicensed centers post notice of their unlicensed status. The centers, typically run by Christian non-profit groups, challenged the act on the basis that it violated their free speech. After prior reviews in lower courts, the case was brought to the Supreme Court, asking \\"Whether the disclosures required by the California Reproductive FACT Act violate the protections set forth in the free speech clause of the First Amendment, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.\\"National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, SCOTUSblog. The Court ruled on June 26, 2018, in a 5‚Äì4 decision that the notices required by the FACT Act violate the First Amendment by targeting speakers rather than speech.  Background  A crisis pregnancy center (CPC) is a type of nonprofit organization established to counsel pregnant women against having an abortion. CPCs provide peer counseling related to abortion, pregnancy, and childbirth, and they may offer non-medical services such as financial assistance, child-rearing resources, and adoption referrals. CPCs that qualify as medical clinics may provide pregnancy testing, sonograms, and other services. CPCs are typically run by pro-life Christians according to a conservative Christian philosophy, and thus do not recommend abortion as an option for pregnancy. Medical professionals and abortion-rights advocates allege that CPCs omit information, provide false or misleading information regarding abortion, and may lead women to unsafe medical options. Cities like Baltimore, Austin, and New York passed legislation to require CPCs to disclose their status and that they did not offer abortion services, but organizations representing the CPCs have been successful in courts challenging these laws, principally on the argument that forcing the CPCs to post such language violated their First Amendment rights and constituted compelled speech. Based on a report prepared by NARAL Pro- Choice America, which alleged that CPCs were providing misleading and inaccurate information, the California State Legislature passed the Reproductive FACT (Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care, and Transparency) Act (AB-775) in October 2015. It required any licensed healthcare facility that provided care services related to pregnancies to post a notice that stated \\"California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women.\\" The law set provisions where this notice was to be posted and established civil fines if facilities did not comply. The Act required unlicensed facilities which offered certain pregnancy-related services to post a notice stating: \\"This facility is not licensed as a medical facility by the State of California and has no licensed medical provider who provides or directly supervises the provision of all of the services, whose primary purpose is providing pregnancy-related services.\\" Whereas the previous attempts at regulating CPCs in Baltimore and other cities were based on having signage that informed the patient that the CPC did not offer abortion-related services, the FACT Act instead makes the patient aware of state-sponsored services that are available rather than what the CPCs did or did not offer. The law went into effect January 1, 2016. =Procedural history= CPCs and the Pacific Justice Institute filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the Reproductive FACT Act. The CPCs asserted that the law's requirements constituted compelled speech in violation of their rights to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion under the First Amendment. Among these was a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California by the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) who represented over 100 CPCs in California. NIFLA sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the Reproductive FACT Act from coming into force on January 1, 2016, while the lawsuit continued. The Court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction in February 2016. NIFLA appealed from the denial of the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in June 2016, which affirmed the judgment of the District Court in a unanimous decision authored by Judge Dorothy W. Nelson, joined by Judges A. Wallace Tashima and John B. Owens. The Ninth Circuit decision noted that the existence of a circuit split on the issue of the proper level of scrutiny to apply in cases relating to abortion-related disclosures, and agreed with the Fourth Circuit that the Supreme Court's decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. did not resolve this question. The Court held that the notice that the state required to be posted in licensed facilities constituted professional speech, subject to intermediate scrutiny, and that the notice survived intermediate scrutiny because California has \\"a substantial interest in the health of its citizens, including ensuring that its citizens have access to and adequate information about constitutionally-protected medical services like abortion\\" and because the notice was \\"narrowly drawn to achieve California's substantial interests.\\" The Court further held that the required notice for unlicensed facilities would survive any standard of review--even strict scrutiny--holding that \\"California has a compelling interest in informing pregnant women when they are using the medical services of a facility that has not satisfied licensing standards set by the state. And given the Legislature‚Äôs findings regarding the existence of CPCs, which often present misleading information to women about reproductive medical services, California‚Äôs interest in presenting accurate information about the licensing status of individual clinics is particularly compelling.\\" The Court also ruled that the petitioners had no likelihood of success on their claim that the law violated their rights under the Free Exercise Clause. Citing Employment Division v. Smith, the court held that the law was a \\"neutral law of general applicability, subject to only rational basis review.\\" The Ninth Circuit denied a motion for rehearing en banc in December 2016. Supreme Court NIFLA filed a petition for writ of certiorari in March 2017, asking the Supreme Court to hear the case, pointing to the circuit split identified in the Ninth Circuit's decision. NIFLA specifically asked the Court to decide the question of \\"Whether the Free Speech Clause or the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment prohibits California from compelling licensed pro-life centers to post information on how to obtain a state-funded abortion and from compelling unlicensed pro-life centers to disseminate a disclaimer to clients on site and in any print and digital advertising.\\" The Court agreed to hear the case in November 2017. NIFLA was represented by Alliance Defending Freedom. Oral arguments were held on March 20, 2018. Observers of the arguments believed the Court favored the CPCs and agreed with their arguments that the legal requirements of the Reproductive FACT Act not only burdened the free speech of the centers, but also put a burden on the centers to post the noticefor example, CPCs in Los Angeles County would be required to post the notice in 13 different languages. At oral argument, a number of justices said they believed that the FACT Act was written specifically to target CPCs; Justice Elena Kagan questioned whether that the law was \\"gerrymandered\\" to impact CPCs rather than all pregnancy service providers.Oral argument transcript, National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra (S. Ct. No. 16-1140): \\"JUSTICE KAGAN: There is a -- a sense when you read this statute ... here's at least a question that arises as to whether this statute has been gerrymandered.\\" The Court also considered the FACT Act in relationship to the Court's previous ruling of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld the constitutionality of a Pennsylvanian law that required doctors performing abortions to provide their clients with health information related to them. =Opinion of the Court= The Court announced judgment on June 26, 2018 in favor of the challengers. In the 5‚Äì4 decision, split between the conservative and liberal justices, the Court ruled that both notices required by the FACT Act violated the free speech principles of the First Amendment, reversing the Ninth Circuit's decision and remanding the case there for review. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Roberts, Kennedy, Alito, and Gorsuch. Thomas identified that the FACT Act targeted the speaker of the language demanded by the Act rather than the speech itself, which conflicted with the First Amendment. He wrote that the FACT Act \\"imposes a government- scripted, speaker-based disclosure requirement that is wholly disconnected from the State‚Äôs informational interest\\", and because it only applied to a specific classification of facilities, it could be seen as compelled speech for those in the CPCs that disagreed with the state's stance on abortion. Thomas' opinion rejected the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the FACT Act was equivalent to \\"professional speech\\", defined through Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, as \\"factual, noncontroversial information\\" that is less protected by the First Amendment, as the FACT Act notice dealt with the controversial topic of abortion. Instead, Thomas argued, the state could use public advertising or even post public notices near the CPCs to achieve the same message without violating the First Amendment. In regards to the notice for unlicensed centers, Thomas found that the state had not proved anything more than a \\"purely hypothetical\\" harm that the notices were to remedy, following Ibanez v. Florida Dept. of Business and Professional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, , and even if they had demonstrated such harm, the notices would still run afoul of the First Amendment challenges. =Concurrence and dissent= Justice Kennedy wrote a concurrence, which was also joined by Roberts, Alito, and Gorsuch, which further asserted that the FACT Act was specifically targeting pro-life centers, describing it as \\"This law is a paradigmatic example of the serious threat presented when government seeks to impose its own message in the place of individual speech, thought, and expression\\". Justice Breyer wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. Breyer took issue with the majority's take on the First Amendment, using a heightened standard to test the First Amendment applicability as established from Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., . Breyer also criticized the majority's opinion in light of the Court's decision from Planned Parenthood v. Casey, , in which the Court affirmed the constitutionality of a law requiring physicians to provide women considering abortions with information related to adoption. Breyer wrote \\"a Constitution that allows States to insist that medical providers tell women about the possibility of adoption should also allow States similarly to insist that medical providers tell women about the possibility of abortion\\".

Released direct-to-video, it stars Samuel Binkert as a down on his luck loser who begins punishing sinners at the behest of an angel played by Denise Meili.  Plot  Michael Luhser, a lifeless misanthrope, returns home from his dead- end office job to find a woman waiting for him. The woman, who claims to be an angel, informs Michael that he has been chosen by God to enact His will on Earth by smiting those who break the Ten Commandments. Michael initially refuses to believe the woman, but after she displays supernatural powers he reluctantly goes out in search of a victim, finding one in the form of a purse-snatching drug addict who he stabs and disembowels. With the angel's encouragement, Michael commits more murders, butchering his unscrupulous boss and the man's lover, and then a dominatrix and her married client. When Michael begins to lose his resolve and become remorseful, the angel coerces him into continuing his rampage by having sex with him, and later by allowing him to drink her divine blood. Michael subsequently breaks into a laboratory, where he guns down a scientist who has been performing unethical experiments on animals. While fleeing the scene, Michael gets into an altercation with a drunk, who beats him. A bystander rushes to the dazed Michael's aid, but runs away upon noticing that his bag is full of weapons. After filing a report with the police, the woman returns to her apartment, which Michael has broken into. Michael proceeds to chase the woman out of the building and into the surrounding woods, where he slits her throat. After killing the woman, Michael goes on a bender and eventually passes out at home, only to be awakened by a policeman barging into his room. As the officer orders him to drop his gun and surrender, a boastful Michael commits suicide by shooting himself in the expectation that he will ascend to Heaven. Michael is instead condemned to Hell, and the film ends with him going into hysterics as he is taunted by the angel, who was in reality a demon all along.

The company was founded in 1948 by Joseph Dickinson and his brother Edgar Dickinson. The company is named after the farm in Hade Edge, near Holmfirth in West Yorkshire at which the dairy was formerly based and all of its products are popular across the north of England with certain key products, cottage cheese in particular, being popular nationally and others popular internationally. History The company was founded in 1948 by Joseph and Edgar Dickinson after they inherited a farm near to Holmfirth in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Initially just having a few head of cattle, they farmed the land and with their herd of Jersey cows they first started producing cream in 1954 after wartime food rationing had ended. In the early days of the venture, Joseph Dickinson would deliver products to the Morrisons market stall run by Ken Morrison in Bradford. The company branched out into making yoghurts and after Joseph Dickinson had visited an American farm in the early 1970s, they also started making cottage cheese. To start with, the cheese was made in tin baths and stirred with hay rakes before more suitable processes were adapted. Longley Farm were the first European company to make cottage cheese on an industrial scale and sell it. The cottage cheese brand is very popular in France, despite initial predictions that you could not sell a non-French sounding cheese to the French. As well as owning their own 250-strong herd of Jersey cattle, the company takes milk from another 80 farms across Yorkshire, of which, 25 are Jersey herds. They process over of milk per year. The first commercial wind turbine in Great Britain was installed at Longley Farm in 1986. It was rated at 90 kW and stood at over high. It was replaced in September 2015 with a newer model which is tall and produces 400 kWh. In 1990, the brothers Dickinson bought a farm near Barnsley. All the cattle were moved to this farm and as such, the dairy processing was moved there too. Production of cheese and yoghurts was retained at the Longley Farm site. Both Dickinson brothers retired in 1997 and Joseph's son, Jimmy, took over running the business. Food scare In 2003, three Yorkshire pensioners from the Huddersfield area, died from a strain of listeria which was determined to be in butter that they had consumed. As a precaution, Longley Farm withdrew certain products from sale and recalled other batches of stock. An investigation later determined that the farm was clean and the poisoning outbreak had nothing to do with any Longley Farm product. At that time, it was the first health scare connected with the company in its 55-year history. Popularity The firms products regularly feature in the winners category for dairy products at the Great Yorkshire Show and have grown to be popular outside of Yorkshire with many people enjoying them internationally. Some of the supermarkets in the United Kingdom sell Longley Farm products throughout Yorkshire, with Morrisons and Asda selling them nationally. The Telegraph described the yoghurts produced by Longley farm as being \\"...natural, exceptionally good and simple fruit yogurts from this small dairy.\\" References Dairy products companies of the United Kingdom British companies established in 1948 Companies based in Kirklees Brand name yogurts ","title":"Longley Farm"},{"id":"56374704","text":"Song Gyo-sik (born 1925) was a South Korean athlete.
