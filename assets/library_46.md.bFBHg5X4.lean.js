Much of his oeuvre consists of paintings inspired by the life and geography of the West Coast of the United States, particularly California. Brandt worked in multiple mediums including print making, oil painting and watercolor painting. He gained national recognition for his watercolor painting during the period from the mid 1930s to the 1990s. Early in his career he was associated with California Scene Painting but after World War II Brandt focused on complex, semi-abstract works. The depiction of the regenerative warmth of the sun was a central focus of his painting; he wrote that \\"Everyone has hang-ups, I suppose. Mine is sunshine. Not sunlight -- although I like to paint sunlight too.\\" Brandt was an influential educator through his many years of teaching and publishing. He taught at numerous educational institutions including Riverside Junior College and the Chouinard Art Institute. Along with the painter Phil Dike, he opened the Brandt-Dike Summer School of Painting in 1947 at his home in Corona del Mar where he continued to teach summer classes for thirty-eight years. He published his first book of watercolor instruction in 1948 and continued to write and publish throughout his life. In 1993 he was awarded an American Artist Achievement Award for his teaching. Life Rex Brandt was born in 1914 in San Diego, California to Alfred O. Brandt, a Swedish immigrant, and Ellen Dale Woodward. His family later moved to Los Angeles and then Riverside, California were he graduated from high school. While still in high school he took art classes at the Chouinard School of Art. He attended Riverside Junior College and went on to get his bachelor's degree at the University of California, Berkeley in 1936. While at Berkeley he was exposed to the ideas of Hans Hoffman, who had recently taught there. He studied Chinese landscape painting, Byzantine art, and the modernist painters Cezanne, Picasso, and Matisse. Brandt returned to Riverside Junior College as a professor of Art in 1937. Also in that year, he helped organize an exhibition of forty-five paintings by artists, many of whom are associated with California Scene Painting. Among the artists represented were Brandt, Millard Sheets, Barse Miller, Phil Dike, Milford Zornes, and George Post. In March 1938 Brandt married the sculptor and painter Joan Irving, whom he had met at Riverside Junior College. Then in 1943 Brandt, having left Riverside Junior College, moved with his young family to Corona del Mar, just south of Newport Beach, where they had purchased property. Brandt named his property \\"Blue Sky\\" and it was there he lived and worked throughout the rest of his life. He opened a summer painting school at \\"Blue Sky\\" in 1947 and the school remained in operation through 1985 when it closed due to increasing urbanization. Brandt also expanded his sources of income beyond painting and teaching; he worked as a designer for West Coast Ship Building and formed his own commercial and residential design firm, Rex Brandt Associates. Brandt was active in the civic life of the Newport Beach area; he was one of the original members of the Parks, Beaches and Recreation Commission of Newport Beach, he designed the city's official seal, and helped plan the state beach at Corona Del Mar. Brandt also spent considerable time in the San Juan Islands. He purchased property on Orcas Island in 1964. Then in 1966 Brandt and his wife built a second home on Shaw Island where they typically spent a few months a year. During his time in the San Juans, Brandt reestablished his print making practice, he wrote: \\"I've turned again to an early love of block cutting because its power and simplicity express the way I feel about the San Juan Islands.\\" He died at his home in Corona del Mar at the age of 85.

Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 2005 by zoologist Paul Velazco. Its description was the result of a taxonomic split in Thomas's broad-nosed bat, P. dorsalis. The holotype had been collected in May 1987 near Balsas District, Peru. Phylogenetically, it belongs to the \\"Andean\\" clade of its genus. Other members of this clade are P. albericoi, P. aurarius, P. chocoensis, P. dorsalis, P. infuscus, P. masu, P. nigellus, and P. vittatus. P. masu is the sister taxa of P. ismaeli, or its closest relative. The eponym of the species name is Ismael Ceballos Bendezú, a Peruvian mammalogist. Velazco named the species after him \\"in recognition of his important contributions to the study of Peruvian bats.\\" Description It is a medium- sized member of its genus, with a forearm length of and a body mass of . The fur on its back is dark brown, and its ventral fur is grayish. It has dark facial stripes of differing sizes. It has a stripe running down the length of its spine that is lighter than its facial stripes. Its nose-leaf is longer than it is wide. Males and females are similar in appearance. Biology Little is known about its reproduction. A pregnant female was once documented in late January, while another female with more advanced pregnancy was documented in early March. It is \\"basically frugivorous\\". Range and habitat It has been documented on both sides of the Andes in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. It occurs at relatively high elevation, from above sea level. It is often found in montane forests. Conservation It is currently evaluated as near-threatened by the IUCN. Its most recent assessment in 2016 was a down- listing from its 2008 assessment as vulnerable. It meets the criteria for near-threatened because its habitat quality and extent is decreasing rapidly, which may negatively affect its population. While there was a suspected population decline from 2001-2015, it is suspected that it was less than 30%.

Biography L'Arbre à palabres in Douala, Cameroun L'Arbre à palabres, detail Frédéric Keiff is a postgraduate at the Faculty of Arts of Strasbourg in 2000, graduated in architecture at the ENSAS of Strasbourg in 2001. Since then, he devoted himself to ar(t)chitectural research, in-between urban self-built collective experiments, and personal plastic research. In 2001 he founded the collective 3RS Charles Altorffer in Strasbourg. He is an active member of the first hour in the EXYZT group formed in 2003 in Paris. After graduation in 2001, he started a reflection on the human body as a unit of architecture, referring to Vitruvius, Leonardo da Vinci, Le Corbusier, to determine the archetype to place at the heart of contemporary architecture. But rather than marring an ideal, a perfect modular, his quest is more about the definition of a variable geometry model, incorporating therein the particulars and deformities of all. He questions the differences that make humanity what it is, i.e. a set of non- interchangeable singularities. In recent years, light has taken a special place in his artistic production with the construction of special windows, such as recovering debris of glass and assembling them on flexible silicone structures. In 2006, he worked on Vitraux Vivo at Mozet, Belgium. In 2007, in residence in Douala, he offers the city the work Arbre à palabres (Palaver Tree). In 2011 he participated in the group exhibition A view of urbanity organized by the General Council of 67 in Strasbourg (France). In 2013 he did the performance the Surviving Pablo at La Semencerie in Strasbourg (France) and, in the same year, he offered the city of Le Havre (France) the work Arbōat, a monumental sculpture created in collaboration with Coal. Recently, he worked on The Feasting Mouth (2014), a monumental sculpture project carried out with the Tate Modern of London, United Kingdom, as well as the collective exhibition Ateliers Nomades, Depo2015 in the Cultural Capital of 2015, Pilsen (Czech Republic).

Meath in 1950. Tyrrell graduated from NCAD in 1974. In 1984 Tyrell moved to Allihies on the Beara Peninsula in West Cork where he lives and works. He exhibits regularly at the Taylor Galleries, Dublin and is a member of Aosdána. He represented Ireland at the Paris Biennale in 1982 His work is in the collection of both Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Hugh Lane Gallery. His first solo exhibition took place in the Project Arts Centre, Dublin in 1974 Tyrrell taught at the Dun Laoghaire School of Art from 1977 to 1981. Tyrrell was nominated for the Savills Art Prize in 2017. Materials and Process In the early 1980s, when St Peter's Church on Aungier Street in Dublin was being demolished Tyrrell salvaged timber from the building which became the material for a series of three-dimensional paintings. When working with wood Tyrrell uses number of techniques as well as applying paint including cutting, scoring, burning and sanding. In addition to painting on wood and canvas in around the year 2000 Tyrrell began to make paintings on aluminium. For two years from 2013, he worked exclusively on aluminium. Describing his work on aluminium in 2014 Tyrrell said “The core of these pieces is that I work with metal spatulas and lay on paint...It's a very particular engagement with the paint. Laying it on, scraping it off. Laying on a lot and pulling back, and allowing the metal come through. It's a constant process of laying on and removing paint and, very often, just leaving these very little thin, residual lines. It was like drawing with paint in a very particular kind of way, using these metal spatulas.” Tyrell has also exhibited drawings both on paper and directly on gallery walls. Aidan Dunne, The Irish Times, February 28, 2007 Influences Tyrrell visited America in the 80s and has cited Colour Field Painters Kenneth Nolan and Morris Louis as well as Mark Rothko, and the Abstract Expressionists more generally as early influences. He has referenced Minimalism and the artist Sol LeWitt in particular as influences saying “Minimalism is my base line. Looking at Sol Lewitt I appreciate its mathematical reductivism but I always come forward from that.” He has also said that ancient Assyrian relief sculpture had influenced his work in an interview with Brian McAvera. Critical Response Patrick T. Murphy, director of the Royal Hibernian Academy has written “Charles Tyrrell is probably the best painter of his generation in Ireland” Aidan Dunne, who has written extensively on Tyrrell's work in both catalogue essays and in the Irish Times has said Tyrrell's work should be viewed in the context of such artists as Bridget Riley, Agnes Martin, Giorgio Morandi and Mark Rothko https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/art-and-design/visual-art/charles-tyrrell- finds-human-fallibility-in-the-logic-of-the-grid-visual-art-1.2326809  References  1950 births Modern painters 20th- century Irish painters 21st-century Irish painters Irish male painters Modern printmakers Irish contemporary artists 20th-century printmakers Living people ","title":"Charles Tyrrell (artist)"},{"id":"56463867","text":"J-CODE, an acronym for Joint Criminal Opioid Darknet Enforcement, is an FBI operation announced by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on January 29, 2018, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania which targets illegal opioid distribution on the Internet.

The church is the last remaining church in Centralia, which was largely abandoned after a mining accident rendered much of the town unsafe.  History  The church was built in 1911, at which time Centralia was a thriving coal mining community. Many of the miners and miners' families who formed the congregation of the church were immigrants from Eastern Europe. In May 1962 a mine fire broke out in the coal seams under Centralia, an event which resulted in the majority of the town's population leaving over the following decades. Despite the continuously burning fires (which are expected to burn for hundreds of years), the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Ukrainian Catholic Church remained open. In 1987 a survey under the church found that the structure was built on top of rock rather than coal, and so plans to demolish the church were abandoned. The persistence of the congregation gain notoriety, and the church became an unofficial pilgrimage site for Ukrainian Catholics. In 2015 Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk officially declared the church a pilgrimage site.

On 4 December 2017, Cabinet agreed to establish an inquiry into abuse in state care under the Inquiries Act 2013. It also agreed that a Ministerial Working Group be set up to consider the potential scope and implementation of the Inquiry, led by the Minister for Children/of Internal Affairs supported by the Minister for Social Development. The terms of the inquiry were announced in November 2018, and at that time the scope was widened from covering abuse in state care to include abuse in faith based institutions. The Department of Internal Affairs is now responsible for administering the independent Inquiry. The Rt Hon Sir Anand Satyanand was appointed as the Inquiry Chair and member of the Inquiry. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Minister for Children Tracey Martin gave details of the inquiry which was formally established on 1 February 2018. In August 2019, Satyanand announced his resignation from the Commission. In a surprise announcement, he cited the growing workload, which was higher than predicted, and his age of 75. He left the Commission in November 2019 and became the chancellor of Waikato University. Coral Shaw took over as chair, and Julia Steenson joined the Commission in June 2020. The work of the Commission was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, with reduced sessions from March through June 2020.  Commissioners  * Judge Coral Shaw – Chair * Sandra Alofivae MNZN – Commissioner * Dr Andrew Erueti – Commissioner * Paul Gibson – Commissioner * Julia Steenson – Commissioner * TBD – Commissioner Simon Mount QC is the Commission’s Counsel Assist.  Criticisms  The inquiry faced criticism for appointing a gang member into a key role. Mongrel Mob member Harry Tam was employed as the inquiry's head of policy and research. An abuse survivor accused the Commission of shutting down questions into conflicts of interest, saying that when he asked about commissioners' involvement with religious organisations, commissioners intervened to prevent further questions. The survivor received two letters of apology over the incident. It was also criticised after some survivors were unclear on whether interviews they had done were part of the official hearings or were 'mock' sessions. Some survivors where concerned that evidence from those sessions would not be used and that they would need to repeat traumatising sessions. Commissioner Sandra Alofivae said that the interviews were official and evidence from them would be used, describing the sessions as \\"soft pilots\\". A child sex offender was allowed to attend meetings with sexual violence survivors. The man, who is on the child sex offender register, was a partner of a person attending a panel. The Commission took three months after learning that the man had convictions to determine what they were. Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin said that her confidence in the commissioner \\"had been shaken\\" but later expressed confidence in the Commission. Senior Commissioner Paul Gibson faced calls to resign but refused to do so.

The Rebels compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The football team was the first in the state of Mississippi when it was formed in 1893. The program ranks 26th on the list of college football's all-time winning programs. Ole Miss claims three national championships (1959, 1960, 1962) and six SEC championships (1947, 1954, 1955, 1960, 1962, 1963). The Rebels are coached by Lane Kiffin. Overview=Early history (1893–1946)= In 1890, Dr. Alexander Bondurant, later the dean of the Ole Miss Graduate School, rallied Ole Miss students to help form an athletic department to encompass the sports of football, baseball and tennis. The students brought this initiative to reality and in 1893, with Bondurant as the coach, a football team came to fruition. The first team won four of five games during that inaugural football season with Bondurant as head coach. One of those wins was the very first football game ever played by an Ole Miss team, a 56–0 defeat against Southwest Baptist University of Jackson, Tennessee (now known as Union University). This was on November 11, 1893. The next year, 1894, Bondurant passed on his coaching duties. Ole Miss Football, a book published in 1980 by Sports Yearbook Company of Oxford, MS, says J.W.S. Rhea was the first coach at Ole Miss having been hired part-time by Bondurant and having led the 1894 team to a 6–1 record. The annual Ole Miss media guide lists C.D. Clark as the coach of the 1894 team and further says about him, \\"Although it has never been documented, it is thought that C.D. Clark of Tufts was the first paid football coach at Ole Miss. His name appears as manager of the team as shown in the Ole Miss Magazine dated November 1894.\\"Ole Miss Sports: History of Rebel Football The College Football Data Warehouse also lists Clark as the coach for the 1894 team. Coach Hollister In 1896, John W. Hollister led the Rebels to a 1–2 record. Ole Miss did not field a football team in 1897; a yellow fever epidemic cancelled the football season. In 1898 the school joined the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA). The 1899 team went 3–4 and beat a winless Tulane. The 1900 team did not win a game and played no home games. The 1901 team was coached by Virginia graduate William Shibley, won no conference games, and played in the first Egg Bowl. Auburn graduates Daniel S. Martin and Mike Harvey coached the 1902 and 1903 teams. The 1903 team's one loss was 33–0 to Vanderbilt. The 1904 season was up-and-down, featuring a 69–0 loss to SIAA champion Vanderbilt and 114–0 defeat of Southwest Baptist. Vanderbilt was led by first year head coach Dan McGugin, who is the only coach in NCAA history to win his first three games by 60 points, \\"The whole South read that 69–0 score and gasped.\\" The 1905 team lost both of its two games, against Cumberland and in the Egg Bowl. All-Southern lineman James C. Elmer caught the first forward pass in the history of the Egg Bowl rivalry in 1906. Elmer's kicking accounted for 13 points in a 29–5 rout. In Frank A. Mason's only season as head coach, Mississippi went 0–6. In what would be his final game as head coach, Ole Miss faced rival Mississippi A&M; on a cold, wet Thanksgiving Day. Before the second half began, Mason brought out an urn filled with whisky-laced coffee in an attempt to warm his players. Sloppy second-half play resulted in a 15–0 Ole Miss loss. After the game, many of the players blamed Mason for the loss and when asked if the team was returning home that night, Mason was quoted as saying \\"Yes, the team is going north at 11 o'clock. I'm going in another direction, and hope I never see them again!\\" Former Vanderbilt quarterback Frank Kyle coached the 1908 team and Ike Knox was selected All-Southern. Grantland Rice wrote “If Knox has been upon a Vanderbilt, Sewanee or Auburn eleven he would more than likely have been hailed as one of the greatest halfbacks of the decade.” Nathan Stauffer served as the head coach for the 1909, 1910 and 1911 seasons. His record at Ole Miss was 17 wins, 7 losses and 2 ties (17–7–2). The 1910 team lost just one game, to SIAA champion Vanderbilt. Guard Earl Kinnebrew was selected All-Southern. Rube Barker and By Walton were All-Southern in 1911, and Pete Shields was in the backfield. Barker, John C. Adams, and Ralph Fletcher were All-Southern in 1912. William L. Driver coached the 1913 team and Barker was team captain. The 1914 team shutout LSU. Former Vanderbilt quarterback Fred A. Robins coached the team from 1915 to 1916, and failed to win a conference game. During the First World War, Ole Miss was coached by Dudy Noble, the only coach to lose two Egg Bowls in one season. He also coached baseball, and is the namesake of Dudy Noble Field. From 1919 to 1921, Ole Miss football was coached by R. L. Sullivan, who also coached basketball. In 1922 the school joined the Southern Conference (SoCon). Roland Cowell coached the team from 1922 to 1923, and failed to win a conference game. Chester S. Barnard was coach in 1924 and also failed to win a conference game. In February 1925, Homer Hazel signed on to become the head football coach at Ole Miss. Thad Vann, who played for Hazel at Ole Miss from 1926 to 1929, later credited Hazel with \\"launching the University of Mississippi's rise as a national football power\\". Hazel coached the team for five years, compiling records of 5–5 in 1925, 5–4 in 1926, 5–3–1 in 1927, 5–4 in 1928, and 1–6–2 in 1929. His five-year record as head football coach was 21–22–3. End Ap Applewhite, guard V. K. Smith and fullback Sollie Cohen were All-Southern in 1927. Gee Walker was on the 1928 team. After the poor showing in 1929, the Ole Miss student body and alumni were reportedly opposed to Hazel's tactics on the football field. Hazel resigned his post at Ole Miss in January 1930. Leading Ole Miss into the Southeastern Conference in 1933 was head coach Ed Walker, who served as the school's head coach from 1930 to 1937. The Rebels compiled a record of 38–38–8 record under Walker, which included a 9–3 campaign in 1935, which culminated in a loss in the Orange Bowl. The 1936 team was the first to use the nickname \\"Rebels\\".http://www.oxfordeagle.com/2015/11/01/the-colonel-and-the-rebels- in-36-37/ Under head coach Harry Mehre, who led the Rebels from 1938 to 1945, the Rebels compiled a record of 39–26–1, which included two 9–2 seasons in 1938 and 1940. In 1943, football was abolished at all Mississippi state- supported institutions by the state college Board of Trustees due to World War II. On January 14, 1946, the University of Mississippi announced that it had signed Harold Drew to a three-year contract to succeed Mehre as the head football coach for the Ole Miss Rebels. Drew led Ole Miss to a record in his one year as head coach. 1947 Ole Miss media guide featuring Charlie Conerly (left) and coach Johnny Vaught (right) =Johnny Vaught era (1947–1970)= Johnny Vaught, a line coach at Ole Miss in 1946 under Drew and a former All- American at Texas Christian University (TCU), remained in Oxford as head coach in 1947 and led the Ole Miss program to national prominence over the next 24 years, posting 23 winning records. In his first season at the helm in 1947, the Rebels posted a 9–2 record and won the first of six SEC crowns (1947, 1954, 1955, 1960, 1962, 1963). That 1947 season also saw Ole Miss great Charlie Conerly become the first Rebel player to be a contender for the Heisman Trophy, placing fourth in the voting for the prestigious honor. Ole Miss won the 1959 Dunkel System national crown, the 1960 Football Writers Association of America, Dunkel System, and Williamson System national championships and the 1962 Litkenhous Ratings national title. Vaught's 1962 squad remains the only undefeated team in Ole Miss football history. Vaught's 1959 squad, which was honored as the \\"SEC Team of the Decade,\\" was ranked the third best collegiate football team from 1956 to 1995, according to the Jeff Sagarin Ratings released in January 1996. The Rebels were also among the winningest programs in the country under Vaught during the 1950s and 1960s. From 1950 to 1959, Ole Miss posted an 80–21–5 record (.778 winning percentage). The 77.8 winning percentage was third to only Oklahoma and Miami (OH) during that decade. In the 1960s, Vaught guided the Rebels to a 77–25–6 record and a 74.0 winning percentage, which was the ninth best during that decade. The Rebels 1962 season under Vaught is, to this day, the only undefeated season in Ole Miss history. The Rebels ended that season 10–0 and as national champions. In the 1950s and 1960s under Vaught, Ole Miss was a fixture in the national polls. The Rebels were ranked atop the Associated Press poll for three weeks during the 1960 season and one week during the 1961 campaign. In 1964, Ole Miss was ranked preseason No. 1 in the Associated Press poll. Vaught also made going to postseason play the norm rather than the exception for the Rebel football program. Ole Miss played in 15 consecutive bowl games from 1957 to 1971 which, at that time, was a national record. In all, Vaught led Ole Miss to 18 bowl game appearances, posting a 10–8 record in those contests. For his efforts, Vaught was named SEC Coach of the Year six times (1947, 1948, 1954, 1955, 1960, 1962). #18 Archie Manning awaiting the snap in a 1969 game against the Tennessee Volunteers During his time at the helm, Vaught coached some of the best players ever to wear the red & navy blue. In 24 seasons, Vaught produced 18 All-America first teamers. He also coached four players who finished in the top five in the Heisman Trophy voting. Along with Conerly in 1947, Charlie Flowers (5th in 1959), Jake Gibbs (3rd in 1960) and Archie Manning (4th in 1969, 3rd in 1970) were in the running for college football's top honor. Failing health forced Vaught to resign his position in 1970 and the reins of the Ole Miss football program were turned over to Billy Kinard. Vaught is the only coach in Ole Miss history to win an SEC football championship. His 1960 team finished 10–0–1 and was the only major-conference team to go undefeated on the field that year. As a result, it won a share of the national championship; it was awarded the Grantland Rice Award from the Football Writers Association of America after the bowl games. In those days, the wire services crowned their national champion before the bowl games. It is very likely that Ole Miss would have finished atop one poll, if not both, had they been taken after the bowl games as they are today. Vaught took Ole Miss to 18 bowl games, winning 10 times including five victories in the Sugar Bowl. Only two coaches held a winning record against Vaught: Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant, with a record of 7 wins, 6 losses, and 1 tie against Vaught, and Robert Neyland holding a 3 win to two loss advantage. When Vaught took the reins at Ole Miss in 1947, the Rebels were ninth in all-time SEC wins. By the time he retired in 1970, the Rebels had moved up to third, behind only Alabama and Tennessee. Billy Kinard became the first Ole Miss alumnus to head up the football program after Vaught's resignation. The Rebels went 16–9 under Kinard, including a 10–2 record and a 41–18 Peach Bowl victory over Georgia Tech in his first year in 1971. Kinard's 10 victories are tied for fourth most by a first-year head coach in NCAA Division I history. Kinard coached the Rebels through the 1972 season and through the third game of the 1973 season. After the disappointing 5–5 season in 1972, there was some pressure among the alumni to have Kinard removed. The administration bowed to this pressure after the Rebels started the 1973 season 1–2, including a shutout loss to Missouri, 17–0, and was upset by Memphis, 17–13. Both Billy Kinard and Frank Kinard were fired, and Johnny Vaught was rehired as both the head coach and athletic director. Following the 1973 football season, Vaught resigned once again as head coach, but remained on as athletic director. His final record with the Rebels was 190–61–12. The 190 victories still rank Vaught in the top 25 winningest coaches in NCAA Division I history, and he is the fourth-winningest coach in SEC history. In 1979, Vaught was inducted in the National College Football Hall of Fame. =Ken Cooper era (1974–1977)= On January 17, 1974, Ken Cooper was announced as the 29th Ole Miss head football coach. An end during his playing days at Georgia from 1955–1957 under Wally Butts, Cooper had previously been an assistant coach at Georgia from 1963–1970 under Johnny Griffith and Vince Dooley and with the Rebels from 1971–1973 under Johnny Vaught and Billy Kinard. Cooper compiled a 21–23 record during his four years as head coach. Ole Miss finished 3–8 in 1974. They kicked off the season with a 10–0 win over #10 Missouri. After falling to rival Memphis the next week by a score of 15–7, Cooper's team defeated Southern Miss by a score of 20–14. The Rebels then lost a 35-21 contest to #3 Alabama in Jackson, Mississippi. They were shut out by Georgia to the tune of 49–0 on October 12. After a 10–7 loss to South Carolina, the Rebels allowed 24 points in consecutive losses; 24–14 to Vanderbilt and 24–0 in the Magnolia Bowl to LSU. Ole Miss then faced Tennessee in a contest played in Memphis, Tennessee, a game the Volunteers won by a score of 29–17. After losing to archrival Mississippi State by a score of 31–13 in the Egg Bowl, the Rebels concluded the disappointing season with a 26–10 victory over Tulane in New Orleans, Louisiana, a game that had been rescheduled from September due to Hurricane Carmen. Ole Miss improved to 6–5 in 1975. They lost to Baylor by a score of 20–10 in the season opener. A 7–0 loss to #8 Texas A&M; and a 14–3 loss to Tulane before the Rebels recorded their first win of the season with a 24–8 rout over Southern Miss on September 27. The next week, Cooper's team traveled to Birmingham, Alabama and lost to #9 Alabama by a score of 32–6. They got their second win of the season on October 11 with a 28–13 win over Georgia. After a 35–29 loss to South Carolina in Jackson, Mississippi, the Rebels won their final four games to finish the season; topping Vanderbilt (17-7), LSU (17-13), Tennessee (23-6) and Mississippi State (13-7). The Rebels posted another 6–5 record in 1976. They started the season on a sour note, losing to Memphis by a score of 21–16. Ole Miss rebounded to win their next three; defeating #6 Alabama 10–7, Tulane 34-7 and Southern Miss in a 28–0 shutout. Cooper's squad was involved in another shutout the following week, this time losing to Auburn by a score of 10–0. Ole Miss then upset #4 Georgia by a count of 21–17 on October 9. After a 10–7 loss to South Carolina, the Rebels defeated Vanderbilt by a count of 20–3 on October 23. Ole Miss finished the season on a three-game losing streak, beginning with a 45-0 shellacking shutout at the hands of rival LSU in the Magnolia Bowl. On November 13, the Rebels lost to Tennessee by a score of 32–6. They concluded the season on November 20 with a 28–11 loss to their in-state archrivals, Mississippi State, in Jackson, Mississippi. Cooper led the Rebels to a third straight 6–5 mark in 1977. They avenged their previous season's loss to Memphis by defeating the Tigers by a score of 7–3 on September 3. Ole Miss lost to #6 Alabama in Birmingham, Alabama by a count of 34–13. In one of the most memorable games in Rebel football history, Ole Miss upset Notre Dame, 20–13 in Mississippi Memorial Stadium on September 17 in Jackson, Mississippi. That loss was the Irish's lone setback of the 1977 campaign, as Notre Dame finished the season with an 11–1 record and claimed both the AP and UPI national titles. The celebration would quickly fade, as the Rebels lost their next three, beginning with a 27–19 loss to Southern Miss. On October 1, Cooper's team lost to Auburn 21-15 and on October 8 they were edged by Georgia 14–13. Ole Miss then recorded a 17–10 win over South Carolina and a 26–14 victory over Vanderbilt. On October 29, the Rebels lost the Magnolia Bowl to LSU by a score of 28-21 after leading the Tigers 21–0 in the second quarter. The next week, Ole Miss thrashed Tennessee by a score of 43–14. The always-heated Egg Bowl capped the season, with the Rebels losing to Mississippi State 18–14. =Steve Sloan era (1978–1982)= Following the 1977 season, Steve Sloan, the former All-American quarterback at Alabama under Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant, was hired as the new Rebel boss and began his five-year stint in 1978. Sloan arrived in Oxford with head coaching stints at both Vanderbilt and Texas Tech. Sloan posted a 20–34 record from 1978 to 1982. Ole Miss finished 5–6 in 1978.

Mississippi finished the season with consecutive losses; a 30–17 defeat to Tennessee and a 27-10 Egg Bowl contest to Mississippi State. In December 1982, Sloan decided to leave Ole Miss to become the head football coach at Duke. =Billy Brewer era (1983–1994)= After stepping outside the Ole Miss family football tree the previous nine seasons, Ole Miss looked for a familiar face to lead the football program, and the Rebels found that person when Billy Brewer returned to Oxford to take over as head coach in December 1982. In his first season, Brewer guided the Rebels to their first winning regular season since 1977 with a 7–4 mark (they were subsequently awarded a win over Tulane by forfeit a year later). The Rebels also received their first bowl game invitation since 1971 and met Air Force in the Independence Bowl played in Shreveport, Louisiana. Ole Miss dropped a 9–3 decision to the Falcons and finished with a 7–5 record. During his 11-year tenure, Brewer led the Rebels to six winning seasons and five bowls, including Ole Miss' 1991 New Year's Day Gator Bowl appearance. The Jan 1 bowl game was the program's first since 1969. Brewer was named SEC Coach of the Year in 1986 (8–3–1 record), which saw the Rebels return to the national rankings for the first time in over a decade and tie for second in the SEC—their highest finish in 11 years. They just missed out on an SEC championship due to a 22–10 loss to Tennessee the second to last game of the season. The next year, the Rebels returned nine starters on both sides of the ball. However, they flopped to a 3–8 record, a severely disappointing mark even considering that they were hobbled by NCAA sanctions for recruiting violations. They were outscored 127–47 in the season's final three games. Following a 35–6 loss to a mediocre Kentucky team that put that year's team at 1–5, an anonymous group of students under the name Students Against Billy Brewer even took out an ad in the university student newspaper calling for Brewer's firing. The 1988 team, with little expected by most people, defeated Alabama in Tuscaloosa on their homecoming for the first time in history, came from behind to win two more games and looked to be in excellent position to secure a winning season and bowl berth. But the Rebels fell to Tulane in a devastating 14–9 upset on homecoming and also suffered a very heartbreaking loss to a 5–6 Tennessee team at home before rallying to trounce Mississippi State 33–6 in a severe thunderstorm in Jackson. Ole Miss would go 8–4 in 1989, and in the aforementioned 1990 season would notch nine wins and again narrowly miss an SEC title due to a loss to Tennessee. They also made their first appearance in a final media poll since 1971. However, none of the nine wins came against a team with a winning record. Brewer garnered SEC Coach of the Year honors that season. In 1992, Ole Miss posted yet another nine-win season and finished with a national top 15 ranking. But the next year and what turned out to be Brewer's last, Ole Miss would become the first team ever in college football to finish with a losing record (a forfeit from Alabama years later gave the team an in-the-books winning season) despite having the nation's number one team in total defense. In his 11 seasons, Brewer led Ole Miss to eight Egg Bowl victories over in-state rival Mississippi State. At Ole Miss, Brewer compiled a 67–56–3 record, placing him second on Ole Miss' all-time wins list behind Vaught. However, Brewer's tenure at Ole Miss was marred by allegations of recruiting improprieties that twice led to run-ins with the NCAA. The Rebels were banned from post-season play and live television for the 1987 season after a two-year investigation found that Ole Miss recruits had received cash and other gifts from boosters. The penalties were a source of embarrassment for Dr. Gerald Turner, then Ole Miss' chancellor and previously the head of the NCAA's President's Commission, and one of the first milestones in Turner's stormy relationship with Brewer. \\"We have made some mistakes,\\" Brewer said at a news conference following the announcement of the sanctions. \\"We are being punished for those mistakes, and we do not intend ever to be in this situation again.\\" However, in December 1993, Brewer and Ole Miss were again hit by allegations of recruiting violations. The NCAA would eventually cite the program for 15 transgressions, all of them serious and some of them embarrassingly lurid. An NCAA report said that Ole Miss boosters and coaches had offered recruits gifts, including cash and, in one case, a car. Boosters were also accused of breaking national rules by taking recruits 30 miles outside of Oxford, sometimes to strip clubs in Memphis. Most damningly, the NCAA alleged that Ole Miss officials knowingly allowed the violations to occur, demonstrating a lack of institutional control of the football program. The charges forced athletic director Warner Alford to resign in July 1994. One day later, Turner fired Brewer, granting him 30 days' paid leave but no other severance package for the three years remaining on his contract. Later that year, the NCAA, when announcing severe penalties against the Ole Miss football program, found Brewer guilty of unethical conduct. Specifically, it stated \\"There was unethical conduct by a former (Ole Miss) head football coach (Brewer), who was found to show a continuing pattern of disregard for NCAA rules in the operation of the football program ((Jackson, MS) Clarion Ledger, November 18, 1994, p.6-7C).\\" Brewer sued the University for his dismissal, eventually receiving several hundred thousand dollars. =Tommy Tuberville era (1995–1998)= Coach Tuberville On December 2, 1994, Texas A&M; defensive coordinator Tommy Tuberville was selected as the next Rebels head coach. Tuberville was one of the nation's premier assistant coaches who had professional and recruiting ties to both Florida and Arkansas. Despite no prior head coaching experience, Tuberville began creating excitement in his first season in 1995, finishing the campaign with a 6–5 record. The Rebels began the season on September 2 with a 46-13 blowout loss to #6 Auburn. They earned their first victory of the campaign in the season's second game in the form of a 56–10 win over I-AA foe Indiana State.http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/ole/graphics/oldstats/1995-football- stats.pdf After an 18–10 victory over Georgia, Mississippi lost to #3 Florida by a score of 28–10. After a 20–17 victory over Tulane, the Rebels lost to Arkansas in Memphis, Tennessee by a margin of 13–6. On October 21, Tuberville's squad lost to #21 Alabama by a score of 23–9. Ole Miss then won its next two; defeating Vanderbilt by a score of 21-10 and Memphis by a margin of 34–3. After a 38-9 blowout loss to LSU, Mississippi defeated Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl by a score of 13–10. The following season, Tuberville led the Rebels to a 5–6 record. Ole Miss kicked the season off with a 38–14 victory over I-AA opponent Idaho State. Tuberville's team defeated another I-AA foe the following week; a 31-7 drubbing of VMI. In the third game, the Rebels lost to SEC West foe #15 Auburn by a margin of 45–28. After a 20–9 victory over cross-division rival Vanderbilt, Mississippi got dominated by Tennessee in Memphis, Tennessee by a whopping 41–3. After a 37–0 shutout loss to #7 Alabama,http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/ole/graphics/oldstats/1996-football- stats.pdf Ole Miss defeated Arkansas State by a score of 38–21. After a 13–7 loss to rival Arkansas, Mississippi lost the Magnolia Bowl to rival #17 LSU by a score of 39–7. After a 31–27 victory over Georgia, Ole Miss lost the Egg Bowl to archrival Mississippi State in a 17–0 shutout. That excitement grew in 1997, when Ole Miss recorded its best season since 1992 with an 8–4 record. They began the season with a 24–23 overtime nail biting victory over UCF. In the season's second game, Tuberville led the Rebels to a 23–15 victory over SMU. After a 19–9 loss to #16 Auburn, Ole Miss picked up its third win of the season in the form of a 15–3 victory over Vanderbilt. On October 4, Mississippi lost to #9 Tennessee by a margin of 31–17. The next week, Tuberville's team upset #8 LSU by a score of 36–21. After a 29–20 loss to Alabama, Mississippi defeated Arkansas by a margin of 19-9 and Tulane by a score of 41–24. After a 21–14 loss to #14 Georgia, the Rebels won a thrilling Egg Bowl over #22 Mississippi State by a score of 15–14. Ole Miss concluded the season with a 34–31 win in the 1997 Motor City Bowl over Marshall The bowl appearance was the program's first since 1992, and the Rebels earned a final national ranking of #22 in both polls. Ole Miss went 7–5 in 1998. They began the season on September 5, defeating Memphis by a score of 30–10.http://www.olemisssports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/090898aaa.html After a 17–0 shutout loss to Auburn,http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/1998-1999/teamstat.html the Rebels won three straight, defeating Vanderbilt by a score of 30–6,http://www.olemisssports.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/091998aaa.html SMU by a margin of 48–41 in overtime after trailing by 22 in the game's third quarter,http://www.djournal.com/oxford/eedition/page-a/page_6bf9a7fa- de7f-50b4-8f3a-15b9280ef2df.html and South Carolina by a score of 30–28.http://www.olemisssports.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/100398aaa.html After a 20–17 loss to Alabama, Mississippi defeated Arkansas State by a margin of 30-17http://www.olemisssports.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/102498aac.html and LSU by a score of 37–31 in overtime.http://www.olemisssports.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/110198aaa.html Tuberville's team lost its last three games of the regular season, beginning with a 34–0 shutout at the hands of #11 Arkansas.http://www.olemisssports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/103199aaa.html On November 21, the Rebels lost to #14 Georgia by a score of 24–17. Tuberville's Rebels lost the Egg Bowl to #25 Mississippi State by a margin of 28–6. Tuberville, who had accepted the head coaching position at Auburn, did not coach the Rebels in the 1998 Independence Bowl, a game Ole Miss won over Texas Tech by a score of 35–18.http://www.olemisssports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/090117aaa.html Tuberville was named the SEC Coach of the Year in 1997 by the AP. During his tenure, he acquired the nickname \\"The Riverboat Gambler\\" for his aggressive play calling, particularly on fourth down. While at Ole Miss, Tuberville made the statement, \\"They’ll have to carry me out of here in a pine box,\\" in reference to not leaving to coach at another school. Two days after he made that statement, it was announced that he was departing for Auburn. =David Cutcliffe era (1999–2004)= Eli Manning played quarterback for Ole Miss from 2000–2003 Tennessee offensive coordinator David Cutcliffe took over as the Rebels head coach on December 2, 1998. Cutcliffe, who coached star quarterback Peyton Manning at Tennessee and helped the Volunteers win the 1998 national championship,http://www.olemisssports.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/cutcliffe_david00.html brought with him to Oxford a high-powered offensive style that had been successful at Tennessee and energized the Rebel fanbase. During Cutcliffe's tenure, the Rebels played in six bowl games, tied with Arkansas for the most bowl appearances among SEC Western Division schools during that span. Cutcliffe had four winning seasons in his first five seasons at Ole Miss, in 1999 (8–4), 2000 (7–5), 2001 (7–4) and 2002 (7–6), becoming the first Rebel mentor since Harry Mehre (1938–41) to post winning marks in his first five years. Cutcliffe also directed Ole Miss to four bowl appearances in his first five seasons. In 2003 Cutcliffe guided the Rebels to a 10–3 overall mark and a share of the SEC West title with eventual BCS National Champion LSU. Following their 31–28 victory over Oklahoma State in the Cotton Bowl, the Rebels finished #13 in the final poll. It was Ole Miss' first New Year's bowl since the 1991 Gator Bowl against Michigan. The most notable player during the Cutcliffe era was undoubtedly quarterback Eli Manning, son of Rebels legend Archie Manning. During his years with Ole Miss, Manning set or tied 45 single- game, season, and career records. His career numbers include 10,119 passing yards (fifth on the SEC career list), 81 touchdown passes (third on the SEC career list), and a passer rating of 137.7 (tied for sixth on the SEC career list). He led the Rebels to a 10–3 record and a 31–28 SBC Cotton Bowl Classic victory over Oklahoma State in 2003 and then was selected with the top overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft. As his senior year came to a close, Manning won many awards including the Maxwell Award as the nation's best all-around player, the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame Scholar-Athlete Award, the Sporting News Radio Socrates Award, and the SEC Most Valuable Player Award. He was also a candidate for the Heisman Trophy, finishing third in the final voting. Despite his 44–29 record, five straight winning seasons, and guiding the team to its first 10 win season in over 30 years, Cutcliffe was fired by Ole Miss's Athletic Director Pete Boone in December 2004 after the team posted a disappointing 4–7 record and three consecutive losses to LSU. =Ed Orgeron era (2005–2007)= Coach Orgeron Ed Orgeron, regarded as one of college football's premier defensive line coaches and recruiters, was named the 35th head football coach in the history of the University of Mississippi on December 16, 2004. Orgeron took control of the Ole Miss program after serving the previous seven seasons as defensive line coach at the University of Southern California, and played a role in Pete Carroll's USC championship in 2004. Entering the 2005 season, Orgeron had hoped to bring a USC-style offense to the Southeastern Conference (SEC), but found limited success. The University of Mississippi's offense finished the season ranked 111th out of 117 Division I-A schools, in total offense; 115th in scoring; and, 116th in rushing. Though Orgeron's defensive experience, along with returning linebacker Patrick Willis, helped the Rebel defense in 2005, the offense always seemed to produce more interceptions than touchdowns. As a result, the 2005 team struggled and finished the season with a record of three wins and eight losses—the Rebels' worst record since 1987. In response to the results of his first season, Orgeron fired offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone, replacing him with former Miami offensive coordinator Dan Werner. Also, Orgeron hired Art Kehoe, the longtime offensive line coach at Miami; both assistants had just been fired by the Miami. In 2006, Ole' Miss finished the season ranked #108 in scoring offense, #111 in total offense, and #112 in passing offense. Orgeron's second recruiting class in February 2006 was successful, acquiring the written pledges of a national Top 15 signing class. He followed that with the 32nd ranked recruiting class in February 2007. At Ole Miss, Orgeron recorded only two wins against teams with winning records (the 2005 and 2007 Memphis teams, which both finished at 7–5)—the fewest among active SEC coaches at the time. Until the 2007 season, he enjoyed the public support of the University of Mississippi's chancellor Robert Khayat and other administrators with oversight of the football program, including athletic director Pete Boone. In a November 2006 article in The Clarion-Ledger, Khayat said of Orgeron and the poor win/loss record since he was hired (7–14, at the time of the interview), \\"I think Coach Orgeron inherited a very difficult situation....I am 100 percent behind him, and I think that people ought to understand that he has a big challenge.\\" In 2007, Ole Miss finished the season 0–8 against fellow SEC teams, and 3–9 overall. It was the program's first winless (conference) season since 1982. On November 24, 2007, after Ole Miss blew a 14-point fourth-quarter lead to in-state rival Mississippi State in the season finale, Orgeron was fired. =Houston Nutt era (2008–2011)= Coach Nutt On November 28, 2007, just five weeks after having defeated Ole Miss as the head coach at Arkansas, Houston Nutt was officially introduced as the new Ole Miss head football coach at a press conference at the Gertrude Castellow Ford Center for Performing Arts on the Ole Miss campus. During the press conference, Nutt stated, \\"One thing I love about Ole Miss is the tradition,\\" naming past players such as Archie Manning, Jake Gibbs, Frank \\"Bruiser\\" Kinard, Deuce McAllister and Eli Manning. \\"It's about tradition. That's the reason I am here. I feel like this place can be successful. I feel like this place can win. I can't wait to tell our players this afternoon. That's how you spell fun. The way you spell fun is \\"W-I-N.\\" That's what it is all about.\\" Nutt's hiring made him the 36th head football coach at Ole Miss. After a 41–24 victory over border rival Memphis to open the season, the Rebels suffered a loss to the then-ranked Wake Forest Demon Deacons, 30–28, on a last-second field goal. After defeating Samford, Ole Miss lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores at home. After the loss, the Rebels traveled to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville, Florida, where they defeated the #4-ranked, and eventual national champion, Florida Gators, 31–30, after blocking Florida's attempt at a tying extra point and a defensive stop of Florida quarterback Tim Tebow on 4th-and-1. The next weekend, the Rebels lost to South Carolina. Next on the schedule was Alabama, ranked No. 2 in the nation at the time. During the game, Ole Miss became the first team Alabama trailed in the 2008 season. Alabama ultimately prevailed, however, in the final series of the game, winning, 24–20. Then came Arkansas. Nutt, facing his old team, came out victorious, 23–21. The Rebels followed that with a 17–7 home win against Auburn. On November 15, Ole Miss beat ULM, 59–0, to push their record to 6–4 and become bowl eligible for the first time since 2003. Ole Miss next beat No. 8 LSU, 31–13, in Baton Rouge, snapping a six-game losing streak to the Tigers, earning the Rebels an Associated Press ranking of No. 25, the first time in four years Ole Miss had been ranked. The Rebels went on to beat SEC West and in-state rival Mississippi State, 45–0, in the Egg Bowl to finish the regular season at 8–4. The win over the Bulldogs moved the Rebels up to No. 22 in the AP Poll and landed the team their first ranking of the year in the Coaches' Poll, coming in at No. 25. Ole Miss defeated No. 7 Texas Tech, 47–34, in the Cotton Bowl Classic. The Ole Miss Rebels began the 2009 season ranked high and with high expectations. After beating Memphis, 45–14, and Southeastern Louisiana, 52–6, which gave Ole Miss the second longest winning streak in the nation at eight games dating back to the 2008 season, Ole Miss climbed as high as No. 4 in the AP Poll before losing their 2009 SEC opener, 16–10, on the road at South Carolina in a Thursday night game on September 24. After the loss, Ole Miss fell 17 spots in the AP Poll, down to No. 21. Ole Miss went on the road again and beat Vanderbilt the next week, 23–7. After a disappointing start and pair of conference losses, they managed to rebound against Arkansas, winning 30–17. Ole Miss went on to beat No. 8 LSU, 25–23, at Oxford. Ole Miss lost to in-state and SEC rival Mississippi State on November 28 in the Egg Bowl at Starkville, 41–27. Ole Miss was picked to play in the Cotton Bowl Classic for the second year in a row, where they defeated Oklahoma State, 21–7, to end the season. Nutt's Rebels finished 4–8 overall in the 2010 season, including 1–7 in the SEC. Among the worst of these losses was to FCS- member Jacksonville State, which was Ole Miss' first loss to a lower division team since 1945. Adding insult to injury, Nutt suffered his first loss to his former team, as Arkansas defeated Ole Miss 38–24. The crowd at Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville mockingly chanted Nutt's name after the game was over. Nutt was the center of a major recruiting controversy in February 2010. After recruiting 37 players, the SEC was forced to enact the 'Houston Nutt Rule,' beginning August 1, 2010. The rule stated that \\"SEC teams will be limited to signing 28 football recruits, with the usual maximum of 25 allowed to enroll in the fall.\\"SEC teams adjust to 'Houston Nutt rule'  AL.com. Blog.al.com. Retrieved on July 19, 2015. It was announced on April 16, 2009 that Nutt and his wife Diana had committed to give a gift of $100,000 to Ole Miss. Half of the contribution will create scholarships for student-athletes. The other half of the gift will be used toward the university's Indoor Practice Facility, which opened in 2004 and cost $17 million to build. Nutt was fired as head coach after a dismal 2–10 2011 season, ending a disappointing tenure that had begun with much optimism. =Hugh Freeze era (2012–2016)= Coach Freeze On December 5, 2011, Hugh Freeze was announced as the 37th head coach of the Ole Miss Rebels football team. An Oxford native, Freeze was previously the head coach at Arkansas State for one season and had previously been the tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator under Houston Nutt from 2005–2007 and had even interviewed with Nutt for the Rebels offensive coordinator job. In 2012 Ole Miss went 7–6 and finished the regular season with a win over rival Mississippi State. The Rebels won their bowl game against Pitt in the BBVA Compass Bowl. In Freeze's second year, the Rebels went 8–5 (3–5 in the SEC). The 2013 Rebels defeated then-sixth-ranked LSU on a last-second field goal in Oxford and capped off the season with a 25–17 victory over Georgia Tech in the Music City Bowl. In 2014, Freeze led Ole Miss to one of its strongest seasons in four decades. The Rebels spent most of the season in the top 10, rising as high as third in October—their highest ranking at that late stage in the season in almost half a century. They defeated Alabama at home that October and ultimately finished 9–3, only the third time since Vaught's tenure that a Rebel team has won as many as nine games. This garnered them a berth in the 2014 Peach Bowl against TCU—their first major-bowl appearance since 1969. However, TCU crushed the Rebels by a score of 42–3. Freeze led to the Rebels to another strong season in 2015, one that featured wins over ranked rivals LSU and Mississippi State, but was headlined by a road victory over then-no.2 Alabama, their first win in Tuscaloosa since 1988 and only the first time they had beaten the Tide in back to back seasons. Ole Miss controlled their own destiny in the SEC West for much of the 2015 campaign, but ultimately finished in second. The Rebels earned a trip to the 2016 Sugar Bowl, their first appearance in this bowl game since 1970, where they beat Oklahoma State 48–20. In 2016, the Rebels struggled to a 5–7 record. After beginning the season at No.11, the Rebels blew a 22-point lead en route to a loss the opening weekend to Florida State. After defeating Wofford the following week, the Rebels blew another three-touchdown lead in a loss to Alabama. After obliterating Georgia and Memphis, the Rebels lost three straight to Arkansas, LSU and Auburn. After defeating Georgia Southern and upsetting then-No. 10 Texas A&M;, the Rebels dropped their last two regular season games to Vanderbilt and Mississippi State. On February 22, 2017, Ole Miss announced it would self-impose a bowl ban for the upcoming season after the NCAA accused the program of numerous violations of organization rules, including a lack of institutional control. Freeze was charged with failure to monitor and not promoting an atmosphere of compliance. On July 20, 2017, Freeze resigned after Ole Miss officials learned that he had used a university-provided cell phone to place calls to an escort service in \\"a concerning pattern\\" that began shortly after he took the job in 2011. =Matt Luke era (2017–present)= Co-offensive coordinator/offensive line coach Matt Luke was named interim head coach after Freeze's resignation. Luke had extensive ties to Ole Miss. After a four-year playing career at center from 1995–1998 and graduating from Ole Miss in 2000 with a Bachelor of Business Administration, he took a job with Murray State University as an offensive line coach. Following the 2001 season, he returned to Ole Miss to coach offensive line and tight ends under head coach David Cutcliffe. Ole Miss fired Cutcliffe after the 2004 season, but new head coach Ed Orgeron retained Luke as part of his staff. Luke departed Ole Miss in 2006 to be reunited with Cutcliffe at the University of Tennessee, where the latter was the assistant head coach/offensive coordinator. After Cutcliffe took the Duke head coaching job in December 2007, Luke was hired as the team's offensive coordinator/offensive line coach, serving in that capacity until returning to his alma mater to join Hugh Freeze's staff in 2012. The Rebels finished 6–6 in 2017. The started the season with a 47–27 rout of South Alabama. After a 45–23 victory over FCS opponent Tennessee-Martin, Ole Miss suffered its first loss of the season in a 27–16 defeat at the hands of California, the first time the Rebels faced a Pac-12 Conference team in football in program history. On September 30, the Rebels were obliterated by #1 Alabama in a 66-3 crushing. After a 44–23 loss to #12 Auburn, Ole Miss defeated Vanderbilt by a margin of 57–35. After a 40–24 loss to #24 LSU and a heartbreaking 38–37 loss to Arkansas, Ole Miss beat Kentucky in a 37-34 thriller and Louisiana-Lafayette by a margin of 50–22. After a 31–24 loss to Texas A&M;, the Rebels closed the season with a 31-28 Egg Bowl upset victory over archrival #16 Mississippi State. On November 27, 2017, one day after the thrilling upset over Mississippi State, it was announced that the interim tag would be removed from Matt Luke and that he would be the team's permanent head coach.

The game was announced in January 2018 and was released on September 25, 2019 on Apple App Store and Google Play. This game features biweekly, downloadable themed tours with different cups, each of which has three courses and a bonus challenge. In addition to courses which already appeared in the Mario Kart series, Mario Kart Tour includes courses located in cities in the real world (e.g. New York, Tokyo, Paris, London, Vancouver, Los Angeles). Gameplay In-game screenshot of Mario racing alongside Toadette in Mario Circuit 1 from Super Mario Kart The game deviates from the traditional gameplay of the Mario Kart series, where the objective is to reach the finish line in first; this game utilizes a point-based system. There are four options of speed: 50cc (namely \\"leisurely\\"), 100cc (\\"fast\\"), 150cc (\\"very fast\\") and 200cc (\\"too fast\\"). Unlike previous installments in the series, much of the driving (notably acceleration, jump boosts) is performed automatically. Mario Kart Tour includes features from previous Mario Kart games, such as underwater racing and hang gliding from Mario Kart 7. This game introduces a new Frenzy mode, which occurs when a driver gets three identical items from an item box. Each character can get a unique item (also known as \\"Special Skill\\") from item boxes. Mario Kart Tour introduces a new format called \\"Tours\\". Tours are named after cities in the real world, Mario series characters, Mario series games, or other themes (such as cuisine and holidays). Each tour lasts for two weeks, beginning on Wednesday at 6 a.m. UTC. In a tour, players can compete in twelve to eighteen cups and collect drivers, karts and gliders which represent the corresponding cities or themes. There are also spotlight drivers, karts, and gliders while a tour lasts for two weeks. Each Cup consists of three courses and a bonus challenge. Courses from previous cups may be reused for subsequent cups. Most races have two laps, while most bonus challenges are done in one lap. The cups are also named after some of the drivers in the game instead of the usual items in the Mario franchise. After the player finishes a race, the player is awarded with Grand Stars to unlock tour gifts, experience points for the used character, kart, and glider and coins. If the player finishes in the top three, they will earn some player points for their level. If the player finishes in 5th place or below, the level-gauge will decrease. When the player fills the gauge all the way, they will level-up to get a reward. Each course also has an experience point limit. Currently, the max player-level is 150. Each day the player can gain up to 450 experience points for each character, kart, and glider and 300 coins from racing (900 experience points and 600 coins if the player is subscribed to the Gold Pass). Once those limits are reached, the player cannot get any more experience points for the characters, karts, and gliders, or collect any more coins from racing daily until the next morning at 6:00 UTC. To continue earning more experience points or collecting coins, the player can play Coin Rush to get more coins or use point-boost tickets for the characters, karts, and gliders. On the bonus challenge for each cup, the player must do the requirement to complete the cup. The character shown on the picture of the bonus challenge is always selected, even if the player does not have them yet. Completing a bonus challenge awards three Grand Stars instead of five. Some challenges also allow the player to choose any character, kart, and glider. Each week, a tour's cup is a tournament. 20 players are placed on a leaderboard based on the overall score for the cup. By the following Wednesday, Lakitu announces how well the player did. The player will increase in tier, and earn some rewards if their end position is near the top, but they will lose one or two tiers if they finish poorly. The player also gets a reward if the player and their friends' score reaches a certain amount. This game includes races against AI-controlled opponents with usernames designed to make players think they are playing against other human players. In addition, a beta test for the multiplayer function of this game began from \\"approximately 11:00 PM PT on December 18, 2019 to 9:59 PM PT on December 26, 2019\\" and was only available for subscribers to the Gold Pass. From January 22, 2020 to January 28, 2020, there was a multiplayer test for all players of the game. At 8 PM PT on March 8, 2020, multiplayer function in Mario Kart Tour was officially launched. All players \\"can race against up to seven other players, whether they're registered as in-game friends, nearby to your location, or even scattered around the world.\\" In the meantime, \\"Gold Races are available exclusively to subscribers of the Mario Kart Tour Gold Pass.\\" One of the main differences between the Standard Races (for players without the Gold Pass) and the Gold Races is the selection of speed: only 100cc is available in the Standard Races while 150cc and 200cc are available in the Gold Races. There is a multiplayer rank (ranging from F to A, S to S+6 if subscribed to the Gold Pass) for each player. A percentage for the rank will increase when a player wins in a multiplayer race, but will decrease or remain unchanged during a loss. The game originally could only be played in portrait mode, however on July 21, 2020, the game received an update that allowed the players to play the game in landscape mode too. Development In January 2018, Nintendo announced a mobile version of the Mario Kart series for iOS and Android. Nintendo announced in April 2019 that they would be holding a closed beta for the game, exclusively for Android users, which took place from late May to early June. Initially expected to be released by March 2019, the game was released on September 25, 2019. As of September 26, a day after Mario Kart Tour release, there had been over ten million downloads of the game. To celebrate the Super Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary, the game was updated to include two new characters: SNES Mario and Donkey Kong Jr., who had not appeared in the series since Super Mario Kart.  Reception  On its first day, Mario Kart Tour was available for download in 58 markets, including the Japanese and American markets. Revenue-wise, it placed #19 for iPhone apps in the United States. This was a significant debut improvement compared to Dr. Mario World, a match- three mobile game also developed by Nintendo and released on July 9, 2019, which placed #503 during its debut. Another game published by Nintendo on February 2, 2019, Fire Emblem Heroes, placed #17 on the top iPhone revenue app during its debut. Mario Kart Tour received 90.1 million downloads in its first week of availability according to Sensor Tower, the highest number of first- week downloads for a Nintendo mobile game, surpassing Animal Crossing: Pocket Camps 14.3 million downloads. It also made $12.7 million in first-week player spending, the 3rd-highest for a Nintendo mobile game behind Fire Emblem Heroes ($28.2 million) and Super Mario Run ($16.1 million). Total downloads reached 123.9 million in the first month of release, generating $37.4 million in player spending. The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to review aggregator Metacritic. While critics praised the graphics and simple controls, they criticized Mario Kart Tours gacha element, as well as its monthly $4.99 Gold Pass feature, which is required to use the game's 200cc feature, to get more items, and in-game achievements, the constant need for a stable internet connection, and the only way to unlock things like karts and gold badges in the game requires money. Many journalists noted that the monthly charge for the subscription service was the same as that of Apple Arcade, which launched a few days prior to the release of Mario Kart Tour, claiming that the former provides subscribers with more content for the same price and is thus more worth purchasing. The game was also criticized for player selection multiplayer functionality and not having characters at launch like Luigi who had been available in trailers, tutorials and the beta testing stage of the game. =Accolades= The game won the award for \\"Racing Game of the Year\\" at the 23rd Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, and was nominated for \\"Favorite Video Game\\" at the 2020 Kids' Choice Awards.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to sixty small, densely crowded, reddish and green flowers and grows in coastal heath. Description Genoplesium confertum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long, about wide and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between ten and sixty flowers are densely crowded along a flowering stem tall and slightly taller than the leaf. The flowers lean forwards, are reddish with green tips, long and about wide. The flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is pinkish red, broadly egg-shaped, about long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, wide, spread apart from each other and have a small whitish gland on their tip. The petals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, blackish red, about long and wide with a prominent gland on their tips. The labellum is dark red, egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, about long, wide, with small teeth on the sides. There is a thick, fleshy callus in the centre of the labellum, covering about half of its surface and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs between February and May. Taxonomy and naming Genoplesium confertum was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near the road to Rainbow Beach in the Great Sandy National Park and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis conferta. The specific epithet (conferta) is a Latin word meaning \\"crowded\\", referring to the crowded flowers in this species. Distribution and habitat Genoplesium confertum grows in heath on stabilised sand dunes in coastal districts between Fraser Island and Runaway Bay, including the Great Sandy National Park.

Early years and education Florence Trumbull Carpenter was born in New York City, March 10, 1854. She was a daughter of the artist, Francis Bicknell Carpenter. Her father's position in the literary and artistic world and her own beauty made her one of the favorites of the intellectual circles of New York City. Career On May 12, 1877, soon after her graduation from Rutgers Female College, she married Albert Chester Ives, a journalist of New York, at that time stationed in London, England, where their home for several years was one of the centers of attraction for Americans and Englishmen. They lived for several years in a like manner in Paris, France, and also spent time in Dresden and Dublin. Their son, Emerson Ives, was born in 1882, during a year spent in the United States. In 1887, after her return to New York City, Ives made her first attempts in newspaper work. Her first position was as a general worker on the Press, where she performed various tasks, including art criticism, society news, fashions, gossip, and articles about women. Her work finally settled into that of literary editor, which place she held as long as her connection with the paper lasted. In 1891, she widened her field of work so as to include many of the leading New York papers, her articles on topics of important and permanent interest appearing in the Sun, the Tribune, the World, the Herald and other journals. She became editor of the woman's department of the Metropolitan and Rural Home. With the opening of executive work for the World's Columbian Exposition, she was put in charge of all the press work sent out by the general board of lady managers to the New York papers. A few months later, she received an appointment by the World's Fair board of managers of the State of New York as chief executive clerk of the woman's board of that State. That position required her to move to Albany and her temporary withdrawal from active newspaper work in New York, although she retained certain of her connections with the press. She died December 20, 1900, at Quaker Hill, Dutchess County, New York. Interment was in Homer, New York.

Only a small section of the structure is now visible, below ground level, to the north of Piazza Stesicoro. This area is now the historic centre of the city, but was then on the outskirts of the ancient town and also occupied by the . The structure is part of the .  Description  Reconstructed relief plan, with the current street plan superimposed, 1907. The amphitheatre of Catania is the most complicated and largest of all the amphitheatres in Sicily. It is one of a group of large arenas, which also includes the Colosseum, the Amphitheatre of Capua, and the Verona Arena. The structure centred on an elliptical arena, surrounded by radial walls and vaults supporting the seating of the cavea, which had 14 steps and 32 aisles. A gallery ran around the outside of the structure, on which the external facade is mounted. The arena had a maximum diameter of 70 metres and a minor diameter of around 50 metres, with a circumference of 192 metres. The external diameter was 125 x 105 metres, while the external circumference was 309 metres. Opus vittatum was used for the construction of the interior and opus quadratum for the exterior. The remains of the pilasters are in opus quadratum with small blocks of igneous rock. The cavea was made of basalt from Mount Etna, faced with marble. The external walls indicate a degree of carelessness in construction. The blocks are cut irregularly and seem to mostly have been recycled. The external arches are made with large rectangular bricks of regular shape and good quality mortar, while the internal ones are made of concrete, with large radial plates. Despite the overall sobriety of the building, the contrast between the colour of the very dark igneous rock of the walls and the red bricks of the arches must have been very striking. A note of class was added by the employment of marble, not only for the cladding of the podium, but also for some decorations, such as the herms on the sides of the main entrance. The main stairs were probably made of limestone, creating a strong interplay with the white of the seating and the black of the other stairways. A cover with large awnings to protect people from strong sun and rain probably existed. From the theatre's dimensions it can be calculated to have held 15,000 spectators and almost double that number with the addition of wooden bleachers for standing spectators.For the measurements: R. J. Wilson, \\"La topografia della Catania romana. Problemi e prospettive,\\" in Catania antica. Atti del Convegno della SISAC, Pisa-Roma 1996, pp. 165-167. According to an uncertain and unconfirmed tradition, it was intended that naumachiae (staged sea battles) take place in the amphitheatre, using the ancient to fill the arena with water.S. Lagona, \\"L'acquedotto romano di Catania,\\" in Cronache di archeologia e di storia dell'arte, 3, 1964. = Entrance = Entrance of the amphitheatre from the Piazza Stesicoro. The excavated part of the amphitheatre is now accessed by an ironwork gate. In 1906 the gate was decorated with some fragments of marble columns which were originally part of the upper loggia, two fragmentary Ionic columns, and part of an architrave inscribed with AMPHITHEATRVM INSIGNE (\\"Eminent Amphitheatre\\"). The iron gate is at the centre, between the columns which have capitals, which support the architrave. The other two columns are located on either side, with stone walls in between with symbolic epitaphs of two illustrious ancient Greeks linked to this area (Charondas on the left and Stesichorus on the right), which were composed by the poet Mario Rapisardi. Tradition has it that their tombs are actually in the area of the amphitheatre.  History  The monument was probably built in the 2nd century AD. The exact date is uncertain, but the architectural style suggests some time between the Emperors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. It seems clear that it was expanded in the 3rd century AD, tripling the structure's size. A baseless popular legend claims that lava flows from the eruption of Etna in 252 reached the theatre but did not destroy it. This tradition derives from the life of Saint Agatha as reported in the Acta Sanctorum of Jean Bolland, where it is reported that in the specific year of the saint's death (251) lava flowed towards the gates of the city and the farmers, worried for their fields, went to the tomb of the saint, removed her funerary shroud and used it to stop the lava. Although this source is obviously hagiographical, it led vulcanologists like Carlo Gemmellaro to erroneously interpret the amphitheatre (which is near the city gates) as the point where the lava stopped. Recent stratigraphic studies have clearly shown that the rock identified as the 'lava flow of Saint Agatha' of 252 actually came from Monpeloso and flowed through the area of Nicolosi before cooling and solidifying in Mascalucia, about 450 metres above sea level. Thus it moved toward Catania, but never actually reached it. The sole traces of lava near the amphitheatre are a lava ledge which abuts one of the vaulted walls of the building. However, when a core was drilled into the walls of the internal walkway in the twentieth century in order to determine what was behind them, \\"wagonloads\\" of liquid flowed out, clearly indicating that the space behind is empty. The fragment of volcanic rock is very likely fill placed there in order to support the foundations of the facade of the above it. Panoramic view of the inscription installed on the excavated amphitheatreper me civitas catanensium sublimatur a Christo (Through me, the City of Catania is raised up by Christ), a statement attributed to Saint Agatha, who is meant to have been martyred nearby. According to Cassiodorus, in the 5th century, Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, allowed the inhabitants of the city to spoliate the theatre for building material for the construction of stone buildings,Cited in R. Soraci, \\"Catania in età tardoantica,\\" Quaderni catanesi di Cultura classica e medioevale 3, 1991, pp. 269-270 on the grounds that the monument had been abandoned \\"for a long time.\\" According to some authors, Roger II further spoliated the structure in the 11th century for the construction of Catania Cathedral, including the grey granite columns that decorate the cathedral's facade and the apses, in which perfectly cut stones can be seen, which may also have been used in the construction of the Castello Ursino in the Swabian period. In the 13th century, according to tradition, the amphitheatre's vomitoria (entranceways) were used by the Angevins to enter the city during the Sicilian Vespers. In the following century, the entrances were walled up and the ruins were incorporated into the Aragonese fortifications (1302). In 1505, the civic senate granted Giovanni Gioeni a concession to use the monument's stone for the construction of houses and to use the arena itself as a garden. Measures were taken to secure the ruins in the construction of new fortifications in 1550: the first and second stories were knocked down and the galleries were filled in with the rubble. After the 1693 Sicily earthquake, it was finally buried, and the area was turned into a parade ground. Subsequently, the extrados of the galleries were used as the foundations of new houses and for the neo-classical facade of the Church of San Biagio. From the second half of the 18th century, the amphitheatre was the object of archaeological excavation. However the discoveries were not preserved: instead the arches were walled up and reused in the palaces of the reconstructed city. In the early years of the 20th century, renovation work was undertaken in order to open the site to visitors, as part of the construction of the Piazza Stesicoro. In 1943, during the allied bombardment which reduced parts of the city to rubble, the structure was used as a bomb shelter. Subsequently, it experienced periods of interest and abandonment. For several years, the tunnels were kept shut for 'security reasons', following tragic accidents resulting from people exploring. The amphitheatre was renovated in 1997 and opened that summer. Then it was closed due to the influx of sewerage from the neighbouring houses. This was partially fixed and it was reopened to the public in 1999, but then closed a little later as a result of its deterioration. The remains, representing about a tenth of the amphitheatre, are visible from the entrance of the Piazza Stesicoro and from the Vico Anfiteatro, where the structure is visible up to the third floor. Until 2007, it was possible to see part of second story on the Via del Colosseo, but it is now entirely covered by the new terrace of the Villa Cerami. Inside the villa, which is now used by the University of Catania's Faculty of jurisprudence, it is still possible to see part of the vaulting system that linked the Amphitheatre to the Montevergine hill (probably the ancient acropolis of the city). The rest of the amphitheatre is below the Via Neve, Via Manzoni, and Via Penninello. The early modern excavations seem to be the reason for the instability of the structure, which was announced in 2014 to be in danger of collapse in a parliamentary debate and which had already been brought to public attention by CTzen.Bertorotta (M5S): \\"Salviamo l'anfiteatro romano di Catania\\" - YouTube On 24 April 2014, an expert board was established in order to organise the recuperation of the monument and to safeguard the neighbourhood which has developed on top of the structure over the centuries.  Research  The amphitheatre in a photo from 1911 The first modern scholar to discuss the amphitheatre at Catania was Tommaso Fazello, who also established its dimensions. Subsequently, fantastical reconstructions of structure were proposed by authors like Ottavio D'Arcangelo and , which did however include the first surveys of the building. In the 18th century, expended substantial amounts of his own money on excavations, in order to establish beyond doubt that the amphitheatre had actually existed - a point that some visitors had strongly denied. Over a two-year period, he uncovered a whole corridor and four large arches of the external gallery.Ignazio Paternò Castello, Viaggio per tutte le antichità della Sicilia. 2nd edition. Palermo, 1817 pp. 28-29. In the 19th century, these excavations could still be accessed from an entrance on the Via del Colosseo (which was and is popular known as 'Catania Vecchia') and all kinds of legends have become associated with it, such as the tale of a school group which snuck into the structure for a visit and never came out. In 1904, during the administration of Mayor Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida, work began to bring the whole structure to light, under the supervision of the architect . This project ended two years later. At this time, a broad and mysterious landing passage was discovered,See e.g. G. Libertini in note in Adolf Holm, Catania Antica, Catania 1925, p. 39. probably a late extension of the building, which prevented those sat nearest to the arena from seeing the spectacles well and reduced the dimensions of the arena, but allowed a better view for an additional level, probably that added in the course of the 3rd century AD. In 1907, the opening ceremony was held, attended by king Victor Emmanuel III. Already by the Interwar period, the amphitheatre had been allowed to decay once more, to the extent that many of the buildings above were using the seating for sewerage. In recent years, the amphitheatre has also been suddenly closed and reopened. At the end of 2007 and 2008, technical works were undertaken to determine the state of conservation of the external pilasters. On this occasion, it was possible to confirm that the structure had been renovated and expanded in a second phase. A subsequent investigation was then carried out which has been able to produce a virtual reconstruction of the structure.

Copper chlorate is an oxidiser. It commonly crystallizes with four molecules of water. Production Copper chlorate can be made by combining a hot one molar solution of copper sulfate, with barium chlorate, which results in the precipitation of barium sulfate. When the solution is filtered, cooled and evaporated under a vacuum blue crystals form. :CuSO4 \\\\+ Ba(ClO3)2 → Cu(ClO3)2 \\\\+ BaSO4(s) Properties In 1902, A. Meusser investigated solubility of copper chlorate and found that it melted and started decomposing above 73 °C, giving off chlorine. Copper chlorate decomposes when heated, giving off a yellow gas, which contains chlorine, oxygen and chlorine dioxide. A green solid is left that is a basic copper salt. :2 Cu(ClO3)2 → 2 CuO + Cl2 \\\\+ 3 O2 \\\\+ 2 ClO2 Sulfur is highly reactive with copper chlorate, and it is important not to cross contaminate these chemicals, for example in pyrotechnic making.  Structure  Copper(II) chlorate commonly crystallizes as a tetrahydrate, though a hexahydrate is also known. Tetraaquacopper(II) chlorate, Cu(ClO3)2·4H2O, has an orthorhombic crystal structure. Each copper atom is octahedrally coordinated, surrounded by four oxygen atoms of water, and two oxygen atoms from chlorate groups, which are opposite each other. Water is closer to the copper than chlorate, 1.944 Å compared to 2.396 Å, exhibiting the Jahn-Teller effect. The chlorate groups take the shape of a distorted tetrahedron. At , the chlorine-oxygen distances in each chlorate ion are 1.498, 1.488 and 1.468 Å, with the longest being the oxygen next to copper. The ∠O-Cu-O (angle subtended at copper by oxygen atoms) is 105.2°, 108.3°, and 106.8°. At lower temperatures (), the water molecules and copper-chlorate distance shrink. Use François-Marie Chertier used tetraamminecopper(II) chlorate to colour flames blue in 1843. This material was abbreviated TACC with formula Cu(NH3)4(ClO3)2. TACC explodes on impact. The substance became known as Chertier'c copper for use in blue coloured pyrotechnics. However its deliquescence causes a problem. Mixtures with other metal salts can yield violet or lilac colours also. It has also been used to colour copper brown.

He researches the evolution of cognition by studying both humans, our close relatives the primates (especially bonobos and chimpanzees), and species whose cognition converged with our own (primarily domestic dogs). He founded and co- directs the Duke Canine Cognition Center.  Biography  Hare obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology and Psychology from Emory University in 1998. As an undergraduate, he conducted research with Michael Tomasello, where he found that chimpanzees are sensitive to what other chimpanzees can and cannot see, and that domestic dogs can follow humans’ pointing gestures to find food. Hare continued his study of primate and canid cognition at Harvard University, where he was advised by Richard Wrangham. In 2004, he obtained his Ph.D in Biological Anthropology. He joined the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, where he founded the Hominoid Psychology Research Group. He studied great ape cognition in several African sanctuaries, including bonobos at Lola ya Bonobo and chimpanzees at Tchimpounga and Ngamba Island. Since 2008, Hare has been a professor at Duke University. In 2009, he founded the Duke Canine Cognition Center, which has tested the cognitive abilities of pet dogs in the Research Triangle area as well as working dogs from organizations such as Canine Companions for Independence. He has also researched lemur cognition at the Duke Lemur Center.

During Operation Barbarossa, it was subordinated to the SS and deployed in German-occupied areas, specifically the Army Group Centre Rear Area, of the Soviet Union, as part of Police Regiment Centre. Alongside detachments from the Einsatzgruppen and the SS Cavalry Brigade, it perpetrated mass murder in the Holocaust and was responsible for large-scale crimes against humanity targeting civilian populations under the guise of \\"anti-partisan\\" warfare. In mid-1942, the battalion was reassigned to the 4th Police Regiment and operated in Slovenia. Background and formation The German Order Police was a key instrument of the security apparatus of Nazi Germany. In the prewar period, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, and Kurt Daluege, chief of the Order Police, cooperated in transforming the police force of the Weimar Republic into militarised formations ready to serve the regime's aims of conquest and racial annihilation. The police units participated in the annexation of Austria and the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Police troops were first formed into battalion-sized formations for the invasion of Poland, where they were deployed for security and policing purposes, also taking part in executions and mass deportations. Twenty-three Order Police battalions were slated to take part in the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. Nine were attached to security divisions of the Wehrmacht. Two battalions were assigned to support the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile death squads of the SS, and the Organisation Todt, the military construction group. Twelve were formed into regiments, three battalions each, and designated as Police Regiments Centre, North, South, and Special Purpose. The goals of the police battalions were to secure the rear by eliminating the remnants of the enemy forces, guarding the prisoners of war, and protecting the lines of communications and captured industrial facilities. Their instructions also included, as Daluege stated, the \\"combat of criminal elements, above all political elements\\". Along with Police Battalion 307 and 322, Police Battalion 316 was assigned to Police Regiment Centre. Comprising about 550 men, the battalion was raised from recruits mobilised from the 1905–1915 year groups. They were led by career police professionals, steeped in the ideology of Nazism, driven by anti- semitism and anti-Bolshevism. The regiment was placed under the command of , a career policeman. When it crossed the German-Soviet border, the regiment came under the control of Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSS-PF) for Army Group Centre. Operational history Himmler made a personal visit to the headquarters of Police Regiment Centre in Belostok on 8 July where he spoke to Montua, Bach-Zalewski and the regiment's officers. On 10 July, Daluege visited the unit and addressed the members of the regiment arrayed in a parade formation, extolling them to \\"exterminate\\" Bolshevism as a \\"blessing for Germany\\". On 11 July, Montua passed a confidential order from Bach-Zalewski to the battalion commanders that Jews, who had been \\"convicted of looting\\", were to be shot; an execution took place the same day. Around this time, Police Battalions 316 and 322 rounded up approximately 3,000 Jewish men from Belostok and shot them in a nearby forest. On 17 July, the regiment murdered over 1,100 Jews in Slonim, with Bach-Zalewski reporting to Himmler on 18 July: \\"Yesterday's cleansing action in Slonim by Police Regiment Centre. 1,153 Jewish plunderers were shot\\". By 20 July, the unit's reports referred to executions of Jewish women and children. Wehrmacht propaganda photograph of the Jewish women in Mogilev, July 1941. Six thousand Mogilev Jews were murdered by SS forces and Police Battalions 316 and 322 in October 1941. On 2 October 1941, Police Battalions 316 and 322, along with Bach-Zalewski's staff company and Ukrainian auxiliaries, rounded up 2,200 Jews in the Mogilev ghetto. Sixty-five were killed during the roundups, and another 550 executed the next day. Another killing operation later that month, by Einsatzkommando 8 and the two police battalions, brought the total number of victims in Mogilev to about 6,000. On November 7–8, the battalion participated in the murder of Jews in Bobruisk. The inmates of the Bobruisk ghetto were rounded up in the early morning; they were loaded into trucks and taken to the village of Kamenka where they were shot into pits dug for this purpose. About 5,281 people were killed by the personnel of the battalion and the Einsatzkommando 8 and Police Battalion 316. In December, after the German defeat in the Battle of Moscow, the regiment was sent to the front lines to reinforce the German defenses, thus depriving Bach-Zalewski of manpower. The battalion was assigned to guard and security duties to the immediate rear of the front-line troops, but no detailed information is available on its activities during this time. Police Battalion 316 was withdrawn from the front at the end of April 1942 and then returned to Germany in mid- to late May to recuperate where it was based in Bottrop, Buer, and Gelsenkirchen. Several months later, it was transferred to Slovenia where its First Company helped to conduct a brief anti-partisan operation (Bandenbekämpfung, or \\"bandit-fighting\\"), together with Police Battalion 93, in the vicinity of Škofja Loka between 15 and 17 July. That same month it was redesignated as the First Battalion of the 4th Police Regiment.

History The Australian Defence Force acquired 80,000 acres (approximately 32,375 hectares) of land at Holsworthy before the beginning of World War I. Following the declaration of war, all German subjects in Australia were declared ‘enemy aliens’ and were required to report and notify the Government of their address. In February 1915 enemy aliens were interned either voluntarily or on an enforced basis. In New South Wales the principal place of internment was the Holsworthy Internment Camp where between 4,000 and 7,000 men were detained. Most of the internees were from the Austro-Hungarian empire including Germans, Slavic men mostly from Dalmatia, as well as Czechoslovakians and Hungarians, staff of German companies who were living in Australia, crews of ships caught in Australian ports as well as naturalised and native born Australians of German descent. These prisoners were interned without trial. After the war many of these internees were deported to Germany. =Riots= In early 1915 there were riots over rations and work duties.

Description Prasophyllum collinum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single shiny, dark green, tube-shaped leaf, long and wide with a reddish base. Between twelve and thirty lemon-scented flowers are crowded along a flowering spike long. The flowers are greenish brown and white and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide with three fine dark lines. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, wide, and spread apart from each other. The petals are more or less linear in shape, green to purplish, long and wide and greenish, but white near the base. The labellum is white, oblong to egg-shaped, long, wide and turns sharply upwards at more than 90° near its middle. The upturned part of the labellum is wavy or crinkled and there is a yellowish-green callus with a dark green base, in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September and October. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum collinum was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Mount Olinthus and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (collina) is a Latin word meaning \\"of a hill\\" or \\"hilly\\", referring to the hilly terrain where this orchid is often found.

At the top of the ticket, Franklin D. Roosevelt won the state handily in his successful bid to become the 32nd President of the United States. Arkansans elected Hattie Caraway to the United States Senate, the first woman elected to a full term in history. For the United States House of Representatives, Bill Cravens, a former Representative from 1907 to 1913, returned to politics and defeated a wide field in the Arkansas 4th. Tilman Parks defeated several challengers to retain the Arkansas 7th. All of Arkansas's statewide constitutional offices were up for reelection, including governor. Incumbent Harvey Parnell declined to run for reelection, and was supplanted by Junius Marion Futrell. During the Solid South, the Democratic Party held firm control of virtually every office in The South, including Arkansas. Winning the Democratic primary was considered tantamount to election, with several different factions of the party battling in the open primaries. The election was held a few years into the Great Depression, and Americans and Arkansans battling steep unemployment and poverty sought politicians and policies to remedy the economic malaise. Though the state elected big government-liberal Franklin Roosevelt, Futrell represented a realignment toward severe cuts and retrenchment in the governor's mansion. Conservative, small-government Democrats also took state senate and state representative positions across Arkansas. Though 1932 is considered a realignment election nationally toward Democrats and larger government, in Arkansas, Futrell was the most conservative governor elected in decades, marking a shift from Progressive Era-type politicians in Arkansas. President Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover by an 85.96% to 12.91% margin in Arkansas, earning the state's nine electoral votes. His New Deal was very popular in the state, which was struggling with high unemployment and poor prospects for agriculture, which represented most of Arkansas's economy. Federal=United States Senate= Thaddeus H. Caraway held Arkansas's Class III senate from 1920 until his death on November 6, 1931. Per the custom at the time, his wife Hattie Caraway was appointed to serve the remainder of his term. Though she faced several primary challengers, Caraway became the first woman to be elected to a full term in the Senate in November 1932 by an 89.5% to 10.5% margin over John W. White, the Republican. Caraway defeated Vincent Miles, O.L. Bodenhamer, William G. Hutton, William F. Kirby, Melbourne Martin, and Charles Brough. =United States House=State=Governor= rightthumbCounty results, gubernatorial Futrell: Livesay: Did not win any counties =Lieutenant Governor= Incumbent lieutenant governor Lawrence Wilson faced a six-way primary battle for reelection. Though Democratic voters had historically given two two-year terms to faithful politicians, Wilson had become embroiled in scandals after pardoning his brother from a ten-year prison sentence while serving as acting governor, and in his capacity to dissolve three insolvent banks in his home county. Candidates in the Democratic primary were Lieutenant Governor Wilson, Lee Cazort, Paul Grabiel, Fred Hutto, Joe W. Kimysey, R.F. Milwee, and J. Rosser Venable. =Constitutional offices=Attorney General Hal L. Norwood won reelection as Arkansas Attorney General. He was challenged in the Democratic primary by Hal C. Norwood, Boyd Cypert, John C. Sheffield, and J.G. Ragsdale. Secretary of State Ed F. McDonald won reelection as Arkansas Secretary of State unopposed. Auditor J. Oscar Humphrey won reelection as Arkansas State Auditor. He was challenged in the Democratic primary by Roy H. Hand and Charlie Parker. Treasurer Roy V. Leonard won reelection as Arkansas State Treasurer unopposed. State Land Commissioner A new Arkansas State Land Commissioner was elected in 1932. The incumbent, Belva Martin, elected not to pursue reelection. Three men sought the Democratic nomination: William L. DeCamp of Little Rock, George W. Neal of Murfreesboro, and Ed P.

Background Except for the Unionist Ozark counties of Newton and Searcy where Republicans controlled local government, Arkansas since the end of Reconstruction had been a classic one-party Democratic “Solid South” state.See Urwin, Cathy Kunzinger; Agenda for Reform: Winthrop Rockefeller as Governor of Arkansas, 1967-71, p. 32 Disfranchisement of effectively all African-Americans and most poor whites had meant that outside those two aberrant counties, the Republican Party was completely moribund and Democratic primaries the only competitive elections. The 1920s did see a minor change in this, as increased voting by poor Ozark whites as a protest against Woodrow Wilson’s internationalist foreign policy meant that Warren G. Harding was able to win almost forty percent of the statewide vote;Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 211, 287 however despite his national landslide Calvin Coolidge in 1924 could not do any more than win the two traditional Unionist GOP counties. 1928 saw the rest of the Outer South and North Alabama bolt the anti-Prohibition Catholic Al Smith, but the presence of Arkansas Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson as running mate meant that within Arkansas only the most northwesterly counties with ordinarily substantial Republican votes would suffer the same fate.Barnes, Kenneth C.; Anti- Catholicism in Arkansas: How Politicians, the Press, the Klan, and Religious Leaders Imagined an Enemy, 1910–1960, pp. 164-165 The following years saw Arkansas plunge into the Great Depression, followed almost immediately by a major drought from the summer of 1930s until the winter of 1931/1932.Whayne, Jeannie M.; DeBlack, Thomas A.; Sabo, George and Arnold, Morris S.; Arkansas: A Narrative History, pp. 341-342 This came on top of a long depression in agriculture, which was still the dominant player in Arkansas’ economy and was backed up by the “Great Migration” of the state’s agricultural labor force to northeastern and midwestern cities.Whayne, DeBlack, Sabo and Arnold; Arkansas, pp. 313-316 Vote With the Depression not improving, Arkansas gave extremely heavy support to Democrat Franklin Roosevelt in the 1932 election.Grantham, Dewey W.; The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History, p. 102 Roosevelt won every county in the state, becoming the first Democrat to win Searcy County since before the Civil War and only the second to win adjacent Newton County.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, p. 87 Results=Results by county= {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - ! colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" County ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Franklin Delano Roosevelt Democratic ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Herbert Clark Hoover Republican ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Norman Mattoon ThomasGéoelections; 1932 Presidential Election Popular Vote (.xlsx file for €15 on request) Socialist ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" William Hope Harvey Liberty ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" William Z.

As of April 2019, projects had been completed in 16 sub-Saharan countries.  History  China's paramount leader Xi Jinping announced that China would implement satellite TV programs for ten thousand African villages on December 4, 2015 when he was delivering a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. The project, known as “Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages”, is among 10 major cooperation programs to boost cooperation between China and Africa in a period of 3 years.  Goals  Digital Divide is an inequality with regard to access to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies (ICT). African countries are suffering from the Digital Divide and many Africans, especially families in rural areas, are blocked from accessing information and digital technology. One of the main goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is to “significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020”.  Benefits = Population = The project will open a window for African rural families. Through television people will be able to acquire more useful information about the world. They will also have access to agriculture, science or sanitation's knowledge which will impact positively their daily lives. This will expand their horizon and help them to get rid of poverty. Project will also create local jobs. Staff will be hired and trained to maintain hardware and ensure the long-term operation of the project. = Countries = Knowledge and information villagers will have access to will promote the development of rural areas of each country. Access to digital TV will also accelerate digital television transition of the participating countries. That will expand coverage area of African local TV stations and promote TV industry's upgrade in Africa. The project will narrow gaps between countries and regions in Africa, which will reduce inequality between African countries. Digital TV used to be luxury in African markets but the project of “Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages” will help break the monopoly of digital TV industry as well as promote a balanced development in African region.  Villages  There will be total 10,112 villages in 25 African countries benefiting from the project “Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages”. The 25 countries are: Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique, Côte d'Ivoire, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, D.R.C., Guinea, Ghana, Senegal, Cameroon, Rwanda, Burundi, Benin, Eritrea, Chad, Central Africa, Congo Brazzaville, Guinea-Bissau, Namibia and Gabon.  Equipment  Chinese government will aid each village with two Projector TVs, one 32 inch Digital TV set and 20 DTH decoders and satellite dishes. Projector TVs and Digital TV set will be equipped with solar power systems and DTH access units. The Projector TV can project more than 120 inches picture screen in the wall and use DLP technology and LED light source with high brightness and low power. The StarTimes Digital TV set supports signal input of satellite TV without a decoder and its smart operation system supports automatic system maintenance and upgrade. Comparing with CRT TV sets, the Digital TV set saves 50% power and comes with HD LED screen category, Dolby audio system, wide voltage input, HDMI and USB ports. The Projector TVs and Digital TV set will be laid out in the public area of the village, like school or village clinic, which could allow all villagers, especially kids, to enjoy the wonderful digital TV programs. To cope with the problem of power shortage in African rural areas, the Projector TVs and Digital TV set will be outfitted with solar power system, which can support the people to watch TV for 6 hours without electricity after sunset. The decoders adopt the advanced standard H.265, which can support the input of HD digital signals from the satellite directly.  Implementation  Digital TV operator StarTimes has been chosen to carry out the project under the guide of Chinese and African governments. StarTimes will supply all hardware of the project, install them in each village of the 25 countries as well as maintain equipment once the project is complete.

Foto: Urs Juadas, 2015 Heinz Nigg (born 23 August 1949) is a Swiss anthropologist, community artist, and promoter of participatory video. In 1980 he documented the outbreak of the youth riots in Zurich.  Life  Nigg, citizen from Maienfeld and Zurich, grew up with two siblings in Zurich, Switzerland. His parents come from a working-class family and a farmer's family in Maienfeld, Canton of Grisons. His mother was a housewife and dressmaker, whilst his father worked for a non- profit housing association. In 1967/68 Nigg spent one year as an exchange student in the US, where he was inspired by the artistic expression and politics of the Counterculture of the 60s – the Hippies and Yippies.The many protest events of 1968 were documented on film by the Newsreel Collective. They are archived by Third World Newsreel, New York. From 1969 to 1976 he studied history, political science, and social anthropology at Zurich University. At this time he was also an activist in the youth movement and in the rebellious local art scene. During this period he wrote articles about exhibitions of Minimal and Conceptual art for the Tages-Anzeiger, and for the Kunstnachrichten, a journal of international art. In 1974, he traveled to New York as assistant of Johannes Gachnang, director of the Kunsthalle Bern.Nigg, Heinz. Eine Kunstreise nach New York.

He is particularly noted for his coverage of the Arthur Allan Thomas case, and the Mr Asia crime syndicates. Biography Booth was born on 9 September 1929 in Levin and raised in Hawera. His first journalism job was on the Hawera Star in 1947. In 1950, he became a general reporter for The Auckland Star, in the first of what became several periods working at the paper, covering everything from sports to politics and crime. In May 1971, Bishop Delargey of Auckland appointed Booth the editor (in succession to the conservative Denzil Meuli) of the Catholic newspaper Zealandia – the first layman to be appointed its editor. In that capacity he condemned the rock musical Hair, which featured a brief full nudity scene. The New Zealand production was prosecuted and Booth appeared as a police witness. After ten months he resigned from the position citing health issues. A few months before he had written to Delargey stating that he \\"could not have foreseen that what I would have regarded as conventional Catholic journalism would have caused such public differences of opinion, emotion and even intense bitterness.\\"\\"First lay Zealandia editor dies\\", NZ Catholic, 11–24 February 2018, p. 2. Booth returned to work for The Auckland Star, and covered the Mr Asia drug syndicate and the Arthur Allan Thomas cases. Booth began a seven- year campaign to free Thomas. In 1975, he published his book about the case, Trial By Ambush, and won the National Investigative Journalism Award that year. In 1979, Arthur Allan Thomas was pardoned, and, two years later, in the 1981 Queen's Birthday Honours, Booth was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to journalism. In the late 1970s, Booth uncovered the brutal Mr Asia drugs syndicate and one of its key players, Terry Clark. Despite considerable threats, he published a series of articles on the case in The Auckland Star, and then published a book, The Mr Asia File, in 1980. Booth became deputy editor of The Auckland Star in 1977. In 1980, he moved to Radio Pacific as a news executive. Later he worked for North and South magazine, winning the 1988 Media Peace Prize for his article \\"Learning To Live With The Waitangi Tribunal – Facts Without Fear.\\" He later worked for Suburban Newspapers Auckland, a Fairfax subsidiary, where he ran a controversial series on Asian immigration to New Zealand. He was also a regular newspaper columnist and lectured in journalism. He wrote a number of novels and biographies, and published his autobiography, Deadline, in 1997. Booth was active in local-body politics, serving on the Howick Community Board, the Far North District Council, the Northland District and Waitemata District Health Boards, and the Waitakere City Council. Booth died at a rest home in Kumeu, after a short illness, on 31 January 2018, at the age of 88.

Nicely had started fusing psychedelic and electronic music in the late 1970s, and in the early 1980s released two innovative singles, \\"DCT Dreams\\" and \\"Hilly Fields (1892)\\". While the singles were critically acclaimed, they were commercial failures, which partly contributed to Nicely's retirement from the public eye shortly after. While his works were being praised by several of his contemporaries, he continued to record then-unreleased, further material into the mid-1980s, and then again in the late 1990s. As interest in Nicely's work increased in the 2000s, Psychotropia was released with help from compiler David Wells, containing his early 1980s material with a plethora of unreleased tracks, digitally remastered by Nicely. While some categorise the album as a compilation, Nicely regards Psychotropia to be a studio album that just took a great deal of time to record. The original version of the album was a limited edition LP released by Wells through his Tenth Planet imprint, followed by an extended CD edition from Castle Music in 2004. Helping rise Nicely's status as a cult figure, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics, and its sound has been cited as a precursor to the emerging hypnagogic pop movement. Background=Nick Nicely's career= Growing up in Hitchin and Deptford, England, Nick Nicely developed an early fascination with intricate psychedelic music in the 1960s, from artists like Joe Meek, the Beatles, Pink Floyd and King Crimson. His discovery of the eclectic folk compilation Nice Enough to Eat (1969), which featured styles of \\"guitar freak- outs, blues, pastoral folk and psych,\\" was one of his formative influences, and in the mid-1970s he developed into a folk singer, but he soon found inspiration in Euro-disco and from German electronic groups like Neu!, Can and Kraftwerk. He moved to London and developed a solo career, and his 1978 home recordings attracted the attention of music publisher Heath Levy, who intended him to work as an in-house songwriter, but nonetheless, after seeing more of Nicely's demos, they let him record his own songs \\"DCT Dreams\\" and \\"Treeline\\" on an advance sum in a professional studio. Released in 1980 in a pressing of 900 copies on Nicely's own Voxette label, despite release offers from 4AD and Charisma Records, \\"DCT Dreams\\" took influence from the Beatles' psychedelic work, the Human League and his own experiences under LSD; Nicely described it as \\"a psych collision with electronic synth music,\\" and in the words of AllMusic's Heather Phares, the song is \\"half angular synth pop in the vein of Tubeway Army and half the kind of trippy atmosphere that hadn't been heard since the '60s.\\" Fact described \\"DCT Dreams\\" and its B-side \\"Treeline\\" as the missing link between the Beatles and modern day \\"robo-romanticism\\" acts like Gary Numan and John Foxx, and alongside Foxx's The Golden Section (1983), they felt it exemplified synthpop's reconnection with British psychedelia. It was distributed in Europe and South America and even reached number 32 in the Netherlands' singles chart, but made no impact in the United Kingdom, despite a 1981 re-release by German label Ariola Hansa. Finding \\"DCT Dreams\\" to be a burgeoning example of the New Romantic scene, Some Bizzare Records almost included it on their influential compilation Some Bizzare Album (1980), but the compilers were discouraged at the last minute by the song's mild European success. He sold his home studio to finance his subsequent single, \\"Hilly Fields (1892)\\", which he recorded in Alvic Studio over six months, the long recording duration reflecting his increasing perfectionism. Continuing his Beatles-inspired experimentation, he felt the song's \\"early '80s electronics are more muted within the psych vibe\\" than they had been on his previous single. \\"Crammed with ideas\\" according to Fact, the song includes keyboards, cello and drum parts played by friends, and what is considered the earliest example of scratching in a non-hip hop song. Nicely named it after his home of Hillyfields Park, Brockley, a site overlooking both London and Kent. Released on EMI in January 1982, the single failed to gain any commercial traction. Nonetheless, it was released to critical acclaim, and the NME named it \\"the best psychedelic record made since the '60s.\\" The song's B-side \\"49 Cigars\\" was recorded in a much faster space of two days, and was inspired by the Beatles' \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (1966), with both songs being what he felt were \\"disorientating twists of abstract psychedelia, but always wrapped around a tune.\\" The \\"swirling\\" track contains \\"phasers-set-to-stun\\" and a disorienting telephone conversation between Nick Whitecross of Kissing the Pink and his girlfriend. ='Lost' recordings and compilation= A third Nicely single, his 1982 recording \\"On the Coast\\", was proposed for release, but the plans fell through. Nicely felt he was \\"trying too hard to be commercial\\" and did not feel Ian Pearce's drum pattern on the track was suitable, while also refusing to give EMI a single due to their lack of promotion for \\"Hilly Fields (1892)\\", although he also felt bad he had not delivered an album to the label and that he refused to perform live. Prior to its eventual release on Psychotropia, Nicely tweaked the song slightly to improve it. While EMI continued funding Nicely's attempts to create a follow- up single, the sessions of which included \\"Elegant Daze,\\" which is said to be the closest Nicely came to 1980s production, Nicely was losing interest and stopped communicating to EMI, who subsequently dropped him. Heath Levy had \\"shafted\\" Nicely of his royalties and he began a battle with depression that lasted the remainder of the decade. Phares proposes that while Nicely had other tracks ready to release as a singles, the commercial failure of \\"Hilly Fields\\" and the lack of royalties he received from \\"DCT Dreams\\" meant Nicely was unable to create music in the fashion he desired and thus retired from the public eye, his only released musical contributions for the remainder of the 20th century being backing vocals on Paul Roland's A Cabinet of Curiosities (1987) and acid house and rave music collaborations with his friend Gavin Mills under the names Psychotropic, Airtight and Freefall. Besides his rave music, he continued to be inspired by other music in the two decades, including New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\" (1983), Tears for Fears' Songs from the Big Chair (1985) and Portishead's Dummy (1994). In 1997, he once again began recording as Nick Nicely, with new tracks like \\"On the Beach\\" both reflecting his dance music productions as well as his early 1980s sound. During his time away from the public eye, Nicely's unusual blend of electronic pop and psychedelic rock had influenced contemporaries including Robyn Hitchcock of the Soft Boys and Andy Partridge of XTC, while Robert Wyatt spoke highly of \\"49 Cigars\\". XTC's psychedelic side project band The Dukes of Stratosphear were especially inspired by Nicely, with their debut album 25 O'Clock (1985) drawing strong influence from \\"Hilly Fields (1892)\\". Interest in Nicely as a \\"lost legend\\" continued to grow into the 2000s, to the point where British music reissue compiler David Wells, who specialised in compiling compilations of psychedelic music, discovered that Nicely had recorded a wealth of unreleased material beyond his early 1980s singles. Thus, hoping to bring the unreleased material together, he chiefly conceived the idea for Psychotropia, a collection of both Nicely's released and unreleased material, to which Nicely agreed. The album is Nicely's first album and first release as Nick Nicely since 1982. John Reed, Jon Richards and Steve Hammonds are credited as the album's coordinators. Nicely remastered all the tracks himself. Composition The influence of the Beatles' psychedelic work helped influence Nicely's work. Psychotropia contains the four songs from Nicely's 1980s singles as well as a collection of demos, mostly taken from old cassette tapes, that he had recorded throughout the years. While some categorise the album as a compilation, Nicely disagrees and thinks of Psychotropia as \\"all one album,\\" albeit with \\"just a lot of years\\" between the songs' recording dates. The original, limited edition LP edition of the album contains thirteen songs recorded between 1979–1985 and one from 1997, while the original CD version contains eighteen tracks recorded between 1979–2004, with the additional tracks being Nicely's recordings from 1997–98, 2003 and 2004. The re-released CD contains an extra track, \\"Marlon\\", recorded in 1986. The song was recorded with Peter Marsh on a 4-track recorder. The album documents Nicely's work as a mixer of psychedelic rock and electronic pop, while also reflecting Nicely's experience with dance music in the album's later-produced songs. Richie Unterberger said the album combines sounds of 1967-68 British psychedelic music with elements from post-1980 electronics and production, noting the influence of Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd and the Beatles' work of 1967, as well as a possibly equal influence from \\"all those obscure British acts that have filled up U.K. '60s psych rarities compilations from the time of Chocolate Soup for Diabetics onward.\\" Nicely combines elements of those styles, including phasing, unusual electronic manipulation, the \\"melancholic buzzing orchestral waves\\" of keyboards, guitars and strings, vocals that have been cited as \\"underwater- and outer space-beamed\\" as well as brief, distant spoken phrases. Jim Irvin wrote of Psychotropia: \\"It feels like three decades of music–Beatles, Eno, Utopia, Buggles, MBV—flashing by in a spaceship, a delirious pop fans ecstatic narcotic rush,\\" while, finding some of its songs to pay tribute to music of the past while anticipating music yet to come, and making note of the conspicuous usage of the Fairlight synth on some songs, Uncut found the album to be a work of \\"faux-psych\\" and post-psychedelia. Algemeen Dagblad found the album to bridge the gap between 1960s psychedelia, 1980s New Romantic and 2000s new wave revival. Sound effects, studio trickery and oscillations complement the hooky melodies, erudite lyrics and \\"controlled production.\\" The lyrical bent was described by Richard Mason of Ugly Things as possessing a \\"deeply personal and impressionistic nature,\\" while he felt that wistful melodies and psychedelic modalities are among the album's key characteristics. He felt the album reflects Nicely's position as a part of the DIY music scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s. =Songs= Nicely's favourite song on the album, \\"On the Beach (The Ladder Descends)\\", was inspired by a depressed, post-natal woman who lived on an island off the Essex/Suffolk coast and who committed suicide by walking out of her house and drowning in the sea, with the song's first lyrics marked by existentialist themes and the remaining lyrics conceptually dealing with self-destruction. Recorded in 1997–98, Nicely was only able to master the song onto a cassette recorder, hence its lo-fidelity quality. The song is a whooshing, refined work of psychedelic pop minimalism with elements of Balearic music to belie its \\"post-rave provenance.\\" Critic Ian Shirley said the song impresses listeners with the music's inventive 'persuasion.' One journalist described \\"Beverly\\" as \\"[looking] back to Scott Walker and forward to The Beloved and Ibiza bliss.\\" The title track \\"Psychotropia\\" features what Nicely felt was a disorientating \\"feeling of release.\\" His desire to pursue such 'freedom' was partly down to his love of freeform soloing in works such as John Coltrane's Blue Train (1958). Dating from 1979, \\"1923\\" is one of the oldest recordings on the album, recorded on a 4-track recorder in Nicely's home in Brockley, London. Nicely's friend Geoff Leach contributed, playing piano and creating abstract sounds which Nicely taped and added to the track. However, the song's potential publishers Heath Levy were uninterested in the song. Nicely included the song on the album as he found many people liked it, but when asked what song he would take off the album if he could, he picked \\"1923\\". \\"Everyone Knows\\" was recorded in 1998, though still bears the \\"omnipresent melodic touch, wistful ambience and focused vision\\" of Nicely's earlier work. Release Reflecting interest in Nicely's music, Psychotropia has been released three times. Psychotropia was first released as an 180gm audiophile LP in 2003 by David Wells' own label Tenth Planet, with artwork from Phil Smee and sleevenotes from Wells. This in turn led to a CD version released on 5 July 2004 by Castle Music. This edition features five extra tracks and new artwork (described by one critic as Pythonesque) from Tom Ornshaw, while retaining Wells' sleevenotes. Following the financial problems of Castle Music's parent label Sanctuary Records, the CD edition was soon deleted from print. In 2010, the album was made available on CD again in a new version by Cherry Red Records, this version containing the bonus track \\"Marlon\\" and another new sleeve design, by Andy Morton of Pepperbox. =Critical reception= One account said that the album was released to acclaim from music critics. Reviewing the original LP release, Richard Mason of Ugly Things was favourable, praising the album's \\"uncanny feel of a realised and structured album rather than the compilation it actually is. This is surely a testament to the singular originality and determinedly individualistic talent of Nick Nicely. The lyrical and musical continuity is startling. Beautiful, wistful melodies comprised with a lyrical bent of a deeply personal and impressionistic nature.\\" Among those reviewing the CD, Matthjis Linneman of OOR highly recommended the album and wrote that, despite Nicely's career ending with commercial failure in 1982, Psychotropia \\"proves that his song writing abilities have remained constant over the years\\" while away from the public eye, citing for instance \\"On the Beach (The Ladder Descends),\\" which he felt \\"approaches the quality of 'Hilly Fields'.\\" Adam Clayson of Record Collector called Psychotropia \\"[a] retrospective that transcends mere period charm.\\" Jim Irvin of Mojo said the album \\"feels like three decades of music- Beatles, Eno, Utopia, Buggles, MBV-flashing by in a spaceship, a delirious pop fans ecstatic narcotic rush. Personally, I'd have edited it into a concise, perfect 12 tracker, but you can do that yourself. Marvellous.\\" Uncut felt that \\"Mr Nicely does a very pleasing line in faux-psych.\\" While finding the weaker songs to \\"sound like Soft Cell outtakes or Erasure on ketamine,\\" they felt the best material \\"belongs with the pantheon of great post-psychedelica,\\" alongside Prince's Around the World in a Day (1985). Richie Unterberger of AllMusic named the record an \\"Album Pick,\\" but also felt \\"there's also an overall air of clouded disengagement and retreat into an impenetrable imaginary world, which makes his work less gripping than that of the best astral minstrels of yore. If those embellishments are enough for you, this is ear candy, with a lot of dense layers of sound that take a while to get your mind around, even if it's sometimes like being caught in a hallucinogenic crossfire.\\" Reviewing the 2010 reissue, Ian Shirley of Record Collector said: \\"Despite being recorded at different times between the 80s and 00s, tracks such as 'Elegant Daze' and 'On the Coast' hang together like the two sides of a fantastic lost classic.\\" He also praised David Wells' sleeve notes. =Legacy= Artists including Ariel Pink (pictured) lauded the album. Ariel Pink played live with Nicely in 2008. In gathering Nicely's material in an anthology style, Psychotropia helped make it easier to listen to his body of work, and since the album's release, his reputation has grown. Acclaim for the album poured in from artists including Ariel Pink and John Maus, both of whom Nicely would perform live dates with in 2008 and 2012. Other artists from American underground music such as Nite Jewel and Gary War too praised the album. The simultaneous hypnagogic pop scene, to which Ariel Pink and John Maus are linked, revived interest in Nicely's work, and today his 1980s recordings are seen as \\"the sound of the 2000s hypnagogic pop movement decades beforehand.\\" Rock band Temples called Psychotropia a \\"completely overlooked album. It should be a classic album, but it’s overlooked completely.\\" Unkle enjoyed the album, and approached Nicely for collaboration on their song \\"Puppeteers\\" (2011), a song Nicely described as more psychedelic than his usual style. Amorphous Androgynous included \\"49 Cigars\\" on their critically acclaimed various artists compilation A Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble Exploding in Your Mind: Volume 1 (2008). Nick Nicely would begin making music more regularly, releasing several albums in the 2010s, including Space of a Second (2014) and Sleep Safari (2017).

She is the third Breakaway Plus-class ship in the fleet, following sister ships Norwegian Bliss, Norwegian Escape, and Norwegian Joy, and debuted in November 2019.  History = Construction and delivery = Norwegian Encore at Meyer Werft, August 2019.  Planning and construction  On 14 July 2014, NCL announced that it had reached an agreement with Meyer Werft for a €1.6 billion order of two new Breakaway Plus- class ships, scheduled for delivery in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Each ship was initially estimated to be approximately and have 4,200 passenger berths. In February 2017, it was announced that the ship scheduled for delivery in 2019 would be designed for the Chinese market, much like her sister ship, Norwegian Joy. However, in January 2018, it was later announced that the ship would instead be designed for the Western market like her other sister ship, Norwegian Bliss. Construction started with the ship's steel cutting on 31 January 2018, the day her name was also announced as Norwegian Encore. Her keel-laying ceremony was performed on 28 November 2018, accompanied by a performance from Kinky Boots. Norwegian Encore's float-out was on 17 August 2019 and the ship was towed from the building dock to receive her funnel cladding and further outfitting. The ship began her scheduled conveyance along the Ems towards the Eemshaven for her sea trials on 30 September 2019 and completed it on 1 October.  Delivery and christening  Norwegian Encore was delivered to NCL on 30 October 2019 in Bremerhaven. Andy Stuart, then- president and CEO of NCL, announced on The Kelly Clarkson Show on 10 September 2019 that Kelly Clarkson would be the godmother to Norwegian Encore. Clarkson performed at the christening ceremony and officially named the vessel on 21 November 2019 in Miami prior to the ship's debut in the Caribbean on 24 November. = Deployments and operational career = Inaugural season  For her inaugural season, Norwegian Encore held different preview events in Europe, with a preview cruise from Bremerhaven to Southampton, before her inaugural voyage, an 8-day transatlantic sailing between Southampton and New York. The ship held different preview events in New York and Miami upon her arrival in North America, prior to his christening and debut. Following her debut in Miami, her deployment covered the Eastern Caribbean through the rest of her inaugural season. In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, after the last passengers had disembarked following NCL's suspension of operations, it was reported that several crew members had become sick and one who had already disembarked was later diagnosed with the coronavirus.  Future deployments  Norwegian Encore is scheduled to homeport in New York in summer 2020 to sail to Bermuda, the Maritimes, and New England, before moving back to Miami in winter 2020 to cruise the Western Caribbean. In spring 2021, she will make her first full Panama Canal transit to be deployed to Seattle for her first summer Alaska season.  Design and specifications  Norwegian Encore has an overall length of , moulded beam and maximum draft . The ship has gross tonnage of and deadweight of . Norwegian Encore has 20 decks, 2,043 staterooms and capacity for 4,004 passengers at double occupancy. Norwegian Encore has five main engines with total output power of .

He was elected as the first African American male to hold the position in November 2015. Davis is known for boycotting his own city council to protest segregation, racism, and alleged financial irregularities. In December 2017, national civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump represented Rufus Davis and a newly-elected city councilman, Venterra Pollard, in demanding that the city of Camilla remove a 4-foot fence in the city-owned cemetery that separated Blacks and Whites. Education Davis received his Bachelors from the University of Michigan and Juris Doctor from Rutgers Law. During his undergraduate and graduate years he studied at the University of Economics in Prague, Czech Republic and Leiden University Faculty of Law in the Netherlands. Davis also holds an Executive Education Certificate from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University for Senior Leaders in State and Local Government.https://www.albanyherald.com/news/camilla-mayor-rufus-davis- completes-harvard-leadership- program/article_dfc30a20-b2df-11e9-aa8c-c7f6f6c495ec.html The Camilla Movement In January 2018 Rufus Davis announced that he had started the Camilla (Georgia) Movement to bring needed social, economic and political reform to the city of Camilla. He described the movement as the first franchise of a wider Social Project that would also serve other communities faced with challenges related to inclusion, diversity and access to opportunities.https://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2018/01/18/rashad-richeys-plight- for-justice-in-camilla-ga/ Camilla, Georgia controversy After being elected Mayor of the City of Camilla, a White City Manager, Bennett, refused to give Mayor Davis Keys to City Hall. In a 6-0, unanimous vote, the city council agreed with Bennett to deny Davis's request for keys. On December 4, 2017, Davis and newly elected councilman, Venterra Pollard, announced that they would be boycotting city council meetings. This decision was sparked by a recommendation by the city manager, at that time, that the city adopt a new charter. The new city charter would delegate authority to the city manager to appoint all council committees, commissions, boards, and the city attorney. Davis alleged that although the City of Camilla was 70% Black, the city-owned cemetery was segregated, with Black and White sections separated by a fence. There were no Black police officers Only three blacks worked in city hall in jobs clerical or higher Almost all Blacks that applied to jobs inside city hall were rejected. 99% of White students attended the historically all-white private school 99% of all Black students attended the under-funded public school The city was hyperly-gerrymandered. The alleged statistics drew national and international attention and tremendous public support. And on January 6, 2017 amid a legal threat made by attorney, Benjamin Crump the city of Camilla dismantled the fence in the city-owned Oakview cemetery. Davis called this the first of several fences that needed to be removed, referring to metaphorical fences in the police department, city hall, job opportunities and city government. One of the biggest allegations made regarding the city- owned cemetery involved a Black man who passed for White. After being buried on the White side of the cemetery, his body had to be exhumed and reburied on the Black side of the cemetery. The Racial Recall In March 2017, White residents of Camilla, Georgia, angered over unflattering national media attention based on Davis' allegations of racism, began an unsuccessful campaign to recall him from office. The recall failed after the petitioners could not obtain the number of necessary signatures, as required by Georgia Law. Over 90% of those who signed the recall petition against Davis were White residents. Hence the recall campaign was dubbed as the Racial Recall. Ironically, the recall effort was led by an elderly African-American woman, Vivian Smith. Smith had been recently voted off the Camilla city council a few months earlier, losing to Venterra Pollard, a candidate endorsed by Davis. Pollard would later join Mayor Davis in boycotting city council meetings. In 2016, the previous year, Camilla residents in support of Mayor Davis launched a recall of four members of the Camilla city council, Vivian Smith, Bryant Campbell, W.D Palmer and Annie Doris Willingham. The recall was based on complaints that the city council was not responsive to the concerns of the citizens. Tensions among citizens erupted after council members refused to attend a special call meeting by the mayor. The meeting was called after the White city manager, Bennett Adams, refused to provide Davis keys to city hall, claiming that no mayor before Davis had ever had keys to city hall.https://www.walb.com/story/31452018/camilla-group-working-to-recall-city- council-members Prior to becoming elected Mayor, Davis lead a citizens group called \\"We the people v. City Hall.\\" The group opposed high utility rates and lack of fair representation from both Black and White city officials.https://wfxl.com/news/local/tensions-rise-amongst-camilla-residents- city-council  Personal life  Rufus Davis was formerly married to Zuzana Finn, a daughter of the former Slovak Ambassador to the US, Martin Bútora.

Life Born at the rectory, Gayton, Northamptonshire, on 19 August 1831, he was the third son of George Butler, Dean of Peterborough, and his wife Sarah Maria Gray, eldest daughter of John Gray of Wembley Park, Middlesex. His youngest brother, Henry Montagu Butler, became Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. He entered Rugby School under A. C. Tait in August 1844, and was admitted as a scholar of University College, Oxford, in March 1850. At Oxford, Gray was an original member of the Essay Club founded in 1852 by his friend George Joachim Goschen, and was president of the Oxford Union in 1853. In the same year, he won the Ireland scholarship, and graduated B.A. with a first class in the final classical school. He was elected a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford in 1856, proceeding M.A. in the following year. He did not reside on his fellowship: returning to Rugby School in 1858, he served as assistant master under Frederick Temple, and was ordained deacon in 1861 and priest in 1862. On the reconstitution of Haileybury College in 1862, Butler was appointed the first headmaster. In September, the school took over the buildings of the East India College near Hertford, founded in 1805 for the training of the East India Company's civil servants. Haileybury had no endowment, and inconvenient infrastructure. Butler introduced the Rugby School system, and himself served as school chaplain. He provided racquets and fives courts. The houses were named after prominent British officials in India. Pupil numbers rose in a few years from 54 to 360. Butler was a stimulating classical teacher, but a breakdown in health compelled his resignation in December 1867. By that time, Haileybury was a recognised English public school. On resuming work in 1874, Butler served as chaplain of the Royal Indian Civil Engineering College, which was established at Coopers Hill near Egham in 1871. Returning to Oxford in 1875, he settled as dean and tutor at Oriel. He was select preacher before the university in 1885 as well as Whitehall preacher. A liberal in politics, he promoted better housing of the poor and the higher education of women in Oxford. Over the Irish home rule issue, he became a Liberal Unionist. He resigned his official position in 1895; it was partly under his influence that Oriel College and the university benefited by the will of Cecil Rhodes. He was elected to an honorary fellowship at Oriel in 1907. Butler died at Torquay on 16 January, 1909, and was buried in Holywell cemetery, Oxford. At Haileybury, his name was commemorated by the Butler prizes for English literature. In 1910, a fund was raised by former pupils to found a Butler scholarship, and a tablet was erected to his memory in the chapel. Works Butler published two dramas, Charles I (1874; 2nd edit. 1907) and Harold (1892; 2nd edit. 1906), and two volumes of verse entitled The Choice of Achilles (1900) and Hodge and the Land (1907). In The Three Friends: a Story of Rugby in the Forties (1900), he recorded the effect produced on his contemporaries by the early poems of Alfred Tennyson. It also documented the early friendships of Matthew Arnold, A. H. Clough, and Theodore Walrond.

The song became popular after being selected by New Zealand's Ministry of Education for inclusion in schoolbooks.  History  Huata wrote \\"Tūtira Mai Ngā Iwi\\" while part of an Ecumenical Movement in the late 1950s. He was driving from Wairoa, Hawke's Bay with his children and passed Lake Tūtira. He would sing the lyrics and his children would repeat them, learning it as they drove to Napier. The waiata eventually grew in popularity through Huata performing it in churches and Bible classes. By the 1960s, the New Zealand government's Ministry of Education picked up the waiata and started publishing it for use in New Zealand's schools without Huata's consent and didn't credit him as the author. As a result after 50 years of being used in schools, his daughter revealed that some of the lyrics were published incorrectly. On 28 May 2020 the song was published on YouTube, performed by members of the navy, army and airforce bands in a musical partnership between the New Zealand and United States armed forces. The song's composer was Wiremu Te Tau Huata who was a New Zealand military chaplain to the 28th Maori Battalion. His whānau gave permission for the waiata to be used. Meaning While there is some conjecture about the exact words in the song (a situation matching that of many older folk songs worldwide) there is general agreement that it is a song of unity, with the repeated refrain of \\"tātou tātou e\\" ( \\"all of us, all of us\\"). The song is often used by New Zealanders in times when standing together and supporting each other is appropriate. The song was, for example, used to show support with the New Zealand Muslim community after the Christchurch mosque shootings.Video of \\"Tūtira Mai Ngā Iwi\\" being sung outside Dunedin mosque in aftermath of Christchurch shootings  Rugby  In 2017, the New Zealand Rugby Union started a campaign for the 2017 British and Irish Lions tour for New Zealand national rugby union team fans to adopt \\"Tūtira Mai Ngā Iwi\\" as a rallying chant to try to outsing the British and Irish Lions fans. The campaign was led by the New Zealand Police constable and former All Black Glen Osborne. However the attempt was poorly received by All Blacks fans. The Lions fans also hijacked the song changing the chorus from \\"Tatou, Tatou\\" to \\"Lions, Lions\\". The New Zealand media criticised the NZRU for attempting to manufacture a favourable atmosphere, believing that \\"Tūtira Mai Ngā Iwi\\" was an inappropriate choice.

(DHFL) is a deposit-taking housing finance company, headquartered in Mumbai with branches in major cities across India. DHFL was established to enable access to economical housing finance to the lower and middle income groups in semi-urban and rural parts of India. DHFL is the second housing finance company to be established in the country. The company also leases commercial and residential premises. DHFL is among the 50 biggest financial companies in India. DHFL is rated ICRA D by ICRA Limited.  History  DHFL was established and incorporated by Rajesh Kumar Wadhawan on 11 April 1984. The name of the company was changed to Dewan Housing Development Finance Ltd. and later to Dewan Housing Finance Corporation. In 2010, DHFL acquired Deutsche Postbank Home Finance unit for ₹1079 crores. On 18 December 2013, DHFL acquired 74% stake DHFL Pramerica Life Insurance Company Ltd. On 29 January 2019, Cobrapost, an Indian investigative journalist group, published an exposé of DHFL for using various shell corporations to siphon more than ₹ 31,000 crores of public money for the personal gains of the DHFL's primary stakeholders: Kapil Wadhawan, Aruna Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan.https://web.archive.org/web/20190129141356/https://cobrapost.com/blog/press- realise-dhfl-l/1374 In the same article, Cobrapost also raised allegations of political donations worth crores of rupees, in violation of Section 182 of Companies Act, 2013 for political donations. DHFL filed a response with the Bombay Stock Exchange saying the allegations raised by Cobrapost were untrue. DHFL, also rebutted these allegations in a hosted investors / analysts conference and clarified that the ₹ 31,000 crore loans mentioned in the allegation consist of its project loan portfolio. Also the company tried to clarify that the advances commented by Cobrapost should be ₹ 21,000 Crores and not ₹ 31,000 crores. Following the Cobrapost allegations, Indian credit rating agencies reaffirmed their high safety rating for the financial instruments issued by DHFL. Even after the emergence of serious allegations of misconduct against its business, the Indian credit rating agencies continued to issue high safety ratings for the DHFL financial products, but, on 6 June 2019, DHFL defaulted on its debt repayment, resulting in a debt rating downgrade, immediately wiping out 16% of the value from its stock price. At the time, the fall in DHFL stock price was an all year low. This rapid decline in stock price resulted in a loss of investor confidence. On 20 November 2019, the Reserve Bank of India removed the board of directors of the company citing corporate governance failure and the company's defaulted payment obligations.  Current issues and Probes against DHFL  In 2019, DHFL stopped payment of bonds and defaulted on its loan obligations. This caused its stock to fall over 97% and a government intervention in the company. In August 2019, as efforts to draft a resolution plan by restructuring DHFL debt into equity, a few of the DHFL bond holders moved to the debt recovery tribunal, which could impact the resolution process. The company meanwhile offered to repay all investors in full with due process of inter-creditor-agreement. In October 2019, the Enforcement Directorate conducted raids at several places of DHFL offices and promoter residences and found links of money laundering activity in loans given to firms closely linked to the promoters of the company. Additionally the trail of the loan given by DHFL to Sunblink real estate in 2010 lead to gangster Iqbal Mirchi, an accomplice of the organized crime mastermind Dawood Ibrahim.https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics- and-nation/dhfl-lent-rs-2186-crore-to-company-under-lens-for-mirchi-links-ed- investigations-reveal/articleshow/71623886.cms On 20 November 2019, under Section 45-IE (I) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Indian central bank removed the board of directors of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL). The reasons cited by the banking regulator for the dismissal of the DHFL board of directors were: inadequate governance and the various defaults on its payment obligations.https://web.archive.org/web/20200213085754/https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=48684 On 27 January 2020, the promoter of DHFL, Kapil Wadhawan was arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

After being disbanded for many years, the Pioneer Corps was re-raised during World War-II in the following to provide semi skilled labour to work with Engineer units or tasks such as demolition, construction of roads, tracks bridges, defences & water supply and to provide unskilled labour where required. By the wars end a total of approximately 300,000 such workers had been engaged of which 21,000 were Indians. Extensive use was made of pioneers in the British Indian Army because of the demands of campaigning in difficult terrain with little or no infrastructure. The twelve Indian Pioneer regiments in existence in 1914 were trained and equipped for road, rail and engineering work, as well as for conventional infantry service. While this dual function did not qualify them to be regarded as elite units, the frequency with which they saw active service made postings to pioneer regiments popular with British officers. The Pioneer Corps were disbanded in 1933 and their personnel mostly transferred into the Corps of Sappers and Miners, whose role they had come to parallel. It was concluded that the Pioneer battalions had become less technically effective than the Sappers and Miners, but too well trained in specialist functions to warrant being used as ordinary infantry. In addition, their major role of frontier road building had now been allocated to civilian workers. Post-Independence of India The re- organization commenced in 1940 at Jhelum (now in Pakistan). Thereafter it became the Auxiliary Pioneers Corps in 1941 and subsequently the Indian Auxiliary Pioneer Corps with effect from 13 October 1942. 25 November 1941 is celebrated as the Raising day of the Pioneer Corp.

The village has about eighty households which are basically mud huts in three clusters. The approach to the village is a dirt road that winds through hilly terrain. The source of water supply to Pandri village is a dam situated close to the village. First solar-powered village in India Pandri is the first decentralized solar-powered village in India. An initiative by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's Art of Living Foundation which is a non-profit organization and by the Sri Sri Rural Development Program in West Bengal, set up the solar plant at a cost of about 4,500,000 Indian rupees. Pandri was chosen for this project as it had all year water supply due to its proximity to a dam situated near the village. Logistically, it was hard to set up the solar power plant due to bad roads and the steep climb for the supply trucks to reach Pandri. The other issue in setting up the solar plant was that labor (which included masons) and electricians initially refused to work in the area and around the village, as it was an area affected by Maoists. Covering about 2,000 square feet with about 75 solar panels, the solar power project was completed in 2015, generating about 1.2 kilowatts per panel of solar-power supplying clean energy to about 80 households.

He was a pioneer of ultra-running in the Netherlands. In 1974 he ran from his hometown Hoek van Holland to Stockholm (1600 km) in 18 days. In 1979 he ran the 400 km around the IJsselmeer-lake in 43 hours and 17 minutes - an unofficial world record. His marathon performances were moderate however. On 18 March 1979 he won the Groet Uit Schoorl (marathon) in 2: 35.31. Knippenberg was born in Hoek van Holland, moved from Castricum to Texel in 1984, and became a history teacher, consecutively connected to the Casimir College in Vlaardingen, the Bonhoeffer College in Castricum and OSG De Hogeberg on Texel. He also made a voyage to the islands of Spitsbergen in 1988 by sailing ship and lived among the reindeer in Scotland. Knippenberg wrote columns in the Dutch edition of Runner's World magazine. In the 1980s he was a member of the editorial board of Op Lemen Voeten, a Dutch magazine for long-distance hikers. He also wrote a book De mens als duurloper (Man as endurance runner; 1987). In this work he supplemented historical information about ultra-running, in which he strongly leaned on the book Indian Running by the American author Peter Nabokov (1981), with added personal experiences. In 2008 an edition revised by his son Mikel Knippenberg was published. On the island of Texel, Knippenberg regularly organized the Ronde van Texel or Texel round trip (60 km). In 1995 it turned out that he suffered from incurable cancer. Knippenberg died of cancer in Texel, at the age of 47. The Jan Knippenberg Memorial is a Dutch ultra-running event that was held several times in commemoration of this Dutch pioneer, a race over one hundred English miles from Hoek van Holland over the Dutch North Sea beaches to Den Helder.

It comprises the world's largest stages and water tanks designed for filming. As well as major film work the facility is used for making commercials, music videos, television series, and movies for television. Originally built for Twentieth Century Fox for the reconstruction of RMS Titanic in the 1997 film Titanic, it has since then built some of the largest sets for numerous other studios including, MGMs Tomorrow Never Dies, Amblin Entertainments In Dreams, Warner Bros.s Deep Blue Sea, Phoenix Picturess Weight of Water, Disneys Pearl Harbor and Fox's Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. The studios are near Rosarito, Baja California, Mexico. History Fox Baja Studios began life as a subsidiary of Twentieth Century Fox, a part of the global corporate holdings of Rupert Murdoch on land leased by the Hollywood studio. Construction of the facility costing an estimated $20 million USD began on 6 June 1996 on land leased by the Hollywood studio next to the northern edge of a small fishing village (Puerto Popotla). The corporation had an interest in breaking the power in Hollywood of the Teamsters Union, the corporation had learned from the Wapping dispute. The studios design was heavily influenced by the production needs of the first film to be shot there; James Cameron's epic Titanic, where there was a requirement to shoot a 775 foot long replica of the ship in a water tank. Fox sold the Studios in May 2007 to Baja Acquisitions (a consortium of \\"local financial interests\\") for an eight-figure US Dollar sum. There was a downturn in the area from 2007 when tourism lessened due to a local drug war and a tightening of travel restrictions. Popotla had become attractive to smugglers of illegal immigrants at night once the restaurant trade had closed for the day. In 2018 a resurgence in film making for net streaming by Amazon, HBO, and Netflix lifted prospects for the studio. Facilities Tank ship mounted on a gimbal in Tank 1, with the unobstructed infinite horizon on the right The studio is built alongside the ocean coastline, enabling an unobstructed view of the sea. It comprises 51 acres of land overlooking the Pacific Ocean, with 2,000 feet of coastline frontage. The facility has 5 stages and 4 indoor and outdoor water tanks, street sets, and is a self-contained facility, with offices, scenery shops, wardrobe and dressing rooms. Two of the stages and three of the tanks are combined. There are four tanks of a combined volume of over 20 million gallons fed by a filtration sea water plant capable of delivering 9,000 gallons of water per minute. Tank 1 is an infinite horizon pond which adjoins and overlooks the Pacific, it is a 360,000 square foot concrete pool with a full capacity of 17 million gallons, used for exterior shooting, wet or dry, and consists of three depth levels between 3 1/2 to 40 feet. The tank can be emptied or filled in 40 hours. Alongside is a 162-foot motor driven tower crane, used for constructing film sets, and as a lighting and camera platform. There is a smaller outdoor tank and another two built into an indoor stage. The tank was built to film Titanic. Studio tour Fox created a Studio Tour named Foxploration, which opened in May 2001 consisting largely of Titanic exhibits, Fox derived displays, and items from other films notably Master and Commander.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It has been demolished. History Former location of the Lovell-Webber House Lovell-Webber House, c. 1881 Cyrus Lovell was born in Vermont in 1804 and came to Michigan in 1829. He settled for two years in Ann Arbor, then moved the Kalamazoo. In 1836 he moved again, this time to Ionia, where he established the first law practice in the town. Soon after, in 1837, he constructed the first portion of this residence, a two-story Greek Revival structure. Also in 1837 he became the first supervisor of Ionia Township. In 1848 and 1854 he was elected to the state legislature in 1848 and 1854, and was chosen as Speaker of the House in 1855. Lovell lived in the house until 1873, when he sold the house to George W. Webber, and purchased Webber's former house. Lovell died in 1895. George W. Webber was born in Vermont in 1925 and moved to Michigan in 1852. He worked for six years in lumbering in Manistee County and then began a retail business in Lyons, Michigan. In 1861 he moved to Ionia, becoming engaged in both lumbering and farming. In 1873 he organized the Second National Bank of Ionia; that same year he purchased this house from Cyrus Lovell. After purchasing the house, Webber hired architect Orry Waterbury to design some substantial alterations, with the original house raised and placed atop a new first floor. Webber served as Ionia's mayor in 1874 and 1875, and was elected to the 47th United States Congress in 1880. At some point, he added a second floor porch that gave the house a steamboat Gothic look. He owned this house until his death in 1900. Afterward, the house was turned into a combination apartment and residence. The house was demolished at some point after 1974. Description The Lovell-Webber House was a large rambling wooden structure, measuring about 60 feet across and a little more deep. It consisted of a main, three-story section and a two-story addition. It sat on a rough stone foundation, and the main section had a truncated hip roof while the addition had a gabled roof. The main section had long, narrow paneless windows on the first floor (built in the 1870s), with unpaneled doors. The upper floors (constructed in the 1830s) had six over six windows encased in plain wooden molding, and the second floor door was paneled and surrounded by a plain transom and sidelights. Porch columns also varied between the stories.

Formed in mid-1941, the division was destroyed during Operation Typhoon later that year. It was reformed in early 1942 and fought in the Battle of Stalingrad, then was relocated to participate in Operation Kutuzov and the advance into eastern Belarus from mid to late 1943. In early 1944 it was again shifted to northwestern Ukraine, advancing into Poland during mid-1944 as part of Operation Bagration. The division received the Order of the Red Banner and the Kovel honorific in recognition of actions in northwestern Ukraine, and in early 1945 participated in the Vistula–Oder Offensive, the East Pomeranian Offensive, and the Berlin Offensive, receiving the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class, for its actions. Remaining in eastern Germany for several months after the end of the war, it was relocated to the Moscow Military District for disbandment in 1946.  First formation  The division began forming on 2 July 1941 near Kalinin, part of the Moscow Military District. It included the 1026th, 1028th, and 1030th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 689th Artillery Regiment. The 260th spent about a month forming near Kalinin, and on 15 August was relocated south to the frontline near Tula, where it joined the 50th Army of the Bryansk Front, under the command of Colonel Vasily Khokhlov. The division fought in the direction of Bryansk and Kaluga. The division was still holding positions there when the German 2nd Panzer Group attacked in Operation Typhoon, the attack beginning the Battle of Moscow. At the time, the 260th fielded 9,755 men, 324 machine guns, 98 artillery pieces and mortars, four anti-aircraft guns, and fifteen anti-tank guns. It was surrounded in the Bryansk pocket but escaped complete destruction. Despite this, only 1,000 officers and men were left in the division by early November. It was withdrawn into the reserve north of Tula, and its remnants were disbanded on 17 November due to a lack of resources to rebuild it since the front was under unrelenting pressure from German attacks.  Second formation  The division was reformed under the command of Colonel Alexander Chizhov between April and 13 May 1942 at Volokolamsk, just west of Moscow in the Moscow Military District, from the 55th Rifle Brigade. It included the 1026th, 1028th, and the 1030th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 738th Artillery Regiment. The 260th was assigned to the Moscow Defense Zone in July, and then to the Voronezh Front reserves in September. In late September it was moved to the front as part of the 1st Guards Army of the Don Front, holding positions to the northwest of Stalingrad. In late September, for \\"nonfulfillment of military tasks\\" in the Samofolovka area, Chizhov was relieved of command and demoted to become chief of staff of the 273rd Rifle Division. He was replaced by Colonel Grigory Miroshnichenko, who led the 260th in counterattacks against German troops who had broken through to the Volga from the Samofolovka area. From late September, it led attacks in an attempt to capture Khutor Borodkin. The 1st Guards Army was withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK) in mid-October, and the division transferred to the 24th Army of the front. The division fought in the Battle of Stalingrad during Operation Uranus and Operation Koltso between November 1942 and February 1943, successively part of the 24th and 65th Armies of the Don Front. Until January, it fought in the Kotluban area at checkpoint 564. Beginning on 18 January, the 260th advanced on the Barrikady Factory. After the battle ended with the surrender of the German 6th Army in early February, the 260th was transferred to the Don Front reserve, then to the Stalingrad Group of Forces. Soviet soldiers during the Bryansk Offensive At the end of March, the division relocated to the Tula area as part of the 11th Army in the RVGK. The army transferred to the Western Front on 12 July and to the Bryansk Front on 30 July, fighting in Operation Kutuzov and the Bryansk Offensive during the summer offensive. About 18 August Miroshnichenko was seriously wounded and evacuated to a hospital; he was replaced by Colonel Stepan Maximovsky. The 260th became part of the army's 53rd Rifle Corps in August, fighting in battles for Bryansk and the crossing of the Desna River, during which Maximovsky was wounded and evacuated. He was briefly replaced by Colonel Gennady Pankov, who was in turn replaced by Colonel Vasily Bulgakov in November, when it was part of the Belorussian Front during the Gomel–Rechitsa Offensive. During that operation, the division crossed the Sozh River and helped capture Gomel. After it transitioned to the defensive on the approach to Zhlobin and the disbandment of the 11th Army, the division and its corps became part of the 63rd Army. In December the division fought in attacks to the north of Gomel and Zhlobin. The division transferred back to the RVGK in the Moscow Military District at the end of January, and was briefly assigned to the 70th Army, joining the 125th Rifle Corps, which was in the process of formation, in February. With the corps, the division was sent to the 47th Army of the Belorussian Front in the Sarny area later that month. With the army it fought in attacks towards Kovel. For its actions at Kovel the 260th received the honorific Kovel and the Order of the Red Banner. In May it transferred to the army's 129th Rifle Corps. The 260th fought in Operation Bagration between June and August, crossing the Western Bug and participating in the capture of the Warsaw suburb of Praga during the Lublin–Brest Offensive. In December Bulgakov was replaced by Colonel Ivan Popov after the former departed for courses. At the beginning of January 1945 Colonel Yakov Gorshenin replaced Popov. The division fought in the Warsaw–Poznan Offensive of the Vistula–Oder Strategic Offensive from January 1945, distinguishing itself in the capture of Jabłonna, the crossing of the Vistula, and the battle for Warsaw, and the siege of Bromberg. In February, the division transferred to the army's 77th Rifle Corps. On 6 April it received the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class, for its actions. The division went on to fight in the East Pomeranian Offensive and the Berlin Offensive, in the battles for Deutsch-Krone and Schneidemuhl, the crossing of the Oder and the Havel and the capture of Brandenburg. Gorshenin was demoted promoted to deputy corps commander after late April, being replaced by Major General Pyotr Polyakov. The 260th ended the war with the corps in the Berlin Offensive in May. Postwar, the division became part of the Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany with the 129th Rifle Corps, still part of the 47th Army. In early 1946, it was transferred to the 7th Rifle Corps of the 3rd Shock Army. In June 1946, the 260th was withdrawn with the corps to the Moscow Military District, where it was disbanded.

Biography  Carl Tighe was born in Handsworth, Birmingham. His father had emigrated from Ireland just before World War II and his mother was English. He started writing poems and short stories as a teenager, and had some published in Ambit magazine; an influence was J G Ballard and this led to him applying to study English literature at Swansea University where he graduated in 1973. On graduation, he found it difficult to gain permanent employment held a variety of low-paid jobs, including gutting and cleaning fish, working as a Red Coat at Butlin's and lavatory attendant at a mental hospital to get him by. During this time he got an offer to teach English in Poland and went to Wrocław and Gdańsk for two years, taking the train through West and East Germany. He returned to Poland during 1980–81, where he taught at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków and helped monitor foreign radio for Solidarność. Upon returning from Poland, he moved to Cardiff and started freelance writing. He wrote plays for the community theater, articles for magazines, and a history book on Gdańsk to earn a living. He left Wales in 1988 to teach for the extramural department at Manchester University. Tighe also worked as a language teacher, teaching Japanese Students amongst others, and as a script-reader for the BBC. He gained his PhD in 1994 which analysed the responses of Polish literature under and toward Communism. The thesis was partly examined by Norman Davies. He eventually became a lecturer (in 1998), at Derby University where in 2000 he led the first Creative Writing undergraduate degree in the United Kingdom and in 2004 became the first Professor of Creative Writing in the UK. During his career Tighe carried out research into writing in Poland, where he lived for three years, America, and Hungary and presented at conferences as far afield as Italy, Poland, Wales and Turkey. Tighe's particular research interests focus upon Central European literature, culture, politics and history. Subjects have been as diverse as; Gunter Grass, Franz Six, Bret Easton Ellis, Heinrich Boll and Stanislav Lem and he has been published frequently in the Journal of European Studies. A favourite retreat of Tighe's was Rhodes. Tighe died on 8 May 2020 from the coronavirus disease 2019.  Writing career  By the late 1990s he had written numerous plays and books. He had written for BBC Radio 4, Ambit, and many of his essays had appeared in the Journal of European Studies. His first book of short stories “Rejoice” was shortlisted for the Irish Times fiction award and he won the All-London Drama Award, 1988 for his stage play “A Whisper in the Wind. Though he had been writing for sometime publishing a novel eluded him. After sending his novel, based on his time in Poland, to countless publishers and getting continuous rejections Tighe did not think his novel would ever hit the shelves. He had almost lost hope but then a small independent press published the novel which went on to earn nominations and awards. The novel, “Burning Worm,” was shortlisted for Whitbread Award, 2002 and won Authors’ Club Award, 2002.

The Eastern Province Separatist League was a loose political movement of the 19th century Cape Colony. It fought not for independence, but for a separate British-ruled colony in the eastern half of the Cape Colony, with a more restrictive political system and an expansionist policy eastwards against the remaining independent Xhosa states. It was crushed in the 1870s, and many of its members later moved to the new pro-imperialist, Rhodesian “progressive party”. Background For much of the 19th century, the Cape Colony was divided into two main provinces (sometimes known as “circles”) – the Western Province and the Eastern Province. (These entities did not correspond to the modern Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa). The two regions differed in their demographics and their politics. =The two provinces= The larger Western Province had a greater number of Afrikaans- speaking (Coloured and Cape Dutch) voters and was dominated by relatively liberal leaders such as Frank Reitz, William Porter, Saul Solomon, John Molteno and Frank Watermeyer. It tended to favour a more inclusive political system for the colony, and pushed for greater independence from Britain. Its commercial elite also had less material incentive to annex surrounding territory. The smaller Eastern Province was dominated by British frontier settlers who overall advocated a more “vigorous”, expansionist policy against the neighbouring independent Xhosa states, closer ties with the British Empire, and a more closed, restrictive version of the Cape Qualified Franchise, to prevent the anticipated political mobilisation of the – as yet largely voteless – Xhosa majority of the Eastern Province.\\"The Eastern Province members did not like the idea because they were fewer in number than those of the Western Province, and might thus be outvoted in matters connected with the frontier. Besides, it was such a long way to Cape Town that some of the members were not able to attend Parliament very regularly. They also thought something like this: \\"If the British Government do not appoint the Executive, they will not be likely to send out soldiers or to pay for our defence if we have another Kaffir war. They will insist that, if they provide the troops and money, all decisions on these matters ought to rest with them.\\"\\" C.Lewis. Founders and Builders. London : T.C. & E.C. Jack, 1919. pp.162-163. It was led by powerful frontier MPs such as William Matthew Harries, Jock Paterson, William Hume and Robert “Moral Bob” Godlonton. These groupings are generalisations and a great many exceptions existed. Several “eastern” leaders such as Jacobus Sauer, Charles \\"Xolilizwe\\" Stretch and Andries Stockenstrom sided with the “liberal” west; while there were MPs such as Philip Stigant and John Thomas Eustace who formed a powerful conservative minority in the west) =A divided parliament= The resentment which inspired Eastern Province separatism originated as early as 1823, in British settlers’ demands for a greater military presence on the frontier. However, the west- east division was not absolute until it was built into the structures of the Cape's legislature. In the second half of the 1800s, the Cape was run by its own parliament (established 1854), based in Cape Town. The west-east regional division was entrenched in the structure of the parliament itself. The lower house (the Legislative Assembly) was elected from a large number of Districts; however the upper house (the Legislative Council) was elected from only the two Provinces (or “Circles”) – the Western and the Eastern and this dichotomy inevitably caused great polarisation. The lower house of parliament in particular was dominated by MPs from the western province, which was larger and had more voters. Eastern province settlers were far fewer in number, and though they were overrepresented in parliament, by an electoral system that favoured urban areas of the Eastern cape, their representatives were still outnumbered in parliament by those of the far larger west. They therefore felt that their concerns, fears and needs were given little sympathy in this western-dominated body.JL. McCracken: The Cape Parliament. Clarendon Press: Oxford. 1967 History=Early growth and disunity (1823-1857)= The Separatist movement in parliament gradually formed as a loose and informal alliance of settler representatives, who advocated for a separate colony for the Eastern Province. The settler representatives felt that a separate colony, with its own parliament, would allow them to pursue their policies of a higher franchise qualification, expansion eastwards, and a greater Imperial military presence.Kilpin, R.: The Old Cape House, being pages from the history of a legislative assembly. Cape Town: T.M.Miller, 1918. The movement almost immediately fragmented, and continued to coalesce and re-divide throughout its history, due to the regional interests of different towns, and to a range of ideological differences. The largest and most radical faction was based near the eastern frontier, in the town of Grahamstown, and was therefore variously known as \\"the frontier party\\" or \\"the Grahamstown party\\". It was characterised by unusually conservative ideology, as well as an association with the Wesleyan church and the Grahams Town Journal newspaper of Robert Godlonton. A more moderate faction was based in Port Elizabeth and its surrounding towns, where the English commercial elite was more concerned with infrastructure and the opening up of markets, than with the simple annexation of territory. Both factions, and the separatist movement overall, was opposed by the second largest political grouping in the Eastern Cape, which drew its support from the Afrikaans speaking Cape Dutch and Coloured voters, as well as more liberal English colonists. Their greatest support lay in the Graaff Reinet area, and the faction came to be known as the \\"Stockenstromites\\", after the policies of Andries Stockenstrom. There were also disagreements in terms of ideology and policy. Firstly, there was disagreement as to which town should be the future capital and seat of parliament for the proposed colony; smaller Eastern towns feared domination by either Port Elizabeth or Grahamstown (often even more than they resented Cape Town’s domination). Secondly, a region of the eastern province formed its own lobby which agitated for a separate “Midlands” colony. Most importantly, subgroups of the Separatist League put forward other solutions to fight the perceived domination of the Western Province. One such group began a political struggle for a system of three parliaments – one for each province and then one overall parliament for the whole Cape Colony. Another group moderated their demands to merely asking that the current parliament be moved away from Cape Town, to a central location midway between east and west. Another smaller group pushed for parliament to rotate, between Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. While most of the movement continued in their separatist aims, these disagreements weakened the league. The separatists also faced opposition from the growing “responsible government” movement, which was based in the west and advocated greater independence for a united Cape. =Apogee (1857-1870)= The league had a rare moment of unity in 1857 when Robert Godlonton led all eastern members of the Legislative Council in resigning in protest. In 1860, opposition to a new tax on wool led to even greater unity when the most powerful business owners in the Eastern Province's wool industry united in opposition to the tax. The Eastern Province MPs, who constituted a large segment of the aforesaid businessmen, formally institutionalised the movement as the \\"Separatist League\\" later in 1860. The League supporters remained in a minority however. It was only in the 1860s, when it gained imperial support, in the person of conservative British Governor Edmund Wodehouse, that it gained an advantage over the liberal majority. Wodehouse sought to divide the Cape and roll back its legislative independence. Working together with Wodehouse's government, the League reached the apogee of its power. It established an office in Port Elizabeth for their central committee, under permanent secretary Dr W. Way, and a less formal office (the “Eastern Province Club House”) in Cape Town. They briefly operated as a relatively united front, to take advantage of the support from the imperial government. In 1864 they were successful in causing Parliament to be convened in Grahamstown, rather than Cape Town, for the first time. Here, their settler supporters were present in force, and Robert Godlonton's powerful influence on the press helped the League to dominate that year's parliament. Molteno succeeded in rallying the liberals though and eventually prevented the attempts to institutionalise the division. For roughly a decade, the Cape’s political system was in paralysis. Wodehouse sought to impose the league’s proposals, together with various attempts to curtail the independence of the Cape overall, and the responsible government party used its majority to block the proposals and cut off funding to the Governor’s office. After the eventual triumph of the responsible government party in 1871, the Cape received its first elected executive government and several members of the separatist league defected to the responsible government party.WEG Solomon: Saul Solomon, THE member for Cape Town. Oxford University Press. 1948. =Decline (1870-1874)= The eastern province's feeling of neglect, even by the British Governor Bartle Frere, are shown in this 1878 cartoon by the pro- imperialist Lantern newspaper. Observer newspaper. Depicted as the witches of Macbeth are the two main press outlets - the Argus of the western cape represented by Patrick McLoughlin on the right and the Grahamstown Journal of the eastern cape represented by Robert Godlonton on the left (The face of the litigious Godlonton is not shown). In between them is the Cape's anti- confederation Prime Minister John Molteno. Rising prosperity in the early 1870s led to a decline in the separatist movement’s support. Divisions also arose again, between the main towns of the eastern province. However the principal blow to the movement was the new Cape Prime Minister’s bill of 1874 to break up the two-way division of the Cape, into seven new Provinces (the large, uneven number 7 was specifically chosen to encourage fluidity of regional allegiance, to prevent either deadlock, or entrenched divisions). This “Seven Circles Act” removed the political division which had sustained the separatist movement and made its continued existence unsustainable.B.A. Le Cordeur: The politics of eastern Cape separatism, 1820-1854. Oxford University Press. 1981.Wilmot, A. The History of our own Times in South Africa, Volume 2. J.C. Juta & co., 1899. Imperial Emissary James Froude made a brief attempt to resurrect the Separatist League in 1878. At the time, the London Colonial Office was implementing a plan to bring all the states of southern Africa into a single, British-controlled Confederation. The united, independence-oriented Cape had opposed this policy, and it was at the time by far the largest and most powerful state in the region. Creating divisions within the Cape, in the interests of eventually bringing it into the planned Confederation, was therefore a prudent strategy. Froude arrived from London and mobilised the remaining separatists who were still politically active. On behalf of the British government, he promised audiences in Port Elizabeth that if they supported the British Confederation Scheme, the eastern province would be reinstated and given its own colony under Britain, within the planned confederation. The promise came to nothing however, as the Confederation attempt collapsed into wars. One result of the failed confederation attempt was the new political and racial consciousness of the Cape’s Afrikaner population, and the rise of the Afrikaner Bond. Partly because of this, the East-West regional division was replaced with an Anglo-Boer racial division.Malherbe, Vertrees Canby: What They Said, 1795-1910: A Selection of Documents from South African History. Maskew Miller. 1971. Analysis and legacy While the movement occasionally excited great passions on the ground, the dispute was primarily one between political and economic elites. The opinion of the majority of southern Africans on the matter is difficult to gauge, and the political moves towards separation mostly took place within the stifled and regulated environment of the Cape Parliament. Little blood was shed directly for the separatist cause, and incidents of violence were rare. The “Uitenhage bunfight” was one such incident. It occurred during the visit to the Cape Colony of the Imperial Emissary James Anthony Froude. Froude championed the separatists cause and successfully conflated their cause with the Imperial attempt to hold a conference around confederating southern Africa. At a rally in the eastern town of Uitenhage on 21 September 1875, John X. Merriman, the representative of the Cape government, complained of “imperial agitation” and accused the separatists of advocating economic systems that constituted slavery in disguise. After he was pelted with buns and other food stuffs by Jock Paterson and his supporters, the event descended into fist-fights between pro and anti-separatist partisans.AP Newton: Select Documents Relating to the Unification of South Africa. Routledge 2013. p.30AT Wirgman: Storm and Sunshine in South Africa. Longmans, Green and co. 1922. p.58\\"Froude was acclaimed nearly everywhere he went on his speaking tour, but the support he found was not so much for the conference as for his endorsement of pet local causes. Separatists would have separation; the Cape Dutch would have redress for their cousins in the Dutch Republics over Griqualand West; and conservatives would have a strict disciplinary native policy. \\"Chameleon- like, his politics assumed the colour of his surroundings\\", said a Cape Argus editorial. Froude became more confident of the success of his mission when his Lord and Master Carnarvon decided to switch the site of the conference to Natal. That decision contained the threat - empty as it turned out because Natal and the Republics would not play ball - that the Confederation might comprise Natal, Griqualand West and one or both Dutch Republics, leaving the Cape out in the cold. These hardball tactics produced exactly the opposite of their intended effect upon the Molteno Ministry. It became more rabid in its anti-Imperialist stance. John X. Merriman, who had come to accept responsible government and had become Molteno's Commissioner of Crown Lands and Public Works, mounted slashing counter-attacks upon Froude, \\"the Imperial Agent.\\" The rhetoric culminated in the famous bread-roll War. Suffice it to say that, with emotions running very high, it was imprudent for the Mayor of Uitenhage to invite the Imperial Agent to a luncheon in honour of the Minister of Crown Lands and Public Works. As Merriman got warmed up on the subject of Imperial agitation, guests - including Paterson - interrupted the Minister, to the annoyance of his supporters. The culmination was a bombardment of the top table with bread rolls, and fist fights among guests. Merriman's remarks may have been ill-advised and intemperate, but the incident did at least persuade Froude to stop making speeches.\\" Basil T.

Located in Addis Ababa, the prison possibly existed as early as 1923, under the reign of Empress Zewditu, but became notorious after Second Italo-Ethiopian War as the site where Ethiopian intellectuals were detained and killed by Italian Fascists in the Yekatit 12 massacre. After the restoration of Emperor Haile Selassie, the prison remained in use to house Eritrean nationalists and those involved in the Woyane rebellion. Under the Communist Derg regime that followed, the prison was the site of another mass killing, the Massacre of the Sixty, and of the torture and execution of rival groups in the Red Terror. The prison remained a site of human rights abuses until the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front entered Addis Ababa on 28 May 1991, after which it became a normal prison. The prison was closed in 2004 and demolished in 2007 to allow the construction of the headquarters of the African Union. Design Alem Bekagn was constructed along panopticon principles, with 57 cells – each designed for 10 to 20 prisoners – arranged in two tiers around an octagonal courtyard. As the prison population swelled into the thousands, additional huts were constructed around the outside. The site also included a church and a visitation area in the form of two fences placed apart. The prison held both men and women, with the two divided by corrugated iron sheeting. The prison was sometimes known as Akaki Prison, as it sat on the banks of a tributary of the Akaki River, or Kerchele Prison, a phonetic rendering of the Italian term for prison, carcere. Its widely used title of Alem Bekagn, variously translated as \\"farewell to the world\\", \\"end of the world\\" or \\"I have given up on the world\\", likely came about as a result of its courtyard structure, which blocked out everything but the sky. History=Early history and Italian occupation= The construction date of the prison is not known, but it likely began under the Empress Zewditu in 1923 or 1924. Addis Ababa fell to the Italians on 5 May 1936, and the prison was quickly taken over by the Fascist regime to house political prisoners. On 19 February 1937 (Yekatit 12 in the Ethiopian calendar), two Eritreans attempted to assassinate the Viceroy of Italian East Africa, Rodolfo Graziani. Graziani's revenge was swift, and over one thousand people were incarcerated at Alem Bekagn, with many tortured and killed by crushing with ropes. The prison remained in use throughout the Italian occupation, and still contained prisoners when Allied troops liberated Addis Ababa on 6 April 1941. =Restoration of the Ethiopian Empire= The liberation of Addis Ababa saw Emperor Haile Selassie returned to the country. Almost immediately, Selassie faced an uprising in the Tigray Province. The leaders of this revolution, the Woyane, were imprisoned at Alem Bekagn, and following the annexation of Eritrea they were joined by Eritrean nationalists. When the Organisation of African Unity was founded in 1963, its headquarters were located next door to Alem Bekagn. The inner courtyard was visible from the windows of the OAU headquarters, but due to the OAU's policy of non-interventionism, the organisation never condemned the torture and killings at the prison and it would return escapees who claimed refuge in the building. The killings included the execution of 60 ministers under the Derg regime, who were lined up against a wall in full view of the OAU building. =The Derg regime= With so many political prisoners enclosed together, Alem Bekagn radicalised Ethiopian revolutionaries. Following a revolution in February 1974, a Marxist- Leninist military dictatorship known as the Derg rose to power. The Derg arrested the royal family and the imperial government and held them at Alem Bekagn. Many of these were killed in the Massacre of the Sixty on 23 November 1974, including the Prime Ministers Aklilu Habte-Wold and Endalkachew Makonnen and the Ras (Prince) Asrate Kassa. Mengistu Haile Mariam took control of the Derg in 1977, and cemented his position with a campaign of imprisonment and execution known as Qey Shibir or the Ethiopian Red Terror. Many of those arrested in these purges were held at Alem Bekagn, and as many as 10,000 were killed on the site, while overcrowding and unsanitary conditions led to the deaths of more through typhus. =Final years and demolition= The Ethiopian Civil War, which had been running since the rise of the Derg, came to a head with the entry of the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front into Addis Ababa on 28 May 1991. The prison guards fled, and the captives – at that point, mostly Eritrean prisoners of war – freed themselves. The bodies of the Sixty were exhumed from the prison grounds and reburied outside Holy Trinity Cathedral. The prison was closed in 2004, and on the 10th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide that year, plans were presented to the African Union to convert the site into a memorial to human rights abuses. These plans were supported by the Mayor of Addis Ababa Arkebe Oqubay. However, Oqubay was replaced as mayor by Berhane Deressa, who although himself a former prisoner was dedicated to removing traces of the former dictatorships, while the Chinese government offered the AU a gift of a new headquarters on the site. The memorial plans were rejected, and Alem Bekagn was demolished within one day in 2007. Nothing remains of the prison, but the new AU Conference Center and Office Complex has a small memorial to Alem Bekagn in its northern corner.

It is just to the south-east of Leyburn town centre and on the northern side of the A684 road. The parish is relatively new (being raised in 1956) and the church itself was built in 1868 after many years of parishioners having to travel to nearby Wensley ( to the west) to worship. In 2017, permission was granted to allow the parish to remove the pews and enhance car parking around the site, despite some objections to the overall plan. The church celebrated its 150-year anniversary in 2018. History Up until the 16th century, a church had been in existence at Leyburn at a site to the west of town known as Chapel Flatts. When the country converted from Catholicism during the Reformation, the church was downgraded from a place of worship and then converted into a barn. It was later left to ruin and the stones were re- used by local people for houses and walls in the area; as a result, the structure had been completely demolished by the early 1800s. During this time, parishioners were expected to go to services at Holy Trinity Church in Wensley; as a consequence, Leyburn still had a market but no church, which was rare. Historically, Wensley was the settlement of greater importance and had possessed a market since 1202 (Leyburns' was not granted until the 16th century), hence the reason for the main church. After a plague hit Wensley in 1563, most of the survivors left and reduced Wensley to a very small village with a large church. In 1836, a temporary structure was built in Leyburn and this became a daughter church of Holy Trinity Wensley. In 1868, when the church of St Matthew was consecrated, the church still functioned as a chapel of ease to Holy Trinity until 1956 when Leyburn was separated into its own ecclesiastical parish. The records up until 1956 are still combined with the records from the Church of the Holy Trinity in Wensley. The Church of St Matthew lies to the north of the A684 road on the eastern side of Leyburn, and was built on land donated by Lord Bolton. It was designed by Christopher George Wray in a Geometrical styleIt has also been described as being in the decorated Gothic style. with a tower on the west side. The tower displays the only public clock in Leyburn town. The building of the church cost £3,000 and was paid for by public subscription, although the original intent was for a much larger building, but funding was not sufficient enough. A stipulation of the works was that no burials were permitted in the churchyard, and despite one former churchwarden being buried there in 1955, this has been adhered to.The cemetery at Leyburn is just west of the town on the A684 road going towards Wensley. The church is constructed of sandstone and has a hammerbeam roof which is topped off with Welsh slate. The Chancel is by , the nave is by with an aisle and a three-story west facing tower that is square. Apart from some work on the clerestory of the Church of St Anne, Catterick, Wray did not design any other Christian religious buildings, but he did design other notable structures such as The Maritime Museum in Hull and the Palace Hotel in Cairo. The church was consecrated in September 1868 by Bishop Robert Bickersteth but the organ was not completed until May 1870. The building was grade II listed in 1967. There is a plaque on the west wall commemorating Flight Lieutenant Alan Broadley, a Richmondshire born Royal Air Force navigator who was killed on Operation Jericho, the military raid on Amiens Prison in February 1944. In 2016, a £36,000 grant from the Listed Places of Worship Roof Repair Fund, meant that the drainage and associated works on the roof could be carried out. In the same year, plans were announced to remove the pews from the church and install a new glass corridor to an external annexe as part of an upgrade and to make it into a community hub. Despite some public objections, the works received approval from Richmondshire District Council in 2016 and from the Diocese of Leeds in early 2017. In 2018, the church celebrated its 150-year anniversary.

It is a stand-alone sequel to the 1999 film Deep Blue Sea, and stars Danielle Savre, Michael Beach, and Rob Mayes. In the film, a shark conservationist is hired to consult on a top-secret project involving genetically-enhanced bull sharks funded by a pharmaceutical billionaire. However, the highly intelligent super-sharks turn on their masters and begin to pick them off one by one. The film was released direct-to-video on April 17, 2018. Plot Shark conservationist Misty Calhoun is invited to visit the sea-based facility Akhelios by pharmaceutical billionaire Carl Durant. She and neurobiology students Leslie and Daniel Kim are taken to the facility by Durant's associate Craig Burns on a motorboat. When they arrive, they meet Durant, as well as the facility's crew, which include shark trainers Trent Slater, Mike Shutello, and Josh Hooper, and computer technician Aaron Ellroy. As a demonstration, Durant throws Aaron into the water, letting the sharks chase him: at the last possible second, he uses a special device to drive them away in formation. Durant explains that he has been genetically altering the brains of five bull sharks to make them smarter, which renders Misty concerned. The group subsequently convenes in the wet lab, where Durant explains to Misty that the reason he invited her is because the alpha shark, Bella, has been acting strangely, to which Misty concludes is because she is pregnant. Durant is puzzled by this, because her pregnancy did not come up on any tests they ran on her, and Misty theorizes that their genetic alterations hid this. Durant then brings Bella into the wet lab, and has Josh take samples of her saliva, although Bella attempts to bite his arm; he narrowly avoids this. Meanwhile, on the surface, a second shark pushes the motorboat into an electric control box, causing it to explode, and creating significant damage on the surface. This also shuts down some systems within the facility. The sharks then begin flooding the facility and Craig is killed while the others are inside the wet lab. Misty then realizes that Bella went into labor after being dropped back into the pool, and has given birth to a series of shark pups, which previously attacked Craig. Mike attempts to swim to the surface, but one of the sharks knocks him unconscious; Trent rescues him and Misty manages to revive him. As he leans over the pool to gloat at the sharks, one of them beheads him. As a result of a lack of pressure stabilization in the room, the water from the pool pours in, and the group becomes separated, with Leslie knocked unconscious in the flooding; Durant and Daniel both end up alone. Misty and Trent become stranded together, as do Aaron and Josh. Trent reveals to Misty that Durant has been doing the same experiments on himself using a genetics-altering liquid in order to make himself more intelligent, due to his phobia that technology will one day rule the world. Durant reunites with Misty and Trent soon after, and they make their way to an air ventilation shaft that will lead to the surface. Aaron and Josh arrive in one of the sleeping quarters, but the shark pups find them, and kill Josh while Aaron escapes on an air mattress. Misty, Trent, and Durant arrive at the shaft, but Durant locks her out of the room after she attempts to find other survivors, which enrages Trent. The two manage to reach the surface. Meanwhile, Daniel finds Leslie behind a door, and the shark pups kill her in front of him. He is soon found by Aaron, who was attacked by the pups and lost the mattress, and they attempt to find a way to the surface. Misty, meanwhile, uses a blow torch to get inside the room with the ventilation shaft, and is met by Aaron and Daniel. The shark pups then find them, and Misty distracts them while Aaron and Daniel begin climbing to the surface. The water rises as they climb to the surface, which allows the pups to reach Daniel and bisect him while Aaron reaches the surface. Meanwhile, Misty, using scuba gear she found in Trent's quarters, manages to swim to the surface and reunite with the others. Realizing that the facility is sinking, and they cannot stay any longer, the group makes a break for the motorboat. Aaron is dragged underwater by one of the sharks while Durant is confronted by Bella, and seemingly scares her away. However, moments later, Bella jumps up and kills him, while Misty and Trent reach the motorboat and use two flare guns to kill one of the sharks. Aaron then jumps onto the boat, explaining that he escaped one of the sharks. Misty tells Trent that they cannot let the sharks roam in the open ocean, and Trent, explaining that Durant planned for this precise event, blows up the facility with a self-destruct mechanism. Misty, Trent, and Aaron then escape on the motorboat. However, it is soon revealed that Bella and her pups somehow survived the explosion and are now free in the open ocean.

He is one of Spain's most prolific painters, and has received numerous awards including the National Award for Plastic Arts and the Premio Velázquez de las Artes Plásticas. Some of his work is exhibited at the Reina Sofia Museum in Spain. Early life Luis Gordillo was born in 1934 in Seville, Spain and was the second of eight children. He went to law school, but later decided to focus on art, attending the School of Fine Arts in Seville. Career After completing his studies, Gordillo decided to move to Paris in 1958. At the time Spain was a dictatorship under Francisco Franco and art and media were heavily censored. Moving to Paris furthered his art studies in a country where he was free to do so.

Los Gemelos () and El Saladillo () lie in the Calchaqui Valley, close to the towns of La Poma and El Saladillo.

Geology  Los Gemelos consists of three individual vents, the northern two have generated scoria cones the southern features a fissure. The vents have produced about of lava, three from the northern and two from the central vent; lava flows reach the bed of the Calchaqui River and have flowed along its bed, damming the river and forming a lake. El Saladillo consists of two partially eroded cones which have generated lava flows and several smaller cones generated by explosive eruptions.

It was written and produced by Poo Bear and Skrillex. The song was released digitally on February 2, 2018, by Nuyorican Productions and Epic Records. Upon release the song received little promotion other than a post on Instagram and failed to make any impact on the US Billboard Charts. Background and composition In March 2017, Lopez revealed through an Instagram post that she was in the studio with Skrillex and Poo Bear. In the video, she could be heard singing along to the hook \\"could it be us?\\" \\"Us\\" is Lopez's first English single since \\"Ain't Your Mama\\" (2016). The dance-pop song was written and produced by Skrillex and Poo Bear. Describing its composition, David Klemow of the website Dancing Astronaut observed its use of \\"playful vocal chops in the melody and comfortable percussion rhythms.\\" Described as a \\"hopeful love song\\", it features lyrics about longing for more. Lopez revealed that the song is inspired by her relationship with Alex Rodriguez. \\"Us\\" is characterized by a \\"pulsing beat\\", with its chorus being followed by a \\"synth-and-drum-driven breakdown\\". It is performed in the key of G minor with a tempo of 124 beats per minute. Reception Mike Nied of Idolator praised the song's \\"strong vocals and a fiery production\\" and compared it to her 2011 single, \\"On the Floor\\", calling it \\"another massive pop moment\\". Billboard writer Kat Bein observed: \\"It sounds a lot like Skrillex and Poo Bear's previous work, using similar vocal pitch techniques to create counter melodies and a cartoonishly- joyous hook (...) This tune has the island warmth you need to get through the rest of winter.\\" Hugh McIntyre of Fuse described its production as \\"simultaneously odd and alluring\\", writing: \\"Unlike many of her other recent pop efforts, Lopez's vocals soar higher than the music, which is kept decidedly mid-tempo. Whether or not it ends up being one of her biggest hits, 'Us' perfectly defines the superstar's career, while still feeling incredibly fresh and forward-thinking.

The Swedish ice hockey champions () is a title awarded annually to the winning playoff team of the top-tier ice hockey league in Sweden, which currently is Swedish Hockey League (SHL). It was first awarded to IK Göta in 1922, the championship's inaugural year. The championship's present SHL format did not take into effect until the league was originally formed for the 1975–76 season under the name of Elitserien. A team who wins the Swedish Championship is awarded the Le Mat Trophy. Djurgårdens IF holds the most titles in history with 16 titles. The most recent Swedish Champions are Frölunda HC, who won their fourth title in club history in 2016. Before 1953, the Swedish champions were determined through a standalone tournament, the Swedish Ice Hockey Championship, where teams could submit their participation. In other words, the leagues were not connected with the Swedish Championship during this period. Between 1953 and 1955, the winner was decided through matches between the winners of Division 1 Norra and Division 1 Södra. From 1956 to 1965, the Swedish champions was the winner of a second round group stage following Division 1. In the years of 1966 and 1967 a play-off was played between Division 1 teams and the 1968 season saw a return to second round group stage. In the 1975–76 season, Elitserien was started and the winner of Elitserien (later SHL) play-off became Swedish ice hockey champion.

Goodfood reached 200,000 subscribers as of August 2019, an estimated 40% to 45% of the meal kit market. It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker FOOD. Goodfood has evolved from a meal kit focused company to an online grocery and home meal provider. The company offers meal kits, breakfast meals, grocery items, snacks and ready-to- eat products. Goodfood's products are delivered across most of Canada, reaching 95% of the population.  History = Founding Under the Name Culiniste = Goodfood was established in 2014 by Jonathan Ferrari and Neil Cuggy, two former investment banking analysts at RBC Capital Markets, under the original name Culiniste. They were soon joined by Raffi Krikorian. The service grew in popularity and began enrolling hundreds of subscribers per week. One of the Company's early adopters was Anne-Marie Withenshaw, a television and radio personality. Withenshaw eventually endorsed Goodfood and helped it grow in popularity across Quebec and Canada. = Rebranding to Goodfood = In 2016, the company rebranded itself under the name Goodfood. = Going public = In June 2017, Goodfood became publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The transaction, completed through a form of reverse takeover, raised $21 million of capital. The funds raised were earmarked for growth and were used in large part to expand Goodfood's subscriber base and facility size. After the closing of the transaction, Goodfood began trading on the TSX under the ticker FOOD. The Company later raised additional equity to expand to Calgary, a second facility in Montreal and a new facility in Vancouver. Goodfood experienced significant growth after going public: its subscriber base increased 35% to 31,000 in the quarter ending on August 31, 2017, and another 45% to 45,000 in the quarter ending on November 31, 2017.

Its nominal commander was Major Louis D'Aquin, a white man, but its combat commander was Captain Joseph Savary, a free man of color, who had been a Lieutenant-colonel in the French army. The battalion distinguished itself during the American night attack of December 23, 1814, and during the main battle of January 8, 1815. After the battle Andrew Jackson praised the colored soldiers, and especially Captain Savary for their efforts. When the city authorities prohibited colored troops from participating in the victory celebrations, Captain Savary nevertheless led his men in the victory parade through the streets of New Orleans. Background Andrew Jackson issued a proclamation from his headquarters at Mobile, Alabama September 21, 1814, to the free people of color of Louisiana, regretting the United States government's previous neglect of the colored militia, inviting them to participate in the defense of the country, promising everyone who enlisted a bounty of 160 acres of land. He would appoint white officers, but make colored men NCOs. As a result, the old Spanish colonial militia of free men of color reappeared. Two colored battalions and a home guard company were organized.Toledano & Christovich, 2003, p. 96. Organization The second battalion colored battalion organized was Major D'Aquin's Battalion. Its 256 men were recruited from Haitian refugees by Joseph Savary, himself a colored refugee who had served as a lieutenant-colonel in the French Army. They were placed under the command of Major Louis D'Aquin of the 2d Regiment of Louisiana militia, a white refugee from the same island. This second battalion was mustered into United States service December 19, 1814, with Savary as second-in-command with the rank of captain. There were also three other colored officers.Sutherland 2004, vol. 1., pp. 155-156. The battalion was organized with one company of grenadiers, one company of chasseurs, and two companies of foot.\\"Officers and soldiers of the War 1814-1815. from N. O., La., Picayune, August 23, 1908.\\" Southern Historical Society Papers. 2018-01-28. The battles Major D'Aquin's Battalion was positioned in the left center of the right wing of the US line of defense (left-center on the map). On December 23, 1814, British forces reached Mississippi River overland and took the Villeré Plantation where they camped. After nightfall the US forces attacked in two columns, supported by the on the river. Several hours of hard close combat later, the British managed to forward enforcements and turn the encounter into their favor, but the British advance had been delayed enough for Jackson to fortify his line defense behind the Rodriguez Canal.Wiese 2014, p. 14. D'Aquin's Battalion under Captain Savary played a leading role in the engagement, the captain encouraging his men forward with the words \\"March on! March on my friends, march on against the enemies of the country\\" in Haitian French.Gates & Appiah 2005, vol. 4, p. 690. During the actual battle, January 8, 1815, the battalion, with an effective strength of about 150 men, also was under the command of Captain Savary. It was stationed in the left center of the right wing of the US line of defense. To the right of them was Major Plauchés battalion of free men of color; to the left, 350 men from the 44th US Infantry.Kanon 2014, p. 164. During the battle, the battalion made an unauthorized attack reaching the advancing British lines. Jackson always believed that the British commander, Sir Edward Pakenham, who fell in the battle, was killed by fire from a free man of color.Reef 2010, p. 204. Aftermath After the battle Jackson praised the two colored battalions, stating they had not \\"disappointed the hopes that had been formed of their courage and perseverance.\\" Salter 2003, p. 21. Jackson specifically emphasized Captain Savary as worthy of commendation. Yet the general assigned the colored battalions to do fatigue works the white troops refused to do. Captain Savary, however, refused to let his men perform menial tasks, which were under the dignity of the white troops.Aslakson 2014, pp. 94, 96. When the city authorities prohibited colored troops from participating in the victory celebrations, Captain Savary nevertheless led his men in the victory parade through the streets of New Orleans.Tucker 2012, p. 6. On direct order from Jackson, the colored soldiers received the pay and bounty promised them, but the government in Washington refused to act on the land grant of 160 acres also vowed by the general.Sutherland 2004, vol. 1., pp. 155.

Ballaghaneo is now the townland of Ballaghanea in Lurgan Parish, County Cavan, on the shores of Lough Ramor, so the O'Reillys were removed a long way from their home by the Plantation. Hugh Reyly was the great-grandnephew of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Eoghan na Fésóige mac Seoain, who ruled from 1418–1449. The O’Reilly lands in Arderry were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows- The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as Captain Payne and the tenant as Cormuck McBrian.

As a two-year-old in 1921 she showed considerable promise by winning four of her six starts. In the following year she was one of the best fillies of her generation as she won the Epsom Oaks, Coronation Stakes and Newmarket Oaks and finished second on three other occasions. She made very little impact as a broodmare and died in 1933. Background Pogrom was a bay mare bred in the United Kingdom by her owner Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor. She was sent into training with Alec Taylor, Jr. at his stable at Manton, Wiltshire. She was one of the best horses sired by Lemberg, whose wins included the Epsom Derby, Eclipse Stakes and Champion Stakes. Pogrom's performances helped Lemberg to become Britain’s Champion sire in 1922. Her dam Popingaol won two minor races but became a very successful broodmare whose other foals included Book Law (St Leger), Splendid Jay (Yorkshire Oaks), Book Debt (dam of Pay Up) and Fair Cop (female-line ancestor of Provoke). Racing career=1921: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old in 1921,Pogrom won four times from six races. Her victories came in the Astley Stakes at Lewes, the Michaelmas Plate at Manchester, the Buckenham Stakes at Newmarket and the Great Sapling Stakes at Sandown Park. She also finished second to the colt Sicyon in the Prendergast Stakes at Newmarket in mid-October. =1922: three-year-old season= Pogrom began her second season by finishing second in the Lingfield Oaks in May. On 2 June at Epsom Racecourse, Pogrom was one of eleven fillies to contest the 144th running Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles the 5/4 favourite ahead of Soubriquet and Silver Urn, respectively second and first in the 1000 Guineas. Ridden by Ted Gardner, he raced in third place before taking the lead in the straight and winning \\"very comfortably\\" by three quarters of a length from Soubriquet with three lengths back to Mysia in third. Pogrom was dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 14 June in which she was ridden by the Australian jockey Bernard \\"Brownie\\" Carslake and won at odds of 2/1. In early July she ran well in defeat when assigned a weight of 133 pounds for the Sandringahm Stakes at Sandown Park, coming home two lengths second to a colt named Prestongrange, who was carrying 18 pounds less. She was then scheduled to run in the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse but was withdrawn on the day of the race after being found to be \\"slightly amiss\\". After a two-month break, Pogrom was stepped up in trip for the fourteen furlong Newmarket Oaks and finished in a dea heat with Abe Bailey's filly Bessema, to whom she was conceding 17 pounds in weight. Shortly afterwards she reappeared at Lingfield Park but was beaten by her stablemate Leighton Tor. By the end of the season, Pogrom had earned £11,747, making her the fourth biggest prize money winner in Britain that year behind Royal Lancer, Golden Myth and Captain Cuttle. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Pogrom an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks. Press reports stated the British three-year-old fillies of 1922 were regarded as an exceptionally strong crop, and that Pogrom was probably the best of them. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Pogrom was retired to become a broodmare. She proved difficult to breed from and produced very few foals before being euthanised in 1933. One foal, a chestnut colt named Scatter (foaled 1925, by Hurry On) became a successful breeding stallion in Jamaica. Pedigree * Pogrom was inbred 4 × 4 to Isonomy, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

It operates in line with 2030 Agenda, under the vision of “Ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture”. SIANI's mission is to facilitate inclusive and engaging dialogues around Sustainable Development Goal #2, with participation from academia, the private sector, public authorities and civil society.https://www.government.se/49f428/contentassets/400a118a14b94750a61e42b620a9def9/sweden- and-the-2030-agenda--report-to-the-un-high-level-political-forum-2017-on- sustainable-development.pdf SIANI seeks to generate impact by: * creating opportunities for evidence-based, gender-balanced dialogues * making knowledge available for informed decision-making in local, national and international arenas, and * facilitating cross-sector, multi-stakeholder, joint action. Launched in 2009 with core funding from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and hosted by the Stockholm Environment Institute, (SEI) SIANI provides an open, interactive and neutral platform for multi-sector engagement and dialogue. SIANI seeks to improve sustainability and gender equality, but does not take any ideological stance and does not lobby for any particular farming method or practice. Individual members are welcome to express their opinions through SIANI activities and media. SIANI strives for gender balance and multi-stakeholder representation in its operation and activities.  History  SIANI work initiated at the consultative workshop in 2008, where a wide range of stakeholders discussed a noted lack of attention given to agriculture's role in sustainable development, both within Sweden and internationally. It was argued that a lot of agricultural expertise existed amongst the Swedish resource base, but that this expertise was not used to its full potential. This led to the launch of SIANI in 2010, with the goal of establishing a platform for cross-sectoral knowledge exchange about agriculture, food and rural development. Since then, SIANI has been working on awareness raising and knowledge production and exchange about the critical role of agriculture for sustainable development. Since then SIANI has proceeded to other development phases: Phase 2 (2013-2016) was centered on network expansion and consolidation. That is when the SIANI platform anchored its position as a facilitator of choice for anyone who works with and is interested in sustainable agriculture, food security and nutrition, particularly in low-income countries. In the spring of 2016, an external evaluation concluded that the SIANI network should no longer be seen as an initiative, but rather as a long-term investment aimed at tackling issues of poverty reduction, food security and sustainable agricultural development. In January 2016, SIANI entered phase 3 (2016-2020). To better reflect the 2030 Agenda it was determined that SIANI will focus and orient its actions on SDG2: Zero Hunger.  Vision/Goal  SIANI's vision is to promote knowledge-sharing, dialogue and collaboration to advance sustainable agriculture for food security, improved nutrition and the eradication of hunger.  Governing Body = Steering Committee = The SIANI Steering Committee is responsible for the strategic development of the SIANI network, making the major decisions concerning SIANI's general objectives, planning and program, and on issues of major importance regarding the organization, finances, administration and information activities. The SIANI board is made up of a minimum of five and a maximum of ten members who must collectively comprise a broad and varied experience and expertise in aspects of international agricultural development. The Swedish Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) are permanent members and can participate in debates, comment, and ask questions, but have no right to vote when decisions are made, with the exception of cases where full consensus is required.  Executive Body - The Secretariat  The responsibility for the day-to-day functioning and financial management of SIANI as well as developing, coordinating and stimulating the network is carried out by the SIANI Secretariat. The secretariat is hosted by the Headquarters of the Stockholm Environment Institute in Stockholm.  Membership  SIANI membership is free and open to all interested individuals working on issues of agriculture and food security and registered via the SIANI website. SIANI's membership base is primarily academics from Sweden but is open to anyone, and members can be found in both of the Americas, Africa and Asia. There are also a number of members from civil society organizations, government agencies and the private sector. Members have an opportunity to contribute to the formation of the annual work plan through the annual members’ meeting.  Impact  In collaboration with partners SIANI has built a robust body of work and the network has a broad global outreach. Among other things, supporting Swedish work on antimicrobial resistance, initiated a strategy for developing urban agroforestry work in Gothenburg, and helped to create the Agroforestry Network. SIANI raised the issue of food waste with its implications for global food chains, and highlighted that social protection systems have a greater impact if they are designed with a food and nutrition perspective in mind. The SIANI event about soils in Malmöhttps://www.siani.se/event/sossoil/ created interest among government officials and led to a request for training of decision-makers in southern Sweden.

Early life The daughter of Frances Louise Gollinger and William Bertram Gollinger, Williams was born Aileen Gollinger in Toronto and educated at Duke of York Public School and Northern Secondary School. She attended the First Baptist Church in Toronto, and often attended events at the Universal Negro Improvement Association Hall (UNIA) during her teenage years. Career In 1940, Williams joined as a member of the Dilettantes (later known as Canadian Negro Women's Association), a social club of Black women in Toronto. Along with Kay Livingstone and Phyllis Simmons Brooks, Williams was instrumental in reshaping the group to form the Canadian Women's Negro Club (later Association), CANEWA, which focused on addressing social problems and establishing scholarships and bursaries in support of Black youth. She also worked closely with Penny Hodge. She served as secretary for a number of years and as president on two occasions, 1953-1954 and 1973-1974. In 1973 she played a crucial role in organizing the first meeting of the National Congress of Black Women of Canada (NCBWC), which was held at the Westbury Hotel in Toronto. It took place after 18 months of planning and saw 200 black women in attendance including representation from the Coloured Women's Club (Montreal), the Negro Women's Professional Club (Halifax), the Grand Order of the Eastern Star (Toronto), amongst others all to focus on \\"a serious consideration of the issues vital to the Black community.\\" Williams was actively involved in the Ontario Black History Society, serving as its vice-president in the 1980s. In addition to her volunteer work, Williams held jobs at a number of companies and government organizations including Simpson's department store in Toronto, Metro-Goldwyn Mayer Pictures of Canada, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Ontario Ministry of Revenue. Aileen Williams was presented with an Ontario Senior Achievement Award in 2008. When speaking to The Toronto Observer at the event, William's said in regard to African Canadians living in Toronto in 1940, “We never used to have any voice back then,” she said. “Things have improved a lot.” She died in Mississauga on August 31, 2015.

Norman Tindale's estimate of Kungadutji tribal lands assigns them something in the range of 2,800 sq- miles. They were one of the Channel Country peoples associated with the Cooper Creek river system, and lay to the north of Durham Downs. Their eastern limits were around Mount Howitt and Kyabra Creek. Their northwesterly frontiers lay in proximity of Lake Yamma Yamma. Neighbouring tribes were the Kuungkari, Bidia and Kulumali. History of contact White settlers began to occupy Kungadutji lands between 1874 and 1878, together with those of the neighbouring Kuungkari and Bidia. The combined population of these three groups in the period of first contacts was estimated to be around 1,200 people.

Its aims include a commitment \\"to strengthen the party in its opposition to all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism... to uphold the right of supporters of justice for Palestinians to engage in solidarity activities\\" and \\"to oppose attempts to widen the definition of antisemitism beyond its meaning of hostility towards, or discrimination against, Jews as Jews\\". Launch JVL was inaugurated in July 2017, and Jenny Manson, an activist in Jews for Justice for Palestinians and former Labour councillor, was elected chair. The organisation was officially launched on 24 September, on the second day of the Labour Party Conference in Brighton, with over 300 people in attendance, according to JVL. The launch featured historian and Oxford University professor of international relations Professor Avi Shlaim, former Court of Appeal judge Sir Stephen Sedley, and the Jewish Socialist Group's David Rosenberg. Purposes JVL describes itself as a \\"network for Jewish members of the Labour Party\\" which \\"stand for rights and justice for Jewish people everywhere and against wrongs and injustice to Palestinians and other oppressed people anywhere\\". The organisation's founding statement advocated \\"making the Labour Party an open, democratic and inclusive party, encouraging all ethnic groups and cultures to join and participate freely\\" and to support a commitment \\"to strengthen the party in its opposition to all forms of racism, including antisemitism\\". Its aims were set out in a statement of principles, which include a commitment \\"to strengthen the party in its opposition to all forms of racism, including antisemitism, to uphold the right of supporters of justice for Palestinians to engage in solidarity activities\\" and \\"to oppose attempts to widen the definition of antisemitism beyond its meaning of hostility towards, or discrimination against, Jews as Jews\\". Although JVL has been described as \\"anti-Zionist\\", Manson has said the organisation is \\"not anti-Zionist\\" but stated that it was \\"an alternative voice for Jewish members of Labour\\" who do not support the Jewish Labour Movement's (JLM) \\"profoundly Zionist orientation\\". JVL's information officer Jonathan Rosenhead shares the latter opinion. The organisation's Secretary, Glyn Secker, wrote that JVL has \\"established a very different, authentic, radical, and socialist Jewish narrative to that promulgated by the Jewish Labour Movement and Labour Friends of Israel\\". Wimborne-Idrissi wrote that one of JVL's roles \\"is to clarify the distinction between Jew, Israeli and Zionist so that people are less likely to fall into antisemitic generalisation when talking about Israel's role in Palestine\\", to offer \\"an alternative to the JLM's pro-Israel agenda\\" and \\"...we do not believe it has the right to speak as the Jewish Labour Movement on behalf of all Jews in the Labour party.\\" Co- Chairs Jenny Manson and Leah Levane \\"contend that the JLM cannot represent all Jewish members of the Labour Party when it is committed 'to promote the centrality of Israel in Jewish life' as well as the wider Jerusalem Programme of the World Zionist Organization.\\" The organisation's motto is \\"Always with the oppressed; never with the oppressor\\" which paraphrases a quote by Marek Edelman, the last surviving commander of the Warsaw Uprising. Membership JVL only admits full membership to Labour Party members who identify as Jewish. In August 2019, JVL said that it had full members in a quarter of constituency Labour parties. All other members are associate members without voting rights, as the constitution specifies that the organisation is led by Jewish people and only they can vote on its policies. JVL does not make promoting the centrality of Israel to Jewish life a condition of membership\\" which is a requirement for membership of the JLM. Committee member Ian Saville has clarified that \\"There is no ideological test to join\\" and it is \\"a group for Jews in the Labour Party that would welcome all Jews, whatever their attitude to Israel\\". Affiliations JVL's media officer Naomi Wimborne- Idrissi has said the organisation's \\"longer term aim\\" could be to affiliate to Labour. Several constituency Labour parties have affiliated to JVL. The organisation has been endorsed by leaders of Labour-affiliated trade unions, namely Len McCluskey, General Secretary of Unite the Union; and Tosh McDonald, president of ASLEF. JVL is affiliated to both the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy (CLPD) and the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance (CLGA). The organisation has additionally formed a coalition with Red Labour and the Labour Representation Committee, both of which are also members of the CLGA. JVL was reported by The Times of Israel in December 2017 to be closely linked to Free Speech on Israel (FSOI) which was founded in 2016, is non-Zionist and opposes the notion that anti-Zionism is antisemitism. However, Wimborne- Idrissi rejected this claim, saying they are \\"two separate organizations with different aims and objectives.\\" Views Len McCluskey called the formation of JVL a \\"positive move forward\\". David Rosenberg, author and founding member of the Jewish Socialists' Group, described JVL as \\"a broader, more inclusive, more open-minded group — not fixated on defending Israel...\\". Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn has said JVL are \\"committed to fighting anti-Semitism and making sure there is a Jewish voice in the party. We already have the Jewish Labour Movement. JVL was established last year and I think it is good that we have organisations within the party that are giving that voice to people.\\" Writer Richard Seymour described the organisation as \\"rooted in radical and revolutionary internationalism\\". Stephen Sedley stated that \\"...pro-Israeli groups such as the Jewish Labour Movement [are] seeking to drive out pro-Palestinian groups like the Jewish Voice for Labour by stigmatising them...\\" The organisation has been described as controversial and the Jewish Labour Movement has called its views an \\"extreme fringe\\". Jewish Leadership Council chairman Jonathan Goldstein has said that JVL is \\"not representative of our community\\". Board of Deputies of British Jews President Marie van der Zyl has referred to JVL as \\"a tiny organisation whose odious views are representative of no-one but themselves.\\" Jon Lansman, founder of Momentum, stated that JVL \\"is an organisation which is not just tiny but has no real connection with the Jewish community at all\\" and \\"It doesn't represent the Jewish community in a way that JLM clearly does represent the Labour wing of the Jewish community.\\" Luke Akehust, director of We Believe in Israel and secretary of Labour First, has called for JVL to be proscribed. History JVL has defended former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, supported Jackie Walker as being a victim of a \\"vituperative campaign... based on this sliver of quasi-fact\\", deemed accusations of antisemitism against Moshé Machover as \\"ill founded\\", opposed and condemned the expulsion of Marc Wadsworth as being \\"punished in advance of investigation and hearing of the case\\", welcomed the lifting of Derby North MP Chris Williamson's suspension and called the National Executive Committee's ruling not to endorse him as a Labour candidate for the 2019 general election a \\"dangerous development for everyone who stands for justice for Palestinians and for democracy and freedom of expression in Britain, including within Labour.\\" =2017= At the 2017 Labour Conference, JVL supported Hastings and Rye Constituency Labour Party's proposal to change the Labour Party Rule Book to add a clause which makes it clear that antisemitism will not be tolerated, whilst clarifying that \\"hatred of Jews shall not be evidenced by non-abusive words or actions regarding Israel or zionism that are part of legitimate political discourse.\\" The organisation opposed the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's Working Definition of Antisemitism being formally adopted by the Labour Party for disciplinary purposes at the 2017 Conference, which it sees as \\"attempts to widen the definition of antisemitism beyond its meaning of hostility towards, or discrimination against, Jews as Jews\\". JVL sees the rule change, supported by Jeremy Corbyn, as an \\"anti-democratic restriction on political debate\\". =2018= JVL has challenged \\"unjustified allegations of antisemitism\\" which are \\"used to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's leadership\\". In March 2018, JVL organised a smaller counter-demonstration, attended by around 30 people, according to The Independent, at a protest against antisemitism in the Labour Party, held in Parliament Square, London. In a statement, JVL said it was \\"appalled\\" by the Board of Deputies of British Jews' letter and that \\"They do not represent us or the great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyn's vision for social justice and fairness. Jeremy's consistent commitment to anti-racism is all the more needed now.\\" Chair of JVL, Jenny Manson defended Corbyn on BBC's Daily Politics, saying he had taken \\"enormously strong action\\" to deal with the issue in his party. In April, Manson appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, and, referring to a survey conducted by the Campaign Against Antisemitism said: \\"Evidence, including very recent evidence, commissioned by a Jewish body suggests the very worst antisemitism is still on the right, on the far right and always has been\\". In the same month, JVL issued a statement saying they \\"strongly condemn the Israeli army's violent response to the Land Day demonstration in Gaza, killing 15 Palestinian civilians and wounding hundreds more\\" and called \\"for an unconditional end to Israel's inhuman siege of Gaza and its brutal occupation of the West Bank which has destroyed the lives of generations of Palestinians.\\" In May, JVL with members of Free Speech on Israel produced a definition of antisemitism as: > \\"Antisemitism is a form of racism: hatred, hostility, discrimination or > prejudice against Jews because they are Jews. It may be manifested in > violence; denial of rights; direct, indirect or institutional > discrimination; prejudice-based behaviour; or verbal or written statements. > Such manifestations draw on stereotypes – characteristics which all Jews are > presumed to share.\\" In July, JVL said of Labour's code of conduct (that defines antisemitism which was adopted by the National Executive Committee (NEC) for the purposes of disciplinary cases brought before the National Constitutional Committee) \\"offers a constructive framework for moving forward in this difficult area\\" and it encouraged \\"free speech on issues to do with Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians, and with Zionism\\" but \\"much will depend on how this code of conduct is applied in practice, particularly in disciplinary cases. We are cautiously optimistic.\\" In the same month, the organisation was one of 41 Jewish organisations in 15 countries, including six in the UK, criticising the IHRA definition. In August, the organisation called for support of Labour's existing code of conduct and for the NEC to resist adopting the IHRA examples of antisemitism as it fell short of providing \\"a clear and unambiguous statement based on attitudes to Jews as Jews, not attitudes to a country, Israel\\". In the same month, JVL asked its members for help in delivering an \\"expanded programme\\" of antisemitism training to party members in response to what it called a \\"growing number of requests\\". In August, JVL complained to BBC Director-General Tony Hall and the BBC's news and current affairs director Francesca Unsworth about the broadcaster's \\"lack of impartiality and inaccuracies\\" and \\"biased\\" coverage of Labour MP Margaret Hodge's allegations of antisemitism against Jeremy Corbyn. In September, JVL and Free Speech on Israel published a joint declaration on antisemitic misconduct. JVL contributed to the consultation on Labour's code of conduct by rejecting suggestions that comparisons between Israel and \\"features of pre-war Nazi Germany\\" or apartheid-era South Africa were \\"inherently antisemitic\\", arguing that \\"Drawing such parallels can undoubtedly cause offence; but potent historical events and experiences are always key reference points in political debate. Such comparisons are only anti-Semitic if they show prejudice, hostility or hatred against Jews as Jews.\\" Their guidelines on antisemitism included the view that \\"Jews, Israelis and Zionists are separate categories that are too frequently conflated by both supporters and critics of Israel. This conflation can be anti-Semitic. Holding all Jews responsible for the actions of the Israeli government is anti-Semitic. Many Jews are not Zionist.\\" The organisation also suggested that \\"discussion and education, rather than a formal disciplinary approach\\" could be more appropriate in some cases of antisemitism. In September, at the Labour Party Conference, JVL hosted two fringe events: \\"Israel/Palestine: Antisemitism\\" and \\"Fighting The Far Right\\". JVL also organised and hosted the premiere of the documentary film The Political Lynching of Jackie Walker, from which 200 people were evacuated after a bomb threat. In a statement, the organisation said the film \\"is an incisive and chilling exposé of attempts to silence critics of Israel, in particular those who support the socialist project of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. It connects the global struggle against racism and the far right with the Palestinian cause.\\" =2019= In February 2019, over 200 Jewish members and supporters of Labour signed a JVL open letter calling the party under Corbyn an \\"a crucial ally in the fight against bigotry and reaction\\" and noted Corbyn's consistent campaigning in support of \\"initiatives against antisemitism\\". They also welcomed Labour's support for \\"freedom of expression on Israel and on the rights of Palestinians\\". They felt that there was a \\"disproportionate focus on antisemitism on the left, which is abhorrent but relatively rare.\\" The signatories included Prof David Epstein, Mike Leigh, Prof Michael Rosen, Prof Avi Shlaim, Gillian Slovo, Prof Annabelle Sreberny, Walter Wolfgang, Peter Buckman, Erica Burman, Keith Burstein, Miriam David, Michael Ellman, Nick Foster, Susan Himmelweit, Selma James, Ann Jungman, Frank Land, Gillian McCall, Helen Pearson and Ian Saville. In July, JVL criticised BBC Panorama documentary Is Labour Anti-Semitic?. In a statement, the organisation said: \\"It is shameful that the BBC has joined in an orchestrated campaign whose principal aim is quite clearly to prevent Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister of a Labour government committed to socialism.\\" In August, JVL welcomed the investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into the handling of antisemitism by the Labour Party. The organisation submitted a dossier in response to the EHRC's request for evidence. JVL held that, by failing to make public the initial complaints they received justifying the investigation and Labour's initial response to the EHRC, the EHRC have violated the Equality Act 2006 which requires that they specify who is being investigated and \\"the nature of the unlawful act\\" they are suspected of committing, both required by its own terms of reference. Signatories to JVL's letter included Oxford University professor Avi Shlaim and human rights lawyer Sir Geoffrey Bindman QC. In the same month, JVL claimed that \\"pressure was put on organisers\\" after the Greenbelt Festival withdrew an invitation to one of its co-chairs, Leah Levane, to sit on a panel. The Festival said that it \\"must make it clear that Leah was not coming as a representative or spokesperson for the Jewish community in the UK\\". Similar venue denying campaigns have been mounted against Jackie Walker, Chris Williamson and Labour Against the Witchhunt. In September, at the Labour Party Conference, JVL organised a fringe \\"Let's Talk About Palestine\\" fringe event attended by 200 people at the Mercure Hotel featuring JVL's political officer Graham Bash, Israeli historian Professor Ilan Pappé and former Palestinian Knesset member Haneen Zoabi. In October, JVL commended the definition of antisemitism issued by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Community Security Trust which is that \\"an antisemitic incident is any malicious act aimed at Jewish people, organisations or property, where there is evidence that the incident has antisemitic motivation or content, or that the victim was targeted because they are (or are believed to be) Jewish.\\" In August, JVL complained to BBC Director-General Tony Hall and the BBC's news and current affairs director Francesca Unsworth about the broadcaster's \\"lack of impartiality and inaccuracies\\" and \\"biased\\" coverage of Labour MP Margaret Hodge's allegations of antisemitism against Jeremy Corbyn. In December, in a letter to BBC director-general Tony Hall and director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth, JVL said: \\"In the closing stages of an acrimonious election campaign, the BBC’s coverage of anti-semitism charges against the Labour Party has been both unbalanced and uncritical.\\" =2020= In January, in a public letter to the Labour Party leadership candidates, JVL expressed concerns over the impact of the Board of Deputies of British Jews's 10-point pledge \\"to tackle the anti-semitism crisis\\" on Labour's independence and ability to show solidarity with Palestine. JVL expressed fears that the pledges will silence any criticism of Israel and reverse steps made under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership towards a progressive foreign policy. In February, the Board of Deputies of British Jews (BOD) was accused of defending the occupation of Palestine after it condemned the United Nations for listing companies linked to illegal Israeli settlements. JVL also criticised the BOD, arguing that it \\"will do anything it possibly can to divert attention from the reality of the occupation.\\" In February, JVL accused Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) of disproportionately targeting Labour over other political parties. In April, in a joint statement with the Labour Representation Committee and Red Labour, JVL said that Keir Starmer being elected Labour leader is \\"a worrying outcome\\" for those inspired by Corbyn's vision as there are indications \\"to marginalise, if not drive out, the left\\". Two days later, JVL said it hopes Starmer will \\"extend the same courtesy to Jews like us: active party members who take a different political view\\". The following week, JVL released a joint statement with Red Labour and the Labour Representation Committee based on the message of a unified grassroots coalition called 'Don't Leave, Organise'. The initiative is supported by the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers' Union, former Labour MP Laura Pidcock and retired Aslef president Tosh McDonald among others. Their statement urges socialists to remain in the Labour Party, \\"contribute to the efforts to re-unite the left, and be part of a renewed focus for mobilising to demand the society we need for the many\\". and that \\"...any genuine coalition of the left should include both traditional established organisations and emerging new groupings.\\" In May, according to analysis by JVL of more than 150 claims that Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) included in a submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in December in response to EHRC's investigation into institutional antisemitism in the Labour Party, claims submitted to a probe into alleged antisemitism within the Labour Party are based on \\"prejudiced gossip, distortion, double standards and presumed guilt without investigation\\" and that evidence sent by the JLM to the EHRC is \\"largely worthless\\" as it \\"misstates facts and draws false conclusions.\\" The executive summary of the analysis states that many of the claims are \\"simply rumour and gossip, or unsubstantiated allegations.\\" JVL also pointed to the Labour Party's Governance and Legal Unit report leaked in April, saying that its content \\"further undermines\\" allegations that Corbyn's team were negligent in efforts to handle allegations of antisemitism within the party and that \\"procedural failings [were] unjustifiably attributed to anti-semitic bias.\\" In July, JVL supported protests against Israel's plans to illegally annex land in West Bank. In the same month, JVL described the promise to pay an estimated £500,000 in damages from subscription payments of Labour party members to former senior staffers who claimed defamation following a BBC Panorama investigation into allegations of anti-semitism within Labour despite receiving legal advice that it would win the case as \\"deeply disappointing\\". In August, in response to General Secretary of the Labour Party David Evans ordering Labour branches and constituency parties not to discuss investigations into antisemitism, a related libel settlement and the adoption of International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's Working Definition of Antisemitism, JVL said \\"there is nothing illegitimate\\" in members seeking to debate the differing views that are widespread at all levels of the party and called \\"on the general secretary to withdraw this draconian attempt to silence the membership by forbidding legitimate and necessary debate on important matters of concern to us all.\\" See also *Independent Jewish Voices *Jewdas *Jewish Labour Movement *Jewish Socialists' Group *Socialist society (Labour Party) ReferencesExternal links * 2017 establishments in the United Kingdom Organizations established in 2017 Jewish political organizations Jewish organisations based in the United Kingdom Opposition to antisemitism in Europe Non-governmental organizations involved in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict Organisations associated with the Labour Party (UK) ","title":"Jewish Voice for Labour"},{"id":"56468998","title":"There Is More"},{"id":"56469020","text":"Johann Gottfried Teske (-) was a Prussian physicist and philosopher who is best known for his collaboration with Immanuel Kant on his work De Igne. Life Teske studied from 1719 at the University of Königsberg. He later moved to the University of Halle, where on 27 May 1726 he acquired a master's degree. He returned to the University of Königsberg on 10 August 1726 where he became a lecturer of philosophy. In 1728 he became an associate professor of logic and metaphysics and in 1729 a full professor of physics. In 1733 he was appointed to the Samland Konsistorialrat. He also became Vice President and Official at the Consistory. In 1760 he received an honorary professorship at the University of St. Petersburg as an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Teske's most famous pupil was Immanuel Kant, whom he accompanied as a mentor in acquiring a master's degree and assisted in his script on the fire (de igne). Teske, who was the first physicist at the University of Königsberg, was involved in the study of electricity. He also participated in the organizational tasks of Königsberg University.

She is recognized for her testimony in the 1967 Commission of Enquiry into the corruption surrounding the granting of gas station licenses. Miles' testimony resulted in the firing of the Senior Factory Inspector. She is considered to be a strong figure of the resistance to governmental corruption and the Commission at which she testified is seen as one of the most significant in the history of Trinidad and Tobago.  Early life  Gene Miles was born in Port of Spain in 1930 to Ruby and Randolph Miles. In 1947 the family moved to Glencoe, a quiet middle-class neighbourhood on the North Western Peninsula of Trinidad. Gene attended Sacred Heart primary school before attending high school at St. Joseph's Convent, Port of Spain. After graduating from high school, Gene joined the civil service at the Ministry of Education and Culture. In 1962 she was transferred to the Ministry of Petroleum and Mines, and then to the Factory Inspectorate under the Labour Department as First Class Clerk.  Commission of Enquiry  The Commission of Enquiry into the Circumstances Surrounding the Sales, Leases and Other Transfers of Gasolene Stations or Sites for Gasolene Stations since 1961 and the Procedure Followed in the Granting of Licenses for the Operation of Such Stations was appointed on 23 June 1966. The Commission was headed by Mr. Justice Karl de la Bastide and tasked with investigating the sales and leases of gasolene stations. During the period investigated by the Commission, BP Caribbean entered the Petroleum Marketing Industry of Trinidad and Tobago and the government contemplated stricter measures for the granting of licenses under Section 17 of the Petroleum Ordinance 26 No. 2. Additionally, a Senior Factory Inspector with sole discretion in the granting of station licenses was appointed. As a result, petroleum dealers, began to speculate in gasolene station sites. This speculation was heavily financed by petroleum marketing companies that could not plausibly recover their investment but enjoyed a generous tax deduction known as a \\"submarine well allowance\\" to offset the cost. As a result, the government incentives offered to encourage offshore oil production were being used to subsidize investment in unprofitable gasolene stations and station sites. The Factory Inspectorate assumed responsibility for the administration of the Petroleum Ordinance 26 No. 2 in 1948. At the time of the expiration of licenses at the end of the calendar year, regulations required that applications, including a fee, be made to the Senior Factory Inspector. Between 1961 and 1963 there was an uncontrolled increase in the number of gasolene station licenses issued that resulted in the unsafe clustering of gasolene stations. During the same period the Senior Factory Inspector, Mr. Kenneth Tam, adopted a new policy of approving licenses by site rather than applicant name. As a result, several individuals applied for and received approval to operate on the same site. The new policy also did not require that applicant to hold legal titles to the site before applying. = Testimony = In her testimony to the Commission, Gene Miles used her position as a clerical officer to name and accuse senior officials in the Department of the Senior Factory Inspector of wrongdoing. According to her testimony, she had refused to show confidential documents to oil company officials, as instructed by her superiors. She alleged that she had overheard a conversation in which a woman asked the Chief Factory Inspector Kenneth Tam, if he had received the two documents and that he looked confused when he saw that she had heard. She claimed to have found discrepancies between the official plans for the gas station sites and the register of applications, suggesting corruption in the application process. = Report = According to the report Gene Miles, the Clerical Officer in the Department of the Senior Factory Inspector, testified that the senior inspector Kenneth Tam, had been dishonest in his practices. She claimed that as a result of her testimony, Tam had retaliated against her by giving her a poor confidential report, causing her annual increments to be withheld. The reprisals ultimately led to her transfer from the department. According to the Commissioner, Miles' allegations were not contradicted and appeared to be supported by Public Service Regulations. According to the Commission, Kenneth Tam admitted that his report might have contributed to the cessation of the increments. The Commission noted that these events occurred simultaneously the testimony Miss Miles’ testimony against Mr Tam and that her testimony has since been substantiated. The Commission also noted that another member of the department appeared to have been similarly victimised. = Aftermath = Shortly after the commission started sitting, Gene and her mother were robbed at gunpoint by two men but were not harmed; she was also alleged to have received abusive phone calls. Her personal campaign to have the report of the Commission published resulted in her becoming the subject of vicious slander. She was dismissed from the public service without benefits. According to Raffique Shah, Miles had been conducting an affair with a senior government official, stating that \\"not even her relationship with the notorious John O'Halloran could save her from the might of the PNM\\" and that she died \\"a virtual vagrant, pauperised and made an outcast by the same Williams who had attacked corruption with full force- before he came to power!\\" She began to drink and occasionally had to be carried home off the streets. She was eventually spent short periods in both a nursing home and mental hospital. Eventually, though not bed-ridden, she became very ill and was said to be suicidal. She died in her sleep of heart complications at age forty-two.  Legacy  Miles has secured a place in the national lore of Trinidad and Tobago as a whistle-blower and a symbol of resistance. In 2011 she was the subject of a one-woman theatrical production entitled Gene Miles – the Woman of the World starring Cecilia Salazar. The play was authored and directed by playwright Tony Hall. It tells Miles’ life story while exploring contemporary themes of governance and corruption. The play also draws parallels between Gene and her father Ranny Miles, an Ministry of Works accountant who was instrumental in uncovering the Caura Dam Racket. Miles' name has become synonymous with anti-corruption efforts. More specifically, she is associated closely with those whose suffer characters assassination, social ostracism, depression and death as a result of the stand they take against government level impropriety. Her actions and legacy have been interpreted less favourably by others. During the attempted coup of 1990, insurrectionist Yasin Abu Bakr seized control of the national Trinidad and Tobago Television Station during the 7 pm newscast. During his speech he mentioned plans by then Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson to immortalize Miles with a statue, as a primary impetus for the overthrow of the government.

This was an action upon the case by the indorsees of a bill of lading, against the owners of a vessel, to recover the amount of advances made by the former upon the bills of lading, the goods never having in fact been shipped. The court held that a statement in a bill of lading that goods have been shipped is of only prima facie evidential value, and its terms may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary. The justification for the case was that a carrier should not suffer liability if (as was not uncommon at the time) the ship's master had fraudulently colluded with a dishonest shipper and had issued a bill declaring untruthfully that goods had been loaded. (The master would normally be both an employee and an agent of the carrier, but would (in both roles) be acting in breach of the legal fiduciary duty to his employer/principal). The Hague-Visby Rules continued with this view, with Article III (4) stating: > \\"Such a bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the > carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraph 3 > (a), (b) and (c). However, proof to the contrary shall not be admissible > when the bill of lading has been transferred to a third party acting in good > faith.\\" Although the UK has adopted the Hague-Visby Rules,The UK ratified the Hague- Visby Rules in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 for the purposes of English Law a bill of lading is now deemed to be conclusive (not merely prima facie) evidence of receipt as a result of section 4 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992. The reason for the change is that the Law CommissionThe Law Commission Report into \\"Rights of Suit in respect of Carriage of Goods by Sea\\" - Law Com No 196, Scot Law Com no 130), 1991. deemed that, if international confidence were to be maintained, it was crucial that a bill of lading should be relied upon as a conclusive statement of fact.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History Ionia County was organized in 1837. At first, there was a dispute over the location of the county seat, between Ionia and Lyons, but it was soon resolved in favor of Ionia. However, the first courthouse, located at this site, was a small one-story building. By the 1800s, this building was far too small, and a building committee was formed to decide on a replacement. The committee chose Toledo, Ohio architect David W. Gibbs to design the building, and contractor Clare Allen to build it. Ground was broken on the project in 1883. Clare Allen went bankrupt in 1885, and the building committee oversaw the completion of the courthouse in 1886. Electricity was installed in the building in 1922, and extensive remodeling was completed in the 1980s. Construction began on an addition in 2017. The 1883 building is still used by the county government. Description The Ionia County Courthouse is a 3-1/2 story sandstone Classical Revival structure, measuring 120 feet by 80 feet. The sandstone of the lowest floor is a light Ohio sandstone; the remainder of the building is of a worm brown Ionia sandstone. The courthouse sits on a slight rise in a broad courthouse lawn. The front facade has a prominent projecting two-tier portico reached by seven wide steps. The lower tier of the portico has a triple-arched sandstone loggia atop sandstone piers; the upper tier is of wood. The entryway is through a pair of arched doors under the portico. The bays beside the portico are slightly recessed, while the end bays project slightly. A wooden frieze and dentiled cornice fins across the top of the entire building, and the roof is crowned with an elaborate four-stage domed cupola topped with a statue of justice. Secondary entrances are locate in projecting bays on the sides of the building. The rear also has a projecting central bay with an arched entrance and double doors similar to those on the front. The interior of thee courthouse is a hollow square, with courtrooms and offices located around the edges.

History  Taylor Galleries opened in July 1978 ostensibly as a continuation of the Dawson Gallery – a gallery established by Leo Smith in 1944. John Taylor – who worked with the Dawson Gallery since 1964 – continued to run the Dawson Gallery after founder Leo Smith's death in 1977, until the gallery closed in 1978. Taylor opened Taylor Galleries in its place in the same year at 6 Dawson Street. In 1990, Taylor Galleries relocated to smaller premises at 34 Kildare Street, re-designed by the architect Ross Cahill O'Brien, before moving up the road to the current space at 16 Kildare Street in 1996. Today the gallery is managed by John Taylor and his brother Patrick Taylor.  Description  Taylor Galleries exhibits and sells contemporary and twentieth-century painting, sculpture, print and works on paper by select artists, mostly Irish, who are represented by the gallery. Throughout the year it mounts a series of solo exhibitions by gallery artists and two large group shows, one in summer and one in winter, which often include work by additional invited artists. The gallery’s exhibition space is spread over two floors of a large Georgian house dating from 1759 which retains many of its original features, including its central staircase.. Taylor Galleries also represents several long-term gallery artists' estates, including those of Charles Brady, William Crozier, Conor Fallon, Micheal Farrell, T.P. Flanagan, George Potter, Colin Harrison, Nancy Wynne Jones, Louis le Brocquy, Seán McSweeney, Tony O’Malley and Patrick Scott. In 2013, the gallery began showcasing the work of emerging and mid-career artists who did not have gallery representation in Dublin through LACUNA. Planned as an intermittent series of exhibitions curated by Sabina Mac Mahon and gallery artist David Quinn., four iterations of the project have taken place to date.

After his return from the Soviet Union where he had forcibly worked for rocketry development under the Operation Osoaviakhim until 1952 he became an East German party official. During the later 1950s, he was increasingly involved in economic policy, serving from 1958 as head of the Politburo's Economics Commission. He was seen as a reformer. However, economic reform rapidly fell off the agenda after October 1964 when Nikita Khrushchev fell from power in Moscow. Apel served as president of the state planning commission between 1963 and 1965. His final project was to negotiate a trade deal with the Soviet Union. However, hours before he was due to sign the resulting agreement on behalf of the East German government, he committed suicide by firearm.  Life = Early years = Erich Hans Apel was born in Judenbach, a small town in the Franconian Forest which had once benefited from its position as a staging post on a major trade route, but which had lost out commercially following the construction of a railway line providing a direct link from Leipzig to Nuremberg. Apel's father was a mechanical engineer: his mother worked in the garments industry. He attended school in nearby Sonneberg and Steinach, but left school in 1932 in order to embark on an apprenticeship at the Neuhaus porcelain factory in toolmaking and mechanical engineering. The ruling Nazi Party was popular in the region and in 1935 he joined the Deutsches Jungvolk youth organisation. However, it was found that the sixteen year old disrupted the \\"mind-numbingly dull drill exercises\\" (\\"\\"), and he was thrown out after nine months because of his \\"negative attitude\\" to the quasi-military exercises in which the boys were expected to participate. After completing his apprenticeship in 1935 he stayed on at the Neuhaus factory as a toolmaker and designer till 1937. Then, between 1937 and 1939, he attended the Engineering Academy at nearby Ilmenau, emerging with a degree in mechanical engineering. = War years = Directly after receiving his degree, in September 1939 Apel was conscripted into the army, becoming a member of Infantry Reserve Battalion 451, based in Gotha. Around this time World War II broke out. However, on 20 December 1939 Apel was ordered to the Weapons Agency's research facility at Peenemünde on Germany's northern coast. The head of the facility was the charismatic rocketry expert, Wernher von Braun. Apel seems to have been in his element. A contemporary later recalled that he worked from 07.30 till 17.30, like everyone else, but then in the evenings he retreated to his bedroom in a nearby hostel, in order to work on proposals for improvements. His speciality was the hydraulic systems for the rockets. He was tireless in his work of calculation, measuring and modelling. He seems to have made a good impression, since in August 1940 he was relieved of all further obligations regarding military service. In November 1940 he was appointed to the position of plant engineer and assistant to the facility director. He was totally uninterested in politics, never joining the party, and regarded by colleagues as a dedicated engineer, body and soul. 3 October 1942 was Apel's twenty-fifth birthday. Coincidentally, he was able to spent the day as a witness to the first launch anywhere in the world of a long-distance rocket, the so-called (at this stage) A4. The launch took place at 16.00 and everything worked perfectly, the rocket attaining a speed of Mach 4.5, a height of , and a horizontal distance of . At the start of 1943 Apel was promoted again, despite his young age becoming head of one of the many development departments at the Peenemünde army research facility. Shortly after this he mentioned to as group of colleagues what a wretched business it was that the thing should explode in the middle of a city. His boss, Walter Thiel, came to hear of the comment and called him aside, \\"Apel, you should have joined the medical service: you're too soft for the work here\\". However, there is no indication that Apel's comment adversely affected his career prospects: the researchers at Peenemünde saw themselves as an elite team engaged in vital work, and the only realistic alternative career path would have led him back to the military frontline. During 1943 it became clear that the British knew about the research facility at Peenemünde. With their US allies they launched a succession of bombing raids to destroy it, starting in August 1943. Most of the 733 people killed at Peenemünde in the first bombing raid, on 17 August, were forced labourers, but the dead also included Erich Apel's boss, Walter Thiel and his family. By that time, however, Apel himself was far away, transferred in April 1943 with his own team of assembly specialists and administrators to the Linke-Hofmann-Werke (LHW) plant in Breslau (as Wrocław was known before 1945). Breslau was traditionally a centre for railway production and LHW was traditionally a manufacturer of railway locomotives and rolling stock, but during the war its sophisticated engineering capabilities were also being adapted to produce components and sub-assemblies for the rocket, which government propaganda was by now identifying as the \\"Vergeltungswaffe 2\\" (\\"Retribution weapon 2\\" / V-2). As the continuing bombing raids at the Peenemünde Army Research Center had their effect through 1943 and 1944, the LHW plant became the assembly location for the V-2 rockets. In 1 April 1944, at the request of the LHW management, Erich Apel was released from his employment contract with the Army High Command Weapons Agency. He was now employed directly as Chief Engineer and Assistant to the Technical Director at LHW. By the end of 1944 the war was coming home to Germany. LHW now outsourced V-2 rocket production to a firm called \\"Peterbau GmbH\\" in Kleinbodungen near Nordhausen. With the assembly contract they sent Erich Apel, who with effect from January 1945 became Technical Director of Peterbau GmbH. Apel's resolute determination to avoid politics now seemed to catch up with him, since the new location for rocket assembly was part of the vast underground factory at the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Conditions were so dreadful that at least one commentator has suggested that the V-2 rockets found more victims among the slave labourers engaged in constructing the underground factory and in working on the rockets than among the citizens of London, the intended target of the finished rockets. Even if Erich Apel had nothing to do with setting up and running the vast deadly forced labour infrastructure, as the engineer responsible for the rockets he was naturally associated with it. As Nazi Germany collapsed militarily and politically during the first part of 1945, Apel succeeded in getting back to his home village of Judenbach. Like millions of his compatriots he was determined to make a clean break with the past. = Soviet occupation zone = War ended, formally, in May 1945. The entire southern region of Germany had been liberated by the United States Army, but the victorious powers had already agreed a partition of the western two thirds of the country into four military occupation zones. After the Americans had withdrawn to their agreed positions Judenbach was included in the middle portion of Germany that would now be administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Initially Apel worked on the local farms. On 15 January 1946 he enrolled on the \\"New Teachers\\" programme. With millions of working age Germans dead or in prison of war camps, there was a desperate shortage of teachers, and the scheme, implemented with varying levels of effectiveness in the various occupation zones, was designed to select those appropriately educated individuals who were thought to be not excessively tainted by Nazi involvement, to undergo a rapid \\"re-education\\" and set to work educating school-age children. At the same time he both studied and taught, till 31 May 1946, at the Professional Business Academy in nearby Steinach. In January 1946 Erich Apel joined a political party, choosing the centre-left Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). Four months later, the SPD merged with the Communist Party to form the new Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). The merger was presented as a way to prevent divisions on the political left from opening up opportunities for right wing populists to take control as had happened after 1932. In reality it never took effect except in the Soviet zone, where it received sustained practical backing from the military administration. The political development was not one for which Apel could muster much enthusiasm, and in common with many SPD members he was not one of those \\"volunteering\\" to sign his party membership over to the new party (though he was accepted as a member of the SED, eleven years later, in 1957). = An island in the middle of a lake west of Moscow = On 1 June 1946 Apel was \\"picked up\\" by the Soviet authorities. They showed no interest in his association with forced labour at the underground rocket factory at Mittelbau- Dora. But they were nevertheless interested in the factory; and they did make him an offer which, for a range of practical reasons, he was almost certainly in no position to refuse. The Soviets invited him to work with them as chief engineer and representative of the (former) factory management at the Soviet Technical Commission in the Bleicherode quarter of Nordhausen (which had also ended up in the Soviet zone), adjacent to the vast underground rocket plant. Soviet interest in the German rocket programme was fully shared by the United States. During the chaotic closing weeks of the war Wernher von Braun had traveled to Nordhausen and met with Apel, offering to take him to America after the military defeat which by now everyone saw as inevitable. Von Braun was keen, as far as possible, to keep his full team with him. But his specialist in rocket hydraulics turned him down. Apel did not want to volunteer for further work in the weapons industry. On 22 October 1946, across the Soviet occupation zone, in the early hours of the morning technicians and engineers from the rocket project were visited by Soviet officers, each accompanied by a translator. A brief instruction was read out: \\"By order of the Soviet Military Administration you must work for five years in the Soviet Union. You can take your wife and family with you, and as many of your personal effects as you wish ...\\". Till now Apel's working life had involved living in guest houses or barracks so he did not have many personal effects. Just hours after the order was given Apel and his colleagues were on the train heading east as part of Operation Osoaviakhim. The mood on the train was dark and apprehensive. The journey took around 14 days. Their ultimate destination was an island in the middle of Lake Seliger in a sparsely inhabited marshy region some northwest of Moscow. Before crossing to the island Apel was taken to Podlipki (today Korolyov) where he was reunited with a large quantity of heavy machinery and equipment that he had last seen in Germany during the closing weeks of the war. The German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 had forced the Soviets to build up an impressive expertise in deconstructing factories and their equipment, crating them up, and relocating them by train to places beyond the reach of the German army. After the war they had taken the opportunity to perfect their skills, crating up surviving German factories and their equipment, and taking them to the Soviet Union by way of war reparations. The 1937 Opel Kadett turned up in 1947 as the Soviet built Moskvitch 400. They had also applied their skill to the rocket facility in the mountain. The Red army had used 717 railway wagons to carry away 5,647 tonnes of machinery, munitions, and partially constructed rockets. By the end of 1946 a further 2,270 railway wagons had transported another 14,256 rocket construction plant, partially constructed rockets, and specialist machinery from the former Nazi facility in the Soviet occupation zone to a new rocket research facility in the Soviet Union. Secrecy was so complete that ten years later the world still believed that Soviet rocket programme was based on Soviet rocket science. The Americans had taken away only 400 tonnes of \\"rocket materials\\" from the Nordhausen facility. After inspecting the Soviet hoard, Erich Apel joined his colleagues on the Island of Gorodomlya. Keeping the German workers on an island helped enforce the secrecy, but the German experts nevertheless received wages twice as high as those of their Soviet counterparts. Erich Apel became head of a testing department. Seventy years later a colleague from those times remembered him as \\"sociable, but also a little distant. Not so proletarian, and always a bit 'the boss'\\" (\\"\\"Er war gesellig, aber auch ein bisschen distanziert. Nicht so proletenhaft, immer auch ein bisschen 'Der Chef'\\"). There was no attempt to integrate the Germans into the Soviet research teams. Stalin never intended that they should remain permanently. The idea was to \\"milk\\" their knowledge till their Soviet counterparts had absorbed all the necessary knowledge. That point was reached by the end of 1948, after which the Germans on the island were restricted to \\"theoretical\\" research. That suited Apel well enough. He had found a new wife, Christa, the daughter of a German aircraft engineer from the Arado aircraft plant. Information on his first marriage remains in short supply: Christa Apel said later that she believed Erich had married an Austrian woman around 1942, but the first marriage had ended in divorce because Apel's war work meant he was almost always away. It was frequently indicated that during his six years in the Soviet Union Erich Apel became a communist, but in his bones it seems reasonable to conclude that he remained a political agnostic. = German Democratic Republic = Erich Apel returned on 2 June 1952. The Soviet occupation zone had been relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany), seen by many - especially in the west - as a new kind of one-party dictatorship. There was no call, in East Germany, for specialist expertise in weapons and rocketry. Other branches of heavy industry remained in place, however. Just four months after getting back, Erich Apel was working as a Chief Engineer and Department Head at the East German Ministry for Machinery Construction. Promotion to a Technical Directorship followed in April 1953. In November 1953 he became a deputy minister in the department,Neues Deutschland, 20 March 1958. working under Heinrich Rau. He owed his rapid advancement in the new state to its leader, Walter Ulbricht. After years under military occupation which in many ways placed Soviet well-being ahead of German reconstruction, Ulbricht had narrowly survived the 1953 Uprising and was now keen to demonstrate that under Soviet sponsorship it was possible to create in East Germany a fully functioning socialist state. For that he needed technical experts and talented administrators. Apel was both. An important political ally and sponsor was Fritz Selbmann. After his six years in the Soviet Union, Apel (like Selbmann), was a convinced proponent of a \\"Planned economy\\". The choice was one between \\"Rationalty\\" (Vernunft) and \\"Chaos\\". It was already apparent that in West Germany free market capitalism was giving rise to far more rapid economic growth than anything happening in East Germany. The lesson to be drawn was that economic planning had to be undertaken competently and in microscopic detail by the government. Political leadership was needed. In June 1954, already a junior government minister, Apel became a candidate for party membership. Membership was granted in March 1957. Slightly more than one year later, in July 1958, he became a candidate for Central Committee membership.Neues Deutschland, 17. July 1958 In July 1960 Erich Apel became one of approximately 112 members of the powerful Party Central Committee.Neues Deutschland, 24 July 1960 Under the Leninist constitutional structure in place, the Central Committee exercised a far tighter degree of control than government ministers or the National Parliament (Volkskammer). It was therefore by most reckoning a promotion when on 6 February 1958 Erich Apel resigned his ministerial position and accepted a position as head of the newly created Economic Commission of the Central Committee's Politburo. In 1958 he also became a member of the Volkskammer, in which capacity he chaired the Parliamentary Economic Committee. The economic challenges facing East Germany were already formidable by 1960. The mandate Walter Ulbricht gave to the new Economic Commission was summed up in the mantra which the leader liked to repeat. East Germany should \\"overtake without catching up\\" (\\"überholen ohne einzuholen\\"). East Germans must be able to eat more butter and meat than West Germans. One day they must be able to travel in faster cars and live in better apartments. This must be accomplished without having to copy \\"capitalist production methods\\". Erich Apel must make it happen, not \\"someday ... never\\", but by creating and following a plan. If it was a dream, it was a dream in which many comrades evidently believed. In July 1961 Apel was promoted to candidate membership of the politburo and secretaryship of the Central Committee.Neues Deutschland, 5 July 1961. There were other appointments which combined to stress his importance in the wider government project. In 1960 he received a doctorate in return for a dissertation on the so-called East German Chemistry Programme. The \\"Chemistry Programme\\" was a seven-year plan, launched in 1958 under the widely communicated motto \\"Chemistry gives us bread, welfare and beauty\\" (\\"Chemie gibt Brot, Wohlstand und Schönheit\\"), and designed to double chemicals production by 1965, making it the country's second largest industrial sector after mechanical engineering. The project was closely identified with Erich Apel, whose intellectual brilliance marked him, and the project, out for success. But reality got in the way of the targets. Reparations extracted by the Soviets had bled the country of its capacity to rebuild and maintain the infrastructure necessary to support the East German government's economic aspirations. Cut off by international political rivalries from western and world markets, the nation continued to be dependent on deliveries of vital raw materials from the Soviet Union, and the partnership with the Soviets, even at the height of the Cold War, was far less fraternal than would have been assumed at the time in the west. Recently discovered documents indicate that even in 1959 Moscow agreed to deliver to the German Democratic Republic only around half the raw materials which the East German economic plan for 1960-62 called for. One solution was to try and select trading partners according to commercial criteria and not purely according to political dogma. The economic blockade dividing East Germany from the west was largely self-imposed: between 1962 and 1965 Apel was able to oversee a modest trend whereby the proportion of East Germany's foreign trade with west rose from 21% to 25% of the total. But more than half of the country's trade was reported in 1965 to be with the Soviet Union, conducted on terms favourable to Moscow and disadvantageous to East Germany, applying set prices that were well below \\"world market prices\\", both for exports and for imports. In 1964 Otto Grotewohl and Willi Stoph took over as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of East Germany Council of Ministers . At the time there were some who saw Stoph as Walter Ulbricht's heir apparent. A level of rivalry within the Party Central Committee was normal, but between Apel and Stoph there quickly emerged a particularly intense mutual antagonism. To the extent that both men were responsible for delivering a better future for the people there was an inherent overlap between their public profiles. Stoph never missed a chance to highlight a failure to meet planned objectives or to criticise Apel's actions and utterances. Pressure also increased from Moscow where Nikita Khrushchev fell from power in October 1964. Leonid Brezhnev, the new party secretary in Moscow, condemned his predecessor's \\"failures of economic leadership\\". There were a number of rapid practical changes. Soviet wheat deliveries to East Germany planned for 1966 were cut back to 400,000 tonnes, a third of the annual quantity in existing plans. Within the East German leadership Apel had always been able to count on backing for his reforms from Walter Ulbricht, but the changes in Moscow meant that Ulbricht's driving priority had was now to secure his own position. Back in January 1963 Ulbricht had stunned colleagues, under the influence of Apel, announcing a 180-degree reversal on economic policy. \\"We need economics to trump politics\\" ( \\"Wir brauchen ein Primat der Ökonomie über die Politik!\\"). There was talk of revitalising the market and allowing private trade - subject to a restrictive framework - and of moving society away from a semi-military footing towards a civil one. That had been in 1963, before the fall of Khrushchev. But now the leader was ready for another 180 degree reversal over economic policy. On 3 December 1965 Erich Apel was due to sign a new economic agreement with the Soviet Union covering the period 1966-1970. Earlier that year he had traveled to Moscow with Walter Ulbricht to finalise the terms. Apel was not in favour of signing the agreement that the comrades in Moscow had imposed, but he had been opposed by Alfred Neumann, Chairman of the People's Economic Council and a Moscow loyalist. More importantly, he had been over-ruled by Walter Ulbricht. Early that morning the telephone rang in Apel's office at the ministry in East Berlin. Willi Stoph wanted a word. There was no reply. Erich Apel, while seated at his desk, had taken his own life. A 7.65 mm bullet from his service pistol lay at his feet. The East German signature on the trade deal with the Soviets would be that of Alfred Neumann. News of Apel's death was held back till after the Soviet signatory, Trade Minister Nikolai Patolichev had left town, later that day. There were those who believed Erich Apel had been murdered, in the context of an increasingly intense power struggle between Politburo members as Walter Ulbricht's period in power was seen to be coming to an end. Ulbricht himself ordered the Ministry for State Security to investigate Apel's death, though later commentators found the aspects of the investigation \\"uncharacteristically sloppy\\". On the other hand, West Berlin's mayor, Willy Brandt was never in doubt that Erich Apel's death had been a suicide, performed in protest over the Soviet Union's continuing exploitation of East Germany. Brandt reacted with a cryptic prophesy: \\"He did not die quietly. We will all hear from him again, from what it was that made him do it.\\" (\\"Er ist nicht schweigend gestorben. Wir alle werden noch von ihm hören, von dem, was ihn bewegte\\").

It was released on November 6, 2017. Media outlets reported that it was the lead single from Ashanti's upcoming sixth album. The single was produced by DJ Mustard, and was written by Ashanti and Ty Dolla $ign. It is an R&B;, club, and West Coast hip hop song whose lyrics are about someone telling critics to mind their own businesses; Ashanti and Ty Dolla $ign also flirt with one another on the track. \\"Say Less\\" was praised by critics following its release; its vocals were frequently cited as the highlights, though commentators were divided over the production. The song was used in a commercial for Cîroc vodka, and Ashanti further promoted it with live performances. A music video was released on April 6, 2018 on Ashanti's Vevo account. In the video, Ashanti confronts rumors around her career and experiences media scrutiny. Recording and release alt=An image of a young black man with dreadlocks and tattooed forearms wearing rosaries and a white tee-shirt bearing a black-and-blue design reminiscent of the Stars and Stripes flag. Ashanti wrote \\"Say Less\\" Ty Dolla $ign while working with him in a recording studio; the song was produced by DJ Mustard. Ty Dolla $ign provided collaborative verses for the song. Ty Dolla $ign and Ashanti had agreed to work together after talking on a group text started by Ashanti's brother; they first met in Los Angeles. Ashanti said she thought his melody and cadence fit her music. \\"Say Less\\" was recorded in Tyrese Gibson's recording studio in Miami and was mixed in Atlanta. \\"Say Less\\" was made available through her record label Written Entertainment. Media outlets reported that it was the lead single from Ashanti's upcoming sixth album, and referred to it as her comeback single. In a Billboard interview, Ashanti said that she considered released one to two other songs from her upcoming album instead of \\"Say Less\\". She picked \\"Say Less\\" as a single since it was featured in an advertisement for Cîroc vodka. The song was released on November 6, 2017, as a digital download. Ashanti first announced it during a conversation with a TMZ cameraman. Clean and explicit versions of the song were made available. The cover art shows Ashanti naked and covered only with an oversized checkered purse. The day following its release, the track was uploaded to WorldStarHipHop's YouTube account. Composition and lyrics \\"Say Less\\" is an R&B;, club and West Coast hip hop song, that lasts three minutes and 14 seconds. Carl Lamarre of Billboard wrote that the composition featured Mustard's \\"signature flavor\\", while Trevor Smith of HotNewHipHop identified it as having a West-Coast hip hop sound. Glenn Gamboa of Newsweek described it as an R&B; take on Demi Lovato's pop music. Brooke Marine of W wrote that \\"Say Less\\" is an example of the album's \\"slew of fun party bops that fit in with Ashanti's idea of empowerment\\". Several music critics called the track \\"bouncy\\". The song revolves around Ashanti telling critics to stay out of her business, and lyrics include \\"bitch, say less\\". Ashanti said about the song's lyrics: \\"I think nowadays we have to make it very clear that if it's B.S., say less, I'm a New Yorker. It's a very New York term. And I think it's just about being bold and getting to the point. I don't have time for you to waste it.\\" During the song, Ashanti and Ty Dolla $ign flirt with one another. In the single edit, she sings: \\"This is your body/ Ain't no way I could hide it/ I wanna be your top supplier/ Cause I'll provide this all to you\\". She also talks about acting like a boss: \\"If it ain't about the money, say less\\". Ty Dolla $ign boasts about his wealth in the verses: \\"Young n---a got the pool with me / Make it rain, got a budget on me\\". He brags about stealing a man's girlfriend by rapping: \\"Pull up to the party / Jewels all on my body / Your chick on my body / And they can't tell me nothin'\\". Critical reception \\"Say Less\\" received primarily positive reviews from music critics. Praising the song's composition and Mustard's production as \\"catchy\\", Carl Lamarre wrote \\"Ashanti's dulcet vocals are sweeter than ever\\". Emmanuel C.M. of XXL called it \\"a fun club record\\", and Claire Valentine of Paper praised Ashanti's confidence. Sydney Gore of MTV said the single \\"will definitely spark the fire of your desire this winter\\". A reviewer from Rap-Up praised Mustard's production and Ashanti's vocals, and referred to Ty Dolla $ign's contributions as \\"soothing vocals\\". Trevor Smith described Ty Dolla $ign and Mustard as \\"a proven hitmaking team\\", and wrote that they acted as \\"a strong support section\\" for Ashanti. Other critics responded negatively to the song's composition. D-Money of SoulBounce.com praised \\"Say Less\\" as \\"the kind of frothy, club-ready R&B; aimed straight for the mainstream\\", but criticized it for lacking \\"substance, memorability or staying power\\". Tom Breihan of Stereogum was more critical of the single, writing that it was stuck in \\"the hot sound of four years ago\\" and does not sound like an Ashanti song. Music video and promotion=Promotion and live performances= On November 21, 2017, \\"Say Less\\" was featured in a 20-second advertisement for Cîroc vodka, in which Ashanti wears a bikini. She promoted the commercial with images posted to her Instagram account. Sean Combs had asked Ashanti to appear in the commercial during a meeting at a Las Vegas party. During the filming, Combs told her to create a \\"Bo Derek moment\\" for the video. According to Glenn Gamboa, Ashanti collaborated with Cîroc \\"to empower women by offering her keys to a successful career\\". Ashanti explained: \\"I think I always try to just give the message of being an empowered woman and being able to empower women\\". When discussing the wardrobe for the video, she said: \\"Women should just be proud without having to feel any pressure.\\" Ashanti performed \\"Say Less\\" as part of a co-headlining concert tour with Ja Rule. Victor D. Infante of Telegram & Gazette wrote that she \\"delivered with equal measures sass and style\\". She sang the track at Billboard Live as part of medley with her previous songs; Bryan Kess of Billboard included it in his list of the top 20 Billboard Live performances of 2017. Ashanti also appeared on Genius' YouTube channel to explain the song's meaning and lyrics. On May 21, 2018, she performed \\"Say Less\\" on Good Day L.A.. =Music video= In a 2017 interview with Billboard, Ashanti said a music video for the single was planned, and a preview clip was scheduled to be shown on Total Request Live. The video, directed by Noyz and LT Hutton, was released on April 6, 2018 on Ashanti's Vevo account. Throughout the video, Ashanti is confronted by media scrutiny, and Ty Dolla $ign makes minor appearances in several scenes. Abby Jones of Billboard described the video as including \\"theatrical elements\\". In the opening scene, Ashanti narrates: \\"Sometimes I feel like, 'Is it really all worth it, for people to attack you and judge you, without even knowing what kind of pain and suffering you might be going through behind closed doors?'\\". In the video, Ashanti reflects on her life while a television presenter discusses previous scandals involving her career. The reports include her interview with Joe Budden about a fan throwing money at her during a live performance, the indictment of Murder, Inc., and allegations of a hit and run. Ashanti also watches television host Wendy Williams on her daytime talk show and looks at gossip websites. According to the media, Ashanti pushed a fan into a pool; this is later proven untrue because the fan had accidentally fallen into the water. Ashanti responds to the media by saying: \\"Honestly, people need to just say less.\\" The video ends with \\"to be continued\\".

Coastguard cruisers Romanian coastguard cruiser Grivița NMS Bistrița These vessels were essentially large border patrol boats armed with multiple light guns. Five such warships were operated by the Romanian Navy, from 1873 until 1968. The first was named Fulgerul, officially commissioned in 1874. She was followed by the larger Grivița in 1880, and finally by the Bistrița-class of three vessels in 1888.John Evelyn Moore, Jane's Fighting Ships of World War I, Military Press, 1990, p. 295 =Fulgerul= This 85-ton gunboat was the first purpose-built, sea-going warship of the Romanian Navy.

She was built in 1880 by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Austria-Hungary, being the last warship purchased by Romania before the country's conversion to a Kingdom in 1881. She measured 60.5 meters in length, with a beam of 5.2 meters and a draught of 1.8 meters. She displaced 110 tons standard and 128 tons with a full load of coal, had a crew of 30 men and a top speed of 9 knots, generated by a 180 hp steam engine.

They were built in 1888 by Thames Iron Works in London and each vessel was armed with one 57 mm gun and one 37 mm gun.

The Times (36631). London. 6 December 1901. p. 6. Scout cruisers=Paper projects= In 1912, based on the 1912 Romanian naval program which envisioned 6 light cruisers and 12 large destroyers, Vickers offered two protected scout cruiser designs to Romania. The first design, named Design 634, was to displace 3,100 tons and have a top speed of 27 knots. Armament was to consist of six 152 mm guns, six 102 mm guns and two 533 mm deck-mounted torpedo tubes. The second proposal, known as Design 635, was heavier and slower. Designed displacement was to amount to 3,200 tons with a top speed of 24 knots. The six 152 mm guns envisioned by the previous design were replaced by two 190 mm guns. None of these were accepted by Romania, however.Norman Friedman, British Cruisers of the Victorian Era, Seaforth Publishing, 2012, p. 272 =Aquila-class= Aquila-class scout cruiser in 1917 In 1913, Romania ordered four large destroyers from the Pattison Shipyard in Naples, Italy. These 1,500 vessels were to be armed with three 120 mm naval guns, four 75 mm guns and five torpedo tubes. However, the four warships were requisitioned by Italy in 1915, upon the country's entering into the First World War. In order to outgun the Austro-Hungarian Navy's cruisers, the three designed 120 mm guns were replaced by larger 152 mm guns. Four 76 mm guns were fitted and two twin 457 mm torpedo tubes were mounted on broadsides. Two 6.5 mm machine guns were also fitted. The four vessels were designated as esploratori (scout cruisers) by the Royal Italian Navy. Each cruiser measured 94.7 meters in length, with a beam of 9.5 meters and a draught of 3.6 meters. Power plant consisted of Tosi turbines and five Thornycroft boilers, generating a designed output of 40,000 hp powering two shafts, which gave each warship a designed top speed of 34 knots. However, this actually oscillated between 35 and 38 knots, depending on the vessel. Each ship had a complement of 146, with ranges of 1,700 nautical miles at 15 knots and 380 nautical miles at 34 knots. Only two of the four warships were transferred to Romania after the end of World War I, in 1920. They were renamed Mărăști and Mărășești.Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906-1921, Naval Institute Press, 1985, p. 266 Upon commissioning by Romania on 1 July 1920, Mărăști and Mărășești were re-classified as destroyers, reverting to their original designation.Revista istorică, Volumul 15, Edițiile 1-2, Institutul, 2004, p. 221 (in Romanian) However, English-language sources of the period refer to the two warships as flotilla leaders,Defence Yearbook, Brassey's Naval and Shipping Annual, 1923, p. 357 most likely on account of their three cruiser-typical 152 mm guns. The two scout cruisers were finally re-armed as destroyers in 1925-1926, their three 152 mm guns being replaced by five 120 mm guns (two twin and one single).Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922-1946, Naval Institute Press, 1980, p. 360 Despite being rearmed as destroyers, the two warships still presented some cruiser characteristics, such as having their torpedo tubes mounted on the broadsides instead of the centerline. As large destroyers in the limited waters of the Black Sea, the two warships were recognized as possible cruiser substitutes by British literature.Norman Friedman, British Cruisers of the Victorian Era, Seaforth Publishing, 2012, p. 272 References Romania Cruisers ","title":"List of cruisers of Romania"},{"id":"56469973","text":"right Louis Chein (Paris, 1637-1694) was French priest and composer best known for his requiem mass for four voices published by Ballard in 1690.Jean-Paul C.

Peter A. Boodberg claimed in 1935 that the Ruanruan language was Mongolic by analysing Chinese transcriptions of Ruan-ruan names. Alexander Vovin noted that Old Turkic had borrowed some words from an unknown non-Altaic language that may have been Ruan-ruan, arguing that if so, the language would be non- Altaic language, unrelated to its neighbours and possibly a language isolate, though evidence was scant. He had previously suggested Ruan-ruan could be related to the Yeniseian languages.Vajda, Edward J. (2013). Yeniseian Peoples and Languages: A History of Yeniseian Studies with an Annotated Bibliography and a Source Guide. Oxford/New York: Routledge. In 2013, Atwood notes that Rourans calqued the Sogdian word pūr \\"son\\" into their language as *k’obun (Chinese transliteration: 去汾 MC *kʰɨʌH-bɨun > Mandarin qùfén); which, according to Atwood, is cognate with Middle Mongol kö'ün \\"son\\". In 2019, with the emergence of new evidence through the analysis of the Brāhmī Bugut and Khüis Tolgoi, Vovin changed his view, suggesting Ruan-ruan was, in fact a Mongolic language, close but not identical to Middle Mongolian.

U.S. and Afghan government forces were in the Gaza Valley area of Arghandab District conducting security operations in advance of the 2014 Afghan presidential elections when they came under attack from Taliban militants, sparking a firefight. An American air controller on the ground requested close air support from a B-1B bomber flying in the vicinity to support a team of soldiers maneuvering on a ridge. The U.S. aircraft dropped two guided bombs on the position, killing the team of Americans and an Afghan soldier. It was the deadliest incident of fratricide to take place between American forces in the country since the beginning of the Afghanistan War, and raised questions over the standard operating procedures of U.S. troops and their close air support assets. An investigation of the incident blamed the airstrike on the commander of the American troops on the ground, the U.S. combat air controller who coordinated the strike, and a flaw in the design of the B-1B bomber's targeting pod which prevents the aircrew from being able to identify the infrared strobe lights on the helmets of American soldiers that serve to allow pilots to distinguish friendly troops from enemy troops. Background=Before operation= Zabul Province is a semi-mountainous region in southern Afghanistan that borders Pakistan to the east, Kandahar in the west and in the south, and Oruzgan in the north. Predominantly Pashtun, it is one of Afghanistan's most sparsely populated provinces with just 45 people per square mile according to a 2015 census, mostly rural tribe members spread among numerous isolated villages in the region. Zabul is one of Afghanistan's poorest provinces and serves as a transit point for fighters entering the country through the porous border with Pakistan. The Taliban have had a presence in Zabul for many years. In 2003, it was the first province in Afghanistan where the group was successful in establishing a large base after the invasion two years prior. However, Zabul was the first province to see Afghan army forces operate independently from NATO forces and was heralded as a model for other provinces, and the presence of U.S. troops has largely been reduced to special operations forces. In 2014, Afghanistan held a presidential election to replace incumbent Hamid Karzai. The first round of the election was held with no candidate reaching the required 50% threshold to clinch the presidency leaving former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and ex-World Bank economist Ashraf Ghani to proceed to a runoff election to be held on 14 June. The election was marked by periods of violence perpetrated by the country's Taliban insurgency and it was the first presidential election in Afghanistan where Afghan security forces were leading security for the event. One week before the first round elections, militants attacked the headquarters of the country's election commission in Kabul. In early June 2014, Abdullah Abdullah survived an assassination attempt when his convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber, killing three of his bodyguards. =B-1B Lancer= Though not designed as a close air support platform the Rockwell B-1B Lancer, a four-engine heavy bomber, has been utilized copiously in support of U.S. and coalition ground forces engaged in combat operations against insurgent forces. In 2012, the nine B-1B bombers of the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron flew 770 sorties on its deployment to Afghanistan. The bomber has proved popular in Afghanistan due to its ability to carry a large payload, and remain in the air for long periods of time, allowing it to fly throughout the country and support multiple ground operations in just one sortie. Beginning in 2007, B-1B bombers began to be outfitted with Sniper Advanced Targeting Pods (AN/AAQ-33), an advanced targeting pod that provides high-resolution FLIR imagery to aircrews to help identify ground targets. According to Air Force Colonel Marilyn Kott the pod, \\"increases the speed and accuracy with which the aircrew and the JTAC can execute the find-fix-track-target portion of the kill chain.\\" Operation= Units involved and insertion= On 8 June 2014, U.S. troops and Afghan security forces began clearing operations in Gaza Valley, in Zabul Province ahead of the 2014 runoff presidential election to be held on 14 June with the aim of disrupting Taliban insurgent activity and improving security for voters and polling sites. U.S. elements involved in the operation included soldiers from the 5th Special Forces Group, and the 4th Infantry Division. Afghan security forces were composed of members of the Afghan National Army (ANA), Afghan National Police (ANP), and the Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS). The principal ANA unit involved in the operation was the 2nd Kandak, 4th Brigade, 215th Corps, a battalion based in neighboring Helmand Province. One of the units from the 5th Special Forces Group involved in the clearing operations included an Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) under the command of Captain Derrick Anderson. The ODA's joint terminal attack controller (JTAC), an Air Force specialist trained in coordinating air to ground fire had joined the team on 1 June 2014. The ODA was aided by Afghan troops, however less than requested due to manning issues. Prior to the operation the unit assessed the most likely response to the clearing operations by Taliban forces was to be \\"passive observation\\" with the threat of small arms fire, and improvised explosive devices. An American special operations soldier in Gaza Valley in 2013. At 02:30 local time on 9 June, coalition forces entered Gaza Valley by helicopter and began clearing operations with Afghan forces at the lead due to rules of engagement barring U.S. troops from entering Afghan compounds. During the day U.S. and Afghan troops received brief harassing fire from insurgents. It was at this time that Taliban forces began preparing an assault on coalition troops. =Firefight= Shortly before 20:00 local time, as coalition forces moved to their respective pickup zones (PZs), Taliban forces attacked coalition troops. A B-1B bomber was already in the air, in the vicinity of Gaza Valley, to provide overwatch for friendly forces. Captain Anderson's ODA, supported by Afghan and conventional U.S. troops, began taking fire. The team was split into two elements with six members maneuvering to high ground to more effectively engage insurgent forces. The team reported Taliban positions, some as close as 150 meters (490 feet) away. The JTAC, not with the team that had moved to high ground, asked the B-1B pilots if they could see the infrared strobes on the helmets of the U.S. troops on the ground to which the crew responded, \\"negative IR strobes,\\" before the JTAC began relaying target coordinates to the bomber. In addition, the JTAC gave an incorrect location to the bomber crew of the nearest coalition troops, stating they were 300 meters away (1,000 ft), rather than the actual 150 meters (500 ft), before requesting laser- guided bombs to be dropped on enemy positions. \\"All friendlies are 300 meters west with IR strobes on taking effective fire; I need you guys in,\\" the JTAC told the bomber crew, to which the crew responded that they would be \\"in\\" in one minute. Communication between the element on the ridgeline and the rest of the troops including Captain Anderson, and the air controller degraded as the firefight went on, due to the malfunctioning radios of those troops on the high ground. Just before the airstrike, one of the soldiers, SSgt. Mcdonald of the 5th Special Forces Group had removed the IR strobe on his helmet and attached it to his pack located on the ground to mark his location as friendly. =Fatal airstrike= At 20:20 local time, the controller cleared the B-1 crew to drop ordnance as it made a final pass over the target site, telling the aircraft it was \\"cleared hot.\\". At 20:21 local time, the B-1B bomber dropped two, five-hundred pound JDAM guided bombs on the ridgeline with a five millisecond delay between each bomb. Immediately after the airstrike, U.S. forces on the ground realized the strike was awry, having landed on friendly forces with the ODA's team sergeant stating over the radio that the strike had hit \\"our hill.\\" The first U.S. troops took seven minutes to reach the ridgeline where they discovered the extent of damage caused by the strike. The blast instantly killed five of the six coalition soldiers on the ridge, with one, SSgt. Scott R. Studenmund of the 5th Special Forces Group, becoming severely wounded. Army medic, SSgt. Brandon Branch discovered the wounded Studenmund and began to apply tourniquets before the gravely wounded Special Forces soldier succumbed to his wounds. Coalition troops immediately descended on the area to recover remains and equipment. The bodies of five of the killed were recovered however a sixth was determined to be incinerated and the troops left the area. A ceremony was held at Kandahar Airfield to honor those killed in the airstrike, before their remains were repatriated to Dover Air Force Base for identification and delivery to the families.

Harrigian was commissioned to investigate the strike. Harrigan commenced an eight-week probe into the incident which included interviewing the B-1 crew, the air controller, and the other U.S. troops who were on the ground that day as well as examining the U.S. equipment used in the strike, such as the bomber's targeting pod, and listening to radio transmissions. At the end of his investigation, Harrigan declared that the \\"incident was avoidable,\\" and put the blame largely on Captain Derrick Anderson, the commander of the U.S. troops on the ground that day, the unnamed Air Force joint terminal attack controller who had guided the airstrike, and mistakes made by the B-1 crew. Harrigan cited a false sense of urgency created by the U.S. troops on the ground who stated they were taking \\"effective fire\\" that led to unwarranted pressure being placed on the B-1B crew to hastily carry out an airstrike. During a 60 Minutes interview in 2017, Army medic Brandon Branch and 5th Special Forces Group soldier Henry Montalbano criticized this characterization by saying it was an unfair description of the events on the ground made by someone who was not there at the time. Air Force combat controllers in Afghanistan during a nighttime operation. In addition, Harrigan pointed to mistakes made by the JTAC including giving an incorrect location of the nearest U.S. troops to the target coordinates, not following correct procedures, lacking situational awareness, failing to declare \\"danger close\\" since the nearest friendly forces were within 300 meters, and not assuring that the pilots had made positive identification of the target. Anderson was rebuked for failing to properly supervise the JTAC assigned to his team. At no time did the pilots question the information provided by the JTAC, even when the distances of U.S. troops to the target inexplicably changed. Harrigan said the pilots relied too much on a single source of information, the Sniper Pod, and did not take additional steps to confirm the location of friendly forces. The Sniper Pod is not capable of identifying IR strobes and the night-vision goggles used by the crew can only detect IR strobes at ranges up to 7,000 meters, hampering the crew's ability to separate friendly and enemy forces on the battlefield. It was not known by any of the U.S. forces on the ground that day that the B-1B Sniper Pod was incapable of detecting infrared strobes, which is one of the primary methods used by coalition forces to identify friendly forces at nighttime. Instead, the B-1B crew had used muzzle flashes as a way of locating its target. =Consequences= A closer view of the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod Captain Derrick Anderson, through the use of his own lawyers, was ultimately cleared of any responsibility in the strike and faced no punitive action, however the incident led to end of his military career. The Air Force JTAC who called in the strike was ultimately forced out of the special operations community. Despite the flaws in the Sniper Pod, no plans have been made fix the issue, however B-1B crews have been made aware of the critical flaw and received retraining on the device as a result. No changes have been made to the B-1B's use as a close air support platform. According to Woody Studenmund, the father of one of the soldiers killed in the awry strike, \\"None of the other mistakes mattered, none of them mattered. When we send our soldiers into battle, it's wrong to have them using a weapon system which isn't capable of doing what it's supposed to be doing. It's not murder, but it's close.\\" See also *Joint terminal attack controller *List of friendly fire incidents *B-1 Lancer *Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod *List of military operations in the war in Afghanistan (2001–present) References Friendly fire incidents 21st-century military history of the United States Airstrikes during the War in Afghanistan (2001–present) 2014 in Afghanistan History of Zabul Province ","title":"2014 Gaza Valley airstrike"},{"id":"56470051","text":"Paucisalibacillus is a genus of bacteria from the family of Bacillaceae.

Fig. 1, portion of branch 1a, flower; 1b, petal showing glands. Pseudowintera traversii, sometimes called Travers horopito, is a species of woody shrub in the family Winteraceae. The specific epithet traversii is in honor of naturalist Henry H. Travers (1844-1928), son of William Thomas Locke Travers. Description Pseudowintera traversii is a densely branched shrub growing up to high. It has coriaceous leaves that are long and ovate or obovate. The leaves are green- blue underneath and matte green on top, close-set and on stout petioles. The leaves may have reddish margins, but lack the picturesque blotches of P. colorata. However they are described as tasting peppery and pungent. The bark is reddish-brown and rough. The green or yellow flowers appear in January, growing singly or as doubles, or rarely triples, with 5-7 petals and 4-9 stamens. The fruit appears in February as a fleshy berry, that is purplish- black and in diameter, containing 3-6 seeds. Like all Winteraceae species, P. traversii lacks vessels in its xylem Habitat Like the other species of horopito in Pseudowintera, it is endemic to New Zealand. It is the rarest of the species, and the national government there lists it as \\"At Risk - Naturally Uncommon.\\" Naturally, it only is found growing in montane shrubland and woodland edges on the South Island in northwest Nelson between Westport and Collingwood.Allen, H.

His projects explore the possibilities of the voice as instrument across multiple musical genres, including contemporary classical, electronica, and a range of popular styles—often in combination. He writes songs and music for multiple voices, which he integrates into operas and other cross-disciplinary forms. Hallett often collaborates with artists in dance, performance, cinema, and new media. He is a performer in most of his works.  Biography  Hallett trained at Oberlin Conservatory under singing pedagogy authority, Richard Miller. In New York during the year 2000, he formed the Plantains with Ray Sweeten/The Mitgang Audio, a band uniting cabaret and Electroclash music with video projection and performance art. Hallett’s songs were written from the perspective of a fake British alter ego named Nick L. Cat. Plantains shared bills with Le Tigre and Scissor Sisters before disbanding in 2003. In 2004, Hallett and Sweeten recorded a cover of the song \\"I Feel Love\\" for a student film by Matt Wolf, which resulted in the duo’s only commercial release from this period. Hallett transitioned into experimental music and contemporary art, as both performer and curator. In 2004, he co-founded the Darmstadt series with Zach Layton. Originally conceived as a casual listening event of avant-garde recordings, Darmstadt quickly began hosting informal, modern- classical music concerts in nightclubs, and within a few years had evolved into a presenter of festivals and large-scale performances of repertory from the experimental music canon. In 2014, for Darmstadt’s 10th anniversary, Hallett curated, co-produced, and performed in a new staging of Karlheinz Stockhausen’s Originale at The Kitchen, recognizing the 50th anniversary of the work’s storied New York premiere, and cast predominantly with artists who identify as female, queer, transgender, and of color. Darmstadt also presents an annual concert of Terry Riley’s In C. In 2007, Hallett formed a creative relationship with multimedia artist Joshua White, founder of the Joshua Light Show, an oft-referenced psychedelic concert lighting company, originally active from 1967 to 1970, whose contributions to the fields of expanded cinema and light art have since been recognized in an art historical context. After programming a concert of the Joshua Light Show at The Kitchen, which re- established the group, Hallett became White’s music director, positioning the project within experimental rock and electronica. In 2011, Hallett produced the soundscore to Fulldome, a performance by the Joshua Light Show at the Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum of Natural History. Hallett composed the music and libretto for Whispering Pines 10, an opera collaboration with artist Shana Moulton, based on her video art serial. This was originally staged in 2010 at The Kitchen, sung by Hallett and vocalist Daisy Press, and featuring Moulton as the sole actor, performing within an environment of multichannel video projection. The work, which also featured interactive technology and wearable musical instruments designed by Moulton and Hallett, toured art museums and performance festivals across the United States. In 2013, the duo received a Creative Capital grant to adapt Whispering Pines 10 for the internet. In 2014, Hallett began a collaboration with the choreographer and director Bill T. Jones, as the composer of a trilogy of scores for the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company: Analogy/Dora: Tramontane (2015), Analogy/Lance aka Pretty aka The Escape Artist (2016), and Analogy/Ambros: The Emigrant (2017). Hallett has toured with the company as vocalist and multi-instrumentalist in the performances of the Analogy trilogy, and an additional work featuring his music, A Letter to My Nephew. Hallett’s scores for dance also include the Bessie-award-winning Variations on Themes from Lost and Found: Scenes from a Life and other works by John Bernd (2016), directed by Ishmael Houston-Jones and Miguel Gutierrez, based upon original choreography and music by John Bernd.

His groundbreaking work in DuPage County helped establish more affordable housing options.  Early Life  Soles was born in Anniston, Alabama, but was raised in Plainfield, New Jersey. There he attended Plainfield High School, and later received degrees from Manhattan Bible Institute and Rutgers University. He spent the early part of his adult life as a minister and journalist in New Jersey. There he married his wife, Effie, who is also an ordained minister.  Ministry = Professional sports = The Soles family moved to Wheaton, Illinois, in 1969 after he accepted a job at Urban Ministries Inc. in Calumet City. His ministry in professional sports began in 1973 when he was asked to lead chapel services for the Chicago Bears. Later in the decade he began to work with the Chicago White Sox, and eventually left the Bears to focus on his new role. His experience with both teams led to him creating an organization in 1979 designed specifically to serve the spiritual needs of professional athletes, Intersports Associates Inc. That is also the year that he got the idea to lead chapel services as a volunteer for the Bulls. He approached former Bulls forward Dwight Jones with the idea. The Bulls approved of Soles as chaplain, and he then led those services, which were open to visiting teams as well, for the next three decades. = Ministry in the community = Soles' ministry was not confined to Chicago Stadium, and later the United Center. He led a Bible study in downtown Chicago, a ministry for ex-convicts, and another ministry titled Gospel Outreach, to serve young people in a Chicago housing project. As a resident of Wheaton, the DuPage County seat, he was heavily involved in the community where he resided. The Soles family was part of the ministerial staff at DuPage AME Church in Lisle, IL, and he also made a huge impact in DuPage County government. Soles helped found the Community Housing Association of DuPage. Through that organization hundreds of affordable housing units were built in the affluent county. He also served for 10 years as the chairman of the DuPage Housing Authority. His work around the Chicago metropolitan area has earned him in several honors, including Wheaton's 2001 Adult Good Citizen award, and the Serenity House in Arlington Heights, IL giving him their Man of the Year award. = Books = Soles edited two books which were published by Tyndale House, The Soul Food New Testament and the Children of Color Bible. = Death and Illness= Soles battled Alzheimer’s disease late in his life.

After the war she was active in international organizations for peace as well as in providing for refugees of other wars, including the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Early life Clark was born 12 January 1881 at Green Bank, Street, Somerset and was the youngest child of the Quaker shoe manufacturer William Stephens Clark and the social reformer Helen Priestman Bright Clark. The Clark family of Street were Quakers of shoe-making fame as C. and J. Clark Ltd. Manufacturer of boots, shoes & sheepskin rugs. She was the sister of Alice Clark, the feminist and historian and the niece of Annie Clark, one the first pioneering women to formally train in medicine in Britain. Her mother and great-aunts helped to found a number of women's rights organizations in the 1860s. As a child, she was involved in athletics and gymnastics. She had a Quaker education at Brighthelmston, at Birkdale in Southport, Lancashire, about 1896–7, and The Mount, in York, from about 1897 to 1900, before studying medicine at Birmingham University and the Royal Free Hospital, London where she graduated M.B. and B.S. in 1908. Medicine Clark specialised in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. She was instrumental in administering the TB vaccine, tuberculin, developed by Dr W. Camac-Wilkinson.W Camac Wilkinson. The Principles of Immunisation in Tuberculosis. 1926 She opened and ran two tuberculin dispensaries, the first at her home town of Street in Somerset, the second, by appointment as Medical Officer of the Portsmouth Municipal Tuberculin Dispensary in 1911. In 1910 she successfully treated her sister, Alice Clark, a suffragist who was suffering from tuberculosis. Clark gave a paper on \\"Tuberculosis Statistics: Some Difficulties in the Presentation of Facts bearing on the Tuberculosis Problem in a Suitable Form for Statistical Purposes\\", later published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, 1914. During WW1 she was engaged in providing medical relief work in France, Austria and the Soviet Union. She founded Friends' War Victim Relief with fellow Quaker Edmund Harvey and was medical organiser of the first Friends' War Victim Relief team in France, of which her life partner Edith Pye, whom she had met in 1907 at the beginning of her medical studies, was a member. There, at Châlons, she established a Maternité hospital for refugee women, which opened in December 1914. She was also an early supporter of the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, an organisation concerned with gay rights and acceptance. Humanitarian work Clark reported in 1919 on behalf of the Save the Children Fund about the dire condition of children's health in Austria during that country's famine years and proposed cheap dietary solutions to rectify the deficiencies. She organised a scheme to buy cows from the Netherlands and Switzerland and fodder from Croatia and Czechoslovakia in order to produce much needed milk for children. During a visit to Hungary with Dr Hector Munro and Mr Buxton in August 1919, they sent a telegram to the Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs in London, seeking urgent medical supplies for the hospitals of Budapest. During the 1920s Hilda was an active member of a number of humanitarian organisations including the League of Nations, the Women's Peace Crusade (of which she was secretary), the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the International Commission for the Assistance of Child Refugees as well as Quaker campaigns such as the Friends' Service Council. She also worked for the relief of refugees in the Spanish Civil War and World War II. After her work with refugees in various European countries she became a noted speaker about international affairs on behalf of the League of Nations and other international bodies. Clark was Chairman of the Anti- Opium Committee of the Women's International League which advocated state control of 'dangerous drugs'. Later life and death Her home in London was bombed in 1940 and she moved to Kent, where she was active in the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmens Families Association. She became disabled as a result of Parkinson's disease and returned to Street in 1952, where she died unmarried at her home on 24 February 1955 and was buried at the Street Quaker burial ground under the same headstone as Edith Pye.

Plot  President Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) is livid when Wellington (Linus Roache) admits to ordering the air strike on her behalf after she refused to do it. Carrie (Claire Danes) witnesses the whole confrontation on her surveillance cameras. Carrie and Max (Maury Sterling) also look into Simone Martin's movements on the day that McClendon died. By accessing her E-ZPass logs, Max learns that her route took her to five separate cash advance locations. In the midst of the standoff at Bo Elkins' compound, his teenaged son, J.J., chases his dog through the woods. He encounters an FBI patrol, who shoot the dog as it rushes towards them. J.J. raises his rifle and is also shot. As the patrollers tend to J.J., they are ambushed by Bo (David Maldonado) and several of his friends. They take J.J. as well as a hostage: Agent Goodman. Two paramedics are permitted into the compound to extract the severely wounded J.J. One of them secretly plants a listening device, enabling the FBI detail to monitor the conversations inside. At the hospital, a man (Costa Ronin) enters and puts on scrubs, posing as a doctor. He sneaks into the room where J.J. is being treated, takes several photos from behind the curtain, and gets away undetected. Carrie, not wanting to deal with the side effects of Seroquel, buys some black market meds from Josh (Alex Hurt), and asks Dante (Morgan Spector) to help her manage her medication levels. Carrie also proposes to Dante a plan to connect Wellington to Simone Martin's dealings, but warns that it's \\"completely illegal\\". Dante agrees to collaborate with her. On television, a news report breaks that J.J. was left to bleed out and die alone at the hospital. A photo is shown: one of the photos taken by the hospital intruder, with the doctors edited out of the image and blood digitally added. Agent Maslin (Matt Servitto) sees the report and declares that it's not true, as he had just been in touch with the hospital and learned that J.J. was stable. Saul (Mandy Patinkin) frantically calls O'Keefe (Jake Weber), urging him to relay the truth to the Elkins family, but O'Keefe hesitates. Bo Elkins sees the report on TV. Enraged, he executes Agent Goodman in response. Via the listening device, Maslin hears the gunshot and orders an immediate assault on the compound. A major firefight ensues as O'Keefe hides in the basement. After the battle ends, O'Keefe uneasily walks past the bodies of his fallen allies as he is taken into FBI custody.

President Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) makes pleas to the wives of the FBI agents who were killed in Lucasville, asking them to also attend the memorial. The wives are received with hostility by the attendees until Mary Elkins greets them and invites them to sit with her. The evening proceeds without major incident. After O'Keefe (Jake Weber) insists he had nothing to do with planting the story, Saul (Mandy Patinkin) comes up with a working theory — the fake news story about J.J. Elkins was disseminated by Russia. He visits Ivan Krupin (Mark Ivanir), a former SVR operative now in witness protection. They discuss Yevgeny Gromov, a Russian who sparked conflict in Ukraine with a similarly fabricated story. Krupin says he doubts that the Russians are behind this latest incident. Saul is unsure if he is trustworthy and requests surveillance to be placed on Krupin. With the objective of connecting the McClendon assassination to David Wellington, Carrie (Claire Danes) assembles a team of friends from her CIA days. Along with Dante (Morgan Spector) and Max (Maury Sterling), the team stakes out Simone Martin's (Sandrine Holt) workplace, along with disabling Simone's car so she stays after her co-workers. When only Simone remains inside, three team members go inside to nab Simone and rough her up. Anson (James D'Arcy) gets Simone to confess that she withdrew $50,000 as a payment for the murder of McClendon, and then demands an additional $100,000 and releases her. Fully expecting Simone to immediately report to her handler, the team is gratified when her first phone call is to their prime suspect, Wellington (Linus Roache). Simone's subsequent visit to Wellington's house is caught by Carrie's cameras.

At a proffer session, she is shown evidence of her cash transactions, which was presented to Paley by Dante (Morgan Spector). Martin requests immunity in exchange for naming the person who ordered her to drop off the cash. When it becomes clear that Martin is going to implicate Wellington (Linus Roache), Carrie (Claire Danes) wants to disrupt the proceedings as she believes Wellington to be innocent based on her surveillance. Dante is able to dissuade her. Not knowing how to proceed, Carrie explains the situation to Saul (Mandy Patinkin). As they recount the chain of events, Saul helps Carrie realize that Dante was the originator of the lead on Simone Martin, and that Dante might have been setting Carrie up from the beginning to bring down Wellington. Saul recruits ex-CIA Russia expert Sandy (Catherine Curtin) and tech guru Clint (Peter Vack) to begin investigating Russia's possible disinformation campaign. When a video of Wellington confronting Simone Martin goes viral, Clint deduces that the video originally came from a network of automated social media accounts —the same ones that disseminated the fake story about the supposed death of J.J.

A stunned Wellington sends a letter of resignation to President Keane (Elizabeth Marvel). Keane pays a visit to Wellington to inform him that she does not accept his resignation, as he is needed more than ever with her administration under attack.

Selection pressures shaping seed size stem from physical and biological sources including drought, predation, seedling-seedling competition, optimal dormancy depth, and dispersal. Double coconut -The world's largest known seed Mechanism Modern seed sizes range from 0.0001 mg in orchid seeds to 42 kg in double coconuts. Larger seeds have larger quantities of metabolic reserves in their embryo and endosperm available for the seedling than smaller seeds, and often aid establishment under low resource availability. However, smaller seeds can be produced in larger quantities which has the potential to produce more offspring and have better chances of some of the seeds dispersing into suitable habitat. This seed size-number trade off has led to the evolution of a wide range in size and number of seeds in response to environmental selection pressures.  Selective pressures  No single event, such as a large divergence in the phylogeny of seeded plants, is seen as the cause of major divergences in seed size. Rather, small events are thought to occur fairly consistently through time with minor evolutionary influence. = Shade = Species growing in shaded environments tend to produce larger seeds and larger seeded species have higher seedling survivorship in low-light conditions. The increased metabolic reserves of larger seeds allows the first shoots to grow taller and leaves to grow broader more quickly in order to compete for what little sunlight is available. A few large seeded trees that occur in closed canopy wooded areas such as old-growth forests are the many oak species, hickory, pecan, and butternut trees. = Drought = Small seeds are seen to be predominant in arid, desert environments. In some desert systems the vast majority of annual seeds weigh between zero and two milligrams. small seed size may be a favorable adaptation in desert plants for a couple reasons. Small seeds have been found to have the ability to store in dry environments for several years without desiccating. Also, in many cases, desserts have rainy seasons that provide opportunity for small seeds to germinate under conditions with ample external resources available. Due to the great importance that seeds germinate when water is available, seeds often sense the presence of water and use it as a cue to germinate. Also, many desert plants have evolved the ability to produce a fraction of their seeds to not germinate at the same time as the rest of the plant's seeds as a safe guard known as bet hedging in which if the majority of a plant's seeds germinate at one time and then die due to rain followed by drought, the potential for the plant to have successful offspring is not completely lost. = Predation = Granivors (those that feed on seeds and grains) can selectively eat either smaller or larger seeds, favoring seeds on the opposite side of the spectrum. Commonly, granivorous predation by rodents, which selectively feed on larger seeds, leads to higher fitness of smaller seeds (e.g. kangaroo rats in desert systems selectively forage on the larger seeds in the seed bank. Similarly, sometimes smaller seeds are selectively preyed upon such as with Australian granivorous ants which are only capable of carrying smaller seeds. = Seedling-seedling competition = Competition between seedlings for limited resources can result selective pressures on seed size. In dense mats of competing seedlings, those from larger seeds have higher survivorship due to their ability to more quickly grow taller shoots, broader leaves, and thus out-compete smaller seeded seedlings for resources. Germinated seedlings from larger seeds could also possibly outlive the smaller seeded seedlings which cannot live as long off their stored energy reserves. = Optimal dormancy depth = If there is a selective pressure favoring the survival of seeds buried deeper in the soil, larger seed size may evolve because of their larger reserves of energy required to emerge from further depths. One such pressure causing this type of selection is the recurrence of fires (e.g. in prairies the heat from a fire can damage or kill seeds near the surface of the soil but leave seeds buried deeper unharmed). = Dispersal = The smaller the seed, the further they can disperse, which can be beneficial for avoiding competition with siblings and the parent as well as having better chances of some of the seeds dispersing into suitable habitat. Dispersal may also lead to greater fitness in future generations if further dispersed individuals are more likely to cross pollinate with an unrelated individuals, leading to greater genetic variation. The type of seed dispersal evolved has been highly correlated to seed size in floras across the world. In general, seeds smaller than 0.1 mg are often unassisted (wind dispersed), seeds larger than 100 mg are often dispersed by vertebrates or by water, and seeds between 0.1 and 100 mg are dispersed by a large variety of dispersal modes including dispersal by a great variety of animals.  Evolution of Seed Size  Since the evolution of the first seeded plants ~370 million years ago, the largest change in seed size was found to be at the divergence of gymnosperms and angiosperms ~325 million years ago, but overall, the divergence of seed size appears to take place relatively consistently through evolutionary time. Seed mass has been found to be phylogenetically conservative with most differences in mean seed mass within types of seed dispersal (dispersal modes) being phylogenetic. This type of information gives us clues about how seed size evolved. Dating fossilized seeds of various sizes and comparing them with the presence of possible animal dispersers and the environmental conditions of the time is another technique used to study the evolution of seed size. Environmental conditions appear to have had a larger influence on the evolution of seed size compared to the presence of animal dispersers. One example of seed size evolving to environmental conditions is thought to have been abundant, closed forest vegetation selecting for larger seed sizes during the Eocene epoch. A general increase or decrease in seed size through time has not been found, but instead a fluctuation in seed size following the environmental conditions of the Maastrichtian, Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene epochs. Today we also see a pattern with seed size distribution and global environmental conditions where the largest mean seed size is found in tropical forests and a steep decrease in seed size takes places globally as vegetation type changes to non-forest.

Founded by Stacy Ratner in 2006, Open Books has since started several literacy programs for kids, and has taken part in literacy events in Chicago. Open Books has two store locations, based in Pilsen and West Loop areas of Chicago. Open Books employs adult volunteers who work in their bookstores, and with participants during literacy workshops.  History of Organization Open Books was founded in 2006 by Stacy Ratner, the organizations' executive director. Ratner attended Brandeis University and Boston College Law School, and later, Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. Open Books began in Ratner's basement in the South Loop, where she and Becca Keaty collected and organized donated books. After three months, they acquired 50,000 donated books. In 2009, Rather opened a storefront in River North. The store held 50,000 books, 10,000 of them being children books. In 2012, 60-80 Chicago Public Schools participated in Open Books programs. As of 2012, approximately 75 percent of Open Books $1.2 million budget comes from bookstore and online sales. In 2014, Open Books opened their Pilsen store location. The next year, Open Books opened another bookstore location in the West Loop. The founders of Open Books learned that over 53% of Chicago adult resident have deficient literacy skills. Ratner, Keaty, and Walter, and additional volunteers then began to promote literacy in the city of Chicago. Nell Klugman, volunteer coordinator for Open Books, confirms that Open Books actions focus on creating access to books and prioritizing time for reading.  Events and Collaborations  On Feb. 14, March 14, and Nov, 14 in 2014, Open Books participated in The Chicago Arts Districts' \\"2nd Friday Gallery Night\\" event. The event is a monthly reception at different art studios and galleries in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood. In July 2014, Open Books participated in Chicago’s first Independent Bookstore Day, where they offered free bags of books to attendees who arrived first. In December 2014, Open Books donated 500 children's books to the CTA annual Holiday train where they were given out at the Red, Purple , and Yellow line stops. In 2016, Open Books had its first Garage Sale event. The event took place on Saturday, April 30 at 10 a.m. until May 1 at 4:00 p.m at Open Books' Pilsen location. On April 29, 2017 Open Books held its second Garage Sale event at their Pilsen location. On March 27, 2018, Goose Island Brewhouse selected Open Books for their Charity of the Month program. On the last Tuesday of the month in 2018, Goose Island Brewery selects a local charity, and then donates a portion of their dinner proceeds for that night to the selected charity. Open Books Pilsen will be holding their third Garage Sale event on April 28–29, 2018.  Literacy Programs = Reading Buddies = \\"Reading buddies\\" is a literacy program held twice a week throughout the school year, where Open Books's staff members and approved adult volunteers pair up with an elementary school student to work on literacy skills such as fluency and reading comprehension for 30 minutes. = Creative Writing Field Trips = Open Books West Loop has a creative writing field trips program for elementary and high school students where they take part in literacy games and activities, before going on to write their own work of creative literacy. After the workshop, all students receive printed copies of the classes works to keep. = Read Then Write = Read Then Write is a literacy composition and publishing program for young authors. Teens read and discuss books from a specific genre and then write their own stories in that style, which Open Books later publishes.

The monocots (or Monocotyledons) are one of the two major groups of flowering plants (or Angiosperms), the other being the dicots (or dicotyldons). In order to reproduce they utilize various strategies such as employing forms of asexual reproduction, restricting which individuals they are sexually compatible with, or influencing how they are pollinated. Nearly all reproductive strategies that evolved in the dicots have independently evolved in monocots as well. Despite these similarities and their close relatedness, monocots and dicots have distinct traits in their reproductive biologies. Most monocots reproduce sexually through use of seeds that have a single cotyledon, however a great number of monocots reproduce asexually through clonal propagation. Breeding systems that utilize self-incompatibility are much more common than those that utilize self-compatibility. The majority of monocots are animal pollinated (zoophilous), of which most are pollinator generalists. Monocots have mechanisms to promote or suppress cross-fertilization (allogamy) and self- fertilization (autogamy or geitonogamy). The pollination syndromes of monocots can be quite distinct; they include having flower parts in multiples of three, adaptations to pollination by water (hydrogamy), and pollination by sexual deception in orchids.  Methods of reproduction = Seed production = Reproducing through seeds is the most widespread method of reproduction in both monocots and dicots. However, internal seed structure is vastly different between these groups. The cotyledon is the embryonic leaf within a seed; monocots have one whereas dicots have two. The evolution of having one or two cotyledons may have arisen 200-150 Mya when monocots and dicots are thought to have diverged. Furthermore, the cotyledons in dicot seeds contain the endosperm which acts as the seed’s food storage, while in monocot the endosperm is separated from the cotyledon. Reproduction through seeds is normally a sexual mode of reproduction, however in some cases individuals can asexually produce fertile seeds without pollination, termed apomixis. = Clonal propagation = Multiple individuals have sprouted from turmeric rhizomes. Some monocots can reproduce asexually without the need for seeds. Clonal propagation is the production or division of vegetative structures which develop into new individual that are genetically identical to their progenitor. These vegetative structures can also form enlarged tubers that function as food storage. Monocots constitute the majority of plants with such structures, mainly in the families: Iridaceae, Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae. There are many different types of clonal propagation, which are classified by the type of tissue propagating. * Rhizomes are root-like stems which usually grow laterally underground and sprout new individuals. Most plants that produce rhizomes are monocots (grasses, bamboo, ginger, galangal, turmeric, orchids, irises, lotus); these include the families: Poaceae, Zingiberaceae, Orchidaceae, Iridaceae, and Nelumbonaceae. * Stolons (runners) are like rhizomes, except they may grow above ground, are not root-like, and always grow laterally. They can be founded in grasses, irises, and orchids; these include the families: Poaceae, Iridaceae, and Orchidaceae. * Bulbs are underground food storage structures made from leaves which cycle through periods of vegetative and reproductive growth. Nearly all bulb producing plants are monocots (onion, lily, tulip, hyacinth, irises); these include the families: Amaryllidaceae, Liliaceae, Asparagaceae, and Iridaceae. * Corms are underground swollen stems that act as food storage; they appear similar to bulbs but are not layered with leaves. New corms will bud around the base of the stem. Corms can be found in irises, taro, arrowheads, sedges, and bananas; these include: Iridaceae, Araceae, Alismataceae, Asparagaceae, Colchicaceae, Cyperaceae, and Musaceae. * Keikis are clonal individuals that grow from the flowering stems of Orchids.  Breeding systems  Monocots can be classified as perfect (having bisexual flowers), monoecious (having separate male and female flowers on the same plant), dioecious (having flowers of only one sex on an individual) and polygamous (having bisexual flowers with male and/or female flowers on the same plant). Plants that are dioecious have no other option but to mate with different individuals, but in all other cases there is the possibility that an individual's pollen may make contact with its own stigma. For this reason, most plants have genetic mechanisms to prevent fertilization from pollen grains that are too closely related to the stigma (self-incompatibility). The mechanisms of breeding systems occur at the molecular level through a biochemical reaction on the stigma that recognizes genetic differences in pollen grains. Depending on the species, individual plants can self-pollinate, individuals plants can cross-pollinate intraspecifically (between individuals of the same species), or individuals can cross-pollinate interspecifically (between individuals of different species) and hybridize. Orchids are known to have weak barriers to hybridization. = Self-incompatibility = Mating with individuals that are too closely related (i.e. with self) may result in inbreeding depression, so it is usually considered advantageous to cross-pollinate intraspecifically, in which case self-incompatibility is utilized. At least 27 families of monocots have genetic mechanisms to ensure self-incompatibility (SI). The most widespread form of self-incompatibility in monocots is gametophytic, meaning compatibility is determined by the genotype of the pollen grain. There are two described mechanisms of gametophytic self-incompatibility that have been shown to occur in four families of dicots (RNase and S-glycoprotein) but none have been found in monocots. However, there is evidence that orchids have an alternative undescribed mechanism of gametophytic self-incompatibility. Homomorphic sporophytic self-incompatibility has not yet been discovered in monocots. In this form compatibility is determined by the genotype of the anther from which the pollen grain was created. Heteromorphic sporophytic self-incompatibility, a mechanism in heterostylous flowers, has been shown to occur in only one family of monocots, Pontederiaceae. Late-acting (ovarian) self-incompatibility has been described in Agavaceae, Iridaceae, and Amaryllidaceae. Grasses have a mechanism of self-incompatibility unique to themselves; they employ two unlinked loci, S and Z. When the alleles at these loci are equivalent between a pollen grain and a stigma on which it lands then the pollen grain will be rejected. = Self-compatibility = Self-compatible (SC) pollination systems are less common than self-incompatibile cross- pollination systems in angiosperms. However, when the probability of cross- pollination is too low it can be advantageous to self-pollinate. Self- pollination is known to be favored in some orchids, rices, and Caulokaempferia coenobialis (Zingiberaceae).  Pollination ecology  Pollination systems in monocots are just as diverse as in dicots. About two thirds of monocots evolved to be zoophilous (animal pollinated). Others are instead water- pollinated or wind-pollinated such as Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, Sparganiaceae, Typhaceae, and most notably Poaceae. These modes evolved to facilitate transfer of the pollen grain onto the stigma. Most zoophilous monocots are pollinator generalists with the most notable exception being the Orchids. Monocot pollen grains are monocolpate, meaning they have one groove; outer surfaces called exines are smooth. = Pollination strategies = All monocots utilize either cross-pollination or self-pollination strategies, as do dicots, but the advantage of either strategy depends on ecological factors such as pollinator abundance and competition. These strategies either promote fertilization with self and suppress fertilization with others resulting in self-pollination, or they suppress fertilization with self and promote fertilization with others resulting in cross-pollination. Strategies also exist to suppress fertilization with other species as reproductive barriers. Pollination strategies have the same function as breeding systems, however they occur at the ecological level or at the level of floral structure rather than at the molecular level on the stigma through genetic recognition  Cross-pollination (allogamy)  Self-pollination can be prevented by both physical and temporal mechanisms that have evolved in response to the interactions with pollen vectors; these mechanisms make cross-pollination easier to accomplish by lowering the chances of self-pollination. For example, dichogamy, which is the temporal differentiation in the ripening of sexual organs, is common in monocots with both protogynous and protoandrous flowers. Herkogamy, which is the spatial separation of sexual organs, is also present in many monocots.  Self-pollination (autogamy and geitonogamy)  Self- pollination can occur with or without the aid of animals. When animal- mediated, sexual organs will be positioned closer spatially and temporally, inverse to the strategies of dichogamy and herkogamy. However, when self- pollination is self-induced by the flower, some unique mechanisms have evolved. In Caulokaempferia coenobialis (Zingiberaceae), pollen is transported via a drop of oil that forms on the anther and slowly slides down to the stigma. In the orchid, Paphiopedilum parishii, anthers liquify and touch the stigma with the help of gravity rather than a pollinator. Another orchid, Holcoglossum amesianum, rotates its anther in circles to transfer pollen into its stigma cavity.  Apomixis (agamospermy)  Apomixis is asexual reproduction through seeds and does not require pollination. It is distributed throughout the monocot clade in Poales, Asparagales, Liliales, Dioscoreales, and Alismatales. Thus apomixis may have evolved once in a basal ancestor and has since repeatedly become lost. = Pollination syndromes = Pollination syndromes are floral adaptations in response to pollen vectors, such as the production of nectar. The Allium flower has six stamens and six tepals.  Floral morphology  Flower structure is more uniformly distributed within the monocots. Monocot flowers occur with parts having multiples of three; usually there are three stamen, three petals and three sepals (six tepals), and usually just one stigma. However stamens in twos can be found in Cypripedioideae while single fertile stamens can be found in Philydraceae, Zingiberaceae, and as gynostemium in Orchidacaea. Furthermore, flower structures that evolved to trap insects to accomplish pollination are found in many monocot genera. In relation to flower arrangement alone, plants with perfect flowers should be most likely to self-pollinate while dioecious plants should be most likely to cross-pollinate.  Animal pollination  Zoophily, or animal pollination, is a method of pollination which utilizes animals as pollen vectors. In order for pollen to affix to animal bodies, a tryphine coating is usually present in zoophilous pollen to achieve an adhesive pollen grain. Visual attractants of monocot flowers mainly come from the coloration of tepals. However, when species with small green tepals are zoophilous other organs can evolve to be visually attractive such as having colored bracts (Araceae, Cyclanthaceae, and some Arecaceae), otherwise attraction is based on scent only. The similar pigments used in monocot and dicot flower coloration have independently evolved. Many monocots produce scent to attract pollinators but perhaps not as many as those that produce nectar.A bee orchid, Ophrys, mimics a female bee as a false reward. Most zoophilous monocots produce nectar as a reward and this nectar is alike to nectar of dicots. Carpellary septal nectaries are common and unique to monocots. Nonseptal nectaries are most often epithelial and positioned on the perigonal nectaries of tepals when occurring in monocots. Also, nectar can be produced in perigonal unicellular hairs, a trait only observed in monocots. Monocots do not have disc nectaries whereas in dicots they are widespread. Like dicots, some zoophilous monocots do not produce nectar and instead offer pollen as the main reward. A few even offer other rewards: oils to bees, starchy tissue to beetles, sleeping holes to bees, and a perfume which Euglossini male bees will collect and present on their legs during mating displays. Deceptive flowers that do not offer actual rewards are much more widespread in monocots than dicots, with the most common perpetrator being the orchids. Orchids commonly provide empty nectar spurs. One genus, Ophrys, is known for its ability to mimic female bees to such a degree that it fools male bees into pseudocopulating with the “female” and thereby pollinating the flower.  Wind pollination  Most wind-pollinated plants do not produce nectar, attractive scents, or petals because they are not adapted to pollination by animal vectors. Grasses are a large wind-pollinated group; their stigmas are often feathery to help catch pollen in the wind.  Water pollination  Monocots account for nearly all hydrophilous or water- pollinated plants. These are monocots that are adapted to use water as a vector and constitute most of the aquatic plants. Depending on the species, pollen can either float on the surface and disperse by wind and water currents towards other surface-floating flowers, or pollen can drift underwater to flowers that are submerged. In the later scenario, pollen is without an exine and stigmas are forked. = The flowering bamboo phenomenon = A few species of bamboos can grow for more than 120 years without flowering. Then at once flowering can simultaneously occur in groves across the world, termed gregarious or mast flowering. This is possible because the trigger to flower is genetically determined and because multiple forests can develop from the clones of one individual. The cause of the trigger is still unknown and unpredictable. During anthesis, or flowering, pollination is wind-mediated but bee pollination has been observed in at least 6 species. When pollination is zoophilous flowers can be fragrant and attract large numbers of pollinator- collecting bees to congregate around the inflorescence and take advantage of this new and abundant source of pollen. After anthesis massive die-offs of all sister groves occur within three years of each other and can have devastating effects.

Background and early life Olive was born in Mbarara District, in the Western Region of Uganda. In 1987, one year after the National Resistance Movement (NRM) captured power in Uganda, Olive met Al Hajji Moses Kigongo, the vice chairperson of the NRM and the two started living together. Moses provided resources and Olive supervised the construction of a residential house at 13 Kololo Hill Drive, in the upscale neighborhood of Kololo, in Uganda's capital city of Kampala. In 1990, three years from the start of construction, the house was completed. The two of them moved into the residence and started to raise a family. Career In 2002, Olive Zaitun Kigongo was elected as the first woman president of the Uganda National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. As of January 2018, she is still the leader of the organisation, formed in 1933, although her leadership has come under criticism and challenge.

It premiered on Game Show Network October 2, 2006, airing for two seasons. Gameplay Two contestants compete in an attempt to answer questions by putting letters into a puzzle, similar to Hangman. Each question has a set number of letters in it, and the letters in it are revealed through unscrambling clues. Each scrambled clue consists of a word or multiple words and one extra letter. The extra letter goes into the question after the answer to the clue is revealed. The answer to the question is displayed under the question, and in order to correctly solve it, the contestant must give both the question and the answer. =Round one= The game begins with a toss-up question where the letters are revealed one at a time. The answer appeared below the question in the first season, but it did not during the second season. The first contestant to buzz in and correctly solve the question would play first in round one. In round one, each question's answer is revealed to both contestants to start. Taking turns, beginning with the contestant that won the initial toss-up, letters are placed in the question one at a time using a randomizer that was stopped with the contestants' signaling devices. Correctly deciphering the scrambled word scored one point for each time the letter appeared in the question, if the contestant did not answer correctly, the letters were placed and nobody scored for that particular word. Once a contestant felt he/she had enough information to solve, he/she would say \\"I know the question\\" and then be prompted to do so. Five points were awarded for correctly solving a question. =Round two= In the second round, the points doubled. Each letter placed in the question was now worth two points and correctly solving the question scored ten. The differences were that a correct answer to a scrambled word allowed a contestant to keep control and the solution to the question was not displayed when a question was first revealed, instead the letters were filled in as the round progressed (no points were scored for revealing them, however). The contestant with the highest score at the end of round two won the game and $500. =Bonus round= The day's winner received an opportunity to increase their winnings to $5,000 by correctly solving one final question. The champion's point total from the main game was converted into seconds and that became his/her allotted time for the round. Once again, letters were placed in the question by correctly unscrambling words. However, the letters could only be placed with a correct answer; this meant that multiple scrambled words with the same extra letter would be played until the champion correctly answered. Once the champion's time ran out, he/she was given ten additional seconds to try and correctly solve both the question and the answer, the latter of which was never revealed until the end of the bonus round. If the champion started to answer before the ten seconds expired, he/she was allowed to finish. Correctly solving both the question and the answer before the ten second time limit expired won the champion $5,000. Production That's the Question was announced as green-lit by Game Show Network (GSN) on September 11, 2006. The series was hosted by Bob Goen and premiered on October 2, 2006.

The delegation, having failed, instead, convinced Iskhak to impersonate the actual Pulat Bey and simply to lead the uprising himself, in which he would declare himself Khan. After assembling an army, Iskhak's army managed to takeover Kokand from Nasruddin Khan, who was proclaimed Khan after Khudayar fled to Tashkent after an uprising on 22 July 1875.

Known for his pioneering research in the archaeology of Buddhism, he won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Chinese Archaeology Association in 2016.  Early life and education  Su Bai was born on 3 August 1922 in Shenyang, Liaoning Province. He was admitted to the Department of History of Peking University (PKU) in 1940, and after graduating in 1944, he pursued graduate studies in archaeology at PKU's Institute of Humanities. In addition to archaeology, he studied related subjects under famed scholars who taught at PKU, including history of Sino- foreign relations under (), Chinese mythology with Sun Zuoyun (), oracle bones from (), and history of Buddhism from Tang Yongtong. His student , the future president of the Beijing Palace Museum, described his knowledge as \\"encyclopedic.\\" He began teaching at the Institute of Humanities in 1948. Career=Research= In 1950, Su began working in field research and excavation. In 1951–1952, he led the excavation of three Song dynasty tombs in Baisha, Yuzhou, Henan, and published the excavation report, The Song Tombs at Baisha, in 1957. Combining his expertise in both history and archaeology, the report made incisive analyses of the Song dynasty society and customs based on the discovery, although he failed to consider the possibility that the paintings in the tomb might depict an imaginary spiritual world rather than the occupants' real life. The report remains influential in academia 60 years after its publication. Su was widely recognized as a pioneer and a leading authority in the archaeology of Buddhism. He began studying Chinese Buddhist grottoes in 1947. In 1978, he published an article in the journal Acta Archaeologica Sinica, which questioned the dating and periodization of the Yungang Grottoes by and , Japanese authorities of archaeology of Buddhism. After a few rounds of debate in academic journals, Nagahiro changed his position and accepted Su's arguments. Su also proposed groundbreaking dating of the Kizil Caves in the Silk Road oasis town of Kucha, revising the dating by earlier German archaeologists. = Teaching = When Peking University established its Department of Archaeology in 1983, Su was named its first head. Many of his students became renowned archaeologists, including Hang Kan (), head of the School of Archaeology and Museology of Peking University; Zhang Zhongpei, president of the Palace Museum; Fan Jinshi, president of the Dunhuang Research Academy; An Jiayao, fellow of the Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and head of its Xi'an Station. He retired in 2004 after a career lasting more than 50 years. He was known as a strict teacher and a meticulous scholar. Even after Fan Jinshi gained renown as an expert, Su disapproved of the first drafts of her archaeological report on the Dunhuang Grottoes. It took another five years' revision before the report was finally published in 2011.  Book collection  In addition to his archaeological work, Su was a bibliographer and book collector. Three out of the four rooms in his home, except for the bedroom, were occupied by his book collection, which by 2010 had exceeded 10,000 volumes and included many rare books. In that year he donated all his books to the Peking University Library, which established the Su Bai Reading Room to host the collection.  Death  On 1 February 2018, Su Bai died in Beijing, at the age of 95.

View of the east side of the Hazel Harvey Peace Center for Neighborhoods building in Fort Worth, Texas Hazel Harvey Peace (August 4, 1907– June 8, 2008) was an important African-American educator, activist, and humanitarian in Fort Worth, Texas. The namesake of an elementary school, municipal building, and library youth center in Fort Worth, Peace overcame racial segregation to provide opportunities for African Americans, youth, and women in Fort Worth, Dallas, and throughout the state of Texas.  Early life and education  Hazel Bernice Harvey was born August 4, 1907 in Waco, Texas to Allen H. and Georgia Mason Harvey; the family moved to Fort Worth three months later. Hazel's father was a Pullman porter on the Missouri and Pacific Railroad, and her mother was a homemaker who also owned a children's clothing shop. An only child and something of a prodigy, young Hazel was reading at the age of four. Hazel Harvey attended James E. Guinn Elementary School through sixth grade, then went to high school at the Fort Worth Colored School, graduating at the age of thirteen. A voracious reader, she spent much of her time at Fort Worth's segregated Carnegie Public Library, where she could check out books but not stay and read them. She attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C., where she became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first black sorority in the United States. Graduating in 1923, Hazel Harvey returned to Fort Worth to teach at her alma mater, by then renamed I.M. Terrell High School, while still a teenager herself. Between school years, she attended summer classes at Columbia University in New York, living at the YWCA in Harlem during the height of the Harlem Renaissance. After earning her master's degree from Columbia, she continued her postgraduate education by taking summer courses at the University of Wisconsin, Vassar College, Hampton University, and Atlanta University.  Career = \\"Mama Hazel\\" = Hazel Harvey married contractor Joe Peace (1908–1959), a graduate of the Tuskegee Institute, in 1938. She never dropped her maiden name, always using her full name, Hazel Harvey Peace. The couple had no children, but she was nicknamed \\"Mama Hazel\\" by her students, whom she considered family. Peace was known as the \\"matriarch\\" of I.M. Terrell High School, working there from 1924 until it was closed in 1972 due to court-ordered desegregation. She spent nearly 50 years at the school, first as a teacher, then as counselor, dean of girls, and, finally, vice principal. She taught whatever subject was needed, including English, drama, debate, and history. Peace launched a children's theater at I.M. Terrell, where kids from local black elementary schools could attend plays, as well as a debate club. Due in part to Peace's tireless efforts to make up for the segregated school's lack of resources, I.M. Terrell became known for the quality of its college-prep curriculum and for producing most of Fort Worth's black middle class. Known locally as a \\"monument to black accomplishment,\\" jazz musician Ornette Coleman, Texas state legislator Reby Cary, Harvard professor James Cash, Jr., and legendary Fort Worth journalist Bob Ray Sanders are among Peace's former students. = College administrator = After retiring from I.M. Terrell, Peace worked in administrative positions at Bishop College and Paul Quinn College in Dallas, Huston-Tillotson College in Austin, and Prairie View A&M; University in Prairie View, Texas. She retired from education in 1981. = Volunteer work = Peace worked as a volunteer in the evenings at Fort Worth's John Peter Smith Hospital while she was also teaching at I.M. Terrell, and campaigned for “equalization” of black and white teachers’ salaries. After her retirement, she became more active in the community, as an advocate for youth, women, and the homeless. She served on the Fort Worth Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, Fort Worth Public Library Advisory Council, the board of the Women's Center of Tarrant County, the United Way, the Fort Worth chapter of the NAACP, YWCA, and the reading program at Bethlehem Community Center in Fort Worth. She was the chair of the Mayor's Task Force on Housing, the Near Southeast Citizens Commission, and the Near Southside Neighborhood Advisory Council.  Honors  Peace was presented with Fort Worth Human Relations Commission's Humanitarian Award in 1977 and 1985. In 1988, she received the United Way's Hercules Award. In 1987, she was nominated to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame, but ultimately not inducted. In 1992, Hazel Harvey Peace received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Texas Wesleyan University, and Fort Worth Public Library's youth center was named after her. In 2001, Peace participated as an Olympic torchbearer in advance of the Salt Lake City winter games. In 2007, the University of North Texas School of Library and Information Science created an endowed professorship in children’s library services in Peace’s honor, the first in Texas to be named after an African American woman.  Death and legacy  The Fort Worth Public Library held a public celebration for Peace’s 100th birthday in 2007. She died on June 8, 2008 at the age of 100 and was buried alongside her husband at Cedar Hill Memorial Park in Arlington, Texas. Peace made a lasting impact on Fort Worth and the educational community, leaving the proceeds of her estate to Howard University, Texas Wesleyan University, the Fort Worth Public Library Foundation, and Our Mother of Mercy Catholic Elementary School. Peace’s popularity was such that hers was the first public black funeral in Fort Worth, and memorials to Hazel Harvey Peace were entered into the remarks of the U.S. House of Representatives and Congressional Record by U.S. Representatives Michael Burgess and Kay Granger. In 2009, the City of Fort Worth named its newest municipal building, the Hazel Harvey Peace Center for Neighborhoods, in honor of this local neighborhood advocate. In 2010, Fort Worth ISD opened the Hazel Harvey Peace Elementary School in southwest Fort Worth.

The Cistercian abbey had been founded by Edward I in 1274 as a result of a vow made after a rough channel crossing. The abbey was unpopular with the locals from the start, as it was granted, as part of its endowment, exclusive forest- and other feudal rights which the local villages had come to see as their own. Moreover, the rigorous enforcement of these rights by successive abbots was felt to be excessively harsh. The villagers resented being treated as serfs and made repeated attempts to reject the abbey's feudal overlordship. The villagers' efforts ranged from appeals to the abbot, the King's Chief Justice in Cheshire and even to the King and Queen (who may have been somewhat sympathetic). They were repeatedly unsuccessful, and were unable secure release them from their villeinhood. The abbots, for their part, may have had significant financial pressures upon them (Vale Royal had lost much of its royal funding following Edward I's Welsh campaign diverted both his money and masons from them), and this may have accounted for their strict enforcement of their rights. Either way, their tenants' struggle turned increasingly violent from 1326. The struggle was led by the villagers of Darnhall, who conspired with their neighbours, particularly those from the nearby village of Over. On a number of occasions, when their appeals failed, they were subsequently imprisoned and fined by their abbot. On one occasion the villagers of Darnhall and Over followed their abbot across England in order to appeal to the fifth abbot, Peter, who was meeting with the King in Rutland, appealing for royal assistance against his recalcitrant tenantry. The villagers met Peter on his return journey; an affray broke out, a clerk of the abbot's was killed, and the villagers captured the abbot and his entourage. The King soon intervened and released him; the abbot then promptly had the villagers imprisoned again. Abbot Peter did not confine himself to confronting his serfs: he seems to have acted in a similarly high-handed fashion to the local gentry, and this resulted in Peter's killing in 1339. Background The Cistercian Abbey of Vale Royal, in the Weaver Valley, was originally founded by the Lord Edward (later King Edward I) in 1274, in gratitude for his safe passage through a storm on the return from his crusade. Originally intended to be a grand structure with a complement of 100 monks, it soon fell victim to the financing of Edward I's Welsh wars. The King's campaigns meant that both money and stonemasons were diverted from the construction of the abbey, making not only its future expansion, but the current sustenance, precarious. The new institution was unpopular in its locale, as its existence and the grants of land required — locals claimed — impinged on villagers' customary liberties. The abbey was, for example, granted the forestry rights and free warren of Darnhall. Relations between the abbey and its tenantry had thus, since the arrival of the new monks, also been precarious. In 1275, only a year after the abbey's foundation, tenants of Darnhall attempted to withdraw from paying the abbot customs and services, a position from which they would not withdraw, but rather would push with increasing vigour for the next fifty years. They complained directly to King Edward I, and brought with them their iron ploughshares. The King refused to countenance their position, telling them that \\"villeins you have come, and as villeins you shall return.\\" They complained again in 1307, but again with no success; an inquest into their situation held by the Justiciar of Chester merely confirmed their bondage for them. In 1320, during the abbacy of Richard of Evesham, one of his monks was attacked (and a servant killed) while collecting tithes in Darnhall. Abbots were not just abbots; they were also feudal lords, and as such should not be assumed to be sympathetic landlords purely on account of their ecclesiastical position. After all, when their tenants appeared before the abbot's manorial court, they were not appearing before an abbot, but before a judge, and the usual strictures of common law would apply. The dispute spread to the neighbouring village of Middlewich, with villagers demanding relief from the abbot of Darnhall's immunities, which were oppressive to them. Although the villeins of Vale Royal's estate actually owed no labour service to their land, the villagers of Darnhall and those that joined them were still angered by the principle of their situation. Paul Booth writes: \\"they were the victims of the ownership of their manorial estates from the crown to a desperately under- endowed religious corporation.\\" They were probably not alone; theirs was not the only dispute of its kind. Villagers from nearby Middlewich also complained that the abbey owed them restitution for the loss of two salt pits which had been part of the abbey's endowment. Similar disputes had broken out between other abbeys and their tenants too. To the south of London, there was one such feud between the tenants of Tooting and Bec Abbey. This had also gone from litigation to outright violence and law-breaking, and again had lasted many years. Likewise, Bec Abbey's tenants in Ogbourne St George launched a \\"thoroughly organised peasant's revolt\\" in 1309, which also found some support amongst local gentry. In the east, there was a similar tenant's revolt against the Abbot of Bury St Edmunds Abbey in 1327 which were similar to the later struggles of Darnhall and Over. That abbey's chronicler, Jocelin of Brakelond, railed against all tenants who rose up against their lords, claiming that they \\"waxed fat\\" against the abbeys. The revolt of Darnhall and Over was thus one of many small villein uprisings before the Peasants' Revolt of June 1381. The dispute In 1327 the abbot drew up a custumal for the villages of Darnhall and Over, clearly with the intention of reinforcing claims upon those tenants' villeinage which had historically been belonged to his abbey, but which had not been enforced for some time. The following year, a bitter struggle erupted in Darnhall. The village was a manor of the local Cistercian Abbey at Vale Royal, and relations between the abbot and his tenants had broken down. Ever since King Edward II had granted the village to the abbey, the villagers (now the abbot's villeins) in historian Richard Hilton's words, \\"appear to have been fighting against a real social degradation\\". It has been suggested that if the abbey was as poor as has been assumed, then this may account for the monks having to be extra harsh landlords. Ultimately though, it is impossible to be certain as to whether the abbey was as locally tyrannous as the villagers claimed. It is possible that previous earls of Chester had been lax in their enforcement of serfdom, and that the two villages had got used to their relative freedoms. It is also possible that it was the monks who had been too lax in their enforcement, and that the villagers of Darnhall and surrounding areas saw an opportunity to take advantage of them. There were at least four occasions of emancipatory manumission (without payment, unusually) taking place in the Vale Royal records between 1329 and 1340, and one scholar has noted \\"an element of irony in the fact that the one corporate body which is known to have liberated any native is also the most distinguished for its rigid insistence on its legal rights over bondmen.\\" It would certainly appear the case that the monks approached the landlordly duties with zeal, but also that the manumissions that did occur were insufficient to quell the villagers' ire. Either way, the two villages not only must have conspired together (\\"maliciously,\\" states the abbey's own manorial roll), but pooled mutual resources, for their campaign would not have been cheap. Both travel and litigation cost money, from the writing of the petition by clerks to their advisement on it by lawyers. There was no such thing after all, says Edward Powell, \\"as cheap litigation.\\" The tenants' resistance included refusing to grind flour at the abbot's mill, a rejection of their own bondage, continuing efforts to prevent restrictions from the abbot on the leasing of their land, and the concomitant right to lease it out for up to ten years. This resistance in 1328 led only to punishment in the form of fines, imprisonment, and eventual submission. The abbey's ledger book records how in 1329 — as they saw it — the rebellious tenantry \\"plotted maliciously\\" against the abbey's \\"liberty.\\" The Darnhall villagers had approached (on the first of many occasions) the Cheshire Justiciar, claiming to have been granted their freedom by an \\"aforetime\\" royal charter. Although the legal response is now unknown, it was presumably unsuccessful, as, on their return to the village, they were thrown in gaol until they swore an oath to cease their complaints. Presumably this oath was under duress, for they did so, and were released, only to send a delegation to the King (at this time in the north) on the same matter. It is unknown whether the party ever reached the King, but it is known to have at some point ended up in a Nottingham prison, for some reason only narrowly avoiding being executed there as thieves. This was followed by a petition before the King in parliament at Westminster, which resulted in a new Justiciar being sent to Cheshire to hear their petition. Before he did, however, he read — and had been immediately persuaded by — the abbey's royal charters. As a result, the villagers were again returned to the abbey for punishment. The abbey's recorder returned to logging similar complaints in 1337 when, again, the tenants of Darnhall and Over \\"conspired against their lords\\" and \\"endeavoured to gain their liberty.\\" Recording how the people firstly complained to the Chester Justiciar, then petitioned parliament, and finally sent a deputation from among their own to present their case to the King at Windsor, the writer concluded they were behaving \\"like mad dogs.\\" This was because even though by now the abbey had asserted and reasserted its rights over them in court, and had always received favourable judgements, the villagers of Darnhall refused to accept their position, refused payment of their customary dues, and reignited the argument. Furthermore, when Abbot Peter attempted to collect the monies owed him by confiscating the villagers' goods, they merely decamped with them. In 1336, the abbot denied the villages of Over rights of admission of burgage in the newly chartered borough; this prompted the Over villagers to join with their neighbours from Darnhall against the abbey, and the tenantry relaunched their campaign against the abbot. They attempted to utilise the law in their favour. As Hilton puts it: \\"They beset the Justiciar of Cheshire, the King himself, and even Queen Philippa in their search for redress of law.\\" Indeed, the latter may actually have supported them. According to all accounts, the peasants plotted by night. The extent to which the abbot was held personally responsible is indicated by the distances that the villagers were willing to travel to confront him. They went to extreme lengths: on one occasion they travelled as far as Rutland to hunt the abbot down and ambush him. = Attack on Abbot Peter = The abbot of the day, Peter, visited King Edward III at the latter's royal hunting lodge at King's Cliffe in June 1336, where he requested royal assistance in his struggle against his rebellious tenants. As he passed the village of Exton he was set upon by what the ledger author called a \\"great crowd of the country people\\" of Darnhall. He was not necessarily in immediate danger; indeed, the same author tells of how the abbot own cellarer rushed, mounted, from the rear of the party \\"like a champion sent from God\\" to defend the abbot. It seems though, that the men of Cheshire were then joined by some locals, and that this resulted in Abbot Peter being \\"ignominiously taken.\\" In the course of the struggle, the abbot groom was killed. However, his release — and the arrest of his captors — was ordered by the King the following day. Peter was released, and his captors were imprisoned in chains in \\"the greatest of misery\\" in Stamford. Curiously, although the villagers had killed a man in the melée, the King soon released them from their chains. Even more surprisingly, perhaps, is the fact that the King subsequently wrote to Abbot Peter requesting that he return to his tenants the property he had confiscated (an order the Abbot ignored). The abbot did, however, reduce their subsequent £10 fine to £4. As they found, the abbot had sufficient political connections and influence in central government to stymie the villagers' suits. The early encouragement that Hilton says they had received from various \\"royal and official personages\\" had clearly amounted to little. The abbot's legal victory did not assuage a serious undermining of his authority, however. As with any lord in the Middle Ages, when his authority was questioned by those of a lower social strata, the law would almost inherently find for him, but (notes Hewitt) it would also \\"be idle to identify legality with justice.\\" It is certainly unlikely that the abbey attained its near-permanent favourable legal position without a fair amount of legal manipulation and chicanery. The villages resorted to further violence, and in 1339 — probably in the course of raiding the abbey's crops or outhouses — they killed both Abbot Peter and his cellerer. Legacy Despite its assertions of right, the abbey was never able to fully dominate its own estate, or to prove itself as the regional lord from which all other tenure relationships sprang. Abbots of Vale Royal continued to face disruption from the populace almost up until the time of the abbey's dissolution by King Henry VIII in 1536. In 1351, they complained that they were \\"so wrongfully annoyed and harassed in many other ways.\\" The late fourteenth-century Edward the Black Prince wrote to the Justice of Chester that he believed the abbots to be \\"wrongfully annoyed and harassed in many...ways by the people of these parts...the Justice is therefore to restrain any persons who from malice are going about to molest or annoy them.\\" And as late as 1442, the abbot moaned that when he attempted to travel to Llanbadarn Fawr, Ceredigion, he was continually at risk of attack.
