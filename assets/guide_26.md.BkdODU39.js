A former Junior record holder in Olympic weightlifting, he also competed in four World Strongest Man contests: 1985, 1986, 1988, and 1992,http://www.theworldsstrongestman.com/worlds-strongest-man-archive.html finishing 8th in 1985, 5th in 1986, and 7th in 1988. Overall, Jean-Pierre Brulois is arguably the strongest Frenchman whose feats have ever been officially verified (along with Louis Uni and Charles Rigoulot). Personal life In a 2005 article, Jean-Pierre Brulois explained to French strength sports specialist Emmanuel Legeard that, as a young boy, he was haunted by a recurring nightmare in which he was being crushed by a truck; weight training had helped him overcome this complex. Jean-Pierre started Olympic lifting at age 14. As a cadet (16 year old), and then again as a junior weightlifter (17 year old), he broke the French records in both the snatch and the clean and jerk, but was then called to fulfill the military service required at the time of all 18-year-old French males. On his return from the military, he was contacted by Serge Nubret who persuaded him to leave Olympic Weightlifting for Powerlifting. In the mid-1980s, Jean-Pierre met with Marc Vouillot, a renowned Powerlifting coach, who instantly understood his athletic potential and started training him. In 1990, he was crowned super heavyweight World champion of the International Powerlifting Federation. He retired soon after for professional, as well as familial reasons. In 1990, Harry K√ºmel proposed him for the role of Hercules in Michel Boisrond's \\"Hercule aux pieds d'Omphale\\" (\\"Hercules at the Feet of Omphale\\").

A short man, he was frequently known as \\"[der] Kleene mit der gro√üen Gusche\\", a Saxon dialect epithet which loosely translates as \\"the little guy with the big mouth\\". Life Early years The father of Eberhard Cohrs was a hat maker, originally from Uelzen in Lower Saxony. His mother Alma, who also worked in the little hat making business, came from the Vogtland. His first ambition as a youth was to become a jockey. His weight of approximately 40 kg justified this choice, but his legs were too short and he fell back on his second ambition, to be a pastry and cake baker: this was the trade in which he was apprenticed between 1936 and 1939. However, war resumed in 1939 and he was conscripted for military service. As the war neared its end, between September 1944 and February 1945 he was a member of the SS-Totenkopf battalion and a guard at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, although he was able to conceal these aspects of his war service from the public during his life. By the time the war ended, in May 1945, his mother had been killed in an air-raid and his father was dying. The performer His first stage appearance took place in the Wei√üer Hirsch (\\"White Hart\\") quarter of Dresden. He then underwent an audition before the \\"International Artists' Club\\" in the \\"Dresden Skala\\" on 11 November 1945, after which he embarked on a career as a variety performer. He quickly found Dresden becoming \\"too small\\", however, and looked for a way to bring laughter to a wider public. In 1947 he succeeded in moving his base to Leipzig, and it was here that he quickly became a favourite with the public, known affectionately as \\"the little guy with the big mouth\\"der \\"Kleene mit der gro√üen Gusche\\" As a \\"young talent\\", in 1948 he also worked in Berlin with the Berliner Kammerbrettl cabaret recently set up by Hans Joachim Heinrichs. The head of culture at Dresden Radio, Ulli Busch (real name Richard Hahnewald) gave him his first big opportunity to work on the radio, and towards the end of the 1950s he moved into television, thank to Heinz Quermann, appearing from 1959 in the by then established television variety show \\"Da lacht der B√§r\\" (literally \\"There the bear laughs\\"). Stage performance would nevertheless feature strongly through the rest of his career, and in 1961, thanks to Wolfgang E. Struck, Cohrs made his debut at the Friedrichstadt-Palast review theatre in Berlin. He toured with fellow theatre performers Roby Hanson, Horst Feuerstein and Bobby B√∂lke. He appeared as a regular guest on radio and television, produced records, and took small movie roles. In 1976 he even moved (briefly) into Opera, taking a supporting part in a production of Die Fledermaus at the Rostock People's Theatre ( Volkstheater Rostock). The 1960s and 70s found Eberhard Cohrs in the mainstream of East Germany's entertainment and media worlds. His formula, based on \\"earthy Saxon humour\\", covered themes such as the differences between sophisticated Berlin and provincial Saxony, between \\"high politics\\" and peoples' daily difficulties, and gave public voice to the plight of the so-called \\"little man\\". Although his performances were necessarily apolitical, his brand of humour and his contrived Saxon punning, were not appreciated by every Party Apparatchik, and in the early 1970s he was banned from writing his own material. Early in 1977 Cohrs, now aged 56, succeeded in escaping to West Berlin, \\"turning his back on East Germany for ever\\", and stating that the restrictions in East Germany had become unbearable.\\"...die Beengung wurde unertr√§glich\\" The price to be paid may have appeared to include separation from his wife, Dagmar, and young son, Christopher, but as matters turned out, within a couple of months his wife and son had been not merely permitted, but required, to join him in West Germany, following a decision by East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party to expel them from the \\"German Democratic Republic\\". In terms of television, the Eberhard Cohrs formula did not transfer easily from east to west. His first appearance on mainstream television in the west on Rudi Carrell's \\"Am laufenden Band\\" showThe format of Rudi Carrell's (originally Dutch) show \\"E√©n van de acht\\" / \\"Am laufenden Band\\" became well known to British audiences when it was copied for The Generation Game. was a \\"fiasco\\" according to television chief Peter Gerlach. It was not merely the Saxon's humour that baffled western audiences. Three decades of separation had given westerners little opportunity to familiarize themselves with the dialects of Saxony, and the show was produced in Bremen which, even by West German standards, was a long way from Dresden. The rich Saxon dialect that delighted East German audiences encountered blank incomprehension from studio audiences in Bremen. Nevertheless, during his time in the west Cohrs made further television appearances, for instance in the sketch series Ein verr√ºcktes Paar where he and Harald Juhnke appeared as guests. He also continued to work for Rudi Carrell, providing gags and sketches for Carrell's television shows. Away from the television studios he appeared beside Dieter Hallervorden in a stage version of Nonstop Nonsense at Berlin's W√ºhlm√§use Cabaret Theatre and at the Karl May Festival in Bad Segeberg. His brand of humour never caught on in West Germany to the same extent as it had in the east, however. After the wall came down Eberhard Cohrs returned to his native city, appearing in Dresden at the end of 1989. From the outset it became apparent that his public remained true to his comedy, not merely in Saxony, but across the entire (former) German Democratic Republic. During the next few years he enjoyed popular success and re-established his television career, appearing on shows produced by the Leipzig based MDR (television) company with fellow stars such as Leni Statz, Wolfgang Roeder and Winfried Krause. Personal Eberhard Cohrs married the cabaret performer Lieselotte Homuth in 1945. Following their divorce in 1957 he remained close to their recently born daughter Petra. His second marriage produced two sons, Matthias and Andreas, born in the late 1950s. His third marriage, to fellow variety performer Dagmar Graf, was followed by the birth of their son Christopher in 1972. Christopher died as the result of a diving accident in 1998. Cohrs was diagnosed with Colorectal cancer in 1997. He was immediately operated on. The next two years were characterised by repeated stays in hospital and, towards the end, a growing dependency on Morphine (Medicinal Heroin) to try and diminish the pain of the illness. There was a curious incident on 19 July 1999 when he hit the headlines by shooting his (by now estranged) third wife, Dagmar with an old pistol. Four bullets entered her body, and for about a week her life seemed to be in danger. Michel Neff, a local official, told the press that Cohrs had been so befuddled by morphine and other drugs that he had been unaware of his actions: a lawyer for Cohrs explained that his client had been deeply depressed and that the incident was a tragic accident for which his client could not be blamed. Nevertheless, it was also reported that Cohrs and his wife had become separated and that she had found a new life-partner. Reports also mentioned the refusal of the lawyer to deny rumours of family ructions, possibly involving money. The incident appeared to give rise, at least potentially, to criminal charges regarding both the shooting of Dagmar and the possession, without a permit, of a fire arm for which a permit was required. Cohrs himself was vague as to the provenance of the pistol, which he had been given a long time ago, as a present. However, as Dagmar was taken out of intensive care a week after the shooting, the local prosecutor announced a preliminary view that Cohrs was not medically fit to be tried, and added that there was no point in placing him in investigative detention because clearly he was too ill to run away in the event of charges ever being laid against him. By this time his lawyer was explaining that his client had not even recognised his estranged wife. In the event Eberhard Cohrs died at his home at Scharm√ºtzelsee less than three weeks later, on 19 August 1999. He was aged 78. Shortly before his death Eberhard Cohrs disinherited his third wife, the writer Dagmar Cohrs, in favour of the two sons from his second marriage, with whom he had recently re-established contact.

Founded in 2013, it consists of a super-PAC and a social welfare organization. History \\"Climate hawk\\" is a term often used to describe people who work for aggressive steps regarding climate change and clean energy.Some examples of news articles that make prominent uses of the term are  The group seeks out those politicians who support pricing carbon, ending the use of coal, and deploying renewable energy, particularly solar and wind energy. Co-founder and chair RL Miller is an activist, blogger, and chair of the California Democratic Party's environmental caucus. The other founder is Hunter Cutting, Director of Strategic Communications at Climate Nexus. The group was founded out of Miller's frustration that parts of the Democratic Party support fossil fuel. Miller states that within the party, \\"You don't speak out for restricting a woman's right to choose. You don't speak out for the Koch brothers. Yet at the same time, we've got plenty of people within the Democratic Party who think it is perfectly okay to speak out in support of coal.\\" Miller has cited Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer, \\"an open cheerleader for coal,\\" as a motivating factor in the creation of the group. Electoral politics The group works to support climate-oriented candidates in primary and general elections for the House and Senate by endorsing candidates, engaging and educating voters, and training younger people to run for office. The group's strategy includes speaking directly to voters through knocking on doors, phone-banking, and holding rallies. As a super-PAC, Climate Hawks Vote cannot donate to or coordinate with any candidate or campaign. \\"We're seeking to elect leaders willing to take on the greatest challenge facing the next few generations of humanity. Too many Democratic politicians consider climate to be just another issue bubbling below the surface of top priorities, and too many Democrats are willing to excuse Democratic politicians who tout their states' coal and oil resources as long as they're good on other issues,\\" Miller told The Hill. Climate Hawks Vote does not rule out backing Republicans, but it focuses on ranking Democrats since they generally show more interest in climate change. The group is \\"not partisan, but the Republican Party is so deeply entrenched in denying the existence of climate change that if a Republican climate hawk were to emerge, we would look hard at a Republican's willingness to buck leadership as well as the Republican's position on climate,\\" Miller said. Support would depend on not just acknowledging human-caused climate change but having a viable plan to do something about it. In 2014, the group made endorsements in 17 races, and the endorsed candidates won in 11 of those despite it being a tough year for Democrats. Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii was among those endorsed. The group has been credited with perhaps making the difference in his primary election victory, which had a margin of 1,769 votes. Among the races that Climate Hawks Vote didn't win was a long-shot bid to have Paul Clements unseat Fred Upton, chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, after Clements did surprisingly well in one poll.Climate Hawks Vote involvement in the Upton race was covered in these news articles: The group has called for presidential leadership on climate by restricting extraction of fossil fuels on public land, particularly coal from the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming. Climate Hawks Vote endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary \\"after he won an overwhelming 92 percent of over 22,000 votes cast in the group‚Äôs online survey.\\". Scorecard Climate Hawks Vote gives scores to most Democrats and Independents (and a few Republicans) in the House and Senate that measure their climate leadership. Rather than look at votes, the scores most heavily weigh public engagement, such as appearances at climate events, press conferences, and speeches. The group also looks at bills authored or cosponsored, press releases, websites, and congressional caucuses that the legislators have joined. Rated on a scale of ‚àí100 to +100, the group considers each member of Congress to be a climate hawk, a \\"climate duck\\" (one who ducks the issue), or a \\"climate peacock\\" (those who are all show but no action). \\"I want to use [the scorecard] to identify the climate champions,\\" said Miller. \\"I wanted to create a certain toughness that I think has been missing from environmental politics . . . a hard-headed, in-it-to-win-it attitude when it comes to climate change.\\" Other groups produce similar environmental scores, but Climate Hawks Vote focuses only on climate. Scores from groups such as the League of Conservation Voters look at votes but not legislators' intensity of leadership or engagement with the public. Climate Hawks Vote tries to \\"look at leadership, not just votes,\\" says Miller. \\"For example, [Sen.] Amy Klobuchar [D-Minn.] is a popular Democrat with a high LCV rating. I pulled her up randomly, and compared her with Sheldon Whitehouse [D-R.I.], who is our gold standard in the Senate. The last time she mentioned climate, at the time I did this [2013], was in 2008. A lightbulb went off in my head: We're trusting them to vote as a bloc but they're not leading on this issue. We need to measure public engagement.\\" Another difference between the scorecards from Climate Hawks Vote and other groups is that some others use questionnaire responses from candidates in making decisions, while Climate Hawks Vote looks only at public actions and statements. The group considers public statements to have greater accountability. Sen. Bernie Sanders' announcement of his presidential candidacy coincided with the Climate Hawks Vote's release of its first Senate scorecard, in which Sanders was the highest-rated senator in the just-completed 113th Congress. This rating was based in part on his marching on climate with New Yorkers and his sponsorship of bills ranked as important to the group: the Climate Protection Act of 2013 to impose a carbon pollution fee and the Residential Energy Savings Act of 2013 that would have made loans to states to provide rebates for rooftop solar systems. Others high on the list were Schatz, Whitehouse, Ed Markey, and Barbara Boxer. Whitehouse topped the preliminary list for the 114th Congress. On the other hand, Senate leader Chuck Schumer was given a fairly low score and criticized by the group for not connecting climate change with extreme events such as Hurricane Sandy. Elizabeth Warren scored a bit higher but was criticized for not making climate a central issue except for opposing the Keystone XL Pipeline, leaving her 23rd of the 48 Democrats scored in the 113th Congress. She has shown signs of moving up in the 114th Congress. At the bottom of the Democrats were Mark Warner, Jon Tester, Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Manchin, and Claire McCaskill. Bob Casey, Jr., did better than those but tied with one of the few Republicans scored, Chuck Grassley. Seven Democratic seats were not scored in the 113th congress: Mark Udall, Mary Landrieu, Carl Levin, Kay Hagan, Tim Johnson, Jay Rockefeller, and the seat shared by Max Baucus and John Walsh. Advisory board Climate Hawks Vote's advisory board has included: *Darcy Burner, CEO of TerraHeating, activist, and past congressional candidate *Van Jones, activist, formerly White House aide and co-host of CNN's Crossfire *Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org *Phil Radford, President, Progressive Power Lab *James Rucker, co-founder of Color of Change *Jigar Shah, CEO of Carbon War Room References External links *Climate Hawks Vote web page Climate change organizations based in the United States Political organizations based in the United States Politics of climate change Environmental organizations based in the United States 527 organizations Organizations established in 2013 ","title":"Climate Hawks Vote"},{"id":"46570930","text":"Birutƒó Ciplijauskaitƒó (11 April 1929 in Kaunas ‚Äì 19 June 2017) was a Lithuanian literary scholar and translator.

By the time the first Portuguese ships entered this ocean in the late 15th century, Jewish merchants and persons connected with sea work had lived on, and next to, this ocean for many centuries. As a European presence deepened by the late 19th century in the Portuguese East African colonial capital then called \\"Louren√ßo Marques\\", a cluster of Jews of diverse backgrounds were living there. One synagogue After 1900, the same history became closely connected with the identity and operations of what became the Maputo Hebrew Congregation Synagogue. The Maputo synagogue traces its congregational records to 1899, when political upheavals connected with the Boer War caused the rabbi Joseph Hertz, then of Johannesburg, to briefly move to the Mozambique capital as a refugee. Rev. Dr. Hertz urged his co- religionists in Louren√ßo Marques to take steps to organize themselves as a community, including the commencement of pathways for Jewish education and the acquisition of land parcels for a synagogue and a Jewish cemetery. After a period of community development, these urgings flowered in 1926 with the construction of the Louren√ßo Marques Synagogue, a facility with a congregation of about 30 Jews. Events in Europe led to the Jewish population of Louren√ßo Marques peaking at approximately 500 in 1942. With other organized religious organizations then operating in Mozambique, the Maputo congregation was dispersed in 1975-1976 by the revolutionary Frelimo government and the synagogue was expropriated. The Jewish community reclaimed the building and reorganized in 1989; however, a report dated in 2008 indicates that the congregation had not recovered to pre-1975 levels. The Jewish community of Maputo, which was relatively coterminous with the overall Jewish permanent- residency population of Mozambique as a whole, was in 2008 approximately 20 persons. In 2010 the Jewish community of Maputo officially reorganized as Honen Dalim: The Jewish Community of Mozambique (Associa√ß√£o Honen Dalim - Comunidade Judaica de Mo√ßambique).BOLETIM DA REPUBLICA: PUBLICA√á√ÉO OFICIAL DA REP√öBLICA DE MO√áAMBIQUE, 9 Feb 2010 The original synagogue underwent a complete renovation in 2013.

Alexander Brodie, 19th of that Ilk (17 August 1697 ‚Äì 9 March 1754) was a Scottish clan chief and politician from Moray. He sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain for 34 years from 1720 to 1754, as a government supporter. For 27 years he was Lord Lyon King of Arms, the most junior of the Scottish Great Officers of State, responsible for regulating the heraldry of Scotland.  Early life  Brodie was the second son of George Brodie of Brodie and Aslick in Moray. His mother Emilia was the 5th daughter and co-heir of James Brodie of that Ilk. He was educated at Marischal College in Aberdeen, and possibly also at Leiden University in the Netherlands. In 1724 he married Mary Sleigh (1704‚Äì1760), daughter of Major Samuel Sleigh of the 16th Foot. They had two children: a daughter Emilia (born 1730) who married John Macleod, and a son, Alexander (1741‚Äì1759).  Career  Brodie's older brother James had inherited their father's estates, and was elected in 1720 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Elginshire. However, James died later that year aged 25, and Alexander succeeded to his estates as laird of Brodie. At the resulting by- election on 29 December 1720, Alexander was elected unopposed in James's place, in the interest of Sir James Grant. The Grants of that Ilk had become the dominant interest in the county since the 7th Earl of Moray, the hereditary sheriff of Elginshire, had been implicated in the 1715 Jacobite rising. After the death of Alexander Grant in 1719, Sir James supported first James Brodie and then Alexander Brodie in the Elginshire seat. This arrangement continued until 1735, when Sir James passed his estates on to his son Ludovick Grant, who took the seat at the 1741 election. Brodie was instead returned for Caithness by the county's hereditary sheriff George Sinclair of Ulbster, who was Brodie's nephew. As an alternating constituency, Caithness was not represented in the 1747‚Äì54 Parliament, and at the 1747 general election arrangements were made for Brodie to be returned for the Inverness Burghs, as part of a plan by Henry Pelham to avoid electoral contests between Scottish supporters of the government.  Lord Lyon  Brodie's loyalty to the government was rewarded in July 1727, when he was appointed as Lord Lyon King of Arms, with a salary of ¬£300 per year (). His predecessor Sir Alexander Erskine of Cambo had been a Jacobite, and the Lyon's office was known to include other Jacobites, so the office was viewed with suspicion. The appointment of the staunchly Hanoverian Brodie was intended to remove those Jacobite connections, and to make the office less Scottish. Brodie was the first ever Lyon not be crowned, and the first since the early 16th century not be knighted when appointed. Brodie fulfilled the office with diligence. He was reputed to have enforced the laws of arms without fear or favour, and removed bogus arms even from senior peers. Brodie attached himself to Lord Ilay, Walpole's manager of elections in Scotland, and was accused of \\"airs of being my Lord Ilay‚Äôs minister in the north\\". In 1733 he fell out with Lord Lovat, and at the 1734 election this spread to a series of intrigues which escalated into a serious disturbance at a by-election in 1735 in Nairnshire, where he put up a candidate unsuccessfully at a by-election in which both sides used force. After the 1745 Jacobite rising, Brodie became an informer. He told the Duke of Newcastle that the Earl of Sutherland had sheltered a rebel, and is reported to have helped gather evidence against Lord Lovat. In 1746, he supported the Highland Dress Bill, insisting that it should apply even to those clans who had taken the government's side during the rising. However, he was magnanimous to staff in the Lyon office who had supported the Jacobites. He intervened to protect them from punishment, ensured that their salaries were reinstated, and won a pardon from a death sentence one of his clerks.  Death  Brodie died in London on 9 March 1754, of heart failure. His body was brought back to Moray and buried at Dyke, close to Brodie Castle. Family His daughter, Emilia Brodie, married Major General Norman MacLeod of MacLeod (1754-1801).http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/macleod- norman-1754-1801 Arms  References  1697 births 1754 deaths Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Scottish constituencies British MPs 1715‚Äì1722 British MPs 1722‚Äì1727 British MPs 1727‚Äì1734 British MPs 1734‚Äì1741 British MPs 1741‚Äì1747 People from Moray Alumni of the University of Aberdeen Leiden University alumni Lord Lyon Kings of Arms Freemasons of the Premier Grand Lodge of England ","title":"Alexander Brodie (1697‚Äì1754)"},{"id":"46571178","text":"Ann M.

Prior to this position, she was the head coach of the Albany University women's basketball team. She was previously the head basketball coach of the Missouri State University women's basketball team. In 2005, she guided the Lady Bears to a WNIT title. Early years Abrahamson-Henderson attended Washington High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, graduating in 1985. She was a basketball player, averaging 44 points per game, and that earned her a place in the Washington Warriors Hall of Fame, where she was inducted in 1992. She was named an All-American to both the Parade and USA Today All-American teams, and ranked as one of the top five basketball players in the nation as a senior. She was also on the swim team, and considered attending college as a swimmer, but instead chose to focus on basketball. While in high school, she competed in the Iowa State Championships and placed first in the 50 yard freestyle, the 100 yard free-style and the freestyle relay.  College  Many schools recruited Abrahamson-Henderson but she eventually chose to attended the University of Georgia, to play for Andy Landers, now a Women's Basketball Hall of Fame coach. In her freshman year, 1986, she helped the team win the Southeastern Conference title. She played one more year at Georgia, but then chose to transfer back to her home state and play at Iowa for Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer.

After graduating from Iowa, she attended Duquesne University, where she earned an M.S. in education in 1992. She spent one year playing professional basketball in New Zealand.  Coaching career  While playing basketball in high school and college, Abrahamson-Henderson had no interest in pursuing a coaching career, expecting instead to become a fitness trainer or run a fitness club. However, while she was at graduate school at Duquesne University, one of the assistant coaches at Iowa became the head coach at Duquesne and talked her into being a graduate assistant coach for the team. She then went to the University of Maine to be an assistant coach for two years under Joanne McCallie. After Maine, she spent six years as an assistant coach at Iowa State under Bill Fennelly, working alongside Brenda Frese who would go on to become the head coach at Maryland. When McCallie took over the head coaching position at Michigan State, she persuaded Abrahamson-Henderson to join her as an associate head coach. Abrahamson-Henderson took her first head coaching position at Missouri State (then Southwest Missouri State). She helped lead the team to two regular- season championships in the Missouri Valley Conference as well as three postseason conference championships. The team made three appearances in the NCAA tournament and won the WNIT in 2005. Following the 2007 season she unexpectedly resigned, and went on to accept an assistant coaches position at the University of Washington. After a single year at Washington, Indiana's head coach Felisha Legette-Jack hired her as the associate head coach. In 2010, the University of Albany persuaded Abrahamson-Henderson to become the head coach where she remained for six years. The Albany team had a losing record in each of the five prior years, but Abrahamson-Henderson improve the team 16‚Äì14 in her first year. In her second year, the team improved to finish second in the America East conference and earn a trip to the NCAA tournament.

Artists who have recorded there include Laura Branigan for her album Over My Heart, Brenda Fassie, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Miriam Makeba, Stimela, and the Soweto String Quartet. The Lion King soundtrack was also recorded and produced at the studio. History When BOP Studios first opened, there was a lack of Western artists visiting because the South African apartheid referendum was underway. Because BOP Studios was located in a Bantustan amidst a politically charged climate and funded by private investments, most musicians in Africa would not use it out of political conviction and most could not afford the recording costs necessary to ensure investor profit.Bridger, Jon (14 November 1992). \\"BOP Works to Overcome Challenges\\", p. 56. Billboard The studios were then taken over by the South African Broadcasting Corporation, which ended in 2003. The studios were reopened in 2006 after being purchased by a consortium based in the North West Province. Facilities and layout BOP Studios was the first recording facility to be equipped with infrasonic monitoring designed by Kinoshita. The acoustic design and building construction were specially made to produce infrasonic energy across a wide frequency spectrum, giving the space an unmatched sound. Tom Hidley and Tom Rast were responsible for the architecture of the studios, which are equipped with custom-made monitors. The consoles in each of the three control rooms are custom built, including a Neve, SSL, and Focusrite. Phil Dudderidge, Chairman of Focusrite Audio Engineering, sold BOP one of ten Focusrite consoles.

It is essentially the same as the standard code, however there are some variations in alternative start codons. The code As in the standard code, initiation is most efficient at AUG. In addition, GUG and UUG starts are documented in archaea and bacteria. In Escherichia coli, UUG is estimated to serve as initiator for about 3% of the bacterium's proteins. CUG is known to function as an initiator for one plasmid-encoded protein (RepA) in E. coli. In addition to the NUG initiations, in rare cases bacteria can initiate translation from an AUU codon as e.g. in the case of poly(A) polymerase PcnB and the InfC gene that codes for translation initiation factor IF3.

The government-owned hotel was built in 1975 in the hope of stimulating tourism. It was badly damaged in 1990, but was refurbished and expanded. However, it struggled to attract guests and in 2000 was put up for sale, and leased for use as a medical school. The buildings were destroyed by a hurricane in 2004. Opening The Niue Hotel was built in 1975. It was on the coast between Alofi and the airport. The hotel was state-owned. There were originally 20 rooms and 40 beds. The hotel was built in the hope of stimulating tourism rather than in response to demand. Its immediate purpose was to provide accommodations for attendees of the 1978 South Pacific Forum meeting. In 1975 the International Labour Organization provided fellowships in hotel and tourism training in Tonga to three candidates from Niue, in kitchen, housekeeping and front office. On their return to Niue they worked at the Niue Hotel. Operations The hotel was managed by the Tourist Board. The Niue Hotel provided superior accommodation to that available elsewhere in the region. The restaurant and bar were housed in a round building in the center of the complex, and the bar looked out over the Pacific. From June to August 1979 the hotel had 289 guests, of whom 113 were tourists, more than half from New Zealand. In the 1980s the premier Sir Robert Rex was a frequent visitor. In 1990 the hotel was badly damaged by Cyclone Ofa. It was repaired and expanded. Reconstruction cost NZ$1.5 million, mainly provided by the government of New Zealand. The hotel was reopened at the end of May 1990. The two-story hotel now had 32 rooms. With the additional 12 rooms there was now enough accommodation to support a regular air service from Auckland to Niue. The decision to lease it to New Zealand interests caused a rebellion by cabinet ministers that almost caused premier Sir Robert Rex to be forced out of office. In the early 1990s the Niue Hotel was the social hub of residents of the island, as well as accommodating visitors. A 2000 travel guide gave rates of NZ$109/125 for single or double occupancy of a room, including breakfast. Rooms were cooled by fan, and had a fridge and private bath. There was also an ocean-view executive suite and a family suite that could accommodate six. The hotel had a restaurant with 100 seats, a bar, gift shop and swimming pool. Closure The Niue tourism business continued to struggle. When the 24-room Matavai Resort opened in September 1996 there were just six tourists on Niue, and the Niue Hotel had no guests at all. In 2000 Premier Sani Lakatani announced that the government would put the hotel up for sale. It had been experiencing poor occupancy rates compared to the better quality Matavai Resort, which itself was finding it hard to attract visitors. In 2000 the Lord Liverpool University George Washington School of Medicine was founded on the island, with the former hotel as its campus. The hotel was destroyed by Cyclone Heta in January 2004.

Coat of arms The former Coat of Arms of Nysa originates from a seal from 1260, presenting a tower with a gate, with a crosier inside - a symbol of the Bishops of Wroc≈Çaw; the symbol is no longer found on a seal from 1290. In 1306, the seal presented John the Baptist; a patron of Wroc≈Çaw Cathedral Church, and the whole Archdiocese of Wroc≈Çaw.

Summary In the book Targowski defines wisdom as good judgement and choice and also states that wisdom can be taught. He goes on to say that wisdom is one portion of the cognitive units that create the Semantic Ladder: Data, Information, Concept, Knowledge, and Wisdom. Targowski also gives his reasons as to why civilization is, as a whole, further behind than it was in Greek times on a philosophical level. He opines that even with the advances in the realm of Information Technology (IT), society remains unable to convert the information at its fingertips into the ultimate form of knowledge and wisdom. This book besides scientific synthesis of wisdom covers also the ‚Äúart of living‚Äù and the decline in human ability to achieve its greatest potential as a global community. Reception Biocosmology gave Harnessing the Power of Wisdom a positive review, stating that it was \\"a remarkable wise contribution to the contemporary cultural world, forming an interdisciplinary theory of wisdom and conception of the wise Integralist civilization. Substantially, this is a significant step towards the integral organization of contemporary social and cultural life, and a valuable piece of information of the integrally organizing essence.\\" Dialogue and Universalism also praised the work and made it one of the main focuses of one of their 2014 issues where they brought in 8 writers to reflect on the work.

Set up  COBRA is designed to prove the validity of the CdZnTe detection technique. The initial setup of the experiment, in 2007, was an array of four 1-cm3 CdZnTe semiconductors. This was then upgraded to 64 detectors in a 4√ó4√ó4 array. The CdZnTe crystals act as both the detector and source material, as nine of the isotopes in this material are double beta decay candidates. The location of the experiment allows for shielding from external gamma rays; to this end, the detectors are also shielded by 5 cm of radiopure electrolytic copper and 20 cm of low-radioactivity lead. 7 cm of boron-loaded polyethylene shields the experiment against neutrons, and the experiment is constantly flushed with nitrogen gas to prevent contamination with radon.

It originated in and is largely associated with Kerman province, where it is produced by women. A wide piece of wool fabric (ariz) is needleworked with colored thread. Pateh needlework is done in silk and with flourishes of paisley patterns. Popular designs include the cypress tree and the sun, both of which are traditional pre-Islamic Persian symbols. History Pateh originated and developed in Kerman province. Although its exact origin is unclear, it is assumed that it was influenced by Kerman rug weaving and thus does not predate the latter. The oldest pateh known is dated to the 18th century. Many valuable pateh pieces are held in art museums, particularly in Tehran. The oldest and most valuable pateh known is kept in the Astaneh Museum in Mahan, Kerman and dates to 1294 AH (1877 CE). It was created over the course of three years by twelve women. Governor Shahab al-Mulk ordered its creation so that it could be dedicated to the shrine of Shah Nimatullah Wali, a dervish and poet who was born in Kerman. Structure Pateh mainly consists of two parts: \\"shawl\\" (ariz) and thread. The ariz is a thick cloth, usually wool, and the thread that is worked into it is colored wool. Threads are dyed naturally, usually with henna, pomegranate, madder or the walnut's green husk. The patterns which are used in Pateh are normally divided into two main groups: \\"The Paisley\\" and \\"The Tree\\". One of the most popular patterns consists of four Paisleys on the corners and a toranj at the center. Sometimes flower bouquets are being used instead of paisley. Another common design is called mihrab in which an arch is being made on the top of the pateh. However, one of the essential parts in a design for pateh is margin which is typically filled with flowers or different kinds of paisley.

He is the god of humans on Niue. According to Peniamina, a Pacific island missionary stationed on the island, the Niue islanders consider Huanaki and Fao as their ancestors, and are central to their early history. There are several legends associated with Fao. Along with Huanaki, Fao was one of the earliest settlers, who swam across from Tonga. It is said that Fao started the creation of the island but was unable to complete it until the arrival of Huanaki. As one of the five tupua, he was said to have arrived on Niue beneath a pool on the reef near the base of the cliffs, and to have then \\"ascended to build a residence at Toga-liulu\\". Another legend states that Fao and the other tupua left Fonuagalo because they felt they had not been properly recognized at feasts. When they arrived in Niue, Fao was only able to place one of his feet on the ground. Huanaki completed Fao's work and the other three gods came to settle on the island. A third legend states that these five gods were lazy and did no work toward preparing feasts. When their parents had prepared a feast, they received no portion of it because they had done nothing to help in its preparation. When they continued to do nothing in preparing feasts, their parents continued withholding any portion of it from them. The five gods then searched for an island where they could live away from their parents. A fourth legend, an account by the people of Avatele, says that the gods lived underground and did not feed their children because they were lazy. Their children were angry enough to come to the earth's surface. First was Fao, who tried and failed to make the tides go out. Another god surfaced and also tried to send the tides out.

The program was born with the aim of building bridges between theory and feminist activism, using different networks, in order to promote and generate a multiplier effect in such a way that it would entail a substantial improvement in women's lives and the construction of peace. Under the co-direction of Langle de Paz and Ben√≠tez, in Washington D.C, the program is anchored in the Foundation Culture of Peace, chaired by Federico Mayor, and located in Madrid, Spain. Origins In spite of the institutionalization of Women's Knowledge International in 2011, the development of this initiative started long before through diverse projects: Project Pro/Woman (1986) A pioneer gender studies program in Puerto Rico. It was created in 1986 and run until 1994 in the University of Puerto Rico ‚Äì Cayey University of Puerto Rico at Cayey, under Margarita Ben√≠tez, as Chancellor. Its goal was to create a community of knowledge about women and gender studies, that actively involved both students and professors. Women's Worlds It is recognized as the most important congress of interdisciplinary feminist topics worldwide; began in 1999, and arrived in Spain in 2008, by initiative of Teresa Langle de Paz, with the collaboration of the University Complutense of Madrid. The frame of the congress was the idea \\"New Borders: Dares and Challenges\\" and the slogan \\"Equality is not a utopia\\", congregating thousands of people from the academic world and the feminists social movements. The key feature of Women's Worlds (WW) congresses is to bridge feminist activism with gender, women's and feminist studies, to improve women's lives. The organization behind WW is Worldwide Organization of Women's Studies (WOWS), founded in 1996.(2008) Mediterranean Voices Project managed by Teresa Langle de Paz and Rosa Pereda. Initially, was established with the support of the Cervantes Institute of Rome , directed by Fanny Rubio, and later with the support of the Menendez Pelayo International University Men√©ndez Pelayo International University, framed within the political initiative of the United Nations-Alliance of Civilizations Alliance of Civilizations. A Manifesto was presented and signed by important feminist figures in Granada in 2009. The target of this project was to bring together different organizations, experts, intellectuals, artists and writers of both sides of Mediterranean basin for debate about the role of women in the construction of peace and democracy. This was done through the organization of an annual congress, and various curses, workshops and varied publications. (2007-2010) Objectives and Vision Women's Knowledge International is a program structured around three ideas: culture of peace, cooperation and non hierarchical knowledge exchange, and gender equality; all three form a logical frame for the activities. Women's Knowledge International promotes synergies that link feminist theory and practice in all fields of knowledge to foster cultures of peace. Gender Equality Gender equality is established as a human right, an end and a means in itself for culture of peace agendas; it conforms a basic element in the constitution of democratic and non violent societies. In this way, the work of Women's Knowledge International is directed towards the achievement of gender equality and the promotion of women's wellbeing and the wellbeing of all, through the empowerment Empowerment of women and improvement of their leadership through education. Culture of Peace Refers to a peace concept that emerged in 1999 from the Declaration and Program of Action about a Peace Culture, approved unanimously by General Assembly of United Nations (http://www.unesco.org/cpp/uk/projects/sun-cofp.pdf/). This Declaration expresses that peace is not only the absence of armed conflict, but the existence of social harmony, wellbeing and equality the eradication of poverty, and respect for democracy and human rights. Promoting equality and democracy are two of the most important principles marked by the agenda of United Nations in 1999, and subsequently endorsed by it in various documents. The promotion of education as well as civil society movements are their main tools. Women's Knowledge International reclaims the necessary active integration and participation of women and of their contributions, in all processes of social construction of harmony and democracies.A reference book on this is Laura Sjoberg, Gendering Global Conflict. Toward a Feminist Theory of War. Columbia University Press: New York, 2013 Cooperation and No- Hierarchy Women's Knowledge International claims cooperation as a key element to achieve gender equality and peace. In this case, cooperation is understood as an exchange of knowledge from a horizontal perspective. Its initiatives establish a learning cooperative framework that look for the complementary nature of scientific and experiential knowledge. The aim is to generate a multiplying positive effect for women that, according to WKI's philosophical approach, is likely to span to all members of a community and society as a whole. Goals and Projects In the first four years of activity of Women's Knowledge International up to this date (2016), diverse educational actions have been undertaken, and different work lines developed around its main goals. Work Lines *Gender and Health Work line directed by Araceli Alonso, Women's Health and Women's Rights in a Global Perspective professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison (USA) University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. This area, seeks to highlight the link between good health and a broader notion of personal and social wellbeing within the frame of respect for human rights. The programs on gender, health and development carried out in the South East of Kenya, by the NGO Nikumbuke- Health by Motorbike, founded and directed by her are of particular relevance for WKI. In 2013, these programs won the United Nations Public Service Award United Nations Public Service Awards, by nomination of WKI- Foundation Culture of Peace. In upcoming years, these projects are likely to be expanded as samples of a successful adaptable development model into new territories like Gambia and Tanzania, or Guatemala, Bolivia and Puerto Rico. *Peace and Democracy-Building Area led by Nayareh Tohidi Nayereh Tohidi ‚Äì Gender and Women Studies professor at California State University ‚Äì Northridge, Islamic and Middle East Studies program director and a recognized expert in feminism in the Muslim world. At the present time, WKI is developing a program focused on women's role in peace and democracy- building in Islamic societies. Actions and dialogue have started in Egypt with the collaboration of the Library of Alexandria Library of Alexandria and other partners from the NGO sector. *Human Rights and Violence Area coordinated by Chiseche Mibengue ‚Äì professor of Hass Center for Public Service, Stanford University (USA) and director of Community Engaged and Public Service. Mibengue is also a writer and United Nations consultant about human rights in Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Democratic Republic of Congo. The focus is on the need to build non- violent societies inside-out as a guarantee for human rights and sustainable peace. Work line coordinated by Nidia Bustillos. An expert researcher in traditional medicine and indigenous cultures in Bolivia. It seeks the establishment of a bond between indigenous women movements through elements related to health, the environment, and the preservation of ancestral practices. WKI is currently working on the possibility of adapting the HealthbyAnyMeans model to Bolivia, under the leadership of Bustillos. Activities Under the idea of establishing a bridge between scientific and experiential knowledge as well as practical knowledge implementations, different activities have been developed *Publications. Within the projects prompted by Araceli Alonso in Kenya, a book is being prepared, explaining the innovate model on gender, health and development, \\"Health by Any Means\\" and its comprehensive approach to gender, health and peace-building. *Curses. Courses addressed to extending and sharing feminist knowledge; among them: Gender and Development; Gender and Conflict - in collaboration with Jaume I University of Castellon, Spain Jaume I University; Sex-Trafficking in partnership with the University of Wisconsin- Madison, USA, and different universities and NGOs in Spain. Study Abroad Course: Spain, Madrid - UW Human Rights and Human Trafficking: Criminalized Economies of Gender and Desire *Creation of Database. With the purpose of encouraging a comprehensive circulation of knowledge, WKI is working on a project to facilitate and bring free access to feminist sources and knowledge produced by women or about women to a wide public. WKI has inaugurated a free digital library together with its partners at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: Women's Knowledge Digital Library at Memorial Library-University of Wisconsin-Madison *UNESCO Chair. WKI has promoted the creation of a UNESCO Chair on Gender The Capabilities Approach developed by Amartya Sen and Martha C. Nussbaum is in tune with the approach to wellbeing used in WKI's programs and Culture of Peace[7] and Culture of Peace with its academic partner, the University of Wisconsin- Madison. This initiative is in correlation with WKI's priorities: developing research, fostering coordination of higher education institutions with non- governmental organizations and social actors, support international North- South-South partnerships, and promote projects around the world in the benefit of women. *Conferences: WKI understands conferences as dialogue platforms among very diverse sectors and participants, and is promoting interdisciplinary events on specific issues concerning gender issues and women: E.g. \\"The concept of Wellbeing in the Study of Sex-Tafficking and Sexual Exploitation of Girls and Women\\" - Universidad Carlos III of Madrid- Instituto de Estudios de G√©nero (Spain); From Structural Violence to Sex- Trafficking - Universidad Carlos III of Madrid (Spain) Bibliography  Annual Report 2011-2013 Women's Knowledge International, available in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRmfeCP3pVU Official Website of Women‚Äôs Knowledge International http://www.womensknowledge.org/#!

A story told is that Fao, along with Laga-iki, Fakahoko, Huanaki, and Lagi-atea, left the lost country (Fonuagalo), because they felt they had not been properly recognized at feasts. When they arrived in Niue, Fao was only able to place one of his feet on the ground. Huanaki completed Fao's work and the other three gods came to settle on the island. Another version of the story is that these five gods were lazy and did no work toward preparing feasts. When their parents had prepared a feast, they received no portion of it because they had done nothing to help in its preparation. When they continued to do nothing in preparing feasts, their parents continued withholding any portion of it from them.

She is the widow of Arthur G. Altschul, a former Goldman Sachs partner and prominent art collector and philanthropist. Mrs. Altschul has been a director or trustee of several nonprofit organizations including the New York Historical Society and Historic Hudson Valley (the Rockefeller Family properties). In 2012, Altschul was given a Woman of the Year award by the Police Athletic League of New York City. In 2013, she received a Carolopolis Award from the Preservation Society of Charleston for her renovation of the historic Isaac Jenkins Mikell House in Charleston, SC. On Southern Charm, Patricia plays ‚Äúthe resident madcap grande dame‚Äù according to a profile in Architectural Digest. \\"Pat quickly became a fan favorite last year and has even drawn the affection of celebrities like Lady Gaga who claimed 'that looking at Patricia is like looking in a mirror'\\", commented TV critic Christine Lo in her blog. Early life and career Altschul was born Madelyn Dey in Jacksonville, Florida in 1941 and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. Her parents were Francis Pearl Sudler Dey and Walter Pettus Dey, a medical doctor who graduated from the University of Alabama and received a medical degree from Tulane University in 1909. Patricia was educated at Marymount School, Olney Friends School, and George Washington University, where she obtained a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in 1964 and then a master's degree in 1965, both in art history and archaeology. She was a lecturer in art history at George Washington University and lived for many years in Georgetown, where she later owned and ran Arcadia, a private art dealership that handled major paintings by such artists as Georgia O'Keeffe, Martin Johnson Heade, Frederick Church, and Winslow Homer. Marriages and social life In 1962, Altschul married L. Hayes Smith. The couple lived in Falls Church and McLean, Virginia, and their son, film maker and television producer Whitney Sudler-Smith, was born in 1968 in Washington, D.C. They were divorced in 1979. Patricia married the doctor and entrepreneur Edward Stitt Fleming in 1989. In 1995, the couple divorced amicably. Dr. Fleming was a longtime Washington psychiatrist who founded the Psychiatric Institute of Washington and the Psychiatric Institutes of America. He was president and chief executive of Psychiatric Institutes of America, a private provider of inpatient psychiatric care, which he started in 1969 and sold in 1983. In 1996, she married Arthur Goodhart Altschul, a general partner in the investment banking firm of Goldman, Sachs & Company from 1959 to 1977 and later a limited partner. He was also one of the founders of General American Investors. Altschul was a prominent art collector, especially of paintings by Neoimpressionist, Pointillist, Nabis, and Ashcan School artists. The Yale University Art Gallery organized a major exhibition of art from the collection. Altschul was chairman of Barnard College and a member of the boards at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, National Gallery of Art, and the Smithsonian Institution. His Overbrook Foundation had assets of more than $150 million. Arthur Altschul died in 2002. While Patricia was married to Altschul, the couple were inveterate party-goers. After the attack on the World Trade Center, a New York Times reporter wrote an article about whether people should attend parties such as the upcoming gala for New Yorkers For Children, given the tragedy of 9/11. She interviewed Patricia and wrote: :\\"'People were saying, 'Should I go, is it right?'\\" said Patricia Altschul, wife of the philanthropist and investor Arthur Altschul. She had thought about wearing black (\\"It seems more sober\\"), but decided on a pale green silk suit, embroidered with flowers, by Oscar de la Renta. \\"Yes, I was going to wear black, but at some point you have to get back to life,\\" Mrs. Altschul said. \\"I think the Mayor [Rudy Giuliani] gave everyone permission to be out with their friends.\\" Altschul's prominence (and donations) helped her to be named to the Board of the New York Historical Society and the Rockefeller family Hudson Hills Trust. She was described by novelist Jay McInerney in New York Magazine as being one of New York‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Girls‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúthe wives (and widows and heiresses) who are the keepers of the benefit circuit.‚Äù The Altschuls were frequently seen with other society types such as Melania and Donald Trump and Pat‚Äôs friends Georgette Mosbacher, Deeda Blair, and Carolyn Roehm, former wife of Henry Kravis and a designer in Manhattan. In 1997, Arthur and Patricia Altschul bought the 15-room Long Island estate \\"Southerly\\" overlooking Oyster Bay from Ambassador & Mrs. Hushang & Maryam Ansary. They hired Mario Buatta to redecorate. \\"The view is sensational, magical, you can see the water from every room in the house,\\" Mrs. Altschul later told The New York Times. After Arthur's death, Patricia decided to put \\"Southerly\\" up for sale and move back to the South. Reporter M.J. Smith commented in The New York Times about the house that, \\"While the allusions to F. Scott Fitzgerald and Jazz Age parties may be trite, it is hard not to think of them when it comes to Southerly, a 10,000-square-foot Long Island estate that is now on the market for $15.8 million.\\" Renovation of Mikell House The historic 1854 Isaac Jenkins Mikell House after the renovation (in 2015) In 2008, Altschul decided to leave New York for Charleston. She purchased the historic Isaac Jenkins Mikell House, an imposing 1854 Greek Revival residence noted for its pedimented portico with six large columns having capitals ornamented with rams‚Äô heads. The house was formerly the Charleston Free Library and served as a public library until the early 1960s when it reverted to a private residence. Altschul was said to have paid $4.8 million for the house. The New York Post noted that it has \\"a picturesque piazza and 18th-century French toilets.\\" In 2013 the Preservation Society of Charleston gave Altschul a Pro Merito Award/Carolopolis Award for her renovation of the house and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. In addition to the main house, there is a kitchen building and separate coach house on the Mikell House premises. Involvement with Southern Charm When Altschul's son, producer Whitney Sudler-Smith, decided to create a reality TV show about life in Charleston, he urged his mother to participate. In Southern Charm, Patricia plays \\"the resident madcap grande dame\\", according to Architectural Digest. She is a \\"straight shooter with a serious pedigree and a ton of clout to throw around...famous for her no- nonsense advice, wicked tongue, and appreciation for a high quality cocktail,\\" says blogger and TV critic Christine Lo. She provides sometimes snarky comments about the misdeeds of younger cast members. Patricia said she hasn‚Äôt lost any sleep over how she‚Äôll be portrayed. ‚ÄúI frankly don‚Äôt care,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI always say exactly what I think and they can do what they want. I just don‚Äôt want them putting up any ugly pictures of me.‚Äù References  External links  1941 births Living people 20th- century art collectors American art collectors Women art collectors American socialites Participants in American reality television series People from Jacksonville, Florida People from Richmond, Virginia Columbian College of Arts and Sciences alumni Lehman family ","title":"Patricia Altschul"},{"id":"46572190","text":"Lage-iki is one of the gods of Niue in Niuean mythology.

Dating back to ca. 1450, it is the oldest building in Vantaa and all of Greater Helsinki. It is also the main church of the Tikkurila Parish. Along with its surrounding neighborhood, the church is a part of the Helsingin pit√§j√§n kirkonkyl√§ district, which is one of the best preserved historical parishes in all of Finland. The Church of St. Lawrence was partially destroyed in a fire on 7 May 1893, after which it was reconstructed in a Gothic Revival style. History The Church of St. Lawrence was built around the year 1450, though records suggest that a wooden equivalent stood in its position as early as 1401. Prior to the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of Lutheranism into Finland, the church served the Roman Catholic Church. It was built as the church of Helsinki Parish, well before Helsinki, the city, was founded in 1550. The parish village with its church was favorably located on a coastal road between Turku and Vyborg. A branch of the salmon-rich River Vantaa ran through the village as well. Burning of 1893 On 7 May 1893, the church was largely destroyed by a conflagration, leaving behind only its stone walls and vaults. Reconstruction was overseen by the renowned Finnish architect Theodor H√∂ijer, who opted to alter the appearance of the church by increasing the sizes of its windows and tending toward a Gothic Revival style. The reconstruction, or as it was referred to, the restoration, was influenced by the cultural context of the late 1800s, during which Medieval architecture was gaining newfound respect in Finland. The church was reopened in 1894, marking the then-believed 400 year anniversary of the building. More recently, the church has been recognized as older, by at least 50 years. Exterior The fa√ßade of the church is reminiscent of other Finnish medieval churches, such as the Porvoo Cathedral. The reason for the similarity is that many churches from that time period in southern Finland were designed by the same person, the anonymous Pernajan mestari, who is presumed to be a German architect. The church has, however, been redesigned to some extent following the fire of 1893, leading to the current design being a mixture of Medieval and Gothic Revival architecture. The fa√ßade features a biblical excerpt (from Psalms 84:10) in Swedish: \\"En dag i dina g√•rdar √§r b√§ttre √§n eljest de tusende\\" (). The roof of the church, prior to the fire, was a tarred shake wood shingle roof. After the reconstruction, it was made into a copper roof. The bell tower. Bell tower The Church of St. Lawrence has an external bell tower located next to the front of the building. It was completely destroyed in 1893 and rebuilt in a style similar to the Gothic Revival style of the church building. The tower has two bells, and its roof is peaked by a fl√®che with a cockerel weather vane. Graveyard The mausoleum of Carl Olof Cronstedt. The church is surrounded by a graveyard, which acts as the primary graveyard for the parishes of Vantaa. Up until 1793, the graveyard remained constrained to its original size, until an inspection deemed it too crowded. Since then, it has been regularly expanded to suit the needs of the growing population. The graveyard's current area is about . Its most notable grave is the mausoleum of Swedish naval commander Carl Olof Cronstedt. Interior Prior to the fire of 1893, the church interior remained largely unchanged throughout the centuries. One change that took place was the treating of the inner walls with chalk; in the Middle Ages, the walls were decorated with Medieval paintings, but by the 18th century, the walls were chalked white. The fire revealed several pre-Reformation paintings on the church vaults, though contemporaries deemed the paintings artistically worthless and \\"primitive\\". Before being painted over again, the art historian Emil Nervander made replica paintings of them, which are currently stored by the Finnish National Board of Antiquities. The main stained glass window of the church was completed after the 1893 fire. It depicts Jesus comforting a pilgrim. In 1853, the church received its first pipe organ. Though destroyed in 1893, the replacement organ replicated the visual appearance of the original. It was adapted for electrical power in the 1930s. The current organ was built in 1976, though it adapts the front of the 1800s design for visual similarity.

Like One Step Beyond, the series purported to tell true stories of the supernatural. Unlike the original, this series had a short run of one season of 25 episodes, 14 of which were remakes. Background Inspired by the syndication success of the original series as well as The Twilight Zone, Star Trek and especially Space: 1999, John Newland and Collier Young who participated in the original series, and Alan J. Factor decided to produce a new version of One Step Beyond to be titled The Next Step Beyond, for syndication. Original series creator Merwin Gerard came back as story editor. Newland returned as series host, sporting white hair and large eyeglasses, otherwise looking the same. Worldvision Enterprises, distributor of the original series, distributed the new series as well. Without the benefit of a sponsor like Alcoa, the series only had a budget of $92,000 an episode. There were several drawbacks. The series was shot on videotape, and lacked the noirish look of the original. Several episodes of the original series were remade. All of the remakes were based on Merwin Gerard originals. The budget limit also limited the series' ability to present stories in other times, because of the lack of period costumes and settings, which had been lavish in One Step Beyond. The budget also meant the series could not afford any big name guest stars. The series was canceled after 25 episodes were produced. After running a few cycles on television, the series disappeared and has not been seen since. Episodes { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" ! Episode # !! Title !! Director !! Writer(s) !!

The line connects with the Nahe Valley Railway (Nahetalbahn) in Langenlonsheim to the east with the partially abandoned Hochwaldbahn in Hermeskeil to the west. It was the primary railway through the Hunsr√ºck, having both passenger and freight services. Originally called the Hunsr√ºckbahn, the change of name occurred as adjustments to passenger service occurred between 1978 and 1984. A nearby railway and former spur route that continues to serve passenger and tourist traffic between Boppard and Emmelshausen now carries the original name, while the original railway was renamed the Hunsr√ºckquerbahn. History The Hunsr√ºckquerbahn was developed in stages. The first stage was completed in 1889, connecting Langenlonsheim with Simmern, the principal town of the region. Further extensions included Simmern to Kirchberg in 1901, Kirchberg to Morbach in 1902, and Morbach to Hermeskeil in 1903. Spur routes to outerlying villages in region were created, but most have since been dismantled. One spur route between Simmern and Kastellaun has been re purposed as a bike path. The railway became an important transport link for the war efforts in both world wars. In February 1945, several viaducts of the railway were destroyed as Allied forces advanced through the region, disrupting service between Morbach and Hermeskeil until repairs were completed in 1950. Direct traffic control was installed on segments of the railway in the early 1960s. The timber industry was the primary user of the railway's freight operations. Localized passenger service was also conducted during the 1970s and 1980s, but they were ended due to budget considerations. In 1990 and 1991, the railway was heavily utilized by the United States Armed Forces during the Persian Gulf War. Upon improvements to the road network in the region, the railway's use declined steeply. In 1996, Deutsche Bahn (DB) transferred freight operations to Waldhof. In 1998, Waldhof was also given track maintenance responsibilities. That same year, the route was deactivated between Morbach and Hermeskeil. In 2003, inspections found that the stretch between Stromberg and Morbach was found to have safety deficiencies. DB petitioned to have the rails removed for that track component, but the Federal Railway Authority declined the application and ordered the stretch to be reactivated for use. An appeal of the decision by DB to the federal court in Koblenz was turned down, with the court stating that the company's obligation to serve the Hunsr√ºck outweighed economic matters. A higher federal appeals court however overturned that decision, citing it unreasonable that future infrastructure investment along the railway was realistic. The state of Rheinland-Pfalz then sued DB, causing the railway to be released from DB's jurisdiction. Status Reactivation to Hahn Airport An abandoned segment of the Hunsr√ºckquerbahn between Simmern and Nannhausen in 2006 In 2005, the Ministry of Transport for Rheinland-Pfalz announced a plan to reactivate the railway for passenger service to Frankfurt Hahn Airport. To demonstrate a commitment, buses connecting the remote airport with the greater Rhine-Main region would be utilized until the railway was re-activated for use. Originally forecasted to begin in 2010, the plan called for hourly Regional-Express (RE) train service between the airport and Mainz and a service to Bingen every two hours. In 2007, the Minister of Transport for Rheinland-Pfalz signed an agreement with DB to reactivate the railway, but stated that the goal to have service ready by 2010 was impractical. The route was to require extensive re-construction, including track doubling in several sections, thus raising costs significantly. Further studies showed that the entire railway required replacement of rails, sleepers, and ballasts in addition to reducing at-grade crossings. Planners also recommended the upgrade of the entire railway in one major project, rather than a phased project. The opposition parties in Rheinland-Pfalz criticized the plan, stating that travel times along the railway would be lengthier than current road travel times between Hahn and the Rhine-Main metropolitan area. They proposed the extension of Autobahn A 60 and/or the upgrading of Bundesstrasse B 50 as a more cost-effective project to improve transport in the Hunsr√ºck. After lengthy delays and political wrangling, newspaper reports in 2011 stated that the earliest possibility to reactivate the railway for service to Hahn would be in 2018, but stated that the project might not happen at all. However, later that year, the state announced the continuation of planning and engineering studies for the project. In spring of 2013, the process for project permitting and approval began for sections of the track, with the Ministry of Transport confirming that the project approval would occur in stages, at the earliest in spring 2016. Saar-Hunsr√ºck Express The Uerdingen railbus model utilized for the Saar-Hunsr√ºck Express From 2009 to 2013, an attempt to reactivate train service geared for tourists was launched on the stretch between B√ºchenbeuren and Hermeskeil, in addition to portions of other railways in the region. The Hochwaldbahn (HWB) Verkehrsgesellschaft seasonally operated the so-called Saar-Hunsr√ºck Express. The company utilized the popular and quirky Uerdingen railbus for its equipment in running the service. The company had to shutter service due to lingering track damage near Morbach. In four years, the service drew roughly 40,000 users on a periodic timetable. The company forfeited usage of the tracks back to DB. The company stated it had hoped to demonstrate to state lawmakers that there was sufficient interest for passenger and tourist train usage in the Hunsr√ºck.

Ma'lum's name is associated with the propagation of Islam and establishment of Muslim rule in Fenchuganj. In 1303, he took part in the Conquest of Sylhet which was led by Shah Jalal. Following the conquest, he established a khanqah in Mahurapur Pargana (now Rajonpur in Fenchuganj Upazila). Life Junayd was born in Gujarat, India in the 13th century. During Shah Jalal's expedition towards the Indian subcontinent from Hadhramaut in Yemen, Shah Jalal passed through the state of Gujarat under Delhi Sultanate governed by Ulugh Khan under the Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khalji. During his time with Shah Jalal, Junaid earned the title Shah Ma'lum for his intelligence, general knowledge and guidance before and during the Conquest of Sylhet in 1303. Death and legacy It is unclear how and when he died, but he is buried in a mazar near his khanqah, opposite the Fenchuganj Railway line in Rajonpur. For centuries, large numbers of devotees have been visiting his tomb, a practice which continues even today. On 2, 3 and 4 January, the urs of Shah Ma'lum takes place. According to legend, Fenchuganj Upazila is named after Fenchu Shah, the guardian of Malum's dargah, who had a habit of sitting at ghat of the Kushiyara River during the evening everyday. One day, he decided to open up a shop in the ghat, which eventually expanded into Fenchuganj or Fenchu's neighbourhood. There is a South Asian cuisine restaurant in Palermo, Italy named after Shah Malum. It is notable as the only Indian takeaway in the province.

History There has been a parish church at the site since the first was built between 1195 and 1198 and consecrated in 1198 by Jaros≈Çaw, Duke of Opole and Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw. The current church was built in two phases. The first stage was built before 1392, when the six-span church was built. The second stage was built between 1424 and 1430, when the chancel and ambulatory were built. St. James's Church was then Nysa's highest building, with its rooftop surpassing other structures in the exceptionally historic part of town.

Sullivan: The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature: A‚ÄìF (Vol. 1, Blackwell: Oxford/Chichester, UK, 2007), pp. 76‚Äì77. She became a Quaker in 1654. Her subsequent preaching took her to Ireland and Scotland, Newfoundland, the Netherlands, Barbados, Alexandria and France. Life Nothing is known of Hester Biddle's family origin, except that she was born in Oxford and brought up as an Anglican. She disapproved of the abolition of the Book of Common Prayer in the Cromwellian period. Her conversion to the Quakers took place after hearing Edward Burrough and Francis Howgill preach in 1654. All her writings appeared under her married name, so that her marriage would have taken place before 1655. Her husband was the shoemaker Thomas Biddle (died 1682), with whom she lived in the Old Exchange area of the City of London until the Great Fire of 1666, and then in Bermondsey, on the South Bank. They had four sons, of whom one died in infancy. She lived in comparative poverty after she was widowed, but received five shillings a week from the Quaker Peel monthly meeting. Hester Biddle died in the parish of St Sepulchre, Bermondsey on 5 February 1697 at the age of 67. Her eldest son Benjamin was appointed as executor of her estate. Preaching and writing Biddle stated that she found \\"Peace of Conscience\\" on joining the Quakers in 1654. Her first two broadsides (similar in content) appeared in May 1665 and proclaimed \\"wo\\" (woe) to Oxford and Cambridge for their financial and ideological domination. These already link her voice (as \\"I\\") with God's light within her, in accordance with Quaker teaching.The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 92. Quaker writing accounted for a high proportion of the work produced by women in the mid-17th century. Biddle and Dorothy White exemplify this output. It is thought that about one-third of the Quakers arrested for disrupting church services were women. However, cultivation of a specifically \\"female\\" tone or subject-matter would have run up against the Quaker desire to merge the self into God.Helen Wilcox: Women and Literature in Britain, 1500‚Äì1700 (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 47. Retrieved 30 April 2015. Apart from the fierce persecution of Quaker preachers in that period, it was still illegal for a woman to deliver an address in public. Biddle suffered a probable 14 arrests and imprisonments and in some cases was beaten as well. However, she continued to produce a string of provocative pamphlets. Her 1662 work The Trumpet of the Lord Sounded forth unto these Three Nations (i. e. England, Scotland and Ireland) was written while she was actually imprisoned in Newgate. Here she insisted that \\"we are not like the World, who must have a Priest to interpret the Scriptures to them... the Lord doth not speak to us in an unknown Tongue, but in our own Language do we hear him perfectly.\\" She also rounded on her hearers for their sinful lives: \\"Drunkenness, Whoredom, and Glutony, and all manner of Ungodliness, Tyranny and Oppresion, is found in thee; Thy Priests preach for hire, and thy People love to have it so... Stage-Playes, Ballad Singing, Cards, and Dice, and all manner of Folly... wicked words & actions are not punished by thee.\\" Her awareness of social and economic equality is made plain in the same work: \\"Did not the Lord make all men and women upon the earth of one mould, why then should there be so much honour and respect unto some men and women, and not unto others, but they are almost naked for want of Cloathing, and almost starved for want of Bread?\\" Biddle's travels within Britain took her to Oxford (1655), Cornwall (1656), Ireland (1659), and Scotland (1672). She also made frequent journeys abroad. There exist accounts of her ministry and travels in Newfoundland (1656, with Mary Fisher), the Netherlands (1656 and 1661), Barbados (1657), and Alexandria (1658). She met other prominent female Quakers ‚Äì Katherine Evans and Sarah Cheevers, and Mary Fisher ‚Äì on her way. Most famous of all was her visit to France (1694‚Äì95). Having previously visited Mary II of England, she obtained permission to address Louis XIV of France, during which ‚Äì in line with her Quaker beliefs ‚Äì she urged him to pursue policies of peace. Her final work was A Brief Relation (1662), which describes how she dismissed the admonishments of the court while she was on trial for preaching: \\"Christ is my husband, and I learn of him.\\" External resource * The text of The Trumpet of the Lord... appears in Paul Salzman, ed.: Early Modern Women's Writing: An Anthology (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 148‚Äì66.

Developed by Playtonic Games, a group of former key personnel from Rare, Yooka-Laylee is a spiritual successor to the Banjo-Kazooie series released for the Nintendo 64 nearly 20 years prior. After years of planning to develop a new game, Playtonic Games initiated a Kickstarter campaign that attracted significant media coverage and raised over a record-breaking . The game follows chameleon Yooka and bat Laylee on their quest to retrieve a magical book from an evil corporation. Yooka-Laylee received mixed reviews, with critics divided on whether emulating its predecessors was enough to make it a successful game, or whether it was purely trying to capitalize on nostalgia. While most critics agreed that it captured the essence of earlier platformers, they also pointed out technical shortcomings and outdated gameplay. A spin-off, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, was released on October 8, 2019. Gameplay Banjo- Kazooie, where the player searches for and collects items in an open 3D environment. Yooka-Laylee is a platform game played from a third-person perspective. The gameplay is similar to that of games in the Banjo-Kazooie and Chameleon Twist series. The player controls two characters that work together to explore their environment, collect items, solve puzzles and defeat enemies. The playable characters are Yooka, a male chameleon, and Laylee, a female bat. During their adventures, Yooka and Laylee explore worlds contained within magical books and complete challenges to collect \\"Pagies\\": golden book pages that act as the main currency in the game. Players can use their Pagies to either unlock new worlds or expand those which have already been unlocked. Yooka and Laylee can learn a variety of abilities, including \\"sonar blasting\\", \\"tongue whipping\\", \\"sky soaring\\", eating berries for temporary powers such as fire breath, and a \\"fart bubble\\" for breathing underwater. Most of these abilities use a power meter that is filled by collecting butterflies (which can be eaten instead to restore health). Each new ability is earned by collecting enough quills to purchase them from Trowzer, a snake salesman who wears pants. Collectibles by the name of Mollycools are given to Dr. Puzz, an octopus scientist, in order to give Yooka and Laylee various transformations that grant them exclusive abilities. Play Tonics are RPG-style ability modifiers that are purchased from Vendi, a living vending machine, and equipped to modify or enhance players' ability stats. Also found in the levels are Ghost Writers, collectible characters who provide various challenges like catching or fighting them, and Play Tokens, which are used to play the secret arcade games that are found once per level, hosted by a low-polygon tyrannosaurus rex named Rextro Sixtyfourus. There are several \\"quiz show challenges\\", similar to the Banjo-Kazooie games. Furthermore, there is another character named Kartos, a sentient mine cart who allows \\"mine cart\\" sequences, similar to those of Donkey Kong Country and Donkey Kong 64. The game features a local cooperative multiplayer mode for two players. There is also a 2‚Äì4 player adversarial local multiplayer mode, with eight different minigames. The game also features an optional \\"64-bit\\" mode, which imitates the graphical appearance of Nintendo 64 games. Plot After their precious book, later revealed to be the magical \\"One Book\\", is sucked up by the evil Hivory Towers Corporation, Yooka and Laylee enter their headquarters to retrieve their property. Fighting their way through the vast company grounds and the levels they contain, they eventually manage to reassemble the book's lost pages. In a final fight against the CEO Capital B, they manage to defeat him and reclaim the One Book. Yooka and Laylee proceed to invite everyone from their grand adventure for a party at Shipwreck Creek, and Laylee decides to lock the book up in a safe so that it appreciates in value. During the credits, it is revealed that Hivory Towers is part of the bigger evil organization V.I.L.E., which still targets the book. Development Former Rare composer alt=A blue duotone headshot photo of a white man with a short haircut in T-shirt In September 2012, a group of former Rare employees announced their intent to create a spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie. They joined under the Twitter handle Mingy Jongo, the name of a boss from the second Banjo game, Banjo- Tooie, with cooperation from ex-Rare designers, including composer Grant Kirkhope. In December 2014, the account was left abandoned and the project confirmed to be on indefinite hiatus by Kirkhope in a Reddit AMA; however, in August 2014 a video game company named Playtonic Games was incorporated by this group, and the account was soon revived under the name of its new company. Playtonic then announced that they were planning a spiritual successor to the Banjo-Kazooie franchise titled Yooka-Laylee, formerly codenamed Project Ukulele. At the start of development, six people were involved. To finance the game, the development team decided to use fundraising website Kickstarter to acquire to start production. Immediately, the campaign attracted enormous attention and the goal was reached within 40 minutes, a record on the platform. Later the campaign made another record for the fastest game to get pledged in the history of the platform. Within a few weeks, the game had garnered from over 80,000 backers. The game is intended as a resurrection and modernization of the \\"collectathon\\" 3D platforming game genre of the late 1990s and early 2000s, with an emphasis on progression by collecting various different items. Some of the collectibles were created using 2D sprites. Additional post-launch downloadable content is planned, which began production following the game's release, with crowdfunding participants receiving this content for free. The game's native language is featured in English, but it also features French, German, Italian and Spanish localizations. Wil Overton, a former artist for Rare, illustrated the game's instruction manual. The game was created with the Unity engine with help from middleware tools. This allowed for bugs to be more easily repaired and the incorporation of ten thousand polygons. The phoneticizing of \\"ukulele\\" was an early idea that went through several versions (e.g. Hawaiian terms Yoku, meaning \\"to eat bugs\\", and Laylee, meaning \\"to fly\\") until the final title \\"Yooka-Laylee\\". Yooka-Laylee features 3D worlds by environment artist Steven Hurst, who also worked on the Banjo-Kazooie series as well as Viva Pi√±ata. The game's characters were designed by Kevin Bayliss, who helped design the modern Kong characters in the Donkey Kong Country series, and Ed Bryan, who designed the characters in Banjo-Kazooie. Originally, character art director Steve Mayles imagined Yooka as a lion, but eventually made him a chameleon and created Laylee as a bat, because of how their abilities could accommodate the gameplay. Player characters were deliberately left without voices so as to enhance player choice. The game's perk system was based upon what was done in video games outside the 3D platform genre. Layered animations were among other things employed to improve character movement. Along with Kirkhope, former Rare composers David Wise and Steve Burke collaborated to compose the game's orchestral score. A soundtrack CD was released and rewarded to certain supporters of the crowdfunding campaign. The increase in memory availability since working on Banjo-Kazooie permitted a higher quality soundtrack. The title character of the indie game Shovel Knight makes an appearance as a non- playable character, voiced by Shovel Knight director Sean Velasco. The inclusion was announced by Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games following the release of Yooka's character trailer in September 2016. In March 2017, Playtonic announced that YouTube personality Jon \\"JonTron\\" Jafari, who was set to voice a character in Yooka-Laylee, would have his voiceovers removed from the final game after making controversial comments on a Twitch livestream. Jafari stated that although it was unfortunate his role had been removed, he understood Playtonic's reasoning and wished them success. Shortly after Yooka- Laylees release, Playtonic announced further updates to the game to address criticism of the in-game camera and controls while adding additional features and various other improvements. Release The game is published by Team17, who also assisted Playtonic with localization, product certification, quality assurance, marketing and general non-developer tasks. The game's funding project was announced on Kickstarter in May 2015. It reached its initial crowdfunding campaign goal of within thirty-eight minutes and its initial highest goal of in 21 hours, at the time becoming the fastest video game in Kickstarter history to reach . Playtonic Games later sent out a public statement thanking all their supporters and promising more updates in the future. The campaign added four additional stretch goals, all of which have been reached. Those who contributed predetermined amounts to the campaign received special rewards related to the game's release. It is currently the highest-funded UK video game in Kickstarter history, passing the previous record held by Elite: Dangerous, earning . with success in the crowdfunding campaign allowing a simultaneous April 2017 release for consoles. In October 2016, Playtonic Games confirmed that the game would have a physical retail release alongside the digital release, and promised backers who earned the digital version the choice of physical media. In December, Playtonic Games confirmed the game would be available both digitally and at retail worldwide on 11 April 2017 for all platforms. In the same update, Playtonic Games announced that the Wii U version had been cancelled, with development duties moved to the Nintendo Switch. The announcement cited \\"unforeseen technical issues\\" as the reason for cancelling it. Playtonic offered Kickstarter backers who pledged for the Wii U version choices of refund or moving their pledge to any other platform at no additional cost. Playtonic stated that additional details regarding the game's Nintendo Switch version would be announced in January 2017. It was later explained that the decision to cancel the Wii U version is unrelated to the console's poor commercial performance, and that some of the developers expressed reluctance to do so. In February 2017, Playtonic noted that a physical release for Yooka-Laylee on the Nintendo Switch was \\"beyond [their] scope\\", and they had no plans for it at the time. In June 2018, Limited Run Games announced they are releasing physical copies for the Nintendo Switch in North America, starting in August 2018. In October 2017, Playtonic Games announced the release of a special Collector's Edition of the game for December 2017, including a statue, concept art, a key chain, and pins. In June 2016, Playtonic announced that they had delayed the game to early 2017 in order to give the team additional time to polish the game. Additionally, it was confirmed that Playtonic Games were focusing their development efforts on the PC and Wii U versions, and originally giving the latter platform \\"the right attention\\" due to greater demand from Kickstarter backers, as well as nostalgia factors. Publisher Team17 assisted porting the game to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. On 1 April 2017, Playtonic released The Yooka-Laylee Rap!, which was a stretch goal on Kickstarter. It pays homage to the DK Rap from Donkey Kong 64, with Kirkhope reprising his role as the composer. Reception Yooka-Laylee received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews on the PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, while on the Nintendo Switch it received \\"generally favourable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics generally agreed that the game recaptured the feel of a classic 3D platformer, but were divided over whether this made the game successful or simply made its gameplay and design feel unoriginal and outdated. Its Kickstarter backers were ultimately satisfied with the final product, despite their disappointments with the pre-release demo being delayed and the cancellation of the Wii U version, with many of those backers being given Steam codes instead of Switch codes. It debuted at number 6 in the U.K. all- formats chart in its first week as well as the number 2 spot in the Australian sales charts in its first week. By 24 November 2018, the game has sold over 1 million copies. The game won the award for \\"Game in a Small Studio\\" at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards, whereas its other nomination was for \\"Action and Adventure Game\\". It was also nominated for \\"New Games IP\\", \\"Animation\\", and \\"Visual Design\\" at the 2017 Develop Awards; and for \\"Game, Original Family\\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards. Many critics praised the game as a successful follow up to the original Banjo- Kazooie games. Steven Bogos of The Escapist positively referred to the game as \\"Banjo-Threeie\\", calling it \\"a nostalgic ride through time, bringing the collect-a-thons from the N64 era into the modern age\\". James Kozanitis of Game Revolution felt that Yooka-Laylee improved on the gameplay and structure of classic titles, in particular the relevance and importance of the collectables. Chris Carter of Destructoid praised the expansive levels and the colorful design, but concluded that due to the throwback designs, it would not be for everyone. Marty Sliva of IGN called Yooka-Laylee \\"a good reminder that this genre, once thought to be dead, still has some life left in it\\". He also noted different aspects of the game that felt authentic to games from the 90s, praising the level design, soundtrack and characters while also criticizing how the game controlled at certain points and stated it was \\"not 1998 anymore\\" regarding frustrating camera movement. Kallie Plagge of GameSpot similarly praised certain aspects such as the collectibles and non-linear structure, while also criticizing the uncooperative camera and in some instances convoluted level design. On the other hand, Colm Ahern was more negative about the game's intention to capitalize on people's nostalgia, especially noting \\"camera issues, ambiguous puzzles, a distinct lack of signposting, and voices that will make your ears bleed\\", while the game itself could not decide whether it was aiming at children or adults as an audience. Furthermore, while he was positive about the first level, he claimed that all other levels in the game were falling short, finding them repetitive and confusing. Chelsea Stark of Polygon noted that Yooka-Laylee was \\"proof that sometimes our fondest memories should stay in the past\\". She called the game's combat mechanics \\"a chore\\" and was critical of the controls. GamesRadar also noted the game's repetitive missions and objectives, with reviewer David Houghton noting that some of the game's power-ups, especially the flight ability, render most puzzles and level design choices obsolete. Spin-off and other appearances A spin-off, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, was announced in June 2019. In contrast to its predecessor, the game is set in 2.5D levels resembling those of the Donkey Kong Country series, although it does contain a 3D overworld. The game was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on October 8, 2019. Yooka and Laylee appear as playable guest characters in the fighting games Brawlout and Mighty Fight Federation and party battle game Brief Battles as a skin for the character Violet.

He lived during the reign of King Afonso IV of Portugal of whom he was his favorite and loyal vassal. His parents were Jo√£o Fernandes Pacheco and his wife Esteva√≠nha Lopes de Paiva, daughter of Lope Rodrigues de Paiva and Teresa Martins Xira. His family owned properties in different parts of the kingdom although its area of influence was mainly Beira in the northern part of the country.  Life The rise of his lineage in the Kingdom of Portugal, a process by which members of the lower nobility gradually displaced the old lineages, began with Lopo Fernandes Pacheco, the first Lord of Ferreira de Aves. A great favorite of the monarch, he was perhaps one of the most prominent personalities during the reign of Afonso IV of Portugal. He occupied several posts in the kingdom: merino-mor (1329); mordomo-mor of Infante Pedro, the future King Pedro I of Portugal; and, member of the king's council. He was also the mordomo-mor (1334-1336) and chancellor (1349) of Queen Beatrice of Castile, the wife of King Afonso IV, and, in 1327 was one of the executors of the will of Queen Elizabeth of Aragon, the wife of King Denis of Portugal. King Afonso IV entrusted Lopo with the education of his children, the infantes Peter and Eleanor, the future queen of Aragon by her marriage to King Peter IV. He appears in 1317 with Infante Afonso and in 1318 was one of the witnesses when Afonso made several donations to the Monastery of Saint Denis in Odivelas. He sided with Afonso against the pretensions of his half- brother, Afonso Sanches and was at his side in 1322 when the brothers signed the peace treaty in Pombar. King Afonso IV entrusted Lopo with several diplomatic missions as the ambassador to the Holy See and to the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon. He was one of the forty nobles who were held hostage to ensure compliance with the Treaty of √Ågreda, originally signed in 1304 and ratified in 1328 by King Alfonso IV and King Alfonso XI of Castile. In 1340, Lopo was one of the many nobles who fought alongside the Portuguese king in the Battle of R√≠o Salado in support of King Alfonso XI of Castile. Due to his constant presence in the curia regis, most of his estates, purchased or donated by the King, were situated along the Tagus in the Santar√©m District as well as in Lisbon and surrounding areas. As compensation for his services to the royal family and for having raised two of the infantes, he received the lordship of Ferreira de Aves from King Alfonso IV \\"... and was raised by King Alfonso IV from his natural status as a knight to the category of rico-homem, jointly with his son Diogo Lopes Pacheco\\". Sepulchre of Lopo Fernandes Pacheco at Lisbon Cathedral Lopo Fernandes Pacheco died on 22 December 1349 and was buried in Lisbon Cathedral, also the final resting place of King Alfonso IV. His sarcophagus, one of the most beautiful ones in the cathedral, is in the Chapel of Saint Cosme and Saint Damian. The most relevant events of his life and his marriage were engraved on a stone slab, commissioned by King Afonso IV, which was placed on the wall above his sarcophagus.  Marriage and issue  Lopo Fernandes Pacheco married twice. His first marriage was to Maria Gomes Taveira (died after 1331), daughter of Gomes Louren√ßo Taveira and Catarina Martins. They were the parents of: * Diogo Lopes Pacheco (13041383), 2nd Lord of Ferreira de Aves and one of the nobles involved in the assassination of In√©s de Castro, the reason for which he had to flee Portugal and seek refuge in Castile. Diogo married Joana Vasques Pereira, daughter of Vasco Pereira and In√™s Louren√ßo da Cunha. * Violante Lopes Pacheco. Her first husband was Martim Vasques da Cunha, Lord of T√°bua and her second husband was Diogo Afonso de Sousa, Lord of Mafra, Ericeira y de Enxara dos Cavaleiros, with issue from both marriages. By 1345 he was already married to his second spouse, Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez de Villalobos, who was still alive in 1367 and was the daughter of the Leonese noble Ruy Gil de Villalobos (died 1307) and of Teresa S√°nchez, an illegitimate daughter of King Sancho IV of Castile, whose first husband was Jo√£o Afonso Telo, 1st Count of Barcelos. Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez de Villalobos was the executor of the will of her nephew Jo√£o Afonso de Albuquerque. The children of this marriage were: * Guiomar Lopes Pacheco (died after 1404), the wife of Jo√£o Afonso Telo, 4th Count of Barcelos. * Isabel Fernandes Pacheco, also known as Isabel de Ferreira, married to Alfonso P√©rez de Guzm√°n, 1st Lord of Gibrale√≥n and of Olvera.

The soil in the area is good and this state is an important agricultural and industrial region. Geography The Mayomb√© Escarpment in the Republic of the Congo rises to and runs parallel with the coast. It is a forested area with high rainfall. Inland from this and at a lower elevation is the Niari Valley. It is an area of savannah and woodland and the rainfall here is lower. The valley has most of the country's agribusinesses and the main crops are coffee, cocoa, sugar, maize, tobacco and palm oil. Livestock is also reared in this area. The River Niari is not used for transport because the navigable stretches are separated by frequent rapids, and where it flows through the Mayomb√© Escarpment there are gorges. Big game such as elephant, leopard and buffalo still roam in this area, especially in the Mount Fouari Reserve. History of agriculture The Niari Valley has an area of about 400,000 hectares. Three quarters of this is fertile land with a deep layer of humus. After World War II, the families of a group of people that had been in the French Resistance in Aubeville, France, moved to the valley to set up a communal farming project. At the time some pioneering French farmers were already located in the valley but there were few native inhabitants in the area. The valley had the advantage of having the only railway line in the country running through it. The new settlers were granted a concession of 5,500 hectares but encountered difficulties in their early years, including plant pests and diseases, droughts and occasionally hailstorms. They did small-scale crop raising, poultry rearing and livestock husbandry, and tried out new crops such as rice, groundnuts and tobacco. Not long afterwards, research stations were set up by the French state which planted oil-palm plantations, built mills to extract the oil, mechanized the production of peanuts, experimented with growing Urena lobata, planted sugarcane and built a sugar refinery, mechanized rice production, and grew citrus, bananas and pineapples. Other enterprises included prospecting for minerals, a tree nursery for limba was established and a herd of about 2,000 N'Dama cattle was built up. In 1970 the agricultural assets and the sugar plantations were nationalised and became a state run organisation, Soci√©t√© Industrielle et Agricole du Niari. By 1978 there had been an 80% decline in sugar production and the company went bankrupt, owing large sums to the treasury. The same year, it was broken into three parts, one being Sucrerie du Congo. By 1988, sugar plantations covered 22,000 hectares, but, after a few good years, the labour force had grown too large and productivity had fallen, so in 1991 the company was privatised once again under the name SARIS-Congo.

It was published by Shueisha, with serialization in Weekly Young Jump magazine from September 15, 2011, until its conclusion on September 5, 2019. It is compiled into a total of sixteen volumes. It is published in French by Soleil and in German by Panini Comics. Plot Terumi Minamoto is a young man born with a feminine face and is considered pretty enough to make people think he's a girl. Because of this, Terumi's middle school years were beset by bullying, spearheaded by the most popular and beautiful girl at the time, Chuujou Tsukasa, as an act of jealousy. Due to multiple acts of forcing Terumi to cross dress, as well as bathing him in sour milk, Terumi developed a fear of women and a hatred of milk due to the trauma. The long term consequence of this also resulted in Terumi never getting intimate with women during his high school years, finding even the act of talking with a woman awkward and painful. Just as he enters Shiun University and makes a promise to himself to overcome the trauma of his past, his father remarries and asks him to move out of the house. Terumi is arranged to live with his aunt, Kaoruko Fujiwara, for the time being. She is an extremely beautiful and talented young woman, who is also a non-tenured professor at his college. When he arrives at her apartment, she drags him into a special project in which he must seduce fourteen different women in the same fashion of the protagonist of The Tale of Genji. As the story progresses over the span of two years in-universe, Kaoruko introduces Terumi to women who share their namesake with characters from \\"The Tale of Genji\\", including his cousin (who happens to be the first); Terumi slowly but surely starts to drop his awkwardness and fear towards the opposite sex. With each woman that he meets, Terumi learns to identify the target's quirks/problems, get them to open up to him and ultimately end up having intercourse with the woman in question. Increasing Terumi's prowess in sex is Kaoruko herself, who is willing to use her body and knowledge of a woman's mind to make Terumi more privy to sexual acts, though she and Terumi never commit incestuous intercourse and stop before it goes too far. Kaoruko also notes that due to Terumi losing his biological mother at such a young age, he has developed a mother complex, explaining why Terumi is drawn to older women and why he enjoys engaging in sexual acts with his aunt. Due to the experiment, however, Terumi is able to speak and sleep with woman closer to his own age. While there have been times during the experiment that Terumi had desired to stop in order to pursue a more serious relationship with the woman in question, circumstances pop up where the relationship comes to an end, forcing Terumi to continue, though at least maintaining a cordial friendship with the targets. Terumi also meets up with his nemesis, Tsukasa, at the same university. Thanks to Kaoruko, Terumi discovers that Tsukasa is engaged in a loveless affair with the University's most popular and influential professor, Konoe. Desiring revenge against her, Terumi orchestrates events that breaks Tsukasa and Konoe up, with Terumi discovering that the object of his torment is not nearly as terrifying as he made her out to be, allowing him to take the first steps in overcoming his trauma. Terumi's actions in standing up for himself also results in Tsukasa developing feelings of affection for her former victim. Subsequent events, such as competing in a beauty pageant against one another, only increases these feelings, with Tsukasa eventually admitting to herself that Terumi has grown strong since their middle school days. After sleeping and/or meeting with 13 targets of the experiment, Kaoruko reveals to Terumi that she is the final 14th target and conducted the experiment not only to further her own research but primarily to enrich Terumi's life experiences as a tribute to Terumi's mother, Kirino, who Kaoruko was close to. Desiring to increase her status and reputation away from Konoe's influence, Kaoruko tells Terumi that she will be moving away to another university but will gift her apartment to her nephew, encouraging him to grow and develop without her influence. As a final erotic experience, Kaoruko and Terumi cross the line with each other and commit incestuous sexual intercourse with one another. One year later, Terumi and the targets have moved on with their lives, all better people for it, with Terumi desiring to become a researcher of Genji's Works upon graduating, following in his aunt's footsteps. The final scene of the story showcases Terumi drinking milk without any problems, signifying that he has overcome his trauma and fear towards milk, women and Tsukasa at long last. Characters Main Characters ; :The main male protagonist, Terumi is a university student who was always bullied by girls since middle school because of his girlish appearance, thus he never got intimate with a woman. This all changes when he moved to Kaoruko's house, where he is tasked by her to collaborate with her project of re-enacting The Tale of Genji in real life, while losing his fear of women in the occasion. His surname derives from the Minamoto clan that Hikaru Genji adopted for being demoted from succession. Terumi's inner kindness and stubborn determination endears him to many women, allowing him to develop many friendships and even sleeping with the targets in question. Due to losing his mother at a young age, Terumi has a mother complex, which Kaoruko stokes in order for him to engage with older females. During the final volume of the story, Terumi at long last crosses the line and sleeps with his aunt. ; :The main female protagonist, she is Terumi's aunt and a literature teacher at his university, specialized in researching The Tale of Genji. She recruits Terumi to participate in her experiment by seducing fourteen different women, each related to one of Genji's lovers from the tale. A quiet, beautiful and mature woman herself, Kaoruko shows no bounds in helping Terumi to grow accustomed to the opposite sex, to the point of using her own body to it, despite the fact that they are aunt and nephew, and even takes his first kiss. At a young age she chose not to be with a man, but changed her mind in adulthood. There have been hints that she might have feelings for Terumi, though she is instead encouraging Terumi to be his own man. She is later revealed to be the fourteenth and final target, taking on the role of Fujitsubo from the Tale of Genji. During the final volume of the story, Kaoruko crosses the line and ends up sleeping with her nephew. Targets Labeled as \\"Targets\\" by Kaoruko, each one of them share some similarities with one of the women seduced by Hikaru Genji, and she instructs Terumi to get into relationships with them, for the sake of her research. ; :The first target and Terumi's cousin, she was close with him when they were kids, but drifted apart as the years went by. Her dream is to ultimately become a librarian, which she accomplishes at the end of the series. After reuniting with her again and several failed attempts to seduce her, Terumi settles on kissing his cousin compassionately when the opportunity arises, which over time, she grew to mind less and less. Hearing that she will only accept being his girlfriend if they do not have sex at all, Terumi refuses, noting it's too unreasonable a request. As Terumi moved on to the rest of the targets, she deals with bouts of jealously, eventually developing romantic feelings for him, though she is too scared and nervous to take their relationship any further. Her best friend is Tsukiko, who she confides her problems with and is a regular reader of her erotic novels. She never finds out the truth that Tsukiko and Terumi have slept with one another at one point. She's based on Asagao no Kimi from the Tale of Genji. ; :Kaoruko's friend and the second target, she owns her own nail salon and because of this, she is too busy to take care of her house chores, thus Terumi offers himself to be her assistant in order to get close to her. Terumi later discovers that Aoi has a father complex and although he later loses his virginity to her, it ends up being brief, as her complex hinders his attraction to her and kills the sexual mood between them when she starts screaming for her father during intercourse. They still remain on cordial terms, with Aoi taking it upon herself to hinder Miya from interfering with Terumi's life, as gratitude due to feeling that she and Terumi are similar for having complexes towards a parental figure. She is based on Aoi no Ue from the Tale of Genji. ; :The third target, Hanada works at a Soba Shop while studying Home Economics at Terumi's university. She is very conscious of her large breasts and thus is very shy around others. She eventually becomes Terumi's first real girlfriend, as well as the first with whom Terumi has sex properly. Terumi once considered stopping the Genji project in order to have a continuous relationship with her, but he ends up learning that despite enjoying his company, she does not truly love him, thus prompting him to move on with it. Thanks to her brief relationship with Terumi, Hanada has learned to grow a bit more assertive and take a bit of more pride in her breasts. It is hinted that she still has affections for Terumi but she never acts on them. She's based on Hanachirusato from the Tale of Genji. ; :The fourth target, Miya is a gorgeous, teacher who works at Terumi's university as the Information Processing Tutor. She once was Terumi's teacher at middle school and since then developed an unhealthy obsession with him, stalking Terumi when the opportunity arises and lining the walls of her apartment with photos of him. After spending some time living with her, Terumi leaves her in order to continue with the Genji project, a fact that she is aware of. She shows up time and again throughout the story, usually to \\"sabotage\\" any relationship Terumi has with other women, which requires Kaoruko stepping in to put Miya in her place. She is based on Lady Rokujo from the Tale of Genji. ; :The fifth target, Shian is a little girl with a very innocent, polite and cute personality. Kaoruko chose her because she wanted Terumi to become more used to younger women after his bad experience with Miya, and due to her similarities with Murasaki from the Tale of Genji. She adores Terumi's company, thinking of him as an older brother, eventually desiring to one day become an exceptional woman for Terumi to marry, a dream she shares with her best friend, Otome. Due to her age and innocence, Terumi cannot seduce her as he did with the other targets, instead aspiring to be a brother figure that Shian can look up to. She is based on Murasaki no Ue from the Tale of Genji. ; :The sixth target, Semi is a bespectacled attractive woman who works as a shop clerk at the university. Fond of drinking and stuck in a rut due to being involved in a loveless relationship with her apathetic boyfriend for a long time, Semi is unable to properly address her problems. This all changes when she spends quality time with Terumi, ultimately \\"cheating\\" on her boyfriend by sleeping with Terumi for the night. Though she doesn't take her relationship further with Terumi, it's implied that she breaks up with her boyfriend at long last, moving on with her life. She still holds affection for Terumi, however, hiding from him in embarrassment whenever he comes around the convenience store she works at. At the end of the series, she quits her job to work as a secretary under Gennai. She's based on Utsusemi from the Tale of Genji. ; :The seventh target, Yuu is a bright and cheerful young woman who works as a fitness instructor for interested parties, making up for lost time since she was always sickly as a young girl. Due to being bedridden most of her young life, this resulted in not having any experience at all with men, until meeting Terumi and becoming his first serious girlfriend, much to Miya's envy. Terumi's relationship with Yuu almost made him decide to quit the Genji project for her sake, but after receiving a job proposal that she couldn't refuse, as well as believing that Terumi had deeper feelings for his aunt, Kaoruko, she is forced to move to Osaka and end the relationship. Though, she later reveals that she is still in love with Terumi but never makes an attempt to resume a relationship. Towards the end of the series, she is still working as a fitness instructor, last seen trying to get Akashi to join the gym. She plays the role as Yuugao from Tale of Genji. ; :The eighth target, Hana is a short, but well-endowed sophomore in the broadcasting department at Terumi's university, who aspires to become a voice actress. Hana is desperate to make friends around her age, since she has a troubled time doing so due to her shyness and high pitch voice. Looking for a partner for an audition practice in an eroge video game, Kaoruko recommends Terumi for the task, with the intent of getting them close. It works, as this allows her to open up to Terumi, eventually ending with the both of them sleeping with one another as \\"practice\\". Grateful for the experience, she eventually becomes friends with Terumi's other female companions, becoming best friends with Hanada over their shared shyness and awkwardness for large breasts. She fulfills her dream of becoming a voice actress towards the end of the series, last seen promoting a product/show as one of the voice actors. She is based on the Safflower Princess from the Tale of Genji. ; :The ninth target, who happens to be the oldest of all the targets, Gennai is an attractive dentist who is bright and friendly at a clinic she owns, giving off the impression that she is younger than her true age. However, this masks her true persona of being a narcissist, who loves to pleasure herself while looking at a mirror. Like Miya, she is aware of Kaoruko's research project and doesn't mind using Terumi for herself. Eventually growing to like Terumi, she engages in sexual intercourse with him multiple times in one sitting, learning to like someone other than herself due to Terumi's skill at pleasuring women and his tenacity. Towards the end of the series, she takes on Semi as her secretary. She plays the role of Gen no Naishinosuke from the Tale of Genji. ; :The tenth target, Ruri is a high school student and sheltered daughter of a local mistress, who strikingly resembles Yuu for some reason. Encountering her at a license training course, Terumi finds that it is her first time in the outside world as well. Marriage proposals have pressured Ruri, resulting in a weariness of men in general. To bypass this, Kaoruko instructs Terumi to cross dress in order to grow closer to her and to protect her from any man with ill intent towards her. Sure enough, Terumi ends up saving Ruri from nearly being raped by her would-be husband, Kurohige. As a result of this, Ruri develops gratitude and affection towards Terumi, though she never discovers Terumi's true gender. She is later seen becoming friends with Nagiko and Akashi, beginning her first year at Shiun University. She plays the role of Tamakazura from the Tale of Genji. ; :The eleventh target, Tsukiko is Asahi's close friend, who loves writing and reading erotic novels. She becomes Terumi's first female friend that he becomes comfortable talking to his problems about, though she tends to let her imagination get the best of her at times, sometimes with startling accuracy. Like Terumi, she also has a fear towards the opposite sex, though it is more extreme in her case, as Tsukiko cannot come into contact or speaking distance with other men, the exception being Terumi, who she finds as a good source material for her novels, as well as his feminine face putting her at peace. Her fear of men started since witnessing her father go through her underwear at such a young age. Due to Terumi cross dressing to ease her state of mind, as well as taking her to a love hotel to improve her worth as a writer, and ultimately sleeping with Terumi, Tsukiko has learned to slowly but surely trust in men again. This is demonstrated when she is able to speak normally with Murakami, who she avoided before. It's hinted that she has romantic feelings for Terumi, insinuating that she would like to have intercourse with him again in the future. She has a younger sister, Nagiko, who she adores and vice versa. By the end of the series, Tsukiko has become a better erotic novelist, though she never reveals to Asahi how her skills improved thanks to her tryst with Terumi. She plays the role of Oborozukiyo from the Tale of Genji. ; :The twelfth target, Otome is a quiet, shy and withdrawn middle school student, who is also Shian's best friend. According to her older half- sister, Otome has no interest in doing much anything, despite having the potential to do better if she applies herself. Kaoruko recommends that Terumi tutor her, confident that her nephew can get her to open up in a week's time. During the week, Terumi discovers, with Shian's help, that Otome loves cats. After promising to reward her by taking her to an alleyway of stray cats that she can interact with as much as she wishes, Otome starts studying more seriously as a result. Along the way, she is touched when she overhears Terumi telling her sister that he admires Otome's inner potential and starts to develop romantic feelings towards him. Later, she becomes jealous when she sees how close Terumi is with Kaoruko, which strengthens her resolve to one day become the type of woman that Terumi would take an interest in, sharing her dream with Shian. Thanks to Terumi's influence, Otome has become more outgoing as a result, willingly taking on Murakami as a tutor without fuss. Like Shian, Terumi does not attempt to woo and seduce her due to her young age. She plays the role of Onna san no Miya from the Tale of Genji. ; :The thirteenth target, Akashi is an alluring fortune teller from the country side who loves playing with tariff cards. Terumi chances upon her pleasuring herself on the temple steps, embarrassing them both. He makes up for this when he demonstrates that he's not a bad person by revealing his relationship with Ruri and even volunteers to help at her family inn during summer break. During this time, she and Terumi bond over men and women's need for sexual pleasure and she starts to fall for Terumi's inner kindness. For the rest of Terumi's stay, she requests for Terumi to become her boyfriend until the summer is over, desiring to engage in sex. She becomes one of the few targets who Terumi regularly has intercourse with multiple times. By break's end, Terumi confides in her his feelings for his aunt, who Akashi encourages him to follow, grateful that Terumi went along with her wishes. She becomes best friends with Ruri and Nagiko. By series end, she befriends Yuu, who is trying to convince her to join her gym. She plays the role of Akashi no Kata from the Tale of Genji. Other Characters ; :Terumi's classmate and close friend. The reason he enrolled at Shiun University was just to be close to Kaoruko, his ideal woman he wants to lose his virginity to. Kaoruko notes that despite Murakami's determination to speak with women, he is ultimately too \\"pure\\" to be participate in her experiment. Having lousy luck with women, Murakami nevertheless tries his hardest, though he occasionally shows jealously at Terumi's ease of speaking with attractive women. Later becomes a personal tutor to Otome when Terumi's time as her tutor finishes. Towards the end of the series, Murakami has let go of his obsession towards Kaoruko and moved on, finally having good fortune thrown his way when it's hinted that he has recently started dating Otome's older half-sister. Murakami is a Japanese family name. His first name is never revealed. ; :Tsukiko's younger sister, who, like her, loves reading about novels, particularly the Tale of Genji. She was interested in what sort of person Terumi is for Tsukiko to speak so highly of him but is disappointed when she first meets him. Nevertheless, she's interested in Terumi's androgynous appearance and can be a bit of a pervert like her sister. Later she warms up to Terumi. She does not harbor the same fear of men like her sister does. Later, she becomes best friends with Ruri and Akashi and even keeps Terumi's gender from Ruri a secret, noting how much more interesting it would be to maintain Ruri's naive delusion. She loves putting up her thoughts on social media. Antagonists ; :A bully from Terumi's middle school, who is the primary reason for his fear of women and milk, due to jealously over Terumi attracting the affections of other men, despite her own popularity and beauty. Presenting a bright and compassionate persona to her peers, Tsukasa is secretly sadistic and haughty on the inside, especially towards Terumi. According to Kaoruko, Tsukasa loves surrounding herself with \\"popular\\" people and things, viewing them as accessories to increase her own status. After six years, Terumi finds out Tsukasa is a student at the same university and that she is engaging in an affair with Professor Konoe. A brief confrontation reveals that she has completely forgotten about him. Offended that the source of his trauma has forgotten about him, Terumi wants her to fall in love with him and get some modicum of revenge. Terumi succeeds after cross-dressing as a girl and \\"stealing\\" away Konoe. After confronting Terumi at a cafe about this, Terumi ends up kissing her passionately, which accomplishes Konoe breaking up with her for good and causing Tsukasa to develop feelings for her former victim due to his new found assertiveness. These feelings increase whenever Tsukasa engages with Terumi and attempts to put him down, with others noting that she's starting to fall for Terumi. Later on, she admits to herself that Terumi has grown stronger since their middle school days, finding that quality about him to face adversity the most attractive thing about him. Ultimately, however, nothing comes of this. Eventually, Terumi gets over his trauma regarding her. ; : An influential professor at Shiun University, who, according to Kaoruko, is the most popular male professor the university has to offer. Despite being married and having a child, he regularly cheats on his wife with other women. His most recent mistress is Chuujou Tsukasa, with the two regularly sneaking off to an abandoned part of the University to have sex. They are discovered by Terumi and Tsukasa threatens to break it off with him. At first, desperate to maintain a sexual relationship with his attractive student, he calls her multiple times to give him another chance. However, this all changes when Terumi, cross-dressing as a woman, successfully \\"seduces\\" Konoe's affections away from Tsukasa, angering her. Later, witnessing Terumi and Tsukasa kissing one another passionately at a crowded cafe, he breaks things off with her permanently, subtlety telling Tsukasa to \\"mind her surroundings\\". This causes Terumi to condemn him in private, noting to Tsukasa that her taste in men is flawed since Konoe is too cowardly to stand up for his mistress' honor, caring more about his reputation than her, effectively shaming her into silence. Later, Konoe is seen again during the Beauty Pageant arc, and like many of her admirers, he desires to sleep with Kaoruko, betting on the result of the pageant for a chance to sleep with his colleague in exchange for using his influence to help Kaoruko' standing in the university should he lose. Thankfully, nothing comes of it in the end. Konoe does not show up again for the rest of the series but his presence can still be felt; Kaoruko ultimately desires to move from Shiun University to teach elsewhere, wanting to get away from Konoe's influence and allow herself to grow without interference.

The tunnelling units were occupied in offensive and defensive mining involving the placing and maintaining of mines under enemy lines, as well as other underground work such as the construction of deep dugouts for troop accommodation, the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches and underground chambers for signals and medical services.The Tunnelling Companies RE , access date 25 April 2015 Background By January 1915 it had become evident to the BEF at the Western Front that the Germans were mining to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter- tactics or underground listening devices before the war, field marshals French and Kitchener agreed to investigate the suitability of forming British mining units. Following consultations between the Engineer-in-Chief of the BEF, Brigadier George Fowke, and the mining specialist John Norton-Griffiths, the War Office formally approved the tunnelling company scheme on 19 February 1915. Norton-Griffiths ensured that tunnelling companies numbers 170 to 177 were ready for deployment in mid-February 1915.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 49. In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the BEF was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 165. To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer. These companies each comprised 5 officers and 269 sappers; they were aided by additional infantrymen who were temporarily attached to the tunnellers as required, which almost doubled their numbers. The success of the first tunnelling companies formed under Norton-Griffiths' command led to mining being made a separate branch of the Engineer-in-Chief's office under Major-General S.R. Rice, and the appointment of an 'Inspector of Mines' at the GHQ Saint-Omer office of the Engineer-in-Chief. A second group of tunnelling companies were formed from Welsh miners from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who were attached to the 1st Northumberland Field Company of the Royal Engineers, which was a Territorial unit. The formation of twelve new tunnelling companies, between July and October 1915, helped to bring more men into action in other parts of the Western Front. Most tunnelling companies were formed under Norton-Griffiths' leadership during 1915, and one more was added in 1916. On 10 September 1915, the British government sent an appeal to Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to raise tunnelling companies in the Dominions of the British Empire. On 17 September, New Zealand became the first Dominion to agree the formation of a tunnelling unit. The New Zealand Tunnelling Company arrived at Plymouth on 3 February 1916 and was deployed to the Western Front in northern France.Anthony Byledbal, \\"New Zealand Tunnelling Company: Chronology\\" (online ), access date 5 July 2015 A Canadian unit was formed from men on the battlefield, plus two other companies trained in Canada and then shipped to France. Three Australian tunnelling companies were formed by March 1916, resulting in 30 tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers being available by the summer of 1916. Unit history 172nd Tunnelling Company included a significant number of miners from South Wales, as did the 184th, 170th, 171st, 253rd and 254th Tunnelling Company.Ritchie Wood, Miners at War 1914-1919: South Wales Miners in the Tunneling Companies on the Western Front, Wolverhampton Military Studies, Solihull (Helion and Company) 2016, . From its formation in April 1915 until the end of the war the company served under First Army south of the Ypres Salient.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 19. Ypres Salient Following its formation, 172nd Tunnelling Company was first employed in the area of St Eloi and The Bluff at Ypres, added to which the 172nd Tunnelling Company was also active at Hill 60. The Germans held the top of Hill 60 from 16 December 1914 to 17 April 1915, when it was captured briefly by the British 5th Division after the explosion of five mines under the German lines by the Royal Engineers. The early underground war in the area had involved both the 171st and 172nd Tunnelling Company. In July 1915, 175th Tunnelling Company was extended to Hill 60, and 172nd Tunnelling Company focused on The Bluff instead. Captain William Henry Johnston VC, who commanded 172nd Tunnelling Company in early 1915 An aerial view of St Eloi, photographed on 1 April 1916. The craters created by the D2, D1, H4 and H1 mines are clearly visible. The Bluff, located halfway in between Voormezele and Hollebeke, is an artificial ridge in the landscape created by spoil from failed attempts to dig a canal. With the additional height in an otherwise relatively flat landscape, The Bluff was an important military objective. German forces took The Bluff in February 1916. In addition to The Bluff, 172nd Tunnelling Company was also responsible for mining at St Eloi south of Ypres. At St Eloi, military mining began in early 1915. The Germans had built an extensive system of defensive tunnels and were actively mining at the intermediate levels. In March 1915, they fired mines under the elevated area known as The Mound just south-east of St Eloi and in the ensuing fighting (the Action of St Eloi, 14‚Äì15 March 1915) the British infantry suffered some 500 casualties. A month later, on 14 April 1915, the Germans fired another mine producing a crater over in diameter. After these experiences, the British started an extensive programme of defensive mining at St Eloi to protect the British trenches from future German mines, but also included offensive elements by placing large attack mines beneath the German trenches. Much of this work was done by the 177th Tunnelling Company and the 172nd Tunnelling Company, the latter commanded in early 1915 by Captain William Henry Johnston VC. Johnston left 172nd Tunnelling Company in early May, when he was succeeded as officer commanding by William Clay Hepburn, a Territorial Army Captain in the Monmouthshire Regiment. Hepburn was a mining engineer and colliery agent in civilian life, and the first non-regular Royal Engineer officer to command a Tunnelling Company. The officer in charge of 172nd Tunnelling Company's offensive mining activities at St Eloi was Lieutenant Horace Hickling, who would go on to command 183rd Tunnelling Company on the Somme in 1916, supported by Lieutenant Frederick Mulqueen, who would go on to command 182nd Tunnelling Company at Vimy in 1917. The geology of the Ypres Salient featured a characteristic layer of sandy clay, which put very heavy pressures of water and wet sand on the underground works and made deep mining extremely difficult. In autumn of 1915, 172nd Tunnelling Company managed to sink shafts through the sandy clay at a depth of down to dry blue clay at a depth of , which was ideal for tunneling, from where they continued to drive galleries towards the German lines at a depth of . This constituted a major achievement in mining technique and gave the Royal Engineers a significant advantage over their German counterparts. Meanwhile, at The Bluff, mining was continued by the 172nd Tunnelling Company and in November 1915, John Norton-Griffiths proposed to sink 20 or 30 shafts, about apart, into the blue clay from St Eloi to The Bluff. On 21 January 1916, German miners blew several large charges at The Bluff, which caused 172nd Tunnelling Company to halt its work on the shallow galleries in St Eloi in order to complete the deep mines as soon as possible. On 14 February, the German infantry succeeded in capturing The Bluff from the British and advanced towards St Eloi, raising fears that the British deep mines might be captured before they could be fired. The British decided to use the deep mines created by 172nd Tunnelling Company at St Eloi in a local operation (the Battle of St Eloi Craters, 27 March ‚Äì 16 April 1916) and six charges were prepared. There were four central mines, of which two were laid from shaft D and two from shaft H. The largest, code-named D1, contained of ammonal and was placed beneath The Mound, while the mines code-named D2, H1 and H4 were charged with between and . The two flanking mines, code-named I and F, were significantly smaller charges laid short of the German front line. For most of the time, the British preparations were severely obstructed by highly efficient German counter-mining. When the mines were fired at 4.15 a.m. on 27 March 1916, D1 and D2 were detonated first, followed by H1 and H4, then I and finally F. To witnesses it \\"appeared as if a long village was being lifted through flames into the air\\" and \\"there was an earth shake but no roar of explosion\\". The detonation obliterated The Mound and killed or buried some 300 men of the 18th Reserve J√§ger Battalion; two miles away, at Hill 60, the trenches rocked and heaved. The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers attacked and held the D1, D2 and F craters, but efforts to dig communications trenches to their positions failed under the heavy German fire, the muddy ground and debris thrown up by the explosions. British attempts to gain a line beyond the craters were unsuccessful for a week but eventually took the four central craters in the early morning of 3 April, shortly before the 3rd Division was relieved by the 2nd Canadian Division. A German counter-attack during the night of 5 April captured the craters, and the Canadians were ordered to withdraw. The operation had been a failure and the advantage of the mines had been lost; the problem lay in the problem of integrating mines into the attack and the Allied inability to hold crater positions after they had been captured. It also demonstrated that holding a crater against concentrated fire and determined German counterattack was extremely difficult. In March 1916, 172nd Tunnelling Company handed its work at St Eloi over to 1st Canadian Tunnelling Company. It then relieved 181st Tunnelling Company in the Rue du Bois area, but soon moved back to The Bluff. Vimy sector British-dug fighting tunnel in Vimy sector In April 1916, the 172nd Tunnelling Company was relieved at The Bluff by 2nd Canadian Tunnelling Company and moved to Neuville-Saint-Vaast near Vimy in northern France, where it was deployed alongside 176th Tunnelling Company, which had moved to Neuville-Saint-Vaast in April 1916 and remained there for a considerable time. The front sectors at Vimy and Arras, where extremely heavy fighting between the French and the Germans had taken place during 1915, were taken over by the British in March 1916. Vimy, in particular, was an area of busy underground activity. From spring 1916, the British had deployed five tunnelling companies along the Vimy Ridge, and during the first two months of their tenure in the area, 70 mines were fired, mostly by the Germans. Between October 1915 and April 1917 an estimated 150 French, British and German charges were fired in this sector of the Western Front. Neuville-Saint-Vaast was close to the German \\"Labyrinth\\" stronghold between Arras and Vimy and not far from Notre Dame de Lorette. British tunnellers progressively took over work on the shafts in the area from the French between February and May 1916.The Durand Group: Vimy Ridge online, access date 2016-08-03 As part of this process, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company took over a sector between Roclincourt and √âcurie from the French 7/1 compagnie d'ing√©nieurs territoriaux during March 1916. On 29 March 1916, the New Zealanders exchanged position with the 185th Tunnelling Company and moved to Roclincourt-Chantecler, a kilometre south of their old sector. 172nd Tunnelling Company seems to have shared the Neuville-Saint-Vaast sector with the 176th and 185th Tunnelling Company until it was relieved there in May 1916 by the 2nd Australian Tunnelling Company. Also in May 1916, a German infantry attack, which forced the British back , was aimed at neutralising British mining activity by capturing the shaft entrances. From June 1916, however, the Germans withdrew many miners to work on the Hindenburg Line and also for work in coal mines in Germany. In the second half of 1916 the British constructed strong defensive underground positions, and from August 1916, the Royal Engineers developed a mining scheme to support a large-scale infantry attack on the Vimy Ridge proposed for autumn 1916, although this was subsequently postponed. After September 1916, when the Royal Engineers had completed their network of defensive galleries along most of the front line, offensive mining largely ceased although activities continued until 1917. The British gallery network beneath Vimy Ridge eventually grew to a length of . 172nd Tunnelling Company stayed near Vimy and remained active in the area in preparation for the Battle of Vimy Ridge (9‚Äì12 April 1917), together with 175th and 182nd Tunnelling Companies. 184th Tunnelling Company and 255th Tunnelling Company also served a tenure at Vimy. The Canadian Corps was posted to the northern part of Vimy Ridge in October 1916 and preparations for an attack were revived in February 1917. Prior to the Battle of Vimy Ridge, the British tunnelling companies secretly laid a series of explosive charges under German positions in an effort to destroy surface fortifications before the assault.Boire (1992) pp. 22‚Äì23 The original plan had called for 17 mines and 9 Wombat charges to support the infantry attack, of which 13 (possibly 14) mines and 8 Wombat charges were eventually laid. At the same time, 19 crater groups existed along this section of the Western Front, each with several large craters.Boire (1992) p. 20 In order to assess the consequences of infantry having to advance across cratered ground after a mining attack, officers from the Canadian Corps visited La Boisselle and Fricourt where the mines on the first day of the Somme had been blown. Their reports and the experience of the Canadians at St Eloi in April 1916 ‚Äì where mines had so altered and damaged the landscape as to render occupation of the mine craters by the infantry all but impossible ‚Äì, led to the decision to remove offensive mining from the central sector allocated to the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge. Further British mines in the area were vetoed following the blowing by the Germans on 23 March 1917 of nine craters along no man's land as it was probable that the Germans were aiming to restrict an Allied attack to predictable points. The three mines already laid by 172nd Tunnelling Company were also dropped from the British plans. They were left in place after the assault and were only removed in the 1990s. Another mine, prepared by 176th Tunnelling Company against the German strongpoint known as the Pimple, was not completed in time for the attack. The gallery had been pushed silently through the clay, avoiding the sandy and chalky layers of the Vimy Ridge, but by 9 April 1917 was still short of its target. In the end, two mines were blown before the attack, while three mines and two Wombat charges were fired to support the attack, including those forming a northern flank. In early 1918 half of 252nd Tunnelling Company, arriving in the Vimy Ridge sector from Beaumont-Hamel, was attached to 172nd Tunnelling Company. Somme sector March 1918 saw 172nd Tunnelling Company working on a new defensive line on the Somme, near Bray-Saint-Christophe. It fought as emergency infantry near Villecholles, where it carried out a fighting retreat. Amiens 1918 In April 1918, troops of 172nd Tunnelling Company fought a large fire in Amiens. Memorial On a small square in the centre of Sint-Elooi stands the 'Monument to the St Eloi Tunnellers' which was unveiled on 11 November 2001.

Johnston had won the Victoria Cross on 14 September 1914 during the Race to the Sea at Missy in France. He was killed in the Ypres Salient on 8 June 1915. * William Hackett enlisted in the British Army on 25 October 1915, after having been rejected three times by the York and Lancaster Regiment for being too old and having been diagnosed with a heart condition. He spent two weeks of basic training at Chatham, joining 172nd Tunnelling Company. He later served with 254th Tunnelling Company. He was 43 years old and a Sapper when he performed a deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross on 22 June/23 June 1916 at Shaftesbury Avenue Mine, near Givenchy-l√®s- la-Bass√©e, France.

History The current building replaced an ancient chapel. The church was built to the designs of the architect Thomas Gardner for the residents of Richard Arkwright‚Äôs mill in Cromford. Construction was completed during 1792-97. After Sir Richard Arkwright death (1792), he was buried at the church in Matlock, Derbyshire, but in 1797, his remains were moved to St. Mary‚Äôs; many others of the family were subsequently buried here. The church comprises a nave with chancel, west tower and west narthex. It was remodelled in 1858 by Henry Isaac Stevens. The church's website provides these details: > The original Georgian church apparently consisted of a large rectangular > open-plan nave and Sanctuary with the altar at the east end. In the mid-19th > century the church was completely redesigned and extensively ‚ÄúGothicised‚Äù in > 1858‚Äì59 by Henry Isaac Stephens.

Post-war some machines were modified to carry passengers. Design and development Caudron C.23 The C.23 BN.2 was designed to be a night bomber able to reach Berlin with a bomb load. The French BN.2 military category indicated a two-seat night bomber but the C.23 had a crew of three. It had much in common with the Caudron C.22 but was almost 50% larger in span, requiring an extra bay and more powerful engines. It was a large five bay biplane, with fabric covered, constant chord, unswept wings with angled tips. The upper wing, which carried the ailerons, had a slightly greater (4%) span and a smaller chord. There was no stagger, so the sets of parallel interplane struts were vertical; flying wires braced each bay. Pairs of V-form engine bearing struts, which supported the two neatly cowled Salmson 9Z nine cylinder water-cooled radial engines just above the lower wing, defined the inner two bays. The C.23 had a flat sided fuselage. There was a gunner's position in the nose, equipped with twin Lewis guns. A roomy open cockpit was positioned under the wing leading edge, with a separate gunner's cockpit behind it under a large, rounded trailing edge cut-out. This was fitted with another pair of Lewis guns and a further gun firing downwards through a trapdoor in the floor. A low, broad fin carried a broad balanced rudder which extended down to the keel. The tailplane, angular in plan and of very low aspect ratio, was mounted on top of the fuselage and its elevators had cut- outs for rudder movement. The bomber had a fixed tailskid undercarriage, with mainwheels in pairs, their axles mounted on longitudinal bars attached to the wing, under the engines, by N-form struts. The Caudron C.23 first flew in February 1918, piloted by Jules V√©drines. Higher power engines, the Salmson 18Z or the Hispano-Suiza 8Fb, were considered in April 1918 but the Salmson was not yet fully developed and trials with the Hispano led nowhere. Operational history By the time of the Armistice in November 1918 fifty- four C.23s had been delivered to the French Air Force. Some served with the 22nd squadron until their replacement by the more powerful Farman Goliath in February 1920. Very soon after the war some C.23s were modified to carry twelve passengers in an open cockpit formed by an opening between the cockpit and mid-upper gunner's position. On 10 February 1919 one made the first passenger flight between Paris and Brussels, carrying five passengers tightly packed together. One C.23, designated C.23 bis, was modified to carry fifteen passengers internally. V√©drines and his engineer Guillian were killed in a C.23 when an engine failed whilst trying to establish a route from Paris to Rome.

The construction began in 1690 for a new French fort on the island of Newfoundland. In 1662, the French had established a strategic trading post in a well protected cove overlooking Placentia Bay that separates Avalon to the rest of the island of Newfoundland and near the Grand Banks. To protect this place, several forts were built around the cove, Fort Plaisance from 1662, the Fort Royal in 1687 and Saint Louis 1690. Fort Saint Louis was built inside the harbor in order to protect the small port city of Plaisance from an enemy attack. It was to reinforce the old fort built of wood in Placentia. Fort Saint Louis was built in stone. Its enclosure was nearly 250 meters long, encircling two bastions, the headquarters of the governor and the buildings of the garrison. The walls stood four meters high and the walls measured two meters thick. Almost thirty guns were operational on this fort. The fort was attacked during King William's War in the Battle of Placentia (1692). In 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht forced the French to abandon their settlements in Newfoundland. 'Plaisance' become 'Placentia'. The inhabitants were moved to √éle Royale which began the construction of Louisbourg.

In the solid state, the compound features platinum(IV) in octahedral coordination geometry. Preparation The compound was first reported by Henri Moissan by the fluorination of platinum metal in the presence of hydrogen fluoride. A modern synthesis involves thermal decomposition of platinum hexafluoride. Properties Platinum tetrafluoride vapour at 298.15 K consists of individual molecules. The enthalpy of sublimation is 210 kJmol‚àí1. Original analysis of powdered PtF4 suggested a tetrahedral molecular geometry, but later analysis by several methods identified it as octahedral, with four of the six fluorines on each platinum bridging to adjacent platinum centres. Reactions A solution of platinum tetrafluoride in water is coloured reddish brown, but it rapidly decomposes, releasing heat and forming an orange coloured platinum dioxide hydrate precipitate and fluoroplatinic acid. When heated to a red hot temperature platinum tetrafluoride decomposes to platinum metal and fluorine gas. When heated in contact with glass, silicon tetrafluoride gas is produced along with the metal. Platinum tetrafluoride can form adducts with selenium tetrafluoride and bromine trifluoride. Volatile crystalline adducts are also formed in combination with BF3, PF3, BCl3, and PCl3. Related compounds The fluoroplatinates are salts containing the PtF62‚àí ion. Fluoroplatinic acid H2PtF6 forms yellow crystals, that absorb water from the air. Ammonium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and rare earth including lanthanum fluoropalatinate salts are soluble in water. Potassium, rubidium, caesium, and barium salts are insoluble in water.

Present that day were: David Jones C. C. Fahnestock, the regiment's quartermaster and fife-major; F. M. Guss and Leonard R. Thomas, captains of Companies A and C; sergeant Isaac A. Cleaver and privates Oliver B. Channell, Samuel A. March and John J. Still (Company C); sergeant George L. Smith (Company E); brevet-lieutenant-colonel Dewitt Clinton Lewis (Company F); private Evan Pharaoh (Company F); former corporal Barnett R. Rapp (Company K). Following further planning sessions, during which the organization's name was established as \\"The Society of the Ninety-Seventh Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers\\", and annual dues were set at $.50 plus a one-time entrance fee of $1.00 per person, the regiment's first annual reunion was held on October 29 of that same year at Camp Wayne in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The stated purpose of the gatherings was to promote \\"kindly feeling, the revival of old associations, and the collection and preservation of records of the services rendered by this Regiment during the 'War of the Rebellion'\\". After assembling at the Fair Grounds at 11 a.m., roughly 200 surviving members of the regiment marched behind their old regimental bandsmen. They then engaged in a business meeting from 11 a.m. to noon, during which the surviving members discussed explored ways to memorialize their service to the nation, including publishing a regimental history and erecting a battlefield monument, and listened to the day's keynote speakers who recallled key moments in the 97th Pennsylvania's history before enjoying a dinner of roast beef, lamb and turkey with rolls and butter, chicken salad, oysters on the shell, chowchow, cranberry sauce, an assortment of fruit, followed by ice cream and cake with coffee and a series of toasts. The event ended at 4 p.m. with a march by the veterans to fife and drum music from Church to High to Market to Gay streets.Price, Isaiah.

Early life and career  Daniel Genis was born in New York City to Alexander and Irina Genis only a few months after their emigration from the Soviet Union, in 1977. He grew up in Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY. His father, Alexander Genis is a Russian writer, broadcaster, and cultural critic, and Genis's parents' apartment during the 80s and 90s doubled as a clubhouse for Russian writers and artists. Genis was exposed to literature and the arts from a young age, mixing with artists and intellectuals, including Russian ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, Umberto Eco, Norman Mailer, Joseph Brodsky, and Czech film director Milos Forman. The living room of his childhood home was where Daniel's father and his collaborators edited –°–µ–º—å –¥–Ω–µ–π (Seven Days) (a weekly literary supplement to –ù–æ–≤–æ–µ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–µ –°–ª–æ–≤–æ) for a short time, but they achieved almost star status as the chief literary critics of the weekly newspaper –ù–æ–≤—ã–π –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∞–Ω–µ—Ü. Alexander Genis, Peter Vail, Sergei Dovlatov and Vagrich Bakhchanyan collaborated on a weekly emigre magazine which was later considered a hallmark of the early 80s because of its early publications of Eduard Limonov, Vladimir Sorokin, Victor Pelevin and Andrei Sinyavsky. Genis graduated from Stuyvesant High School (where he was a student of Frank McCourt) in 1996, along with classmates such as Harry Siegel, Jessica Valenti, and Kelly Karbacz. He continued his education at New York University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in History and French in 1999. Genis also spent one year studying at the University of Copenhagen in 1999. Genis obtained an interest during this time in antiquarian bookshops and specifically, eighteenth and nineteenth century editions of Greek and Roman classic literature. While in college, Genis initially worked as an intern and then as editorial assistant at the publishing house Applause Books, from 1997 to 1998. His tasks entailed setting manuscripts into digital versions and, after two years, Genis ended with an editing credit on The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Film. Moreover, Genis worked in the production team for the publication of American theatre and film book editor John A. Willis's Theatre World in 1997. After graduating from NYU, Genis worked for Nancy Love as an agent-associate. This literary agency was on the Upper East Side; Genis's role entailed finding new authors to represent, although his literary interests did not match his employer's taste for self-help books. Genis and Nancy Love parted ways in 2001. Arrest and incarceration In 2001, Genis traded in his publishing career for a life of crime to feed a raging heroin appetite. His taste for the illegal substance (costing Genis $100 per day) led him to embark on a string of robberies in order to pay his debts. The month-long robbery spree centered around the Lower East Side, Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Gramercy Park, and the Financial District. Nicknamed the \\"apologetic bandit\\" by the press, Genis offered apologies to his victims as he took their cash and returned their wallets. His 18 robberies accounted for $700 in total. During one week in 2003, Genis committed five robberies. In November of the same year he was identified by one of his victims, arrested, and eventually convicted of five counts of armed robbery, for which he served 10 years in prison. While serving his sentence, Genis spent four years in close proximity to American mass murderer Ronald DeFeo. Genis had not only shared with DeFeo the horror of substance addiction, but both hailed from Amityville as well. Since his release, Genis wrote an article for Vice Magazine, commenting on their interactions \\"inside\\". Genis currently has a bi-weekly column at Vice, titled \\"In the Margins\\". Genis has also collaborated with fellow drug addict and convict Michael Alig. In a 2014 interview with Genis, after being released on parole, Alig said that his time spent reading while in solitary inspired him to write his memoirs, which he titled Aligula, and he particularly identified with the character Raskolnikov from Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. Genis's prison sentence granted him time to plan his literary career. In fact, Genis remarks that his authentic education as a reader and writer began not while he was a history major or working at a literary agency in Manhattan, but at the Green Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville, New York; where Genis read 1,046 books. Genis kept a diary of his readings, numbering and annotating each entry. While exploring books that helped make sense of his situation, he spent most of his attention on serious fiction and, in particular, long, difficult novels. Genis read for practical knowledge and for the sake of his own sanity, reading an assortment of books ranging from incarceration memoirs by Malcolm X to classic literature written by James Joyce, Marcel Proust, and Fyodor Dostoevsky and at his father's request, Ulysses. Additionally, Genis read In Search of Lost Time alongside two academic guidebooks full of French notations and a dictionary, stating that no other novel gave him as much appreciation for his time in prison. Genis continued work on his 300-page novel after spending $275 on a Swintec typewriter (with clear plastic cases allowing easy inspection for drugs, weapons, or other contraband, these typewriters are commonly found in prison). Genis's dystopian novel, titled Narcotica, is based on the acceptance of narcotics in Western culture. It offers an alternate version of society had illicit drugs, not alcohol, become the legally or socially accepted inebriant of choice. Additionally, Genis wrote thousands of letters and journal entries. The tri-lingual Genis was often given the task of translating from Russian to English, in exchange for commissary money. For instance, Genis was tasked to translate his father's work for the American publication Read Russia. Alongside his literary progression, Genis became an avid weightlifter. Since being released from prison, he has criticized the efforts of some US states to remove weights from prisons. He recently wrote about prison weightlifting and its benefits for Deadspin magazine. Additionally, Genis developed a taste for cooking and has since written on the topic of cooking in prison for the Daily Beast and the publication KCRW, discussing the variable cooking opportunities depending on the security levels of one's prison. Subsequent articles since his release, demonstrate Genis's interest in the influence of religion in prison, attributing the high numbers of religious inmates to a lack of education. Furthermore, he has reported extensively on the discriminatory nature of life in jail for Jewish inmates. Additionally, Genis has unpacked the realities of sexuality and masculinity for inmates with HuffPost Live's academic, journalist and author Marc Lamont Hill, American author and academic Mark Anthony Neal, and former inmate turned public speaker, author, and activist Shaun Attwood.  Post-prison works  After his release from prison, Genis was selected for representation by the Mary Evans literary agency. He sold his forthcoming memoirs, titled The Last Beat, to Penguin Books in the summer of 2014. The publication discusses the 1,046 books he read during his incarceration. His writings have appeared in Gothamist, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, The Daily Beast, Moscow Times, Vice, Paris Review, Washington Post, New York Daily News, Thrillist, Deadspin, The Fix, Testosterone Nation, Chicago Tribune, Minneapolis Star, and The Guardian online. Genis wrote an article for Vice entitled, \\"New York State's Scariest Prison\\", concerning the escapees at Clinton Correctional Facility in June 2015. Genis also appeared on NBC Universal's Deadline in June 2015 to discuss Clinton's escape, CNN's Newday (regarding Joyce Mitchell) and was quoted by The Buffalo News in its article \\"Escaping prison, surviving the wild: the journey of Matt and Sweat\\". His appearance on Burl Barer's Outlaw Radio show necessitated a second interview. Genis became a contributor to the museum/art work that is Joe Coleman's '\\"Odditorium by offering a seven-inch pony tail he grew over seven years of incarceration. It was inducted in a ceremony and placed on a shelf with Wild Bill Carlisle's Stetson hat. Genis published his fifth article in Newsweek in 2015, continuing to explore his interest in Chinese art. He profiled the gallery owner who is integral to the evolution in this art movement's reputation in \\"Eli Klein on Riding the Wave China's Contemporary Art Scene\\" for Klein Sun Gallery in Chelsea, New York. Previously, Genis has written extensively on the celebrated Chinese artist Zhang Dali. Genis's publication, entitled \\"A Gentleman's Guide to Sex in Prison\\", was listed in the \\"30 Great Articles and Essays about Sex\\" and has been viewed over 850,000 times. Genis reviewed the art opening Michael Alig had in three galleries in one night. Manager Kirsten Bowen and the Woolly Mammoth Theatre reference Genis's article in their show, Lights Rise on Grace. which explores themes of incarceration. Genis has written for numerous German, Russian, and Austrian newspapers, including The Moscow Times and S√ºddeutsche Zeitung. Translations of his work exist in French, Italian, Spanish and Hebrew. Genis has featured on multiple radio talk shows, such as National Public Radio, discussing subjects concerning weightlifting and masculinity in prison. Further talk show appearances include speaking with KCRW on topics concerning \\"Cooking in Prison\\", \\"Celebrating Thanksgiving: Stomach, Strategy, Leftovers and Lore\\", as well as for the Texas radio program Walter and Johnson, WBAL's Morning News, Talkline with Zev Brenner on the discussion of \\"Jews in Jail\\", and Friendly Atheist Podcasts talk show. In addition to his writing and appearances, Genis has delivered several lectures on his writing career. As a guest lecturer for Scott Anderson, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of British Columbia, he addressed a class of Philosophy graduate students who had been assigned Genis's work to read for an ethics course. Genis answered questions for two hours after speaking about life ethics. Genis's talk, titled \\"Why Terrorists Weep: The Socio-Cultural Practices of Jihadi Militant\\", brings attention to his writings on culture inside American prisons. In the summer of 2015, Genis had two magazine debuts. His viral article on cooking in prison, published by the Thrillist Media Group, was selected for inclusion in The Week. The article was also paraphrased in Esquire His feature on the unlikely winners of war with abstract opponents put Genis on the cover of Fr√§ulein Intersections Magazin Num√©ro Homme in Berlin. Genis was voted Employee of the Month by Vice Magazine in September 2014. He also received Rookie of the Year award by Deadspin and was nominated for Deadspin's Hall of Fame in 2014. With the help of Burl Barer and Daniel Simone, he is currently developing a project with the famed Serbian-American criminal authority Pavle Stanimiroviƒá.  Personal life  In June 2003, five months before his arrest, Genis married Petra Szabo, a photographer and instructor of VinyƒÅsa and Forrest yoga.www.petragenis.com Since Genis's release from prison, he and Szabo have lived in Brooklyn, New York.

She is best known for her one-woman performance of The Ramayana which is her husband, Gopal Sharman's contemporary dramatic interpretation of the Sanskrit epic. This Ramayana, subtitled 'the epic; as a play in English' is the only Indian production until today to have played on Broadway. Jalabala Vaidya, Gopal Sharman and their daughter Anasuya Vaidya, are the founders and directors of The Akshara Theatre ‚Äì non-profit arts institution in New Delhi, India.

No one with any interest in the arts, or even his or her own salvation, can afford to miss this play.‚Äù Now Jalabala opens and closes the play and the rest of it is performed by actors from the Akshara Theatre Repertory. Early life and career Jalabala was born in London, daughter of a half English-half Italian mother, Madge, a concert singer, and Indian journalist, author and freedom fighter, Suresh Vaidya. She began school at St.Paul's, London then at Queen Mary High School, Mumbai. She graduated from Miranda House, Delhi University with an English Honours Degree standing third in the University where she was also actively involved in theatre. Vaidya began her career as a journalist at Link Magazine in New Delhi which was where she first met Gopal, who, at the time, worked there as an arts critic. Vaidya's first international theatrical success came in Rome at the Teatro Goldoni where she performed Full Circle written by Gopal Sharman who was also present at the reading. The due soon embarked on a series of successful theatrical seasons on London‚Äôs West End, and performance tours all over Europe. The British MP and columnist for The Sunday Times, Tom Driberg, said of Jalabala: ‚ÄúShe performs exquisitely.‚Äù The critic of The Times, London was equally ecstatic and likened her to Isadora Duncan. Jalabala Vaidya also produces, performs in and narrates most of her husband‚Äôs highly acclaimed television films. To name some for which she is best known: India Alive, The Kashmir Story, The Sufi Way, Gitanjali and Gandhi‚Äôs Gita a play about Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs translation of the Bhagavad Gita into simple Gujarati and how he and his wife Kasturba went through the final revision in the Himalayan foothills. The Akshara Theatre, New Delhi Jalabala and her husband, Gopal Sharman, are co-founders of the Akshara National Classical Theatre in New Delhi, India. The Akshara is a non-profit society, an arts complex designed and built by Sharman, where she has played the lead role in more than 20 plays. Registered as a society in 1980 under the name The Akshara National Classical Theatre of India, the theatre‚Äôs endeavour is to present theatre, music and dance in its various spaces on a nightly basis for a ticket paying audience in an effort to create a sustainable artistic model. The Akshara works towards fostering interaction between the diverse cultures of India and the world through the performing arts. In addition to performances the Akshara runs the Diksha Programme of Training in Indian classicism, with year-long classes and workshops in the Indian performing arts for children and adults, as well as the popular, annual 5-week Diksha Summer Festival for children. Accolades The Akshara‚Äôs founders, Gopal Sharman and Jalabala Vaidya, have been recipients of various awards and honours such as the Sangeet natak Akademi‚Äôs Tagore Award, the Homi Bhabha Fellowship Award, the Delhi Natya Sangh Award, Andhra Pradesh Natya Akademi Honour, and the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Honour. They were also made Honorary Citizens of the City of Baltimore, in the United States, when they played there. Jalabala also received the Alumni Honors Award from Miranda House in 2006. Jalabala enjoys her time painting, writing poetry and scripts, spending time with her family- most of whom work at the Akshara- while acting and teaching highly specialized acting classes at the Akshara and is the author of three books: Be, a collection of short stories, and two collections of poetry, This is Full and That is Full.

The museum was founded in 2006 by David Bogle, a local businessman and registered member of the Cherokee Nation. The museum features artifacts from across the Americas covering over 14,000 years of history. The museum chooses to focus on the broader history of Native Americans as a whole, rather than any specific tribe and is laid out in roughly chronological order beginning around 12,000 BC and ending around 1900 AD. The museum offers free admission and welcomed 35,000 guests in 2016, with indications that attendance will continue to climb in the coming years. The museum is routinely listed as the second most popular attraction in Bentonville, following Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.  History  David Bogle began his personal collection by purchasing an arrow head collection from his childhood scoutmaster, and over time his personal collection grew exponentially. He began exploring opportunities to display his collection as well as to educate others in a deeper way about how Native Americans actually lived. That process resulted in the founding of the museum in 2006 in a converted house. The museum also includes items from the University of Arkansas museum that ceased operations in 2003. The museum relocated into its current space in 2008, and it has been expanded 3 times in the last decade to its current footprint of 13,500 square feet to accommodate the growing collection. The museum collection was further bolstered by an additional 1500 Meso- American items donated by Jim and Nancy Blair in 2015, adding new items from Southern Mexico, Central America and South America. Beginning in 2017, the museum has held an annual Cultural Symposium featuring concerts, workshops, speakers and film screenings.  Permanent Galleries   Paleo  This gallery focuses on the earliest time periods of humans in the Americas, from around 12,000 BC to 8,000 BC. Included as part of the collection is \\"Tusker\\", an authentic Woolly Mammoth skeleton which greets visitors upon their arrival.  Archaic  This gallery focuses on the shift toward the time of \\"Hunters and Gatherers\\" once the Mega-Fauna had perished and people began living in small semi-permanent villages and gathering food for themselves. This gallery has many examples of Archaic period tools and weapons, including Atl-atl specimens.  Woodlands  Covering the time from 1,000 BC to 900 AD, The Woodlands period is unique due to the development of crop cultivation and larger social structures, as well as the development of earthen burial and ceremonial mounds.  Mississippian  The Mississippian Period (lasting from 900 AD to 1450 AD) saw the development of larger villages and population centers. This period's prosperity led to some of the most intricate of all pottery samples that have survived to this day. This gallery includes the Sweetwater Biface, which is considered to be the thinnest flint artifact yet found.  Historic  The Historic period (lasting from 1650 AD to 1900 AD) includes the first contact and interactions of Native Americans with Europeans and continues until near present day.  Pre-Columbian  The Pre-Columbian Gallery shifts a wider focus to artifacts from Mexico, Central America, and South America before the time of Columbus. Specific cultures represented are the Aztec, Maya, and Inca peoples.  Programs   Creative Visions  Creative Visions is an interactive art-making workshop created by the Museum of Native American History in Bentonville, AR. The goal is to provide an opportunity for Native American art to be taught to people of all ages and heritages. Through a group art workshop with step-by-step instructions from an experienced Native American artist, culture will not only be preserved, but spread. It will also create personal advancements for the artist and participants. #EducateNotSeparate.  Native Conversations  Native Conversations is a lecture style event held by scholars, artists, and advocates that hosts monthly events about ways to give voice to historical and contemporary Native American culture.  Storytime  On the second Saturday of every month, fun Native stories and compatible activities that are geared towards children ages 4 and older are shared with the public. Kids of all ages and adults are welcome.

Known for contributing these images to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, Amos is working on The Vanamo Online Game Museum, a free digital archive of video game hardware. As of 2018, Amos resides in Brooklyn, New York City. Work The first picture of a gaming console Amos took for Wikipedia was the above picture of the Wii. Being \\"annoyed\\" at the poor quality of images of video game consoles on Wikipedia, Amos decided to document these systems before they were \\"forgotten in time.\\" Starting in 2010 with Nintendo's Wii console, which he happened to own, Amos soon \\"felt addicted\\" and started a list of every console he could think of. After putting up an ad on Craigslist, Amos came into contact with a collector in Huntington, Long Island, where he was able to photograph a collection of various consoles starting with those from Sega and Atari. He has expressed \\"surprise\\" at the increasing popularity of his freely licensed photos among print, television, Internet, and other media ‚Äì though he is still rarely credited for them. After purchasing and photographing video game consoles, Amos donates them to the New York University Game Center and the National Museum of Play, where he is allowed to access them at any time if he needs to re-shoot them. Amos has also taken and added pictures of fast food items and candy onto Wikipedia, noting that he is a \\"horrible eater\\". Projects In 2013, Amos raised through a Kickstarter campaign to purchase more hardware. His goal is to build the Vanamo Online Game Museum, an online archive of video game hardware in order to preserve the history of video games. In addition to photographs, the Vanamo Online Game Museum is intended to include an extensive history of each console and its development.

Signs and symptoms The size of the swelling is variable, but it is soft and can occur on one side or both sides. It is typically non tender, although sometimes there may be pain. It usually resolves over minutes to hours, however occasionally this may take days. The condition can be transient or recurrent. Causes The condition is caused by raised air pressure in the mouth. Diagnosis and management Pneumoparotitis is often misdiagnosed and incorrectly managed. The diagnosis is based mainly on the history. Crepitus may be elicited on palpation of the parotid swelling, and massaging the gland may give rise to frothy saliva or air bubbles from the parotid papilla. Further investigations are not typically required, however sialography, ultrasound and computed tomography may all show air in the parotid gland and duct. Management is simply by avoidance of the activity causing raised intraoral pressure which is triggering this rare condition. Prognosis Recurrent pneumoparotitis may predispose to sialectasis, recurrent parotitis, and subcutaneous emphysema of the face and neck, and mediastinum, and potentially pneumothorax. Epidemiology The condition is rare. It is more likely to occur in persons who regularly have raised pressure in the mouth, for example wind instrument players, and balloon and glass-blowers. Cases have also been reported with bicycle tyre inflation, whistling, nose blowing, cough and valsalva manoeuvre to clear the ears. It can be an iatrogenic effect of dental treatment, spirometry, and positive pressure ventilation. Apart from these factors, the condition mainly occurs in adolescents, often self-inflicted due to psychological issues.

The five-turbine, 30 MW project was developed by Deepwater Wind. Construction began in 2015 and in late summer 2016 five Alstom Haliade 150-6-MW turbines were erected. Operations were launched in December 2016. It is the largest project using wind power in Rhode Island. Design and capacity Block Island Wind Farm is a project of Deepwater Wind located about southeast of Block Island, the first offshore wind farm in the United States. The 30 megawatt, five-turbine demonstration project is expected to produce more than 125,000 megawatt hours of electricity annually. Power is transmitted from the turbines to the electric grid along a transmission submarine power cable buried under the ocean floor, making landfall north of Scarborough Beach in Narragansett, Rhode Island. The structures were designed by Alstom Wind, standing . They can withstand a Category 3 storm. The system connects New Shoreham, Rhode Island to the grid for the first time and allows it to cease using diesel generators which have been replaced with power from the cable supplying the island. Gulf Island Fabrication was interested in building the foundations. Permits and funding The Block Island Wind Farm was conceived as a larger project extending into neighboring Massachusetts to build a $1.5-billion, 385-megawatt wind farm in federal waters. The 100-turbine project could provide 1.3 terawatt-hours (TW¬∑h) of electricity per year ‚Äì 15 percent of all electricity used in the state. In 2009, the State of Rhode Island designated Deepwater Wind to begin with pilot projects. In that year Deepwater signed an agreement with National Grid to sell the power from the wind farm off Block Island, at an initial price of 24.4¬¢/kW¬∑h, with a guaranteed 3.5% annual increase. The permitting process for the project has been highly controversial, with the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (RIPUC) initially rejecting the agreement price with National Grid as being excessive to Rhode Island's electricity rate payers. However, after the Rhode Island General Assembly and Governor Carcieri changed the state law concerning the \\"commercial reasonability\\" of contract pricing, the RIPUC voted to approve the key contract. After continuing controversy and appeals, the Rhode Island Supreme Court ruled in July 2011 to uphold the RIPUC decision. Opponents of the project raised issue about the contract pricing with the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in August 2012, but FERC in October of the same year issued a decision that they would not act on the complaint. A total of nine reviews and permits from state federal agencies were acquired, the last in early May 2015. On May 11, 2015 a new complaint was filed with FERC alleging that the power purchase agreement with National Grid violates the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 and further alleging that the RIPUC violated the Federal Power Act and the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. However, Deepwater Wind maintains that there is no support for any of these claims and that FERC should promptly deny the new complaint in its entirety. While the wind turbines have been built in state waters southeast of Block Island, the transmission cable crosses federal waters in the Atlantic. A portion of the power is supplied directly to Block Island which is off shore from the Rhode Island mainland and had some of the highest power rates in the country due to its local generation by small diesel powered generators. Deepwater Wind announced March 2015 that it had received funding in the amount of $290 million from mandated lead arrangers Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale of Paris, France and KeyBank National Association of Cleveland, Ohio. The operation was verified in 2017. Construction In late 2014, Gulf Island Fabrication, Inc. began steel work construction at its Houma, Louisiana shipyard. The building phase would focus on the turbines' foundations (for platforms) to be pile-anchored to the ocean floor. On June 26, 2015, the first of the five foundations for the project began its move via barge from Louisiana. The turbines will be delivered later in 2015 and erected in place in 2016. Foundation assembly started in ProvPort in March 2016, with estimated commissioning in late 2016. GZA GeoEnvironmental provided the geotechnical design and consulting for the staging facility at the Port of Providence.http://www.gza.com/content/gza-geoenvironmental-inc-conducts- geotechnical-offshore-investigation-block-island-wind-farm The structures, designed by Alstom Wind, stand 600 ft (180 m) high and can withstand a Category 3 storm.[6][7][8] The foundations were designed by Louisiana-based Keystone Engineering Inc. to withstand a 1000-year storm. The foundations‚Äô robust strength is the product of meticulous design processes and thorough engineering analysis performed by Keystone. While the four-pile jacket foundation is common for offshore oil and gas platforms, Block Island's jackets are engineered to handle additional loading and vibration from the spinning turbines Keystone's engineering team ran thousands of test simulations, repeating each calculation multiple times to ensure the design would hold up under various weather conditions and load scenarios. Altogether, nearly 10 million tests were completed. On March 9, 2015, French company Alstom Group received final notication to begin fabrication of five Alstom Haliade 150 6 MW offshore wind turbines. GE Wind (offshore) acquired Haliade production in November 2015. As of July 2016, the site was grid-connected, and towers and LM Wind Power blades were in the port of Providence. The Norwegian installation jack-up vessel was on its way to France to pick up the 400 tonne generators, as it was not able to pick them up from an easier US port due to the Jones Act. A test version of the direct-drive turbine is installed at √òsterild Wind Turbine Test Field. √òsterild, 2017 The first turbine was erected in August 2016. On August 18, 2016, Deepwater Wind CEO Jeffrey Grybowski announced Block Island Wind Farm was fully constructed. The wind farm commenced commercial operation in December 2016. Operation During the March 2017 Winter Storm Stella, the turbines functioned as designed, automatically cutting out when the wind speed reached , and after the wind speed had topped out at about , they resumed production again once the speed went below the cut-off threshold. The project has also provided jobs for the state of Rhode Island, employing welders, workers during assembly of the wind turbines, and divers.

The MDP subsequently boycotted the parliamentary elections later in the year. However, Djoussouf was appointed Prime Minister in November 1998. Following a coup in 1999, the MDP left the FRN, as some member parties had supported the coup. Djoussouf was the MDP candidate again for the 2002 presidential elections, but finished fourth out of the nine candidates in the first round. Prior to the 2004 parliamentary elections the MDP joined the Camp of the Autonomous Islands alliance. The alliance won 12 of the 18 elected and all 15 of the indirectly- elected seats.

Boyd Eaton is a radiologist and one of the originators of the concept of Paleolithic nutrition. In 1985, he and Melvin Konner published a paper, Paleolithic Nutrition, in The New England Journal of Medicine which attracted some attention from other researchers. Life Eaton was born on March 18, 1938 in Old Town, Maine. He attended Duke University, graduating cum laude in 1960. He graduated cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1964. His residency and fellowship training took place at the Massachusetts General Hospital (1965‚Äì69). Career S. Boyd Eaton practiced diagnostic radiology for 41 years, specializing in musculoskeletal disorders. His patients often included members of the Atlanta Braves, the Atlanta Hawks, and the Atlanta Falcons. He worked in West Paces Ferry Hospital for most of his career. In 1988, Eaton, Konner and Marjorie Shostak expanded upon their previously proposed ‚Äúdiscordance hypothesis‚Äù in The Paleolithic Prescription (Harper & Rowe), the first book in what would become one of the bestselling health categories worldwide. This theory proposes that conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity and type 2 diabetes result in part from the mismatch between the lifestyle common in developed nations and that for which the human genome was originally selected (through natural selection) during the Stone Age. Loren Cordain writes, ‚ÄúThere is no doubt in my mind that without Dr. Eaton... Paleo would not have become a household term now recognized by millions‚Äù. Eaton was adjunct associate professor of anthropology at Emory University, and also clinical associate professor of radiology at Emory's School of Medicine. In 1966 he was medical director of the Olympic Village Polyclinic during the Centennial Olympic Games. He was featured in the 2012 documentary ‚ÄúThe Perfect Human Diet‚Äù.

Prior to the 20th century In the 1860s, Mrs. Nash, a transgender woman, served as Libby Custer's favorite laundress while at Fort Abraham Lincoln, south of Mandan, North Dakota. Late 20th century In the 1970s some businesses tolerated gay customers in Fargo, North Dakota and Grand Forks, North Dakota. A bar in Fargo, North Dakota had a \\"gay section\\" and local Chinese restaurant transformed into a popular disco at night. In the 1980s, the Fargo City Mayor, Jon Lindgren, caused some controversy when he publicly supported gay rights and supported the efforts of a local gay businessman to open up a gay bar, \\"My Place\\". The bar remained the only gay bar in North Dakota, until it closed down in 1989. In 1981, North Dakota Governor Governor Allen Olson signed Executive Order Number 10, which the Governor has recently said, in interviews with the Fargo Forum Newspaper, was an attempt to protect State workers from anti-gay discrimination in employment, without expressly mentioning sexual orientation. In 1981, the North Dakota Supreme Court, in the case of Jacobson v. Jacobson ruled that because of society's prejudices, the sexual orientation of a parent would be the deciding factor in child custody cases. This ruling was subsequently reversed in 2003 by the case of Damron v. Damron. In 1982, University of North Dakota students, faculty and staff formed the Ten Percent Society. A chapter of the organization was subsequently set up in Fargo, North Dakota. In June 1984, Fargo celebrated its first recognized gay pride week, with Mayor Jon Lindgren signing a degree formally recognizing the week‚Äôs gay pride celebrations. In 1996, North Dakota lawmakers pass a State edition, \\"Defense of Marriage Act\\". The law bans legal recognition of same-sex marriage in North Dakota, including those marriages performed in other States. In 1999, Equality North Dakota is formed to campaign for LGBT rights in North Dakota, especially the inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity in the State civil right code. The chairman of the organization was Robert Uebel. In 1999, a gay bar opened up in Moorhead, Minnesota, which is right across the river from Fargo, North Dakota. The bar attracts LGBT customers from all of North Dakota, as well as much of Western Minnesota. The bar closed down in 2011. Into the 21st century In 2002, due to a three-year grant from the Otto Bremer Foundation, North Dakota saw the formation of the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition (NDHRC). NDHRC is a broad-based coalition of individuals and organizations with interest in the furtherance of human rights in North Dakota. In November 2004, North Dakota voters ratified \\"Measure 1\\". The Constitutional Amendment banned legal recognition of same-sex marriage and similar options, including civil unions. Public opposition to the ballot measure came from Equality North Dakota, as well as by the Democratic Governor candidate Joe Satrom and the Libertarian Party of North Dakota. After 2004, Sherri and Vickie Paxon focused their energies in Bismarck. In late 2003 Dan Tokach and Ron Hildahl and their friends had started Dakota Good Friends to accomplish the Pride efforts, sponsor dances, and other social events. Dakota Outright emerged from Dakota Good Friends with Sherri and Vickie playing leading roles in Dakota OutRight, Q-Talk, LGBT support sessions, and Bismarck Pride. They also began doing LGBTQ cultural competency education in public health, churches, school conferences, universities, and other venues throughout the state. There were later legislative efforts, as well. Brad Perkins tried to reach out to HIV+ people through a support group, Caring Community Contacts. In April 2009, the North Dakota legislature failed to pass a bill (Senate Bill 2278) that would have protected LGBT people from discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations. The bill had passed in the State Senate, but did not have enough votes to pass in the State House. In September 2012, the North Dakota State College of Science football program dismissed Jamie Kuntz from the team after news broke that he was gay. The coach and the college insist that the decision was not motivated by Kuntz's sexual orientation, but because he had initially lied about it to his coach and had been seeing kissing his boyfriend. In November 2012, Joshua Boschee was elected to the North Dakota State legislature, representing District 44. He is the first openly gay person to win a legislative seat in North Dakota, possibly the first openly gay person to hold any partisan, elected public office. Boschee later unsuccessfully ran for the North Dakota Secretary of State, thus being the first openly gay candidate for a statewide office. In February 2013, the North Dakota legislature failed to pass a bill (Senate Bill 2252) that would have protected LGBT people from discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations. The bill had failed in the State Senate. In April 2015, the North Dakota legislature failed to pass a bill (Senate Bill 2279) that would have protected LGBT people from discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations. The bill had passed in the State Senate, and failed in the State House. In April 2015, State Rep. Randy Boehning, a Republican legislator from Fargo, comes out as gay. In August 2015, the bishop of the Catholic Church's Bismarck Diocese ordered all of its parishes and schools that sponsor Boy Scout troops to cut ties with the organization because of the organization decided to lift a ban on allowing openly gay adults to serve in leadership positions. An anti- discrimination resolution discouraging biased employment, rental/housing and service practices based on sexual orientation or gender identity was approved October 25, 2016 by the Bismarck City Commission. North Dakota‚Äôs Republican- led Senate rejected a measure (Senate Bill 2043 ) in January 2017 that would have changed state law to reflect the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs decision that same- sex couples have the right to marry. In February 2017, the North Dakota legislature failed to pass a bill (House Bill 1386 ) that would have protected LGBT people from discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations. A federal judge ordered in March 2018 a drilling rig service company working in North Dakota's Oil Patch to pay a former worker as part of an agreement to settle a lawsuit alleging harassment because he is gay. When filed in December 2016, it was the first case in North Dakota alleging an employer in the state had allowed an employee to suffer sexual harassment because of his sexual orientation. The judge's order for a settlement came a year later in December 2017. North Dakota Human Rights Coalition and Dakota Outright held an LGBTQ+ Summit in October 2018 in Mandan. The summit was a historical moment as it was the first statewide gathering for members of the LGBTQ+ community. The summit's goals were to provide opportunities for networking, support, and strategizing for educational opportunities and assist attendees and facilitators from across the county in recognizing their political power. The North Dakota Human Rights Coalition and Dakota Outright, an organization dedicated to serving the LGBTQIA community of the state's central and western parts, facilitated the summit. In January 2019, The North Dakota Senate defeated legislation banning discrimination based on sexual orientation, again turning down efforts to add LGBT protections to state law. Senate Bill 2303 (Senate Bill 2303 ) failed in a 20-27 vote. In April 2020, delegates to the North Dakota Republican Party approved the party platform by a mail-in vote of 621‚Äì139. Those who voted included Governor Doug Burgum, United States Senators John Hoeven, Senator and Kevin Cramer, and United States House Representative Kelly Armstrong. The resolution ‚Äì which refers to LGBTQ-inclusive civil rights legislation as \\"SOGI bills,\\" an expression common on far-right websites ‚Äì lists reasons why LGBTQ protections would hurt straight and cisgender people. Several months later, when the media drew attention to Resolution 31, the text no longer appeared on the party's website. Many Republican delegates condemned the platform. Republican Gov. Burgum also opposed the anti-gay platform, calling it \\"divisive and divisional\\", and saying, \\"As I've long said, all North Dakotans deserve to be treated equally and live free of discrimination\\". North Dakota Republican Party Chairman Rick Berg said that the resolution is intended to protect ‚Äúan individual‚Äôs religious liberty‚Äù and was referring to the state GOP‚Äôs belief that religious people have a right to discriminate against LGBTQ people. The chair of the resolutions committee would not say who had written it. Carrie Evans was elected to the Minot city council in June 2020. Carrie is the first openly gay woman to hold elected office in the State . In September 2020, Magic City Equality temporarily flew the rainbow flag of the LGBTQ community beneath the U.S. flag in front of Minot City Hall. Mayor Shaun Sipma, who approved the flag-raising, had signed a proclamation declaring June as Pride Month. The decision resulted in a heated exchange during a council meeting. The following day, The Minot Daily News took a public stand with Mayor Sipma and council member Carrie Evans on the flag issue. The debate over the flag- raising that focused on Minot‚Äôs LGBTQ2+ community entered a second round at September 21st‚Äôs Minot City Council meeting. The council voted to put any future flag raisings on hold until a policy is developed. Laws against homosexuality The first criminal law against sodomy in North Dakota was enacted in 1862, then the Dakota Territory. It prohibited heterosexual and homosexual fellatio. The law was expanded in 1885 to include anal intercourse and fellatio.The History of Sodomy Laws in the United States - North Dakota The state's vagrancy laws were expanded in 1903 to cover anyone whose speech or conduct was deemed to be \\"lewd, wanton and lascivious\\". In State v. Nelson (1917), the North Dakota Supreme Court broadened the scope of the sodomy law to include acts of cunnilingus. In 1927 the law initially designed to permit the sterilization of mentally and physically disabled inmates was expanded to include anyone who the State authorities believed might be \\"habitual criminals, moral degenerates and sexual perverts\\". The forced sterilization law was repealed in 1965. In 1973, the State legalized private, adult, consensual homosexual relations as part of a larger revision of the criminal code that set the universal age of consent at eighteen years.William N.

The tunnelling units were occupied in offensive and defensive mining involving the placing and maintaining of mines under enemy lines, as well as other underground work such as the construction of deep dugouts for troop accommodation, the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches and underground chambers for signals and medical services.The Tunnelling Companies RE , access date 25 April 2015 Background By January 1915 it had become evident to the BEF at the Western Front that the Germans were mining to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter- tactics or underground listening devices before the war, field marshals French and Kitchener agreed to investigate the suitability of forming British mining units. Following consultations between the Engineer-in-Chief of the BEF, Brigadier George Fowke, and the mining specialist John Norton-Griffiths, the War Office formally approved the tunnelling company scheme on 19 February 1915. Norton-Griffiths ensured that tunnelling companies numbers 170 to 177 were ready for deployment in mid-February 1915.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 49. In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the BEF was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 165. To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer. These companies each comprised 5 officers and 269 sappers; they were aided by additional infantrymen who were temporarily attached to the tunnellers as required, which almost doubled their numbers. The success of the first tunnelling companies formed under Norton-Griffiths' command led to mining being made a separate branch of the Engineer-in-Chief's office under Major-General S.R. Rice, and the appointment of an 'Inspector of Mines' at the GHQ Saint-Omer office of the Engineer-in-Chief. A second group of tunnelling companies were formed from Welsh miners from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who were attached to the 1st Northumberland Field Company of the Royal Engineers, which was a Territorial unit. The formation of twelve new tunnelling companies, between July and October 1915, helped to bring more men into action in other parts of the Western Front. Most tunnelling companies were formed under Norton-Griffiths' leadership during 1915, and one more was added in 1916. On 10 September 1915, the British government sent an appeal to Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to raise tunnelling companies in the Dominions of the British Empire. On 17 September, New Zealand became the first Dominion to agree the formation of a tunnelling unit. The New Zealand Tunnelling Company arrived at Plymouth on 3 February 1916 and was deployed to the Western Front in northern France.Anthony Byledbal, \\"New Zealand Tunnelling Company: Chronology\\" (online ), access date 5 July 2015 A Canadian unit was formed from men on the battlefield, plus two other companies trained in Canada and then shipped to France. Three Australian tunnelling companies were formed by March 1916, resulting in 30 tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers being available by the summer of 1916. Unit history Formation From its formation in March 1915 until the end of the war 174th Tunnelling Compa served under Third Army.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 20. It moved into the Houplines area in northern France, where it was in action in the Rue du Bois sector by early 1915. By autumn 1915, the 181st Tunnelling Company had also moved to this area.

In July 1915, 174th Tunnelling Company moved to the Somme, where it took over French mine workings between La Boisselle and Carnoy, some northeast of Amiens. On 24 July 1915, the unit established headquarters at Bray, taking over some 66 shafts at Carnoy, Fricourt, Maricourt and La Boisselle.http://www.lochnagarcrater.org, Military Mining (online), accessed 25 June 2015 Around La Boisselle, the Germans had dug defensive transversal tunnels at a depth of about 80 feet (24 metres), parallel to the front line. The British extended and deepened the tunnel system, first to and ultimately . Above ground the infantry occupied trenches were just apart.La Boisselle Study Group, History (online), accessed 25 June 2015 Early attempts at mining by the British on the Western Front had commenced in late 1914 in the soft clay and sandy soils of Flanders. Mining at La Boisselle was in chalk, much harder and requiring different techniques. The German advance had been halted at La Boisselle by French troops on 28 September 1914. There was bitter fighting for possession of the village cemetery, and for farm buildings on the south-western edge of the village, known as \\"L'√Ælot de La Boisselle\\" to the French, as \\"Granathof\\" (German: \\"shell farm\\") to the Germans and as \\"Glory Hole\\" to the British. In December 1914, French engineers began tunnelling beneath the ruins. With the war on the surface at stalemate, both sides continued to probe beneath the opponent's trenches and detonate ever-greater explosive charges. By August 1915, the French and Germans were working at a depth of ; the size of their charges had reached . 174th Tunnelling Company was supported in its role on the Somme by the 183rd Tunnelling Company, but the British did not have enough miners to take over the large number of French shafts and the French agreed to leave their engineers at work for several weeks. To provide the tunnellers needed, the British formed the 178th and 179th Tunnelling Companies in August 1915, followed by the 185th and 252nd Tunnelling Companies in October. The 181st Tunnelling Company was also present on the Somme. In October 1915, 174th Tunnelling Company was joined at La Boisselle by 179th Tunnelling Company, which had been formed in Third Army area that month. Later that month, 174th Tunnelling Company gave up part of that front sector to the newly-formed 183rd Tunnelling Company, and concentrated on the Mametz sector instead. As Allied preparations were under way for the Battle of the Somme (1 July ‚Äì 18 November 1916), the British tunnelling companies were to make two major contributions by placing 19 large and small mines beneath the German positions along the front line and by preparing a series of shallow Russian saps from the British front line into no man's land, which would be opened at zero hour and allow the infantry to attack the German positions from a comparatively short distance. In the front sector between Fricourt and Mametz, 174th Tunnelling Company planted the Mametz West group of four mines along the German trench lines running east from the heights of Bois Fran√ßais, located south of Hidden Wood and south-east of Fricourt. Local underground fighting at Bois Fran√ßais had already taken place in the winter of 1914 and spring of 1915. Before the summer of 1916, no-man's land south of Bois Fran√ßais had already witnessed the blowing of at least eight mines, and the area of Kiel and Danube trenches, located some to the east of Bois Fran√ßais, had also seen extensive underground operations. In October 1915, John Norton-Griffiths had even advocated the use of poison gas to deal with the German resistance in the Bois Fran√ßais sector, but the proposal was not followed up. As at Fricourt, no frontal assault was planned in this area for 1 July as the British infantry would have to advance across large crater fields. Instead, the Royal Engineers placed the Mametz West group of mines there ‚Äì three charges at Kiel Trench and one at Danube Trench. The first purpose of these mines was to protect the left of the 7th Division's attack south of Mametz, while the second was to protect the 20th Battalion, Manchester Regiment during their attack on the German lines. By October 1916, 174th Tunnelling Company had moved north of the river Ancre, facing Beaumont-Hamel. Arras, 1917 During the fighting at Bullecourt on 11 April, men of 174th Tunnelling Company, under the command of Major Hutchinson, MC, worked continuously for 30 hours to dig out the victims of a collapsed house. They rescued nine men of the 2/6th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment alive.Laurie Magnus, The West Riding Territorials in the Great War, London: Keegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1920//Uckfield: Naval & Military Press, 2004, , pp. 131‚Äì2. Spring Offensive 1918 In the German attack of March 1918, the unit suffered severe casualties while working on machine-gun emplacements at Bullecourt in northern France and fought as emergency infantry. Soon after, 174th Tunnelling Company worked on a long section of trench in northern France near Monchy-au-Bois.

She is portrayed by Ashley Johnson through performance capture. In the first game, the character Joel is tasked with escorting Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States in an attempt to create a cure for an infection to which Ellie is immune. While players briefly assume control of Ellie for a portion of the game, the artificial intelligence primarily controls her actions, often assisting in combat by attacking or identifying enemies. Ellie reappeared as the sole playable character in the downloadable content prequel, The Last of Us: Left Behind, in which she spends time with her friend Riley. Ellie is also the main character in the comic book prequel, The Last of Us: American Dreams, wherein she befriends Riley and has her first encounter with the rebel group the Fireflies. In The Last of Us Part II, the player controls a 19-year-old Ellie as she seeks revenge on those responsible for Joel's death. Ellie was created by Neil Druckmann, the creative director and writer of The Last of Us. Inspired by a mute character proposed for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Druckmann created her as a strong female character with a close relationship with Joel; throughout the first game's development, the relationship between Ellie and Joel was the central focus, with all other elements developed around it. Johnson inspired aspects of Ellie's personality, prompting Druckmann to make her more active in fighting hostile enemies. Following comparisons to actress Ellen Page, Naughty Dog redesigned her appearance to better reflect Johnson's personality and make her younger. For her performance in Part II, Johnson considered her own experiences with anxiety and researched the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder. The character has been well-received by critics, with Ellie's relationship with Joel most frequently the subject of praise. The strength and complexity of her character, and its subversion of the damsel in distress stereotype, have also been commended. Ellie's role in Left Behinds plot has prompted some social commentary within the industry, with coverage focusing on a scene depicting LGBT themes. Johnson's performance in Part II was praised for her depiction of vulnerability and suffering. Both the character and performance received numerous awards and nominations, and have regularly been placed favorably in polls and lists.  Creation  The concept for Ellie began with an unused idea for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (2009). Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley, directors of The Last of Us (2013), conceived a sequence with a mute female character who would accompany Uncharted protagonist Nathan Drake; Druckmann felt this would create a \\"beautiful\\" relationship through gameplay alone. An early alternative name for the character was Lily; Druckmann chose Ellie as he had considered the name for his daughter. Druckmann designed Ellie as a counterpart to Joel, the main playable character of The Last of Us. She was also intended to demonstrate that a character bond could be created entirely through gameplay. Druckmann described the game as a coming of age story for Ellie, in which she adopts the qualities of a survivor.  Casting  Ashley Johnson was cast as Ellie in The Last of Us shortly after her auditions; the development team felt that she fit the role, particularly when acting alongside Troy Baker, who portrayed Joel. Johnson made important contributions to Ellie's character development. She convinced Druckmann to give Ellie a more independent personality, and to make her more successful in combat. As Ellie, Johnson's performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology which produced approximately 85% of the game's animations. The remaining audio elements were recorded later in a studio. Johnson was sometimes uncomfortable while performing \\"disturbing\\" scenes. However, she was excited to play a rare example of a strong female video game character. For The Last of Us Part II (2020), Johnson considered her own experiences with anxiety, and researched the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with Druckmann.  Appearance  The team felt that establishing Ellie's appearance was critical. They determined that she needed to appear young enough to make her relationship with Joel‚Äîwho is in his 40s‚Äîbelievable, but old enough to be credible as a resourceful teenager capable of surviving. The team also considered Ellie important for marketing; Druckmann said that, when asked to move the image of Ellie from the front of the game's packaging to the back, \\"everyone at Naughty Dog just flat-out refused\\". Following the announcement of The Last of Us, comparisons were made between Ellie and actress Ellen Page. Page said that Naughty Dog had \\"ripped off\\" her likeness and that it was \\"not appreciated\\", as she was acting in another game, Beyond: Two Souls (2013). According to game director Bruce Straley, Naughty Dog had no knowledge of her involvement in Beyond, which was announced several months after The Last of Us. Kotaku observed that some players would likely confuse the characters. Straley said that, following the comparisons, Naughty Dog revised Ellie's appearance because \\"we want our characters to stand on their own two feet\\". Druckmann and Straley said the change better reflected Johnson's personality and make her younger. It was revealed in a trailer in May 2012. For Part II, Ellie's look underwent years of iteration; the team wanted a logical transition from the first game while maintaining a \\"practical yet personal\\" outfit. Lead character artist Ashley Swidowski designed Ellie's eyes to demonstrate a somberness not present in the first game, which used wider eyes to reflect her childlike nature. Ellie's tattoo of a moth was designed by California-based artist Natalie Hall after the team struggled to settle on a design. Hall drew the tattoo on a developer's arm so the team could visualize it. Druckmann felt that moths' obsession with light mirrored Ellie's obsession throughout the game, as well as giving her a reminder of Joel.  Writing  The Last of Us: Left Behind (2014) was written to specifically focus on the relationship between Ellie and Riley, and to recount the events that defined their later personalities. Druckmann was also inspired by wars that took place in Syria and Afghanistan; he felt that, like Ellie, conflict was familiar to the children in those countries. Left Behind sees Riley's behavior change Ellie, resulting in the latter's focus to fight in order to save those close to her. The team was also interested in Ellie's behavior around Riley; she is perceived as being more playful. In Left Behind, Ellie and Riley share a kiss; the team considered omitting the kiss from the game, but felt that it was imperative to the story and strengthened the relationship. Though initially he only felt that Ellie viewed Riley as an influence, Druckmann later considered her romantic appeal, and decided to explore the concept. For Part II, Druckmann recalled the team's excitement to explore Ellie further as a protagonist, particularly developing the loss of her innocence, comparing it to the feeling of the writers of Breaking Bad (2008‚Äì2015) when given the opportunity to explore Walter White. The team discussed creating a sequel without Ellie and Joel, but felt that they were less interesting. Ellie's excitement for astronomy was based on Johnson's own interests, while her obsession with comics is based on Druckmann's childhood. Part II co-writer and narrative lead Halley Gross felt that Ellie's decision to track down Abby was motivated by her desire to overcome her PTSD more than her desire to kill Abby. Gross, who has suffered from PTSD, considered it her responsibility to accurately depict the subject matter; she wanted players who might have suffered with trauma to understand that they are not alone. The writers wanted to deconstruct the perception of violence in Joel and Ellie: while Joel is indifferent and practical, Ellie kills to maintain a \\"culture of honor\\" by attaching violence to her ego. Some of the team considered Ellie's obsession with Abby akin to a drug addiction, and that Dina left as she felt that the obsession would never end. Gross considered the game's final shot, wherein Ellie leaves behind the guitar that Joel gave her, represented Ellie moving on from his death to a new chapter. Druckmann felt that it represented Ellie finally overcoming her ego, but preferred that the player create their own interpretation.  Gameplay  For The Last of Us, Ellie's artificial intelligence (AI) required significant overhauling of the game engine. The team had her stay close to Joel, to avoid being viewed by players as a burden. AI programmer Max Dyckhoff said that, to ensure Ellie made realistic decisions during gameplay, he considered \\"what she was going through\\" and \\"what her relationship with Joel and the enemies would be\\". During the winter segment of The Last of Us, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change, as well as the knowledge of Ellie's immunity, was kept secret prior to the game's release to surprise players.  Character  Ellie is described as \\"mature beyond her years\\" as a result of the circumstances of her environment. She is characterized as strong, witty, and \\"a little rough around the edges\\". Her emotional trauma is accentuated after her encounter with David. Having lost many people in her life, she suffers from severe monophobia and survivor's guilt. This results in her becoming a very hardened person; she uses violence without hesitation and frequently swears. Ellie also feels worthless, believing her life is a burden, and that her death would be beneficial for others. While she shows initiative, she is not as adept at survival as Joel, being somewhat impulsive and na√Øve, and unable to swim. Despite this, she displays great physical resilience, emotional strength and complete fearlessness, as demonstrated by her ability to look after both herself and Joel when he is severely injured. She constantly perseveres in the face of the many often dire situations that her travels put her through. Left Behind features a scene in which Ellie kisses her female friend Riley. Druckmann stated in interviews that he considers her to be a fully realized lesbian character. At the beginning of The Last of Us Part II, Ellie is aimless and struggles to deal with Joel's lie.  Appearances  A 19-year-old Ellie in The Last of Us Part II Ellie's mother Anna was forced to give her up shortly after she was born, and she was initially raised by Anna's friend Marlene. Ellie attends a military boarding school in the Boston quarantine zone, where she befriends Riley Abel, a fellow rebel who protects her from bullies, as depicted in the comic book series The Last of Us: American Dreams. During the events of Left Behind, which is set three weeks before The Last of Us, Riley returns after a long absence and tells Ellie that she has joined the Fireflies, a revolutionary militia group. Riley abandons her Firefly pendant when Ellie pleads for her to remain, and they kiss. After they are bitten by Infected, the two consider suicide, but choose to spend their final hours together. However, Ellie survives and discovers she is immune to infection. In The Last of Us, a wounded Marlene tasks Joel with escorting Ellie to the Fireflies to help them develop a vaccine from her immunity. Ellie is initially annoyed by Joel's surliness, but they develop a bond. Upon learning that he intends to leave her with his younger brother Tommy and return to Boston, she runs away. After Joel pursues her, she confronts him, insisting that he not abandon her, and they continue their journey. Ellie becomes traumatized and withdrawn after an encounter in which she is assaulted and nearly murdered by a band of cannibals, forcing her to hack their leader David to death with a machete. Joel and Ellie finally reach the Fireflies; Joel discovers that, in to create a vaccine, the Fireflies must kill Ellie during surgery to remove the mutant strain of the fungus from her brain. He kills Marlene and the Fireflies, makes his way to the operating room, and carries the unconscious Ellie to safety. Joel lies to Ellie, telling her that the Fireflies had already found dozens of other immune people and had stopped seeking a cure. When Ellie confronts him, describing her survivor's guilt and her urge to know the truth, Joel reassures her that he is telling the truth. The two settle down in Tommy's community in Jackson, Wyoming. In The Last of Us Part II, Ellie returns to the hospital and discovers the truth. She is angry with Joel, feeling her life would have mattered had the surgery gone ahead. The relationship between the two is strained, but Ellie promises Joel that she will try to forgive him. Ellie helplessly witnesses Joel's murder at the hands of the militia soldier Abby, the daughter of a Firefly surgeon that Joel killed while saving Ellie. Ellie goes with Tommy, her girlfriend Dina, and friend Jesse to Seattle, Washington to exact revenge. Along the way, Ellie reveals her immunity to Dina, and Dina reveals she is pregnant by Jesse. After Ellie kills several members of Abby's group, Abby confronts them, kills Jesse, shoots Tommy, and overpowers Ellie and Dina. She spares them and warns them to leave Seattle. Some time later, Ellie and Dina are living on a farm with Dina's baby, JJ, but Ellie suffers from post-traumatic stress. Despite Dina's pleas, Ellie tracks Abby to Santa Barbara, California, and frees her from a group of bandits. She is about to kill Abby and loses her two fingers, but lets her go. Ellie returns to the farmhouse and finds it empty. She struggles to play Joel's guitar with her missing fingers, recalls her promise to forgive Joel, and leaves.  Reception  alt=A 30-year-old woman with long, blonde hair, smiling at someone to the right of the camera. Ellie's character received generally positive feedback. Jason Killingsworth of Edge praised Ellie's complexity and commended Naughty Dog for not having made her \\"a subordinate ... precocious teen girl that Joel must babysit\\". Ashley Reed and Andy Hartup of GamesRadar named Ellie one of the \\"most inspirational female characters in games\\", writing that she is \\"one of the most modern, realistic characters ever designed\\". Eurogamers Ellie Gibson commended the character's strength and vulnerability, praising the game's subversion of the damsel in distress clich√©. GamesRadar listed Ellie among the best characters of the video game generation, stating that her courage exceeds that of most male characters. IGNs Greg Miller compared Ellie to Elizabeth from BioShock Infinite (2013), and felt that the former was a \\"much more rounded out, full- fledged\\" character. Conversely, Game Informers Kimberley Wallace felt that the game focused too much on Joel, \\"hardly capitalizing on Ellie's importance\\", and Chris Suellentrop of The New York Times judged that Ellie is cast \\"in a secondary, more subordinate role\\". Critics praised the relationship between Ellie and Joel. Matt Helgeson of Game Informer wrote that the relationship was \\"poignant\\" and \\"well-drawn\\", Joystiqs Richard Mitchell found it \\"genuine\\" and emotional, and IGNs Colin Moriarty identified it as a highlight of the game. Eurogamers Oli Welsh felt the characters were developed with \\"real patience and skill\\". Philip Kollar of Polygon found the relationship was assisted by the game's optional conversations. Wallace of Game Informer named Joel and Ellie one of the \\"best gaming duos of 2013\\", appreciating their interest in protecting each other. Game Informers Kyle Hilliard compared Joel and Ellie's relationship to that of the Prince and Elika from Prince of Persia (2008), writing that both duos care deeply for one another, and praising the \\"emotional crescendo\\" in The Last of Us, which he judged had not been achieved in Prince of Persia. PlayStation Official Magazines David Meikleham named Joel and Ellie the best characters in a PlayStation 3 game. Following the release of The Last of Us: Left Behind, Ellie's relationship with Riley was commended by reviewers. GameSpots Tom McShea felt a new appreciation for Ellie by seeing her actions around Riley. The Daily Telegraphs Tim Martin praised the characters' interactions, and Eurogamers Stace Harman felt that Left Behind improves the understanding of Joel and Ellie's relationship. Kotakus Kirk Hamilton described Ellie and Riley's kiss as \\"video gaming's latest breakthrough moment\\", declaring it \\"a big deal\\". Keza MacDonald of IGN wrote that the kiss was \\"so beautiful and natural and funny that [she] was left dumbstruck\\". IGNs Luke Karmali questioned Naughty Dog's motivation behind the kiss, noting the \\"bait-and-switch\\" in which they made players care for the character before revealing her sexuality, but ultimately dismissed this and commended the handling of Ellie's sexuality and the subtlety of the writing. Polygons Colin Campbell named Ellie and Riley among the best video game characters of the 2010s, citing their differences and eventual closeness. The character of Ellie won year-end awards for The Last of Us and Left Behind, including Best New Character from Hardcore Gamer and Most Valuable Character at the SXSW Gaming Awards for Left Behind; she received a nomination for Best Character from Destructoid. Ashley Johnson's performance also received various accolades: Performer at the 10th and 11th British Academy Video Games Awards, Outstanding Character Performance the 17th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, Lead Performance in a Drama at the 13th Annual National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards, Best Voice Actress at the Spike VGX 2013, and Best Performer from The Daily Telegraph. Johnson received acclaim for her performance in The Last of Us Part II. Destructoids Chris Carter praised her ability to play the character again after many years. Oli Welsh of Eurogamer found Johnson's performance to be \\"standout\\" due to her depiction of \\"rawness, vulnerability, and rage\\". GamesRadar+s Alex Avard considered Johnson's portrayal of suffering \\"nothing short of awards worthy\\". Regarding the character, Jonathon Dornbush of IGN wrote that Johnson added nuance to every element of Ellie.

Garry Shirts in 1974, who also invented StarPower, and is published by Simulation Training Systems, Inc. The simulation is intended to improve participants' cross-cultural competence by helping them understand the impact of culture on the behavior of people and organizations. Participants experience \\"culture shock\\" by traveling to and trying to interact with a culture in which the people have different values, different ways of behaving and different ways of solving problems.  Versions  There are three versions, one for high schools, charities and universities, one for middle school aged children called RaF√° RaF√°, and a professional version for business and government agencies. Origin \\"Around 1971, the U.S. Navy became very concerned about the behavior of American Sailors on leave in foreign ports, specifically Greece and Japan, and determined to do something to avoid incidents that were threatening relations between the United States and its allies. The Navy Personnel Research and Development Center approached Garry Shirts for assistance in creating a simulation that would teach naval personnel about the specific cultures where incidents had occurred. The Navy had created print material, readily available to the sailors, that explained Greek culture, so a lack of information was not the problem; it was the apparent failure to put it to use. Shirts decided that educating people was only part of the answer; it was also necessary to help them understand the nature of culture itself and its impact on human interaction. This would, he postulated, motivate them to learn how to interact effectively within any cultural environment. The result was the simulation game BaF√° BaF√°, which was originally accompanied by training modules, a comic strip, and language tapes. This was the first intercultural simulation, and when it was made generally available in 1974, it became the most widely used and well-known simulation in the field (Shirts 1974, 1975). It was founded on the idea of having trainees learn and become members of two contrasting cultures, Alpha and Beta, and then visiting each other. One is a more collectivist, people-oriented, touching culture, and the other, using a different language, is more individualistic and task oriented. The point of the interaction between members of the two cultures is to teach \\"that what seems irrational, contradictory, or unimportant to us in our culture may seem rational, consistent, and terribly important in another culture\\" (Shirts, 1995). Other simulations have been created in the field, but all owe some credit for inspiration to this one, the classic that has provided a model for intercultural simulation games.\\" Uses BaF√° BaF√° is adaptable and has been used in many different settings including with any groups that have different cultures, whether because of geographical location, political beliefs, race, organizational structure, mergers, sexual orientation, etc. Some examples of ways it has been used: * Training or teaching about diversity/inclusion. * Sociology classes. * Management Training. * Preparing people to travel to different cultures (Peace Corps, missionaries, military). * Medical professionals, staff and educators. * Orientations (student and staff).

In the first case, charges were based on claims made by a LGBT Turin group along with the Human Rights Committee of Piedmont and the City of Turin, regarding statements of Dr. De Mari, where she pointed out anal sex is recurring in satanism, homosexual associations to crimes and defined homosexuals as \\"new aryan race\\", and \\"idiots\\". Silvana De Mari was recognized guilty of defamation and sentenced to pay a fine of 1,500 euros in addition to a compensation of 5,000 euros for LGBT associations.

It is linked to Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin and based in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The January 2017 report issued by the United States Intelligence Community ‚Äì Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections ‚Äì described the Agency as a troll farm: \\"The likely financier of the so-called Internet Research Agency of professional trolls located in Saint Petersburg is a close ally of [Vladimir] Putin with ties to Russian intelligence,\\" commenting that \\"they previously were devoted to supporting Russian actions in Ukraine‚Äî[and] started to advocate for President-elect Trump as early as December 2015.\\" The agency has employed fake accounts registered on major social networking sites, discussion boards, online newspaper sites, and video hosting services to promote the Kremlin's interests in domestic and foreign policy including Ukraine and the Middle East as well as attempting to influence the 2016 United States presidential election. More than 1,000 employees reportedly worked in a single building of the agency in 2015. The extent to which a Russian agency has tried to influence public opinion using social media became better known after a June 2014 BuzzFeed News article greatly expanded on government documents published by hackers earlier that year.

The Internet Research Agency gained more attention by June 2015, when one of its offices was reported as having data from fake accounts used for biased Internet trolling. Subsequently, there were news reports of individuals receiving monetary compensation for performing these tasks. On 16 February 2018, a United States grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals and 3 Russian entities, including the Internet Research Agency, on charges of violating criminal laws with the intent to interfere \\"with U.S. elections and political processes\\", according to the Justice Department. In July 2020, President Trump revealed that he approved a cyberattack against the organization in 2018 that disrupted or shut down its operations.Calicchio, Dom, \\"Trump confirms he OK‚Äôd US cyberattack against Russia in 2018: report\\", Fox News, 11 July 2020  Origin  The company was founded in mid-2013.

Tactical  Journalists have written that Alexey Soskovets, who had participated in the Russian youth political community, was directly connected to the office in Olgino, and that his company, North-Western Service Agency, won 17 or 18 (according to different sources) contracts for organizing celebrations, forums and sport competitions for authorities of Saint Petersburg and that Soskovets' company was the only participant in half of those bids. In mid-2013 the agency won a tender for providing freight services for participants of Seliger camp. In 2014, according to Russian media, Internet Research Ltd. () was founded in March 2014, joined IRA's activity. The newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported that this company is a successor of Internet Research Agency Ltd. Internet Research Ltd. is considered to be linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the holding company Concord Management and Consulting. The \\"Trolls of Olgino\\" are considered to be his project. As of October 2014, the company belonged to Mikhail Bystrov, who had been the head of the police station at Moscow district of Saint Petersburg. Russian media point out that according to documents, published by hackers from Anonymous International, Concord Management is directly involved with trolling administration through the agency. Researchers cite e-mail correspondence, in which Concord Management gives instructions to trolls and receives reports on accomplished work. According to journalists, Concord Management organized banquets in the Kremlin and also cooperated with Voentorg and the Russian Ministry of Defence. Despite links to Alexei Soskovets, Nadejda Orlova, deputy head of the Committee for Youth Policy in Saint Petersburg, disputed a connection between her institution and the trolling offices. Finnish journalist Jessikka Aro, who reported extensively on the pro-Russian trolling activities in Finland, was targeted by an organized campaign of hate, disinformation and harassment.

Lentizdat.ru. 28 October 2014 A New York Times investigative reporter was told that the Internet Research Agency had shortened its name to \\"Internet Research,\\" and as of June 2015 had been asked to leave the 55 Savushkina Street location \\"a couple of months ago\\" because \\"it was giving the entire building a bad reputation.\\" A possibly related organization, FAN or Federal News Agency, was located in the building. The New York Times article describes various experiences reported by former employees of the Internet Research Agency at the Savushkina Street location. It also describes several disruptive hoaxes in the US and Europe, such as the Columbian Chemicals Plant explosion hoax, that may be attributable to the Internet Research Agency or similar Russian-based organizations. = 1 February 2018: Optikov street, 4, building 3, Lakhta-2 business center, Lakhta, Saint Petersburg = Reported by the Russian online newspaper DP.ru in December 2017, the office moved from the four-story building at 55 Savushkina Street to Lakhta on four floors at , 4 building 3 () near () in the Lakhta-2 business center () on 1 February 2018. Beginning in February 2018, they are also known as the \\"Lakhta Trolls\\" ().  Other cities  Novaya Gazeta reported that, according to Alexey Soskovets, head of the office in Olgino, North-Western Service Agency was hiring employees for similar projects in Moscow and other cities in 2013.  Work organization  More than 1,000 paid bloggers and commenters reportedly worked only in a single building at Savushkina Street in 2015. Many other employees work remotely. According to BuzzFeed News, more than 600 people were generally employed in the trolls' office earlier, in June 2014. Each commentator has a daily quota of 100 comments. Trolls take shifts writing mainly in blogs on LiveJournal and Vkontakte, about subjects along the propaganda lines assigned. Included among the employees are artists who draw political cartoons. They work for 12 hours every other two days. A blogger's quota is ten posts per shift, each post at least 750 characters. A commenter's norm is 126 comments and two posts per account. Each blogger is in charge of three accounts. Employees at the Olgino office earned 25,000 Russian rubles per month; those at the Savushkina Street office earned approximately 40,000 Russian rubles. In May 2014, Fontanka.ru described schemes for plundering the federal budget, intended to go toward the trolling organization. In 2017 another whistleblower said that with bonuses and long working hours the salary can reach 80,000 rubles. An employee interviewed by The Washington Post described the work:  Trolling themes  According to the testimonies of the investigative journalists and former employees of the offices, the main topics for posts included: * Criticism of Alexei Navalny, his sponsors, and Russian opposition in general; * Criticism of Ukraine's and the United States' foreign policies, and of the top politicians of these states; * Praise for Vladimir Putin and the policy of the Russian Federation. * Praise for and defense of Bashar al-Assad. Journalists have written that themes of trolling were consistent with those of other Russian propaganda outlets in topics and timing. Technical points used by trolls were taken mainly from content disseminated by RT (formerly Russia Today). A 2015 BBC News investigation identified the Olgino factory as the most likely producer of a September 2015 \\"Saiga 410K review\\" video where an actor posing as U.S. soldier shoots at a book that turns out to be a Quran, which sparked outrage. BBC News found among other irregularities that the soldier's uniform is not used by the U.S. military and is easily purchased in Russia, and that the actor filmed was most likely a bartender from Saint Petersburg related to a troll factory employee. The citizen-journalism site Bellingcat identified the team from Olgino as the real authors of a video attributed to the Azov Battalion in which masked soldiers threaten the Netherlands for organizing the referendum on the Ukraine‚ÄìEuropean Union Association Agreement.  Organized anti-Ukrainian campaign  In the beginning of April 2014 there began an organized online campaign to shift public opinion in the Western world in a way that would be useful for Russian authorities regarding the Russian military intervention in Ukraine in 2014. Hacked and leaked documents from that time contain instructions for commenters posting at the websites of Fox News, The Huffington Post, TheBlaze, Politico, and WorldNetDaily. The requirement for the working hours for the trolls is also mentioned: 50 comments under news articles per day. Each blogger has to manage six accounts on Facebook, post at least three posts every day, and participate twice in the group discussions. Other employees have to manage 10 accounts on Twitter, publishing 50 tweets every day. Journalists concluded that Igor Osadchiy was a probable leader of the project, and the campaign itself was run by Internet Research Agency Ltd. Osadchiy denied his connection to the agency. The company is also one of the main sponsors of an anti-Western exhibition Material Evidence. In the beginning of 2016, Ukraine's state-owned news agency Ukrinform claimed to expose a system of bots in social networks, which called for violence against the Ukrainian government and for starting \\"The Third Maidan\\". They reported that the organizer of this system is the former anti-Ukrainian combatant Sergiy Zhuk from Donbass. He allegedly performed his Internet activity from Vnukovo District in Moscow.  Reactions   Foreign  In March 2014, the Polish edition of Newsweek expressed suspicion that Russia was employing people to \\"bombard\\" its website with pro- Russian comments on Ukraine-related articles. Poland's governmental computer emergency response team later confirmed that pro-Russia commentary had flooded Polish Internet portals at the start of the Ukrainian crisis. German-language media websites were also flooded with pro-Russia comments in the spring of 2014. In late May 2014, the hacker group Anonymous International began publishing documents received from hacked emails of Internet Research Agency managers. In May‚ÄìJune 2014, Internet trolls invaded news media sites and massively posted pro-Russian comments in broken English. In March 2015 a service enabling censorship of sources of anti-Ukrainian propaganda in social networks inside Ukraine was launched.TrolleyBust service (in Ukrainian and Russian). The United States Justice Department announced the indictment on 16 February 2018, of the Internet Research Agency while also naming more than a dozen individual suspects who allegedly worked there as part of the special counsel's investigation into criminal interference with the 2016 election.  Assessments  Russian bloggers Anton Nosik, Rustem Adagamov, and Dmitriy Aleshkovskiy have said that paid Internet-trolls don't change public opinion. Their usage is just a way to steal budget money. Leonid Volkov, a politician working for Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, suggests that the point of sponsoring paid Internet trolling is to make the Internet so distasteful that ordinary people are not willing to participate. The Columbian Chemicals Plant explosion hoax on 11 September 2014, was the work of Internet Research Agency.  Additional activities of organizers  Based on the documents published by Anonymous International, Concord Management and Consulting was linked to the funding of several media outlets in Ukraine and Russia, including Kharkiv News Agency, News of Neva, Newspaper About Newspapers, Business Dialog, and Journalist Truth. The Columbian Chemicals Plant explosion hoax of 11 September 2014, which claim an explosion at a chemical plant in Centerville, St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, has been attributed in June 2015, by The New York Times Magazine, as \\"a highly coordinated disinformation campaign\\" and that the \\"virtual assault\\" was the work of the Internet Research Agency. Three months later, the same accounts posted false messages on Twitter about an Ebola outbreak in Atlanta under the keyword #EbolaInAtlanta, quickly relayed and picked up by users living in the city. A video was then posted on YouTube, showing a medical team treating an alleged Ebola victim at Atlanta Airport. On the same day, a different group launched a rumor on Twitter under the keyword #shockingmurderinatlanta, reporting the death of a disarmed black woman shot by police. Again, a blurry and poorly filmed video is broadcast to support the rumor. Between July 2014 and September 2017, the IRA used bots and trolls on Twitter to sow discord about the safety of vaccines. The campaign used sophisticated Twitter bots to amplify highly polarizing pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine messages containing the hashtag #VaccinateUS. In September 2017 Facebook said that ads had been \\"geographically targeted\\". Facebook revealed that during the 2016 United States presidential election, IRA had purchased advertisements on the website for US$100,000, 25% of which were geographically targeted to the U.S. Facebook's chief security officer said that the ads \\"appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum\\". According to a 17 October 2017 BuzzFeed News report, IRA duped American activists into taking real action via protests and self-defense training in what would seem to be a further attempt to exploit racial grievances. On 16 February 2018, the Internet Research Agency, along with 13 Russian individuals and two other Russian organizations, was indicted following an investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller with charges stemming from \\"impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of government.\\" On 23 March 2018, The Daily Beast revealed new details about IRA gathered from leaked internal documents, which showed that IRA used Reddit and Tumblr as part of its influence campaign. On the same day, Tumblr announced that they had banned 84 accounts linked to IRA, saying that they had spread misinformation through conventional postings rather than advertisements. In October 2018 the US Justice Department filed charges against Russian accountant Elena Khusyaynova for working with the IRA to influence not only the 2016 elections but also the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.  Rallies and protests organized by IRA in the United States  Michael Moore at the anti-Trump rally in New York City, November 12, 2016, which was allegedly organized by a Russian group. On 4 April 2016, a rally in Buffalo, New York, protested the death of India Cummings, a black woman who had recently died in police custody. IRA's \\"Blacktivist\\" Facebook account actively promoted the event and reached out directly to local activists on Facebook Messenger asking them to circulate petitions and print. \\"Blacktivist\\" supplied the petitions and poster artwork. On 16 April 2016, a rally protesting the death of Freddie Gray attracted large crowds in Baltimore. IRA's \\"Blacktivist\\" Facebook group promoted and organized the event, including reaching out to local activists. On 23 April 2016, a small group of white-power demonstrators held a rally they called \\"Rock Stone Mountain\\" at Stone Mountain Park near Stone Mountain, Georgia. They were confronted by a large group of anti-racist counterprotestors, and some violent clashes ensued. The protest was heavily promoted by IRA accounts on Tumblr, Twitter, and Facebook, and the IRA website blackmatters.com. The IRA used its Blacktivist Facebook account to reach out, to no avail, to activist and academic Barbara Williams Emerson, the daughter of Hosea Williams, to help promote the protests. Afterward, RT blamed anti- racists for violence and promoted two videos shot at the event. On 2 May 2016, a second rally was held in Buffalo, New York, protesting the death of India Cummings. Like the 4 April rally, the event was heavily promoted by IRA's \\"Blacktivist\\" Facebook account, including attempted outreach to local activists. On 21 May 2016, two competing rallies were held in Houston to alternately protest against and defend the recently opened Library of Islamic Knowledge at the Islamic Da'wah Center. The \\"Stop Islamization of Texas\\" rally was organized by the Facebook group \\"Heart of Texas\\". The posting for the event encouraged participants to bring guns. A spokesman for the group conversed with the Houston Press via email but declined to give a name. The other rally, \\"Save Islamic Knowledge\\", was organized by another Facebook group called \\"United Muslims of America\\" for the same time and location. Both Facebook groups were later revealed to be IRA accounts. On 25 May 2016, the Westboro Baptist Church held its annual protest of Lawrence High School graduation ceremonies in Lawrence, Kansas. The \\"LGBT United\\" Facebook group organized a counter protest to confront the Westboro Baptist Church protest, including by placing an ad on Facebook and contacting local people. About a dozen counter showed up. Lawrence High School students did not participate in the counter protest because they were skeptical of the counter protest organizers. \\"LGBT United\\" was an IRA account that appears to have been created specifically for this event. \\"LGBT United\\" organized a candlelight vigil on 25 June 2016, for the Pulse nightclub shooting victims in Orlando, Florida. Philando Castile shooting in July 2016 IRA's \\"Don't Shoot\\" Facebook group and affiliated \\"Don't Shoot Us\\" website tried to organize a protest outside St. Paul, Minnesota police headquarters on 10 July 2016, in response to the 6 July fatal police shooting of Philando Castile. Some local activists became suspicious of the motives behind the event because St. Paul police were not involved in the shooting. Castille had been shot by a St. Anthony police officer in nearby Falcon Heights. Local activists contacted \\"Don't Shoot.\\" After being pressed on who they were and who supported them, \\"Don't Shoot\\" agreed to move the protest to St. Anthony police headquarters. The concerned local activists investigated further and urged not to participate after deciding \\"Don't Shoot\\" was a \\"total troll job.\\" \\"Don't Shoot\\" organizers eventually relinquished control of the event to local organizers, who subsequently declined to accept any money offered by \\"Don't Shoot\\" to cover expenses. A Black Lives Matter protest rally was held in Dallas on 10 July 2016. A \\"Blue Lives Matter\\" counter protest was held across the street. The \\"Blue Lives Matter\\" protest was organized by the \\"Heart of Texas\\" Facebook group controlled by IRA. The Blacktivist Facebook group organized a rally in Chicago to honor Sandra Bland on 16 July 2016, the first anniversary of her death. The rally was held in front of the Chicago Police Department's Homan Square building. They passed around petitions calling for a Civilian Police Accountability Council ordinance. 17 \\"Florida Goes Trump\\" rallies were held across Florida on 25 August 2016. The rallies were organized by IRA using their \\"Being Patriotic\\" Facebook group and \\"march_for_trump\\" Twitter account. The \\"SecuredBorders\\" Facebook group organized the \\"Citizens before refugees\\" protest rally on 27 August 2016, at the City Council Chambers in Twin Falls, Idaho. Only a small number of people showed up for the three hour event, most likely because it was Saturday and the Chambers were closed. \\"SecureBorders\\" was an IRA account. The \\"Safe Space for Muslim Neighborhood\\" rally was held outside the White House on 3 September 2016. At least 57 people attended the event organized by the IRA's \\"United Muslims of America\\" Facebook group. \\"BlackMattersUS\\", an IRA website, recruited activists to participate in protests on the days immediately following 20 September 2016, police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina. The IRA paid for expenses such as microphones and speakers. The \\"Miners for Trump\\" rallies held in Pennsylvania on 2 October 2016, were organized by IRA's \\"Being Patriotic\\" Facebook group. The IRA ran its most popular ad on Facebook on 19 October 2016. The ad was for the IRA's Back the Badge Facebook group and showed a badge with the words \\"Back the Badge\\" in front of police lights under the caption \\"Community of people who support our brave Police Officers.\\" A large rally was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 22 October 2016, protesting the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. BlackMattersUS recruited unwitting local activists to organize the rally. BlackMattersUS provided one activist with a bank card to pay for rally expenses. Anti-Hillary Clinton \\"Texit\\" rallies were held across Texas on 5 November 2016. The \\"Heart of Texas\\" Facebook group organized the rallies around the theme of Texas seceding from the United States if Hillary Clinton is elected. The group contacted the Texas Nationalist Movement, a secessionist organization, to help with organizing efforts, but they declined to help. Small rallies were held in Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin, and other cities. No one attended the Lubbock rally. A Trump protest called \\"Trump is NOT my President\\" attracted 5,000 to 10,000 in Manhattan on 12 November 2016. Marched from Union Square to Trump Tower. The protest was organized by BlackMattersUS. The IRA's \\"United Muslims of America\\" Facebook group organized the \\"Make peace, not war!\\" protest on 3 June 2017, outside Trump Tower in New York City. It is unclear whether anyone attended this protest or instead attended the \\"March for Truth\\" affiliated protest held on the same day.  Lawsuit  In May 2015, a trolling company employee Lyudmila Savchuk in Saint Petersburg sued her employer for labor violations, seeking to disclose its activities. Ivan Pavlov from human rights defending initiative Team 29 represented Savchuk, and the defendant \\"troll-factory\\" agreed to pay Savchuk her withheld salaries and to restore her job. Savchuk later described extreme psychological pressure at the work place, with jokes circulating among employees that \\"one can remain sane in the factory for two months maximum\\", as result of constant switching between different personalities that the workers are expected to design and maintain during work time.  Indictments  Indictment for interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections On 16 February 2018, 13 individuals were indicted by the Washington, D.C. grand jury for alleged illegal interference in the 2016 presidential elections, during which they strongly supported the candidacy of Donald Trump, according to special counsel Robert Mueller's office. IRA, Concord Management and Concord Catering were also indicted. It was alleged that IRA was controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The indicted individuals are Dzheykhun Nasimi Ogly Aslanov, Anna Vladislavovna Bogacheva, Maria Anatolyevna Bovda, Robert Sergeyevich Bovda, Mikhail Leonidovich Burchik, Mikhail Ivanovich Bystrov, Irina Viktorovna Kaverzina, Aleksandra Yuryevna Krylova, Vadim Vladimirovich Podkopaev, Sergey Pavlovich Polozov, Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin, Gleb Igorevitch Vasilchenko, and Vladimir Venkov. None of the defendants are in custody. On 15 March, President Trump imposed financial sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act on the 13 Russian and organizations indicted by Mueller, preventing them from entering the United States to answer the charges should they wish to. In October 2018 Russian accountant Elena Khusyaynova was charged with interfer–µnce in the 2016 and 2018 US elections. She is alleged to have been working with the IRA. She was said to have managed a $16 million budget.http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/10/19/khusyaynova.complaint.pdf Timeline of the Internet Research Agency interference in United States elections  2014 * April: The IRA creates a department called the \\"translator project\\".

This is the only listed company belonging to the scope of consolidation and is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. On 31 December 2013, the stock market capitalization reached CHF 7.4 billion. The main shareholders are \\"Emesta Holding AG\\" with 60.82% and Miriam Blocher with 8.89%.  Organization  Ems- Chemie is represented in 22 countries and produces at 26 production sites in 16 countries, with the main location in Domat/Ems. In 2013, the Group's production focus was in Europe (Switzerland 46.2%, Germany 12.2%), followed by the USA (9.2%) and Asia (China 7.3%, Japan 6.6%). The largest sales markets of the Group are Germany (21.9%), China (14.0%) and the USA (11.9%). The Ems Group is structured in branches for high-performance Polymere (Ems-Grivory and Ems-Eftec), with sales of CHF 1.6 billion, and specialty chemicals (Ems- Griltec and Ems-Patvag), with sales of CHF 0.3 billion. Ems-Eftec offers equipment and materials for the automobile industry in the fields of gluing (body parts), densities (welding seams), vapors (vibration of the sheet metal) and protection (plastisols for the body). Ems-Grivory produces high- performance polymers that are delivered to customers as granules. From these high-performance polymers, the customers manufacture plastic parts, for automobile engineering, mobile phones, display windows, LEDs, packaging, baby bottles, eyeglasses, etc. Ems-Griltech produces hot-melt adhesives (for clothing, automobile electronics, packaging, composites) as well as separating and adhesive yarns for the textile industry, fibers for press felts (ie. paper machine felts), powder coatings (ie. glass and aluminum faucets, machines, appliances, radiators) which are heat, UV and cold resistant. Ems-Patvag develops and produces igniters (ei. airbags, belt tensioners) for safety systems in the automobile sector.  History  Factories Ems Valley around 1920. On the left are the works of Ems-Chemie  The founding of Hovag  In 1936 Werner Oswald founded \\"Holzverzuckerungs AG\\" (\\"Hovag\\") based in Z√ºrich, for the production of, among other things, a fuel additive for motor vehicles made from wood ethyl alcohol using the Scholler method in Domat. On 23 August 1940, the Swiss Federal Council approved the production of 20,000 hl of fuel and secured its acquisition of the production costs. This was added to the gasoline and the higher costs were compensated by federal funding. Due to the scarcity of raw materials as a result of the Second World War, on 24 March 1941, a contract with delivery and pick up obligation of more than 98200 tons of fuel was made, with an end date of the 31. March 1955, including production costs, (including provisions and repayment of state employment contributions). Through this, until the end of the Second World War 30% of the fuel requirements were covered in Switzerland. In addition, on 25 June 1942, a further contract was created for the supply of 2000 tons of feed yeast per year, of which only a total of 2639 tons were delivered due to supply shortages. From 1944 to 1947, the company invested in patents and administrations AG (\\"Patvag AG\\"), a sister company of \\"Hovag\\", focused on hydropower plants, in order to secure their energy supplies. In 1948, Hovag began producing ammonia, in 1949 urea synthesis, and in the 1950s Hovag began with the production of caprolactam from which polyamide plastics and, from the subsidiary company, Fibron S.A., polyamide fibers (brand names Grilon) were made. Shortly afterwards, the first foreign sales company was founded, GRILON & Plastics Machinery Ltd. based in Dover (UK). In 1954 the \\"Hovag\\" was one of the largest employers with 1015 employees and consumed about half of the electrical energy of the canton of Graub√ºnden. [9] When, on 13 May 1956, a national referendum decided against the further subsidization of ¬´Hovag¬ª for the years 1956 to 1960 in the amount of CHF 28.3 million, it stopped the production of ethyl alcohol. In 1947, \\"Inventa AG\\" was founded for research and patent utilization (later, process engineering and plant engineering were combined). In the mid-1950s \\"Inventa\\" built more than 300 plants (117 in China) for caprolactam, plastics and synthetic fibers.  The years since 1960  In 1960 , \\"Hovag\\" was renamed \\"Emser Werke AG\\". The founding in 1962 of Chemie Holding Ems AG was listed for the first time on the Vorb√∂rse Zurich on 17 December 1962. In the 1960s, \\"Emser Werke AG\\" expanded its product portfolio on an ongoing basis and established independent subsidiaries. In 1963, EMS Patvag was founded for ignition systems. In 1972, Christoph Blocher, who had entered the legal department as a student in 1969, was elected chairman of the board of directors and delegate of the board of directors. In 1978, the various Ems companies were merged under the umbrella of the Chemie Holding Ems AG. On 23 February 1979, the founder Werner Oswald died in the middle of a meeting. Christoph Blocher continued to lead the company, began to focus on engineering plastics and changed the name to \\"Ems Chemie Holding AG\\" and \\"Ems Chemie AG\\" in 1981. In 1983, he was commissioned, by the founding Oswald family, to find a buyer for the shares of Ems Chemie Holding AG. Blocher decided to take over the Oswald family's own share package and therefore had the majority of votes at the company. In the following years the \\"Ems\\" expanded and took over several other companies. In 1988 \\"Ems\\" focused on the three business areas polymeric materials, fine chemicals (EMS Dottikon) and engineering. Amongst the new products, which were developed continuously, was a highly rigid polyamide in 1991. A year later the ¬´Ems¬ª celebrated its 50th birthday of production. In 1997, the \\"Ems Togo\\" business unit entered into a joint venture with H.B. Fuller Automotive USA, which appeared under the name of \\"Eftec\\". Three years later there was a joint venture between ¬´Eftec¬ª and the Czech company D-Plast to open up the Central and Eastern European market. In 2000, the group was made up of four main self-employed companies \\"Ems Grivory\\" (technical thermoplastics), \\"Ems Griltec\\" (technical fibers and adhesives), \\"Ems Primid\\" (thermosets), \\"Ems Services\\" (central services workshop Domat / Ems). The following year Blochers eldest daughter Magdalena Martullo joined the company. At the beginning of 2003, the Blocher family decided that the \\"Ems\\" should remain a publicly traded shares company and introduced the unit names shares. On 10 December 2003, Christoph Blocher was elected to the Federal Council. Since a Federal Council member is not allowed to have any economic connections, he gave up all his positions at the \\"Ems\\" group and sold his majority stake in \\"Ems Chemie-Holding AG\\" to his four children on 30 December. On 1 January 2004, his daughter, Magdalena, took over the group management as Vice-President and Delegate of the Board of Directors. In the same year \\"Ems Grivory\\" was divided into the independent areas \\"Ems GrivoryEuropa\\", \\"Ems Grivory America\\" and \\"Ems Grivory Asia\\". In 2005, Blocher's son Markus‚Äôs, ¬´Ems Dottikon¬ª, was split up as an independent company. The three sisters surrendered their shares to their brother and in return received shares in \\"Emesta Holding AG\\". This meant that the three sisters held the majority of shares of Ems-Chemie Holding. In the following year, the \\"Tegra\\" biomass power plant (wood-chip power plant) was put into operation, reducing CO2 emissions at the Domat / Ems plant by 80%. In 2007, Miriam Blocher reduced her stake in \\"Ems-Chemie Holding\\", the majority was now owned by Magdalena Martullo-Blocher and Rahel Blocher. \\"Ems Togo\\" took over all the joint venture shares of H.B. Fuller and changed the name to ¬´Ems Eftec¬ª.

Transport infrastructure  Between Chur and Domat/Ems runs the narrow-gauge railway line Chur-Domat/Ems of the Rhaetian Railway, which has three tracks since December 1959. Through this, standard gauge freight trains can reach the Ems- Chemie area directly. The RhB stop, Ems factory, serves the factory site directly. There are ideas to introduce normal passenger services to Ems factory in the future. For this purpose, however, the entire track system would have to be extended in three tracks to Ems factory. There is no proposed funding for this project.

It can be found in the South Island of New Zealand and is limited to the Christchurch and Banks Peninsula area. Taxonomy British amateur arachnologist Henry Roughton Hogg described this species in 1901 as Maoriana dendyi from a specimen collected in Christchurch and sent to him by Professor Arthur Dendy. A year later, Hogg discovered that the genus name Maoriana had already been allocated to a genus of mollusc, so he renamed the species Cantuaria dendyi. The genus name recalls Canterbury Province, the origin of the specimen. Other names for the genus have been Misgolas and Arbanitis.World Spider Catalog. (2015). Cantuaria dendyi (Hogg 1901). Retrieved March 26, 2015, from http://www.wsc.nmbe.ch/species/13295/Cantuaria- dendyi Valerie Todd felt the differences that Hogg had used to place C. dendyi in a new genus were not enough to separate it from the genus Arbanitis, so she reclassified it as Arbanitis dendyi. Additionally, the family Idiopidae was previously considered part of the Ctenizidae. The first spiders of this genus to be found, Cantuaria dendyi is the type species of the genus. Description Cantuaria dendyi is one of over 40 species of Cantuaria recognised today. The main identifying feature of this genus is the presence of a rastellum. This is a set of strong spines used for digging when forming burrows, and are attached to the front of the chelicerae (fang-like mouth pieces). Another way to determine Cantuaria is the presence of only 4 small spinnerets for spinning silk. They are large creatures and the medium size is approximately 2.3 cm with the largest growing up to 3 cm long. However, this size is measured from eye ridge to the end of the abdomen. Therefore, nothing beyond the eye ridge such as legs and fang bases are accounted for and consequently, these spiders are potentially bigger than measurements state. C. dendyi have an abdomen that is cream in colour, with a number of small black patches, which leave three broken pale chevrons on the rear of the abdomen. Both male and females individuals display this chevron pattern on the abdomen, however is not as clear on males as on females.Forster, R. R., Wilton, C. L. (1968). The Spiders of New Zealand: Part 2. Dunedin, New Zealand: Otago Museum Trust Board. Legs are dark orange brown, as are the palps (segmented appendages near the mouth) of this species Legs differ between sexes. Thick scopula (dense tufts of hair) covers the tarsus and anterior half of the metatarsus of the first two pairs of legs on females, whereas males have thick scopula on the ventral surfaces of both the tarsus and metatarsus on the first two pairs of legs  Distribution and habitat Cantuaria are endemic to New Zealand, having been present for 85 million years since New Zealand split from Gondwana. They are predominantly found throughout the South Island of New Zealand although they have been known to reside in the lower part of the North Island up to the Whanganui region. New Zealand's true trapdoor spiders (Idiopidae) prefer grassland regions and have adapted to the change in landscape from human presence and the increase in agriculture. Highest numbers can be found along fence lines and beside roads in self-made burrows with thin lids and the average depth of these burrows ranges between 15 and 30 centimeters. There are exceptions to this as some species such as C. huttoni, can be found on forest floors, however, these spiders usually have an open burrow as opposed to having a ‚Äútrapdoor‚Äù. Cantuaria are masters of camouflage and accordingly, they are very hard to find. They incorporate nearby material into the silk so that the trapdoors look like the surrounding environment. Once their burrow is built, they do not wander far and consequently, species are scattered in distribution. Cantuaria dendyi is limited to the Christchurch and Banks Peninsula area in the South Island of New Zealand V. Smith, personal communication, March 25, 2015 Life cycle and phenology One of the most distinguishing characteristics of the Cantuaria dendyi, like other Cantuaria, is that it lives its life in a burrow under the ground. The burrow of C. dendyi varies from 4-8 inches (about 10‚Äì20 cm) long and is covered by a trapdoor. These spiders will live their entire life in the burrow and are known to be extremely sedentary. When males are mature enough, they undergo their final moult and abandon their homes to find a mate. They leave in early winter, anytime between April to June, and some will not eat once they leave. Females remain in the burrow their entire life only exiting in the case of an emergency. Not much is known about the mating sequence of Cantuaria, but from periodic observations some behaviors can be described. The male will approach the female's burrow with his front legs straight out, vibrating them at regular intervals on the door This drumming could signal the female of his presence, but it is unknown if she lets him in or if he lifts up the trapdoor himself. An interesting fact about Cantuaria is that the offspring will live in the mother's burrow for roughly 18 months until the spiderling is ready to adventure on its own. Vikki Smith, a PhD candidate at Lincoln University described mother Cantuaria being protective of their children. During one of her observations when she placed a Caribid beetles in the burrow of a Cantuaria and her spiderling, the spiderling ran out while the mother stayed behind to fight the beetle. Vikki later pulled out only the leg of the beetle; the mother had won. Cantuaria are long-lived creatures that can survive for up to 20 years.Crowe, A. (2007). Which New Zealand Spider? North Shore, New Zealand: Penguin Group. Cantuaria seem to be designed for a long and sustained life, with a slow metabolism, sedentary life, and spending their time at the bottom of their burrow only opening the trapdoor to catch an insect for food. Diet and foraging Cantuaria are able to use their burrows to their advantage when it comes to eating. Not all Cantuaria have trapdoors, but C. dendyi are one of the species with a lid to their burrow. The spider sit in its hole, with the trapdoor slightly open, and when it feels the vibration of a passing insect, the Cantuaria jumps out and grabs it. The spider lunges out of its tunnel, above the insect, so it is able to catch its food using its fangs on the way back down. Unlike some spiders, Cantuaria do not wrap their prey in silk, but drag the victim into the depths of the burrow, with the trapdoor closing overhead. These spiders are carnivorous and their diet includes whatever passing victim gets caught, most likely some sort of insect. At the bottom of these spider's burrows, fragments of beetle remains have been found. Cantuaria must eat their prey in the burrow and it is important that the spider never jumps so far out from the burrow that the trapdoor closes behind it, because the spider will then be locked out. From observation, when Cantuaria leap out of their burrow to catch prey, they always grasp onto the edge of the hole with their hind leg to prevent the door from closing. Researchers have been successful at luring and capturing Cantuaria using a tethered mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) beetle, which is quicker and causes much less environmental damage than digging the spider out of its burrow. These spiders are very sedentary, usually only sitting in their burrows waiting for a passing victim. They operate in a constant low temperature because they are underground, and they live for about 20 years. With these factors we can assume Cantuaria might have a low metabolic rate. With a low metabolic rate and a carnivorous diet, all this spider needs to do is wait for an unsuspecting victim to pass its burrow so that it can jump out and find its next meal. Predators, parasites and diseases Even though Cantuaria seem to be safe living their life underground, there are always predators who will find a way to surpass that obstacle and feed on the spider. The greatest of these enemies appears to be New Zealand's largest black hunting wasp, Priocnemis monachus. Cantuaria are rather large spiders, so it makes sense that a large wasp would seek out a hefty meal for their growing larvae. Species of Cantuaria that live in their burrow without a trapdoor are most at risk, but this wasp is known to be strong enough to pull the lid open or bite clean through it, which puts C. dendyi at risk. The wasps have also been known to pretend to be an insect at the entrance and when the spider attacks, the wasp immediately grasps it. Some wasps also proceed to take over the spider's burrow, opening and closing the trapdoor as it pleases. New Zealand entomologist Anthony Harris has observed interactions between Priocnemis monachus and Cantuaria. He recorded that a wasp will find a trapdoor spider outside their burrow and stalk it. The spider will flee but as it turns to face the wasp (rearing up as it does so) a struggle ensues. The wasp will sting the spider several times until the spider collapses, although still alive. The wasp will then drag the body of the spider back to its already prepared nest. The spider is placed in a cell of the nest in which a wasp will lay an egg. The larva that develops will start feeding on the inert but still living body of the spider. Only at the end will the wasp larva eat the vital organs of the spider, which finally dies. When reviewing Cantuaria, Valerie Todd at the University of Otago, noted many species of this genus seem to be parasitised by mites. The mites were most commonly found clinging to the cephalothorax and were common on dendyi. Vikki Smith also found nematodes, or parasitic worms, inside of Cantuaria that seemed to have drowned. It is possible these spiders tried to escape the worm by leaving their burrow, and in doing so they put themselves at risk and got caught in water. Parasites and predators still have found a way to attach Cantuaria. Since many spiders take food up in liquid state, they are not likely to have internal parasites, other than a specific nematode species. Mites, however commonly parasitise this species and are found on the anterior part of the two sections that the spider in divided into (cephalothorax). Several species of Cantuaria have been found carrying the parasite nematode species Aranimermis giganteus in the abdomen, C. dendyi may also carry this parasitic nematode. Distinguishing traits Cantuaria is amongst the few spider genera whose members will look after offspring until they are able to build a burrow for themselves.V. Smith, personal communication, November, 2014 Another trait of Cantuaria dendyi is their noncannibalistic habits. Males and females were kept together in a box and there were no noted loss of limbs throughout this time. Some were huddled together under a grass sod; the weaker died first in this study. Cantuaria are long-lived creatures that can survive up to 20 years.

It is now operated as a venue for corporate, social and theatrical events. The Deco was designated a Grade II listed building in 2004. and originally featured a single large cinema room and theatre. Over the years the internal arrangement of the building has changed a couple of times and The Deco now consists of 3 main areas: A main 925 seat auditorium and 2 smaller 200 seater rooms, The Dor√© and The Glen, the latter being named after the original architect William Riddell Glen. The Deco features as part of the Northampton Heritage Trail , The Deco is now one of the largest venues for touring bands between London and Birmingham.  History  The Deco first opened on Saturday 2 May 1936 in a blaze of publicity as \\"the Savoy\\" described as \\"Northampton‚Äôs only super Cinema\\" and was reported to be \\"the last word in comfort\\". It was part of the ABC group designed by their prolific house architect William Riddell Glen and built in under 9 months on the site of the original Technical College. It was constructed in the International Modernistic style and is arguably the best remaining example of Glen‚Äôs work with all the main features still in place and sympathetically renovated. The Savoy was very popular and originally held almost 2000 people in the 696 seat circle and 1200 seat stalls. It was designed both as a cinema and theatre complete with orchestra pit. It hosted shows and concerts as well as films. In the 1950s it was renamed the \\"ABC\\" in line with the group‚Äôs national branding policy and was the local venue of choice for the touring bands of the 60s including the Beatles in both March and November 1963 the Rolling Stones in 1965 and infamously PJ Proby in 1965 when he was arrested for splitting his trousers on stage! A number of the 60s bands have returned to play the Deco in recent years including the Hollies, the Searchers and Billy J Kramer. In 1974 it was converted to a 3 screen complex by using the rear of the stalls with a dividing wall for the 2 smaller screens and leaving the main auditorium circle as the main \\"ABC 1‚Ä≥. By the mid-90s however the ABC, now renamed Cannon cinema, was unable to compete with the modern multiscreen complexes. The owning company (Credit Lyonnais, who had acquired Cannon studios and Cannon cinemas) also owned the MGM brand and built a new 9 screen MGM multiplex (now Cineworld) at Sixfields Leisure Park to replace the Cannon. After the Sixfields cinema opened, the Cannon finally closed its doors in 1995 with the appropriately named \\"Terminal Velocity\\".  Recent years  The building was derelict for 5 years until 2000 when it was purchased by a local Charitable Trust to be converted to a multi-purpose venue opening in October 2005 as the Deco The venue is operated by Stage Right Productions as a venue for corporate, social and theatrical events The Deco also host a wide variety of regular shows including an annual Christmas pantomime that is produced by Stage Right Productions  Current Facilities  The venue has over 7,250 sq ft of usable theatre or concert space in the main auditorium with an additional two large conference suites, The Glen and The Dor√©, offering a further 3,900 sq ft. The main auditorium can accommodate 925 seated or 1,200 standing in stalls and seating in circle, whilst the suites offer a capacity of 200 each when configured as a conference venue. In addition to the main auditorium and conference suites, the refurbishment saw various of the smaller rooms throughout the building which would have been projection rooms, storage rooms and offices converted to small meeting or conference rooms and these have also available to be hire.

Completed in 2014, the ship is long, wide with a gross tonnage of 51,872. 2015 seizure On 28 April 2015, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy intercepted and seized the ship, then sailing as Maersk Tigris, while it was transiting through Iranian territorial waters via the Strait of Hormuz. An initial instruction by the IRGC Navy to the Maersk Tigris to proceed further into Iranian territorial waters was not complied with, after which the Iranian Navy fired a warning shot across the bridge of the ship. The ship was then taken into Iranian custody. Given that the vessel is flagged under the Marshall Islands, which the United States bears security responsibility for, the U.S. Navy dispatched the destroyer USS Farragut after receiving a distress call from the Maersk Tigris. The vessel's charterer, the Danish shipping company Maersk, said Iran's seizure of a commercial vessel engaged in innocent passage through Iran's territorial waters in the internationally recognized shipping lane of the Strait of Hormuz was illegal. Maersk said it presumed the ship was detained because of an ongoing court case between Maersk Line and an Iranian company, but that Iran erred not only by failing to engage in normal protocol for arresting a ship, but by seizing property and personnel that do not belong to Maersk. The ship is chartered by Maersk Line and Maersk owns the ship's containers, but the ship itself is owned by Wide Golf Ltd, registered in Luxembourg, and is managed by Singapore-based Rickmers Shipmanagement. On 29 April 2015, Maersk said it had been informed by the Iranian Ports and Maritime Organization that an Iranian court had ordered it to pay $3.6 million in compensation to an Iranian company for the loss of 10 of its containers Maersk Line had shipped to Dubai in January 2005. In February 2015, an appeals court in Tehran ordered Maersk Line to pay the Iranian company $163,000. The Iranian company then appealed the case, seeking more money, which led to the $3.6 million judgment. Maersk said it had only learned on April 30 of the Iranian appeals court $3.6 million ruling, but that it had \\"not received any written or formal confirmation that the seizure and the cargo case are connected. According to maritime consultant William Watson, when an entity has a financial claim against a vessel's owners, the claimant can arrest the vessel when it is in port or at anchor. But in his decades in the maritime industry, he had never seen such a seizure carried on open seas. On 7 May 2015, Iran released the Maersk Tigris.

It appeared in the Mus√©e des familles from July 10 through August 11, 1852. The text was later revised and enlarged for publication in book form.  Plot  The story is set in Lima, Peru. A Jewish businessman named Samuel has promised to give his daughter Sarah as a wife to the rich mestizo, Andr√© Certa. But Sarah - who is very attracted to the Catholic religion - is in love with the young Indian chief Martin Paz. Following a knife fight at Samuel's house, in which Certa is hurt, Paz has to flee. He jumps in a raging river and everyone believes him dead, but he finds refuge with the Spanish nobleman Don V√©gal who takes a liking to him and places him under his protection. Later, Paz secretly encounters Certa with Samuel and, listening in on their conversation, he learns that Sarah is not Samuel's daughter but, rather, the daughter of a Spanish nobleman that Samuel rescued following a shipwreck. Before the wedding can take place, an Indian rebellion begins. The rebels attack Samuel's home, killing him, and Paz is able to escape with Sarah to V√©gal's house. Once there, V√©gal discovers that Sarah is his daughter, who he thought was dead. Certa attempts to get his revenge. Paz and V√©gal get away, but the Indians kidnap Sarah. V√©gal and Paz set off in pursuit, and discover that the Indians have condemned Sarah to death for taking Paz away from his tribal duties. She is to be executed by going over a waterfall while tied to a canoe. Paz arrives just in time, but he is unable to save her and they die together. Themes Among the subjects covered are anti-Semitism (see also: Off on a Comet), the struggle for independence, miscegenation and the role of aristocracy in public affairs.

The film is one of the studio's early films in color. Plot An opera is taking place at a theatre. The opera centers on Carmen, a white cat in a racy red dress and racy red high heels. In the opera, Carmen's mother, a pink hippo, urges Carmen to marry the count, a generous and wealthy but unattractive nobleman. Carmen, however, does not adore the count, and will therefore only marry whom she has affection for. The count comes to Carmen's place with various gifts (a reference to wartime rationing). But Carmen remains strong to her marital preference. Every time the count approaches the cat at her balcony, Carmen either bashes him back down or drops a heavy object. Carmen's mother then resorts to sending armored guards to Carmen's room, in an attempt to push Carmen to take the count. Carmen locks her room and writes a distress letter to someone named Tyrone. Carmen sends the message via bird. In another scene in the opera, Tyrone, who is played by Gandy Goose, receives the message carried by the bird. He then sets off in a flying horse to the William Tell Overture. Tyrone arrives just outside Carmen's home. The guards charge at him but Tyrone is able to overcome them. Eventually, with his flying horse, Tyrone comes to the elevated window of Carmen's room where he picks up Carmen before flying away.

The house produces both haute couture-inspired artisanal collections and ready-to-wear collections, with the former influencing the designs of the latter. Product lines include womenswear, menswear, fine jewelry, footwear, objects, fragrance, and home goods, among others. Known for deconstructive and avant-garde designs with unconventional materials, Maison Margiela has traditionally held live shows in unusual settings, for example empty metro stations and street corners. Models' faces are often obscured by fabric or long hair to direct attention to the clothes and design. With Maison Martin Margiela going public in 2002, Margiela resigned as creative designer in 2009 and John Galliano was appointed to the role in 2014. The company has collaborated on displays and designs with Barneys New York, Converse, G-Shock Opening Ceremony, Herm√®s, H&M;, L‚ÄôOreal, and Swarovski. History Formation and early years Maison Margiela was founded by Martin Margiela, a Belgian fashion designer, in 1988. Earlier, Margiela had studied fashion at the Royal Academy of Antwerp, and although he actually graduated a year earlier, in 1979, he is often mistaken for a member of the university's Avant-garde fashion collective the Antwerp Six. Among other influences, during the 1980s Margiela and other Belgian designers such as the Antwerp Six were inspired by deconstructive fashions introduced by Japanese avantgardists such as Rei Kawakubo‚Äîcreator of the label Comme des Gar√ßons. Margiela began utilizing the deconstructive style in the 1980s while a freelance designer in Milan, Italy, and early on his work would often reveal the garments‚Äô structure, for example intentionally exposed linings and seams. In 1984 he became Jean Paul Gaultier‚Äôs design assistant in Paris, a role he held until 1987. In 1988, Martin launched his own self-titled design label Maison Martin Margiela with business partner and fellow designer Jenny Meirens. Initially working out of a Paris apartment, they opened their first store in an unmarked white space in Paris, also opening a small studio on 12 Leopoldstraat in Antwerp. New York Magazine wrote that \\"the designer quickly defined a deconstructed look [with his new label]‚Ä¶ Vaguely Dadaist, as if Marcel Duchamp were reincarnated as a fashion designer, Margiela questioned every tenet of fashion and luxury.\\" Vogue would later write that his early ideas \\"provoked shock and intrigue\\" in the fashion industry. On the label's garments, simple blank white labels with four white tacks were sewn to signify the brand. Distinct product ranges were given numbers as signifiers, in no particular chronological order. Early shows and anonymity With New York Magazine describing the label's early shows as \\"perhaps more like art happenings than the thematic and operatic productions ‚Äò80s Paris fashion is known for,\\" in 1988, Maison Martin Margiela presented its debut womenswear collection in Paris. for the spring of 1989. Refusing to take bows at his live shows, Margiela began avoiding pictures and began handling all media via fax, with interviews taken collectively by the entire design team and correspondence signed with \\"we.\\" Many in the fashion media contended that the anonymity was a publicity stunt, although Maison Martin Margiela asserted that Margiela's anonymity was a reaction to an overly commercialized fashion industry and a genuine attempt to return the focus of fashion to the clothing, and not the personas behind it. The press dubbed Margiela the Greta Garbo of fashion as a result, a reference to Garbo's similar avoidance of the spotlight, and in 2008 the New York Times called Margiela \\"fashion's invisible man.\\" Purchase by OTB In 1994 the New York Times commented on the company's influence by writing that its \\"made-over flea-market clothes put an end to the conspicuous consumption [of the fashion industry] of the 1980s.\\" That year Maison Martin Margiela debuted its first period pieces. In 1998, Maison Martin Margiela debuted a menswear collection, known as line 10. Maison Martin Margiela oversaw creative direction of womenswear for the French design house Herm√®s from 1997 until 2003, with the design team working under Herm√®s chairman Jean- Louis Dumas. After going public in 2002, the majority of Maison Martin Margiela's shares were purchased by the OTB Group, a holding company led by Renzo Rosso, also owner of the Italian fashion label Diesel. In December 2004, Maison Martin Margiela moved into a new headquarters in an eighteenth-century convent in Paris' 11th arrondissement. The interior of the headquarters and furniture were painted entirely white with emulsion, creating an aged look. In addition to the white surroundings, employees all wear \\"blouse blanche\\", white coats traditionally worn by couture craftsmen. The white coats are both a nod to history and aesthetics, as well as an equalizer, as all employees wear them, regardless of title. By the summer of 2008 there were 14 Margiela boutiques. New design team and collections In October 2009, it was announced that Martin Margiela had resigned as creative director of Maison Martin Margiela, to varied speculation about the reasons. Following Margiela's departure, the anonymous design team continued to design the label, with no single creative director in place. CEO Giovanni Pungetti stated that \\"we want to stay avant-garde, and provocative, but without a new creative director. It‚Äôs a challenge. We know this. We will probably make mistakes, but the most important thing is to learn from them.\\" The company expanded its homewares and interior design business in 2010, and in July 2011 the house designed several concept hotel suites for La Maison Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris. By the fall of 2014, sources estimated that the brand generated about $126 million in annual revenues, with around 50 directly owned stores. In October 2014 it was announced that John Galliano would take the position of creative director, after having previously served in that position at Givenchy, Dior, and his eponymous line, John Galliano. As reported by the Guardian, Margiela's only directions to the new director were \\"make it your own.\\" Giving rare interviews in the interim, Galliano presented his debut collection for Maison Margiela in January 2015, to broadly positive reviews. Coinciding with Galliano's debut collection, it was revealed that the house had dropped \\"Martin\\" from its name, in favor of \\"Maison Margiela.\\" A spokesperson for Maison Margiela said that the name change \\"represented an evolution of the house.\\" With Galliano focusing on the haute couture element of the company, by the end of 2015 revenues were up 30%. Stores A Maison Martin Margiela store in Paris, France, 2012 Prior to the brand's acquisition by OTB Group in 2002, its stores were not listed in the phone directory, and Margiela's name did not appear outside the shops. By the summer of 2008 there were 14 Margiela boutiques operating internationally, with expansion in Dubai, Hong Kong, Moscow and Munich taking place over the subsequent six months. In late 2009 the brand opened a \\"pop-up store\\" at the Art Basel Miami Beach art fair. The number of standalone stores had grown to 17 by 2010, with 21 \\"shop-in-shops\\" internationally. As of 2017, Maison Margiela has stores in countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States, and Thailand. Products Maison Margiela assigns each of its product ranges a number from 0 to 23 as a reference code, with no particular chronological order. Examples include fine jewelry (12), footwear (22), eyewear (8), objects (13) and fragrance (3). The house produces both artisanal collections and ready-to-wear collections, with the former inspiring the designs of the latter. With formal allegiance to no particular fashion movement, Maison Margiela's designs are famous for deconstructionist traits such as exposed seams, being oversized and upcycling garments. Other deconstructionist tactics Maison Margiela has utilized include using traditional fabric linings as the outer layers of garments, and the label's 1988 debut womenswear collection included what The Independent described as \\"a leather butcher's apron reworked into a seductive evening gown,\\" and an old tulle dress worked into several tailored jackets. Other work with unconventional materials has included clothes fashioned of plastic carrier bags and wire coat hangers, trouser suits made from 1970s upholstery fabrics, tops made with leather gloves, and jewelry made of colored ice such that clothes are dyed as the jewelry melts. Trompe l'oeil print jersey dresses by Maison Martin Margiela, Spring/Summer 1996 (left) and 2012 H&M; reissue (right) First shown in 1989 and introduced in 1992, one of the company's more recognized pieces is the Tabi boot, an interpretation of the traditional split Japanese tabi sock which separates the large toe. In 1994 Maison Margiela debuted its first period pieces, with a line of \\"complete reproductions,\\" after building its previous collection entirely from its archives. Maison Margiela debuted a menswear collection in 1998, known as line 10. Martin Margiela was creative director for womenswear of the French design house Herm√®s from 1997 until 2003, with the Maison Martin Margiela team's designs for Herm√®s unveiled twice a year in Hermes‚Äô rue St-Honor√© store. The Independent called the collections \\"understated,\\" with both \\"loose-fitting masculine tailoring\\" and \\"black cr√™pe evening dresses,\\" among other items. New York MAgazine in turn described the designs as \\"quiet explorations of luxury that focused on classic clothes with subtle but masterful twists.\\" Maison Martin Margiela debuted its first haute couture collection in 2006. In November 2008 the brand launched a small jewelry and eyewear collection including its first pair of sunglasses, described as \\"an impenetrable black band that wraps right around the face.\\" The house's first fragrance was created in collaboration with L‚ÄôOreal, debuting in 2009. Maison Margiela debuted a capsule collection for H&M; in 2012, consisting largely of reissued pieces from the Margiela archives. The company collaborated with Converse on shoe designs in 2013, and has also worked with the watch brand G-Shock and collaborated with Swarovski on ready-to-wear jewelry in 2013. On 26 September 2018, after the spring/summer 2019 show, Maison Margiela's new fragrance, Mutiny was launched. Nose Dominique Ropion took six years to come up with a fragrance that reflects Galliano's vision of the Maison Margiela women. Willow Smith, Teddy Quinlivan, Hanne Gaby Odiele, Sasha Lane, Princess Nokia and Molly Bair are the chosen ‚ÄúMutinist‚Äù ambassadors, who will be representing the diversity and individuality of the fragrance. Live shows Maison Margiela is known for showcasing collections in atypical settings and manners, with The New York Times describing the shows as \\"alternately electrifying or humorous or sexy or just plain weird.\\" According to New York Magazine, early shows were \\"perhaps more like art happenings than the thematic and operatic productions ‚Äò80s Paris fashion is known for,\\" as well as \\"radically personal and humanistic expressions about clothes [at a time] when fashion otherwise seemed estranged from everyday realities.\\" Maison Margiela's runway shows are notable in that the models' faces are often obscured by hoods, fabric or long hair, in an attempt to direct attention to the clothes and away from the models themselves. In 1989 Maison Margiela staged a collection on a playground in the outskirts of Paris. With local children interacting with the models in an unrehearsed way and a first-come, first-served seating arrangement, according to Business of Fashion, \\"the critics loathed it. The industry loved it.\\" Continuing to stage catwalks in unusual places, in spring 1992 a show in an abandoned Paris metro station featured models walking down staircases lined with candles, and according to The Independent, other settings have included round dining tables arranged in neglected warehouses, stairwells of old town houses, and disused subway cars. Although the house has a reputation for avoiding booking celebrity models, for spring of 1993 models such as Cecilia Chancellor and Kate Moss showcased \\"minimalism paired with Victoriana.\\" 1993 also saw a show with models weaving among a brass band on the runway, and in 1994 the label staged a collection based on what Barbie‚Äôs wardrobe would look like full size. Models sat amongst the audience in 1995, and on another occasion, in 1997 the company used a map to invite the fashion press to a street corner in France, and then had the models and a Belgian brass band showcase the newest collection after disembarking from a Routemaster bus. Vogue also related that \\"one show challenged editors and buyers to seat themselves according to their perceived importance, while another saw models wheeled out on trolleys.\\" According to Vogue, for two seasons in 1998 the label made do without live models, in one case instead using marionettes by Jane How. Kanye West wearing a mask and wardrobe by Maison Margiela on his 2013 Yeezus tour Maison Martin Margiela was invited to show their first haute couture collection in Paris by The Chamber Syndicale in May 2006. The house then held its 20th anniversary show in September 2008 in Paris, featuring a catwalk with a walking birthday cake and \\"an oom-pah band surrounded by Margiela's lab-coated assistants.\\" Clothing was described as \\"coats made of synthetic wigs, bodysuits that fused parts of trench coats and tuxedo jackets, and mirrored tights made to look like disco balls.\\" The house designed Kanye West‚Äôs tour wardrobe in 2013 for his Yeezus tour. The spring show of 2014 \\"melded sweet, pioneer styles like floral house dresses with edgier fare like nude bodysuits and oversize Willy Wonka sunglasses.\\" In early 2015 the house premiered its first two collections with Galliano as head designer, initially the brand's \\"artisanal\\" collection. The second collection comprised 30 outfits including neon accessors, \\"Mary-Jane shoes and fake-fur slippers, short skirts, long coats, patent finishes.\\" Galliano upheld house tradition by not taking a post-show bow, although he was in attendance at the shows. The July 2016 show by the house featured items such as military coats, a parachute dress, neon face paint, and 19th-century garments. In September 2016, Maison Margiela partnered with Barneys New York for its fall windows on Madison Avenue, creating four vignettes to reflect the house's recent artisans and ready-to-wear collections. Retrospectives and exhibits The Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp (MoMu) held a retrospective on the label's work in 2008, moving the exhibit to Somerset House in London two years later. In 2017, MoMu showcased the 12 collections the label had produced while Margiela was appointed by Jean-Louis Dumas to work with Herm√®s.  Documentaries  In early 2015 filmmaker Alison Chernick released The Artist is Absent, a short biopic on Martin Margiela that launched at the Tribeca Film Festival. In November 2019, director Reiner Holzemer premiered the documentary 'Martin Margiela: In His Own Words'. Co-produced by Aminata and Holzemer (who had previously worked on a documentary by Dries Van Noten), it was called \\"the definitive study of this elusive, technically gifted designer \\" in Hollywood Reporter. He notably explained his withdrawal from the public eye and his desire to remain a designer, rather than \\"a creative director who directs his assistants\\". Typically, he is not shown on-screen.

All three served in Napoleon's Italian navy. After captured her at the Brionian Islands, the Royal Navy took Ortensia into service as HMS Ortenzia. The Navy sold her at Malta in 1812. Capture On the morning of 16 July 1808, Captain John Holligsworth of Minstrel was off Veruda, when he observed a schooner anchor off \\"Paul's\\". As Minstrel approached, the crew of the schooner fired her guns at Minstrel and then ran schooner ashore \\"on one of the Bryone Islands\\", where they abandoned her. The schooner turned out to be the Italian schooner Ortenzia, pierced for 16 guns but carrying only ten. She had had a crew of 56 men under the command of lieutenant de fregate Stalamini. Hollingsworth opined that she would be useful in His Majesty's service as she was a \\"very fast sailing Vessel... Copper bottomed, nearly new\\". Royal Navy service The Royal Navy commissioned her in 1809 under the command of Lieutenant Edward Blaquiere. On 22 June 1810 Ortenzia was off the coast of Calabria. When , Commander John Toup Nicholas, arrived, Blaquiere informed Toup that a French convoy of 51 vessels were anchored off Cirella, a small town some 30 miles south of the Gulf of Policastro. The next day Pilot and Ortenzia came up under sweeps, the wind being calm, and observed that the convoy was under the escort of five settees and eight gunboats. Ortensia, assisted by boats from Pilot chased the convoy, firing on it. The British succeeded in causing five of the largest merchant vessels to run ashore north of the town and some of the others to seek refuge under a battery. However, the arrival of more escorts and the tiredness of the British sailors, who had been at the sweeps for nine hours, led Toup to call off the attack. In the evening Pilots boats tried to destroy the vessels on the beach, but heavy small arms fire drove them off. Pilot and Ortenzia then destroyed the vessels with gunfire. British casualties included three men killed.Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, pp.56-7.

She lives and works in San Francisco. Gonzalez is a co-founder of the publishing house, Reflection Press. She also co-created an online learning environment called School of the Free Mind. Gonzalez has a unique, \\"high queer femme\\" sense of personal style that includes piercings and multiple tattoos. Gonzalez's art and work are focused on helping others build a sense of self and connection to others and the environment, despite differences between individuals. Her illustrations and books have helped increase \\"acceptance of, and love for, children's books by and about Latinos.\\" Her art is featured on the cover of a textbook, Contemporary Chicana and Chicano Art: Artists, Works, Culture, and Education, Volume II. Gonzalez teaches and presents workshops around the United States.  Biography  Gonz√°lez was born in Lancaster, California into a biracial home: her mother was German and her father Mexican. Gonzalez has one brother, a year younger than her. When Gonzalez was seven, she had an accident which caused her to be a coma for three days. After recovering, she found gifts waiting for her, including a pad of paper and colored pencils. This early gift inspired her to start drawing and introduced her to how art can help heal. In addition to art supplies, she was also taken to classes at a local craft store in order to help her recover fully. For several years, Gonzalez was \\"deeply Catholic\\" and used the family Bible and Michelangelo as a drawing source and inspiration. At age thirteen, Gonzalez and her family moved to rural Oregon where she experienced racism and homophobia. In Oregon, she was considered \\"exotic\\" and called a \\"mulatto.\\" Gonzalez didn't intend to become an artist for a living and has little formal art training. She changed her mind about art after studying creative writing at the University of Oregon. While she enjoyed poetry, she found the departments culture to be very focused on white- male experiences and the language and topics used to be ‚Äúexclusive and hierarchical.‚Äù Gonzalez decided that art was a more \\"inclusive and complicated\\" way for her to express herself. She was drawn to art because it was more accessible than writing and she could be less explicit with her imagery. This is when she began painting. Gonzalez was prompted to move from Oregon to San Francisco after she was shot at while living in a lesbian wilderness community. She also found that she would be better able to pursue her artistic dreams in San Francisco where she still lives today. Gonzalez has become estranged from her parents who disowned her when she came out at age 20 as part of the LGBT community At that time she became very involved with the LGBTQIA+ community and the politics surrounding them. After leaving school with only a few art classes taken, Gonzalez explored creating her own art. At this time, Gonzales was interested in exploring the nature of \\"reality, consciousness and how these relate to creativity\\" and was very influenced by Jane Roberts' channeling of another consciousness that Roberts referred to as Seth. Harriet Rohmer, the original founder of Children‚Äôs Book Press (now an imprint of Lee&Low; Books). Harriet asked if she would be interested in illustrating children's books which is ultimately what lead Gonzal to her passion for illustrating. Gonzalez said it felt as if she had ‚Äúcome home.‚Äù In 1996, Gonzalez suffered from a toxic dose of chemicals in a print-making accident. The accident caused her to be incapacitated for three years and very sick for ten more. During her illness, she traveled out of the United States for the first time, going to India and visiting the city of Varanasi, which she considered a sacred place. She also went to Brazil to work with Ayauasca, a \\"plant teacher.\\" Ayauasca identified Gonzalez's illness as heavy metal poisoning in 2003 and eventually began to receive treatment in various forms. After her health returned, Gonzalez began to create more art, and also received a grant from the San Francisco Arts Commission to create a series, Healing Through. The series what completes and shown in 2008/09, around the same time she wrote her first book, My Colors, My World. Gonz√°lez has two children and is married to Reflection Press co-founder, Matthew. Reflection Press focuses on children's book that are considered \\"radical and revolutionary.\\" She says that \\"the freaks and geeks need to tell their stories and kids need to hear them and relate to them,\\" and that major, established publishing houses won't publish those kinds of books. Of her family, Gonzalez says that her domestic life is such that the \\"dominant culture\\" would have \\"absolutely no ideas what to do with somebody like me...I'm in line with my beliefs and completely out of line with the beliefs of the dominant culture.\\"  Work  Gonzalez's art depicts non-stereotypical images of people, including overweight individuals and empowered women. She often includes a chimeric sense of nepantla in her art, depicting human-like figures who are not completely part of any category or world. Her portraits and self-portraits are \\"hybridized,\\" redefining women using \\"elements drawn from Mexican history.\\" Her figures are considered \\"sensuously curvaceous.\\" Gonzalez's art also shows a connection of the individual to the environment. Gonz√°lez was influenced by the work of Frida Kahlo, and reinterprets that artist's life through use of her image and artistic legacy. Gonzalez uses many different techniques to create her art, including \\"acrylics, collage, cut paper, photography, pastels and charcoal.\\" Gonzalez feels that creating art is a spiritual process. Her work often draws from many sources of mythology, like the Aztecs, and traditional spiritual icons like the Virgin of Guadalupe. Other sources of inspiration include pop culture and her own imagination. Her paintings combine her inspirations to \\"work out impulses with culled, blended imagery.\\" For some time after her illness, Gonzalez worked with a more limited pallet. Gonz√°lez was inspired to illustrate after meeting Harriet Rohmer, the founder of Children's Book Press. She has illustrated over twenty books and written some on her own. Gonzalez considers it very important as a child to see oneself depicted in books. Gonzalez wants children to know that they belong by using her illustrations to create inclusive books. She wants to illustrate difficult situations and feelings for children, so that they feel less \\"alone.\\" Her illustrations for children include individuals who are not seen as often in books, such as gay characters and overweight characters. For illustrations in Francisco X. Alarcon's stories, Gonzalez had to fight to keep the image of an overweight boy who was meant to mirror Alarcon himself. Gonzalez also hides \\"secret\\" images in her illustrations. Gonzalez hid her first secret image in her illustrations for Laughing Tomatoes. Her first written and illustrated children's book was My Colors, My World. Environmental concerns are important in Gonzalez's work. She has been praised for her raising awareness of the environment with young people. I Know the River Loves Me/Yo Que El Rio Me Ama (2009), depicts a Chicana girl visiting a river. As she spends more time exploring, the sepia-tones of the illustrations give way to more and more color. The book was considered a \\"beautiful story.\\" I Know the River Loves Me is about \\"belonging to the world\\" and having a \\"relationship with nature.\\" Gonzalez feels that such relationships with the environment are \\"a very Chicano experience.\\" Call Me Tree: Ll√°mame √°rbol, was described as \\"vibrantly hued\\" and a \\"good choice for story hour dramatizations.\\" It is also significant in not using any gendered pronouns in the story. Call Me Tree was included in the \\"prestigious\\" list curated by Kirkus Reviews, \\"Best Children's Books of 2014.\\" Her writing for Call Me Tree was also praised by Kirkus Reviews, saying that Gonzalez \\"excels at using few words to evoke grand imagery.\\" Gonz√°lez also creates activity books, many of which go along with the curriculum of the School of the Free Mind. Her activity books cover topics that are not often discussed in schools or at home, such as understanding gender. The activity book, Gender Now (2010), explores how there are \\"multiple levels of gender expression.\\" It was also the first book for children to \\"explore transgender topics\\" and intersex topics.

The company was co-founded in 2014 by Marc Lore (who had previously sold Diapers.com to Amazon.com), along with Mike Hanrahan and Nate Faust. Jet.com raised $820 million over four venture rounds from GV, Goldman Sachs, Bain Capital Ventures, Accel Partners, Alibaba Group, and Fidelity. The website was formally launched in July 2015. In Fall 2016, it became a subsidiary of Walmart. In June 2019, in the wake of slumping sales through the Jet.com site in the period since the acquisition, the majority of Jet.com employees were transferred to work on the Walmart.com site and Simon Belsham, the president of Jet.com, stepped down. On May 19, 2020, Walmart announced that it was shutting down Jet.com, which they later did without warning on June 4, directing visitors to use Walmart.com instead. History After Marc Lore sold Diapers.com to Amazon in November 2010, he speculated that users may be willing to accept longer wait times on obtaining online-purchased goods if they can save money on their purchases. He said that existing Internet retailers were catering only to wealthier customers \\"who care more about convenience than value\\". Lore initially set out to create a site that would use a fee-based membership model like Costco and Sam's Club and combine this with the broad selection of a general e-commerce retailer, somewhat like Amazon Prime but emphasizing reduced product prices for members rather than fast free shipping. He began to peddle the idea, and after lunch with a partner at Accel Ventures, Lore was promised $1 million in seed capital to start a new site. To create transparency and reduce squabbling over salaries, Lore created a 10-tier salary and title system. Recruits were assigned to one of the levels based on experience, thus eliminating salary negotiations. A prominent feature of the site is its pricing scheme. Pricing adjustments are offered to encourage users to buy more items at once and to purchase items that are located in the same distribution center, thus making the purchases less expensive for the company to collect and ship. As users add items to their virtual shopping cart, they are encouraged to select additional items using pricing incentives. Pricing options are also offered during the check- out process, such as having the user opt out of the ability to return merchandise for free in exchange for a reduced price. It was initially announced that the site would charge users a $50 annual membership fee after a 90-day free trial period, and that the membership fee would be the only source of profit for the company ‚Äì so the merchandise would be sold at break-even prices by Jet.com. Lore said \\"The bottom line is, we're basically not making a dime on any of the transactions. We're passing it all back to the consumer.\\" It was also announced that the site was planned to primarily function as a marketplace for members to access offerings from third-party merchant partners rather than having Jet.com selling goods itself directly. The site was launched with an initiative called Jet Insider, which was a campaign to spread the word about the company before its official public launch. Users who signed up were offered six months of site membership for free and a link to use to refer friends and family to sign up. Referrers were given prizes such as lifetime memberships or five year memberships, and the top 10 referrers were given stock options. By February 2015, about 352,000 users had signed up and the early membership program was closed. Beta testers reported mixed reviews on the site's benefits. As of July 2015, the site had 4.5 million products available for sale. After the beta period, the site was officially launched on July 21, 2015. The plan to use a fee-based membership model was dropped in October 2015. In November 2015, Jet.com was rumored to be raising $500 million, but ended up raising $350 million in venture capital led by Fidelity. In May 2016, Jet.com was reported to have been valued at $1.3 billion in its latest funding round and had launched a pilot program for a grocery delivery service similar to AmazonFresh. However, the site was also reported to be \\"bleeding money\\". In August 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that Walmart was in talks with jet.com to acquire the company. It was announced on August 8, 2016, that Walmart would acquire Jet.com for $3.3 billion ($3 billion in cash and up to $300 million in stock paid out over time to the founders and other selected individuals at the company). In December 2016, Jet.com completed the acquisition of ShoeBuy from IAC. ShoeBuy was re-branded as Shoes.com shortly after the acquisition closed. Features One of core features of Jet was the \\"realtime pricing algorithm\\", which, according to cofounder Marc Lore, aimed to gauge \\"the true marginal cost of getting that product to [customers]\\". Items were priced based on their locations in distribution centers. If, for example, a user purchased several items that were all located in the same distribution center, their price would be lower than if they are located in separate centers. If the user waived their right to return an item, the item decreased in price. Paying by a less expensive form of payment, for example by using a debit card rather than a credit card, would also decrease the price. The site was also linked with partner sites such as TigerDirect.com and the Sony Store. Jet Anywhere was a program that allowed Jet users to spend money at other venues and earn \\"JetCash\\", which could be spent on the actual Jet site. Partner sites in the program included Ann Taylor, Bloomingdale's, Hotels.com, and Nike. Jet Anywhere was ended in March 2017. Jet ran into some backlash in August 2015 after displaying some links to other websites as if they were partnering sites, when in fact they were not. Businesses such as Macy's, Walmart, and Home Depot detached themselves from Jet because of the incident. Jet removed all the links to sites of businesses that requested removal. Jet's chief customer officer stated that the businesses that wished to be removed viewed Jet as a competitor. Business model Prices were generated by the pricing algorithm that adjusted the price of the contents in the cart based on distribution centers the items come from. The Wall Street Journal reported in July 2015 that in a test purchase on the site, Jet had sold the newspaper 12 items for $275.55 that had cost the site $518.46 ‚Äì losing $242.91 on the transaction. The Jet Partner program allowed companies to sell their products on Jet's site by registering for an account and integrating application programming interface (API) components into their systems.

It was first broadcast on 29 April 2015 on BBC Two. The episode was written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, and directed by Dan Zeff. It stars Pemberton, Shearsmith, Alison Steadman, Alice Lowe, Sophie McShera, Dan Starkey, Cariad Lloyd and Caden-Ellis Wall. The episode begins with Tina (McShera) arriving at a Victorian villa for a s√©ance. Hives (Shearsmith) sits her at a table and then escorts the ominous, shrouded Madam Talbot (Steadman) into the room. Like \\"The Harrowing\\", the final episode of the first series of Inside No. 9, \\"S√©ance Time\\" is somewhat more horrific than is typical for the programme, though humour remains. In writing the episode, Pemberton and Shearsmith began with the idea of a s√©ance, and developed the plot from there. The theme was one that they had wanted to address for some time, though they wanted to approach it in an original way. The writers aimed to begin \\"S√©ance Time\\" with minimal humour, presenting it as straight horror, before introducing the first twist. The episode explores both the norms of horror films and the unpleasantness of actors and the television industry. Critics responded positively to \\"S√©ance Time\\", praising the horror‚Äîseveral considered the episode genuinely frightening‚Äîthe humour, and the writing. Steadman's performance was singled out as strong, with critics commending her character as a highlight. Production Inspiration and writing The second series of Inside No. 9 was written in 2014 by the programme's creators Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. The idea for \\"S√©ance Time\\" began with the \\"trigger\\" of a s√©ance, and the plot grew out of this, while the episode's title was taken from a line performed by David Warner in the film From Beyond the Grave.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 0:50. Shearsmith had previously taken part in a s√©ance with The League of Gentlemen in a putatively-haunted house. He had heard tapping and seen movement on a ouija board, and believed he had experienced something supernatural until Mark Gatiss confessed that he was responsible. Shearsmith said that he and Pemberton had always wanted to do a s√©ance-inspired story, but had never been able to find a new angle from which to approach the theme. \\"S√©ance Time\\", he thought, \\"felt a bit different\\" to how s√©ances had previously been portrayed. The writers were unsure how to conclude the episode, and considered 15 to 20 different endings before settling on the one they used.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 10:20. The title of \\"S√©ance Time\\" was inspired by the line \\"It's s√©ance time!\\", spoken by David Warner's character in the 1974 film From Beyond the Grave. Casting and characters As each episode of Inside No. 9 features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. \\"S√©ance Time\\" starred Sophie McShera as Tina‚Äîthough Tina was played by an uncredited extra in the opening shot of a house's exteriorPemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 0:20.‚ÄîShearsmith as \\"Hives\\"/Terry, Alison Steadman as \\"Madam Talbot\\"/Anne, Dan Starkey as \\"Blue Demon Dwarf\\"/Clive, Cariad Lloyd as Gemma, Alice Lowe as Amanda, Pemberton as Pete and Caden-Ellis Wall as William. The writers felt the episode featured a number of good roles for women.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 8:50. Members of Inside No. 9 crew, include the episode's third assistant director Saloum N'Jie, appeared as uncredited extras playing members of a television crew.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 9:10. Though there were only a small production crew seen in the episode, this mirrors real crews of the kind featured.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 10:00. Shearsmith had previously worked with Steadman on Agatha Christie's Marple, while she and Pemberton had met, though the pair had not worked together.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 11:45. She was ill upon arrival for filming, which led to Pemberton worrying that production would have to be suspended. As a result of Steadman's illness, her character's croaking voice was mostly her own.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 6:25. One journalist commented on the appropriateness of the casting, given the influence of Abigail's Party‚Äîin which Steadman starred‚Äîon \\"Nana's Party\\", the previous week's episode. The actor was one of a number (the others being Jane Horrocks and Claire Skinner) who appeared in Inside No. 9 second series who had also starred in Life Is Sweet. During filming, Steadman expressed happiness to be working with Pemberton and Shearsmith. She explained that they are excellent writers as they are \\"off the wall\\". Pemberton knew McShera through his friend Siobhan Finneran, who co-starred with McShera in Downton Abbey. He felt that McShera would be able to bring a \\"mousey quality\\" to the role of Tina. Shearsmith felt that her performance was funny while retaining realism.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 1:40. The writers found the role of \\"Blue Demon Dwarf\\" difficult to cast, but were very happy with the performance of Starkey,Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 8:40. who kept some of his character's props.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 12:30. The writers also praised Lowe, who they felt was able to make a lot of a comparatively small part. The character of Amanda, they said, was to seem bored and aloof, attempting to get away with doing as little work as possible, while also favouring people seen as more important.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 12:50. The name Hives, used by Shearsmith's character, was taken from a Laurel and Hardy butler of the same name.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 3:25. Meanwhile, Hives's costume and mannerisms were inspired by those worn and adopted by Noel Edmonds in undercover practical jokes.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 3:50. A related influence for the episode was a prank-gone-wrong seen on YouTube, in which a joke's target punches a costumed person when the latter surprises the former.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 5:50. Pemberton's character spoke with a cockney accent, something unusual for Pemberton, who normally does not affect accents when acting.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 16:40. In addition to playing Pete, Pemberton provided the deep voice spoken by \\"Madam Talbot\\" during the s√©ance.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 17:40. Style Shearsmith (pictured, 2003), as well as co-writing the episode, starred as \\"Hives\\"/Terry. Shearsmith said that he and Pemberton sometimes aim to produce episodes with genuinely scary scenes, comparing \\"S√©ance Time\\" to \\"The Harrowing\\", the sixth episode of Inside No. 9 first series, which was also particularly horrific. He said that the writers and crew had similar aims in terms of atmosphere in \\"S√©ance Time\\" as they had in \\"The Harrowing\\". The episodes also shared similar openings, with a lone woman walking towards a large house. Thematically, Shearsmith felt that the episode served to tie together a number of ideas with which he had been \\"obsessed\\" for years, including horror, ghosts and magic. The episode's director, Dan Zeff, got behind the idea of genuine horror, and Shearsmith was happy with how the initial s√©ance was portrayed. A large number of horror clich√©s were used, but the reason that these clich√©s are present is subsequently revealed.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 9:25. Props utilised to heighten the horror included a trick candle‚Äîswapped back- and-forth with a real one‚Äîwhich could shoot a large flame. This was operated by a technician hiding under the table on which it was placed.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 17:10. A doll seen on screen, the writers claimed, was probably visible only to Terry among the characters.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 17:50. For the white eyes of \\"Madam Talbot\\", Steadman wore partially white contact lenses. Had she worn fully white lenses, she would have been unable to see, and this would have led to more work for the production crew. Instead, her partially white eyes were made fully white in post-production.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 6:50. Also added in post-production was the wetness of Terry's clothes in the final scene.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 28:00. The writers hoped to fool viewers into thinking that they were doing a straightforward s√©ance episode, and so there is little humour prior to the episode's first twist.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 2:50. For Steadman, the writing meant that both the audience and the character of Tina are fooled together. Nonetheless, humour remained elsewhere in the script; Lloyd looked forward to performing a particular joke involving blue paint. Terry refers to his colleagues variously as \\"Pepe and His Friends\\", a reference to a variety act with a similar name,Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 14:35. and a \\"warm prop\\", a disparaging name which, according to the writers, has been used in the film industry to refer to extras. Filming and release Inside No. 9 second series was filmed from the end of 2014 into early 2015. \\"S√©ance Time\\" was the second episode of the second series to be filmed, and the filming was completed shortly before production ceased for a Christmas break. The episode was filmed at Langleybury, a country house in Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire. The same house was used for \\"The Harrowing\\", as well as in Shearsmith and Pemberton's pre-Inside No. 9 television series Psychoville. On its first showing on BBC Two, \\"S√©ance Time\\" was moved from Inside No. 9 usual slot on a Thursday evening. It was instead shown on Wednesday 29 April; this showing was at 10pm in most of the UK, and at 11.20pm in Northern Ireland. The freelance journalist Dan Owen suggested that this, combined with their refusal to release the series on Blu-ray, suggested that the BBC had little faith in Inside No. 9. He nonetheless called for a third series, a request echoed by other commentators. In their commentary on the episode, Pemberton said that he and Shearsmith had plans for a potential third series, and hoped to be able to get on with producing it.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 27:00. \\"S√©ance Time\\", along with the other episodes from the second series, was released on DVD on 5 May 2016, and a third series was announced in October of that year. Plot Tina (McShera) arrives at a Victorian villa for a s√©ance. Hives (Shearsmith) settles Tina before retrieving Talbot (Steadman), who arrives shrouded in black and carrying a doll. Talbot, an elderly woman with heavy cataracts, speaks in a high-pitched voice, unnerving Tina. When the s√©ance begins, objects fly around the room, Talbot's voice becomes demonic and ectoplasm seeps from her mouth. Hives encourages Tina not to break the circle, but she does so when a blue- faced demon (Starkey) appears behind her. She is terrified until Hives reveals himself to be Terry, the host of a hidden camera programme called Scaredy Cam. Scaredy Cam production crew, including the director Gemma (Lloyd) and the make-up artist Amanda (Lowe), enter to prepare for the next prank. \\"Talbot\\" is being played by the demanding stage actress Anne, but the other crew are unable to remember the name of the extra (who they falsely believe to be a dwarf) playing \\"Blue Demon Dwarf\\". They mostly ignore him, despite his eagerness to talk about his acting experiences and his requests for a drink. Terry is irritable and impatient, unwilling to talk to Tina or Gemma about a prank with him dressed up as a gorilla. This prank led to a young boy wetting himself and a previous cancellation of Scaredy Cam. The programme is due to return on a different channel, and Terry has chosen a different prank to be announced as the winner of a \\"public\\" vote for the programme's best. The extra confronts Terry about the fact he was originally cast as \\"Spirit of Little Boy\\", but Terry does not care, and the extra is sent back into a chest to wait for the next member of the public. Pete (Pemberton), a new mark, enters, but the prank does not work as well as with Tina. Among other problems, Pete swears too much and does not seem affected by the atmosphere, while cues are missed by the pranksters. Terry is surprised to hear a child's voice during Anne's performance as Madam Talbot, and, backstage, the camera stream is blurry. When \\"Blue Demon Dwarf\\" appears, Pete punches him, and the production crew rush in. The extra drifts in and out of consciousness before Gemma‚Äîhaving covered her face in blue paint after giving mouth-to-mouth‚Äîsays he has died. Backstage, people wait for the police and ambulance; Terry is worried about his career, Anne wants to get away for some food and Amanda is keen to retrieve props from the corpse, but Pete and Gemma show some remorse. When alone, Terry looks to the camera feed and sees the extra standing in the s√©ance room, and, relieved, runs to see him. Facing away from Terry and speaking in a rasping voice, the figure introduces himself as \\"Spirit of Little Boy\\", and talks of a suicide after the embarrassment of wetting himself on television. After speaking to the \\"boy\\", Terry believes that he himself is on Scaredy Cam, but no one is watching from backstage. When he touches the figure, the extra collapses, but a child's voice continues to shout. A corpse- like child (Wall) begins to rise from the cot used for Madam Talbot's doll. Backstage, Gemma and a police officer look for Terry. They find him in the s√©ance room; he has wet himself, and insists that he is on Scaredy Cam. The child's face appears on the camera feed. Analysis \\"S√©ance Time\\" draws inspiration from horror films and \\"the pretensions of actors\\"‚Äîtwo themes favoured by the writers. Horror tropes noted by journalists include the Insidious-inspired arrival of \\"Blue Demon Dwarf\\" and Madam Talbot's demonic voice, reminiscent of a similar voice in The Exorcist. For one critic, Pete's initial failure to believe the prank results in a memorable sequence that \\"was a lovely statement about how old-fashioned horror imagery and well-worn tropes can be terrifying in the right hands, and plain ludicrous if you refuse to enter into the spirit of things\\". Though the episode begins with horror, similar to \\"The Harrowing\\", it quickly moves into the more meta subject of television production; something \\"more intimidating and probably a lot crueller\\" than the supernatural. For the television critic Matt Baylis, the episode is a criticism of the callousness of reality television (such as Candid Camera) from the perspective of television plays. The horror at the start of the episode, he argues, continues even once the ruse is revealed. \\"Ugliness\\" remains in Terry's arrogance, Anne's self-obsession and the indifference of Gemma and Amanda. This builds gradually into a \\"moral horror\\" in which \\"the unkind got their desserts\\". Phoebe-Jane Boyd, writing for the entertainment website Den of Geek, compared the television crew to individuals pulled out of the \\"Summerland\\" of cancelled television. Terry is \\"parasitic and dead of heart\\", an example of a particular brand of \\"washed-up middle-aged television presenters\\". Amanda is \\"so deadened to the bitchery of the entertainment industry\\" that she is unfazed at the thought of retrieving props from a corpse. Anne behaves in a \\"bitter and narcissistic\\" way. The \\"heartless asides\\" concerning the previous misjudged prank are mirrored by the distaste directed towards Clive. Reception Critics praised the performance of Alison Steadman (pictured, 2006) Critics responded positively to \\"S√©ance Time\\", with a number of them characterising it as genuinely scary. Vicki Power, writing for The Daily Telegraph, described the episode as \\"clever and chilling\\", while Julia Raeside and Victoria Segal, writing for The Sunday Times, called it \\"cleverly executed\\", and Baylis described it as \\"a faith- restorer for those who love\\" television drama. Mark Jones, writing for theguardian.com, called the episode \\"suitably spooky\\" and a \\"fitting end to a second series that has excelled at times\\", and Chris Bennion, writing for The Independent, similarly described it as a \\"brilliant series finale\\". A contrary opinion was offered in a review in the Liverpool Echo; the author called \\"S√©ance Time\\" a \\"decent enough watch\\", but felt that it was \\"a relatively disappointing episode\\" which was \\"unable to match what had gone before\\". Baylis and Bennion stressed that the episode was very scary, with Bennion comparing it to \\"The Harrowing\\"; he was complimentary of both, particularly their respective final scenes. Owen also compared the two, but noted that \\"S√©ance Time\\" contains more humour. Bennion commended the writing, saying that Pemberton and Shearsmith were able to subvert expectations of s√©ances several times; \\"just as you're smugly congratulating yourself for working out every twist and turn, they pull it from your grasp\\". Owen praised the writing and subversion of expectations, and, though he found some of the twists predictable and felt that the ending needed more groundwork, felt that the final sequence \\"was worth it for another brown-trouser moment\\". Bennion felt that the \\"genius\\" of the episode was the way that tension was \\"undercut\\" with humour, but felt that the humour actually served to raise the tension. He highlighted the joke involving blue paint as particularly funny. Patrick Mulkern, of Radio Times, also praised the mix of humour and horror. Raeside and Segal felt that Steadman's performance was the highlight of the episode, and it was also praised in the Liverpool Echo. Bennion said that Steadman \\"[hammed] it up beautifully\\" and \\"[nailed] each [joke] with aplomb\\", also commending the \\"comic turns\\" from Lowe and Lloyd. Mulkern described Steadman's Madam Talbot as \\"hilariously theatrical\\", and Boyd said that Steadman's Anne provided \\"some of the best fun of the episode\\".

He ended the war as SS and Police Leader (SSPF) of Adria-West, Northern Italy. He escaped investigation after the war and is reported to have died when his car overturned on a road outside Dortmund, in August 1953. There were no witnesses to the accident. The police chief at the time of the discovery and identification of the corpse had served under von Alvensleben in Southern Russia during the war. Ludolf \\"Ludi\\" Jakob von Alvensleben was the third of four sons born to Udo von Alvensleben of Wittenmoor, Stendal, Saxony-Anhalt in Germany. His oldest brother, Busso died in 1918, in the First World War. His remaining older brother was the art historian and diarist . His younger brother Wichard von Alvensleben has entered history as being involved in the rescue of a large number of prominent hostages in Tirol in the last days of the Second World War. Like his two older brothers, Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben attended school at the Knights Academy (de) in Brandenburg on the Havel until he volunteered for service in the First World War. After returning from the war as a 19-year-old Lieutenant, he was active in a Freikorps company, before taking over the family estate in Plutowo / Thorn (Polish; Torun) in West Prussia. This was given as an inheritance from his father. As a consequence of the Treaty of Versailles, Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben became one of a large number of Junker members who lost their lands to the Polish state. He was compensated by the new German government. However, he lost this compensation in the hyperinflation that was rampant in Germany in the early 1920s. He was also involved in an unsuccessful Ford auto franchise in the then West-Prussian city of Danzig (Polish; Gda≈Ñsk).Vom K√∂nig zum F√ºhrer: Sozialer Niedergang und politische Radikalisierung ...\\" By Stephan Malinowski, page 561 Financially ruined, Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben returned to Saxony-Anhalt and in June 1932, became an early member of the SS and Adjutant to the SA Gruppenf√ºhrer and later Reichssportf√ºhrer Hans von Tschammer und Osten. He rose rapidly through the ranks. By September 1939 and the invasion of Poland, Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben had become Standartenf√ºhrer. His familial connections to Reichsf√ºhrer Heinrich Himmler's Personal Adjutant, Ludolf Hermann von Alvensleben enabled Standartenf√ºhrer von Alvensleben to be assigned as Inspektionsf√ºhrer for the ethnic paramilitary Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz in West Prussia. He established his headquarters on his dispossessed estate in Plutowo/Thorn (Polish; Torun) and exacted revenge. The cellars of the estate house became the scene for torture and murder of hundreds of Poles and Jews. He reported directly to his namesake and Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz commander Oberf√ºhrer Ludolf Hermann von Alvensleben. The identical name, shared fanaticism and areas of murderous activity, has resulted in the identities of both men being confounded by historians. By the end of October 1939, many of the younger members of the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz in Danzig-West Prussia were incorporated into the Police, SS/SD or Wehrmacht. The Reichsdeutsche Officers were given new duties as ethnic cleansers with the Reichskommisar fur die Festigung des Deutschen Volkstums (RKFDV) and its affiliate organizations. Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben was sent to Lublin to serve under the SS and Police Leader in Lublin, Oberf√ºhrer Odilo Globocnik.

History  The concept of HUMINT Exploitation Teams were first developed in the 1990s; it is not clear exactly when the teams were introduced into the operational environment, but most operational doctrine dates back to 1997. Even though doctrine gives a standard layout of a HET, HETs are very adaptable in terms of organization and being able to adapt to almost any collection environment. HET teams were first heavily implemented by the U.S. Marines, then the U.S. Army in Iraq and Afghanistan. These teams were highly successful because of their capability to be a tactical collection asset as well as a tactical assault team. This gave commanders the ability to not only use the teams for intelligence collection but also for tactical objectives. Before Iraq and Afghanistan, HET teams were mostly used for very sensitive operations in mostly non-combat environments. However, there were very few of these operations compared to the massive number and use of HET teams in Iraq and Afghanistan in the past decade.  Organization and roles of HETs  Both the U.S. Marines and the U.S. Army currently use HET teams, although their versions may differ slightly the basic organization and roles are largely the same. An HET team typically has four to eight members. The size and ratio of the team is largely dependent on what type of operation is going to be carried out by the team, but each member has a dedicated role to play in the team. In each HET team there is a HUMINT Officer/Warrant (35F/351B) or a CI Officer/Warrant (35E/351E), the HUMINT/CI Officer/Warrant is responsible for overall command of the team and planning of all operations. The HUMINT/CI Officer reports directly to the HUMINT Tactical Operations Center(H-TOC) Battle Captain who is typically an O-3/CPT HUMINT/CI(35F/35E) commissioned officer. The Battle Captain receives collection requirements as well as tasking for the HET teams from the S2X who is responsible for all HUMINT/CI assets in the battalion or brigade. Next, there is a team Chief, the team chief is typically a HUMINT(351B) or CI(351E) warrant officer who is responsible for supervising, planning, and coordinating the execution of HUMINT operations. The team chief/operations technician is the technical expert in the team having the greatest level of detail on all intelligence related operations. Next the team has one SSG (E-6) who is either a CI Agent/HUMINT Collector(35L/35M), one SGT (E-5) who is either a CI Agent/HUMINT Collector (35L/35M), and finally two SPCs (E-4) who are either CI Agents/HUMINT Collectors(35L/35M). This combination of intelligence professionals all with their own role enables the team to quickly and efficiently collect on a variety of targets without overstretching capabilities or putting the team in danger. This efficiency and quickness in collection is what has made HET teams so effective in both Iraq and Afghanistan over the last decade as well as making them essential to the targeting of insurgent organizations.  Mission and effectiveness  The HET team's mission is to collect and report timely, accurate, and mission focused information from human sources in order to fulfill tactical, MEF, theater and national level intelligence requirements. The HETs were so effective as a collection asset in Iraq, a Former Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Multi-National Force -West, was quoted as saying \\"The HET teams produced more reporting... than any other intel asset we have out there\\". However, the overall effectiveness of HET teams as well as their success were always very dependent on a complex command and control relationship that extends all the way to the C/J/G/S2X. Although, HET teams were highly effective in collecting, the validity of the information collected by them would sometimes be called into question. As with humans and human error there were errors and inconsistencies in some of the information collected by the HET teams. Even with some errors in the information collected by the HET teams, much of the information collected by them were instrumental in targeting and combating insurgent organizations such as the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. Because of this effectiveness the HET teams were widely implemented and increased in number in Afghanistan.

This particular blowfly is found throughout New Zealand as well as on Chatham, Auckland, Stewart and Campbell Islands that surround New Zealand. Generally blowfly maggots in New Zealand have to feed on animal tissue or faeces to develop into adult blowflies. However the New Zealand blue blowfly larvae can survive on decaying leaves of snow tussock in alpine regions and reach adult maturity without feeding on any animal tissue. Description Immature morphology Blue blowfly carved on pare on display at the New Zealand Arthropod Collection at Landcare Research, Auckland The blue blowfly larvae are made up of a head, three thoracic segments and eight abdominal segments. The head is often so small it is hidden in the thoracic segment it has two lobes, a pair of antennae and also a pair of maxillary palps which are bristle like hairs attached to the mouthparts of the larvae that serve as an additional sensory structure. The mouth is situated at the lower front part of the head and has a pair of hardened mouth hooks. The oral sclerite in the Calliphora quadrimaculata is short compared to other species in the same family. On the first thoracic segment has a pair of spiracles and the rest of the body segments are separated by narrow spines which are very large in the C. quadrimaculata this is seen as a key identifying feature in larval stage. Mature morphology The adult New Zealand blue blowfly is New Zealand‚Äôs largest native blowfly with body lengths of 9.5‚Äì15.0 mm. It has a head, thorax and abdomen and a pair of wings. The head is holoptic in males meaning that the eyes meet on the mid front line of the head and in females the head is dichoptic meaning the two eyes are separated. Eyes are densely haired in both male and female. The thorax has very large orange spiracles which are essentially holes that serve as the insect‚Äôs respiratory system. The thorax is mostly a black except on the scutellum which is the lower part of the thorax on the dorsal side which is a brownish colour. The mesonotum which are middle sclerotized plates on the dorsal surface of the thorax are evenly grey dusted. The bases of the wings are darkened with a brown tinge and the veins are brown. There are six legs the femoral part are blackish brown with a thin grey dusting and the tibiae are a reddish brown. The abdomen is ground colour black with no dusting it has reflections that are metallic violet or blue green in colour.  Distribution  The New Zealand blue blowfly is endemic to New Zealand (only native to New Zealand). It is found throughout New Zealand as well as on Chatham, Auckland, Stewart and Campbell Islands that surround New Zealand. The specimens found on Auckland and Campbell Islands differed slightly from the mainland species by having a blue green metallic instead of a violet metallic on the abdomen.  Habitat preferences  As this species is found throughout New Zealand it can happily live anywhere although it does have a preference for mountain type areas where snow tussock is present in particular in the South Island mountain ranges and Stewart Island. It is also known to be a species that contributes to fly strike in sheep. While it is not a species that initiates fly-strike, it can be a secondary candidate so may be found on farmland areas as well. This particular species is hardly ever found indoors. Life cycle and phenology New Zealand blowflies have a relatively short life cycle essentially the female deposits her eggs in a medium, with C. quadrimaculatathe medium doesn't have to be a decaying carcass it can be decaying leaf matter. After 24 hours the eggs hatch into larvae; there are three growth stages of larval development and during this period the larvae feed on either plant or animal tissues. After a period of eight days the larva stops feeding and leaves the area to develop into a pupa; this can be done under where larvae were feeding or a close distance away approximately 3 cm below in soil where conditions are dry. The larvae empty what contents they have in their stomachs and contract to form pupae. Approximately two weeks after pupa development an adult fly is formed ready to mate. Female blowflies have a pre-egg laying period of 4‚Äì7 days and only live for approximately 2‚Äì3 weeks; in this time around 600‚Äì800 eggs are deposited, in total the whole cycle is about 20‚Äì25 days in length from egg to egg. The New Zealand blue blowfly predominately mates over the summer months, in particular February, because it relies on warmer temperatures for egg to adult development. Diet and foraging New Zealand blue blowflies feed on mostly decaying carcasses and decaying plant tissues. This species of blowfly are also known to pollinate species of Hebe in alpine regions so nectar from the flowers may be another source of diet. Predators, parasites, and diseases C. quadimaculata have several different predators that include fish, spiders, frogs other bigger insects and birds. There was no sufficient evidence found of parasites and diseases affecting the New Zealand blowfly however they are known to be vectors for disease for conditions such as dysentery and can transfer bacterial infections from animals to humans. Additionally myiasis is the parasitic condition where maggots from blowflies are living in the tissue of animals and although C. quadrimaculata is not the primary cause of myiasis (other blowflies are) it can be a secondary source. Facts In terms of crime scene investigations a blowfly has the ability to get into dead buried corpses under the ground.> Blowflies can create useful evidence during postmortem intervals of crimes, especially at murder investigations. Forensic investigators look to find decay that has induced blowflies to the corpse. Blowflies can only live in a certain temperature, so forensic scientists can use the temperature as a measure on and around the body to use for evidence or judgement with murder cases.

The exact date of the proclamation Jangir Khan has not been established. There is no reliable data about the year of his birth. According to some reports, he was raised on a white rug immediately after his father's death in 1628, but its long recognized as the supreme khan of Kazakhs. Like his father Yesim Khan Jangir was also concerned about the threat of Junggar. Fears intensified after coming to power Batur-kontayshy (1635-1654), who created a strong centralized state in Dzungaria. At this point, the Kazakh Khanate occurred internecine strife. Each representative Chingizids claimed supremacy. Attempts sultans strengthen its political influence met with fierce resistance from the beys, who also sought to increase its role. The constant political struggle prevented the growth Jangir Khan's power, which always had to prove its inherited the right to rule. In one of the battles with Dzhungars in 1635 Jangir captured. After the conclusion of a peace treaty was released home with an obligation to no longer bother border Jungar khanate. An active role in the implementation of foreign policy played his son Tauke. He had friendly relations with the ruler of Samarkand Zhalantos Bahadur (1576-1656). Their union was a response to the creation of Erdeni Batur coalition to attack Zhetysu.  Battle of Orbulaq  When Erdeni Batur in 1643 seized some land in the southern and south-eastern spurs of the Tian Shan, Jangir with the host 600 people decided to meet the enemy's army, despite its significant superiority (Zhungars was about 50,000). For Battle Mountain Jangir chose a place close to the River Hor (Orbulaq) Jungar Alatau because of what called Orbulak battle. A tactic of warfare has been selected trench method. Researchers who carefully studied the place of the famous battle, note that a number of complex Jangir applied tactics of the arsenal of military art of the Kazakhs, but at the same time used the unextended fragmentation methods among the nomads of the enemy. As described by A.I. Levshin, Jangir, fearing an open military confrontation with Dzhungars, arranged part of his squad in a gorge between two mountains, he dug in advance by a deep moat and high obnesya shaft. The length of the military fort was 2.5-3 km, the front edge of the trench was as tall as a human growth.

Dubas spent his youth in various roles with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League, including a term as the team's general manager after graduating from university. He attended Brock University and graduated with a degree in Sports Management, and started his career by briefly acting as a player agent. Dubas joined the Maple Leafs organization as an assistant general manager in 2014, and played a key role in developing the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (AHL). In 2018, the Marlies captured the Calder Cup as AHL Champions. At the time of his hire, Dubas was the second youngest general manager in NHL history, behind John Chayka of the Arizona Coyotes. Dubas was born and raised in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. As a child Dubas played hockey, until concussions caused him to stop playing at 14. His father was an intern with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds and his grandfather, Walter Dubas (1929-2012), had coached the team from 1960 to 1967. Dubas attended Brock University, graduating in Sport Management (BSM). While at Brock, Dubas worked as a scout for the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. In 2015, Dubas was named the first recipient of Brock's Outstanding Young Alumni Award, for his accomplishments after graduation. Brock University has credited sharp increases in the popularity of their Sports Management program with Dubas‚Äô success early in his career, with one professor noting, \\"We absolutely have seen, anecdotally, so many students who want to be Kyle Dubas when they graduate.\\" After graduation, Dubas offered to assist with Brock University's program as either an instructor or teaching assistant. Professional career Player agent Dubas was the youngest agent ever certified by the National Hockey League Players Association. He worked with Uptown Sports Management and represented Kyle Clifford and Andrew Desjardins. Dubas set up offices in Europe; however, challenges with clients leaving for other agents resulted in Dubas looking for alternate careers in hockey. Team executive =Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds= Dubas was hired as the general manager (GM) of the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in 2011. He attended his interview with a detailed plan to improve the team, which had struggled in recent years. The Greyhounds initially were looking for an experienced candidate for the GM position, but Dubas's interview was so impressive, that he was the board's unanimous choice. During his tenure with the Greyhounds, this plan became known as \\"The Rising\\" after the Bruce Springsteen song of the same name. Dubas had been involved with the Greyhounds organization since he was a child, starting out as a stick boy and dressing room attendant when he was 11. After assuming the GM role, he hired Sheldon Keefe as head coach. The combination of Keefe and Dubas resulted in significant on ice improvement for the Greyhounds, and during Dubas's last season as GM of the Greyhounds, they finished second overall in the OHL. =Maple Leaf Sports Entertainment= In 2014, Toronto Maple Leafs team president Brendan Shanahan reached out to Dubas about the possibility of joining the organization. Their initial meeting lasted nine hours. Dubas was hired by Shanahan as an assistant general manager for the Maple Leafs in July 2014. The Maple Leafs organization deflected concerns about his age at the time he was hired, with general manager Dave Nonis saying \\"...Age was never a factor. It‚Äôs whether or not you can do the job, and it was clear to us quickly that he‚Äôs going to be good at it.\\" In January 2015, Forbes named Dubas amongst its 30 Under 30 brightest young stars in the sport industry. As an assistant GM for the club, Dubas played parts in many aspects of the organization, including personnel management and analytics, through the team's research and development group. Dubas and Mark Hunter filled the role of interim general manager for the Maple Leafs in 2015, after Nonis was fired by the club. Dubas after the Toronto Marlies won the 2018 Calder Cup Final After Shanahan hired Lou Lamoriello to serve as the team's general manager, Dubas and Hunter both took roles as assistant GM. During his time as assistant GM for the Maple Leafs, Dubas also served as general manager of the Toronto Marlies, the Maple Leafs' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate team. He was instrumental in organizing a system that developed players for the Maple Leafs team, while also being competitive in their own league. Dubas hired former Greyhounds head coach Keefe to oversee the Marlies development. In 2018, the Marlies captured the Calder Cup as the AHL champions. After the 2017‚Äì18 season, Shanahan decided not to renew Lamoriello's contract as GM, sticking to his original plan to have a fixed term on his time in the position before he transitioned into an advisory role. Dubas and his co-assistant GM Mark Hunter were considered top candidates for the position. On May 11, 2018, Dubas was named as the 17th general manager in the club's history. Shortly after Dubas was named GM, both Hunter and Lamoriello left the organization. One of Dubas's first tasks as GM of the Maple Leafs was the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. He traded the team's first round selection at 25th overall to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for their pick at 29th overall and an additional draft pick at 76th overall. The Leafs drafted Swedish defenceman Rasmus Sandin who played in the OHL for the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, Dubas's former team. During his first free agency period, Dubas made headlines by signing the top unrestricted free agent available, John Tavares to a seven-year contract. Off the ice, Dubas hired Hayley Wickenheiser to serve as assistant director of player development. When hiring scouts, Dubas introduced a system of blinded reviews, where scouting reports by potential hires were submitted anonymously, to remove bias from the process. One of the highest scorers during this stage was Noelle Needham, who was hired as an amateur scout to cover the Midwest region of the United States. Dubas has expressed a belief that increasing the diversity of the Maple Leafs staff will result in improved performance, saying \\"Research shows the more diverse your organization, the better your decision-making and the better your operation in general. If you‚Äôre only hiring white males ‚Äì and I‚Äôm saying that as a white male ‚Äì you‚Äôre probably leaving a lot of good people, in terms of where your organization can go and how it can think and how it can evolve and develop.\\" During the 2018‚Äì19 season, Dubas received praise for the way he handled allegations that defenceman Morgan Rielly used a homophobic slur during a game. Rielly was cleared the following day after an investigation by the NHL. At a press conference, the following day, Dubas said \\"It‚Äôs incumbent on us in management to build an environment if someone were gay, or were questioning their sexual orientation, that they don‚Äôt feel that they have to come in here and be somebody that they‚Äôre not.\\" Management style During his time with the Greyhounds in the OHL, Dubas believed that data could provide a way for smaller teams to close the gap with the league's traditional powerhouse programs. Initially his analytics with the Greyhounds focused on how much time the team spent controlling the puck, which was largely done using manual review of video at the time. Dubas has been particularly focused on using data and analytics to combat bias in decision making. At the 2015 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, his presentation was entitled \\"How Analytics has Limited the Impact of Cognitive Bias on Personnel Decisions.\\" In 2019, Dubas received praise from agent Dan Milstein for staying in New Jersey with Ilya Mikheyev after the latter suffered a severe cut from a skate blade, resulting in emergency surgery to repair a tendon and artery. Dubas spent three days keeping Mikheyev company in the hospital until he was cleared to travel back to Toronto. Personal life Dubas's parents divorced when he was a child, his father was a police officer and his mother worked as an ambulance dispatcher. He has four sisters. During his childhood, he spent significant amounts of time with his grandparents growing up, and would often talk about hockey and baseball with his grandfather. Dubas is married and has a son.

It was one of the first haciendas established in Yucat√°n and was in ruins by 1847. Edward Herbert Thompson, US consul in Yucat√°n, purchased Hacienda Chich√©n, including the archaeological site in 1894. He excavated, explored and exported goods from the site to the Peabody Museum for over 3 decades. In 1926, he was charged with trafficking of antiquities but the charges were later dropped and his heirs sold the site. The purchaser, Fernando Barbachano Peon is credited with beginning the tourism industry of Yucat√°n and being the first hotelier to change a hacienda into a hotel. Toponymy The name (Chichen) is a word from the Mayan language meaning mouth of the springs. How to get there Heading west out of Valladolid, via Highway 180 Carretera Costera del Golfo 48.2 km to Hacienda Chich√©n. Heading east out of Merida, via Highway 180D Merida - Cancun to Hacienda Chicken. History Some accounts claim that the hacienda at Chich√©n was built in 1523, but histories relate that the conquest of Yucat√°n began when Francisco de Montejo landed near Valladolid in 1527. He proceeded to Chich√©n Itz√°, to build one of the two fortresses he had been commissioned to establish. After securing friendship with the native population, the Spaniards built a village of houses in the same style as the natives of vertical wooden logs and palm-frond roofs. Montejo left 170 soldiers at the settlement. After a battle with the Indians, 150 of the Spanish were killed and the settlement was deserted. Though numerous attempts were made to conquer Yucat√°n, no success was made until 1540 when Montejo's son, Francisco de Montejo the Younger established a settlement at San Francisco de Campeche and then M√©rida in 1542 and finally sent a nephew to settle Valladolid in 1543. In 1888, an archaeologist visiting the site of Chich√©n Itz√° noted that an Indian raid had occurred in 1847 after which the hacienda was abandoned. He noted that the church and buildings of the large cattle hacienda were overgrown but in reasonably good condition. The church and hacienda were both constructed with stones from the Maya temples and buildings. In 1894, Edward Herbert Thompson US consul in Yucat√°n purchased Hacienda Chich√©n, which included the Chich√©n Itz√° archeological site, with funds secured by Alison V. Armour. Thompson restored the hacienda which had been destroyed during the Caste War of Yucat√°n and spent 30 years examining and excavating the archaeological site. He dredged the Cenote Sagrado (Sacred Cenote), and hired divers to explore it, shipping many of his finds to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. In 1926, the Mexican government seized Hacienda Chich√©n and charged Thompson with trafficking antiquities. After Thompson's death, the Mexican government dropped the charges and returned the property to his heirs. In 1944, Thompson's heirs sold the property to Fernando Barbachano Peon, a grandnephew of former Yucat√°n Governor Miguel Barbachano. Barbachano recognized the opportunity of creating tourism around the area's Mayan heritage and converted the hacienda into a hotel, a first for Yucat√°n and hosted the first scientific exploration by the Carnegie Institution led by Sylvanus Morley. Upon the death of Barbachano, Carmen Barbachano inherited the Hacienda Chich√©n, while her brothers inherited the remainder of the estate. The 28-room Hacienda Chich√©n has been updated into an eco-hotel featuring a Mayan holistic healing center known a Yaxkin Spa. Each of its rooms is named after one of the archaeologists who stayed there. Spacious terraces, a museum, two gardens, a conservation area of regional flora and fauna, and a private church make Hacienda Chich√©n a unique setting for private events, weddings, or photographic sessions.

The movement spread to Africa soon after the 1906 Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles.Anderson, Allan. Evangelism and the Growth of Pentecostalism in Africa. University of Birmingham, 2000. Currently, there are many self-governing, self-propagating, and self-supporting Pentecostal churches in Africa. They utilize the same means to evangelize that early Pentecostal churches used such as door-to-door evangelism, meetings held in homes of interested inquirers, preaching in trains, buses, on street corners and at places of public concourse, and 'tent crusades' held all over the continent. The Charismatic resurgence in the 1970s had a large impact on the growth of the church today. The faith is becoming one of the most substantial denominations of Christianity in Africa. However, the Roman Catholic Church remains the largest Christian body of Africa. South Africa In 1908, South Africa became one of the first African countries to receive Pentecostalism.Anderson, Allan. New African Initiated Pentecostalism and Charismatics in South Africa. Journal of Religion in Africa, Vol. 35. 2005. A major reason for the spread of the Pentecostal faith in South Africa was due to the Apostolic Faith Newspaper written by Seymour. The Apostolic Faith newspaper began circulating in Cape Town, South Africa and eventually resulted in the establishment of the Assemblies of God (AG) in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Azusa Street missionaries Thomas Hezmalhalch and John Lake carried Seymour's Pentecostal message to South Africa in 1908. They moved throughout South Africa and in 1913 Lake establish the Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa (AFMSA). In 1908 Pieter Louis Le Roux established the Pentecostal Zionist movement in South Africa. The Zionist movement and other African Instituted Churches (AICs) helped spread Seymour's message even further although it is questioned if the term Pentecostalism can be applied to them. At the beginning of the twenty-first century somewhere between 10‚Äì40% of South Africa's population could be called Pentecostal but this classification varies depending on how the religion is defined. The three largest Pentecostal denominations that are present in South Africa include the Apostolic Faith Mission, the South African Assemblies of God, and the Full Gospel Church of God. In the early 1990s, there was a surge of Nigerian, Kenyan, and Ghanaian preachers in South African townships. South Africans were intrigued by these preachers, such as the Nigerian Emmanuel Eni, due to their dramatic sermons and admittance of previously being involved with dark magic. Their sermons focused on exorcisms and this dark magic. Not only were these factors appealing to South Africans, but the preachers provided them with an alternative Christian future that contained rewards not only in the afterlife, but during life on earth. West Africa Pentecostalism was also carried to West Africa. In 1914 William Wad√© Harris carried the message of Pentecostalism with him throughout the Ivory Coast to Ghana. He would wear a white cassock and turban, holding a staff, Bible, and baptismal bowl while attacking the local spiritual beliefs and their leaders. As a result, villagers would bring their idols to him, where they would be burned and the people would receive a tap of confirmation. At the villages to which Harris travelled, he instructed the villagers to build a place of worship and, if there was already a Christian mission in the village, he would encourage them to seek out the missionaries. While Harris was spreading the teachings of Christianity, there were a number of healings and wonders, such as misfortunes to those who were not welcoming of Harris‚Äô efforts and the fact that laborers were still able to work on Sundays. As rumors of Harris‚Äô powerful demeanor and these wonders spread, masses of people flocked to him. There was an especially large following in Grand Bassam and Bingerville, as his baptisms were followed by miracles. His message converted tens of thousands of people to Christianity. It caused many Africans living on the Ivory coast to disconnect from their traditional practices, such as festivals, burial rituals, and the disappearance of huts for women during their menstrual cycle. He also dispelled ancient African sacrifices, fetishes, and dances. Missionaries from England observed how prevalent the religious differences were between the Ivory Coast and Dahomey or Togo. In 1922, Captain Paul Marty, the colonial administrator, described this distinction as a \\"religious fact, almost unbelievable, which has upset all the ideas we had about black societies of the Coast‚Äîso primitive, so rustic‚Äîand which with our occupation and as a consequence of it will be the most important political and social event of ten centuries of history, past, present or future of the maritime Ivory Coast.\\" However, many villagers were not accepted by the Church because of their refusal to abandon polygamy. In 1931, the √âglise Harriste (Harrist Church) was created by Jomas Ahui, who was consecrated by Harris. The church has 197,515 members as of October 16, 2018. It has seven weekly services (three on Sunday) and emphasizes the teachings of Harris, such as monogamy, prayer instead of sacrifice, and the abolition of fetishes. The religion also highlights the importance cross, Bible, calabash, and baptismal bowl as religious tools. In the 1970s, independent charismatic churches began to surface in West Africa at a fast pace., specifically in Nigeria and Ghana. Eventually, these independent charismatic churches began to surface in South Africa. After the government relaxed restrictions, in regards to the movement of Black South Africans, the bigger the Black Christian community grew. These converts were known as ‚ÄúBorn Agains‚Äù and they denounced the African-initiated churches. They connected to the preachers of their new religion and started their own churches and ministries. However, they were less successful than the charismatic churches run by white people. These churches were influenced by missions from the United States, but have an African foundation. Ghana Missionary Pentecostalism was introduced to Ghana during the first three decades of the 20th century.Corten, Andr√©, and Ruth Marshall. Between Babel and Pentecost. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2001. 216-30. Print. The foundation of the church was derived from the Assemblies of God and Apostolic Church in the United States and England. In Ghana, the Methodist church received over 8,000 membership requests, as well as requests for catechists in schools. Over the last 20 years, Pentecostalism has become one of the most popular forms of Christianity in Ghana. Between the years of 1987 and 1992 the church grew by about 42% as rural and urban people joined different movements of Pentecostalism. The Ghana Pentecostal Council serves the needs of 120 churches in Ghana. Liberia In August, 1906, Lucy Farrow, Julia Hutchins, and others arrived in Liberia, the first location in Africa to receive Pentecostal missionaries.Espinosa, Gast√≥n. William J. Seymour and the Origins of Global Pentecostalism: A Biography and Documentary History. Duke UP, 2014. Print. Farrow wrote to William J. Seymour saying that God had given her the ability to speak in the Kru language and that she could therefore baptize and heal many natives. Shortly after, other missionaries from the United States joined Farrow in Africa to Pentecostal faith. In 1916, the Methodist Episcopal church noted that ‚ÄúLiterally thousands, largely young people, have been swept in to the kingdom of God. Revivals were held and eventually the first permanent Azusa- influenced Pentecostal mission in Africa was founded. However, some American missionaries reported that some areas of Africa already developed manifestations of the Holy Spirit prior to 1906.Kalu, Ogbu. African Pentecostalism: An Introduction. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2008. Print. Many indigenous churches were established prior to foreign missionaries on the foundation of the power of the Holy Spirit. In Congo Brazzaville, Ghana, and Nigeria movements that could be classified as Pentecostal had all taken on different African names.  Nigeria  Pentecostalism began in Nigeria during the early twentieth century as a renewal movement to the prominent mission churches in Africa. At first, the growth of Pentecostalism was due to the efforts to break free from Western missionary control. This resulted in the popularity of many AICs (African-initiated churches), which focused on prophecy and healing. The second wave of Pentecostalism arose as a result of the Nigerian Civil War among students and young people who belonged to Pentecostal churches, mainline churches, and the Scripture Union. Pentecostal churches, especially large charismatic churches have become popular in Nigeria, competing for membership with Catholic churches and other Christian confessions. A growing number of Nigerian students shrive Catholicism and Pentecostalism at the same time. Nigeria has the largest population of Pentecostals in Africa and, in a study from 2006, three out of ten Nigerians identify as either Pentecostal of Charismatic. Since Islam is prevalent in Nigeria, there exists a tension between the Northern Hausa-Fulani, who are predominantly Muslim, the Eastern Igbo, who are predominantly Christian, and the Western Yoruba, whose population is divided among the two religions. Nonetheless, the Christian population has continued to grow in Nigeria. For example, the Redeemed Church of God, which was founded in Nigeria, has over 14,000 branches worldwide and has branches in over 140 nations.  Ethiopia  Anna-Liisa and Sanfrid Mattson, Pentecostal missionaries from Finland, brought Pentecostalism to Ethiopia in 1951. Pentecostalism in Ethiopia continued to develop and eventually the Full Gospel Believer's Church (FBGC) was created in 1967. Approximately 2 million people claim to be Pentecostal in Ethiopia today.\\"Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements in Ethiopia ‚Äî European Research Network on Global Pentecostalism\\". www.glopent.net. Retrieved 2015-05-01.  Zambia  Pentecostalism in Zambia gained a following within the rich, white miners. Then, Pentecostal missions started to spread Christianity in Zambia, the most notable mission being the Pentecostal Assemblies of God. Now known as the Pentecostal Assemblies of God in Zambia, this denomination is the largest of its kind in Zambia with over 1,200 branches. Bread of Life Church International in Lusaka is Zambia‚Äôs largest single congregation with about 10,000 members.

Background Boko Haram is an insurgent group founded in 2002. Initially, the group was focused on ending Western-style education in Nigeria, which the group views as a violation of Muslim law. In 2009, the group launched a military campaign to create an Islamic state. Boko Haram has steadily gained influence and launched increasingly deadly campaigns. The group began to seize territory aggressively in late 2014, declaring northeast Nigeria to be a caliphate under their control. By the end of 2014, Boko Haram controlled an area roughly the size of Belgium. In 2014, the group killed an estimated 10,000 people, mostly in northeast Nigeria. Through April, Boko Haram forces killed around 2,000 people in 2015. More than 1.5 million people were displaced by Boko Haram activities. In addition to killing raids, the group has regularly organized mass kidnappings. In April 2014, the group drew international attention by kidnapping 276 schoolgirls in Chibok. In total, the group seized around 2,000 women and girls in 2014. Boko Haram has been called one of the world's deadliest terrorist groups. The offensive On January 23, 2015, it was disclosed that Nigerian troops were in final preparations for a major offensive against Boko Haram insurgents in North Eastern Nigeria. According to leaked security information, the final straw that prompted action was a Boko Haram video claiming that it had stockpiled \\"enough weapons to take on Nigeria and its neighbours\\". The video also prompted Cameroon, Chad, and Niger to acknowledge the threat of growing Boko Haram power and pledge military support for the operation. The goal of the campaign was to eliminate \\"safe havens and escape routes of terrorists in or out of Nigeria\\" and provide \\"once and for all comprehensive operations\\" to eliminate the Boko Haram threat. Originally, the operation was expected to be complete before the planned February 14 elections. A few days later, operations commenced. On February 4, after days of airstrikes, Chadian forces entered Boko Haram held Gamboru, Nigeria. An estimated 200 Boko Haram insurgents were killed in the offensive. Nine Chadian soldiers were killed and 21 injured in the attacks. Commander Ahmat Dari remarked \\"We have routed this band of terrorists\\" and vowed to \\"hunt them down everywhere.\\" Boko Haram responded the next day by raiding nearby Fotokol, Cameroon. The fighting left 81 civilians, 13 Chadian soldiers, and 6 Cameroonian soldiers dead. However, eyewitness also reported Boko Haram took heavy casualties leaving dead insurgents \\"everywhere\\". Boko Haram reportedly burned the town's mosque and indiscriminately slit civilians' throats. Civilian Joint Task Force militiamen in southeastern Borno State, February 2015 By February 6, Chadian and Nigerian warplanes and ground troops had forced Boko Haram forces to abandon about a dozen towns and villages. The French military also aided in the offensive by providing reconnaissance flights. In response, Boko Haram attacked two villages in Nigeria and another in Cameroon, killing more than 100 civilians. In a battle on February 6, an estimated 100 insurgents, several military personnel, and one civilian were killed. On February 7, Nigeria announced that the elections would be postponed for six weeks, citing unsafe voting conditions in the northeast. A small protest was held in response to the announcement with police preventing protesters from entering the electoral commission headquarters. An agreement to provide 7,500 African Union Troops from Chad, Cameroon, Benin and Niger for the operation was tentatively reached on February 7. On February 17, the Nigerian military retook Monguno in a coordinated air and ground assault. Also on February 17, Chadian forces began an attack on the Kala/Balge district of Nigeria aimed at capturing the strategic town of Dikwa. Boko Haram suffered heavy casualties and Dikwa fell by February 24. As troops approached the Sambisa Forest, Boko Haram launched a series of retaliatory raids. Gunmen shot and stabbed civilians and burned homes, apparently targeting Shuwa tribesmen ‚Äì the same ethnicity of most Chadian soldiers. During the week of February 15, more than 300 Boko Haram fighters were killed by Nigerian forces as eleven more towns were recaptured. Various weapon stockpiles were seized or destroyed, and additional insurgents were arrested. Two Nigerian soldiers were killed in the fighting and ten others injured. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau promised to disrupt the elections, then scheduled for March 28, in retaliation. Separately, an apparently errant bombing mission killed 37 mourners attending a funeral in Abadam, Niger. On February 28, a large rally was held in the Cameroonian capital of Yaounde in support of the Central African forces fighting Boko Haram. An estimated 5,000 people marched through the street of the capital. Niger Army soldiers with a killed Boko Haram fighter in Diffa, March 2015 On March 6, the African Union officially endorsed sending 8,000 troops to help secure the Nigerian border, but declined to allow the troops to enter Nigeria. As Boko Haram continued to lose territory, the group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant on March 7. Nigerian army spokesperson Sami Usman Kukasheka said the pledge was a sign of weakness and that Shekau was like a \\"drowning man\\". That same day, Boko Haram launched an attack against Maiduguri, a former stronghold of the group. The attack, which including suicide bombings, left more than 50 people dead. A fresh offensive against Boko Haram by a coalition of Chadian, Cameroonian, and Nigerian forces began on March 8 after a series of air strikes the previous two days. On March 16, the Nigerian army recaptured Bama. On 24 March 2015, residents of Damasak, Nigeria said that Boko Haram had taken more than 400 women and children from the town as they fled from coalition forces earlier in the month. On March 27, the Nigerian army captured Gwoza, which was believed to be the location of Boko Haram headquarters. According to the army, the victory meant that \\"virtually all\\" of Boko Haram's territory had been recaptured a day before the elections. Ahead of the attack, Boko Haram reportedly executed all of the town's citizens unable or unwilling to help defend it against the military's advance. BBC analyst Tomi Oladipo called the victory a major milestone for Nigeria. Boko Haram had held the town since August 2014 when Nigerian troops abandoned the city. The victory came days after Chad President Idriss Deby criticized Nigerian forces for not pulling their weight in the fight against Boko Haram. On election day, Boko Haram militants killed 41 people, including a legislator, in an effort to disrupt voting. After Muhammadu Buhari defeated incumbent president Goodluck Jonathan in the election, the fight against Boko Haram continued. (Jonathan remained in power until May 29.) On April 8, a summit of Central and West African leaders was held with the aim of fine tuning strategy in order to \\"eradicate\\" the insurgency group. Ahead of the summit, a Chadian army spokesperson called Boko Haram's capacity to cause problems severely reduced. However, Nigeria said the group continued to wage an \\"asymmetric war\\" through the use of suicide bombers and guerilla tactics. The United Nation's Human Rights Council unanimously adopted a resolution calling for greater international support of the counter- insurgency campaign. Hostage rescues Map of Boko Haram's territorial control by April 2015, over 2 months after the start of the offensive On April 22, the Nigerian military began to push into the Sambisa Forest, a dense forest covering 23,000 square miles. The area is considered very difficult to navigate by people unfamiliar with the terrain and has long been considered the launching point of many Boko Haram attacks and likely hiding point of villagers taken hostage. It is considered the last stronghold of Boko Haram. A government spokesman said a top Boko Haram commander was killed in the initial push. Frank Charnas, a political analyst familiar with the region, said the move signaled the end of Boko Haram as a military force. \\"They really are fighting what appears to be their last battle\\", he added. \\"It does represent quite a significant step on behalf of the Nigerian military because up until now they have not gone into the Sambisa Forest and have also been pretty poor at taking the offensive to Boko.\\" The Nigerian military had to retreat after encountering landmines and booby traps that killed three vigilantes working with the military, but continued its push after regrouping. On April 25, Boko Haram launched a counterattack on an island in Lake Chad. Forty-six Nigeran soldiers and 28 civilians were killed in the attack. After the attack, Niger recommended that the island of Lake Chad be evacuated. By early May, more than 5,000 people had left the island towns and reached N'guigmi, Niger by foot. An additional 11,500 evacuees were expected. A fresh push into Sambisa Forest by Nigerian forces began on April 27. As the Nigerian army advanced into the forest, it began to free a large number of women and children held as hostages by Boko Haram. On April 28, just under 300 hostages were freed. It is unclear if the freed prisoners were captured in Boko Haram raids or if they were area residents. A firefight on April 29 killed over 400 Boko Haram insurgents, while freeing an undisclosed number of female captives. One soldier was killed and four seriously injured in the battle. One woman was killed and eight injured. On April 30, another 234 women and children were free from Boko Haram captivity as the military destroyed 13 Boko Haram camps. In total, close to 700 hostages have been rescued. Hostages rescued during the offensive Freed captives had been subjected to forced labor, as well as sexual and physical abuse. Some were forced to fight alongside Boko Haram rebels or were used as human shields. According to initial reports, some of the captives were traumatized to the point where they fired upon their rescuers, believing the militants were \\"good people who had treated them well\\". Others painted a different picture, saying their captors kept them indoors, brought out only when needed to retrieve food. They were severely beaten and given only minimal food ‚Äì rescued children were described as visibly malnourished by the press. Other children had forgotten their own names. Amnesty International African director Netsanet Belay remarked \\"The trauma suffered by the women and girls is truly horrific.\\" An aid worker described the captives as \\"not in great condition ...All of them are traumatized. They're hungry. They're sick.\\" Of the first 275 captives, only 61 were over the age of 18; 214 were visibly pregnant. None of them knew the location of the Chibok girls, but said militants who visited their camp had claimed the girls were sold or forced into polygamous marriages with militants. According to freed hostages, Boko Haram was running short of weapons as a result of the multinational offensive. Frustrated by the lack of support from their leadership, militants were abandoning the hostages with minimal fight, or attempting to sell them for 2,000 naira (US$10) or less. One hostage reported overhearing militants talking about how their leaders had deceived them into using violence. Further efforts Efforts to press into the Sambisa Forest were slowed, as the military encountered landmines and booby traps. Boko Haram pushed back, launching suicide attacks on civilians and attempting to capture the Giwa Barracks in Maiduguri. The attack was repelled, but about 30 civilians were killed in the crossfire, bringing the number of civilians killed in the counter-attack to 60. On May 15, Boko Haram forces recaptured the border town of Marte, demonstrating that efforts to contain the militant group to the forest were not completely successful. Deputy governor of Borno State, Zannah Umar Mustapha, said militants has returned to various previously cleared towns to resume the fighting. The following day, the Nigerian military destroyed ten Boko Haram camps in the Sambisa Forest. One soldier and an unspecified number of militants were killed in the raids. In September 2015, the Director of Information at the Defence Headquarters of Nigeria announced that all Boko Haram camps had been destroyed. Rescues were still ongoing as of October 2015.Nigeria: Army Frees Women and Child Hostages of Boko Haram. By Bashir adigun, Associated Press ABUJA, Nigeria ‚Äî Sep 15, 2015, 8:01 PM ET.

Its debut album Stone was produced by Mauro Malavasi and recorded in Fonoprint Studios in Bologna. My Mine's first single, \\"Hypnotic Tango\\", became an international hit across Europe. After about a year from his first single, My Mine recorded its second single called \\"Zorro\\". They had set themselves the idea of doing something more innovative and they spent almost a month in the studio in Bologna. They made the mistake of leaving the sound of \\"Hypnotic Tango\\", and \\"Zorro\\" was a flop. From there, a dark period began. The production advised them to choose an English singer in place of Stefano Micheli. Darren Hatch arrived from London. So, My Mine started to produce the album, Stone. However, the intention of My Mine and production was to recover the popularity and fame. The last attempt was the song \\"Can Delight\\", which the production decided to make them play because it was catchy and which, according to them, could bring them back to the fore. However, it was not enough. In 1986, the band broke up after releasing \\"Can Delight\\". After that, the members of My Mine continued a couple of years composing songs but without being able to produce them.

As a result of her discoveries Bingham had a genus and several algae species named in her honor. Biography Early life and marriage Bingham was born in 1831 in Pennsylvania. She and her family shifted to Ohio around 1836. She married her husband, Richard Fitch Bingham in Ohio and subsequently the couple moved to California in 1873. At around this time she took up the study of botany. Botany work Bingham was one of the earliest American women to publish a scientific paper on botany. She is one of only six American women listed in the London Royal Society Catalogue of Science Papers 1800 - 1900 whose journal articles pre date 1880. Her first known article was published in the Botanical Gazette in 1879. Bingham was a member of the Santa Barbara Natural History Society and held the position of Secretary of the Society. She was also a member of the publication committee for the Bulletin of the Santa Barbara Society and published an article in that journal in March 1887. As well as publishing papers on her botany work Bingham collaborated with botanists such as Alpheus Hervey, William Gilson Farlow and Jacob Georg Agardh. Bingham assisted their work by providing specimens, lists of plants she collected, notes on special habitat, seasons of growth and frequency of appearance. Bingham also corresponded with Joseph Dalton Hooker at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew on botanical matters. Her specimens continue to be studied and are held at various herbaria including the United States National Herbarium, the Gray Herbarium, the Steere Herbarium of the New York Botanical Garden, the University of Notre Dame herbarium, the University of California herbarium, the California Academy of Sciences herbarium and the Farlow Herbarium at Harvard University Death Her husband died in 1895 and she subsequently moved to New Bedford where she died aged 101.

He is most known for running a nation-wide Ponzi scheme in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the 90s. In 1992, he established the Jugoskandik Savings Bank, the first privately owned bank in Serbia (which was, at the time, part of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). Although Jugoskandik operated in Serbia, the banking license was provided by Banka Privatne Privrede (BPP), bank owned by the local government of Montenegro (another constituent republic within Yugoslavia). He unsuccessfully ran for President of Serbia in the 1992 elections. Vasiljeviƒá also organized and sponsored the 1992 match between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky, which took place in the exclusive resort of Sveti Stefan and drew significant media attention both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Since Yugoslavia was under UN sanctions at the time, participation at the match has caused Bobby Fischer legal trouble and practically forced him to live as an √©migr√©.http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/14135/posljednje-utociste-za- poludjelog-velemajstora, Nacional According to some sources, Vasiljeviƒá's initial investment capital was made through a marriage with a Swedish woman from a wealthy family.http://www.vreme.co.rs/cms/view.php?id=935208, Vreme However, Jugoskandik itself was merely a front for a Ponzi Scheme (this scheme was also described in his country as a Pyramid scheme, although the two terms are not entirely identical in meaning) . The obtained money was used to bypass internationally imposed sanctions and import oil into Yugoslavia via Montenegrin seaports. The oil was later sold within Yugoslavia (mostly in Serbia), and Jugoskandik savers were paid off from the profit. According to Vasiljeviƒá's own words, at the request of BPP's CEO Milorad Vukotiƒá, some 62,000 tons of oil were confiscated from the Montenegrin repositories in Bar and Kotor, a move which marked the end of Jugoskandik. The Jugoskandik collapse, together with the almost simultaneous collapse of another pyramidal bank, Dafiment, represented a disastrous blow to the Serbian economy, already weakened by the Yugoslav Wars.

Serving as an assistant surgeon at Ellis Island during the early 1900s, he made major contributions to intelligence testing through the methods he devised to screen immigrants for mental deficiencies...Knox, H. A. (1914). A scale, based on the work at Ellis Island, for estimating mental defect. Journal of the American Medical Association, 62(10), 741-747 However, at the time of his death, he was most well known as a veteran, a general physician, and a contributing member of his community, and his contributions to intelligence testing had become largely forgotten. Although his work in this area has become largely overlooked, his contributions have served as an important link between early intelligence research and present day intelligence testing.Richardson, J. T. (2013). Howard Andrew Knox: pioneer of intelligence testing at Ellis Island. Columbia University Press Personal life Howard Andrew Knox was born on March 7, 1885, in Romeo, Michigan, just north of Detroit, Michigan. He was the only child of Howard Reuben Knox and Jennie Mahaffy Knox. Howard's father was originally from Ashtabula County, Ohio, and worked as a traveling salesman. Like Howard, his mother Jennie was born in Romeo, although she spent her youth in Ireland until moving back to Ohio as an adolescent to help her father on his farm. Howard's parents were married in 1879, after which Howard Senior moved in with Jennie to help on her father's farm in Romeo. When Howard A. was born, the three generations moved together to Ashtabula, Ohio, near Lake Erie. Howard's parents eventually divorced when his father moved to Virginia for work, although his father remained in touch until his death in the 1920s. In 1894, at the age of nine, Howard's mother remarried to a man named Leander Blackwell, who, as a medical doctor himself, may have influenced Howard's career path. Knox met his wife, Marion Dorothy Henderson, while he was at his first job after graduating from medical school. Little is known about Marion, other than that she was the third cousin of Howard's mother's side of the family. Howard and Marion were married in 1906, and divorced in 1910 after Howard's ailing mother had moved in with the married couple which led to a marital dispute. In early 1911, Howard took leave from the army to marry Gladys Barnett Reed, a woman of family wealth from Brooklyn, New York.The Journal of The American Medical Association, 56:1 Details of how they met are unknown, but it is clear that by marrying Gladys, Howard advanced into a higher social class. Howard and Gladys had a baby girl, Dorothea, on October 28, 1911; and a second daughter, Gladys Sprague Knox, in January 1913. In 1914, Howard and Gladys Knox divorced. Knox married Maka Harper in 1916 and had a daughter, Carolyn Knox (later Carolyn Knox Whaley) and two sons, Howard Knox and Robert Harper Knox. Education After graduating from high school in Willimantic, Connecticut, Knox enrolled in the Medical School at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Only a few months after enrolling, his stepfather was killed in a tragic accident involving a freight train at a railway crossing, for which his mother later brought suit against the Central Vermont Railway Company Supreme Court of Connecticut Third Judicial District (1906). Metcalf v. Central Vermont Railway Co., New Haven, CT. Compounding this loss, Howard's grandfather also died several months later, and Knox withdrew from his studies at Dartmouth for a period of time to help his mother. He returned to his studies and received his medical doctorate on March 27, 1908. While in medical school, Knox had completed some specialization in psychiatry and upon graduating he took a staff job at the Worcester Insane Hospital, in Worcester, MA, near his mother. Although the Worcester Insane Hospital had originally been a promising model for many institutions, by the time Knox took the job, the hospital was in deep decline.Mora, G. (1969). Gerald Grob. The State and the Mentally Ill. A History of Worcester State Hospital in Massachusetts, 1830‚Äì1920. Chapel Hill: Univ. NC Press, 1966, pp. XV+ 399 However, a new opportunity opened for Knox, when in 1908 Congress approved a reorganization of the army's medical department, officially designating the Army's regular physicians within the Medical Department as the Medical Corps. In order to be trained in the area of military medicine, physicians were called to become part of the army through the Medical Reserve Corps.Stewart, R. W. (2005). American Military History: The United States Army and the forging of a nation, 1775-1917. Government Printing Office. Knox applied to this program several months later and was accepted into the Medical Reserve Corps with the rank of first lieutenant. Career US Army (1908-1911) Howard began his military career as a surgeon at Fort Michie, on Great Gull Island in Long Island Sound, off of New London, Connecticut. Most coastal forts, especially those that were relatively isolated from major cities (like Fort Michie), had their own hospitals. Howard and his wife arrived at Fort Michie on October 3, 1908 and lived there for about a year. It was here that Marion gave birth to their daughter, Violet in 1909; however, Violet was not healthy and died within a few months. After receiving high reviews from his commanding officer in 1909, Knox decided to seek a position at the Army Medical Corps. To do so, he underwent training for one year at The Army Medical School in Washington, D.C. After a year, he graduated forty- fourth in his class of fifty-four students in April 1910. His first station was as an assistant to the general surgeon at Fort Hancock in New Jersey. That summer, he made first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Medical Corps. Not long after, Howard's mother became sick and moved in with Howard and Marion. A matrimonial dispute occurred, which is not well documented, but it is clear that Marion left and later filed a complaint with the War Department stating that Howard had left her and failed to provide financial support. Howard replied, claimed that Marion refused to live with him unless his mother left the house. The War Department was satisfied with this response and determined that no action would be taken, however, it has been suggested that this event may have colored Howard's reputation with the army. In summer 1910 Howard was placed at Fort Ethan Allen, which had opened only three years earlier in 1908 near Lake Ontario, as an army training center.Roberts, R. R. 1988. Encyclopedia of Historic Forts: The Military, Pioneer, and Trading Posts of the United States. New York: Macmillan. During his first month, he worked at the stationary hospital at Pine Camp, which would have served those injured during training at Pine Camp.McKee, S.H. 1919. The work of a stationary hospital in the field. Canadian Medical Association Journal, 9:49-51. During his time here he did take ten days leave to return to Fort Hancock where he again served as the assistant to the general surgeon. Here he drafted his first publication, a brief case report on a young patient with filariasis.Knox, H.A. 1911. Filariasis at Fort Hancock, New Jersey. Military Surgeon 28 (June):659-60 In January 1911, Howard took an official leave from the army to marry Gladys Barnett Reed After Fort Ethan Allen, Howard was assigned as assistant to the surgeon at the infirmary of the Third Provisional Regiment in Fort Crockett, which had recently reopened after sustaining hurricane damage in 1900. Here he was on duty beginning March 18, 1911. In April however, he requested to be restationed at Fort Hancock near his mother, to assist her as she needed to have surgery. Although his commanding officer supported his transition, the paperwork was not received by the adjutant general until nearly a week later. The surgeon general was consulted, who had previously been the president of the Army Medical School during Howard's enrollment and had written a positive evaluation regarding Howard during that time. However, at this time he noted that several events had rendered Howard's future with the army to be uncertain, and thus recommended resignation. Howard officially resigned from the Army at the end of April, 1911. Civilian career After leaving the Army, Howard and his wife moved to Sheffield in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Here, Howard started his own practice as a general physician. In 1910, lectures given by Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung were published in the American Journal of Psychology, and their work was well known among psychologists as well as medical doctors during this time. Howard Knox was among those interested physicians, and he showed an early interested in intelligence. His first article on the topic was published in 1913 in the Journal of the American Medical Association,Knox, H.A. 1913. The moron and the study of alien defectives. Journal of the American Medical Association (January 11): 105-106. in which he demonstrated not only an interest in intelligence testing but also in its cultural sensitivity. In this article, Knox focuses on the differentiation between those with ‚Äúmental aberration‚Äù or active insanity, versus those ‚Äúmental defectives‚Äù classified as ‚Äúmorons and constitutional inferior types.‚Äù It was during this time that Alfred Binet was publishing his research on intelligence testing.Binet, A. 1903. The experimental study of intelligence. Paris: Schleicher.Binet, A. 1911. New research on the measurement of intellectual level in schoolchildren. In this JAMA article, Knox draws reference to Binet's research and the development of intelligence tests during the time. He pointed out that although intelligence tests can differentiate the less intelligent, less well developed class of people, if administered to individuals from another culture or country, the individuals might be incorrectly classified as morons. He wrote, ‚Äúif these peasants are questioned about conditions existing in the land from which they come, most of them will show average intelligence‚Äù Knox continued to show interest in psychology in his next article, also published in 1913.Knox, H.A. 1913. Some practical psychotherapy. Journal of the American Medical Association, 60: 105-106. In this article he wrote about a case he had seen in Sheffield, a man who had persistent persecutory delusions. Knox stated that for a period of time, he had listened to this man recount his delusions and wrote down the details in his notebook. After a period of time, the man appeared to recover; and Knox believed that by writing down his delusions, he had validated the patient which contributed to his improvement. In October 1911, Knox attempted to rejoin the army and applied to the office of the surgeon general for readmission. His application was received in 1912, and unfortunately his application was not well received. Although it is not clear precisely why Knox fell out of favor of the army, there are several possibilities. It is possible that his discovery and reported treatment of rampant venereal disease while at Fort Hancock was frowned upon, as at the time venereal disease was quite stigmatizing and his treatment of it might have been considered immoral. It is also possible that the rapid dissolution of his marriage to Marion, and quick remarriage to Gladys, painted him as an unreliable man. In any case, he was not permitted readmission to the army. Nevertheless, he did find success in another branch of the government. In October 1911, in addition to reapplying to the army, Howard also applied to the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service. Officers were only selected from the pool of applicants twice per year,Mullan, F. 1989. Plagues and Politics: The Story of the United States Public Health Service. New York: Basic. so it was not until April 1912 that he went before a board of examiners. Knox scored an average of 84.99 percent, which led to his appointment with the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service in New York City. In May he was assigned to work in the immigration station at Ellis Island. At the time there was a movement to restrict immigration into the US, as it was widely believed that ‚Äúmorons‚Äù or feebleminded individuals were the cause of many societal problems and that border authorities were weakening the nation by allowing far too many of these individuals to enter the country.Hall, P.F. 1913. The recent history of immigration and immigration restriction. Journal of Political Economy, 21: 735-51. Ellis Island on New York Harbor was the hub for arrival when the immigration station there was rebuilt in 1900. At first, emigrants were lined up and inspected primarily for medical ailments, initially based on the individual's overall appearance. More scrutizing inspections were conducted if an individual was flagged for some ailment.Wilson, J.G. 1911. Some remarks concerning diagnosis by inspection. New York Medical Journal, 94. For the most part, until this time, any concern regarding mental disorders was limited to psychiatric illnesses. However, as Francis Galton's ideas regarding eugenics.Galton, F. 1888. Co-relations and their measurement, chiefly from anthropometric data. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 45. became more popular in the early 1900s, concerns for that feebleminded individuals were weakening society grew, and mental deficiency among emigrants also became a concern. Another important contributing factor was the development of intelligence tests during this time. Both Alfred Binet and his student Theodore Simon were leaders in this development. Henry Goddard, a prominent eugenicist of the time who had been using Binet and Simon‚Äôs scale to measure intelligence in adults, suggested that theses could be used to identify feebleminded or mentally deficient individuals at Ellis Island who posed a threat to the integrity of society.Synderman, M., Hernstein, R.J. Intelligence Tests and the Immigration Act of 1924. American Psychologist, 38, 9. By 1910, the concerns for mentally defective people entering the United States had grown to such an extent that the officials at Ellis Island invited Henry Goddard to teach the physicians about intelligence testing.Zenderland, L. 1998. Measuring Minds: Henry Herbert Goddard and the Origins of American Intelligence Testing. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. However, after spending an entire day there, Goddard had no recommendations for the physicians, as he was impressed by both the size of the problem as well as the physicians ability to detect defect given the number of individuals coming through the immigration station.Goddard, H. The feeble minded immigrant. Training School, 9. Knox‚Äôs appointment at Ellis Island allowed him to make what was his most significant contribution to medical science. Early in their time at Ellis Island, both Knox and his colleague, Glueck recognized two issues with using the Binet and Simon scales to measure intelligence in emigrants.Knox, H.A. 1913. The moron and the study of alien defectives. Journal of American Medical Association, 60. First, the scale tested semantic knowledge that was specific to geographic location or culture. Individuals from other cultures might not fare well on these tests, and thus the measures could inaccurately classify them as mentally defective, when tests specific to their own location or culture would not. Further, the normative data used for comparing any individual score to an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù individual of the same age was based on French or American schoolchildren, which would not be appropriate for determining mental fitness for entering the United States. Knox set out to address the first problem, in his article published in the November issue of the New York Medical Journal in 1913.Knox, H.A. 1913. The differentiation between moronism and ignorance. The New York Medical Journal, 98. In this paper, he put forth two new performance tests, that were not based on verbal or cultural knowledge. The Cube Imitation Test, also known as Knox Cubes, consisted of four large black cubes and one small black cube. The examiner moves the small cube slowly and deliberately in various patterns in relation to the larger four cubes. The examinee is asked to imitate the movements conducted by the examiner. Each trial increases in difficulty and complexity. He also introduced a form board test (called the Geographical Puzzle, or ‚ÄúG‚Äù Test), which involved fitting pieces into proper places on a board, requiring both motor coordination as well as decision making. He believed that together these two tests could determine with increased accuracy whether an emigrant was mentally deficient, as neither required specific cultural knowledge for successful performance. It appeared as if Knox had found his niche, as he published follow up articles on the Cube Imitation Test and other intelligence tests to be used at Ellis Island. In late 1913, he published a short article as a follow up of the original Cube Imitation Test paper, in which he introduced a new form board, which normally developing six-year-olds were reportedly easily able to complete. He argued that adults who were not able to complete the task in the same time as six- year-olds should be classified as Imbeciles; thus, it was called the Imbecile Test Knox, H.A. A Test for adult imbeciles and six year old normal. New York Medical Journal, 98. In this article he also introduced another test, which he called the Moron test, which was also a form board that could be completed by ten-year-olds rather quickly, and thus, adults who could not complete this test in the same amount of time were determined to be morons.

A scale, based on the work at Ellis Island, for estimating mental defect. Journal of the American Medical Association, 62, 741-71 On his series of make-up tests, Knox also introduced the idea that various start points should be implemented on tests involving tasks which could be reportedly mastered at various ages; specifically, if an individual was assumed to be at a mental age of 9, they should begin the series of tests on the item that was ostensibly able to be successfully completed by a nine year old. Before long, Knox's tests became well known among medical doctors and psychologists throughout the United States. Other physicians at Ellis Island also published similar articles expressing concerns similar to Knox's regarding the cultural sensitivity of many of the established intelligence tests, indicating that he was not alone in his concerns. Yet, Knox left Ellis Island in May 1916, and did not return to the field of intelligence testing. In 1916, Knox remarried to a woman named Maka Harper. He and his new wife took a short honeymoon, and during this time he resigned from Ellis Island. He moved back to Ashtabula, Ohio, where he had lived until the age of nine. He lived here for a short time and then moved to Skillman, New Jersey to take a position as the clinical director in the New Jersey State Village for Epileptics. He worked here for five months, after which he opened a private practice in Hudson City, New Jersey. In 1922, he and his family moved to New Hampton, New Jersey, where he lived until he died of arteriosclerosis in 1949.

The Port of Jeju is used for cruise ships and exports of goods. Jeju island is home to the second biggest airport in South Korea after Incheon. Jeju (also romanized as Cheju) was made into a seaport around 1913 but it has had a long cultural importance. Inside the port there are three holes named Samseonghyeol (Caves of the Three Clans), as stated in legend the three ancestral families (the Samseong-Ko, Pu, and Yang) of Jeju came from to inhabit the island. The name Jeju wasn‚Äôt used until 1221. Under the reign of King Ui-jong the island was named Tamna-hyeon. From 1105 to 1153 it was called Taman-Gun by order of the Goryeo court. Before the name changes it was known simply as Takna. The Port held the Hangpaduseong fortress in 1271 during a struggle between rebels versus the Goryeo army and the allied Mongols. The Goryeo army won taking the rebels out after two years. Afterwards in 1273 a military governor was in place for around a hundred years. The system was put in place by Goryeo King Wonjong. With this new centralized government the previous independence of the island was ended. For brief period in 1895 a vice governor was instated by King Gojong. The name of the island was also changed from Jeju-mok to Jeju-bu. During the early 20th century the Port went through a few changes. By 1910 the county chief system replaced the Moksa system that was fading since 1906. At that time Japan occupied Korea and replaced the county chief system with their Island system. The Port of Jeju received township status in 1931, the only town on island to receive that status. Post World War ll the Port of Jeju regained its independence in 1946. Two years later a rebellion resulted in burning the Port of Jeju provincial administrative building, which was rebuilt in 1952. Three years after, the township was expanded to a city with 40 administrative wards, later reduced to 14 in 1962. The 1980‚Äôs brought more changes with new administrative are and a new provincial office building. Jeju was made up of the city port, two counties, seven townships, six districts, and 17 wards. In 1993 a plan for a joint civilian military port was made. The civilian military complex port was opened to the public in 2016 and can house two 150,000 ton ships.

An English translation by Juliet Winters Carpenter was published in 1983. Each of the novel's three sections takes its name from a type of Noh mask. Many elements of the novel were influenced by The Tale of Genji, which Enchi had earlier translated into modern Japanese. Plot summary The novel is split into three sections, each named for a particular noh mask: Ry≈ç no Onna, Masugami and Fukai. Ry≈ç no Onna In a coffee shop on the second floor of Kyoto station, two men, Ibuki and Mikame, discuss their mutual love interest, Yasuko Togano, her relationship with her mother-in-law Mieko and the s√©ance in which the four had participated on the seventeenth of the previous month. The men are old friends from college and Mikame is a bachelor and practicing psychologist, whilst Ibuki is a married university professor with a wife and child. Both Yasuko and Mieko are widowed and although Yasuko's husband Akio was killed in an avalanche on Mount Fuji a year into their marriage, Yasuko chose to stay with her mother-in-law at the Togano house after his death. The four are joined by an intellectual interest in Heian era spirit possession, on the subject of which Yasuko is continuing the research begun by her husband before his death. Ibuki is invited to join Mikame and the two women on a trip to visit the estate of the ailing noh master, Yorihito Yakushiji, and to see his collection of costumes and masks. Yasuko is particularly disturbed by the ‚Äúhaughty cruelty‚Äù of the Z≈ç no Onna mask and is attended by Mikame after experiencing a dizzy spell. The old master has insisted that Mieko and the others see the Ry≈ç no Onna mask, said to represent \\"the vengeful spirit of an older woman tormented beyond the grave by unrequited love‚Äù. On the train back to Tokyo, Yasuko reveals to Ibuki that her dead husband has a twin sister, Harume, who lives with her and Mieko at the Togano household but was raised away from her brother at the home of her maternal grandparents. Yasuko demonstrates some inclination of a romantic bent towards Ibuki but signals her intention to marry the bachelor Mikame, for fear that her true feelings are being manipulated by her scheming mother-in-law, Mieko. Ibuki urges Yasuko to get off the train with him and the pair disembark at the seaside resort of Atami, where they spend the night together. Back in Tokyo, Ibuki receives a call from Mikame, who alerts him to the existence of an old forgotten essay, entitled The Shrine in the Fields, published by Mieko Togano shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Ibuki deems the essay, which suggests that the relationship between Genji and Lady Rokuj≈ç in The Tale of Genji was far more than a passing affair, bold and somewhat over-defensive, though he finds her hypothesis intriguing. As Ibuki‚Äôs wife, Sadako, calls him to bed he asks her if she believes she could be induced to engage in spirit possession but she dismisses the idea as ridiculous. Masugami Yasuko has a nightmare about her husband‚Äôs death in an avalanche and is comforted by Mieko, who holds her in an intimate embrace. Yasuko questions Mieko about her intentions for her with regards Ibuki but Mieko attests her innocence, claiming that she only wants to provide for Yasuko‚Äôs happiness. Yasuko then turns her attention to the essay The Shrine in the Fields whereupon Mieko reveals that it was intended for her lover who died from a disease contracted at the front after having been conscripted to China. In a further revelation, we learn that this man is in fact the true father of Akio and Harume. The next morning, it has snowed and Harume is singing a children‚Äôs song reminiscent of her childhood in Kanazawa. We learn that she is mentally handicapped, that her mind is like that of a child and that she cannot care for herself. After a banquet dinner that evening, Ibuki returns with Yasuko and Mieko to the Togano household. He finds himself physically drawn to Harume, not yet alert to her disability. On the way home, Ibuki is intercepted by Mikame, who takes him to the hotel suite he uses for his writing. Mikame tells Ibuki that he has uncovered the truth of Mieko‚Äôs past, related to him by her doctor. Before their marriage, Mieko‚Äôs husband, Masatsugu, had installed a maid whom he kept as a mistress at the Togano house. The maid, Aguri, had become pregnant on several occasions but Masatsugu had each time insisted on abortion, much to Aguri‚Äôs distress and displeasure. Driven by jealousy after his marriage to Mieko, Aguri engineered for Mieko to fall down the stairs, causing her to miscarry several months into her own pregnancy. On another instance, during the New Year's holidays, Mikame visits the Ibuki household where he announces that he has proposed to Yasuko. One evening, Mieko attends to Harume‚Äôs toilette and implores her to faithfully execute her ‚Äúplan,\\" as of yet unknown to the reader. Mieko rereads an old letter sent to her by her soldier lover, who expresses his delight at having fathered Akio and Harume and his firm conviction that he shall return to Japan, given his status as a non-combatant. Ibuki visits Yasuko at the Togano household, continuing their series of illicit rendez-vous. In the middle of the night he is perturbed to see before him the face of Harume, apparition- like and resembling the Masugami mask of the young madwoman. In the morning, he relates his suspicions to Yasuko, who dismisses them offhand, likening his confused perception of reality to an episode of the Heian era uta monogatari, The Tales of Ise. Fukai Ibuki and Yasuko continue their nocturnal rendez-vous at the Togano household. Meanwhile, Mikame‚Äôs courtship of Yasuko continues and their various public outings together inspire Ibuki to jealousy. Sadako visits Mikame at his home to reveal that she has hired a private investigator and has it on good authority that her husband and Yasuko are sleeping together. She denounces the Togano household as a ‚Äúwitches‚Äô den‚Äù but is disappointed by Mikame‚Äôs lack of reaction when he remains largely unmoved. Sadako further announces that Harume is pregnant, although she does not know who has fathered the child. Mieko takes Harume, now three months pregnant, to the hospital. The doctor recommends abortion since Harume has a severely retroflexed womb and cannot be expected to survive childbirth. Mieko, however, ignores his advice, for she is intent on continuing her family line and producing a child bearing the same blood as her beloved son, Akio. Ibuki learns of the child he has fathered and, for the first time, of Harume‚Äôs mental deficiencies. He once more glimpses Harume, heavy with child, at a temple on the outskirts of Kyoto. At a meeting of her poetry circle some months later, Mieko is presented with the gift of a noh mask from the old master visited in the first part of the book, now deceased. The mask is Fukai, that of an older woman withered with age and visibly marked by the deep emotions of one well advanced in years. We learn that Harume indeed died of heart failure shortly after the birth as the Togano maid, Y≈´, and then Yasuko cradle the child in their arms. The novel closes with Mieko reflecting upon the Fukai mask when suddenly she is struck by some unseen, supernatural power.

Romano (born February 4, 1969), is an Italian and American international law scholar, known as an authority on international law, international courts, and international human rights. He is a Professor of Law at Loyola Law School Los Angeles.  Early life  Cesare Romano is the son of Tullio Romano, an Italian pop-star of the 1960s, member of the Los Marcellos Ferial . He grew up between Milan, Italy, where he was schooled, and Vienna, Austria, where his mother's family lives.  Career  Between 1988 and 1992, he studied Political Science at the University of Milan, where he graduated (Laurea) with the highest grades, with a thesis on Public International Law on Compliance Control under the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. His thesis director was Giorgio Sacerdoti. After receiving his degree, Prof. Romano studied for a year at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), in Milan, preparing for the admission test to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1993, he moved to Geneva, to study at the Graduate Institute of International Studies. In 1995, he obtained the Dipl√¥me d‚Äô√âtudes Sup√©rieures (DES) with specialization in International Law. He was given full scholarship to continue studying towards a Ph.D., which he completed in 1999, on the Peaceful Settlement of International Environmental Disputes, which he successfully defended before Lucius Caflisch, Georges Abi- Saab and Pierre-Marie Dupuy. In 1996, he moved to New York City, to study at New York University School of Law. He graduated from NYU with an LLM in International Legal Studies. During the first few days of his stay at NYU he was offered by Shepard Forman to join the then-soon-to-be Center on International Cooperation (CIC). At CIC, Cesare Romano launched PICT - the Project on International Courts and Tribunals, a joint undertaking of CIC and the Foundation for International Environmental Law and Development (FIELD), at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and, since 2002, the Faculty of Laws of the Centre for International Courts and Tribunals, at University College London, collaborating with Philippe Sands and Ruth Mackenzie. PICT was a pioneering project, which changed the well-settled field of the study of international dispute settlement. \\"PICT‚Äôs main contribution to the field has been to look at specific international adjudicative bodies as the pieces of a larger whole ‚Äîan emerging international judiciary, with much in common and much to learn from each other‚Äî rather than as separate institutions, as had been done hitherto. PICT‚Äôs website provided the first portal through which newcomers could learn about each and every international judicial body, providing scholars data to start making comparisons across the board‚Äù. Romano's activities at PICT were funded by William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, John & Catherine MacArthur Foundation, and the Ford Foundation. In 2006, Prof. Romano joined Loyola Law School Los Angeles, receiving tenure in 2009. In 2011, he founded at Loyola Law School Los Angeles the International Human Rights Clinic. He has litigated of dozens of cases before the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights and specialized United Nations human rights bodies, including the Human Rights Committee; the Committee of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; the Committee of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; prepared amici curiae briefs for the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and several domestic courts; prepared shadow reports for the United Nations Universal Periodic Review and the periodic reports on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Awarded by the University of Milan  Publications  Prof. Dr. Romano has authored 8 books, 21 articles and papers and 27 contributions to collective works. Several of Romano's works have been acclaimed as innovative and ground breaking, stirring debate, nationally and internationally.  Peaceful Settlement of International Environmental Disputes  Romano's Ph.D. dissertation was published by Kluwer in 2000 under the title \\"The Peaceful Settlement of International Environmental Disputes: A Pragmatic Approach\\". In his \\"authoritative and comprehensive\\" book, Romano argues that arbitration is a more effective means to settle international environmental disputes that resort to judicial bodies, like the International Court of Justice. \\"Romano eschews traditional explanations of the process by which nations settle these disputes in this important, comprehensive and very readable book that surveys and review the classic conflicts of international environmental law\\".  The International Judge  Romano co-authored the book with Daniel Terris, an historian, and Leigh Swigart, an anthropologist, directors of the International Center for Ethics, Justice and Public Life of Brandeis University. The book was forwarded by Justice Sonya Sotomayor, of the United States Supreme Court. In her preface, Sotomayor wrote \\"A proposed bill in Congress to prohibit the citation of foreign law in federal judicial decisions gave rise in recent years to a heated and extensive dialogue among American judges, academics, and commentators on the appropriate role that foreign and international law should play in American constitutional adjudication. But the question of how much we have to learn from foreign law and the international community in interpreting our Constitution is not the only one worth posing. As The International Judge makes clear, we should also question how much we have to learn from international courts and from their men and women judges about judging and the factors outside of the law that influence our decisions. This book makes an invaluable contribution to efforts to answer that question by laying bare the institutional, political, moral, ethical, and legal concerns that animate the work of international courts and their judges\\". Sotomayor wrote this preface when she was still a Federal Judge on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. During confirmation hearings for her appointment at the U.S. Supreme Court, her preface was used by conservatives to question her suitability for the position.  The United States and International Courts and Tribunals  The Sword and the Scales: The United States and International Courts and Tribunals, Cambridge University Press, 2009. \\"The Sword and the Scales ... is one of the first systematic treatments of the United States‚Äô engagement with international courts and tribunals. With a star-studded cast of contributors, this volume proposes nothing less than ... offering a ‚Äòcorrelation and causation‚Äô between the rise of the US as a superpower and the ‚Äòjudicialization‚Äô of international relations (p. xiv), the ‚Äòfirst comprehensive look at U.S. attitudes toward a very large range of judicial and ‚Ä¶ quasi-judicial international institutions and procedures‚Äô (p. xvi)\\". The book features a heated debate between Romano and John Bellinger III, the Legal Adviser for the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration, over the attitude the United States should have toward international courts and tribunals.  International adjudication  Romano C./Alter K./Shany Y. (eds.), The Oxford University Press Handbook of International Adjudication, 2014. ‚ÄúThe Oxford Handbook emerges as an indispensable resource for all those interested in international adjudication. It represents the distillation and refinement of great debates in the area and accommodates a diversity of approaches, ranging from the extremely pragmatic, to the forensically descriptive, to the lofty and theoretical.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe approach taken in the Oxford Handbook is unusually taxonomic: it aspires to provide a comprehensive resource that describes the plethora of existing institutions and the debates that are associated with them, whilst simultaneously seeking to constitute itself as a repository of contemporary practice and challenges facing international adjudication.

History   The beginning  Mesbla Building In the building number 83 of the Assembleia street, in the city center of Rio de Janeiro, was installed in 1912 a subsidiary of the firm Mestre & Blatg√©, based in Paris and specialized in the trading of machinery and equipment. The Brazilian subsidiary had little importance within the French organization throughout the world. Four years after its installation, its administration was handed over to French Louis La Saigne, previously deputy manager of the branch in Buenos Aires. In 1924, La Saigne transformed the Rio establishment in an autonomous firm, with the name Sociedade An√¥nima Brasileira Estabelecimentos Mestre et Blatg√©, which in 1939 changed its name to Mesbla S.A. The new name was a combination of the first syllables of the original name, which was suggested by the secretary of Louis La Saigne, Isaura, through an internal competition. The concern was that at the beginning of World War II France has expressed solidarity to Adolf Hitler, which could lead to reprisals in Brazil with reference to the name. La Saigne had four daughters, and the oldest married Henrique de Botton. After a day of hard work, Louis La Saigne, the founder of Mesbla, died at his residence on the night of January 18, 1961. With his death were elected president and vice president two of his older employees, respectively, Silvano Santos Cardoso and Henrique de Botton. In the following year, on August 12, 1962, Mesbla celebrated its Golden Jubilee already as a genuinely Brazilian company, with more than 8 000 employees operating in 13 branches, retail stores and sales agencies established in strategic parts of the country. After the death of Silvano Santos Cardoso on February 29, 1968, Henrique became president, and after Henrique's death, his son Andr√© also took office. Both led the expansion and the decline of the company until the 1980s. In the 1950s, the company had stores located in major cities in the country and in some countryside towns. In the 1980s Mesbla had 180 outlets and employed 28 000 people. Their large stores, with areas with rarely less than 3 000 square meters, were landmarks in the cities where Mesbla was present. For nearly three decades reigned virtually alone in the retail market, being the only company in the genre with nationwide coverage. Employees took pride in stating that Mesbla just did not sell coffins, which are for the dead; for the living they had all the goods, from buttons to cars, boats and airplanes.  Reformulation in the 1980s  However, the expansion of Mesbla was made with market strategies that soon proved to be outdated. When it decided to increase the sale of clothing and bed and table linen, the articles were exposed next to machines and equipment, traditional goods of the company. The same disorganized mixture was seen in catalogs. Also the company purchases from suppliers had failures. For example, as soon as the Brazil resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, in the government of Jo√£o Goulart, Mesbla imported from that country a large quantity of cameras and low-quality video cameras. As imports did not have continuity, Mesbla found itself in difficulties to provide technical assistance for the goods sold. The red light came in 1981, when the Mesbla went from the first to the third place between the largest retail companies in Brazil and started to face a stronger competition. A marketing consulting firm was hired, and Mesbla stores have undergone a complete overhaul, with changes in the decoration of shops, arrangement of windows, salespeople uniforms and customer communication. It also started to take better care of advertising, presenting catalogs in color and well maintained ads for television. Attracted the best executives in the market, offering good salaries. In addition to department stores, it had its own premises for sale of furniture, cars, boats, and a financial institution. It also worked in international trade through a subsidiary company, which had a branch in New York City. Among the several million-dollar deals made by Mesbla International Trade, one was highlighted even in The New York Times: the selling of 60 000 trucks to China, a deal that worthed 900 million dollars. In 1986 it was chosen by the magazine Exame, specialized in economics and business, as the best company in Brazil. Andr√© de Botton was consecrated as the retail king. His name was part of the quartet that formed the corporate nobility of the 1970s and 1980s, supplemented by Octavio Lacombe, from the Paranapanema Group, Olavo Monteiro de Carvalho, from Monteiro Aranha and Augusto Trajano, from Caemi. In addition to offices of large corporations and the offices of ministers and politicians in Brasilia, they circulated the spheres of Rio de Janeiro high society of the time. De Botton was chosen twice as the Foreign Retailer of the Year by the American organization National Retail Federation.  Problems in the 1990s  Despite these strategy changes, some problems persisted. Mesbla had forty directors, making the decisions slow. At the end of the Sarney administration in 1989, the board, believing that the country was heading to an hyperinflation, began to stock excess goods and basically relied on funds generated by its financial institute. The advent of the Plano Real, with the end of high inflation, showed the weaknesses of Mesbla, and the company began to face constant losses, which it tried to solve with closing stores and dismissal of employees. Compounding, it had to face competition from foreign department stores and hypermarkets, with ease of raising capital abroad at lower interest rates. Foreign companies conquered the clientele with better purchasing power, always attentive to news, with a greater variety of goods and installment credit facilities, in particular with the creation of own credit cards. When Mesbla tried to match with the competitors, creating unique brands of clothes and its own credit card, it was too late. In the year 1994 it had closed several stores and reduced its staff to 4 500 employees, unable to stem the losses.  Mansur and the end  In 1997, with debts of more than one billion reais, it filed for bankruptcy. In the same year, the shareholder control of Mesbla was acquired by the businessman Ricardo Mansur, who scooped 51% of the shares by 600 million reais, to be paid in ten years, and taking the tax debt of 350 million reais of the bankrupt. Nine months before he had bought the Mappin stores, traditional S√£o Paulo state retail company. He intended to merge the two companies, making them profitable and resell them with profit. Controversial businessman, Mansur, owner of dairy companies and a bank, was known both for his aggressive style as for his taste for ostentation. He maintains a mansion in London, where sponsors a polo team, to which he provides thoroughbred horses of his own creation. To fulfill the wishes of a daughter, he commissioned from a renowned architect from S√£o Paulo a dollhouse, worth 300 000 dollars, which was installed on his farm in Indaiatuba. In an attempt to save the Mesbla and Mappin, Mansur put companies ahead of the executive Jo√£o Paulo Amaral. But Jo√£o Paulo soon realized that he was on one of those missions regarded as impossible. The lack of money was more serious than previously thought; the delays in the payment of suppliers, chronic. Then began a series of bankruptcy filings, and eviction threats in every mall where the shops displayed their brands. Mansur tried to use his influence with the politicians and even the pressure of the Mesbla and Mappin employees, through marches, to get money from the Brazilian Development Bank, a public bank. At the same time, he sought some foreign group interested in acquiring the stores. His credibility, however, began to be questioned when he began to spread false information to complete the deal. At the same time, the administration of his bank began to be investigated and fraudulent practices have been qualified, which resulted in its liquidation. Because of these practices, Mansur was arrested and had his assets blocked. A new arrest warrant was made by his ex-wife, for who he did not pay child support. With so many problems, Mansur lost interest in the fate of Mesbla and Mappin. He flew to London and never returned to Brazil. The bankruptcy of both companies was enacted in July 1999, and the last Mesbla store to close its doors was the branch of Niter√≥i in August 24, 1999. At the same time, Lojas Brasileiras and G. Aronson ended their activities, two retail companies of national capital. Since then, the Brazilian retail market had to compete with foreign companies. In 2009, it was advertised the comeback of Mesbla: an e-commerce company negotiated the purchase of name usage rights with Mansur and intended to open a site aimed at women in March 2010, with official launch in May of the same year. \\"The brand still has a positive appeal among consumers\\", evaluated a company director. According to columnist M√¥nica Bergamo, in the edition of Folha de S.Paulo of June 3, 2009, the former owner of Mesbla, Ricardo Mansur, would have gone to New York City to accelerate contacts to advance the fastest possible the reopening of Mesbla, however, the initiative did not yield results.

It was originally known as Palmerston Cemetery. The cemetery stands as a testament to the many different cultural groups with different religious affiliations that lived in the early years of the city. Proposed in 1869, when the original survey for a town was conducted, the first burials took place around 1872 or 1873. The cemetery closed in 1919; however, a number of burials were carried out after its closure including people that were associated with the pioneering families. Overall, about 1,230 burials took place, although 450 burials were not recorded by Births, Deaths and Marriages.  History  In February 1869 George Woodroffe Goyder, the Surveyor General, and a survey team arrived in Port Darwin to survey the new town of Palmerston (now known as Darwin). One of Goyder's tasks was to provide for the first cemetery which included 48 acres. Today, this is from where Graham Street in Stuart Park runs to what is now the Stuart Highway running from about Nylander Street. The occupants of the cemetery include a wide range of people from Darwin and include infants and people from many different cultural backgrounds. This reflects the cultural diversity of the town's early history which included Chinese, Japanese and Malay people. Causes of death of the occupants include suicide, stillbirth and drowning. A school teacher's death was described in the records as \\"visitation from God\\". One of the first occupants is thought to be Charles Harvey, a carpenter, who died on 4 October 1872. Other deaths were soon to follow: in November of the same year trooper William Davies was taken by a crocodile off Lameroo Beach while swimming. Davies was followed by two miners, Robert McCracken and JW Smith, who died in 1873. The cemetery contains many graves of people that helped establish Darwin. This includes the grave of John George Knight, one of the most senior officials in the Northern Territory at the time of his death. There is also a monument to Edward (Ned) Tuckwell, buried in 1882, who along with his wife Eliza were involved in the pre-Darwin settlement at Escape Cliffs. Other prominent pioneering families are also buried in the cemetery including Spain, Brown and Bell. Other significant graves include Paul Foelsche and his wife Charlotte, Foelsche led the Northern Territory Mounted Police and was noted as a recorder of Territory history through his writings and photography. The cemetery's most impressive headstone, in the form of a 1m marble angel, belongs to Thomas Crush, the Territory's first Labour member of Parliament in South Australia and whom along with his wife Fannie (later Haynes) built the Federation Hotel at Brocks Creek. The cemetery also tells the tale of many inhabitants who died tragic deaths. This includes the death of Captain Joe Bradshaw who lost over four hundred thousand pounds in his venture then died of gangrene in 1916, there was Yusumatsu Tokayama who died two months later, most likely of the bends, while working for a pittance as a diver. Other recorded deaths include that of 19-year-old Edith Pater, daughter of Territory's first Judge, who died of tuberculosis. The cemetery became less important after the opening of Gardens Cemetery in 1919, after which time it was closed.  The cemetery today  The cemetery was subject to an inadequate record keeping and documentation, because of this many of the occupants are unknown. Overtime grave markers have disappeared, and some memorials have been destroyed. Today there are about 90 graves still visible. The cemetery is now fenced to protect what remains, and is managed by the City of Darwin who undertook an upgrade project in 1983, one outcome of which was the installation of a plaque that displays some of the locations of graves and occupants. Other upgrades include a memorial plaque to the John Knight Memorial in 2003. Ghost tours are now also carried out in the cemetery. Recent controversy has arisen over rezoning nearby land that nearby residents were concerned could disturb unmarked graves.

Todd previously worked in the Council office of Muriel Bowser and in various campaign positions during her successful campaign for Mayor of the District of Columbia. Todd won a special election in May 2015, succeeding Muriel Bowser, who was elected as mayor. Todd was sworn into office on May 14, 2015, and served the remainder of Bowser's term. He won the June 2016 Democratic primary and the November 2016 general election, and lost the 2020 Democratic primary to Janeese Lewis George. His term expires on January 2, 2021. Early life and education  Todd was born on May 26, 1983, and raised in Washington, D.C. He graduated from Eastern High School and has a communications degree from Bowie State University and a Master in Business Administration from Trinity Washington University. In 2005, while in college, Todd declared bankruptcy for more than $20,000 in unpaid debts. His creditors were primarily credit card companies, with charges from clothing retailers. Todd joined the Democratic Party in October 2007 after voting in five elections as a member of the Republican Party. Pre-Council Career In 2012, Todd managed Bowser's campaign for reelection as Ward 4 Councilmember. He served as Bowser's director of constituent services. In the same year, Todd was elected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention representing Wards 3, 4, 5, and 7. In March 2013, Todd coordinated a construction job fair for workers skilled in mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete, rough carpentry, masonry, roofing, and waterproofing in Fort Totten Square. On June 5, 2013, Todd was elected chair of the Ward 4 Democrats. He launched a new web site and Twitter account for the organization. In 2014, he was Finance Director for Bowser's mayoral campaign. Electoral history 2014 special election On December 4, 2014, Todd announced his candidacy for councilmember for Ward 4 after the position was vacated when Bowser was elected mayor. Within three days of his announcement, Todd had raised $50,000. In the final campaign finance filing before the election, Todd had three times the financial reserves of his nearest rival. Todd accepted donations from LLCs owned by companies, which allowed companies to donate additional money to the campaign. Todd advertised his close relationship with the mayor, saying he was the only candidate in the field who would be able to pick up the phone and discuss the ward's needs directly with her. At a debate, it was reported that Todd searched on Google when asked to name a historical figure whose leadership he admired. His campaign had no comment on the action. Todd won with 42% of the vote. 2016 general election Todd speaking in 2017 In the June 14, 2016 D.C Council Ward 4 Democratic primary election, Todd won with 49% of the vote. He received the endorsements of the Gertrude Stein Democratic Club, Democrats for Education Reform, and The Washington Post. Todd won reelection for a full four-year term in the general election on November 8, 2016. He garnered 35,100 votes. District of Columbia Board of Elections. Nov 18, 2016.  2020 primary election  Todd lost the June 2020 primary election to progressive activist and former D.C. Assistant Attorney General Janeese Lewis George, a self-described democratic socialist, 7,926 to 6,386 votes. Council terms First (partial) council term During his campaign, Todd said that he opposed awarding the operation of DC's prisons to a controversial private management company. After his election, Todd said that the Council should not be involved in awarding the contract. While campaigning, Todd was one of the few candidates who did not oppose pop-ups, or housing extensions above the original height. After winning office and in the wake of community protests, he said he was \\"not outright opposed to pop-ups but that he wanted to find a balance between new housing units and neighbors' concerns.\\" In 2016, amid community opposition Todd announced his support for Mayor Bowser's plan to open a homeless shelter in Ward 4, hoping that it would be used as a catalyst for economic development. After a building was condemned in Ward 4 and its residents forced to vacate the property, Todd was described as not helpful. A spokesperson for Todd said he was aware of the condemnation. In April 2017, the DC Auditor announced that it was conducting an investigation into the financing of Todd's 2015 special election campaign. As a result, Todd was fined $5,100 dollars by the office of campaign finance, which he paid in-full. Todd was unable to substantiate donations of over $100,000 and failed to report $34,000 in donations. While the investigation was underway during the 2016 general election, it was not disclosed. On November, 2017, Todd supported legislation that would jump-start economic development and revitalization along the Kennedy Street Corridor. Second council term Todd was sworn into office for a full four-year council term at noon on January 2, 2017. On January 20, 2017, Todd joined Councilmembers Jack Evans and Anita Bonds, as well as Mayor Muriel Bowser at the parade for the inauguration of Donald Trump, saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that we get to know the Trump administration and they get to know the District. And the first step in that is being here for a peaceful transition of power.‚Äù Todd supported the modernization of West Elementary School during the Fiscal Year 2018 budget negotiations. When anti-immigrant flyers were spread around Ward 4, Todd stated that \\"Xenophobic and hostile flyers will not be tolerated. All residents, regardless of race, color, creed, religious affiliation or sexual preference, deserve to feel safe and respected in their community.\\" On September 19, 2017, Todd introduced the ‚ÄúUniversal Free Lunch for All Amendment Act of 2017,‚Äù which would provide lunch for all students in District of Columbia public schools, public charter schools, and participating private schools free of charge. On October 3, 2017, Todd helped secure passage of the ‚ÄúStandard of Care for Animals Amendment Act of 2017,‚Äù a comprehensive animal welfare bill to protect the health and safety of District animals. On December 4, 2017, Todd Introduced a bill to strengthen identity theft protections for children and eliminate credit freeze fees for all District residents. The ‚ÄúIdentity Protection Amendment Act of 2017‚Äù would enable a parent or guardian of a child to place a credit freeze on their behalf. The legislation was developed in concert with the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, (OAG). It builds on similar emergency legislation introduced by OAG and temporarily passed into law after the Equifax data breach. On December 5, 2017, Todd secured passage of his ‚ÄúOffice on African American Affairs Establishment Act of 2017,‚Äù legislatively creating an office with grant-making authority to develop, implement, and support policies and programs for African American advancement in the District of Columbia. Todd introduced legislation that would create an Office of Nightlife to act as a liaison between government, community leaders and business owners to ensure that all residents benefit from the proliferation of bars, restaurants and entertainment venues in the nation's capitol in recent years. The bill received support from both the business community and community leaders. Todd was active in responding to widespread reports from Ward 4 residents about Metro trains vibrating their homes. He sent three separate letters to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority General Manager over the course of a year to solicit more information and ask for expedited progress. Todd supported campaign finance reform by voting in favor of the \\"Fair Elections Act of 2017\\". In 2018, Todd was the sole Councilmember who opposed providing subpoena power to the Committee on Health to investigate Veritas, a politically connected DC contractor charged with management of the United Medical Center. Concerns about patient safety and charges of mismanagement at UMC prompted the inquiry. The CEO of Veritas donated $6,000 to Brandon Todd's campaign. Todd was one of the council members who overturned the raise of the minimum wage for tipped workers that voters passed in a 2018 ballot but which the council repealed before it went into effect, and this would become a significant issue in his 2020 defeat in the democratic primary. Campaign finance controversy As a result of an audit of his 2015 campaign in April 2017, Todd was fined $5,100 dollars by the Office of Campaign Finance, which he paid in-full. After Todd's 2015 special election win, the District government's Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) audited the Todd campaign as part of its regular after-election audit of all campaigns. The audit, completed in early January 2016, discovered that the campaign failed to report more than $34,000 in contributions. The campaign also received more than $69,000 in contributions for which it had no records indicating who made the donation. For reasons which remain unclear, the OCF agreed to keep its preliminary audit confidential until the 2015 Todd special election campaign answered the report's allegations. According to the OCF, the 2015 Todd campaign repeatedly declined to provide it with the information and answers it sought, even as Todd campaigned for a full, four- year term on the council during a hotly contest June 14, 2016, Democratic primary. Todd's 2015 campaign staff said they provided all the information the OCF asked for, but the OCF's \\"antiquated\\" technology was unable to accept or integrate the information. OCF found the campaign failed to adequately document another $100,000 in contributions. Todd won the June 14 primary with 49 percent of the vote, without voters knowing about the report's preliminary findings. His closest challenger, Leon T. Andrews, Jr., had 40.8 percent. Todd was unopposed in the general election. Once more, voters remained in the dark about the report's finding. On April 7, 2017, about 16 months after the preliminary report was issued, The Washington Post made the report's draft findings public. The Washington Post reported on April 17, 2017 that 136 contributors to Todd's 2016 reelection campaign could not be identified by name. The donors contributed about $18,000 to the 2016 effort. Another 1,200 of the 1,400 contributors to the campaign provided no employer information, as required by law. OCF had previously identified more than $7,000 in contributions to Todd's 2016 campaign which were illegal or questionable under D.C. campaign finance laws, and the Todd campaign returned those donations. However, About $5,000 in donations were over the legal limit of $500 per individual or business. The 2016 reelection campaign accepted these donations, and did not return them. OCF officials said they had previously identified numerous questionable donations and expenditures by the Todd 2016 reelection campaign, but many of these had been resolved and the agency was still in the process of obtaining more information. Personal life Todd lives in the Petworth neighborhood of Ward 4 and attends St. Mary's Episcopal Church. He is single.

Release and promotion Run the Jewels, as part of the original album release, offered a series of absurd \\"deluxe releases\\" for large sums of money, parodying indulgent \\"stretch goals\\" offered on crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter. One of the less expensive of these was the group creating a remix album using cat sounds; a group of fans launched an online campaign to raise the money to pay the group the requested $40,000 to do this. The campaign in fact raised over $60,000, which Run the Jewels announced that the duo would be donating to charity. Several other record producers announced that they would be contributing to the remixes, including Just Blaze, Prince Paul, The Alchemist, Geoff Barrow, Dan the Automator and Boots, among others.

Using the framework of his own desire to have a limousine drive him to and from his job at NBC, the network which broadcasts the program, Franken attacked network president Fred Silverman for NBC's poor showing in the Nielsen ratings during his tenure. It has been called \\"one of the meanest acts of character assassination in‚Äîwell, the history of mean acts of character assassination.\\" Silverman, who had not been informed of the commentary beforehand due to a series of communication failures, was furious. He believed that SNL producer Lorne Michaels, who was in the midst of negotiating a new contract, had orchestrated it as revenge for Silverman's failure to attend a meeting with Michaels to discuss those talks the previous day. After hundreds of letters and postcards were delivered to Silverman's office the following Monday, he refused to accept a letter of apology offered by Franken, whom he said later he had never liked to begin with. The commentary, and Silverman's reaction to it, had several effects on the show. Michaels and many of the people associated with the show were emotionally exhausted after five seasons, and he had planned for almost everyone to take some time off. Since the show had been one of NBC's few successes under Silverman, the network wanted it to continue that fall. Franken and his writing partner Tom Davis, with Michaels' support, had expressed interest in producing the show while Michaels served as its executive producer. NBC executives were also hoping they could persuade Michaels to stay, an option he was still open to if the contractual provisions he wanted were offered. After Franken's commentary, he and Davis lost any chance they had had of succeeding Michaels as producer. NBC also assumed Michaels was not interested in continuing and began making plans for a future SNL without him. This led to Jean Doumanian, one of the show's associate producers from its inception but never involved in the writing process, being hired to replace Michaels, a decision kept from him since he believed any new producer should have been involved in the writing aspect of the show. She oversaw a wholesale replacement of the cast and writing staff, and was fired before the end of the next season, called the worst in the show's history by author Brian Finamore. Background In spring 1980, Michaels and Saturday Night Live on the one side, and Silverman and NBC on the other, were in drastically different positions. Lorne Michaels and SNL By its fifth season, SNL was an unqualified success. It had made stars of its cast members and spawned blockbuster movies, hit singles and many lines of merchandise. Two of those stars, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, had left. But all the show's other repertory cast members remained, and midway through the season Harry Shearer was promoted from featured player status to replace them, although he soon alienated his colleagues with his attitude.Hill and Weingrad, Ch. 28 Many of the show's writers, who had long been playing minor roles in sketches, including Al Franken and his longtime partner Tom Davis, were in turn named as featured players. But behind the scenes many of the cast and crew had grown weary of the show. Their celebrity status led them to keep company with each other, and other celebrities who they had become friends with, so that they would not be mobbed as they often were in public by fans who asked them the same questions over and over. Increasing cocaine use, particularly the addictions of Garrett Morris and Laraine Newman, had exacerbated existing interpersonal friction, and stories of egotistical behavior by the stars began to reach the media. Producer Lorne Michaels had felt it necessary to bring the staff up to Mohonk Mountain House in the Hudson Valley for a weekend retreat before the season, the first time that had been necessary, which the senior cast members declined to attend. Competing network ABC had also started a competing sketch-comedy show called Fridays, putting further pressure on Michaels (who was incensed that it was produced by two other clients of his manager, Bernie Brillstein), the cast and crew. Hanging over the show was the question of whether Michaels would renew his contract and continue the show for another season. Many of the cast and crew did not want him to. \\"Everyone was looking beyond the show,\\" recalled writer Alan Zweibel. Critics complained that, in the absence of its two biggest stars, the show had become less creative, and Lorne joked to the media that that had been his intention all along. \\"[It]'s going get worse and worse, and eventually it will never be funny again.\\" By Christmas 1979, Michaels' assistant Cherie Fortis said, \\"everyone just said 'OK, let's get through the rest of this.' People were praying Lorne wouldn't come back. We were waiting for it to end.\\"Hill and Weingrad, Ch. 32. Fred Silverman and NBC Michaels' return did not seem likely. From the beginning of his tenure at NBC, Silverman had been convinced that a weekday variety show starring Gilda Radner, who he saw as the next Lucille Ball, could be a hit. Michaels was less certain. Radner told NBC executives she could not do two series at once and did not want to leave her SNL castmates behind. In November 1979, two weeks after Michaels‚Äîwho had lost his most important ally at the network when Silverman's predecessor Herb Schlosser, an early supporter of SNL, left‚Äîstated his refusal clearly and definitely, Silverman called him to his office once again to try to persuade him to do it. The meeting ended in a shouting match, and Silverman's already somewhat negative view of Michaels became much more severe. Michaels and Radner's aversion to a weekly show, however, did not prevent them from mounting a one-woman Broadway show, later filmed as Gilda Live. While SNL, despite its internal conflicts, was still successful, NBC was not. Shows like The Tonight Show (itself embroiled in a contract dispute with host Johnny Carson at the same time) were mainstays of the schedule along with SNL, but the network had had very few of the prime time hits it hoped president Fred Silverman, known until then for his apparently unerring instinct in understanding what audiences would watch, would be able to deliver for them as he had for ABC and CBS earlier in the decade. NBC's weak ratings position was aggravated in early 1980 by its shaky finances‚Äîa loss of millions in broadcast fees when President Jimmy Carter decided to boycott that year's Summer Olympics in Moscow in order to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the preceding fall, and the failure of Supertrain in spring of 1979, the most expensive series in television history at that point, had pushed the network to the verge of bankruptcy. From the beginning of his tenure at NBC, John Belushi had played Silverman in a series of sketches. While Silverman himself was not fond of them, he knew better than to intervene in one of his network's few hits. He also said later that despite his antipathy, he recognized that Belushi was a talented performer and the impersonation got laughs. In the spring of 1980, Michaels began renegotiating his contract. Believing that NBC would, as it had four years earlier, take over Studio 8H, where the show was staged, for coverage of that year's presidential elections, his hope was for a later start to the season, to give everyone a bit more time to rest. When it returned he wanted to totally restructure it, probably with a new cast, and would have filled the role of executive producer, since he had signed a three- picture deal with Warner Brothers, leaving the duties he had handled for the previous five seasons to someone else, possibly Franken and Davis. Most of the cast and crew had wanted to just end the show, but admitted that if Michaels had wanted to continue they would have done so with him. He also had some ideas for side projects, such as Yesterday, a half-hour version of Weekend Update that would air late on weekday nights (an idea soon abandoned when Johnny Carson, in his contract, effectively got the right to approve any show that came on after his; Carson had never been a great fan of SNL's style of humor). May 8 meeting On May 8, 1980, Michaels and Brillstein had scheduled an afternoon meeting with Silverman and other network executives. Michaels had previously made clear to the network that he was amenable to staying, even at the same salary, as long as the network accommodated his request for a later start to the season, the restructuring of the show, and technical improvements to 8H. Rather than haggle with the network, he had told the executives to get back to him with the best counteroffer they could put together within 24 hours. Silverman had been up all the previous night putting together the network's fall schedule so he could present it to the network affiliates' board of governors that morning. That meeting had not gone well; many of the affiliates were disappointed with NBC's performance under Silverman, and some of them were openly talking about changing their affiliation. Silverman skipped the afternoon meeting; Brillstein and Michaels were told only that he was ill, and felt disrespected. That feeling of disrespect was further intensified by their interactions with the NBC executives who were at the meeting. Irwin Moss, the network's vice president for business affairs, began by noting the $2.5 million NBC had paid, sight unseen, for the broadcast rights to Gilda Live, which had failed commercially and critically. \\"So, you're here to gouge us again?\\" he joked. Brillstein did not think that was funny. Moss then pulled out a copy of Michaels' most recent contract, and asked him what he wanted. Another shouting match, between Brillstein and Moss, ensued. Both Brillstein and Michaels were stunned by how poorly the executives had prepared themselves. They finally left after Moss refused to commit to anymore than six episodes of a possible prime time series; Brillstein and Michaels had wanted 17. Afterwards, Michaels was convinced his relationship with NBC was, at this point in time, over. \\"They would have had to make me feel special [to come back], and they didn't,\\" he recalled years later. The next day, Silverman called and apologized for his absence, and rescheduled the meeting for the following Monday. He and Lorne met by themselves that afternoon. Silverman offered Michaels more money, primetime shows, anything he wanted, as long as he'd stay at least nominally involved with Saturday Night Live. Commentary Franken's was not the first Weekend Update commentary that season to be a self-serving personal attack. Just before Christmas Bill Murray, who had felt abandoned when Aykroyd and Belushi left, leaving the show overly reliant on him for the first half of the season, had used the critical and commercial failure of 1941, Belushi and Aykroyd's first post-SNL film, to taunt them. Murray deliberately misremembered the film's title, and noted that stars Carrie Fisher and Christopher Lee had previously been on the show. \\"If you ask me they should never have left,\\" he said. \\"They wouldn't listen and now they have this Christmas turkey on their hands. And now my two old friends are going to have the most miserable Christmas of their lives.\\" He ended by recommending audiences instead go see Meatballs, his film debut from that summer.Hill and Weingrad, Ch. 30 Shortly before dress rehearsal the next evening for the season's antepenultimate show hosted by Bob Newhart, Barbara Gallagher, NBC vice president for late-night and special programming, who had worked for Silverman at ABC as well, was perusing the scripts for that evening's show when she came across Franken's commentary for that night's Weekend Update, where he had increasingly been making appearances that season as the segment's \\"social sciences editor\\", riffing on the concept of the 1980s as the \\"Al Franken Decade\\" that he had introduced a few months earlier with the end of the 1970s \\"Me Decade\\". In this evening's installment, Franken recounted how, earlier in the week, he had just come up with a great idea for the show while hailing a taxi outside Rockefeller Center when a fan interrupted him, and he forgot it. This led him to wonder why he didn't get limousine service from NBC, while Silverman did, since Franken was on a hit show while the network had done nothing but flounder under Silverman. Knowing how bad the last two days had been for her boss, Gallagher groaned, knowing Silverman would not take this well. After dress, where the commentary drew voluminous laughter from the audience, she went to Michaels, who agreed that it might have been too much (he had not thought it funny when Franken read it to him, but allowed it since it only took up two minutes of airtime). He refused to remove it from the show since that was not how he ran things, and suggested she talk to Franken personally. \\"Fred's in a really bad way,\\" she told him, \\"and this is really going to hurt him.\\" She claimed later that Franken responded \\"Good, because he hurt Lorne.\\" Michaels assured Gallagher and Brandon Tartikoff, NBC vice president for comedy programming, who was also present, that Franken would nevertheless comply with her request and tone the commentary down. Lorne suggested that they still might want to warn Silverman that the attack was coming, as the show had done in past seasons with the Belushi sketches. But whereas in those situations one of Michaels' assistants had called one of Silverman's, on a Saturday night the only way to warn Silverman would have been to call him at his own home and speak to him personally, which neither of them did. Michaels believed that both Gallagher and Tartikoff were afraid to talk to Silverman, who as the pressures on him increased with NBC's failures had been screaming at his subordinates more and more frequently. When the segment actually aired, it was apparent that Franken had responded to Gallagher's plea by making the criticism of Silverman even harsher. Beginning as he had by moving from the \\"Al Franken Decade\\" to his travails while hailing the cab, he then moved to noting who else at NBC got their own limousines‚Äîother members of the show's cast and stars of other shows like Gary Coleman and Tom Snyder. He felt criticizing anyone in the first group would be \\"petty\\" and \\"taste aside\\", he understood the latter two. Franken went on to ask the audience to mail in postcards to Silverman's office asking that he \\"Get Al Franken A Limo\\". \\"If enough of you write, Silverman will have to give me the limo.\\" he continued. \\"Even though I've just decimated him, that's the way things are around here. He's timid, indecisive and easily pressured! He's weak!\\" The address flashed on the screen once again. Franken signed off, and Jane Curtin ended the segment, sending the show to a commercial. Aftermath The commentary drew as many laughs as it had in dress rehearsal. It had barely ended when, Warren Littlefield later recalled, an NBC page came up to Tartikoff and told him he had a phone call. \\"Who is it?\\" the executive asked. \\"A screaming Mr. Silverman\\" responded the page. Tartikoff asked the page if he had told Silverman whether he knew where Tartikoff was. \\"No,\\" the page answered, \\"we were just told to find you.\\" Tartikoff then told the page to say that he couldn't be found. \\"He just couldn't take Fred screaming at him at that hour,\\" Littlefield recalled. \\"We always thought that was a wonderful lesson that Brandon was imparting to us about survival in the executive ranks.\\" Silverman thought that Michaels had deliberately allowed Franken's attack on him to air as retaliation for the missed Thursday meeting. Reflecting on the episode later, Michaels said that allegation was difficult to respond to \\"What are you going to say‚Äîthat it wasn't me? Then he'd think I was such a wuss that I'd allow Al Franken to just steamroll me against my own career instincts.\\" But he agreed too much damage had been done to easily undo. \\"The upshot of it all was that Fred took it personally, and that put a further strain on the relations between him and me, and we never did meet.\\" \\"I don't think Lorne put the sketch in there to be mean,\\" Silverman said, also with years of reflection. \\"He never did a sketch to be mean. That was not his style. I never did blame Lorne personally.\\" Instead of the meeting the two had originally planned, the event of Monday in Silverman's office was the arrival of approximately 5,000 letters and postcards in response to Franken's plea. This further infuriated the executive, and it was suggested that Franken apologize, which he did by internal memorandum. \\"I did not intend to hurt or offend you with this, admittedly, frontal attack.\\" Instead, Franken urged Silverman to see how he had intended the piece, characterizing it as \\"brazen small guy attacks the boss.\\" He asked that Silverman \\"step back and think of the Fred Silverman I talked about as 'the boss' instead of as Fred Silverman, your mother's son, your wife's husband and your children's father.\\" He believed it actually made NBC and Silverman look good as \\"even the most pointed criticism was allowed on the air by the network and by you, the boss.\\" Franken further implored Silverman not to blame Lorne, who often allowed material on the show that he himself did not personally see the humor of in the name of creative freedom. Silverman was unmoved. \\"I never liked Al Franken to begin with\\" he admitted later. \\"I thought this piece [he] did was just very mean-spirited and not very funny.\\" He recalled writing back to Franken, saying that \\"in no uncertain terms that I thought that what he did was way off base and that I wasn't going to forget it.\\" June 2 meeting Tartikoff told Michaels afterwards that Franken had lost any chance of succeeding him. But he continued to hold out the hope that Michaels himself might yet be persuaded to return in some capacity, as he had suggested he might. The season finale, two weeks later, did little to foster those hopes. While host Buck Henry, doing that duty for what turned out to be the last time, emphatically denied (to loud applause) that the show was ending and even paraded a purported \\"new cast\\" (actually longtime backstage crewmembers) across the stage during his opening monologue, the end sent a different message, as the \\"On Air\\" sign outside the studio, the show's traditional final shot, flickered and then darkened. Michaels had also left all the castmembers a gift, a cigarette lighter shaped like the 30 Rock building where the show was produced, inscribed with \\"Nice working with you 1975‚Äì1980\\". He had never done that in previous seasons.Hill and Weingrad, Ch. 33. Whatever message Michaels was sending, the network very much wanted the show to continue. Tartikoff and Gallagher met with Michaels for the last time at the beginning of June. All the producer would promise was that \\"even if I don't come back, I'll do my very best to make sure the show doesn't fall apart.\\" They assumed that meant he had no one in mind beyond Franken and Davis, both now off the list, to succeed him that he would recommend. However, he had also made it known that he felt any replacement producer had to be a writer, because he believed that in comedy it took a writer, particularly one with credits, to be able to tell other writers with large egos what was and wasn't funny. Silverman, for his part, had also told his executives that a new producer for SNL had to come from within the group of people already working for the show, as he did not believe an outsider would have credibility with the people Michaels had hired and nurtured. So, during the meeting, it was suggested that longtime associate producer Jean Doumanian, a good friend of Gallagher's, be promoted to the top job. Michaels immediately rejected the idea. Pressed by Gallagher, he explained that Doumanian wasn't a producer, that she had never been part of the show's \\"core team\\", and that nobody who ever had been would work for her. He had also invited her to come work for him if he landed a deal with Paramount Pictures he had been considering. He reminded the two executives that she had never been present for any last-minute meetings held between dress and air. Al Franken in particular disliked Doumanian. She had ostensibly produced a primetime special with Bob and Ray, whose humor was especially adored by many of the SNL writers and performers, earlier that season. On the basis of a small contribution to one sketch, Doumanian had decided to award herself a writers' credit. Franken had seen it and crossed her name out, assuming it was a mistake. She later reinserted it, and when Franken came to her over the apparent mistake, she insisted on taking it.Hill and Weingrad, Ch. 34. Hiring of Jean Doumanian Tartikoff decided there was no chance of persuading Michaels to return. After the meeting, Tartikoff called Allan Katz, a former Laugh-In writer who'd gone on to write and produce for several successful 1970s sitcoms, including M*A*S*H and Rhoda, to see if he was interested. The following day, Katz declined, saying he did not want to make the necessary changes to his lifestyle. Without any other candidates of his own, Tartikoff turned again to Gallagher. She again made the case for her friend Doumanian. Whatever Michaels had said, she told Tartikoff, Doumanian was indeed an important member of the SNL team‚Äîas one of the show's associate producers she knew how the show was put together and run, and she knew enough of the other people to provide the continuity Silverman wanted. The previous year, she had produced a special with Bob and Ray, of whom many of the SNL creative team were fans, that came in under budget,Hill and Weingrad, in their chapter 34, point out that Doumanian's having produced that special did not demonstrate the full skill set Michaels drew upon in producing Saturday Night Live. She had the show's existing writers and production staff at her disposal and did not need to hire anyone; the format was also the same as SNL and the show aired in the same timeslot. \\"That's not producing a show,\\" they quote one of the SNL production staff as saying, \\"that's booking a show.\\" She also received some help from Lorne, who increased the show's budget to compensate for some of her attempts to keep it in the original budget after they caused friction between her and some of the staff; he also helped her reformat the special between dress and air. Gallagher noted. Lastly, since it was likely all or most of the cast would be new, the new producer would need to be good at evaluating new talent‚Äîwhich, she said, Doumanian had been doing already as the show's talent coordinator.Hill and Weingrad also pointed out this job title was misleading. Doumanian had not had any role in assessing or hiring performers or writers; she was the show's \\"talent coordinator\\" in that she took care of the hospitality needs for guest performers, a task it was uniformly acknowledged she had performed extremely well. Tartikoff scheduled a meeting with Doumanian, who had already accepted a job in East Coast production with Paramount, for June 4, two days after the meeting with Michaels. He found her very organized, and very specific about what steps she would take with the show. It was his decision to hire her or not, and he told Gallagher he would. The next day he let Doumanian know the job was hers, but not to tell Michaels yet. Why he told her to remain silent has been a matter of some debate. \\"They didn't want anyone to know, and if Lorne knew, it would have been all over town,\\" Gallagher said later. \\"So that was the reason for not telling him. It wasn't a conspiracy to do anything to Lorne.\\" She also has said that she didn't think Tartikoff, who like herself was under enough emotional stress dealing with Silverman's tirades, had it in him at the time for a similarly angry confrontation with Michaels, who for his part believes that the secrecy suggested that Tartikoff hadn't truly given up on persuading him to return, since that way he could easily have retracted the offer. Michaels learned that Doumanian had been hired to replace him the next day. He had been in Houston at the premiere of Urban Cowboy when Paramount head Barry Diller told him that Doumanian had informed Paramount she would not be able to take the job with the studio since she would be succeeding Michaels as producer of SNL. Very soon afterwards Tartikoff called Michaels himself and confirmed this. \\"Really\\", Michaels told him. \\"That's an interesting choice.\\" He told Tartikoff the network had \\"broken faith\\" with him and that it would regret the decision to replace him with Doumanian, since it would mean a \\"complete break\\" with the old show. Doumanian herself called and apologized, and only then did Michaels learn about the secrecy. \\"That was my moment of growing up,\\" he recalled later, suggesting the talks between her and the network had been going on at the same time he had been imploring her to come to Paramount with him. He was furious at her for what he felt was a betrayal, and the two have reportedly never spoken since. Two weeks later, Michaels signed a one-year \\"holding agreement\\" with NBC, which served mainly to prevent him from going to work for another network so soon, while he started his own production company, Broadway Video. In addition to some nominal development commitments, he had the opportunity to produce a special one-hour Weekend Update for the Saturday before the election. Many of the original writers and performers, including Dan Aykroyd, returned. It was never aired, however, when last-minute schedule changes due to a final presidential debate that week led to Silverman pre-empting it for another special. Departure of writing staff Doumanian had expected to be recasting the show, but to at least keep some of the writers. However, shortly after she took over, all the writers quit. Narratives differ on whether this was on their initiative or Doumanian's. \\"I did want to keep several writers, but I think everybody was advised not to stay on,\\" she recalled. \\"Everybody who said they would stay reneged once word got out.\\"Miller and Shales, 176‚Äì79 But according to Michaels, \\"Jean didn't want them.\\" He believes she especially had it in for the writers, and Franken and Davis and Jim Downey, whom Michaels had wanted to succeed him, in particular. \\"Everyone got a memo from Jean to clear out their offices by July,\\" he claims, likening her to \\"the new broom\\" which, in a common media adage about management changes, \\"sweeps clean\\". \\"For Franken and those guys, it was the first signal they got that they weren't even being considered to stay.\\" So thoroughly did they clean their offices out that, according to Joe Piscopo, one of the new cast members Doumanian hired later, that not even a pencil was left. SNL season 6 Doumanian had to hire an entirely new cast and writing staff in just ten weeks. She also had to cope with the network cutting the show's budget to a third of what it had been the previous season. \\"Any producer who comes in here now is doomed to fail,\\" Gallagher recalls telling her friend. \\"It's not going to work.\\" The show under Doumanian, called Saturday Night Live '80, was indeed seen as a failure. Although she claimed to have understood the writing process due to her participation in meetings on the subject, as Michaels had warned the network, she had a particularly difficult time managing the writers due to her inexperience in that area.Hill and Weingrad, Ch. 35 When it premiered, the reviews were unforgivingHill and Weingrad, Ch. 36 and the ratings began to decline, turning what had been a rare success for NBC into yet another problem area for executives. The season was not a total loss. Joe Piscopo's characters drew genuine laughter from the audience, and over the course of the season Eddie Murphy, whom Doumanian had been persuaded to give a chance to despite reservations about his youth, began to emerge as a star. But in February Charles Rocket, whom she had expected to emerge as the show's star, used the word fuck on air while the cast was trying to fill time at the end of a show. Two weeks later, when Bill Murray became the first member of the old cast to host the new version of the show, the show's cold opening had him giving the cast a pep talk, but ended with him apologizing to his former castmates on camera. Doumanian was fired and replaced with Dick Ebersol, who was able to produce just one show before that year's writers' strike forced an early end to the TV season. SNL's sixth season, mostly produced by Jean Doumanian, is remembered as the series' worst. While that season finale had no official host, it had begun with Chevy Chase reflecting on the old days with Mr. Bill. He also returned to read the news on Weekend Update. To great applause, at the end he introduced Franken, who had himself returned to the show for the first time since the previous season ended, for another commentary on the \\"Al Franken Decade.\\" Franken used the concept as a lead-in for a discussion of the show's turbulent preceding year, telling the audience how NBC had chosen Doumanian, instead of someone who knew how to produce the show like \\"me, Al Franken\\", without consulting Michaels or anyone else on the show's staff. The network, too, had realized after 12 episodes that \\"any English-speaking person\\" could have done better. But he did not have a much better opinion of Ebersol, who had been in charge of late-night programming for NBC when SNL had been launched in 1975, and thus became \\"one of the first people to steal credit for the success of Saturday Night Live.\\" He recited a list of failed comedies like The Waverly Wonders that Ebersol had been responsible for, and told the audience the show would improve, but not much. Instead, Franken suggested, it was time to end the show and its \\"tired old format\\" altogether. He called on the audience once again to send in postcards, this time urging NBC to \\"Put SNL to sleep.\\" However, after he concluded, Chase reminded him that he and Davis were supposed to host the next week, and he urged the audience to watch.

The exercise, which involved 1,200 personnel from four of the five branches of the U.S. military, was designed to train soldiers in skills needed to operate in overseas combat environments, including maneuvering through civilian populations. The announcements of these training exercises raised concerns and generated conspiracy theories that the exercise was a hostile military takeover.  Exercise details  The joint exercise in realistic military training (RMT) known as Jade Helm 15The military has not defined \\"Jade Helm 15\\" for the public as of January 2016. The acronym JADE stands for \\"Joint Assistant for Deployment and Execution,\\" \\"a knowledge-based mixed-initiative system that supports force deployment planning and management.

Its stated purpose was \\"to improve the Special Operations Forces' capability as part of the National Security Strategy\\". It was coordinated and led from Eglin Air Force Base, an Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) base in northwest Florida. Approximately 1,200 troops were engaged over the course of the exercise. They were \\"mainly Army Green Berets, but also a small group of Navy SEALS and Air Force special operations troops as well as conventional Army infantry\\", although the initial request to state officials from USSOCOM listed elements of the United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), Marine expeditionary units, the 82nd Airborne Division, and \\"interagency partners\\" as participants. Troops engaging in the exercise assumed the roles of either occupying or resistance forces. Most locations were in sparsely populated arid regions near small towns. Some participants wore civilian attire and drove civilian vehicles. Maps of the exercise included areas of the United States such as Colorado and California where no actual operations were planned. The cities in Texas include Bastrop, Smithville, Big Spring, Caddo Lake, Caldwell, Christoval, College Station, Dell City, Eldorado, Goliad, Junction, Leakey, Menard, Mountain Home, San Angelo, San Antonio, and Victoria. USSOCOM claimed that \\"the size and scope of Jade Helm sets this one apart\\" from previous training exercises, such as Derna Bridge or Robin Sage. In Bastrop, 60 soldiers took part, including the presence of two Humvee vehicles and a \\"water buffalo\\" water tank. Private land offered by residents would be used for the exercise, though he noted that they would not be paid for the land or receive a tax break of any kind. Lastoria also claimed that $150,000 in revenue would be brought to the area because of food, fuel, and shopping. Journalists were not allowed to embed in the operation, but the Texas State Guard and the civilian group Counter Jade Helm monitored the exercise.  Conspiracy theories  U.S. Army Special Operations Command map, depicting the US military plans during the Jade Helm 15 exercise The conspiracy theories seem to emanate from the map shown here from the U.S. Army Special Operations Command which divides the region into four colors, with two \\"hostile\\" states, two \\"permissive\\" states, two states leaning one way or the other, and California divided. Jim Shea of the Hartford Courants wrote that the conspiracy theories included: a \\"psychological operation aimed at getting people used to seeing military forces on the streets\\" so that they do not realize when an invasion actually takes place; an international operation aimed to seize people's guns; recently closed Walmarts used by the military to \\"stockpile supplies for Chinese troops who will be arriving to disarm Americans\\"; and a military plan to \\"round up political dissidents\\" and \\"remove key political figures\\" who may be against the imposition of martial law. Other theories have described Jade Helm 15 as a \\"secret plot\\" to impose martial law, confiscate firearms, invade Texas, and institute \\"total population control.\\" The conspiracy theories also included concern about the name of the exercise, with the \\"jade\\" possibly referring to China, or possibly an acronym for artificial intelligence developed by the U.S. military. Conspiracy theorist and Texas radio host Alex Jones said that \\"helm\\" is an acronym for \\"Homeland Eradication of Local Militants\\". There was some tie-in between the Jade Helm 15 exercise and a resurgence of the FEMA camps conspiracy theory with the exercise raising fear that it was a dry run for forcing citizens into internment camps. These fears were demonstrated to have been unfounded when the exercise was completed and no one was placed into a camp. Comet or asteroid impact Some conspiracy theorists have connected the Jade Helm 15 military exercise with an apocalypse caused by a comet or asteroid striking the Earth. The Jade Helm 15 military exercise had an ending date of September 15, 2015, which is the same month identified by some conspiracy theorists for the catastrophic impact of a comet or asteroid, based in part on a statement made May 13, 2014 by the French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius that the world has \\"500 days to avoid climate chaos\\". The conspiracy theorists claim that Jade Helm 15 is a dress rehearsal for the imposition of martial law which would be implemented in the event of a catastrophe of this level of severity. However, the NASA Near Earth Object Program publishes the Sentry Risk Table, which is a list that identifies such threats, and the list does not include any object with a high Torino Scale number (a measure of the severity of the threat) for 2015. Also, a NASA spokesperson said, \\"NASA knows of no asteroid or comet currently on a collision course with Earth\\". But some conspiracy theorists claim that the object has been tracked for years, the object name is known but its published coordinates and orbit information are incorrect, and the threat is not publicly listed because of the thought that panic would ensue. The apocalypse failed to happen on September 15, 2015.  Reactions  The Austin American-Statesman newspaper noted that after plans and maps of the exercise were made public, there was an \\"explosion of outrage on social media after the release of the map, which labeled Texas, Utah and the southern tip of California as 'hostile.'\\" There was also speculation that shuttered Walmart stores would be used for \\"guerrilla-warfare staging areas and FEMA processing camps\\", though this theory was debunked by the website Snopes.Mikkelson, Barbara (April 23, 2015). \\"Walmartyrs to the Cause\\". Snopes. A survey of registered Republicans by Public Policy Polling in May 2015, found that 32% thought that \\"the Government is trying to take over Texas\\", and that half of all Tea Party supporters are concerned with an imminent Texas invasion. Greg Capers, sheriff of San Jacinto County, published a letter in the Cleveland Advocate (of Cleveland, Texas), in response to numerous phone calls from citizens, in which he described \\"alternative news sources\\" that were spreading inaccurate information about the exercise, and encouraged citizens to \\"utilize legitimate mainstream news sources\\" for those interested in accurate information.  Politicians  On April 28, Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered the Texas State Guard to monitor the operation. \\"During the training operation, it is important that Texans know [that] their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed.\\" On May 2, 2015, Texas senator Ted Cruz told the South Carolina Republican Party's annual convention that he had \\"reached out to the Pentagon to inquire about this exercise.\\" > We are assured [that] it is a military training exercise.

U.S. Representative Louie Gohmert said in a statement on May 5, 2015 that his \\"office has been inundated with calls referring to the Jade Helm 15 military exercise\\" with concerns that the U.S. Army is preparing for \\"modern-day martial law\\". He alluded to a notorious remark made by Barack Obama, who claimed that Pennsylvanians were \\"bitter\\" and \\"cling to guns or religion\\":https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE0D61E3CF932A2575AC0A96E9C8B63 \\"I was rather appalled that the hostile areas amazingly have a Republican majority, 'cling to their guns and religion,' and believe in the sanctity of the United States Constitution\\". He asserted that \\"the map of the exercise needs to change, the names on the map need to change, and the tone of the exercise needs to be completely revamped so the federal government is not intentionally practicing war against its own states.\\" In a November 2015 GQ interview, President Obama described Jade Helm as \\"his favorite conspiracy theory\\".  Media  All News Pipelinehttp://allnewspipeline.com/Jade_Helm_2015.php broke Jade Helm to the world on March 13, 2015, five days before conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones, who began spreading the conspiracy theory on March 19, 2015, by saying on his radio program and on his website that the federal government was preparing to invade Texas. \\"They're going to practice breaking into things and stuff. This is going to be hellish,\\" Jones said. \\"Now this is just a cover for deploying the military on the streets ... This is an invasion ... in preparation for the financial collapse and maybe even Obama not leaving office.\\" In reaction to the sentiment that the military exercises might in fact be movement against American citizens, Dallas Morning News columnist Jacquielynn Floyd wrote a column titled, \\"Abbott should counter, not cater to, Texans' crazy Jade Helm fears,\\" noting that Abbott's \\"response to this nut- studded fruitcake of fear was unfortunate.\\" On April 29, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest addressed the concerns of critics in the regular press briefing, saying, \\"I have no idea what he's thinking,\\" regarding Abbott's letter to the Texas Guard. \\"In no way will the constitutional rights or civil liberties of any American citizen be infringed upon while this exercise is being conducted.\\" Comedian Jon Stewart addressed the debate around the exercises in a segment on The Daily Show on May 4 called \\"Fear and Absent Danger\\", noting that previous military exercises while Republican Rick Perry was governor did not raise similar concerns.  Polls  A survey by Public Policy Polling between May 7 and May 10, 2015, found that 32% of 685 Republican primary voters believed \\"the government is trying to take over Texas\\", 40% believed \\"the government is not trying to take over Texas\\" and 28% were \\"unsure\\".\\"Walker Leads Tightly Clustered GOP Field, Clinton Up Big Nationally\\", by Public Policy Polling  Russian disinformation  Clint Watts and two others in the FBI began to notice Russian disinformation campaigns starting in April 2014. Watts said that Russian-driven efforts to spread misinformation were involved with Jade Helm 15. In 2017, Facebook shut down a page called \\"Heart of Texas\\" which was found to be associated with a Russian company promoting disinformation, including promoting the Jade Helm conspiracy. On May 3, 2018, The Texas Tribune reported that Michael Hayden, a former director of the CIA and NSA said that the \\"hysteria\\" surrounding the training exercise \\"was fueled by Russians wanting to dominate 'the information space.'\\" Hayden said that Russian bots were used to spread misinformation.

It is found in the western Pacific Ocean. Description This species in particular is a fish from the coral reefs of Papua New Guinea. Pomacentrus aurifrons resembles Pomacentrus smithi with a similar color scheme and physiology, and are believed to be geminate species. According to Allen, P. aurifrons can be distinguished by its \\"pale grey to nearly white with blue spot on head scales, vertically elongate, blue streak on most body scales, broad zone of yellow encompassing snout, forehead, and base of anterior dorsal spines, translucent fins with bluish dorsal, anal, and caudal soft rays, and narrow yellow margin on spinous dorsal fin,\\". In Latin, auri means \\"gold\\" and frons means \\"forehead\\". Location Currently there are three places where P. aurifrons can be found. Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu are where current locations to locate the species. Behavior Pomacentrus aurifrons spend the majority of their time in coral reefs at a depth of about 2‚Äì14 m and live in groups. The coastal fringing reefs and offshore platform reefs they live on are generally composed of a variety of different sponge and both hard and soft coral. They feed on zooplankton.

The Living Archive of Aboriginal Languages (LAAL) is a digital archive of literature in endangered languages of Australia, containing works in over forty Australian Aboriginal languages from the Northern Territory, Australia. The project to build the archive was initially funded in 2012 by the Australian Research Council, and was developed in collaboration with the Charles Darwin University as the lead institution, the Northern Territory Government and the Australian National University. Later partners include the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education, the Northern Territory Library and the Northern Territory Catholic Education Office. Description LAAL is an online archive of literature in languages of the Northern Territory. Development Much of the literature in the archive was originally created as part of bilingual education programs in the Northern Territory from the early 1970s, but was in danger of being lost after Federal and Territory governments withdrew financial support for bilingual education. The project to build the archive was initially funded in 2012 by the Australian Research Council and involved the collaboration of the Charles Darwin University as the lead institution, the Northern Territory Government and the Australian National University. The first stage of building the archive was to recover as many of these books as possible (about 4000), to catalogue and digitise these materials, and, with permission from the original creators, make them publicly available online. Following the granting of a second round of funding by the Australian Research Council, the second stage of developing the archive began in 2014, focusing on further \\"search and rescue\\" of materials written by Indigenous authors in Northern Territory languages and also on engaging with community members, academics and schools on the use and enhancement of the collection. Later partners include the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education, the Northern Territory Library and the Northern Territory Catholic Education Office. The Archive continues to seek contributions of relevant materials from community members and researchers, provided the appropriate permissions are obtained. Access All the materials in the Living Archive are publicly available online, and can also be accessed using the LAAL Reader App. One the website, users can find and access the materials by clicking on areas of a map or by browsing a list of locations, languages, authors or books. The materials are made available under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Australia licence, and ownership of the stories and pictures remains with the Aboriginal language owners, creators of the work and their descendants. Use The materials in the archive can be used for a range of purposes. In addition to building the collection, the second stage of developing the archive focuses on engaging with communities, schools, and researchers. This stage aims to find ways of tailoring collections for local use, such as in literacy and language learning, as well as expanding and improving the collection with community involvement, for example through contributions of new or audio-recorded versions of stories. It also aims to find ways archived materials can be used for classroom activities, for example on traditional knowledge, and seeks to connect students and academics with language authorities for collaborative work.

The service was owned by national telecommunications provider Spark New Zealand but was purchased by satellite company Sky Television in December 2019. On 7 July 2020, Sky merged Lightbox into its own streaming service Neon using the existing streaming platform of Lightbox. Hema Patel was the general manager director of Lightbox. History In June 2014, Spark announced Lightbox (then called ShowmeTV), which allowed New Zealanders to stream TV shows, including Mad Men, Better Call Saul and Vikings. It was launched in August 2014. In January 2015, Lightbox partnered with Coliseum Sports Media to deliver a subscription-based sports streaming service called Lightbox Sport. Lightbox Sport included golf, English Premier League football and French Top 14 rugby. By March 2015, Lightbox faced competition from SVOD services Quickflix, Netflix and Neon. In October 2019, a Horizon Research survey of more than 1,000 New Zealanders found that 18% of those surveyed subscribed to Lightbox. By contrast, 59% subscribed to TVNZ OnDemand, 56% to Netflix, 29% to Sky, and 7% to Neon. In mid-December 2019, it was announced that Spark would be selling the Lightbox streaming service to the satellite television company Sky Television. Sky planned to merge Lightbox into its own online streaming service Neon on 7 July 2020. Spark also partnered with Sky to make the service available to Spark customers through the telecommunication company's entertainment offers during the first half of 2020. As part of the agreement, Sky met the operational costs of merging the two streaming services. In mid- June 2020, Sky announced that Lightbox would be merged into Neon on 7 July 2020. The merged service retained the Neon brand but continued using Lightbox's interface and features and includes content drawn from both Neon and the old Lightbox. Existing Spark customers can receive a NZ$9.95 discount. On 7 July, Sky formally merged Neon and Lightbox, with the former Lightbox app being revamped as Neon. The revamped Neon platform incorporates content and several features from Lightbox including the ability to download films and shows onto devices, rent movies, and create user profiles. Services and content Lightbox was available via their website on Windows 7, Windows 8 and OS X computers, and on a number of other devices including iOS, Android (version 4.2 and above), Apple TV using AirPlay, Android TV, Chromecast selected Samsung Smart TVs, and PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 consoles.

The Festival is held over 18 days in the dry season (May- Oct) and comprises a series of events including outdoor concerts, workshops, theatre, dance music, comedy, cabaret, film and visual arts. In 2020, Darwin Festival will be held from 6‚Äì23 August.  History   19th century  Darwin has a tradition of street parades and festival events dating back to early European settlement, following the issuing of Letters Patent annexing the Northern Territory to South Australia, 1863. The Township of Palmerston (as Darwin was then named) was surveyed by the South Australian Surveyor General GW Goyder in 1869 and by 1888 the non-Indigenous population of the Northern Territory consisted of around 1,200 Europeans and 6,000 Chinese.Table showing ‚ÄòPopulation of Northern Territory (Exclusive of Aboriginals) from 1881 to 1910 Inclusive‚Äô. In Commonwealth of Australia. Northern Territory. Report of the Government Resident for the year 1910. Mebourne : Govt. Printer,1911. Page 15. Chinese New Year processions organised by the Chinese storekeepers, market gardeners and coolies who settled in Palmerston after the gold rushes of the 1870s were hugely popular.  1900s‚Äì1940s  Palmerston was renamed Darwin following the Commonwealth takeover of the Northern Territory in 1911. By this time, largely through the restrictions of the White Australia Policy, Darwin's Asian population was in decline and amidst growing civil unrest, trade union organised marches gained in popularity. The Eight Hour Day Movement demonstration processions, popular in the early 1900s, were followed by Labour Day and May Day Marches held by the Darwin Workers' Club between 1919 and the late 1930s. Despite the restrictive immigration policy the Chinese community remained active in the social life of the town and formed the Darwin Chinese Recreation Club in December 1923 to take on all comers in the sports of boxing, Australian rules football, tennis, swimming and soccer. A small number of Italian migrants from Patagonia landed at Port Darwin in 1914 and found employment at Vestey's meat works. Following the attacks on Pearl Harbour in December 1941, the civilian population of Darwin was ordered to be evacuated and Darwin and the surrounding area was placed under military control following a bombing raid by the Japanese Air Force on 19 February 1942. The township was extensively damaged during a subsequent series of air raids on Australia by the Japanese Air Force between February 1942 and November 1943. During this time, Darwin was a garrison town under the control of the Department of the Army, who spared no effort to improve recreational and entertainment facilities for troops based in Darwin. At the end of the Second World War, Darwin reverted to civil control, with many of the evacuated administrative staff and the civilian population returning early in 1946. The departure of most of the armed services from the Northern Territory left little in the way of public entertainment facilities and following a public meeting the Darwin Workers' Club was re-established. A combined Stadium, Concert Hall and Meeting Place opened on 31 May 1946 with money subscribed and lent by its members and a series of concerts, fund raisers and boxing tournaments were staged at the Stadium after its completion in December 1946. The civilian population of the Northern Territory was increasing steadily and the 1947 census return recorded a population of 2,538 people inside the Darwin Town boundary.Commonwealth of Australia. \\"The Northern Territory Report for the Period 1st July 1949 to 30th June 1953\\" (Commonwealth Government Printer: Canberra, 1955), p. 29. May Day celebrations resumed in 1947, with a monster sports programme and a street procession led by Qantas staff. A large group of Aboriginal men who joined the march won the prize for the best parade Although much of China Town had been dismantled, a small number of Chinese people returned to Darwin after the war, re-establishing their businesses and building new homes in the outlying suburbs.  1950s‚Äì1980s  Chinese New Year celebrations resumed in 1950 and in 1953 the Darwin Chinese Recreation Club reformed and participated in a street procession as part of the Coronation Week Celebration in Darwin. An annual grant to assist Australian cultural organizations was instituted by the Commonwealth Government in 1952 and the sum of 1 000 pounds was distributed through five organisations in the Northern Territory, thereby enabling small festival type events.Commonwealth of Australia. \\"The Northern Territory Report for the Period 1st July 1949 to 30th June 1953\\" (Commonwealth Government Printer: Canberra, 1955), p. 33. By 1964 Commonwealth funding for cultural events was available to local organisations through a funding committee attached to the Northern Territory Administration Department of Welfare. Initial applications were made to the Regional Grants Committee in each local centre and passed on to the Administrator or to the Minister for final approval. In 1964/65 the first of these grants for the staging of exhibitions and events was received by the City of Darwin Festival Committee; the North Australian Eisteddfod Council; and the Centralian Arts Society.‚ÄòCultural organisations and institutions ‚Äì Establishment of an Australian Council for the Arts‚Äô.

The festivities were temporarily halted by the evacuation of Darwin following Cyclone Tracy, which devastated the city and its northern suburbs on Christmas Day 1974.

It is of major historical significance as the first major European settlement in Central Australia. Early Indigenous history Hut Eastern Arrernte Basedow The Karo:linga and Aldolanda people, now known as the East Aranda people are thought to have occupied the Arltunga and surrounding region for up to 20,000 years. An early map drawn by TGH Strehlow identifies at least thirty significant cultural sites in the region surrounding Arltunga, including water sources that would have supported early mining in the region. While much mythological ceremonial information remains sacred, it is widely known that the Kulaia serpent inhabits all places containing water. When Strehlow camped just south of Arltunga in 1935, he recorded other Eastern Aranda kangaroo, native cat and rain ceremonies and songs. While most the Easter Arnada people left the region in 1953 upon the establishment of the Santa Teresa Mission, they returned regularly for ceremonies well into the 1970s. Rock carvings and artifacts have been found in the Arltunga area, particularly near Paddy's Rock-Hole, Akura-ala Waterhole and the Joker's Mine Area and Gorge. Mining Gold was observed by South Australian explorer, David Lindsay in 1887 as he trekked from Port Darwin to the coast of South Australia. Subsequently, miners flocked to the area and Arltunga became the first substantial European settlement in Central Australia. The town was kept alive for a while after the initial gold rush when the South Australian Government built the Government Battery and Cyanide Works in 1898. Construction was supervised by James Gilbert Woolcock, who had to overcome significant logistical problems. With the Battery's closure in 1916, the population declined to 25 by 1933. Mission A mission for Aboriginal people called the Sacred Heart Mission was established at Arltunga in 1935 by Father P. Moloney. It was moved to a more 'suitable' site at Phillipson's Block (Santa Teresa) southeast of Alice Springs in 1952. Recent history Arltunga Historical Reserve was established in 1975 and comprises 5,000 ha. Owing to the harshness of the climate and the fact that local stone was used in the construction of buildings, the town is well preserved. The reserve was nominated for heritage listing in 2008. While the Government Battery and Cyanide Works site at Arltunga was successfully listed in 1995, the nomination for the rest of the reserve was unresolved due to a native title claim in the area until 2014, when a second nomination was successful.

The brand was founded in 2009 in New York City, United States and manufactured apparel and fashion accessories. The brand has been closed down in 2011 due to the differences in vision between shareholders in mainland China and United States. History As CEO and founder of New York-based fashion company Truth and Pride, Ken Erman continued to evolve and expand global reach through his collaboration with Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai. Erman grew up around fashion. His family owns a large apparel company based out of Pennsylvania called Notations, and he spent several years cultivating an in-depth knowledge of the apparel business. In 2003, he collaborated with American singer Gwen Stefani and created the fashion brand L.A.M.B. In 2008, Erman and Brenda Lin, the president of Truth and Pride, met with Jolin Tsai in Taiwan and they shared the same creative vision. In February 2009, Tsai and Erman announced the release of a new fashion brand named after Tsai's 2003 album, Magic (also known as See My 72 Changes literally in Chinese), at SoHo Showroom in Manhattan, New York City. The brand was debuted in July 2009 at Nordstrom of 12 cities in the United States, including New York City, San Francisco, and Scottsdale. In July 2009, Tsai made a guest appearance in connection with the Fall 2009 collection of her fashion brand at Nordstrom at the Westfield San Francisco Centre. In August 2009, the brand was introduced by Taiwanese department store Level 6ix into Taiwan, and the brand planned to introduced the brand into other areas, including China, Singapore, and Malaysia. In February 2010, Tsai made a second public appearance in collection with the Fall 2010 collection of the brand at SoHo Showroom in Manhattan. In the same month, the brand opened its first boutique at Times Square in Shanghai, China, and it was sold in over 30 stores in North America and Asia. Seventy Two Changes sales have expanded from $100 million in 2009 to a predicted $400 million in 2010. In the following year, Tsai's contract with Truth and Pride ended, but Tsai had no intention to renew the agreement. Due to the differences in vision between shareholders of mainland China and United States, Tsai chose to quit the business and would like to start an online fashion store.

Distribution and habitat This species occurs along the coast and estuaries from Lambert's Bay in the Western Cape, around the Cape and northwards along the Indian Ocean coastline to Delagoa Bay in Mozambique. It is well-adapted to life both in the littoral zone of sheltered marine bays and of freshwater estuaries. Taxonomy The Common Sandprawn was first described in the literature by the Rev. Thomas R. R. Stebbing, an ardent Darwinist who had been banned from preaching; the type specimen was collected at \\"Gordon's Bay, a little below high water mark\\", and placed in the genus Callianassa established by William Elford Leach in 1814. The species was subsequently moved to the genus Callichirus.Poore, G. (2015). \\"Callichirus kraussi\\" (Stebbing, 1900). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=477662 on 2015-05-06. Description The original description reads: Ecology Callichirus kraussi plays an important role in the ecology of littoral zones by its bioturbation which can alter sediment properties and thereby affect biofilms, microalgal and microbial levels, and meiobenthic and macrobenthic communities. Nutrients and bioturbation can also interact to shape macrofaunal communities. The distribution of these prawns is dictated by sediment properties which in turn are dependent on shore height and distance from the lagoon mouth. Collecting of the species as bait may reduce numbers significantly in some localities and disturb sedimentary environments.\\"Treatise on Zoology - Anatomy, Taxonomy, Biology\\". The Crustacea. Volume 9. Frederick Schram, Carel von Vaupel Klein (editors). A 2010 project in the Kasouga Estuary, on the south-eastern coast of South Africa, found that this species contributed significantly to bioturbation, leading to a decline in microphytobenthic algae which in turn caused a significant decrease in numbers of the gastropod Nassarius kraussianus. Another study in the Swartvlei estuary found that dense growth of the seagrass Zostera capensis and large numbers of burrowing bivalves led to a marked decrease in sandprawn numbers. Cryptic species DNA sequence data indicate that Callichirus kraussi comprises up to four distinct evolutionary lineages that may represent morphologically indistinguishable sister species. Their ranges are linked to southern African marine biogeographical provinces, with the tropical lineage on the north-east coast being the most distinct. Relationship with humans The species is used as bait for commercial and recreational fishing, and is often harvested by suction with a yabby pump.http://www.alveytv.com/video.php?video=0037 References External links * Commercial crustaceans Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Freshwater crustaceans Crustaceans of South Africa Thalassinidea Crustaceans described in 1900 ","title":"Callichirus kraussi"},{"id":"46577550","text":"Andraca paradisea is a moth of the family Endromidae.

At the outbreak of World War II, known as \\"The Emergency\\",Share (preface p.ix) Ireland declared neutrality and became isolated as never before.Ferriter, What If?, p. 100: (Quoting Garvin) \\"Irish isolationism was a very powerful cultural sentiment at that time\\". Although Ireland had a substantial food surplus, there were shortages of specific foods such as fruits, wheat and tea. There were very few Irish ships as shipping had been neglectedSweeney p. 204 since independence. Foreign ships which had transported Irish cargoes, before the war, were soon unavailable. Otto, an Estonian ship, was in Cobh when the Republic of Estonia was annexed by the USSR. In October 1941 trustees for the absent owners leased her to Irish Shipping. She was renamed Irish Willow,Cleare p. 62 She made 18 voyages to Saint John, New Brunswick, returning with wheat. She also exported food to Britain and imported coal. Initially Irish ships sailed in British convoys. In the light of experience they chose to sail alone, relying on their neutral markings. German respect for that neutrality varied from friendly to tragic. Construction The ship was built for the United States Shipping Board in Toledo, Ohio (Yard Number:143) by the Toledo Shipbuilding Company. A Standard World War I cargo ship, she was laid down as War Flag, but named Lake Sunapee after the lake in New Hampshire. She was launched on 28 December 1917, while World War I was still in progress. The ship was a single deck vessel with a grain capacity of and bunker capacity of . She was long, wide and deep. Early history As a Laker she was designed to navigate the canal locks bypassing Niagara Falls. Lake Sunapee served as a U.S. Army transport, based in Cardiff, Glamorgan, United Kingdom, bringing coal to France. She departed from Cardiff for New York City on 7 June 1919, arrived 25 June and was decommissioned at Hoboken, New Jersey 3 July 1919. Little is known of her service in the years immediately following World War I, although it is recorded that she arrived at New York from the Par√° on 29 May 1920. She was laid up until 1923 when she was sold to W. J. Gray Jnr. of San Francisco and renamed Frank Lynch. Frank Lynch was built as a coal-fired steamship with a triple-expansion steam engine. In 1923 the engine was replaced with a Werkspoor diesel engine.Spong p. 29 On 29 August 1929, the passenger ship collided with the tanker S.C.T. Dodd and sank with the loss of many lives. Frank Lynch, Munami and S.C.T. Dodd rescued the survivors. In 1937, she was sold to the Greek company George D. Gratsos' Sons, who renamed her Nestor.Spong p.29 In 1938 she suffered a total engine failure and was towed to Rotterdam,Cleare p. 62 where she was converted back to a steamer. In 1939 she was sold to K Jurnas of Estonia and renamed Otto. World War II Background The Irish government had pursued a policy of autarky or self- sufficiency, so international trade was discouraged and the mercantile marine ignored. At independence in 1923 there were 127 Irish ships, but by September 1939 there were only 56, including 7 which did not carry cargo.Forde p. 1 Irish imports such as wheat, maize, timber and fertilizer were carried on foreign, mainly British, ships. With the outbreak of hostilities, they were unavailable. Churchill explained \\"we need this tonnage for our own supply\\".Sweeney, p. 216 In November 1939, American ships were excluded from Irish waters by the neutrality act.Burne, p. 537 By the end of 1940, nine Irish ships as well as ten neutral foreign ships carrying Irish cargoes, some of which had been chartered by Irish companies, had been sunk by U-boats, the Luftwaffe or mines.Sweeney p. 217 Against this background, the government founded Irish Shipping and sought ships which it could charter or purchase. Irish Willow was one of those ships. Soviet claim In June 1940 the Soviet Union occupied the Baltic states and on 6 August 1940 Estonia was annexed as the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. Industry was nationalised and Estonian ships were instructed to go a Soviet port. There were several ships from the Baltic states in, or heading to, Irish ports. All ignored that instruction. Peter Kolts, a crewman of Pirer, another Estonian ship at Dublin south quays, hoisted the hammer and sickle and prevented Captain Joseph Juriska from removing it. The Garda S√≠och√°na were called. Following a court appearance before Justice Michael Lennon the sailor spent a week in jail.Forde p. 42 The twenty Estonian ships in British ports also received this telegram. August Torma, the last Estonian envoy in London, presented their case to the Foreign Office and said that they needed reassurances if they were to stay in Britain. He failed to obtain reassurance. The majority went to the Soviet Union. Following the verdict of Justice Michael Lennon, the ships in Irish ports choose to remain. Ivan Maisky, the Soviet Union's ambassador to the United Kingdom, applied to the High Court in Dublin for possession of the ships. Their owners could not be contacted. The Soviet case was supported by a letter from John Whelan Dulanty, the Irish High Commissioner in London. This letter, written when the ships had been instructed to go immediately to the USSR, asked if the three ships carrying cargoes destined for Ireland, could first deliver their Irish cargo. Maisky had agreed on behalf of the Soviet Union, provided that the Irish government guaranteed that after discharging their cargo they would be given food sufficient for the journey to a Soviet port. A. K. Overend K.C., acting for Maisky, said that this established that his client was recognised by Ireland as \\"the proper person to give instruction to the ships\\",Sweeney p. 225 and that his client was the only claimant. John McEvoy was the honorary consul of the Republic of Estonia in Dublin. He opposed the Soviet claim along with Estonian representatives in Switzerland. Though he lacked diplomatic status, the Court recognised the right of Herbert Martinson, described as \\"an Estonian national, resident in Switzerland\\", to vindicate the rights of the absent owners; John McEvoy and Herbert Martinson were recognised as trustees for the owners. The High Court considered five ships: three from Estonia, Otto, Piret and Mall, and two from Latvia, RƒÅmava and Everoja. McEvoy acted for the various owners of the Estonian ships. On 16 May 1941 the High Court rejected the Soviet claim. The Soviet authorities appealed against the decision to the five-judge Supreme Court. On 3 July 1941 the appeal was unanimously dismissed with costs. The Soviet Union made a 'most emphatic' protest.The Irish Times 9 August 1941 Martinson leased the three Estonian vessels to Irish Shipping for the duration of the war plus three months. The two Latvian ships transferred to the British registry and sailed under the Red Ensign. RƒÅmava moved to Britain. Everoja remained in Ireland.Sweeney p. 226 Everoja was torpedoed and sunk on 3 November 1941 by while in convoy SC-52 on passage from Canada to Dublin with 6,400 tons of wheat.Walter Kennedy p. 45 John McEvoy was acting at his own expense, but the court directed that he was to be reimbursed from the income earned by Otto (Irish Willow). McEvoy's role was acknowledged by Estonia following its independence (the Singing Revolution), when the President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves said: \\"... ... we are thankful that Ireland never recognised the illegal annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union after the Second World War. We will never forget John McEvoy, Estonia's honorary consul in Dublin from 1938 to 1960. Among other things, one of his good deeds was helping to protect the interests of the Estonian shipowners ...\\" Irish Willow In October 1941, in Cobh, Otto was chartered by Irish Shipping. She was brought to Dublin for extensive repairs. On 5 December 1941, she made her first voyage as Irish Willow: She went from Cobh to Dublin under Captain G.R. Bryan, from Rathfarnam, previously captain of City of Dublin. H. Cullen, previously of Irish Elm, was first officer. H. Jurgenson was chief engineer; he was an Estonian national, and had been the chief engineer when she was Otto.Cleare, p. 62 As engine components could not be located, the repairs had to be completed in Canada. On 5 December she went on her first commercial voyage, under Captain R Shanks of Belfast, as Irish Willow. She went to Troon for fuel and then joined convoy ON-47. The convoy departed on 15 December 1941. Around this time, Irish crews were refusing to travel in convoy. Irish Willow \\"lost\\" her convoy. She arrived in Saint John on 12 January 1942 and on 22 January loaded her cargo of wheat. Repairs delayed her a further two weeks. She was scheduled to return in convoy SC-68. Returning alone, a submarine was spotted on 3 February.Cleare p. 63 There was no contact. She unloaded her cargo of wheat in Waterford on 2 March and then went again for a further wheat cargo from St John for Waterford. During the war, she completed 18 such voyages. Encounter with U-753 Kenneth King from the deck of , signalling to Irish Willow \\"send master and ships papers\\" National Maritime Museum of Ireland On the morning of 16 March 1942, sighted a lone ship, south-west of the Rockall Bank (Irish Willow), and prepared to sink her until they saw her neutral markings (the Irish tricolour and the word EIRE) At 2 pm U-753 surfaced and signalled \\"send master and ship's papers\\". As Captain Shanks was born in Belfast and could be regarded as British, this was considered unwise. Chief Officer Henry Cullen, with four crew as oarsmen went instead. In the conning tower he explained that his captain was too elderly for the small boat. He spoke about Ireland's neutrality. He reminded them that the next day would be Saint Patrick's Day. He sensed that he was making progress when tumblers of schnapps were produced in honour of Saint Patrick.Forde p. 43,44 But then the Germans ‚Äì who seemed apologetic ‚Äì said that they were awaiting instructions whether or not to sink the ship; they would, however, fire a red flare five minutes beforehand if they were to sink Irish Willow. Cullen and the oarsmen returned to their ship. They were given a bottle of cognac, to take back \\"for the crew\\". There was an anxious wait until eventually the U-boat fired a green flare. Rescuing the crew of Empire Breeze  Convoy ON 122 left Liverpool on 15 August 1942. Ten days later, on 25 August 1942, when they were in the mid-Atlantic, the convoy was attacked by Wolfpack Lohs.McShane p. 256 Four ships were torpedoed and sunk. The convoy retreated into a fogbank, with visibility less than , probably saving further loss. The fog continued to thicken. had hit the 7,457 ton with two torpedoes.McShane p. 255 An SOS was transmitted and acknowledged. The 47 surviving crew abandoned ship and took to their three lifeboats. A fourth lifeboat was destroyed during launch. One crewman died Empire Breeze remained afloat. The rescue ship Stockport was detailed to rescue them. Irish Willow was to the west, too far away to help. 24 hours after the attack the crew of Empire Breeze were still in their lifeboats. Stockport had failed to locate them in the fog, so she left to rejoin the convoy. There were three radio officers. They had a portable radio transmitter in a lifeboat. Repeated SOS messages were not acknowledged. Empire Breeze was still afloat. Captain Thomson and some of the crew re-boarded. The cook prepared hot meals. Joseph Brown, a radio officer, connected their portable radio with the ship's aerial and rebroadcast the SOS. This was heard and acknowledged by Belle Isle radio station in Canada.McShane p. 258 The rescue tug and the corvette were sent to rescue and, if possible, to salvage Empire Breeze. They failed to locate her or the survivors.McShane p. 229 A serious problem was that there had been fog for the previous few days, astronomical observations had not been taken, so no ship in the area knew their exact location. The various accounts of this event give different locations: www.wrecksite.eu (from the convoy report) has . Frank Forde's book (from the log of Irish Willow) quotes .Forde p. 46 36 hours after the attack they sent another SOS. Irish Willow heard this SOS, she responded and headed towards the scene.McShane p. 260 Irish Willow replied, asking how long they could hold out. Captain Thomson of Empire Breeze estimated six hours. Captain Shanks of Irish Willow replied \\"Coming to you ‚Äì with you in about five hours\\". The fog became denser and visibility reduced to zero. Rather than plotting locations, (dead reckoning) Irish Willow was using direction finding equipment; she was travelling towards the SOS signal: It was dangerous for Irish Willow. They knew the direction to take, but did not know the distance. Travelling in fog, they could collide with Empire Breeze, or endanger survivors in the water. Extra look-outs were posted along her bow and whistles were sounded every two minutes. The repeating SOS messages could attract U-boats, seeking to \\"finish the job\\",Forde p. 47 and if such a U-boat found Irish Willow at the scene, its attitude could be quite different to that encountered on 16 March.

As they rounded Hook Lighthouse they were met by the RNLI lifeboat Annie-Blanche-Smith from Dunmore East with an advance party of doctors and Red Cross volunteers. The Dunmore East Parish Hall had been converted into a reception center. A full team of Red Cross volunteers had arrived from Waterford. Hot meals and medical facilities were awaiting the survivors. It was decided to land the survivors at Dunmore East, while Irish Willow continued to Waterford. Two were taken by ambulance to Waterford Infirmary with fever.McShane p. 263 On 4 September 1942, the Munster Express published an interview with Captain Thomson \\"We are very pleased to land in Eire, and we certainly could not have found a better landing\\". Post war service In May 1946 Irish Willow was returned to Egon Jurgenson. She was sold to Cia. de Vapores Veraguas and renamed Veraguas with a Panamanian registry. She continued to trade for a further 14 years. At the end of her 42-year career she was scrapped at Tamise, Belgium in July 1960.Cleare p. 65 Legacy Irish Willow rescued the 47 survivors from Empire Breeze. Throughout the war, Irish ships answered SOS calls and stopped to rescue, irrespective of nationality, and frequently ‚Äì as in this instance ‚Äì at risk to themselves. Ships in convoy were, usually, forbidden from stopping to rescue, lest they then became a target. The Empire Breeze crew were in their lifeboats when Athelprince, with the convoy commodore aboard, had to alter course to avoid collision with the abandoned Empire Breeze,McShane p. 256. but did not stop to rescue the crew. Irish ships rescued, at least, 534 seafarers during the war. Before the war, Irish Shipping Ltd did not exist. Its 15 ships were not under the Irish Flag. During the war, they imported more than a million tons of essential supplies: 712,000 tons of wheat; 178,000 tons of coal; 63,000 tons of phosphate (fertilizer); 24,000 tons of tobacco; 19,000 tons of newsprint; 10,000 tons of lumber; and over 100,000 tons of more than 500 types of other goods. (This is in addition to the imports carried by other Irish ships) On 16 May 1945, a week after VE Day √âamon de Valera addressed the nation: In June 1946 a contract was signed with John Redhead and Sons, shipbuilders of South Shields to construct a new Irish Willow.Cleare p. 101 See also * Irish neutrality during World War II ‚Äì international relations in World War II * Irish Mercantile Marine during World War II * Battle of the Atlantic Other ships operated by Irish Shipping during World War II Other Irish ships operating during World War II * Innisfallen  Notes References  Bibliography Books   Journal * Newsletter Magazine of Irish Shipping Ltd * 1918 ships Ships built in Ohio Standard World War I ships World War I merchant ships of the United States Transport ships of the United States Army Steamships of the United States Merchant ships of the United States Steamships of Greece Merchant ships of Greece Steamships of Estonia Merchant ships of Estonia World War II merchant ships of Estonia Steamships of the Republic of Ireland World War II merchant ships of the Republic of Ireland Maritime incidents in March 1942 Independent Ireland in World War II Maritime history of Ireland Steamships of Panama Merchant ships of Panama Ireland‚ÄìSoviet Union relations ","title":"SS Irish Willow (1918)"},{"id":"46577671","text":"The Bertoldsbrunnen (\\"Bertold's Fountain\\") is a monument in the historic city of Freiburg im Breisgau. It is situated at the crossing of the Salz- and Bertoldsstra√üe with the Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe. The fountain is one of the central locations of the city. A tram station with the same name is situated at the Bertoldsbrunnen where all five tramways of the Freiburger Verkehrs AG stop.  History  The Fischbrunnen (\\"Fish Fountain\\") was situated at the crossing of the Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe and the Salzstra√üe until 1806. It was then moved north to the M√ºnsterstra√üe because a new fountain was to be constructed. As it was destroyed during World War II, a copy of the Fischbrunnen was built on the northern side of the Minster Square. The new fountain at the crossing of the Salzstra√üe and Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe was built in 1807 in remembrance of May 5, 1806, when Freiburg swore its oath to the new territorial lord, the prince-elector Karl Friedrich von Baden, who was promoted to grand duke in June 1806. However, the monument of the dukes of Z√§hringen was not only for Friedrich, who had the titles of grand duke of Baden and duke of Z√§hringen. It was also a symbol of the worship of duke Berthold III ‚Äî the founder of Freiburg, Conrad I ‚Äî who built the M√ºnster, and Albert of Austria ‚Äî the donor of the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg. All this was expressed through Latin inscriptions at the pedestal of the fountain, which read:Denkmal der Herzoge von Z√§ringen von der √§ltesten Z√§ringer-Stadt Freyburg, Ihrem Landesf√ºrsten geweiht. Freyburg im Br., 1807, S. 6 f * North Face: * East Face: * South Face: * West Face: The monument was designed in accordance with the plans of the Freiburg municipal council Ferdinand Wei√ü, which were examined and modified by the Baden construction director, Friedrich Weinbrenner. The fountain was built by the mason and stone carver Johann Georg Riescher (1759‚Äì1827), while the sculptor Franz Xaver Hauser executed the model, the inscriptions and the statue. The latter showed Bethold III. of Z√§hringen, depicted as an armoured knight with a shield and a spear. The statue was east-facing, facing the neighbouring ancestral Z√§hringen castle. It was mounted on a pedestal , for which Rischer had to use contractually, the large 10¬Ω foot unit long, and, 5¬Ω foot width and, 1 foot tick altar stone from the broken Dominican church. The other stones originated in the stone mine of Mussbach, which today belongs to Freiamt. The costs added up to 3806 guilder. Riescher, who was working on the trough and the pillar, was supported by Hauser, who as a consequence was blamed for the delay of the completion of the statue.Michael Klant: Vergessene Bildhauer. In: Skulptur in Freiburg. Kunst des 19. Jahrhunderts im √∂ffentlichen Raum, Freiburg 2000, S. 164‚Äì172, S. 164 f. Vinzenz Hauser, a brother of Franz Xaver, was responsible for the gilding of the monument. Vinzenz Hauser (1759-1831), a brother of Franz Xaver, was responsible for gilding the monument. In 1888 the former octagonal basin of the fountain was removed to ease the traffic flow. The sculptor Julius Seitz replaced the octagonal basin by attaching a basin to each side of the substructure, whose girders symbolise the four elements in stylized animal figures. Moreover, in 1904 the fountain was shifted 2,50 metre northwards in order to cope with the shift of rails for the electrical tram. The statement by the Freiburger Newspaper, that the Bertholdsbrunnen is still named Fischbrunnen by the vernacular is erroneous, since the Fischbrunnen was shifted as neighbour fountain northbound and continuously retained its name. The fountain of Z√§hringen was completely destroyed by bombers during a British airstrike on November 27, 1944. The offer of the sculptor Hugo Knittel to make a replica of the old figure for free was turned down by Joseph Schlippe who was responsible for the reconstruction for he wanted to construct a ‚Äútimeless‚Äù fountain. Knittel‚Äôs draft was based partly on prewar pictures made by the spouse of the company Annemarie Brenzinger. In the end, the curatorship of Bertoldsbrunnen, which was founded in 1957, agreed on the design by Nikolaus R√∂slmeir (1901 ‚Äì 1977).Peter Kalchthaler Nikolaus R√∂slmeir in: Freiburger Biographien, Promo-Verlag Moritz GmbH, Freiburg 2002. It provided for a relatively abstract monument: a pedestal made out of limestone, approximately 12 feet tall, which is positioned in a shallow water basin (fountain) and which carries an equestrian statue. The overall shape of the fountain with its sculpture is inspired by gothic pointed arches, which is supposed to establish a connection to the Freiburg Minster.Karl Schmid; Hans Schadek;: Die Z√§hringer. 2, Anstoss und Wirkung Thorbecke, Sigmaringen 1986, , S. 372 The pedestal bears the inscription \\"For the Dukes of Z√§hringen, founders and men of Freiburg im Breisgau\\" (Den Herz√∂gen von Z√§hringen, Gr√ºndern und Herren von Freiburg im Breisgau). The crests of the (Swiss) Z√§hringer cities were not incorporated in the pedestal as this would have weakened the overall impression. An emblem from the Middle Ages served as basis for the equestrian statue. The fountain was financed with donations which had been collected after the city council had conditioned it in February 1958. Overall, it cost 120,000 Deutsche Mark. On November 15, 1965, Lord Major Eugen Keidel laid the foundation stone. On November 27, 1965, the anniversary of the bomb attack of 1944, the fountain was presented to the public. However, due to the abstract design of the knight cast in bronze, the people were not pleased with it.Schadek, S. 27 In the year 1972,Gerhard Gre√ü: Verkehrsknoten Freiburg und seine Umgebung in den f√ºnfziger und sechziger Jahren. EK-Verlag, Freiburg 1997, , S. 49 the Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe was pedestrianized. Because of this, the fountain was moved from the tram station north of the crossroads to its present locating in its middle. At the same time, the fountain basin was taken off, and the monument was placed in a water basin embedded in the ground. In 1979,Uwe Mauch: Freiburg: Gleissanierung: Bertoldsbrunnen muss den Baggern weichen, Badische Zeitung, 3. September 2013, abgerufen am 3. September 2013 the fountain had to be moved from the tram junction point north of the intersection to its present-day location right in the middle of the intersection. Due to road works carried out by Freiburg Verkehrs AG and Badenova, a municipal energy provider, to modernize the rails and the sewers in this area, the fountain was not accessible from June to October 2014.Joachim R√∂derer: Freiburg: Kommunalwahl: Wird die Bertoldsbrunnen- Sanierung aus politischen Gr√ºnden verschoben?, Badische Zeitung, 29. November 2013, abgerufen am 13. Dezember 2013 In addition, the lighting of the memorial was modernized: Bertold is now illuminated by four LED lights incorporated in the water basin of the fountain.

It opened on September 21, 1960, at 33 West 55th Street in Manhattan. The restaurant was established by Fred Decr√© and Robert Meyzen, with Roger Fessaguet as head chef, and took its name from the type of sailing ships Christopher Columbus sailed on his voyages to the New World. Like most European restaurants, La Caravelle had a menu that changed daily. This made the restaurant popular with new customers and also brought them back regularly. Salvador Dal√≠, John Lindsay, Leland Hayward, Walter Cronkite and Dorothy Kilgallen often dined at the restaurant in its early years. President John F. Kennedy was especially fond of La Caravelles vichyssoise and chicken in champagne sauce, and he often requested them as \\"take out\\" orders to eat on the plane while traveling. Twenty years after its opening, chef Roger Fessaguet left the kitchen to become an owner with Meyzen due to the retirement of Fred Decr√©. In 1984, Robert Meyzen retired and Fessaguet and Andr√© Jammet took over ownership of the restaurant. The following year, a New York Magazine article cited it as one of the best restaurants in New York City, and mentioned that most guidebooks gave it their highest rating. Fessaguet retired in 1988, leaving ownership with Jammet and his wife. The Jammets redecorated La Caravelle in 1990, replacing the original red carpets and banquettes with a color scheme of green and peach. Artist Nina Duran was hired to create a small mural for the restaurant's foyer. The restaurant closed on May 22, 2004, despite garnering the James Beard Foundation's Most Outstanding Restaurant in the Country award in the same year. The name is now known for champagnes produced by the Jammets; the restaurant began serving them as its house brand in 1997. History The restaurant was originally owned by Fred Decr√© and Robert Meyzen, with Roger Fessaguet as head chef. Decr√© and Meyzen, ma√Ætres d‚Äôh√¥tel at Le Pavillon, left there to open the restaurant in midtown Manhattan's Shoreham Hotel, hiring Fessaquet, who also worked at Le Pavillon, as its first executive chef. The restaurant's name was taken from the type of sailing ships Christopher Columbus sailed on his voyages to the New World and represented their hopes for a new beginning in the restaurant business with its opening. Artist Jean Pag√®s was hired to create a series of murals depicting typical Parisian scenes for the space that was a speakeasy during the Prohibition era. Pag√®s added to the restaurant's murals in the 1960s; his work was accidentally altered by fellow artist Salvador Dal√≠ when Dali scratched one of the murals with his cane while dining there with friends. Like most European restaurants, La Caravelle had a menu that changed daily. This made the restaurant popular with new customers and also brought them back regularly. Salvador Dal√≠, John Lindsay, Leland Hayward and Dorothy Kilgallen often dined at the restaurant in its early years. The journalist and broadcaster Walter Cronkite was a regular visitor to La Caravelle and enjoyed eating pike quenelles in lobster cream sauce. Other frequent visitors included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Marlene Dietrich. Joseph P. Kennedy had been a patron of Le Pavillon, but after Decr√© and Meyzen opened their new restaurant, Kennedy switched his patronage to La Caravelle, dining there regularly when in New York. It became a popular place for the Kennedy family to visit. Fessaguet chose and trained Ren√© Verdon to be chef at the White House when John F. Kennedy was elected president the year after opening. Verdon spent some weeks working with Fessaquet on the Kennedy family's favorite dishes. President Kennedy was especially fond of La Caravelles vichyssoise and chicken in champagne sauce. He often requested them as \\"take out\\" orders and would have them heated up on the plane as he traveled. Decr√© and Meyzen renamed the dish on their menu; Poularde Maison Blanch then became \\"White House Chicken\\". In 1964, the Kennedys held a family reunion at La Caravelle; one of the subjects of discussion at the reunion was said to be whether Robert F. Kennedy should ask to be nominated as vice president at the upcoming 1964 Democratic National Convention. Joseph P. Kennedy was in attendance and walked into the restaurant with the aid of a cane. Lunch preparation at La Caravelle By 7:30 a.m., head chef Fessaguet had decided on the day's lunch menu, estimated the number of diners La Caravelle would have and ordered the provisions for it. An hour later, the fresh vegetables were being peeled and sliced and the various sauces were on the stoves. The restaurant's pastry chef began his work on the various pastries and desserts for the day's lunch; the lunch preparations were completed and the kitchen staff could sit down for lunch. By noon, the waiters had donned their uniforms and the prepared food was on silver trays on a kitchen table. At 12:45, the orders for the day's luncheon guests began coming into the kitchen; by 2 p.m., 92 patrons had been served. In 1967, La Caravelles preparations for lunch were the subject of a short film, French Lunch, which shows the preparation in the kitchen of an entire meal seating. Management and cuisine changes Twenty years after its opening, chef Roger Fessaguet left the kitchen to become an owner with Meyzen due to the retirement of Fred Decr√©. In 1984, Robert Meyzen retired and Fessaguet and Andr√© Jammet took over ownership of the restaurant. The following year, a New York Magazine article cited it as one of the best restaurants in New York City, and mentioned that most guidebooks gave it their highest rating. Fessaguet retired in 1988, leaving ownership with Jammet and his wife. The Jammets redecorated La Caravelle in 1990, replacing the original red carpets and banquettes with a color scheme of green and peach. Artist Nina Duran was hired to create a smaller mural for the restaurant's foyer. Beginning in 2001, the Jammets started replacing many of the dishes La Caravelle was noted for with updated cuisine they described as more pleasing to the \\"contemporary palate\\". Some of the old favorite selections were relegated to a menu section labeled \\"Les Classiques\\", which became the minority of the offerings. The couple decided not to renew the restaurant's lease and it was closed in 2004. Last night of business The customers who arrived on La Caravelle‚Äçs last night of business were a mixture of regulars who had come for one last meal and bid farwell, as well as those who had never visited it before and wanted to see a piece of New York history before it was no more. Mr. and Mrs. Walter Cronkite dined with colleague Andy Rooney and his daughter; the Cronkites said they had been patrons of La Caravelle for 43 years. A couple came with their teenage daughter, who was so fussy about food, the La Caravelle chef would cook a packaged macaroni and cheese dinner for her. Another family of three made reservations for four; one for the husband's mother who had been a La Caravelle regular and had died in 2000. People with no reservations managed to gain entrance to the restaurant's bar and were able to be seated at a table. A young couple who had come to have a drink on La Caravelles last night was graciously seated at the table which was formerly reserved for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who continued to patronize the restaurant after her marriage to Aristotle Onassis. Upon entering the restaurant's main room, a woman exclaimed that it was her best New York moment and she could now move to the suburbs. Though the restaurant never offered music or entertainment, the Jammets had arranged for Robert White, a tenor and teacher at the Juilliard School to perform \\"Danny Boy\\". White was a patron of La Caravelle on the restaurant's first night of business in 1960. It was awarded the James Beard Foundation's Most Outstanding Restaurant in the Country award in the year of its closing. The name is now known for champagnes produced by the Jammets; the restaurant began serving them as its house brand in 1997.

The Parish Council does not yet have its own website; however, the Rushton Manor Courts Leet and Baron does record the Proceedings of the Parish Council, which include minutes and agendas. At one time there were two adjacent civil parishes, Rushton Spencer and Rushton James. Rushton Spencer has the River Dane at its northern boundary with Cheshire, and the road crosses the river at Hugbridge; Bosley Cloud is the western boundary. To the south, separated by a stream, is Rushton James, which is bordered by Long Edge in the west, and Ryecroft Gate in the east. The parishes were amalgamated in 1934 to form Rushton civil parish.A P Baggs, M F Cleverdon, D A Johnston and N J Tringham, 'Leek: Rushton Spencer', in A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 7, Leek and the Moorlands, ed.

The Knot Inn is on Station Lane, west of the main road; it is near the former railway station and used to be called the Railway Inn. The Royal Oak is on the main road at the junction with Leek Old Road. A short distance south-east of the village, on Leek Old Road, is St Helen's Well. There is an old belief that when the well becomes dry, there will be bad times. History Medieval The name Rushton, from Old English, means a settlement by rushes. The area was a single manor at the time of the Norman Conquest. The overlordship was held by the Earls of Chester probably by the late 11th century. Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester from 1129 to 1153, gave Rushton to Norman de Verdun of Alton. Two manors existed by the early 13th century; the northern part, originally called Hugbridge, was held by Sir Hugh le Despenser (hence the name Rushton Spencer), who paid chief rent to Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester; by 1251 the rent was paid to Dieulacres Abbey, near Leek, established earlier by Ranulf de Blondeville. The southern part continued to have the Verduns as overlord; its name, Rushton James, was probably acquired from the tenant there, James de Audley. The manor house probably stood on the site of Rushton Hall Farm, which lies near the road between Congleton and Ryecroft Gate. This road, passing through Rushton James, was part of the medieval route known as the Earlsway, which linked this and other estates of the Earls of Chester. The Earlsway also passed through Leek, where the Earls of Chester were lords of the manor.A P Baggs, M F Cleverdon, D A Johnston and N J Tringham, 'Leek: Leek and Lowe', in A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 7, Leek and the Moorlands, ed.

Railway The North Staffordshire Railway company's railway line between Leek and Macclesfield opened in 1849; it ran near the village, where there was Rushton railway station. It was closed for passengers in 1960 and for freight soon afterwards. Churches Church of St Lawrence St Lawrence's Church, Rushton Spencer Interior of the church The Anglican church of St Lawrence is on high ground south-west of the village, . Because of this remote situation, it has been called \\"the chapel in the wilderness\\". It is known there was a church in Rushton Spencer in 1368: in that year, the bishop licensed the inhabitants to hold services. Until the mid 19th century the Rushton chapelry, including Rushton James, Rushton Spencer and Heaton, was dependent on Leek parish church. The chapelry became a parish in 1865. The existing building, which is Grade II* listed, has medieval timber-framing and was rebuilt in sandstone in the 17th century. It has a nave of three bays; the chancel is not separated from the nave. There is a north aisle and a vestry in the west which has a timber bell turret above. There is a large stone font, probably of the 13th century, at the west end of the nave. In 1830 and 1841 the Archdeacon of Stafford recommended the demolition of the church, its replacement to be built at Rushton Marsh. Instead, the building was repaired in the 1840s; this included dormer windows placed in the south roof. The altar is of carved oak and was installed in 1923. Work to close up a door behind the altar in 1956 revealed a flight of steps leading down to the forgotten Trafford family vault; at least one of the coffins had been plundered for its lead and silver. St Lawrence is one of the churches in the United Benefice of Cheddleton, Horton, Longsdon and Rushton Spencer, of the Diocese of Lichfield.\\"United Benefice of Cheddleton, Horton, Longsdon and Rushton Spencer\\" Retrieved 4 June 2019. Methodist church Rushton Spencer Methodist Church Methodist services were held in Rushton by 1798, and a Methodist chapel was built, in Alley Lane in Heaton near the boundary with Rushton, in 1816.

This widely used term embraces the creative lives and the achievements of several generations of Leningrad painters, sculptors, graphic artists and creators of decorative and applied art from 1917 to the early 1990s.  1917‚Äì1923  The revolutionary events of 1917‚Äì1918 changed the course of artistic life in Petrograd. They affected the Academy of Arts, exhibition and creative life, the activities of artistic associations and questions of artistic practice and theory. At the Academy of Arts students‚Äô lessons were interrupted for a year and resumed only in autumn 1918. By a decree of the Council of People's Commissars issue on 12 April 1918 the Academy of Arts in the sense of an assembly of academicians was abolished. By the same decree for the training of future artists instead of the Higher Artistic College (VKhU) the Petrograd State Free Artistic Workshops (PGSKhM) were established. The task of organizing them was entrusted to the Fine Arts department of the People's Commissariat for Education, which was headed by representatives of the \\"leftists\\". For 15 years the Academy became the arena for an intense struggle over issues of the organization of artistic education and the development of Soviet art. On 12 April 1918 the Council of People's Commissars also adopted a decree \\"on the monuments of the republic\\" that has gone down in history as \\"Lenin‚Äôs decree on monumental propaganda\\".

Drawings of Lenin made from life by the artists Nathan Altman, Isaak Brodsky, and Piotr Buchkin became the foundation for a whole genre of \\"Leniniana\\" in Soviet fine art. An innovative line of work was the festive decoration of Petrograd for the early anniversaries of the October Revolution. Among the many people involved were the artists Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin, Boris Kustodiev, Isaak Brodsky, Arkady Rylov, and Nathan Altman, the sculptors Leonid Sherwood and Sarah Lebedeva, the graphic artists Vladimir Lebedev, Mstislav Dobuzhinsky and Sergey Chekhonin, the architects Lev Rudnev and Ivan Fomin.

World fame accrued to Petrograd applied art through the agitation porcelain produced by the State Porcelain Factory (previously the Imperial Porcelain Factory, later the Leningrad Lomonosov Porcelain Factory). The factory was found to have large stocks of unpainted items and the decision was taken to employ them not simply as tableware, but primarily as a vehicle of revolutionary propaganda. The inspiration and \\"spirit\\" of the factory's artistic activities was Sergey Chekhonin, who became head of the painting department at the State Porcelain Factory in 1917. His very first works already had an agitation purpose, including the greatest of them ‚Äì the anniversary dish produced for 25 October 1918 (the coat of arms of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic worked in flowers). Sergey Chekhonin personally and others working from his drawings painted a large number of plates with slogans and the initials of the RSFSR, dishes, cups and whole services decorated with a pattern of many flowers and gilding. Besides the purely ornamental and allegorical pieces, the factory also produced from Sergey Chekhonin's drawings a series of graphic portraits of the leaders of the world proletariat as well as a large oval dish bearing the autographs of all the most prominent figures of the October Revolution.–ì–æ–ª–ª–µ—Ä–±–∞—Ö, –≠. –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–∞—Ä—Ñ–æ—Ä–æ–≤—ã–π –∑–∞–≤–æ–¥ –∏ —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–∏ // –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–µ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ, ‚Ññ 2‚Äî3. –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥, 1923.

As early as the summer of 1924 an exhibition was held at the Academy of Arts of competition entries for a monument to Lenin. First prize was awarded to a design by the architect Iosif Langbard in a revolutionary romantic style. On 7 November 1926, the ninth anniversary of the October Revolution, one of the most famous monuments to the Soviet leader was unveiled on the square by the Finland Railway Station (Lenin on the Armoured Car), sculptor Sergey Evseev, architects Vladimir Shchuko and Vladimir Gelfreykh. In 1925 a monument to the assassinated revolutionary V. Volodarsky (created by the sculptors Matvey Manizer and Lina Bleze-Manizer together with the architect Vladimir Vitman) was inaugurated, as was another to the pioneer Russian Marxist Georgy Plekhanov (sculptor Ilya Ginsburg) by the Technological Institute. In 1928 a monument to Dmitri Mendeleev, also by Ginsburg, was set up, again near the Technological Institute. In 1925 a monument to Lenin by the Leningrad sculptor Vasily Kozlov (from 1919 chairman of the Petrograd committee of sculptors, later professor of the sculpture faculty of the Academy of Arts) was set up in the southern Russian city of Taganrog. In 1927 a monument to Lenin by the same sculptor was unveiled in front of the Smolny Institute, which had been the HQ of the October Revolution. These works established a sort of canon for subsequent depictions of Lenin in Soviet art. The year 1925 was marked by a series of important events for the fine arts in Leningrad. The Institute of Artistic Culture (INKhUK) was converted into the State Institute of Artistic Culture (GINKhUK). Such prominent figures in \\"leftist\\" art as Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin and Mikhail Matyushin were recruited to head its experimental workshops. That same year –ü.

The applied art of Leningrad in the 1920s was represented by the emblematic fabrics of the Vera Slutskaya Factory, works of the Decorative Institute attached to GINKhUK and, of course, the agitation porcelain. In 1925, at a World Exhibition of Industrial Art in Paris, visitors saw 1,000 examples of this art form and it brought the artists of Leningrad gold medals from the organizers and the recognition of foreign specialists. In these works, the new content of art became consolidated through exquisite painting. It was so significant that it completely overshadowed the utilitarian nature of the tableware basis. The content of this unprecedented art was revolutionary symbols, Soviet emblems, the themes of labour and daily life, lyrical fantasies, images inspired by Russian poetry and folklore, plant motifs and flowers as a symbol of the fresh springtime blossoming of nature and the renewal of life. The artists approached the treatment of these themes with great professional skill, erudition and taste. In the opinion of Natalia Taranovskaya, from a formal viewpoint this art represented \\"an astonishing amalgam of features of Russian Classicism, romantic and folk traditions, agitation and decorative art, Suprematism and industrial design\\".–¢–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è, –ù. –í. –û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–∏ –¥–µ–∫–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ-–ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞ / –ò–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞. –í—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π –ª–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. –õ: –•—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫ –†–°–§–°–†, 1981. –°. 447. In this period the Leningrad graphic artists produced portraits of figures in the Communist and workers‚Äô movement for reproduction with massive print-runs. In 1924 artist –êlfred Eberling won a competition for the best portrait of Lenin, after which he made a drawing for banknotes that was later reproduced on Soviet 1937-series currency. In the post-war years Eberling's drawing was used as a watermark on Soviet banknotes of the 1947 and 1957 series. In the late 1920s a tendency towards the organizational consolidation of Leningrad's creative forces found expression in the creation of the \\"Zekh Khudozhnikov\\" in 1930 as a result of the merger of four bodies ‚Äì the Kuindzhi Society, the Commune of Artists, the Society of Individualist Artists and the Society of Painters.Sergei V.

Members‚Äô works were shown at the Academy of Arts, at the \\"First Citywide Exhibition of Fine Arts\\", with Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin, Mikhail Avilov, Isaak Brodsky, Arkady Rylov, Mikhail Bobyshov, Boris Kustodiev, Alexander Matveyev, Alexei Pakhomov, Alexander Vedernikov, Rudolf Frentz and others participating. A great loss for Leningrad artists was the death in 1930 of Ilya Repin, whose name was inseparably associated with the Academy of Arts and the fine art of St Petersburg‚ÄìPetrograd‚ÄìLeningrad. That event coincided with yet another reorganization of the academic institution undertaken in 1930, as a result of which the Leningrad VKhUTEIN was turned into the Institute of Proletarian Fine Art (INPII). The Moscow VKhUTEIN was united with the Leningrad institute and closed as an independent educational establishment. The man appointed as new rector of the institute was Fyodor Maslov, a former worker of the Chief Administration of Professional Education, whose name rapidly became firmly attached to a regime that saw not only further reformation of the institute, but also the effective destruction of its museum and the elimination of the department of easel painting and the architecture faculty. An advocate of the immediate \\"proletarianization\\" of art, Maslov explained the shutting down of the department of easel painting by asserting that \\"the easel painting has ceased to be a progressive form of fine art.\\"Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School. Saint Petersburg, NP-Print Edition, 2007. P. 12. Students of painting and sculpture were tasked with acquiring simple methods that would enable them to go on to produce standard works on industrial themes. There was no mention of the study of the laws of composition and perspective, of mastering the secrets of drawing and painting technique. By Maslov's order of 14 May 1930, the museum of the Academy of Arts was completely abolished. Its stocks were transferred to the Russian Museum and Hermitage, as well as museums in Kharkov, Lvov, Krasnodar, Khabarovsk, Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk, Novgorod and Feodosia.

Russian Museum Yet another reform of the Academy of Arts coincided with the heightened polemics in the early 1930s in the artistic milieu, where there were dozens of competing associations and groups of artists existing at the same time. Many of them, despite high-flown declarations, had no clear platform and were created with the sole purpose of providing their founders with means of subsistence. Others, such as the Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia ( AKhRR ‚Äì AKhR) with its almost forty branches, on the contrary laid claim to ideological leadership of the entire artistic movement. In the late 1920s, the purging of the AKhR of \\"bourgeois elements\\" resulted in the exclusion of the artists Mikhail Avilov, Isaak Brodsky and Gavriil Gorelov. Later Abram Arkhipov, Rudolf Frentz, Piotr Buchkin, Dmitry Kardovsky, Nikolai Dormidontov and other major painters quit the AKhR. The \\"Brodsky‚Äôs Affair\\", which was dealt with by a special commission of the People's Commissariat for Education, attracted widespread attention. It revealed a picture of intrigues and embittered group fighting, reflecting the abnormal situation that had arisen within art.Sergei V. Ivanov. The Leningrad School of Painting. Essays on the History. St Petersburg, ARKA Gallery Publishing, 2019. P.29. Another event that aroused a public response was the scandalous 1931 exhibition in the Russian Museum, which featured \\"black walls\\" hung with paintings that the exhibition organizers described as \\"seditious\\". Beneath each work there was a special label revealing its \\"bourgeois essence\\". In response, within the walls of the Academy of Arts and among Leningrad's artistic community opposition to this deleterious policy for art took shape, also producing resolute criticism of Maslov's regime.–ò. –ê. –ë—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–∏–π. –ò—Å–∞–∞–∫ –ò–∑—Ä–∞–∏–ª–µ–≤–∏—á –ë—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–∏–π. –ú: –ò–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ, 1973. –°. 322‚Äî324. In the spring of 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party adopted a resolution \\"On the reconstruction of literary and artistic organizations\\". The existing literary and artistic organizations were dissolved to be replaced by single creative unions of artists, writers, theatrical personnel and composers. On 2 August 1932, at a general meeting of Leningrad artists who were members of various societies, a single Leningrad Regional Union of Soviet Artists (LOSSKh) was formed. Painter Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin was elected its first chairman. Soon, by resolution of the Leningrad City Soviet, LOSSKh was given the use of the historical building of the former Society for the Encouragement of the Arts at 38, Herzen Street (today once again Bolshaya Morskaya Street).–õ. –°. –ö–æ–Ω–æ–≤–∞. –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–∏–π –°–æ—é–∑ —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. –ö—Ä–∞—Ç–∫–∞—è —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∫–∞ 1932‚Äì2009 // –ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–∏–µ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–µ–¥—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Ç–µ—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏. –í—ã–ø—É—Å–∫ 16. –°–ü–±, 2009. –°. 72. The city assumed all expenses for the removal of the existing tenants and the refurbishment of the building. The LOSSKh became the creative and professional body that for a period of 60 years united Leningrad artists of all sorts ‚Äì painters, sculptors, graphic artists, monumental artists, specialists in decorative and applied art, film and theatrical designers and also art historians. The union organized creative, professional and exhibition activities and settled matters relating to the social welfare and material condition of artists. The LOSSKh filled its ranks by inducting the members of the dissolved artistic associations and groups, and later with graduates from the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (the former Academy of Arts) and other educational establishments in the city. The first city-level exhibition of Leningrad artists after the formation of the LOSSKh took place in 1935. The display included works by 146 painters, 59 sculptors, 66 graphic artists and 17 porcelain artists.–ê. –ì. –†–∞—Å–∫–∏–Ω. –°–≤—è–∑—å –≤—Ä–µ–º—ë–Ω / –°–≤—è–∑—å –≤—Ä–µ–º—ë–Ω. –ö–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥ –≤—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ –¶–í–ó \\"–ú–∞–Ω–µ–∂\\". –°–ü–±: 1997. –°. 9.

In October 1932 the All-Union Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars adopted a resolution \\"On the creation of the Academy of Arts\\" The Leningrad Institute of Proletarian Fine Art was transformed into the Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (LIZhSA) and a line was drawn under a 15-year period of continuous transformation of that educational establishment. Still it required a few more years to gather the scattered teaching forces and construct artistic education anew. This process was begun by the Academy's new director, the sculptor Alexander Matveyev, and his deputy for educational work, Professor of Painting Alexander Savinov. They invited Dmitry Kardovsky, Alexander Osmerkin, Semion Abugov, Eugene Lanceray, Pavel Shillingovsky, Isaak Brodsky, and Nikolai Radlov to join the faculty and between them those professors did much to revive the Academy's role in training art specialists. In 1934 Isaak Brodsky, a pupil of Ilya Repin, was appointed director of the institute and of the All-Russian Academy of Arts (VAKh). Brodsky enlisted to teach at the institute some major artists and educators: Konstantin Yuon, Pavel Naumov, Boris Ioganson, Alexander Lubimov, Rudolf Frentz, Piotr Buchkin, Nikolai Petrov, Victor Sinaysky, Vasily Shukhaev, Dmitry Kiplik, Nikolay Punin, Vasily Meshkov, Mikhail Bernshtein, Yefim Cheptsov, Ivan Bilibin, Matvey Manizer, Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva, Alexei Karev, Leonid Ovsannikov, Sergei Priselkov, Ivan Stepashkin, Konstantin Rudakov and more. Training for the future artists was founded upon mastery of drawing, composition and painting, as well as a study of the history of art. The system of individual creative studios in which students continued their education after the second year was reinstated. In the painting faculty the studios were headed by Isaak Brodsky, Boris Ioganson, Vasily Yakovlev, Dmitry Kardovsky, Alexander Osmerkin, Alexander Savinov, Rudolf Frentz, Pavel Shillingovsky and Mikhail Bobyshov.Sergei V.

Many of them became not only eminent painters, but also educators, who taught more than one generation of young artists. Pavel Filonov Shock-workers. 1935 One of the consequences of the consolidation of creative forces and the reform of the Academy was a strengthening of the role of easel and monumental painting and, particularly, the thematic picture among the other types and genres of Leningrad art. Such works firmly occupied a central place at exhibitions. Among the creations of Leningrad artists in the 1930s, critics single out the paintings Girl in a Sport Shirt (1932), Woman ‚Äì metro's builder with a drill (1937), The Komsomol on a War Footing (1933), Sergei Kirov Taking a Parade of Athletes (1935) and Female Delegates (1939) by Alexander Samokhvalov, Bird Cherry in a Glass (1932) and Alarm (1934) by Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin, Portrait of the Artist Tatyana Shishmareva (1934) by Vladimir Lebedev, In Green Banks (1938) by Arkady Rylov, Nude (1937) by Nikolai Tyrsa, Portrait of Maxim Gorky (1937) by Isaak Brodsky, Self-Portrait (1933) by Kazimir Malevich, Mikhil Yudin, a Hero of the Soviet Union, Visiting TankmenSergei V.

(1938) by Aleksandr Laktionov, Shock Workers (1935) by Pavel Filonov, and the urban landscapes of Vladimir Grinberg, Nikolai Lapshin and Alexander Vedernikov. The most famous works by Leningrad sculptors include the monument to Kirov in Leningrad (1938) created by Nikolai Tomsky, the sculptural composition Lenin in Razliv (1935) by Veniamin Pinchuk, monuments of Lenin in Petrozavodsk (1933), Minsk (1933) and Ulyanovsk (1940), to Chapayev in Samara (1932), and to Taras Shevchenko in Kharkov (1935) and Kiev (1938) by Matvey Manizer, and the same sculptor's monument to the victims of 9 January 1905 in Leningrad (1931). In the mid-1930s in Leningrad a unique system of elementary and secondary art education for children took shape in Leningrad. In 1934 a School of Young Talents was organized under the auspices of the Academy of Arts, which was soon transformed into the Secondary Art School (SKhSh) attached to the Academy of Arts. It was also given a boarding section. Among the school's alumni in the pre-war years were the future distinguished Leningrad artists and sculptors Alexei Eriomin, Vecheslav Zagonek, Mikhail Anikushin, Nikolai Kochukov, Iya Venkova, Evgenia Antipova, Anatoli Levitin, Yuri Tulin, Dmitry Buchkin, Vladimir Chekalov, Marina Kozlovskaya, Elena Kostenko, Abram Grushko, Oleg Lomakin, Vera Lubimova and many others. Children's art schools and studios appeared attached to Leningrad's Palace of Pioneers and in the majority of the city's districts. Besides drawing they taught the basics of painting, composition and the history of the arts. The lessons were given by professional artists, some of them graduates of the Academy. In the 1930s the development of fine art and artistic education was accompanied by arguments and debates about the course and methods of training young artists, about genres, about the attitude to tendencies in European art and about the method of Socialist Realism. These discussions, into which young artists also became drawn, furthered the revelation of creative personalities and were an important factor in the formation of Leningrad art. The successes of Leningrad artists in the field of book and easel graphic art were due to the works of George Vereysky, Nikolau Radlov, Pavel Basmanov, Vladimir Konashevich, Nikolai Tyrsa, Alexander Samokhvalov, Eugene Kibryck, Alexei Pakhomov, Vladimir Lebedev, Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva, Pavel Shillingovsky, Yuri Vasnetsov, Eugene Charushin, –öonstantin Rudakov, Gennady Epifanov, Sergei Mochalov, Ivan Bilibin and others. Alexander Samokhvalov's illustrations for Saltykov-Shchedrin's novel The History of a Town were awarded the grand prix at the 1937 Paris Exposition. At that same event a gold medal was awarded to Vladimir Konashevich's illustrations for Abb√© Pr√©vost's novella Manon Lescaut. Among the notable achievements of Soviet graphic art in this period are –öonstantin Rudakov's illustrations for Maupassant's Bel Ami and Eugene Kibryck's illustrations for Romain Rolland's Colas Breugnon and Charles de Coster's Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel.–ú–∞—Ç–∞—Ñ–æ–Ω–æ–≤, –í. –°. –†–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–µ –ª–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∫–∏ / –ò–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞. –í—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π –ª–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. –õ: –•—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫ –†–°–§–°–†, 1981. –°. 433.

The first train carrying them left for the East on 1 July. An even greater quantity of museum items were moved into temporary storage places. Tremendous work was carried out to protect and camouflage sculptural monuments, military, civic and industrial objects. The production of posters and wartime leaflets began. Artists participated in the construction of defensive installations and served in air raid defence units. Publication of the \\"Boyevoy karandash\\" (\\"Fighting Pencil\\") was resumed. As early as 24 June Vladimir Serov's poster We Have Beaten, Are Beating and Will Beat! appeared on the streets of Leningrad and in the window of the former Yeliseyev Shop on Nevsky Prospekt the first issue of the \\"TASS Windows\\" was put on display.–ë–ª–æ–∫–∞–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–∏–∫. –ñ–∏–≤–æ–ø–∏—Å—å –∏ –≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∫–∞ –±–ª–æ–∫–∞–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏. –°–ü–±: 2005. –°. 7.

In the very hardest months of the siege, to preserve their lives a proportion of the artists were placed under barracks conditions in the Academy and in the premises of the Artists‚Äô Union at 38, Herzen Street. In December 1941, 38 students presented diploma works at the Academy, some of them being temporarily recalled from the front to do so. In February 1942 staff and students of the Academy and Secondary School of Art were evacuated to Samarkand, where the educational process continued. The institute returned from evacuation on 18 July 1944, while on 14 July it was given the name of Ilya Repin by resolution of the government of the USSR. During the war close to every third member of the LOSSKh perished. Authors differ on the exact numbers. Olga Roitenberg, for example, writes about 550 lives lost to the war and the siege, while admitting that this sad figure is far from definitive.–û. –†–æ–π—Ç–µ–Ω–±–µ—Ä–≥. –û–Ω–∏ –ø–æ–≥–∏–±–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ –≤–æ–π–Ω–µ // –ò—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ. 1985, ‚Ññ 5. –°. 19‚Äî26. Among the dead were Alexander Savinov, Pavel Filonov, Pavel Shillingovsky, Ivan Bilibin, Nikolai Lapshin, Vladimir Grinberg, Nikolai Tyrsa and Alexei Karev. Even more devastating were the losses among young artists and students. Yet the Artists‚Äô Union was gaining new members, among them the young Nikolai Timkov, Sergei Osipov, Evgenia Baykova, Gleb Savinov, Nikolai Pilshikov and other Leningrad painters and graphic artists who would become well known in future. It is symbolic that in October 1943 medal number one Medal \\"For the Defence of Leningrad\\" was awarded to the Academy of Arts student Nikolai Pilshikov (1914‚Äì1983), who entered the war as an air force pilot. While he flew missions on a par with others, from the first weeks of the war his gifted portrait sketches of the defenders of Leningrad's skies became widely known in the city. Later postcards were made of his works and in early 1942 the Iskusstvo publishing house put out an album of Pilshikov's portraits of celebrated air aces. It was presented along with Hero of the Soviet Union certificates to servicemen on the Leningrad front. The gallery of heroes that the artist created is of great historical and artistic value. They include the pilot Piotr Kharitonov, who was one of the first in the war to be awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, Timur Frunze, the son of a Civil War hero, the famous female pilot Valentina Grizodubova, twice Hero of the Soviet Union Piotr Pokryshev and the defender of the \\"Road of Life\\" Alexei Sevastyanov. In 1942, on the recommendation of George Vereysky and Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva, Nikolai Pilshikovwas accepted into the LSSKh.–î—é–∂–µ–Ω–∫–æ, –Æ. –ú–µ–¥–∞–ª—å –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä –æ–¥–∏–Ω \\"–ó–∞ –æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—É –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞\\" // –ò—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ. 1985, ‚Ññ 5. –°. 24‚Äî27.

The largest wartime exhibition, devoted to \\"The Heroic Defence of Leningrad\\", opened on 30 April 1944 in Solyany Lane and gave the start to the legendary Museum of the Defence of Leningrad. Then in February 1945, in the same place, on the basis of the former Baron Stieglitz College of Technical Drawing, the Leningrad College of Art and Industry was opened, which soon turned into the Mukhina Higher College of Art and Industry. The college embarked on the training of specialist artists to restore the palace and park ensembles of Leningrad and its suburbs destroyed in the war. Among the works created by Leningrad artists during the war, critics particularly note the paintings Self-Portrait (1942) and To the Outside World (1945) by Yaroslav Nikolaev, Partisan Detachment.

The war had an enormous impact on Soviet society and its fine art, determining many important aspects of its development for decades to come. That period also engendered a special attitude to Leningrad and Leningraders. People constantly expected something significant and profound from Leningrad artists, some particularly honest civic position, something for others to live up to. The exceptional character of the military and human drama that the city experienced had its effect on the work of Leningrad artists, who were destined to write a special chapter in the post-war history of fine art.–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤, –°. –í. –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∞—è –û—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞ –∏ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ª–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–π —à–∫–æ–ª—ã –∂–∏–≤–æ–ø–∏—Å–∏  1946‚Äì60  The make-up of the Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists (LSSKh) and of participants in post-war Leningrad exhibitions was substantially rejuvenated by LIZhSA graduates of the pre-war years, as well as those who were only now able to complete studies interrupted by the war. They were Mikhail Anikushin, Nukolai Andretsov, Taisia Afonina, Evgenia Baykova, Konstantin Belokurov, Piotr Belousov, Olga Bogaevskaya, Anatoli Vasiliev, Nina Veselova, Igor Veselkin, Rostislav Vovkushevsky, Ivan Godlevsky, –úeta Drayfild, Alexander Dashkevich, Yuri Neprintsev, Gleb Savinov, Nikolai Timkov, Vasily Sokolov, Sergei Osipov, Mikhail Natarevich, Evsey Moiseenko, Andrei Mylnikov, Genrikh Pavlovsky, Lia Ostrova, –úikhail Zheleznov, Lev Orekhov, Alexei Eriomin, Elena Skuin, Yuri Podlasky, Tatiana Kopnina, Nikita Medovikov, Victor Teterin, Nikolai Mukho, Alexander Pushnin, Evgenia Antipova, Alexei Mozhaev, Nadezhda Shteinmiller, Arseny Semionov, Alexander Koroviakov, Valery Pimenov, Maria Rudnitskaya, Yuri Tulin, Nikolai Brandt, Semion Rotnitsky, and many others. From that time on they were destined to become the vanguard of Leningrad art. In the 1950s the (LSSKh) took in a large contingent of artists who had not begun their studies until after the war, including front-line veterans, who were permitted to enter the institute without examinations. This new influx included Leonid Baykov, Nikolai Baskakov, Dmitry Belyaev, Sergei Buzulukov, Nikolai Galakhov, Abram Grushko, Vecheslav Zagonek, Alexei Eriomin, Boris Korneev, Marina Kozlovskaya, Elena Kostenko, Anna Kostina, Yaroslav Krestovsky, Valeria Larina, Anatoli Levitin, Boris Lavrenko, Ivan Lavsky, Piotr Litvinsky, Oleg Lomakin, Mikhail Kaneev, Yuri Khukhrov, Maya Kopitseva, Engels Kozlov, Edvard Virzhikovsky, Leonid Kabachek, Eugene Maltsev, Konstantin Molteninov, Anatoli Nenartovich, Avenir Parkhomenko, George Pesis, Vsevolod Petrov-Maslakov, Nikolai Pozdneev, Igor Razdrogin, Victor Reykhet, Vladimir Sakson, Vladimir Seleznev, Vladimir Tokarev, Mikhail Trufanov, Boris Ugarov, Leonid Fokin, Piotr Fomin, Vladimir Chekalov, and many others. While continuing to work on the narrative-directorial side of painting, they began to make more active use of the specific devices of their own art form, above all colour and plasticity. Orientation on the Itinerants was increasingly supplemented by an interest in such figures as Konstantin Korovin, Valentin Serov and the members of the Union of Russian Artists with their culture of plein-air painting and studies from life. Works from 1945‚Äì49, including some diploma pieces by Academy graduates, saw the first real successes in artistically generalizing the theme of the great feat accomplished by the entire nation in the war. Among them were In Memory of the Heroes of the Baltic Fleet (1946) by Andrei Mylnikov, The Girls of the Donbass (1946) by Taisia Afonina, The Road of Life (1946) by Alexei Kuznetsov, German Prisoners (1946) by Piotr Puko, The Victors (1947) by Franz Zaborovsky, A Wounded Commander (1947) by Alexander Koroviakov, General Dovator (1947) by Evsey Moiseenko, Landing Force (1947) by Elena Tabakova and Liberated Kishinev (1947) by Stepan Privedentsev. In Zagorsk in 1947, Aleksandr Laktionov, a graduate of Isaak Brodsky's studio, completed the painting Letter from the Front (Tretyakov Gallery, Stalin Prize 1st class for 1948) that has gone down in the history of the nation's art as an astonishingly bright image of the Victory, so desired and close. In 1951 another of Isaak Brodsky's pupils, Yuri Neprintsev, produced the no less famous work Rest after Battle (Tretyakov Gallery, Stalin Prize 1st class for 1952). The theme of post-war reconstruction found reflection in the paintings In the Peaceful Fields (1950, Russian Museum, Stalin Prize 3rd class for 1951) by Andrei Mylnikov, Rebirth (1950) by Mikhail Natarevich, Portrait of the Composer Solovyev-Sedoi (1950) by Joseph Serebriany, Leningrad to the Builders of Communism. In the Hydro- Turbine Shop of the Stalin Works (1951) by Nina Veselova, Vecheslav Zagonek, Alexander Pushnin, Yefim Rubin and Yuri Tulin, Here the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station Will Be (1951) by Nikolai Galakhov, Two Great Building Projects. A Meeting of the Scientific and Technical Board of the Elektrosila Works (1951) by Leonid Tkachenko, An Exchange of Stakhanovite Experience (1951) by Anatoli Levitin, and Collective Farm Spring (1951) by Boris Ugarov. The artists shared the same interests and problems as the people. They strove to make their contribution to the general efforts, not to stand apart. This is indicated by the discussions and deliberations that took place in 1945‚Äì1947 in the Leningrad Artists‚Äô Union. They raised pressing issues of the artistic standard of works and the provision of commissions, studios, and art materials.–°—Ç–µ–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –æ—Ç—á—ë—Ç –≤—ã—Å—Ç—É–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–µ–¥–∞ –ù. –ù. –ü—É–Ω–∏–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞ –æ–±—Å—É–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≤—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ —ç—Ç—é–¥–∞. 11 –§–µ–≤—Ä–∞–ª—è 1945 –≥–æ–¥–∞ // –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ê—Ä—Ö–∏–≤ –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä—ã –∏ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞. –°–ü–±: –§.78. –û–ø.1. –î.58.–°—Ç–µ–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –æ—Ç—á—ë—Ç –¥–∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å–∏–∏ –ø–æ –æ–±—Å—É–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—é –¥–æ–∫–ª–∞–¥–∞ –ù. –ù. –ü—É–Ω–∏–Ω–∞ \\"–ò–º–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∏–æ–Ω–∏–∑–º –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–Ω—ã\\" 3 –º–∞—è 1946 –≥–æ–¥–∞ // –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ê—Ä—Ö–∏–≤ –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä—ã –∏ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞. –°–ü–±: –§.78. –û–ø.1. –î.73.–°—Ç–µ–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –æ—Ç—á—ë—Ç –∑–∞—Å–µ–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –ü—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –õ–°–°–• –æ –∑–∞–¥–∞—á–∞—Ö –°–æ—é–∑–∞ –≤ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ —Å –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏–µ–º —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª–∞ –≤ –ì–†–ú –∏ –æ–±—Å—É–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã –∫–ª—É–±–∞ —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. 16 –∞–ø—Ä–µ–ª—è 1947 –≥–æ–¥–∞ // –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ê—Ä—Ö–∏–≤ –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä—ã –∏ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞. –°–ü–±: –§.78. –û–ø.1. –î.99. In the contracted works of painters and sculptors, a significant place was occupied by the historical revolutionary theme.

At the same time, the facts demonstrate that the role of works belonging to this genre was not dominant in the fine art of the 1950s. For example, of the 177 works by Leningrad painters presented at the All-Union Art Exhibition marking the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution (Moscow, 1957) only ten were devoted to the Lenin theme (5.5%). For comparison, eight paintings were still lifes, while 61 (34%) were landscapes.–í—Å–µ—Å–æ—é–∑–Ω–∞—è —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≤—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞, –ø–æ—Å–≤—è—â—ë–Ω–Ω–∞—è 40-–ª–µ—Ç–∏—é –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–π –û–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—å—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–∏. –ö–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥. –ú: –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫, 1957. –°. 7‚Äî91. Among the most significant achievements of Leningrad artists in this period, critics name the paintings Furnaceman (1955) by Mikhail Trufanov, The Lena. 1912 (1957) by Yuri Tulin, Campfires (1957) by Vasily Sokolov, University Embankment (1957) by Gleb Savinov, The First Cavalry Army (1957) by Evsey Moiseenko, A Warm Day (1957) by Anatoli Levitin, Portrait of the Collective Farm Chairman M. Dolgov (1959) by Nina Veselova, Morning (1960) by Vecheslav Zagonek, The Opening Up of the North (1960) by Boris Korneev, They Were Beginning the Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station (1960) by Yuri Podlasky, In the Leningrad Philharmonia. 1942 (1959) Portrait of F. Bezuglov, Smelter of the Krasny Vyborzhets Works (1960) by Joseph Serebriany, and Holiday in Voronovo (1960) by Nina Veselova and Leonid Kabachek. They giftedly embody the image of contemporaries in the era of Khrushchev's \\"thaw\\" with its conceptions about the revolution, the past and present, with the tremendous scale of construction projects and the achievements of Soviet science and technology. In this period a number of landscape painters positively attracted the public's attention, including Vladimir Ovchinnikov, Nikolai Timkov, Sergei Osipov, George Tatarnikov, Dmitry Maevsky, Vecheslav Zagonek, Nikolai Galakhov, Alexander Guliaev and Vsevolod Bazhenov. In their work panoramic landscapes traditional for Russian painting became popular. And although in the first post-war decade many artists continued to evolve in a direction marked out in their student days, their efforts to vary the painterly-plastic devices used to produce an image became ever more obvious. The circle of traditions that Leningrad artists were drawing upon grew wider. Edging out the historical painting, there was a rapid upsurge in this period in portraiture, the still life and genre pieces, while the study was reinstated in its rights. As a result, such talented painters as Evgenia Antipova, Vladimir Tokarev, Lev Russov, Oleg Lomakin, Mikhail Trufanov, Boris Korneev, Arseny Semionov, Victor Teterin, Elena Skuin, Gevork Kotiantz, and Maya Kopitseva were able to realize themselves in those genres. Their work became a noticeable phenomenon in painting in the 1960s‚Äì80s, substantially enriching it in terms of genre and style. In 1946‚Äì1952 the fine arts in Leningrad experienced first-hand the consequences of the Communist Party Central Committee's resolution on the magazines Zvezda and Leningrad and the \\"Leningrad Affair\\". Crude attempts at administrative intervention and savage repressions had a painful effect on the artistic intelligentsia. Professor Alexander Osmerkin was dismissed as head of a studio at the LIZhSA. The art scholar Nikolay Punin was removed from his post and sent to the Gulag, where he soon died. Everything connected with the heroic defence of Leningrad came under a taboo. The museum of the defence, filled with the works of artists and, in essence, created by them, was closed. Art, including the fine arts, was subjected to senseless regulation.

The annual exhibitions of Leningrad artists that were held in the halls of the LSSKh and the Russian Museum had up to 600 participants. Among the largest were the \\"Summary Exhibition of Works by Leningrad Artists\\" (1948, LSSKh ), the \\"Summary Exhibition of Works of Painting, Sculpture and Graphic Art for 1947‚Äì48\\" (1949, LSSKh), the \\"Exhibition of Works by Leningrad Artists Marking the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution\\" (1957, Russian Museum), the autumn exhibitions of 1956 and 1958 in the LSSKh and the \\"200 Years of the USSR Academy of Arts\\" exhibition (1957, Academy of Arts). Major events were the personal exhibitions of Mikhail Bobyshov (1952), Victor Oreshnikov (1955), Alexander Savinov (1956), Nikolai Timkov, Alexander Rusakov, –úikhail Platunov (all in 1957), Yaroslav Nikolaev and Piotr Belousov (1958). Leningrad art was strongly represented at the leading exhibitions in Moscow, including the All-Union Jubilee Exhibition of 1957, the exhibitions \\"40 Years of the Soviet Armed Forces\\" and \\"40 Years of the Komsomol\\" in 1958, as well as the first republican exhibition \\"Soviet Russia\\" in 1960. Leningrad artists made a major contribution to the preparation and work of the first All-Union Congress of Soviet Artists in Moscow in 1957 and to the foundation of the Artists‚Äô Union of Russia in 1960. That same year the LSSKh was transformed into the Leningrad branch of the Artists‚Äô Union of the RSFSR (LOSKh RSFSR). In 1958 the Khudozknik RSFSR (\\"Artist of the RSFSR\\") publishing house was formed in Leningrad. Construction of fixed studios and housing for artists was expanded. The greatest achievements of Leningrad sculptors were the monument to Pushkin on the Square of Arts (1957, sculptor Mikhail Anikushin), the memorial ensemble at the Piskarevskoye Cemetery (1960, sculptors Vera Isaeva, Boris Kapliansky, –êbram Malakhin, –úikhail Whyman, Robert Taurit, Maria Kharlamova and architects Eugene Levinson, Alexander Vasiliev)–ë—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–∏–π, –ò. –ê. –ü–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –≥–µ—Ä–æ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º –∑–∞—â–∏—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞. –ü–∏—Å–∫–∞—Ä—ë–≤—Å–∫–æ–µ –º–µ–º–æ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –∫–ª–∞–¥–±–∏—â–µ-–º—É–∑–µ–π. –õ: –•—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫ –†–°–§–°–†, 1964. and the monument to Alexander Griboyedov (1959, sculptor Vsevolod Lishev).

Among the leading figures in this field critics name Yuri Muntian, Maria Vertuzaeva, Leyda Yurgen, Lidia Smirnova, Eduard Krimer, Ekaterina Yanovskaya and Helle Pild. Outstanding in ceramics are the works of Victor Olshevsky and in jewellery those of Utha Paas-Alexandrova. A substantial contribution to the country's decorative and applied art was made by the porcelain services and vases of Alexei Vorobievsky and Ivan Riznich, the table services of Alexandra Schekotikhina-Pototskaya and the works of Anna Leporskaya, –úikhail Mokh, Serafima Yakovleva, Vladimir Semionov, and Vladimir Gorodetsky.

By the late 1980s it united more than 3,000 professional artists in various fields ‚Äì painters, sculptors, graphic artists and specialists in decorative and applied art. There were separate sections for monumental artists, artistic photographers and artist-restorers. Another large group of artists was brought together by the Combine of Painting and Design Art (KZhOI) and other production subdivisions of the Leningrad branch of the Art Fund of the RSFSR. Amateur artists came together around the fine arts studios that existed in all districts of the city, based primarily in Houses and Palaces of Culture and clubs. The links of this system interacted, not only providing broad involvement in fine arts activities, but also serving as route of entry into the profession for the most creatively gifted young people. From the early 1960s artists‚Äô living and working conditions changed substantially. Official purchases of works increased and the system of contracts was in proved. From 1966 guaranteed payment for artists‚Äô work on a par with the average industrial wage was introduced in the LOSKh. This innovation affected around 500 practitioners in all branches of the fine arts. In the 1970s a new exhibition hall of the Artists‚Äô Union was opened in the Okhta area of the city as well as the Manege Central Exhibition Hall. In 1961 artists were presented with the celebrated House on Pesochny Embankment, containing 50 apartments and 100 art studios for sculptors, painters and graphic artists. Construction of housing and permanent studios for artists was launched on Vasilyevsky Island and the Okhta, in the town of Pushkin and other parts of the city. The House of Artists‚Äô Creativity in Staraya Ladoga was enlarged and reconstructed, becoming a favourite place for Leningrad painters to work. In this period many artists worked at the \\"Academic Dacha\\", at the RSFSR Artists‚Äô Union's creative centres in Gurzuf in the Crimea, on Lakes Baikal and Seliger and the spa town of Goryachy Klyuch in the Northern Caucasus. A whole system of art exhibitions was established, in which a central place was taken by the Leningrad \\"zonal exhibitions\\". They preceded the republic-level \\"Soviet Russia\\" exhibitions. The first \\"Leningrad\\" zonal exhibition was held in 1964 and became one of the largest presentations of the city's fine art in the whole of its history.–õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥. –ó–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –≤—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞. –õ: –•—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫ –†–°–§–°–†, 1965. Subsequently, zonal exhibitions were held regularly and contracts were made for works to be produced for them. It was from the zonal and republican exhibitions that the bulk of purchases were made by museums, the Ministry of Culture and the Art Fund of Russian Federation. Most significant in terms of numbers of participants and the quality of works were \\"Exhibition of the Works of Leningrad Artists 1961\\" (Russian Museum), a series of exhibitions under the title \\"Our Contemporary\\" in the Russian Museum, including the 1975 Zonal exhibition, \\"Across Our Native Land\\" (1972, Russian Museum), \\"Leningrad Fine Art\\" (1976, Moscow), \\"Art Belongs to the People\\" (1977, Manege Central Exhibition Hall), \\"The Zonal Exhibition of Works by Leningrad Artists 1980\\" (Manege Central Exhibition Hall), and the retrospective exhibition \\"Liberated Person\\" (1987, Russian Museum). The exhibition \\"Contemporary Leningrad Art\\" (1988), (Saint Petersburg ManegeManege Central Exhibition Hall) brought together for the first time members of the Leningrad branch of the Artists‚Äô Union, primarily belonging to the \\"leftist\\" wing, amateur artists and representatives of \\"unofficial art\\". Each year there were traditional spring and autumn exhibitions, and, from the mid-1970s, veterans‚Äô exhibitions. Among the group exhibitions that caused a stir were \\"The Exhibition of 11 artists\\" (1972), \\"The Exhibition of 9 artists\\" (1976), the three-man exhibition of Sergei Osipov, Arseny Semionov, and –öirill Guschin (1977, LOSKh) and an exhibition of 26 Moscow and Leningrad artists (1990, Manege Central Exhibition Hall). Among the personal exhibitions (all held in the LOSKh unless otherwise shown) that became events in the city's artistic life were those of Piotr Buchkin (1961), Alexander Samokhvalov (1963), Nikolai Timkov (1964, 1975), Vladimir Gorb (1967), Victor Oreshnikov (1974, Academy of Arts), Leonid Kabachek (1975), Engels Kozlov (1976), Alexander Vedernikov (1977), Yuri Neprintsev (1979, Academy of Arts), Vladimir Tokarev (1980), Elena Skuin (1980), Yaroslav Krestovsky (1981), Evsey Moiseenko (1982, Russian Museum), Mikhail Natarevich (1982), Sergei Zakharov (1984), Vitaly Tulenev (1985), Boris Lavrenko (1986, Academy of Arts), Yaroslav Nikolaev (1986), Olga Bogaevskaya (1987), Piotr Belousov (1987, Academy of Arts), Nikolai Galakhov (1988), Vladimir Ovchinnikov (1988), Alexander Semionov (1988), Boris Ugarov (1988, –ì–†–ú), Vecheslav Zagonek (1990, Academy of Arts), Sergei Osipov (1991), Gleb Savinov (1991), Semion Rotnitsky (1991) and a number of others. The fine art of Leningrad was invariably represented broadly at republican, All-Union and foreign exhibitions of Soviet art. In 1974‚Äì75 the city's Gaza and Nevsky Palaces of Culture were the venues for events that went down in the history of the Leningrad underground as the first permitted exhibitions of non-conformist artists and gave the ironic name \\"gazonevshchina\\" to one of the phenomena in the artistic life of the 1970s and 1980s. In 1982 the Fellowship of Experimental Fine Art (TEII), an informal grouping of predominantly \\"leftist\\" artists, came into being. The TEII's first exhibition took place that same year. The creators of the TEII declared their aim to be \\"uniting artists to improve their work in an atmosphere of creativity and mutual support founded on democratic traditions\\".–í—Ä–µ–º—è –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω. –ò—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ 1960‚Äî1985 –≤ –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–º –°–æ—é–∑–µ. / –ê–ª—å–º–∞–Ω–∞—Ö. –í—ã–ø.140. –°–ü–±: Palace Editions, 2006. C. 381. The TEII existed until 1988. The 1960s and 1970s were a period of true maturity for Leningrad painting. Those years saw many major figures, including Evsey Moiseenko, Vecheslav Zagonek, Boris Korneev, Gleb Savinov, Nikolai Timkov, Sergei Osipov, Leonid Kabachek, Arseny Semionov, Vladimir Ovchinnikov, Alexei Eriomin, Nikolai Pozdneev, Mikhail Kaneev, Maya Kopitseva and Ivan Savenko, at the height of their creative powers. The works of Victor Teterin, Yaroslav Krestovsky, German Yegoshin, Evgenia Antipova, Vasily Golubev, Vitaly Tulenev, Leonid Tkachenko, Valery Vatenin and Zaven Arshakuny reflected the spirit of search and change in its Leningrad dimension. From strict objectivism founded on the experience of Russian realist painting of the second half of the 19th century, artists turned to a search for individually striking form in painting, affirming the idea of the value of a creative personality's inner world. At the same time the leaders of the \\"left wing\\" of the LOSKh remained within the mainstream of the traditional Russian understanding of the purpose of art, which insisted upon a concept having meaningfulness and moral purpose. Among the best known works from this period are the paintings ¬´Leningrad Woman (In 1941)¬ª (1961) by Boris Ugarov, Morning (1961), ¬´The Storm Has Passed¬ª (1961) and ¬´The Bird-Cherry Is in Blossom¬ª (1964) by Vecheslav Zagonek, ¬´Parting¬ª (1975) and the ¬´Spain triptych¬ª (1979) by Andrei Mylnikov, ¬´The Reds Have Arrived¬ª (1961), ¬´Mothers, Sisters¬ª (1967), ¬´Sweet Cherries¬ª (1969) and ¬´Victory¬ª (1972) by Evsey Moiseenko, ¬´About Tomorrow¬ª (1961), ¬´Trains Are Taking the Lads Away¬ª (1965) and ¬´Thoughts¬ª (1970) by Leonid Kabachek, ¬´Maternal Thoughts¬ª (1969) by Alexei Eriomin, ¬´Black Gold¬ª (1969) by Engels Kozlov, ¬´Victory Day¬ª (1975) and ¬´The First Tractor¬ª (1980) by Gleb Savinov, ¬´Watchmakers¬ª (1968) by Yaroslav Krestovsky, ¬´Portrait of Shostakovich¬ª (1964) and ¬´Sviatoslav Richter¬ª (1972) by Joseph Serebriany, ¬´Childhood Street¬ª (1972) by Vitaly Tulenev, ¬´Happy Woman¬ª (1969) by Andrey Yakovlev, ¬´Portrait of Boris Piotrovsky¬ª (1971) by Victor Oreshnikov, ¬´Self-Portrait¬ª (1974) by Larisa Kirillova, ¬´Russian Winter. Hoarfrost¬ª (1969) by Nikolai Timkov, and ¬´The Leningrad Symphony, Mravinsky Conducting¬ª (1980) by Lev Russov. The achievements of Leningrad sculpture of the 1960s‚Äì80s are associated with the names of Mikhail Anikushin, Vera Isaevs, Levon Lazarev, Boris Kaplansky, –úoisey Whyman, Vasily Stamov, Lubov Kholina, Maria Kharlamova, Nikolai Kochukov, Iya Venkova, Vasily Astapov, Valentina Rybalko, Grigory Yastrebenetsky and others. Among the best known works are the monument to Maxim Gorky (1968, sculptor Vera Isaeva, architect Efim Levinson), the monument to Giacomo Quarenghi (1967, sculptor Levon Lazarev, architect –úikhail Meysel), the monument to Lenin on Moscow Square (1970, sculptor Mikhail Anikushin), the memorial to The Heroic Defenders of Leningrad on Victory Square (1975, sculptor Mikhail Anikushin, architects Vasily Kamensky, Sergei Speransky), the monument to Nikolai Nekrasov (1971, sculptor –úikhail Eidlin, architect Vladimir Vasilkovsky). This period saw development in all the forms of graphic art traditional for Leningrad: book illustration, etching, lithography, linocut, drawing and the poster. In book illustration deserved fame accrued to the works of Yuri Vasnetsov, Eugene Charushin, Alexei Pakhomov , Gennady Epifanov, Boris Kalaushin, Oleg Pochtenny, –öirill Ovchinnikov, Alexander Traugot, Valery Traugot, Vladimir Beskaravainy and Valentin Kurdov. The art of etching was enriched by the creations of Yuri Neprintsev, Valentina Petrova, Leonid Petrov, Alexander Kharshak, –ênatoli Smirnov, Vladimir Shistko and Vasily Zvontsov, while Vladimir Vetrogonsky, Victor Valtsefer, –ûleg Ivanov and Vadim Smirnov worked successfully in the field of lithography. In the decorative and applied art of Leningrad, too, in the 1960‚Äì1980s, as Natalia Taranovskaya puts it, \\"features of a single school were forming\\". In porcelain, ceramics and glass related concepts of the beauty of shapes and ideal proportions took hold. In this period significant works were produced by the porcelain artists Vladimir Gorodetsky, Nina Slavina, Alexei Vorobievsky and Anna Leporskaya, the ceramists Vladimir Vasilkovsky, Natalia Savinova, Alexander Zadorin, Inna Olevskaya and –úikhail Kopilkov, the glass artists Boris Smirnov, Leyda Yurgen, Alexandra Ostroumova, Helle Pild, Ekaterina Yanovskaya and Serafima Bogdanova and the fabric designers Sarah Buntsus, Nika Moiseeva, Inna Rakhimova, Rose Krestovskaya and Tatiana Prozorova. Alongside the acknowledged leaders of Leningrad's artistic industries ‚Äì the Leningrad Lomonosov Porcelain Factory, the Leningrad Artistic Glassworks, the Slutskaya Textile Mill and the Russkiye Samotsvety jewellery factory ‚Äì new manufacturing facilities appeared in which members of Leningrad's young generation of specialists in decorative and applied art realized their ambitious ideas.  Criticism and Legacy  In 1992, after the break-up of the USSR and Leningrad being renamed Saint Petersburg, the Saint Petersburg Artists‚Äô Union was formed, which became the legal successor to the Leningrad branch of the Artists‚Äô Union of the RSFSR. By that time funds were no longer being allocated for the official purchase of works of fine art. The Art Fund had also ceased to exist and its enterprises were liquidated or lost to the Artists‚Äô Union. The House of Creativity in Staraya Ladoga had also been lost. The artistic glassworks was closed down. There was a real threat of the single St Petersburg Artists‚Äô Union breaking apart and the historical building of the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts being lost. In this period Leningrad practitioners of the fine arts, using their authority and the support of colleagues and the public, were able to preserve the unity of the St Petersburg Artists‚Äô Union and the Academy of Arts as a school. Therein lies not only their great service to St Petersburg art but at the same time a symbolic handover from the Leningrad masters of the fine arts to new generations of St Petersburg artists. The contemporary development of the fine arts in Saint Petersburg demonstrates that in their wide variety of forms and manifestations they are guided by the finest traditions and achievements of Leningrad's exponents of painting, graphic art, monumental and applied art. Their works are to be found not only in the displays and stocks of major art museums and private collections. We encounter them on the pages of books and in a domestic setting. They adorn the squares, streets and public buildings of towns and cities. As a consequence this art not only continues to live an active life, but also inspires our contemporaries to draw upon and reinterpret its experience. This applies to such themes as the consequences of the formation in 1932 of a single LOSKh, Socialist Realism and the competition of directions and tendencies in the fine arts in Leningrad, the concept of a \\"Leningrad School\\" and more.Sergei V. Ivanov. The Leningrad School of Painting. Essays on the History. St Petersburg, ARKA Gallery Publishing, 2019. P.51. For example, regarding the formation of a single LOSKh, Valeria Ushakova writes: \\"We cannot deny that one of the main criteria for the assessment of works of art was professionalism. Paradoxical as it might be, it was precisely the struggle for so-called ‚Äòideological purity‚Äô that enabled Russian (Soviet) art to preserve its school... It was precisely the political choice in favour of realism that made it possible to preserve the traditions of true Russian realism and the splendid artistic school despite all the negative aspects of ideological pressure.\\"–£—à–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞, –í. –ê. –ü—Ä–æ—à–ª–æ–µ –∏ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–∏–µ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ ‚Äî –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –°–æ—é–∑ —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ // –•—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–∏ ‚Äî –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—É. –í—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞ –∫ 70-–ª–µ—Ç–∏—é –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –°–æ—é–∑–∞ —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. –°–ü–±: –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª—å, 2003. –°. 7.

Personal life Larrinaga was born in Sestao in the Basque Country in 1910, but at the age of seven he moved with his family to Basauri. In 1939 he settled in Mexico, where he married Yolanda Aspiazu Suarez with whom he adopted a son called Jos√© Manuel. Football career Larrinaga started his playing career at Basconia, where he played two seasons, before moving to Racing Santander for the inaugural season of La Liga in 1928. He usually played as a left midfielder. While at Racing the team's greatest success was coming runners up in the 1930/31 season in La Liga. With the out-break of the Spanish civil war in 1936 the national football leagues in Spain were put on hold. In the Basque Country a national team was selected to travel abroad to raise money to look after refugees fleeing the civil war and also to let the world know that there was a Basque government trying to resist the attack of the fascist rebels. Larrinaga was selected for this team. First they toured Europe, playing in France, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union, Norway and Denmark. They had great success but in the summer of 1937 the Basque Country was captured by the fascist army and so the team had to make a choice. Two players returned to Spain, but the rest decided to stick together and travel to Mexico to continue the tour there. Due to the ongoing civil war in Spain FIFA decided in 1938 to prohibit any FIFA affiliated teams from playing the Basque National team, insisting that the players could only continue to play together as a team if they joined a league. As they all still wanted to stay together the team became a club called Club Deportivo Euzkadi that participated in the Primera Fuerza league in Mexico during the 1938/39 season. At the end of that year the members of the team decided to go their separate ways, and so Larrinaga joined a Mexican side called Club Asturias along with two others from the Basque team. In 1942 he made his final move as a player when he joined another Mexican team called Club Espa√±a. Other work After retiring from football he worked for two companies called Homeop√°tica Intregral and Corvamex.

It aired on Fox in the United States on December 14, 2014. Plot Tina decides to quit her Thundergirls troop, Troop 119, after feeling that her troop does not care for her adherence to the older Thundergirl manual. However, her former troop leader, Ginny, recruits her to return to the troop as a spy. She needs Tina to help her figure out which girl in the troop is a mole for their rivals, Troop 257. Every year, Troop 119's Thundergirl cookie sales are terrible and Ginny has learned that it is due to someone giving Troop 257 all of their planned cookie sale locations ahead of time. She is certain now, because she told Troop 119 that her new workplace would be perfect, only to have Troop 257 appear and sell all her coworkers cookies before Troop 119 was able to arrive. Ginny spoke to all the girls in the troop‚ÄîKatie, Julie, Rena, Jodi, and Molly‚Äîand cannot determine which one is the mole; she knows it cannot be Tina, because Tina quit before the sabotage at her workplace happened. Tina agrees to help her. Louise learns about Tina's mission and tells Tina she will need her help if she wants to solve the case. When Tina refuses, Louise surprises her by joining Troop 119. Louise dubs her and Tina the \\"Mole Patrol\\". Tina's plan is to gain the mole's trust slowly and carefully, but Louise thinks a better idea would be to spread rumors to turn the girls against one another until the mole is revealed. Louise's plan sends the troop into chaos and when she threatens Jodi for a confession, Tina has enough and tells Louise that Mole Patrol is over and that she should leave the troop. Louise is angered and joins Troop 257 on her own under the name \\"Alanis\\" to determine who the mole is from the other end. She finds that Troop 257 is made up of extreme and hard edged girls who use a secret handshake involving farting noises when their finger is pulled. Meanwhile, in a subplot, Gretchen convinces Linda to dye her hair blonde. At first, Linda is enamored with her new look and aspires to play the \\"dumb, sexy blonde\\", but begins to fear that she truly is losing her intelligence because of her hair color. After seeing Gretchen dye her hair brunette, Linda changes her hair color back and feels secure that her intelligence has returned. Being no closer to solving the mystery, Tina loses hope and concludes that perhaps her adherence to the old manual indeed makes her too dated for the Thundergirls. However, looking into her old manual, she gets an idea. Meanwhile, Louise is forced to go with Troop 257 to sell cookies at their latest lead and sees that they have arrived at Bob's Burgers. Bob and Linda inadvertently reveal Louise's identity to Troop 257 just as Troop 119 enter, as summoned by Tina. Tina reveals that she used a Thundergirl survival trapping strategy of setting multiple traps for prey: she privately told each of the girls in her troop a different cookie lead location and waited to see which location Troop 257 went to, allowing her to know which girl was the mole based on the lead she gave her. She reveals that she gave Rena the restaurant location, and that Rena is the mole. Rena counters that the mole could be Tina since she also knew the location, but Louise pulls on Rena's finger and she reflexively makes the telltale Troop 257 farting noise handshake, confirming her as the mole. Rena coldly explains that she joined Troop 257 first and was selected after her first year to infiltrate their rival Troop 119 as a mole. She and Troop 257 then leave. Afterward, Tina states that she has decided to stay with Troop 119, and Louise is unimpressed, calling it a waste of time. Linda suggests that Louise only helped Tina and created the Mole Patrol because she wanted to spend time with her big sister and felt jealous that the Thundergirls monopolized her time. Louise reluctantly admits this to be the case. Tina invites her to join Troop 119, but Louise tells her she is not interested. Regardless, Tina gives her a friendship bracelet she made in Thundergirls and Louise quickly takes it and tells her that she will wear it forever. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, praising the character development for Tina from an initially weird and awkward teenager into a weird, but outgoing girl. However, Wilkins also noted that the episode specifically allowed more emotional insight into Louise as a character, stating, \\"Yes, this is a Thundergirl espionage story, but it‚Äôs also, as the once-again dark-haired Linda recognizes at episode‚Äôs end, a sweet little story about a little sister who is jealous of the organization that monopolizes so much of her big sister‚Äôs time. Throw in that bit of business about Linda going blonde and Troop 257 being the single most evil assortment of cookie sellers ever assembled, and you‚Äôve got a special episode on your hands.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10, calling it the least funny episode of the season. However, he noted that, \\"What tonight‚Äôs edition lost in spit-take inducing gags and one-liners, it made up for with a nicely silly plot, and an opportunity to see Tina doing something other than rhapsodizing about boys and horses.\\" The episode received a 1.3 rating and was watched by a total of 2.54 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Fox that night, behind Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Family Guy, and The Simpsons.

North Road Club Chase was a member of the North Road Club when he began riding in 1887. He won his first race 1893, taking first place 13 times out of 14 events he entered. By the end of 1894, he had set a number of time and distance records, and toured Europe, the U.S., and Australia. Champion cyclist Chase was a champion cyclist from 1896 to 1902. After retiring from the professional cycling scene, he teamed up with his brother F. W. Chase to build motorcycles. Many years after the motorcycle enterprise, he lodged a patent for an exhaust silencer. Cycling in 1898 was not without hazard, as Arthur found out to his detriment after a five-shilling fine. Not deterred by his run-in with the law, nine months later he was suspended for road racing. He seems to have kept his nose clean for another 4 years, until getting yet another fine at Doncaster Borough Court. Even years later when Arthur had moved to Southend, he was still newsworthy for being in court.

Pacing machine Chase had been using pacing tandems in the past, and even rode behind an electric pacing tandem when he went up against the famous French cyclist Bouhours in Paris in 1898. The use of a fast pacer was not considered cheating at that time, and this must have motivated Chase to have a special pacer custom-made to his design. He commissioned a UK firm to build the machine at the start of 1899, a tandem with a rear-mounted 1.75 hp deDion engine. Both riders pedalled, the front one being responsible for steering, the rear for control of the engine. This pacer was capable of 39 mph at top speed. Tandems Although Chase was a champion solo cyclist, he also tried his hand at tandem racing, along with Walters who would ride up front. Chase on a tandem Chase also worked with his brother in building Chase Brothers Motorcylces.

The lease included: ‚ÄúA forge or ironwork called Pilbeames Forge with buildings, cottages, coalhouses, coal-places, ground to lay sows of raw iron and all ponds, dikes, bays, floodgates, tools as shown in the schedule, access to the forge through the lands of John Pylcock and Richard Hart all in Chiddingstone and Withyham and two parcels of land on the south side of the forge in Withyham containing 6a. called Cleyes in the occupation of John Tantos; George Stace of Mereworth, yeoman, to Richard Streatfeild of Chiddingstone, yeoman, for a year at ¬£25.‚Äù Richard was certainly the one who established the strong economic foundation for the Streatfeild family. In his will he was still termed a yeoman, though by this time he had become a lord of a manor,A History of Chiddingstone by Gordon Ward and thus a gentleman, the manor of Cowden Leighton having been purchased in 1591 by himself and his father from a neighbouring noble family in decline, the Burgh family of Starborough Castle in Lingfield, Surrey. Further lands of the Burgh family were purchased in the same year and in 1596 the manors of Chiddingstone Cobham and Tyehurst were mortgaged by Thomas, Lord Burgh, to Richard Streatfeild's trustees. The mortgage was never repaid and the manors remained in the possession of members of the Streatfeild family.

Beep is also used in lieu of cash in some convenience stores and other businesses. The Beep system is implemented and operated by AF Payments Incorporated, which is primarily owned by Ayala Corporation and Metro Pacific Investments Corporation. Background A woman uses a Beep card to exit the loading/unloading area of a Line 3 station. The Beep payment system is implemented and operated by AF Payments Incorporated, which is a joint venture of Ayala Corporation and Metro Pacific Investments Corporation. The system makes use of a reloadable contactless smart card of the same name. Each card can store a value of up to . Beep cards can be used to travel through the Manila railway lines such as the Line 1, Line 2, and Line 3, select bus lines, and to pay for toll fees on the CAVITEX and NLEX roads. They can also be used as a mode of payment at FamilyMart stores through the tap-to-pay system. Aside from at FamilyMart outlets and MRT and LRT stations. Beep cards can be reloaded at Bayad Centers, SM Bills Payment Centers, Villarica Pawnshops, and Tambunting outlets, BPI Mobile app, and the Coins.ph app for NFC-enable devices. Some third-party loading partners are charging convenience fee ranging from ‚Ç±5.00 to ‚Ç±20.00 per transaction. The current price of beep card for first time users is ‚Ç±180.00 (‚Ç±80.00 for the card and ‚Ç±100.00 initial load). The maintaining balance is ‚Ç±65.00. History By August 5, 2015, all stations of Line 1 and Line 2 were already using beep cards. A unified ticketing system for all elevated rail lines in Metro Manila was completed when the beep card system became available to use in all stations of the Line 3 line in October 3, 2015. AF Payments and FamilyMart secured a partnership which allowed the reloading of beep cards in FamilyMart outlets starting December 7, 2016. It also allowed patrons of the convenient store to make purchases using the smart card. AF Payments also planned to secure similar deals with 7-Eleven and Ministop. In partnership with GCash, it became the first QR code transport ticketing system in the country on October 15, 2019 with BGC Bus and Cebu's Topline Express Ferries being the first to adopt the system for passengers‚Äô payment through the GCash mobile app. Reception AF Payments Inc. announced in March 2017 that it has sold 3 million beep cards, mostly to riders of LRT and MRT since it began the system's operations in 2015. It claimed that about 60 percent of MRT and LRT riders used Beep cards to pay their train travel expenses while the rest used the standard single- journey tickets. As of November 2018, more than five million cards have been sold and the company expects user growth at 1% to 2% annually. It was able to monitor one billion transactions on the year 2018, and plans to boost further by rolling out more payment services mostly in the transportation sector.  Plans  There are proposals to implement the system outside of Metro Manila and Cebu. The Southern Mindanao Bus Operators Association (SMBOA) is proposing the use of a Beep card at Davao City. SMBOA president Jerry Sy made the suggestion during their board meeting. He also urged them to introduce the technology to other bus companies. A private firm is eyeing to partner with jeepney cooperatives in Bukidnon province and the cities of Iloilo for their jeepneys in support of the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP) in the country. Peter Maher, president and chief executive officer of AF Payments Inc., said the initiative is part of the expansion outside Metro Manila. The company is also looking to integrate the beep card system with the under-construction MRT Line 7 and the Philippine National Railways (PNR) Bicol projects.  Issues  * Last October 1, 2020, the \\"No beep card, no ride\\" policy has been implemented in EDSA Busway to minimize physical contact between commuters and public transport personnel to reduce their risk of getting COVID-19 and to pave way for more seamless and faster transactions to trim down the queuing of passengers. The new policy has drawn flak from commuters due to the current price of the card and its immediate implementation. Within the first week of its implementation, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) suspend the mandatory use of beep cards after AF Payments Incorporated refused the government's request to waive the ‚Ç±80.00 costs of beep cards.

Broom married Jess Cooper in 1942, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. Early years Ivor Gordon Broom was born in Cardiff, Wales and educated at the Boy's County School, Pontypridd. At 17, Broom passed the Civil Service Exam and began work with the Inland Revenue. RAF career Broom learned to fly in 1940 while the Battle of Britain was being fought, and was posted to No. 114 Squadron in 1941. The squadron were flying Bristol Blenheim light bombers which were flown in low-level daylight operations against Channel and North Sea shipping as well as targets along the French, Dutch and German coasts. Broom took part in the successful raid against the Goldenburg- Werk lignite power stations, Knapsack, Germany in August 1941. In late 1941, while still a sergeant, Broom was detailed to lead a flight of six Blenheims to reinforce Singapore, en route the bombers landed on Malta which was under siege at the time by the Axis. When they landed on the island, Air Vice Marshal Hugh Pughe Lloyd commandeered Broom and his aircraft to replace the islands losses, the other five Blenheims flying on to Singapore. Broom joined No. 107 Squadron whose Blenheims were incurring heavy losses while attacking Axis shipping between Italy and North Africa as well as land targets in Italy and North Africa. When No. 107 Squadron had lost all its officers, Lloyd told Broom \\"Move into the officers' mess. We will sort the paperwork out later\\". Broom was promoted to Pilot officer. On 17 November 1941 he bombed and set on fire a 4,000 ton ship in the Gulf of Sirte (most likely the Priaruggia). After flying 43 sorties he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) and returned to Britain in January 1942. Broom undertook an instructors course at the Central Flying School and then spent a year training new Blenheim pilots how to perform low level attacks as an instructor in No. 13 OTU. In May 1943 Broom joined No. 1655 MTU as an instructor. In May 1944, Broom joined No. 571 Squadron flying the De Havilland Mosquito XVI as part of the Light Night Striking Force (LNSF) where he teamed up with his navigator Flight lieutenant Tommy Broom. They were known as \\"The Flying Brooms\\" and had a pair of crossed broomsticks painted on the nose of their aircraft. They remained friends until Ivor's death in 2003. The Mosquito was modified to carry a 4,000lb bomb known as \\"cookies\\" and carried no defensive armament. They made numerous raids over Berlin. In September 1944 Broom was appointed Flight Commander in No. 128 Squadron, still part of the LNSF. In January 1945 Broom was appointed as Commanding Officer of No. 163 Squadron. His navigator Tommy Broom joined him as the squadron's navigation leader. They remained together until the end of the war. For leading raids on Berlin, Ivor was awarded a Distinguished Service Order and Tommy a DFC. After the war ended, Broom dropped rank to squadron leader to command No. 28 Squadron flying Spitfires in Singapore. In 1948 he returned home and dropped rank again, to flight lieutenant, to attend staff college. After passing out he resumed his career as a Squadron Leader and learnt to fly jets. In 1953 he became Commanding Officer of No. 57 Squadron which had been equipped with English Electric Canberra jet bombers. He flew a specially modified Canberra from Ottawa to London via the North Pole, Broom was awarded the Air Force Cross. In 1956 Broom became responsible for the Bomber Command Development Unit at Wittering. In 1959 he moved into the Air Secretary's department followed by, in 1962 becoming station commander at RAF Bruggen in Germany. Subsequently, he became in 1964 a staff officer at the Air Ministry and in 1966 was appointed Director of Organisation (Establishments). In 1968 Broom became Commandant of Central Flying School.

Location  Alst is located in the district of Steinfurt, which is part of the region of M√ºnster, near Horstmar. The distance to the northern district town Steinfurt is about eight kilometers, M√ºnster in the south-east direction is about 30 kilometers away. The Dutch border with Gronau in northwest is also about 30 km away.  History  Already in 1155 AD the hamlet Alst is mentioned. Its name might be based on alahstedi (Old German for sanctuary site) and Alstet (about 1319). The name 'Alst (Alahstedi)' indicates an early Germanic place of sacrifice. This was probably at the site of the present 'Alster Kreuz' (Alst Cross), where a few years ago the remains of a Christ Corpus of early Christian times were found between ancient oak roots. But the story goes far back in time, of which no written records exist. The local historian Heinrich B√∂rsting says: 'There is no doubt that the existence of Alst Castle 'Haus Alst' starts in the Saxon period and is far older than any other castles of Horstmar and Schagern.'. Many historians conclude this advanced age from the name 'Alst'. The inhabitants of Alst were very early called half citizens of Horstmar. Most likely this is due to the fact that the lords of Haus Alst were Burgmanns of Horstmar at the same time and were therefore obliged by the bishop to perform military service and to defend the castle of Horstmar. As sojourners they paid half taxes and citizens were obliged to guard and other services.Festschrift Sch√ºtzenvereines Alst e.V. 300 Jahre (a local memorial publication)  Flag  The Flag of Alst is horizontally striped in the colors green and white.  Culture and sights   Haus Alst  Haus Alst, first officially mentioned in 1217 AD, is a former house of a Burgmann and has been residence of the family Schorlemer-Alst. It was built on the site of an older castle and built in the Renaissance style.  Friedenskapelle Alst  Friedenskapelle Alst (peace chapel of Alst) Information text, available in the chapel: The desire for peace, born of the horrors of two world wars, was the motive for the construction of this chapel. In many hours of self-performance the 260 residents of the hamlet Alst and some friends created the monument, which was inaugurated in 1967. 1988 donated the spouses Erich and Gabriele B√ºttner the crucifix in the middle of the front wall. The Cross is assisted by a statue of the Madonna‚Äîthe Queen of Peace. The group of figures in between should tell us: 'Join hands to peace'. A stele on the left wall, built in 1985, depicts the Annunciation and the Nativity.Parts of an information text, available in the chapel  Sch√ºtzenverein Alst e.V.  The first known documents about the Sch√ºtzenverein Alst are from 1705 AD, after historians first assumed 1880 and 1830 as year of establishment. The first statutes of the association have been recorded on 11 February 1880 in five points. On November 1, 1983, four members of the Sch√ºtzenverein created statues for registration at the District Court. The statues were ratified on November 12, 1983, on the Annual General Meeting of the association.
