It was originally established by the 1st Cavalry Division during Operation Pegasus, the relief of Khe Sanh. Companies A and B, 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment and Company A, 1st Battalion, 77th Artillery Regiment were located at the base in early May 1968. On 4 May the base came under 120mm mortar and 122mm rocket fire. At approximately 16:30 3 122mm rockets impacted among approximately 2000 rounds of 105m ammunition that had been delivered just prior to the attack. The resultant fire and explosions, coupled with a direct hit on a 105mm gun section rendered 1 gun inoperational while the other two guns continued to function despite ammunition Cooking off. In the early morning of 5 May 1968 the base again received incoming 120mm mortar rounds and B-40 rockets followed by a sapper attack. The attack was repelled with thirty-two People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) soldiers killed inside the defensive wire. Due to its losses in both equipment and personnel, later on 5 May Company A 1/77th was extracted and repositioned at LZ Jane. Eleven US soldiers were killed in the 5 May attack.

The house is considered by many to be a local icon and is the subject of a grassroots campaign to buy back the property from the refuge to preserve the house. Origin Legend The house's notoriety is in part due to a popular local urban legend about its creation. The story suggests the house's location was a result of a divorce in which the wife demanded an exact replica of their Newburyport house, but failed to specify the location, resulting in the spiteful husband building it on the edge of town, in the Great Marsh with saltwater plumbing. For this reason, the building is often listed as an example of a spite house. Preservation Movement In 2015, amid community concerns the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge would demolish the property, a group founded by local residents was formed to advocate for the preservation of the house. The refuge, which had originally planned on using the property for school field trip bus parking, agreed to postpone demolition to explore alternatives. In 2018, refuge staff met with members of Essex County Greenbelt, a conservation organization, to discuss the option of a land transfer.

The second stage‚Äîwhich is also referred to as \\"Starship\\"‚Äîis being designed as a long-duration cargo, and eventually, passenger-carrying spacecraft. It is being used initially without any booster stage at all, as part of an extensive development program to prove out launch- and-landing and iterate on a variety of design details, particularly with respect to the vehicle's atmospheric reentry. While the spacecraft is currently being tested on its own at suborbital altitudes during 2019‚Äì20, it will later be used on orbital launches with an additional booster stage, the Super Heavy, where the spacecraft will serve as both the second stage on the two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle and the in-space long-duration orbital spaceship. Integrated system testing of a proof of concept for Starship began in March 2019, with the addition of a single Raptor rocket engine to a reduced-height prototype, nicknamed Starhopper ‚Äì similar to Grasshopper, an equivalent prototype of the Falcon 9 reusable booster. Starhopper was used from April through August 2019 for static testing and low-altitude, low- velocity flight testing of vertical launches and landings in July and August 2019. More prototype Starships have been built and more are under construction as the iterative design goes through several iterations. All test articles have a -diameter stainless steel hull. SpaceX could potentially launch commercial payloads using Starship no earlier than 2021. In April 2020, NASA selected a modified human-rated Starship system as one of three potential lunar landing system design concepts to receive funding for a 10-month long initial design phase for the NASA Artemis program.  Nomenclature  While the name of the vehicle has changed many times over the years, the combination of Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy booster is called the \\"Starship system\\" by SpaceX in their payload users guide. Sometimes, as on the SpaceX website, the term \\"Starship\\" is used as a collective term for both the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy booster. At least as early as 2005, SpaceX used the codename, \\"BFR\\", for a conceptual heavy-lift vehicle, \\"far larger than the Falcon family of vehicles\\",https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2005/11/spacex-set- maiden-flight-goals/ SPACEX set maiden flight ‚Äì goals] , NASASpaceFlight.com, 18 November 2005, accessed 31 January 2019. with a goal of to orbit. Beginning in mid-2013, SpaceX referred to both the mission architecture and the vehicle as the Mars Colonial Transporter. By the time a large 12-meter diameter design concept was unveiled in September 2016, SpaceX had begun referring to the overall system as the Interplanetary Transport System. With the announcement of a new 9-meter design in September 2017, SpaceX resumed referring to the vehicle as \\"BFR\\". Musk said in the announcement, \\"we are searching for the right name, but the code name, at least, is BFR\\". SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell subsequently stated that BFR stands for, \\"Big Falcon Rocket\\". However, Elon Musk had explained in the past that although BFR is the official name, he drew inspiration from the BFG weapon in the Doom video games. The BFR had also occasionally been referred to informally by the media and internally at SpaceX as \\"Big Fucking Rocket\\". At the time, the second stage/spacecraft was referred to as \\"BFS\\".Space tourists will have to wait as SpaceX plans bigger rocket . Stu Clark, The Guardian. 8 February 2018.SpaceX signs its first passenger to fly aboard the Big Falcon Rocket Moon mission . CatchNews. 14 September 2018. The booster first stage was also at times referred to as the \\"BFB\\". In November 2018, the spaceship was renamed Starship, and the first stage booster was named Super Heavy. Notably, in the fashion of SpaceX, even that term \\"Super Heavy\\" had been previously used by SpaceX in a different context. In February 2018, at about the time of the first Falcon Heavy launch, Musk had \\"suggested the possibility of a Falcon Super Heavy ‚Äì a Falcon Heavy with extra boosters. 'We could really dial it up to as much performance as anyone could ever want. If we wanted to we could actually add two more side boosters and make it Falcon Super Heavy'\\".  History  The launch vehicle was initially mentioned in public discussions by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk in 2012 as part of a description of the company's overall Mars system architecture, then known as \\"Mars Colonial Transporter\\" (MCT). By August 2014, media sources speculated that the initial flight test of the Raptor-driven super-heavy launch vehicle could occur as early as 2020, in order to fully test the engines under orbital spaceflight conditions; however, any colonization effort was then reported to continue to be \\"deep into the future\\". In mid-September 2016, Musk noted that the Mars Colonial Transporter name would not continue, as the system would be able to \\"go well beyond Mars\\", and that a new name would be needed. The name selected was \\"Interplanetary Transport System\\" (ITS), although in an AMA on Reddit on 23 October 2016, Musk stated, \\"I think we need a new name. ITS just isn't working. I'm using BFR and BFS for the rocket and spaceship, which is fine internally, but...\\", without stating what the new name might be. In September 2017, at the 68th annual meeting of the International Astronautical Congress, SpaceX unveiled an updated vehicle design. Musk said, \\"we are searching for the right name, but the code name, at least, is BFR\\". In a September 2018 announcement of a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private spaceflight called dearMoon project, Musk showed another redesigned concept for the second stage and spaceship with three rear fins and two front canard fins added for atmospheric entry, replacing the previous delta wing and split flaps shown a year earlier. The design was to use seven identically-sized Raptor engines in the second stage; the same engine model as would be used on the first stage. The second stage design had two small actuating canard fins near the nose of the ship, and three large fins at the base, two of which would actuate, with all three serving as landing legs. Additionally, SpaceX also stated in the second half of the month that they were \\"no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability\\". The two major parts of the launch vehicle were given descriptive names in November 2018: \\"Starship\\" for the upper stage and \\"Super Heavy\\" for the booster stage, which Musk pointed out was \\"needed to escape Earth's deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)\\". In January 2019, Elon Musk announced that the Starship would no longer be constructed out of carbon fiber, and that stainless steel would be used instead to build the Starship. Musk cited several reasons including cost, strength, and ease of production to justify making the switch. In May 2019, the Starship design changed back to just six Raptor engines, with three optimized for sea-level and three optimized for vacuum. By late May 2019, an initial prototype, Starhopper, was being finished for untethered flight tests at the SpaceX South Texas launch site, while two \\"orbital prototypes\\" were under construction, one in South Texas begun in March 2019 and one on the Florida space coast begun before May 2019. The build of the first Super Heavy booster stage was projected to be able to start by September 2019. At the time, neither of the two orbital prototypes yet had aerodynamic control surfaces nor landing legs added to the under construction tank structures, and Musk indicated that the design for both would be changing once again. In September 2019, the externally-visible \\"moving fins\\" began to be added to the Mk1 prototype, giving a view into the promised mid-2019 redesign of the aerodynamic control surfaces for the test vehicles. In June 2019, SpaceX publicly announced discussions had begun with three telecommunications companies for using Starship, rather than Falcon 9, for launching commercial satellites for paying customers in 2021. No specific companies or launch contracts were announced at that time. In July 2019, the Starhopper made its initial flight test, a \\"hop\\" of around altitude, and a second and final \\"hop\\" in August 2019, reached an altitude of ~ and landing around from the launchpad. SpaceX completed most of the Boca Chica prototype, the Starship Mk1, in time for Musk's next public update in September 2019. Watching the construction in progress before the event, observers online circulated photos and speculated about the most visible change, a move to two tail fins from the earlier three. During the event, Musk added that landing would now be accomplished on six dedicated landing legs, following a re-entry protected by glass heat tiles. Updated specifications were provided: when optimized, Starship was expected to mass at empty and be able to initially transport a payload of with an objective of growing that to over time. Musk suggested that an orbital flight might be achieved by the fourth or fifth test prototype in 2020, using a Super Heavy booster in a two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle configuration, and emphasis was placed on possible future lunar missions. In September 2019, Elon Musk unveiled Starship Mk1. At the time, construction of Mk3 was expected to start in about a month. In 2019, the cost per launch for Starship was estimated by SpaceX to be as low as US$2 million once the company achieves a robust operational cadence and achieves the technological advance of full and rapid reusability. Full reusability of the second stage of Starship is a fundamental design goal for the entire Starship development program, but success is uncertain. Elon Musk has said in 2020 that, with a high flight rate, they could potentially go even lower, with a fully-burdened marginal cost on the order of US$10 per kilogram of payload launched to low Earth orbit. In November 2019, the Mk1 test article in Texas came apart in a tank pressure test, and SpaceX stated they would cease to build the Mk2 prototype under construction in Florida and move on to work on the Mk3 article. A few weeks later, the work on the vehicles in Florida slowed down substantially, with some assemblies that had been built in Florida for those vehicles being transported to the Texas Starship assembly location, and a reported 80% reduction in the workforce at the Florida assembly location as SpaceX pauses activities there. Apparently, at the same time the Mk4 vehicle under construction in Florida was cancelled. Adopting a new \\"serial number\\" nomenclature, the Mk3 article was renamed Starship SN1 by SpaceX to signify the major evolution in building techniques: the rings were now taller and each was made of one single sheet of steel, drastically reducing the welding lines (thus failure points). Also the worksite was expanded with more tents, structures and upgraded machinery to give the workers a much better controlled environment, allowing for better precision work and, more importantly, better quality welds. Smaller articles were made and tested to destruction to validate the new bulkheads design. This was a significant change of pace for SpaceX's approach. In February 2020, SN1 too was destroyed when undergoing pressurization. The company then focused on resolving the problem that led to SN1's failure by assembling a stripped down version of their next planned prototype, SN2. This time the test was successful and SpaceX began work on SN3. However, in April 2020, SN3 was also destroyed during testing due to a test configuration error. At that time, construction of SN4 was underway. On 26 April 2020, Starship SN4 became the first full-scale prototype to pass a cryogenic proof test, in which the ship's liquid oxygen and methane was replaced with similarly frigid but non-explosive liquid nitrogen. SN4 was only pressurized to 4.9 bar (~70 psi), which is more than enough to perform a small flight test. On 5 May 2020, SN4 completed a single engine static fire with one mounted Raptor engine and became the first full Starship tank to pass a Raptor static fire. SN4 would complete a total of 4 short static fires (2 to 5 seconds long) before being destroyed in a massive explosion due to a propellant leak from the quick disconnect mechanism occurring at the end of a test fire on 29 May 2020. SN7 test tank was also tested all the way to leak at around 7.8 bar after which it was repaired and tested to destruction. On 30 July 2020, Starship SN5 completed a static fire with one mounted Raptor engine. On 3 August 2020, Starship SN5 attempted a 150 meter flight test that was aborted due to a spin start valve on the Raptor engine not opening. At approximately 11:00 AM CDT on 4 August 2020, SpaceX again attempted a 150 meter flight test, which was also aborted. Later that day, at approximately 7:00 PM CDT, Starship SN5 completed the 150 meter flight test, landing at an adjacent landing site, thus becoming the first full-scale prototype to perform a successful flight test. After the flight, Elon Musk stated in August that SpaceX would carry out several additional short flights in order to refine the launch process, before attempting a high altitude flight using a vehicle with body flaps. Starship SN6 completed construction, and was moved to the test stand; static fire testing was to start on 23 August 2020, after 3 attempts on 23 August 2020 they finally had a successful static fire at about 7:43 PM CDT. After unsuccessful hop attempts on 30 August 2020, SN6 completed a maiden 150 meter flight test on 3 September at about 12.45 PM CDT. Currently, other prototypes are under construction for pressure testing (Starship SN7.1), and flight test articles (Starship SN8 and SN9, the first to have nosecones and aero surfaces). While the Starship program had a small development team for several years, and a larger development and build team since late 2018, Musk declared in June 2020 that Starship is the top SpaceX priority, except for anything related to reduction of Crew Dragon return risk for the NASA Demo-2 flight to the ISS, and remained so in September 2020. While Mars has always been a critically important driver of requirements for the Starship system, and Musk had earlier hoped to have an initial orbital test flight by 2020, Musk toned down the expectations when he spoke to the Humans to Mars conference in August 2020. He said that \\"the first Starship launches to orbit 'might not work,' saying that SpaceX is in 'uncharted territory. ...Nobody has ever made a fully reusable, orbital rocket'\\". Musk clarified that SpaceX intends to fly exclusively cargo transport missions initially, and that passenger flights would come only much later. Starship will fly \\"hundreds of missions with satellites before we put people on board.\\"  Description  Comparison = Super Heavy = Super Heavy, the booster stage \\"needed to escape Earth's deep gravity well\\", is expected to be long and in diameter with a gross liftoff mass of . It is to be constructed of stainless steel tanks and structure, holding subcooled liquid methane and liquid oxygen (/LOX) propellants, powered by ~28 Raptor rocket engines that will provide total liftoff thrust. The specification propellant capacity of Super Heavy was shown as in May 2020, 3% more than estimated in September 2019. The initial prototype Super Heavy will be full size. It is expected however, to initially fly with less than the full complement of 28 engines, perhaps approximately 20. The Super Heavy external design changed throughout 2019/20 as the detailed design was iterated and the Raptor engines were tested and achieved higher power levels. In September 2019, a design change for the booster stage to have six fins that serve exclusively as fairings to cover the six landing legs, and four diamond-shaped welded steel grid fins to provide aerodynamic control on descent, was discussed. In August 2020, as the first build of \\"booster prototype 1\\" was to get underway, Musk noted that the leg design had been modified to just four landing legs and fins, to improve supersonic engine plume re-circulation margins.  Landing  In September 2016, Elon Musk described the possibility of landing the ITS booster on the launch pad. He re- described this in September 2017 with the Big Falcon Booster (BFB). In 2019, Musk announced that it will initially have landing legs to support the early VTVL development testing of Super Heavy. = Starship upper stage = Artist's concept of Starship upper stage following stage separation , the Starship upper stage is expected to be a , , fully reusable spacecraft with a dry mass of or less, powered by six methane/oxygen-propellant Raptor engines, three of them will be for use at sea-level while the other three would be used for Vacuum burns. Total Starship thrust will be approximately . Unusual for previous launch vehicle and spacecraft designs, the upper stage of Starship is intended to function both as a second stage to reach orbital velocity on launches from Earth, and also be used in outer space as an on-orbit long- duration spacecraft. Starship is being designed so as to be capable of reentering Earth's atmosphere from orbital velocities and landing vertically, with a design goal of rapid re-usability. Starship will use three sea-level optimized Raptor engines and three vacuum-optimized Raptor engines. These sea- level engines are identical to the engines on the Super Heavy booster. Transport use in space is expected to use a vacuum-optimized Raptor engine variant to optimize specific impulse (Isp) to approximately . Starship is planned to eventually be built in at least these operational variants: * Spaceship: a large, long-duration spacecraft capable of carrying passengers or cargo to interplanetary destinations, to LEO, or Earth-to-Earth spaceflight. * Satellite delivery spacecraft: a vehicle able to transport and place spacecraft into orbit, or handle the in-space recovery of spacecraft and space debris for return to Earth or movement to another orbit. In the March 2020 users guide, this was shown with a large cargo bay door that can open in space to facilitate delivery and pickup of cargo. * Tanker: a cargo-only propellant tanker to support the refilling of propellants in Earth orbit. The tanker will enable launching a heavy spacecraft to interplanetary space as the spacecraft being refueled can use its tanks twice, first to reach LEO and afterwards to leave Earth orbit. The tanker variant, also required for high-payload lunar flights, is expected to come only later; initial in-space propellant transfer will be from one standard Starship to another.\\"Orbital refilling is critical for high payload to moon or Mars. Initially just Starship to Starship, later dedicated tankers.\\" , Elon Musk, Twitter, 21 July 2019, accessed 22 July 2019. * Lunar-surface-to-orbit transport: a variant of Starship without airbrakes or heat shielding that is required for in-atmosphere-operations. Additionally the ship will be equipped with a docking port on the nose and have white paint (as opposed to the bare steel planned for regular Starships). On 30 April 2020, NASA selected SpaceX to develop a human-rated lunar lander for the Artemis program, therefore requiring SpaceX to develop an approach for a direct lunar landing.  Characteristics of Starship  Characteristics of Starship are to include: * Ability to re-enter Earth's atmosphere and retropropulsively land on a designated landing pad, landing reliability is projected by SpaceX to ultimately be able to achieve \\"airline levels\\" of safety due to engine-out capability * Rapid reusability without the need for extensive refurbishment * Automated rendezvous and docking operations * On-orbit propellant transfers between Starships * Ability to reach the Moon and Mars after on-orbit propellant loading * Stainless steel structure and tank construction. Its strength-to-mass ratio should be comparable to or better than the earlier SpaceX design alternative of carbon fiber composites across the anticipated temperature ranges, from the low temperatures of cryogenic propellants to the high temperatures of atmospheric reentry * Some parts of the craft will be built with a stainless steel alloy that \\"has undergone [a type of] cryogenic treatment, in which metals are ... cold-formed/worked [to produce a] cryo- treated steel ... dramatically lighter and more wear-resistant than traditional hot-rolled steel.\\" * Methox (methane gas/oxygen gas)A conversation with Elon Musk about Starship , Tim Dodd, 1 October 2019, accessed 12 June 2020. pressure fed hot gas reaction control system (RCS) thrusters for attitude control, including the final pre-landing pitch-up maneuver from belly flop to tail down, and stability during high-wind landings up to .https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1015648140341403648 , Elon Musk, 18 July 2018, accessed 12 June 2020.

Kristin Houser, Futurism. 22 January 2019.) Options under study included hexagonal ceramic tiles that could be used on the windward side of Starship. * A novel atmospheric re-entry approach for planets with atmospheres. While retropropulsion is intended to be used for the final landing maneuver on the Earth, Moon, or Mars, 99.9% of the energy dissipation on Earth reentry is to be removed aerodynamically, and on Mars, 99% aerodynamically even using the much thinner Martian atmosphere, where \\"body flaps\\" are used to control attitude during descent and optimize both trajectory and energy dissipation during descent. * As envisioned in the 2017 design unveiling, the Starship is to have a pressurized volume of approximately , which could be configured for up to 40 cabins, large common areas, central storage, a galley, and a solar flare shelter for Mars missions. * Flexible design options; for example, a possible design modification to the base Starship ‚Äì expendable three-engine Starship with no fairing, rear fins, nor landing legs in order to optimize its mass ratio for interplanetary exploration with robotic probes. According to Musk, when Starship is used for beyond Earth orbit (BEO) launches to Mars, the functioning of the overall expedition system will necessarily include propellant production on the Mars surface. He says that this is necessary for the return trip and to reuse the spaceship to keep costs as low as possible. He also says that lunar destinations (circumlunar flybys, orbits and landings) will be possible without lunar-propellant depots, so long as the spaceship is refueled in a high-elliptical orbit before the lunar transit begins. Some lunar flybys will be possible without orbital refueling as evidenced by the mission profile of the dearMoon project. The SpaceX approach is to tackle the hardest problems first, and Musk sees the hardest problem for getting to sustainable human civilization on Mars to be building a fully-reusable orbital Starship, so that is the major focus of SpaceX resources as of 2020. For example, it is planned for the spacecraft to eventually incorporate life support systems, but , Musk has stated that it is yet to be developed, as the early flights will all be cargo only.Elon Musk wants to move fast with SpaceX‚Äôs Starship .

Joel Hruska, Extreme Tech. 30 September 2019. = Starship Human Landing System = A modified version known as the Starship Human Landing System (Starship HLS) was selected by NASA in April 2020 for potential use for long- duration crewed lunar landings as part of NASA's Artemis program. The Starship HLS variant is being designed to stay on and around the Moon and as such both the heat shield and air-brakes ‚Äì integral parts of the main Starship design ‚Äì are not included in the Starship HLS design. The variant will use high-thrust methox RCS thrusters located mid-body on Starship HLS during the final \\"tens of meters\\" of the terminal lunar descent and landing, and will also include a smaller crew area and a much larger cargo bay, be powered by a solar array located on its nose below the docking port. SpaceX intends to use the same high-thrust RCS thrusters for liftoff from the lunar surface. If built, the HLS variant would be launched to Earth orbit via the Super Heavy booster and would use orbital refueling to reload propellants into Starship HLS for the lunar transit and lunar landing operations. In the 2020 mission concept, a NASA Orion spacecraft would carry a NASA crew to the lander where they would depart and descend to the surface in Starship HLS. After Lunar surface operations, it would ascend using the same Starship HLS vehicle and return the crew to the Orion. Although not confirmed yet, the vehicle in theory could be refueled in orbit to carry more crews and cargo to the surface. SpaceX is one of three organizations developing their lunar lander designs for the Artemis program over a 10-month period in 2020-2021. If SpaceX completes the milestone-based requirements of the design contract, then NASA will pay SpaceX US$135 million in design development funding. The other teams selected are the 'National Team' ‚Äì led by Blue Origin but including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Draper ‚Äì with US$579 million in design funding and Dynetics ‚Äì with SNC and other unspecified companies ‚Äì with US$253 million in NASA funding. At the end of the ten-month program, NASA will evaluate which contractors will be offered contracts for initial demonstration missions and select firms for development and maturation of lunar lander systems.

The low-altitude, low-velocity Starhopper was used for initial integrated testing of the Raptor rocket engine with a flight- capable propellant structure, and was slated to also test the newly designed autogenous pressurization system that is replacing traditional helium tank pressurization as well as initial launch and landing algorithms for the much larger rocket. SpaceX originally developed their reusable booster technology for the 3-meter-diameter Falcon 9 from 2012 to 2018. The Starhopper prototype was also the platform for the first flight tests of the full-flow staged combustion methalox Raptor engine, where the hopper vehicle was flight tested with a single engine in July/August 2019, but could be fitted with up to three engines to facilitate engine-out tolerance testing. The high-altitude, high- velocity 'Starship orbital prototypes' (everything after Starhopper) are planned to be used to develop and flight test thermal protection systems and hypersonic reentry control surfaces. Each orbital prototype is expected to be outfitted with more than three Raptor engines. = Starhopper = Picture of Starhopper before flight The construction of the initial test article ‚Äì the Starship HopperCommercial Space Transportation Experimental Permit -- Experimental Permit Number: EP19-012, FAA, 21 June 2019, accessed 29 June 2019. or Starhopper ‚Äì was begun in early December 2018 and the external frame and skin was complete by 10 January 2019. Constructed outside in the open on a SpaceX property just from Boca Chica Beach in South Texas, the external body of the rocket rapidly came together in less than six weeks from half-inch (12.5 mm) steel. Originally thought by onlookers at the SpaceX South Texas Launch Site to be the initial construction of a large water tower, the stainless steel vehicle was built by welders and construction workers in more of a shipyard form of construction than traditional aerospace manufacturing. The full Starhopper vehicle is in diameter and was originally tall in January 2019. Subsequent wind damage to the nose cone of the vehicle resulted in a SpaceX decision to scrap the nose section, and fly the low-velocity hopper tests with no nose cone, resulting in a much shorter test vehicle. From mid- January to early-March 2019, a major focus of the manufacture of the test article was to complete the pressure vessel construction for the liquid methane and liquid oxygen tanks, including plumbing up the system, and moving the lower tank section of the vehicle to the launch pad on 8 March 2019. Integrated system testing of the Starhopper ‚Äì with the newly built ground support equipment (GSE) at the SpaceX South Texas facilities ‚Äì began in March 2019. \\"These tests involved fueling Starhopper with LOX and liquid methane and testing the pressurization systems, observed via icing of propellant lines leading to the vehicle and the venting of cryogenic boil off at the launch/test site. During a period of over a week, StarHopper underwent almost daily tanking tests, wet dress rehearsals and a few pre-burner tests.\\" Following initial integrated system testing of the Starhopper test vehicle with Raptor engine serial number 2 (Raptor SN2) in early April, the engine was removed for post-test analysis and several additions were made to the Starhopper. Attitude control system thrusters were added to the vehicle, along with shock absorbers for the non-retractable landing legs, and quick- disconnect connections for umbilicals. Raptor SN4 was installed in early June for fit checks, but the first test flight that is not tethered was expected to fly with Raptor SN5, until it suffered damage during testing at SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility, in McGregor, Texas. Subsequently, Raptor SN6 was the engine used by Starhopper for its untethered flights. = Low-altitude prototypes = By December 2018, initial construction of two low-altitude prototype ships had begun, referred to as Mk1 at Boca Chica, Texas, and Mk2 at the space coast of Florida in Cocoa. Planned for high-altitude and high- velocity testing, the prototypes were described to be taller than the Starhopper, have thicker skins, and a smoothly curving nose section. Both prototypes measured in diameter by approximately in height.'Totally Nuts'? Elon Musk Aims to Put a Starship in Orbit in 6 Months. Here's SpaceX's Plan. Mike Wall, Space.com. 30 September 2019. On 20 November 2019, the Starship Mk1 was partially destroyed during max pressure tank testing, when the forward LOX tank ruptured along a weld line of the craft's steel structure, propelling the bulkhead several meters upwards. The upper bulkhead went airborne and landed some distance away from the craft. No injuries were reported. In a statement concerning the test anomaly, SpaceX said they will retire the Mk1 and Mk2 prototypes after the incident, and focus on Mk3 and Mk4 designs, which are closer to the flight specifications. Construction had begun on the Mk2 Starship in Florida by mid-October 2019,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/17/spacex-starts-construction-of-another- starship-rocket-in-florida.html , CNBC, 17 October 2019, accessed 18 October 2019. but work then ceased in Florida (with apparent cancellation of Mk2https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/12/05/spacex-pausing-some-starship-work-in- florida/ , Spaceflightnow.com, 25 December 2019, accessed 27 June 2020.) and focused on the Texas site. The prototype in Texas (Mk3) was renamed to SN1 (serial number 1). It was destroyed during a pressure test on 28 February 2020. After this incident, SpaceX announced they would focus on the next prototype, the Starship SN2. SN2 successfully went through a pressure and cryo test, but was not used for a static fire or hop. Instead, SpaceX moved on to SN3, the next prototype. SN3's cryo test then failed, the result being the LOX (Liquid Oxygen) Tank collapsing due to underpressurisation. On 26 April 2020, SN4 successfully completed a cryogenic pressure test. On 20 May 2020, SN4 exploded after a successful engine test when SpaceX tested a new \\"quick disconnect\\" design as part of ground support equipment testing. On 4 August, SN5 completed a 150 m hop, its first successful launch and landing. = Testing = SN5 prototype being moved by a crane onto a stand before test flight. The Starhopper was used to flight test a number of subsystems of the Starship and to begin to expand the flight envelope as the Starship design is iterated. Initial tests began in March 2019. All test flights of the Starhopper were at low altitude. On 3 April 2019, SpaceX conducted a successful static fire test in Texas of its Starhopper vehicle, which ignited the engine while the vehicle remained tethered to the ground. The first static fire test of the Starhopper, with a single Raptor engine attached, occurred on 3 April 2019. The firing was a few seconds in duration, and was classed as successful by SpaceX. A second tethered test followed just two days later, on 5 April 2019. By May 2019, SpaceX was planning to conduct flight tests both in South Texas and on the Florida space coast. The FAA issued a one-year experimental permit in June 2019 to fly Starhopper at Boca Chica, including pre-flight and post-flight ground operations. The maiden flight test of the Starhopper test vehicle, and also the maiden flight test of any full-flow staged combustion rocket engine ever, was on 25 July 2019, and attained a height of . This was not a full-duration burn but a 22-second test, and it accidentally set fire to nearby vegetation. SpaceX is developing their next- generation rocket to be reusable from the beginning, just like an aircraft, and thus needs to start with narrow flight test objectives, while still aiming to land the rocket successfully to be used subsequently in further tests to expand the flight envelope. The second and final untethered test flight of the Starhopper test article was carried out on 27 August 2019, to a VTVL altitude of . On 4 August 2020, prototype SN5 with full-height propellant tanks and a single Raptor engine, conducted a test flight to a height of about , descending to a nearby landing pad.  Intended uses  Starship is intended to become the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle, as SpaceX has announced it intends to eventually replace its existing Falcon 9 launch vehicle and SpaceX Dragon 2 fleet with Starship, which is expected to take cargo to orbit at far lower cost than any other existing launch vehicle, whether from SpaceX or other launch service provider. In November 2019, Elon Musk estimated that fuel will cost US$900,000 per launch and total launch costs could drop as low as US$2 million. Starship is an architecture designed to do many diverse spaceflight missions, principally due to the very low marginal cost per mission that the fully-reusable spaceflight vehicles bring to spaceflight technology that were absent in the first six decades after humans put technology into space. Specifically, Starship is designed to be used for: * Earth-orbit satellite delivery market. In addition to the standard external launch market that SpaceX has been servicing since 2013, the company intends to use Starship to launch the largest portion of its own internet satellite constellation, Starlink, with more than 12,000 satellites intended to be launched by 2026, more than six times the total number of active satellites on orbit in 2018. An orbital launch of Starship could place ~400 Starlink satellites into orbit with a single launch, whereas the Falcon 9 flights in 2019-20 can launch only ~60. * Long-duration spaceflights beyond the earth- moon system. * Sending crew such as space tourists to the International Space Station.https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/news/a28440/spacex-new- rocket-design-mars-moon-earth-flights-plane/ * Mars transportation, both as cargo ships as well as passenger-carrying transport. * Long-duration flights to the outer planets, for cargo and astronauts. * Reusable lunar lander, for use transporting astronauts and cargo to and from the Moon's surface and Gateway in lunar orbit via Starship Human Landing System (Starship HLS); as well as more advanced heavy cargo lunar use cases that are envisioned by SpaceX but are not any part of the HLS variant that NASA has contracted with SpaceX for early design work. In 2017, SpaceX mentioned the theoretical ability of using a boosted Starship to carry passengers on suborbital flights between two points on Earth in under one hour, providing commercial long-haul transport on Earth, competing with long-range aircraft. SpaceX however announced no concrete plans to pursue the two stage \\"Earth-to-Earth\\" use case. Over two years later, in May 2019, Musk floated the idea of using single-stage Starship to travel up to on Earth-to-Earth flights at speeds approaching with an acceptable payload saying it \\"dramatically improves cost, complexity & ease of operations\\". In June 2020, Musk estimated that Earth-to-Earth test flights could begin in \\"2 or 3 years\\", i.e. 2022 or 2023, and that planning was underway for \\"floating superheavy-class spaceports for Mars, Moon and hypersonic travel around Earth\\".  Funding  SpaceX has been developing the Starship with private funding, including the Raptor rocket engine used on both stages of the vehicle, since 2012. In 2020, SpaceX has contracted with NASA to do limited early design work for 10 months on a human lunar lander variant Starship ‚Äì Starship HLS ‚Äì that might be used to land astronauts on the lunar surface as part of the NASA Artemis program after 2024. The development work on the new two-stage launch vehicle design is privately funded by SpaceX. The entire project is possible only as a result of SpaceX's multi-faceted approach focusing on the reduction of launch costs. The full build-out of the Mars colonization plans was envisioned by Musk in 2016 to be funded by both private and public funds. The speed of commercially available Mars transport for both cargo and humans will be driven, in large part, by market demand as well as constrained by the technology development and development funding. Elon Musk said that there is no expectation of receiving NASA contracts for any of the ITS system work SpaceX was doing. He also indicated that such contracts, if received, would be good. In 2017, the company settled on a 9 meter diameter design and commenced procuring equipment for vehicle manufacturing operations. In late 2018, they switched the design from carbon composite materials for the main structures to stainless steel, further lowering build costs. By late 2019, SpaceX projected that, with company private investment funding, including contractual funds from Yusaku Maezawa who had recently contracted for a private lunar mission in 2023, they have sufficient funds to advance the Earth-orbit and lunar-orbit extent of flight operations, although they may raise additional funds in order \\"to go to the Moon or landing on Mars\\". In April 2020, NASA announced they would pay SpaceX US$135 million for design and initial development over a 10-month design period for a variation of the Starship second-stage vehicle and spaceship ‚Äì a \\"Starship Human Landing System\\", or Starship HLS ‚Äì as a Lunar human landing system for the NASA Artemis program; NASA is paying US$579 million and US$253 million to other contractors developing competing lunar landing designs. In October 2020, NASA awarded SpaceX US$53.2 million to conduct a large scale flight demostration to transfer 10 metric tons of cryogenic propellant between tanks on the Starship vehicle.

The ceremony commemorates an infant baby who has reached three months, per the Pawukon calendar, or 105 days of age. The name \\"Nelu Bulanin\\" is from the Balinese language, \\"Nelu\\" or \\"Telu\\" meaning three and \\"Bulan\\" meaning month.  Description  Nelu Bulanin Ceremony in 2016 Hinduism is common among locals of Bali, with various local customs. The purpose of Nelu Bulanin is to purify a baby; the Balinese believe that the first three months are a crucial stage of a baby's development. At this age, babies begin to actively engage their five senses. It is believed that this development can affect their soul and that Nelu Bulanin keeps the baby's soul pure. There are two types of ceremonies - the Upacara Kecil (minor ceremony) and the Upacara Besar (major celebration). The Upacara Kecil is more traditional than Upacara Besar. It includes five stages: Panglepasan (discharge, release, or redemption), Penyambutan (welcoming), Jejanganan, Banten kumara, and Tataban.

It was not a good tank, being fairly primitive, but it was cheap to make.  Development  The tank was created as a joint venture by the Caterpillar Corporation and the Disston Saw Works. Caterpillar provided the chassis, which was from a standard Caterpillar Model 35 civilian tractor, and Disston provided the tank body, which was bolted on to the Caterpillar chassis. The Caterpillar track was lengthened by adding a road wheel to the front of the track assembly, but some examples apparently do not have this lengthened track. The Disston had a 37mm gun mounted in the body, and a turret with a .30 caliber (7.62 mm) light machine gun. It weighed about six tons, probably had a speed of 5 to 6.5 miles per hour, and had armor sufficient to stop small arms fire. The crew consisted of three men. At a cost of $21,000 (), the Disston was cheaper than similarly-armed tanks, but ‚Äì being quite slow, with tracks unsuited for difficult terrain, thin armor, a high boxy superstructure, and the engine exposed in the front ‚Äì was generally deemed unsatisfactory even so.  Operational history  A few were sold and delivered to Afghanistan and entered service there. Some or all of these still exist, in broken-down condition in Afghan scrapyards.

These occupations subject individuals to a great deal of traumatic events, resulting in a higher risk of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major despressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder (PD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Exposure to multiple traumatic stressors could also exacerbate other pre-existing conditions. The presence of any mental health disorders in these individuals can also be associated with diminished ability to work efficiently, early retirement, substance abuse, and suicide.  Types of first responders  The term \\"first responder\\" is a generic term referring to the first medically trained responder to arrive on the scene of an emergency. These can consist of fully trained positions such as law enforcement officers, firefighters, search and rescue personnel, paramedics, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), and emergency medical dispatchers (EMDs) but also includes passersby and citizen volunteers. Individuals who are certified or have training in the field can typically provide advanced first aid care, CPR, and use an automated external defibrillator (AED). These positions entail high levels of work related stress and repeated exposure to physical and psychological stressors. In addition to traditional first responders (e.g., police officers, firefighters, EMTs, and hospital providers), there are nontraditional first responders, including laborers and equipment operators. These individuals are also exposed to the aftermath of disaster scenes during their jobs, and face an increased risk for encountering physical injuries and developing psychological distress.  Types of trauma  In their line of work, first responders are exposed to a variety of graphic and grim circumstances and events, some directed at them and some directed at others. Examples of personal attacks may include being shot at, assaulted, or threatened. Examples of circumstances involving others include exposure to sexually assaulted children, domestic violence, watching someone die, or seeing mutilated remains. Because of this, first responders endure field specific trauma. = Law enforcement = The demand to care for and interact with all members of the community often results in compassion fatigue among police officers. Additionally, the need to care for each individual, and specifically any victims, on a crime scene can create a feeling of moral suffering, which can be further broken down into either moral distress or moral injury Moral distress entails experiencing pain and mental health issues that affect the individual in situations during which they are expected to make the correct decision but they are unable to do so due to an external barrier. They may also experience moral injury, which causes individuals to lose perception of the world as a safe place and other human beings as individuals they can trust. Furthermore, Police Complex Spiral Trauma (PCST) addresses the cumulative effect of trauma experienced by police officers over the course of their career due to the frequency of their exposure to trauma. = Firefighters and search and rescue = Firefighters may experience Repeated Exposure Trauma, as they are often faced with recurrent severe stress when responding to life-threatening incidents during which their goal is oftentimes to save lives. The severity of the incidents that firefighters are involved in, and the emotional skills needed to cope with this stress can lead to acute stress disorder (ASD) and, eventually, PTSD. Search and Rescue personnel are also repeatedly exposed to direct and indirect stressors as they are always putting their own safety at risk in order to come to the aid of others. Search and Rescue personnel share similar occupational experiences with firefighters, and the severity and degree of trauma of events that these teams must respond to might have an impact upon these individual's emotional and mental health. Both Firefighters and Search and Rescue personnel are also at great risk for developing compassion fatigue. = Paramedics = Paramedics, amongst other first responders, can suffer from posttraumatic stress symptoms and depressive symptoms as a result of repeated exposure to human pain and suffering on a daily basis. A study of paramedics reported more than 80% of paramedics in a large urban area experienced: the death of a patient while in their care, the death of a child, and violence. In addition to this, the same study reported that 70% had been assaulted on the job and 56% reported experiencing events which could have resulted in their own death. Often small scale triggers (in combination with larger events), such as the lonely death of an elderly person or a death by suicide which can trigger emotional responses. In a study conducted by Regehr et al., researchers aimed to better understand by what processes do lasting effects take hold. Researchers found that through emotional empathy, the process by which an individual shares or experiences the feelings of another, paramedics move beyond a cognitive understanding of loss or suffering in stressful situations to experiencing emotional empathy in these situations. = Dispatchers = Emotional stress is an intrinsic part of emergency dispatchers‚Äô occupational health; they work in critical situations, with an irregular work load, and no feedback regarding patient outcome. Acute stress is a fundamental adaptive response, but psychological stress at work can lead to illness and reduced productivity. Being at the beginning of the rescue chain, it is important that dispatchers are in good health to communicate vital information during critical phases of operations; errors can have serious consequences. Research has largely focused on trauma among more stereotypical first responders such as firefighters or police officers, however, there is an increasing amount of research investigating the biometric stress parameters such as heart rate among emergency dispatchers. One study found dispatchers had elevated heart rates and reduced heart rate variability at the beginning and throughout a shift; additionally dispatchers showed a significant increased risk of work disability as compared to a control group.  Prevalence of PTSD  PTSD is characterized by, \\"exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence\\" either directly or indirectly, intrusion, persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the event, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity following a traumatic experience. Symptoms must last longer than one month, cause clinically significant distress in social or occupational functioning, and not be attributed to other conditions or substances. Eighty percent of first responders report experiencing traumatic events on the job. As of 2012, the prevalence rates of PTSD were ‚Äú14.6% for emergency personnel, 7.3% for firefighters, 4.7% for police officers, and 13.5% for other rescue teams.\\" ‚ÄúNearly 400,000 first responders in the United States, and 10% worldwide are suffering from PTSD symptoms.‚Äù Paramedics have the highest prevalence of PTSD while police officers have the lowest. Paramedics respond to more emergencies than police and firefighters and do not undergo the same intense screening like police and firefighters. Since police officers carry weapons (firearms, batons, electroshock weapons, etc.), the hiring process is designed to find individuals with personality traits related to psychological resilience through psychological assessment. = Stigma and underreporting = Due to the stigma associated with having a mental health disorder among first responders, individuals at these jobs tend to under report symptoms to avoid judgment by peers and supervisors, demotion, or a decrease in responsibilities at work. On average, \\"about one in three first responders experiences stigma regarding mental health.\\" Other barriers associated with under reporting are a lack of knowledge of where to receive treatment, scheduling concerns, and fear regarding confidentiality.  Risk factors  Individuals who experience repeated traumatic events have an increased risk of developing PTSD. Additionally, the type of trauma, the first responder's personality traits, and their level of social support play an important role in the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Klimley et al. found that Canadian female police and firefighters were more likely to test positive for any mental disorder. Other types of first responders did not show a significant difference based on sex. Risk factors presented for law enforcement include ‚Äúproximity to the event, type of incident, occupational stressors, neuroticism, introversion, and poor coping skills.‚Äù Firefighters who display high levels of ‚Äúhostility, low self-esteem, neuroticism, previous trauma, and a lack of social support‚Äù are more at risk for developing PTSD. Location may serve as a risk factor, as urban police are more likely to be deployed in pairs and have structural support compared with rural police who are often deployed alone without access to the same support systems. Additionally, there is an increased risk for unmarried paramedics, canine handlers with insufficient training, and firefighters who experience an increased number of distressing missions. Suicide is considered high risk in law enforcement officers, but is not solely related to the exposure to a traumatic event. Lack of social support is significantly associated with an increase of feelings of hopelessness and suicide. Additionally, an increase in stress of administrative practices also increased feelings of hopelessness in this particular occupation. In 2017, 103 firefighters and 140 police officers committed suicide, compared to 93 firefighters and 129 officers died in the line of duty (being fatally shot, stabbed, drowning or dying in a car accident while on the job). = Comorbid disorders = Among law enforcement officers, ‚Äúchronic pain, cardiovascular problems, arthritis, substance use, depression, anxiety, and suicide‚Äù present comorbid with PTSD. Similarly, firefighters experience ‚Äúcardiovascular disease, respiratory problems, depression, acute stress disorder, interpersonal difficulties, substance abuse, and suicide.‚Äù Lastly, dispatchers can present with high cortisol and higher burnout rates with a PTSD diagnosis.  Pre-crisis education  Understanding and acknowledging that first responders are exposed to traumatic events is critical in the health and safety of a first responders career. =Awareness of available resources= Prior to a PTSD event, a first responder should be given the resources or be aware of what resources are available to them in the event of a traumatic experience. A list of resources can be found on the Code Green Campaign website. During orientation, training, or an academy, first responders should be told about any job-related resources available to them. This include Critical Incident Stress Teams, Peer Support Teams, or Employee Assistance Programs. =Screening= Prior to entering a first responder career, there is some evidence that screening can occur to help predict and train certain people who may have predictors of developing PSTD.Wild, J., Smith, K. V., Thompson, E., B√©ar, F., Lommen, M. J., & Ehlers, A. (2016). A prospective study of pre-trauma risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Psychological medicine, 46(12), 2571‚Äì2582. doi:10.1017/S0033291716000532 During this study, new paramedic students were evaluated based on multiple factors. These factors included things like: their psychiatric history, trauma exposure, neuroticism, perceived resilience to stress, and depressive attributions. During this two-year study, it was determined that first responders who were at risk for developing PTSD or major depression could be identified within the first week of their training. Those with a history of mental disorders are 6-times more likely to develop PTSD. It is important that providers receive adequate education on signs and symptoms of developing PTSD and know what resources are available to them because they are at a higher risk of experiencing a PTSD event. This screening tool should only be used to help a provider with the awareness of developing PTSD. It is illegal for an employer to screen or deny a provider based on these findings.  Treatment = Post-crisis interventions = Following a traumatic event, there are multiple treatments for post-traumatic symptoms used for individuals in these populations. Common treatment for first responders with PTSD are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), CBT as exposure therapy, prolonged exposure therapy (PE), brief eclectic psychotherapy (BEP), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD).  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviors. The American Psychological Association (APA) strongly recommends CBT for treating PTSD. Current evidence supports the use of CBT for first responders experiencing PTSD.  Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE)  The focus of Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE) is on learning how to gradually address traumatic memories. The goal of PE is to help the individual facing the trauma to stop avoiding the memories. The American Psychological Association (APA) strongly recommends PE for treating PTSD. In a study of police officers, treatment of PTSD using PE led to PTSD remission.  Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy (BEP)  Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy is a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic approaches. The focus of BEP is specifically on feelings of guilt and shame. Following treatment of BEP, 86% of first responders with PTSD return to work.  Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)  Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) focuses on the memory of a traumatic event. EMDR follows a structured eight phase process: * Phase 1: History- taking * Phase 2: Preparing the client * Phase 3: Assessing the target memory * Phases 4-7: Processing the memory to adaptive resolution * Phase 8: Evaluating treatment results EMDR was found to be more effective at treating PTSD among first responders than a stress management program.  Critical Incident Debriefing (CISD)  Critical Incident Debriefing (CISD) is a type of group debriefing that takes place following exposure to a potentially traumatic event. CISD follows a seven-stage protocol (Introduction, Facts, Thoughts, Reactions, Symptoms, Education, and Re-entry). CISD was developed as part of program called Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) which includes individual counseling, pre-exposure interventions, family support and referral for further therapy. Although CISD is commonly practiced with police officers, firefighters, and paramedics, this treatment has been associated with an increased risk of PTSD and alteration of memories of the traumatic event, therefore is not recommended.  Pharmacotherapy  There are a number of medications that have been found to be beneficial in the treatment of PTSD. The most common are Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines. However, benzodiazepines are not recommended as a treatment method for PTSD on their own as they have been observed to increase early incidence of PTSD after treatment, have worsening symptoms during withdrawal and have a high likelihood of developing dependence. = Barriers to treatment = Barriers to receiving mental health care are not uncommon, however first responders face unique challenges. In a review of studies assessing barriers to care among first responders, 33.1% of participants reported experiencing some barrier to receiving treatment for PTSD. Common barriers included: difficulty scheduling appointments, not knowing where to go to get help, difficulty taking time off work, leaders discouraging getting treatment, not having transportation, fear of a negative impact on their career and fear that the services are not confidential.  PTSD Regulations  In many states, there are no regulations regarding the protection or treatment for first responders after experiencing a traumatic event. The following states have enacted some type of legislation regarding PTSD and first responders: Colorado: Recognizes PTSD under workers‚Äô compensation for first responders Florida: Recognizes PTSD under workers‚Äô compensation for first responders Idaho: Recognizes PTSD under workers‚Äô compensation for first responders Maine: Created true occupational presumption for PTSD Massachusetts: Ensures that first responders have access to mental health resources after a traumatic event. Minnesota: Recognizes PTSD under workers‚Äô compensation for first responders New York: Allows first responders to claim for mental injury after extraordinary work-related stress South Carolina: $500,000 fund to assist first responders with costs associated with the treatment of PTSD Texas: Recognizes PTSD under workers‚Äô compensation for first responders Vermont: Created true occupational presumption for PTSD, recognizes PTSD under workers‚Äô compensation for first responders Washington: Recognizes PTSD under workers‚Äô compensation for first responders  References  Trauma and stressor related disorders ","title":"Trauma and first responders"},{"id":"59119220","text":"Study South Africa is an annual publication of the International Education Association of South Africa (IEASA) in association with Universities South Africa (USAf), and serves as a guide to higher education in South Africa.

The film was directed by Raaj Shaandilyaa and distributed by Pen India Limited. Ayushmann Khurrana plays a cross-gender actor whose female voice impersonation begets attention from others. It also features Nushrat Bharucha, Annu Kapoor, Manjot Singh, Vijay Raaz, Abhishek Banerjee, Raj Bhansali and Nidhi Bisht in supporting roles. Filming started in December 2018. It was theatrically released on 13 September 2019 and turned out to be a blockbuster success. The film earned 200 crores worldwide on a budget of 28 crores.  Plot  Karam Singh is good at impersonating the female voice from a very young age and hence keeps getting female lead roles in mythological plays (Ramayan) since his childhood. Although he protests every time that would settle for a much smaller but male character but is insisted upon pursuing the female character and takes it. He is currently unemployed and gets to perform these roles because it fetches him good money. His friend Smiley runs a liquor shop and supports him in every one of his endeavors. His father, Jagjeet Singh runs a shop dealing in funeral items and is sunk deep into loans he owes to various banks. Due to low turnover, he is unable to pay back the EMI's. While returning from an unsuccessful interview for a job, Karam sees an ad that promises Rs. 70,000/month salary. He reaches the given address, but the employer Mauji 'W Ji' (Rajesh Sharma) rejects him outright without inquiring about his qualifications. Karamveer pleads, and finally, Mauji relents and shows him his call center where only ladies work. The call-center is entertaining fantasies of people who call them, mostly men who don't have a partner in life. Karamveer is shocked but quickly regains his composure, and answers a call in a female voice for Ms. Pooja (who works at the call center), who is frequently on leave. Mauji is impressed with his skill and immediately hires him and gives him Rs. 25,000 as advance payment. Karamveer tells his father that he has got a job at an MNC and hands him the advance payment he received. His father is happy to receive this news, while Karam celebrates with his friend Smiley. Later at the job, he garners a good fan base because of his sweet voice and sharp presence of mind. He comes across Mahi at his customer's home where he went to deliver products asked from his father's shop. He is smitten by her beauty and catches her attention with some witty lines. Later they come across each other while waiting in a queue, and Karam impresses her with his funny personality. Soon love blossoms between the two and they get engaged. At his job, Karam comes across a few people who call him regularly: Toto, a spoilt brat; Rajpal, a policeman by profession who writes couplets; Roma, editor of a magazine; Karam's father Jagjeet and Mahi's brother, Mahinder. Karam, initially unknown of their real identities, eventually, comes across them in his life and is surprised to know their identities. Eventually, everyone becomes obsessed with Pooja, impersonated by Karam, because of her sweet voice and friendly nature. They fall in love with Pooja and everyone wants to marry her. Karam, frustrated with such unsolicited requests, wants to quit. His employer, Mauji rejects his resignation and blackmails him that he would expose his identity to his neighborhood, which might jeopardize his marriage. Karam decides to tell everything to Mahi but fizzles out when he realizes her brother Mahinder is also a fan of Pooja. He figures out that if he talks to his callers rudely, they would get along with their realities and stop calling him. This move backfires as everyone becomes more obsessed with Pooja, Toto attempts to commit suicide, and Rajpal threatens to abandon his wife. Karamveer starts threatening these people to stay away from Pooja or otherwise face the consequences in an attempt to stop them from marrying Pooja. In one such event, Karamveer as Pooja tells Roma that she is in love with her boyfriend Anurag. Roma insists upon meeting Anurag to see if he is a good guy. Karamveer meets Roma at a mall posing as Anurag. After the meeting, he comes across Mahinder, shopping at the mall who overhears Roma and Karam and tells it to Mahi, also present at the mall. Roma, already skeptical of Karamveer alias Anurag's character, tells Mahi that Karam is engaged to Pooja when Mahi reveals that she is Karam's fianc√©, and his duplicity is exposed. Mahi, heartbroken, leaves from the mall when Karamveer is unable to explain the situation to her. Confusion breaks out in the mall and Pooja's identity remains tumultuous. Karam chases Mahi and takes her to his office and explains everything. Mauji misbehaves with Mahi and she slaps him in front of his staff. Karamveer defends Mahi and leaves the office, further enraging Mauji. Mahi reconciles with Karamveer. Later, she attends the play where Karam is playing the role of Radha. At the end of the play, Rajpal arrives with Mauji who claims that Karam has killed Pooja. Karam recites one of Rajpal's couplet. Rajpal is taken aback since he shared the couplet with Pooja and nobody else. Karam reveals that he has been impersonating Pooja all this time. This is followed by an emotional speech by Karam on growing loneliness amongst people. Roma comes with the real Pooja and exposes Mauji who is arrested by Rajpal. Toto, Mahinder, Jagjeet, and Roma learn that Karam has been impersonating Pooja all along. Finally, everyone refuses to marry Karam except Mahi.

She concurred with Taran in praising performance of Khurrana and Kapoor. Criticising director for losing subject of the film she concluded, \\"However, his [Shaandilyaa's] hesitation to delve deeper into the subject makes it score less on the report card. If you are looking for a light-hearted comedy this weekend, [this film] should definitely be on your list.\\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave two stars out of five and felt the film was had many good ideas but those were not executed, stating, \\".... these ideas remain half- baked, being mouthed strictly as meaningless dialogue for either laughs or claps\\".

His father was a lawyer and farmer who served multiple times as a town selectman. Burdick worked as a teacher in the winter when his duties on the farm would allow him time. In 1830, he was appointed as an assistant in the Vermont General Assembly. In 1831, Burdick's brother General Justus Burdick went to Michigan at the suggestion of his acquaintance from school, Elon Farnsworth, who later became attorney general of Michigan. Once there, and informed about the good prospects of the village of Bronson by Lucius Lyon, a future U.S. senator, Justus Burdick purchased a portion of the village from its founder, Titus Bronson. He returned to Vermont and sent Cyrus Burdick to Michigan to act as his agent. The following year, Burdick oversaw construction of the first tavern and hotel in Bronson, the Kalamazoo House, on behalf of his brother. He moved his family into the hotel portion and operated it for two years. He also purchased a sawmill during this time, where most of the wood for the hotel was milled.

With a constructed area of about , it is located to the west of Muhammad Ali Square. It is considered the largest marine aquarium in South America. It was inaugurated on October 31, 2016, in a ceremony that was attended by the former minister of Tourism, Marx Beltr√£o. The public aquarium was made at Porto Maravilha, an urban operation that aims to revitalize the Port Zone of Rio de Janeiro. The building occupied by AquaRio has a total of 5 floors and 28 tanks with various types of fish. In the tanks, about 4.5 million liters of salt water are stored, in addition to 8 thousand animals of 350 different species. The building formerly belonged to Companhia Brasileira de Armazenamento (Cibrazem), now Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (CONAB).  Main features  Tunnel inside in one of the aquariums Multicolor fishes and corals in one of the AquaRio tanks. AquaRio brings together about 8,000 animals from 350 different species from all oceans. Among the main species present in the aquarium are: the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum); the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus); the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus); and the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus).

In 2018, the jockstrap was auctioned off and was bought by comedian John Oliver, who in turn donated it to Alaska's last operating Blockbuster Video store.  Original use and subsequent ownership  Russell Crowe, 2017 In Cinderella Man, New Zealand actor Russell Crowe played American boxer James J. Braddock, who was the world heavyweight champion from 1935 to 1937. In the film, Crowe wears the jockstrap in the scene in which Braddock wins the championship. After the film was produced, Crowe took possession of various props from the film, including the jockstrap, and incorporated them into his collection of memorabilia.  Sale and Blockbuster Video donation  In April 2018, Crowe auctioned off over 200 props he owned that were used by him in his various films in a \\"divorce auction\\" to celebrate his split from Danielle Spencer. He included the jockstrap as part of the auction as \\"a piece of whimsy and a bit of a gag\\". After the announcement of the auction, Bloomberg listed the jockstrap as one of the most bizarre items for sale. The jockstrap sold for $7,000 ($8,450 with Buyer's Premium), more than ten times the estimated price of $500 to $600, which also led to a flurry of coverage on this high sales price. Crowe later admitted that he was surprised that it turned out to be one of the most popular items of the sale. The jockstrap and other items were bought by the HBO television show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, which Oliver revealed on his April 15, 2018 show. As a thank-you, Crowe donated the money Last Week Tonight paid to the Australia Zoo which used it to fund the \\"John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward\\". Oliver jokingly declared he had achieved everything imaginable and could now end his show. The recipient of the memorabilia, the Alaskan Blockbuster store that was located at 5600 DeBarr Road Subsequently, the memorabilia, including the jockstrap, were donated to the last operating Alaskan Blockbuster Video store in Anchorage. The jockstrap remained there in a glass case along with other items from the Crowe auction and became a local attraction. However, the items failed to prevent the store from closing in July 2018. Afterwards, the owners of the Alaska store sent all their memorabilia to the last remaining Blockbuster Video store in the United States, located in Bend, Oregon. However, Crowe's jockstrap was missing from the items sent to this store, with Oliver claiming in September 2018 that he did not know its location. Reappearance In November during the final episode of the 2018 season of Last Week Tonight, Oliver revealed that the show had reacquired the jockstrap and used it in a comedy skit. The skit is a spoof of The Fast and the Furious starring Armie Hammer and five wax US presidents which Oliver's show had previously acquired from a wax museum sale. In the end of the skit, Crowe appears as a mob boss holding the jockstrap he had ordered stolen. As of the airing of the final Oliver episode, it remained unclear who owned or possessed the jockstrap.

A fan favourite, the song was released on 4 December 2018 as the fourth single from her second studio album El Mal Querer (2018). The track was co-produced by Rosal√≠a and Spanish musician El Guincho and contains an interpolation of \\"Cry Me a River\\" by Justin Timberlake. Background In an interview with Beats 1, Rosal√≠a said she was inspired by an erotic club in Barcelona called Bagdad and by Timberlake's \\"Cry Me a River\\": \\"He heard the song and said, \\"Yes, you can use the melody\\"; I was so excited because he never approves anything.\\" In this song, Rosal√≠a represents a woman drowned by her anguish and grief due to a bad love. The woman does nothing to prevent it, but flooded by her own tears she finds salvation. The liturgy, a worship ceremony, ends with a rebirth. The song's lyrics, part of a narrative arc that spans the whole album, revolve around the main character of the story being seen alone crying in the streets at night, clapping her hands in sorrow \\"like she's praying to the rhythm of buler√≠as\\", and then being rescued by a \\"fallen angel\\". Music video The music video for \\"Bagdad\\", directed by Helmi, was filmed in Paris and released on December 4, 2018 on YouTube. It features Rosal√≠a as a strip-club dancer, dancing in a pole wearing a blonde wig and a red latex mono similar to the one Britney Spears used in the music video for \\"Oops!... I Did It Again\\" in 2000. She goes to the place's bathroom after having a heated up phone conversation, where she starts crying to the point that the water from her tears fills up the whole room, drowning her. The singer tweeted that the music video is \\"For all those who were heartbroken and drowned in their sorrow.\\" A portion of an unreleased track \\"Lo Presiento\\", initially intended for El Mal Querer, can be spotted at the beginning of the video.

A fan favorite, the song is the final track off the singer's second studio album El Mal Querer, which was released on November 2, 2018 through Sony Music. The track has been streamed over 20 milion times since its release.  Background and composition  In 2017, Rosal√≠a graduated from flamenco studies at the Catalonia College of Music in Barcelona. She presented her bachelor's degree project El Mal Querer, written by herself alongside Pablo D√≠az-Reixa and ex- boyfriend Ant√≥n √Ålvarez, at that time and earned her a graduation with honors. The project was presented to Sony Music the next year and was revamped and commercialized in November 2018 worldwide. The project is presented as a musical representation of the 13th century Occitan novel Flamenca, whose author remains unknown. This romance is about a young girl who marries a man who locks her up in a tower after discovering she has a lover and, in major part, because of jelousy and also due to the woman's undeniable beauty, which he is afraid of sharing. After her lover finds her and kills her husband in \\"Maldici√≥n\\", Rosal√≠a makes a statement about celebrating her independence, abuse of power and swearing that she will never forget how badly she has been treated. Being a little over a minute and a half, the song is the second shortest track in the album or the shortest track in it the interlude isn't counted.  Critical and commercial reception  The final track of El Mal Querer was very well received by critics. The Guardian stated that \\"A Ning√∫n Hombre\\" is \\"a pretty visceral experience where her voice is powerful and gutsily emotive\\". The track peaked at the 35th position of the PROMUSICAE chart without being a single or a promotional track and lasted on it for three consecutive weeks. 5 other album tracks entered the chart. The song was the inspiration for many protestors who attended the International Women's Day March in 2019 and 2020 in many parts of Spain and Latin America.  Live performances  \\"A Ning√∫n Hombre\\" was performed during some shows in Spain and London in the summer of 2018 as well as during her El Mal Querer worldwide tour, which ran from March to December 2019. She also performed the track during the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards in Newark alongside \\"Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi\\" and \\"Aute Cuture\\".

The Australian Journalists Association took the case to the Industrial Relations Commission seeking her return to work for five days a week on full pay. The AJA's South Australian secretary told an IRC hearing that Stott Despoja's stress was caused by an incident arising over a disagreement with the editor of The Advertiser, Piers Akerman, over the placement of a column, and which the AJA alleged resulted in Akerman threatening Stott Despoja with violence. The dispute went to the Supreme Court of South Australia, where the Advertiser's appeal against the claim was dismissed. Stott Despoja retired from the paper in 1992. In 2008, Stott Despoja returned to the media, writing a column titled \\"The Third Age\\" for the Adelaide Review. Awards and honours Stott Despoja was inducted into the South Australian Media Awards Hall of Fame in 2013. In the 2017 Australia Day Honours, she was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM), for service to the print media as a journalist. In November 2018, she was inducted into the Australian Media Hall of Fame. Personal life In 1963, Stott interviewed Croatian migrant Mario Despoja for The Advertiser about his success on the quiz show Coles ¬£3000 Question. They married ten months later, but divorced after twelve years. Their daughter, Natasha Stott Despoja, was a Senator for South Australia from 1995 to 2008, and leader of the Australian Democrats from 2001 to 2002.

November 1950 in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Hungary), is a Swiss-Hungarian architect, theorist, historian and Adjunct Professor Emeritus of Architectural Theory at the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Morav√°nszky is regarded as one of the world's leading architecture historians of Central European architecture.  Biography  Morav√°nszky studied architecture at the Budapest University of Technology where he received his diploma in 1974. Subsequently, he worked in Budapest at K√ñZTI, an architectural design office specialized for public buildings. In 1977, he started his doctoral studies at the Technical University of Vienna as a Herder-Fellow, receiving his degree in 1980. In 1983 he was appointed Editor- in-Chief of the architectural journal of the Association of Hungarian Architects, Magyar √âpit≈ëm≈±v√©szet. He was invited as an Alexander-von-Humboldt Research Fellow to the Zentralinstitut f√ºr Kunstgeschichte (Central Research Institute for Art History) in Munich (1986-1988). He worked as Research Associate at the Getty Center in Santa Monica, California (1989-1991) and as Visiting Associate Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1991-1996). Between 1996 and 2016 he was in charge of the Chair of Architectural Theory at the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture at the ETH Zurich. He was Visiting Professor at the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design in Budapest in 2003/04 and at the Universidad de Navarra in Pamplona in 2017/18.  Writings on architecture  Morav√°nszky is especially well known for his writing on twentieth-century architecture in Central Europe, and for his role in the development of a theory of materiality in architecture. His books include Competing Visions: Aesthetic Invention and Social Imagination in Central European Architecture, 1867-1918 (1998) which was the first systematic work focusing on the development of architectural modernism in the countries of the Habsburg Empire and its successor states. ‚Äú√Åkos Morav√°nszky‚Äôs Competing Visions: Aesthetic Invention and Social Imagination in Central European Architecture 1867-1918 turned modernism into a simple architectural alternative among others‚Äù ‚Äì wrote French architectural historian Carmen Popescu. Results of this research were published earlier in his books Die Architektur der Donaumonarchie (1988) and Die Erneuerung der Baukunst: Wege zur Moderne in Mitteleuropa (1988). William M. Johnston, the outstanding American historian focusing on European cultural history emphasized in his book Zur Kulturgeschichte √ïsterreichs und Ungarns 1890-1938 (2015) Morav√°nszky‚Äôs pioneering achievement and his ‚Äúvirtuosity in weaving together architectural and intellectual history‚Äù. An important aspect of Morav√°nszky‚Äôs work was the ethnographic research of architects into the material culture of the village, and their interest for vernacular buildings. In August 1996, he organized an international conference at the Internationales Forschungszentrum Kulturwissenschaften in Vienna. The papers of the conference have been published in Morav√°nszky‚Äôs edited volume Das entfernte Dorf (2002). The significance of this achievement has been recognized by scholars working later on issues of regionalism and vernacular architecture. The research that started with his doctoral thesis and early writings on the architecture in the Habsburg monarchy, and concluded with the series of conferences East West Central on architecture and urbanism in post- war Europe, held at the ETH Zurich, with particular emphasis on the former ‚ÄúEastern Bloc‚Äù countries. The results of the conferences have been published in three volumes. Reviewers praised the results as the ‚ÄúRe-unification of Europe in architectural history‚Äù (Andr√°s Ferkai in Ars Hungarica) and as ‚Äúone of the most interesting works dealing with the period‚Äù (Michal Jan√°k in docomomo) The question of materiality was discussed in seminars held at the doctoral school of the Institut gta / ETH Zurich, the Architectural Association in London, the Moholy-Nagy University of Art in Budapest, and at the Universidad de Navarra in Pamplona. He summed up his stance towards materiality as in his book Metamorphism: Material Change in Architecture (2018) as follows: \\"The interpretation of material outlined in this introduction progresses from constructional principles via cultural meaning to sensory experience. Accordingly, the technical literature is progressively complemented by texts which use the power of material as an argument for a post-human materialism and as a tool for the ecologization of culture. This book is neither a construction handbook nor a work of architectural history, neither a treatise on the iconology of materials nor a plea for a new materialism. By focusing our attention on ideas that have arisen in close connection with the practice of design it seeks to significantly advance the discourse about material. The examination of Semper‚Äôs theory and the presentation of theoretical discussions about materiality cannot be separated from the investigation of architectural examples. The identification and recognition of materiality can counter the dematerialization which globalization is leaving in its wake.\\" In 2015 a collection of Morav√°nszky's writings over a period of over 20 years was collated and published by the gta Verlag under the title Lehrger√ºste.

A member of the Democratic Party, her district encompasses Agua Dulce, Castaic, Simi Valley, the far northern portion of the San Fernando Valley, as well as most of the Santa Clarita Valley. On October 28, 2019, Smith announced her candidacy for the United States House of Representatives in the 2020 California's 25th congressional district special election. She became the Democratic nominee for the seat and was defeated by Mike Garcia on May 12, 2020. In another election on November 3, 2020, she will once again face Garcia for a full congressional term. Early life and career Smith was born in a U.S. Army hospital in 1969 in W√ºrzburg, West Germany (now Germany). Her parents returned to the United States when she was six months old, settling in Fortville, Indiana, where her father, Jerry, found work at RCA Records. They later moved to Terre Haute before finally settling down in the Santa Clarita Valley in 1979. The eldest of three children, she graduated from William S. Hart High School in Santa Clarita and attended College of the Canyons. She received her Bachelor of Arts in political science from University of California, Los Angeles in 1993. Smith then worked for the United States Department of Education as a policy analyst during the Clinton administration. She has served two terms on the board of the Newhall School District. California State Assembly In 2016, Smith ran in California's 38th State Assembly district. The seat was open after Republican incumbent Scott Wilk decided to run for state senate. Although she led the candidate field in the open primary in June, she eventually lost to incumbent Republican Dante Acosta, 52.87% to 47.13%, in the November general election. In 2018, she ran again for the 38th district against Acosta and won 51.2% to Acosta's 48.8%. She currently chairs the Joint Legislative Committee on Emergency Management.  2020 California's 25th congressional district elections  On October 28, 2019, one day after Katie Hill announced her intent to resign from Congress, Smith announced her bid to fill Hill's vacated congressional seat. Hill endorsed Smith as her successor. Smith's State Assembly district covers more than half of the congressional district. Smith picked up endorsements from the Los Angeles Times, Indivisible, and prominent Democratic figures such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, and Governor Gavin Newsom. Smith's eleven opponents in the March 3, 2020, primary election included former U.S. Representative Steve Knight, progressive political commentator Cenk Uygur, and foreign policy adviser for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign George Papadopoulos. In December 2019, EMILY's List endorsed Smith, as did the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee the following month. Smith declined to attend a Democratic primary debate held on January 9, 2020, in Palmdale, California, citing her legislative duties in the State Assembly. On March 3, 2020, a primary for the special election was held to fill the remainder of Hill's term at the same time that a primary election for the 117th United States Congress took place. Smith finished first in both elections. On May 12, 2020, a runoff was conducted to fill the remainder of Hill's term, which she lost to Republican Mike Garcia, a former U.S. Navy pilot. In another election on November 3, 2020, she will face Garcia once again, this time for a full two-year congressional term.

The Methodist Union and after The church with its Soldiers' Home and Hall served Methodist locals for over a hundred years while the support for servicemen provided by the Soldiers' Home was transferred to the Smith-Dorrien Home in 1925. When Wesleyan and Primitive Methodism united in the Methodist Union in 1932 the Methodist congregation in the town worshipped at the two Methodist churches on Grosvenor Road and the Ebenezer Primitive Methodist chapel on Ash Road until the closure of the latter in 1958 when it was sold as it no longer met the needs of the congregation. A plot of land opposite on the corner of Herrett Street and Stone Street was purchased and the stone-laying ceremony for a new all-purpose building took place on 26 April 1958. As it opened on to Stone Street that became its title. After the Grosvenor Road building was sold by the Aldershot Military Trust for ¬£500,000 in 1988 the congregation joined other churches in the Methodist Circuit, some joining Stone Street when the name was changed to Aldershot Methodist Church.

The TIGER domain was first documented by cell biologists Christine Mayr and Weirui Ma at the Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in 2018. The letters TIG stand for TIS granules and letters ER stands for the endoplasmic reticulum. TIS granules form a network of interconnected proteins that bind RNA and the endoplasmic reticulum is where protein synthesis occurs. This combination of the TIS proteins and the endoplasmic reticulum creates a distinct place in which mRNA and proteins collect, interact, and grow. The striped pattern of the TIS granules that are interweaving with the endoplasmic reticulum also resemble the orange and black stripes of a tiger.

Starting in 1983 she undertook a succession of lengthy visits to the Caribbean - notably St. Lucia, Grenada and Jamaica - in order to undertake cultural comparative and ethnographic studies.

Speech patterns vary by age, era, and location. According to Helmut Gl√ºck (2005), the term is not strictly defined. Heinrich L√∂ffler refers to Jugendsprache as a transitory non-standard language (‚ÄúLebensalter-Sprache‚Äù: ‚Äúage-language‚Äù)Heinrich L√∂ffler: Germanistische Soziolinguistik. Erich Schmidt Verlag, Berlin 1985, S. 127, 132. . with attention to the time period. In German and West European philology, Jugendsprache is considered to be both a non-standard language and a sub-form of the standard language. These characteristics and patterns can be categorized as typical or atypical. Orality and informal language are characteristics of German youth language. Neuland, Eva (2008): Jugendsprache. Eine Einf√ºhrung. T√ºbingen. Researchers claim that its main function is achieving separation from adult speech and to signal group solidarity. Groups  Researchers have described multiple groups/forms, including Comicdeutsch (German comic language), school language, Denglisch, army slang, university student language, drug scene jargon, graffiti jargon, hip-hop jargon and Internet jargon. Most of these forms are not restricted to teenagers, however, teenagers are the instigators and primary speakers. Features Youth language displays exaggerations, emphasis, exaggeration, intensification, wordplay, provocation, humor, irony, playfulness, expressiveness and emotion more often than is found in adult communication. Speakers often use metaphors, e.g., ‚Äúnatural woolly socks‚Äù for \\"hairy legs‚Äù. Abbreviations are common, such as ‚Äúso‚Äônem‚Äù instead of ‚Äúso einem‚Äù. Youth are more likely to import Anglicisms, for example, ‚Äúcool‚Äù is typical. Acronyms such as \\"YOLO\\" ('You only live once'), have increased in frequency, to condense text messages. Syntactic variations in spoken language include repetitions, ellipsis, word order variation and incomplete sentences. Filler words such as ‚Äúund so‚Äù (and so on), and interjections and hedges (e.g., ‚Äúirgendwie‚Äù), are typical.  Research  Researcher-curated dictionaries/style guides create an always-dated image of youth language that misses the way young people actually speak, because that youth language evolves too quickly to be reflected in formal research.Ein Klassiker dieser Gattung: Claus Peter M√ºller-Thurau: Lass uns mal ‚Äône Schnecke angraben.

When it opened, 3,000 inmates were transferred in from Braiman Prison. In 2015, the regional director for prisons Mani Al-Otaibi said it was the most advanced prison in Saudi Arabia, with state of the art surveillance technologies. The facility is used to hold high profile political prisoners, as well as members of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. It holds male and female prisoners, as well as some small children of female prisoners. It has been alleged that the female inmates have been tortured. Detained female activists were electrocuted and flogged repeatedly, according to Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch. An anonymous Saudi official denied that torture was condoned by the state. Saudi Arabia claims that inmates get \\"top treatment\\". The Badawi siblings are currently being held in this prison; with the Government of Canada demanding their release, and subsequently the Saudi Arabian Government expelled the Ambassador of Canada to Saudi Arabia and recalled the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to Canada, along with diplomatic staff and Saudi Arabian students in Canada, some have sought asylum as a result of this.  Allegations of torture  Several Saudi Arabian activists, including women have been reported to be detained in the Dhahban Prison without any charges since May 2018. The activists have been repeatedly tortured by electrocution and flogging, leaving many of them unable to walk or even stand properly. According to the three testimonies obtained by Amnesty International, one of the activists was forced to hang from the ceiling.

He would improve his play steadily, His first major tournament win would come in 2017 with the World Championship Series (WCS) J√∂nk√∂ping European Qualifier win, beating Zanster, Mana, ShowTimE, Namshar and Elazer. He would take 2nd place in the main event after beating Stephano, PtitDrogo and Elazer, but losing 3-4 to Neeb in the Finals. In 2017, he also won the European Qualifier for WCS Valencia, taking out Stephano, Bly, HeRoMaRinE and Elazer twice. During the main event, he was knocked out in the quarter finals by TRUE.

In the main event, he did not lose a map during group play, beating ShoWTimE, Minato, Has, Elazer, Bly and Lambo. During playoffs he beat Neeb in the quarterfinals, but lost 0-3 to the eventual champion Maru. =2018= His first premier tournament win came in 2018 when he won WCS Leipzig, beating MaSa, Nerchio, SpeCial and ShoWTimE. He went on to win all 3 other major WCS tournaments in 2018, getting the first clean sweep, or Grand Slam, in WCS history. In WCS Austin, he defeated Kelazhur, HeRoMaRinE, Lambo and MaNa. In WCS Valencia, he beat Scarlett, Reynor, HeRoMaRinE and Has. In WCS Montreal, his domination of the 2018 WCS circuit was underscored by beating JonSnow, Scarlett, Lambo and Reynor. Serral also showed his prowess in the Korean scene at the 2018 Global Starcraft II League (GSL) vs. the World tournament where he took home a $26,901 prize over several of the strongest Korean players, beating Kelazhur, INnoVation, Dark and Stats. The year end WCS Global Finals at Blizzcon featured 2018's eight best non-Koreans and eight best Koreans, including Cho \\"Maru\\" Seong Ju, who qualified for the Global Finals by making a clean sweep of GSL. Serral would win this tournament beating sOs, Zest, Dark, Rogue and Stats to become the first non-Korean to do so in the history of the Starcraft franchise. =2019= To start off the year 2019, Serral competed in the WCS Winter Europe Tournament, where he was expected to win. However, he was defeated 4-3 by 16-year-old Italian Zerg player, Reynor, in the Grand Finals in an incredibly close series. A month prior, he was also defeated by INnoVation in the WESG Finals. Not to mention, earlier that week he was eliminated in the Round of 8 of IEM Katowice to soO, the eventual winner of the tournament. After not losing a tournament in 2018, then falling short of victory in his first three tournaments of 2019, many started to question his dominance over the scene. After the conclusion of WCS Winter, the Challengers for WCS Spring quickly started where Serral easily won, defeating ShoWTimE in the finals 4‚Äì2. During the main tournament, Serral quickly advanced to the playoff round. He defeated Lambo and TIME to advance to the semifinals. In the semifinal, he swept Reynor 3-0 to advance into the Grand Final‚Äîas a revenge for WCS Winter. In the Grand Final, Serral won 4-0 versus the Mexican Terran player SpeCial. His victory in WCS Spring was his Fifth WCS Circuit title. However, he lost again to Reynor in the WCS Summer Grand Final 4‚Äì2. In his home tournament in Finland, Asus ROG Assembly 2019, he was projected to be one of the favorites to win the tournament, but lost to the strong Korean Protoss player Stats 2‚Äì3 in semifinals. Later during the summer, he won the GSL vs. the World tournament on Korean soil by defeating another Zerg player, Elazer, in the finals 4‚Äì2. The first time in the history no Korean players appeared in the final match. The win was Serral's second consecutive in the tournament. Serral won the last 2019 WCS Fall circuit tournament at Montreal against Reynor 4-1, and broke the previous WCS record by achieving an unprecedented map score of 17-1 - with his only map loss in the finals. Serral won the WCS season with 10,200 points, having already earned the top seed in Blizzcon 2019 with tournament victories in WCS Spring and WCS Fall tournaments. Despite of being one of the main favorites to win The Blizzcon 2019 he lost the semifinal match against his season long rival Reynor 2-3, the eventual tournament runner-up, after tight series of best of 5. In the season's last premier tournament HomeStory Cup XX held at Tropical Islands Resort in Germany, Serral came back to the winning ways defeating Reynor twice (2‚Äì1 and 3‚Äì2) in the finals after winning the double-elimination loser bracket final against Innovation 0-3, to which he was first relegated from winners' round 2 by him with map score 3‚Äì1. Serral played crucial role in Nationwars 2019 tournament when Team Finland (ZhuGeLiang, Serral, TheMusZero) defeated Team Korea in the final match 5-3 becoming the champion. For recognition and honor of Serral's accomplishments and continued success in StarCraft II esports, the President of Finland Sauli Niinist√∂ invited him to take part to the traditional Independence Day Reception in the Presidential Palace, Helsinki, December 6th 2019.

The recipient of many international prizes from violin competitions and recording labels, Epstein's work as a soloist and chamber musician is extensive. Equally extensive is his influence as a professor of violin, which extends over more than half a century. Epstein continues his work at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Saar in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany, where he has lived and taught since 1978.  Family history  Joshua Epstein was the only child of Anna (n√©e Schwertfinger) and Julian Epstein. His mother was born in present-day Izmir, Turkey to parents of Romanian-Jewish origin. Anna's family, moving southward across the Levant, soon arrived in Aleppo, where she and her sisters were schooled in French by the nuns of a local convent. By this time, she was one of nine living children, six girls and three boys. The family later settled just north of the ancient port city of Jaffa in the newly-founded municipality of Tel Aviv. Joshua's father's family had emigrated to Essen, Germany from Galicia several years before the outbreak of World War I. Julian Epstein (1905-1984) was the youngest of six brothers. By the 1930s, he had become increasingly desperate to escape the growing threats of the Nazi Party. After completing three years of formal education as a carpenter in Holland, Julian managed to get permission to join his brother, Walter, in Tel Aviv in 1936.  Early life and education  Joshua Epstein was born on November 14, 1940, as war raged across the Continent. His parents continued to live in the same small apartment in which he was born, on HaShoftim Street, until 1975. As a child, Joshua spoke French with his mother, German with his father and Hebrew outside of the home and in school. Joshua received his first violin lessons from Yariv Ezrahi when he was 8 years old and progressed quickly. He moved to Belgium to pursue a career in violin when he was 19 years old. In Brussels, Epstein was admitted to the Royal Conservatory and studied as a student of Arthur Grumiaux for two years, later also completing a special degree in chamber music. He then transferred to the class of Andr√© Gertler and entered the Queen Elisabeth Music Chapel (1962-1965) under his tuition. After graduating, Epstein served as Gertler's assistant at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater in Hanover, Germany (1966-1972) and won prizes at several international violin competitions.  Awards  1st Prize, City of London Carl Flesch International Violin Competition, 1968 In 1965 Epstein flew to Helsinki, Finland for the first ever International Jean Sibelius Violin Competition. He came away with second prize, the first having been won by the young Soviet talent, Oleg Kagan. He then entered the Queen Elisabeth International Violin Competition in the city of his alma mater in 1967. As a finalist, he performed the Sibelius Concerto, Op. 47; the Hindemith 4th Violin Concerto and the Bartok 1st Rhapsodie, et al. A year later, Epstein went on to win first prize at the 1968 City of London Carl Flesch Competition. The Queen Elisabeth Competition takes place every four years. Epstein entered again in 1971 and was again a finalist. This time, he played the Mendelssohn Concerto, Op. 64; the Wieniawski Polonaise in D major.  Career  After his competition successes, Epstein launched his career as a soloist and over the next 40 years performed with many orchestras across the Continent: the Oslo Philharmonic, Bergen Philharmonic, RIAS Berlin, Saarl√§ndischer Rundfunk, NDR Hamburg, Bayerischer Rundfunk, Bayerische Staatsoper, N√ºrnberger Symphoniker, Berliner Symphoniker, to mention just a few. He is especially known for his interpretations of Bach, Mozart, Paganini and Bart√≥k and has given recitals in France, Germany, Belgium, England, Scandinavia, Italy, Spain, the United States and Canada; Israel, Turkey, Iran and South Korea. Between 1971 and 2005, Epstein performed all 24 Paganini Caprices in concert six times. In 1997 he recorded them for the Agora label in two days. = Chamber music = The Bartholdy String Quartet was founded in 1968 by a group of young musicians performing and teaching at music academies in the German cities of Karlsruhe and W√ºrzburg. When an accident forced their original viola player to resign, the group's first violinist, J√∂rg-Wolfgang Jahn, decided to change instruments. Thus the Bartholdy Quartet was in need of a first violinist. In 1972, Epstein traveled to Linkenheim, near Karlsruhe, to meet with them. With Jahn playing viola, Annemarie Dengler-Speermann as the group's cellist, Max Speermann as second violin and Epstein as the new primarius, they toured throughout Europe, North America and the near east to great acclaim. The group worked together from 1972 until 1978, earning the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis and the Grand Prix du disque for their recordings of Mendelssohn and Schubert. Later, from 1988 until 1993, Epstein served as musical director of the Saarbr√ºcker Kammermusiktage, an annual chamber music festival in Saarbr√ºcken. = Teaching = Joshua Epstein's violin teaching was influenced by the Hungarian violinist Andr√© Gertler and by the Feldendrais Method. Among his many teaching positions, Epstein has served as Professor of Violin at the University of Music W√ºrzburg (1974-1978), Conservatoire de Strasbourg (1994-2005), the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Saar (1978‚Äìpresent) and the Dokuz Eylul University State Conservatory in Izmir, Turkey (2012-2018). Epstein has given masterclasses in cities around the world, including Italy, Belgium, France (Moulin d'And√©), Turkey, South Korea, et al. Epstein is the director of the annual International Summer Academy Schwetzingen-Worms, an annual two-week music festival and master class founded in 2003.

Spinning Silver was a 2019 Hugo Award for Best Novel Nominee, a 2018 finalist for the Nebula Award for Best Novel, and a 2019 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fantasy. The novel is loosely based on the tale of Rumpelstiltskin and explores how debt and gratitude shape relationships. Synopsis The story of Spinning Silver unfolds in the voices of several characters, but primarily in the voices of three young women who struggle against strong evil forces, in an imaginary medieval eastern European kingdom called Lithvas. Miryem takes over her father's unsuccessful money-lending business in the peasant village where hers is the only Jewish family. Her success at \\"turning silver into gold\\" attracts the attention of the Staryk king, who rules a winter kingdom full of magic. The Staryk are using their power to make the winters in Lithvas longer and longer, blighting the crops and impoverishing the kingdom. Wanda and her brothers are peasants in Miryem's village, whose drunken father sends Wanda to work for Miryem to pay off his debts. In Miryem's family they find warmth and safety, which they loyally try to return when Miryem is taken away to the Staryk kingdom. Irina, the daughter of a duke in Lithvas, has a Staryk great- grandmother and three magical items of Staryk silver. A demon of flame, who holds power over the handsome tsar of Lithvas, plans to devour her. Irina, with Miryem's help, offers the demon a bargain: if he will spare her \\"and all she holds dear,\\" Irina will help him to devour the Staryk king in her stead. Irina and Miryem hope that this will push back the encroaching winters the Staryk are causing.

One of the main characters of the first season, he is portrayed by Colin Hanks. He appears as a guest in season 2, with Hanks briefly reprising his role in a cameo. Character summary Grimly is a protagonist of the first season and appears as a guest in the second season. In the first season, he is introduced as an officer, and is a supporting figure in the solving of the case involving Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) and Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman). By the end of the season, he is working as a mailman following the inquiry into shooting Molly during the white out gun fight between Lorne Malvo and Mr Numbers and Mr Wrench. It is not stated whether he was fired or resigned from the Duluth PD. =Character arc= After Chief Vern Thurman (Shawn Doyle) and Lester Nygaard's (Martin Freeman) wife is murdered, Gus Grimly pulls Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) over for speeding. Malvo presents Grimly with two choices: press the issue (and face death), or allow Malvo to leave (and live). Malvo drives away as Grimly, confused, does not report the incident. Molly tells Bill Oswalt about her visit to Lester, but he is only more upset that Molly is still harassing Lester. Meanwhile, Malvo informs Don Chumph, the fitness instructor for Stavros's wife, that he knows he is the blackmailer. Malvo takes over the blackmail scheme and torments Stavros by exploiting his extreme religious beliefs. He kills Stavros' dog, replaces his pain medication with Adderall, and sabotages the plumbing system, causing pig blood to flow out of the shower. Gus finally tells his angry superior that he let Malvo off with a warning for speeding, and he is sent to Bemidji to inform their police department. He meets Molly for the first time and after seeing him with Greta, she invites them over to her father's restaurant where they share a friendly conversation. Molly Solverson is visiting Gus Grimly in Duluth to discuss the recent murders when gunshots are reported. At the scene they find a car wreck that Numbers and Wrench staged to trap Malvo. Numbers and Wrench then attack with automatic weapons; Malvo escapes the ambush and captures and tortures Numbers to tell him who sent them. Numbers replies, \\"Fargo\\" before Malvo fatally slits his throat. Molly and Grimly get separated and Gus accidentally shoots her. At the hospital, Grimly agonizes over accidentally shooting Molly and destroying her spleen, but the injury is not fatal. The unloaded gun Lester placed in Gordo's backpack is discovered at his school. The Nygaard home is searched by police and the incriminating evidence that Lester planted in Chazz's gun safe is found. Meanwhile, Molly Solverson returns to work and unsuccessfully attempts to reopen the Lester Nygaard investigation. At the Duluth hospital, Lorne Malvo kills a police guard and gives Mr. Wrench the handcuff key to escape, telling him that he and Mr. Numbers came closer than anyone else ever had to besting Malvo. Malvo confesses that he killed Mr. Numbers and tells Wrench to come find him if he still wants revenge. In Fargo, FBI Agents Pepper and Budge, having been assigned to surveillance during Malvo's 22-homicide gun rampage and missed his having walked right by their car en route to entering the building, are demoted to file clerks. A year passes, and Gus Grimly, now a mailman, is happily married to Molly Solverson as they eagerly await their first child's birth. In Las Vegas, Lester, who has married Linda, receives an award for Insurance Salesman of the Year. While at the hotel bar, Lester spots Malvo, who now sports grey hair and a goatee rather than brown hair and a full beard. While conversing with his companions, Malvo calls himself \\"Dr. Michaelson\\". At home, Molly Solverson receives word that another of Lester's wives has been murdered. Molly goes to the crime scene where she meets Lester. Lester tries but fails to retrieve the tickets from the jacket. The police bring Lester back to the station, where he refuses to answer any questions. Lester is allowed to return home the next morning, but must be accompanied by FBI agents Pepper and Budge. Malvo goes to a used car lot and chats up one of the salesmen (the same young husband that Lester failed to sell life insurance to a year earlier) about one car that resembles an undercover police car, convincing him to allow the two to go for a test drive. Malvo later sees Lester being taken home by the FBI agents, and follows in his own car. During his trip home, Lester is asked about and solves the riddle of the fox, the rabbit and the cabbage. Once they return Lester home, the two FBI agents remain outside. Apparently forced by Malvo, the salesman drives his car up to Lester's house, attracting the attention of the agents; Malvo takes advantage of their distraction to murder both of them. It is implied that Malvo then kills the salesman. Malvo enters Lester's house, and each stalks but fails to kill the other. Malvo strikes Lester in the face with Lester's award, bloodying his face and mirroring the injury inflicted on Lester by Sam Hess a year earlier. Though Lester's gun jams, Malvo's foot is caught in a bear trap left by Lester, and he escapes severely injured. Malvo retreats to his cabin to treat his injury, not knowing that Grimly has already found it. Grimly tells Malvo that he has solved his riddle posed a year earlier, and kills Malvo. When the police arrive, they find Malvo's trove of audio tapes, including the one containing Lester's confession for the murder of his first wife. Two weeks later, Lester, now the subject of a manhunt after his murder of Pearl has been revealed, is shown on a snowmobile in Glacier National Park. Lester is recognized by law enforcement officers and tries to escape, only to crash his snowmobile. Desperate, he continues on foot, only to crash through thin ice, presumably meeting his end, and revealing that the scene shown at the beginning of the episode depicted Lester's fate. At home, Molly receives the news of Lester. Gus tells her that he's receiving a citation for bravery, but he feels that she deserves it. Molly reassures her husband that this is his moment. Reception Hanks received positive reviews for his portrayal. IndieWire said of the first season finale: \\"And so in the end, it wasn‚Äôt intrepid detective Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) who killed the menacing Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton), but her husband, Gus (Colin Hanks), a fearful ex-cop who seemed temperamentally better suited to his new job as a rural mailman. Molly didn‚Äôt even get to slap the cuffs on Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman), whom she‚Äôd pursued for more than a year; like the movie‚Äôs Jerry Lundegaard, Lester fled town, only instead of being captured he fell through a hole in the thin Montana ice.\\" References Television characters introduced in 2014 Fictional American police officers Fargo (TV series) characters Fictional sheriffs ","title":"Gus Grimly"},{"id":"59120551","text":"Xolani Ronald Sotashe is a South African politician who is Leader of the Opposition in the Cape Town City Council, Leader of the African National Congress in the Cape Town City Council, Chairperson of the African National Congress Dullah Omar regional branch, Member of the Cape Town City Council and Chairperson of Subcouncil 9.

She is a human rights activist and the leader of the Badi movement, which has been actively protesting for the recognition of the rights of its community, including end of untouchability and prostitution, land ownership and citizenship.  Early life  Uma Devi Badi was born in 1965 in Thapagaun, in the Salyan District of Nepal. From a young age, she started out life as a prostitute, the only profession available to women of the Badi caste at that point in time. At the age of 21, she married Prem Bhatta, from the Brahmin caste. Their inter-caste marriage created a scandal at the time, since the Badi caste is considered one of the lowest in Nepal and is treated as untouchable. Badi has no children of her own, but instead raised two of her sister's sons.  Activism  Uma Devi Badi refused to settle for society's expectations of women of her caste and escaped life as a prostitute in order to work towards offering her community better opportunities for their future. At the age of 40, with the support of Action Aid, she became head of the local organisation Community Support Group and set up a hostel for 25 boys and girls of the Badi caste in a rented property in Tikapur, western Nepal. The children are given accommodation there and sent to the local school as well as being given extra support after school with their literacy and numeracy skills. The success of this project has led to a larger project currently under construction which aims to host over 100 children in future. Two years after setting up the hostel, in 2007, Uma Devi Badi became the leader of a movement protesting for the rights of the Badi community. This became known as the 48 day-long Badi movement. During that period, Uma Devi Badi led approximately 500 Badi activists from 23 districts from their villages to Singha Durbar in Kathmandu. Upon their arrival, they staged peaceful protests outside the prime minister's office and the Pashupatinath Temple. Their demands were for the government to enact the 2005 Supreme Court Order to improve the living conditions of the Badi community with a 26-point list of issues to be addressed. These included end of prostitution and untouchability, permanent shelter for an otherwise nomadic community, registration of their births and citizenship in the mother's name for their children. When their demands remained unheard, Uma Devi Badi escalated the protest, removing her clothes from her top half and hanging from the gate of the seat of government while chanting slogans. Other women in the protest followed her example. This behaviour caught the attention of the media and the issue was given international coverage forcing the government int action. On 10 September 2007, the government agreed to meet with Uma Devi Badi and work towards introducing a public residential program for the Badi community. In recognition of her activism, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women during 2018.  2017 elections  In 2017, Uma Devi Badi was elected as a member of the National Assembly for Province No. 7. She became the first ever elected official representing the Badi community. Uma Devi Badi ran for office citing that, since 2007, the efforts of the Nepalese government to improve living conditions, education and opportunities for the Badi community have been slow. Uma Devi Badi stated that she hoped to accelerate those changes by working from within the government.

Founded by Rabbi Aharon Leibowitz in 2012 in Jerusalem, Israel, Hashgacha Pratit offers alternative halachic services in life-cycle events, rabbinical training, and other courses in religious education. It has provided private kashrut supervision for restaurants, worked on raising public awareness and finding loopholes in the laws to circumvent the Chief Rabbinate‚Äôs monopoly, first regarding Kashrut, by leading the movement to open the kosher food market to competition, and today regarding Orthodox wedding ceremonies. The term ‚ÄúHashgacha Pratit‚Äù means ‚Äúdivine providence,‚Äù but can also be translated to mean ‚Äúprivate supervision,‚Äù a pun on the private organization‚Äôs halachic kashrut supervision.  Background  In Israel, the Chief Rabbinate holds a monopoly on religious services such as conversion, marriage, divorce, and kashrut. In 2017, only 20% of the public said they trusted the Chief Rabbinate. By 2012, some organizations started to provide religious services outside the Rabbinate‚Äôs authority, but there were none dealing with kashrut. The goal of Hashgacha Pratit is not to bring down the Rabbinate, but rather to provide an alternative for restaurants and their customers who want truly kosher food without the corruption they claim is practiced by the Rabbinate. = Kashrut = Many Jews who observe kashrut only eat in restaurants which have a certificate on the wall declaring that the establishment‚Äôs food is kosher and supervised by a mashgiach. In Israel, the Chief Rabbinate has the exclusive authority to grant a certification that an establishment is kosher. In 2015, 79% of Israeli Jews said they were in favor of ending the Rabbinate‚Äôs monopoly over kashrut certification. In 2012, Rabbi Aharon Leibowitz founded Hashgacha Pratit and they began to form relationships with establishments that wanted a way around the Rabbinate‚Äôs supervision, which could be corrupt due to lack of competition. By 2016, 27 restaurants around the country were associated with Hashgacha Pratit. In June 2016, 2 restaurants associated with Hashgacha Pratit brought the Chief Rabbinate to the Israel Supreme Court, which ruled against the restaurant owners. The court decision greatly limited their ability to certify kashrut, forbidding their certificates from using the words ‚Äúkosher,‚Äù ‚Äúhalacha,‚Äù ‚Äúin accordance with Jewish law,‚Äù ‚Äúhashgacha‚Äù (supervision), and any words ‚Äúhaving associations with kashrut.‚Äù In 2017, Rabbi Oren Duvdevani, a reputable Orthodox Kashrut expert, joined the organization as head of kashrut supervision. Public awareness spread and restaurants and patrons came to understand that a Hashgacha Pratit certificate is valid in accordance with Jewish law and began to support the mission of the organization. The organization reworked their certificates to fit the restricted loopholes of the court decision, now calling them ‚ÄúAgreements of Trustworthiness.‚Äù They continued to rally support from the public and supervise establishments throughout Israel, still practicing according to Orthodox law. More restaurants, and eventually hotels, switched from Rabbinate to Hashgacha Pratit supervision. = Court decision = On September 12 2017, Hashgacha Pratit returned to the Supreme Court with over 50 restaurants and the public on their side. The decision came that the authority to grant kosher certificates still belongs to the Rabbinate, but establishments have the right to present their standards of kashrut.https://en.idi.org.il/articles/18710 The Supreme Court ruled that the ‚ÄúLaw Against Kashrut Fraud‚Äù is to ensure kosher food being presented properly. The president of the Supreme Court, Miriam Naor, stated ‚ÄúA food establishment which does not have a kashrut certificate [from the Rabbinate] cannot present itself as kosher, but this does not prevent it from giving a true presentation in writing which details the standards it observes and the way these standards are inspected.‚Äù = Standards = Hashgacha Pratit is committed to Orthodox halachic standards of kashrut. Their certification entails that dairy restaurants are completely dairy or pareve, dairy comes from certified kosher milk, all meat in meat restaurants is kosher (i.e. it comes from kosher animals and was properly slaughtered), flour is sifted by kosher processes, and that vegetables are washed in the kosher manner. Their certificates declare these standards and reads, ‚ÄúThe business has committed to making the kitchen, storeroom and any place in the business and its computer systems open to Rabbi Duvdevani and his team at any time they want, without prior arrangement for the purposes of oversight and inspection of the business‚Äù Hashgacha Pratit also employs women as mashgichot, kosher supervisors. Although the Rabbinate has never hired women, there is no halacha stating that women cannot serve as mashgichot. In March 2018, Hashgacha Pratit passed its kashrut department, and head of department Rabbi Oren Duvdevani, to Tzohar, another alternative Orthodox organization. Tzohar Food Supervision took over the supervision of all businesses associated with Hashgacha Pratit, so that Hashgacha Pratit could move onto other initiatives. The public has generally responded well to the mission of Hashgacha Pratit, since many communities have long been weary of the danger of the monopoly and the services provided which they felt were substandard.https://en.idi.org.il/articles/18710 Some rabbis have provided halachic reasons to abolish a monopoly over kashrut.https://mosaicmagazine.com/picks/2018/06/a-biblical-case-for-ending- the-israeli-chief-rabbinates-monopoly-on-kosher-supervision/ As observant people accept the kashrut standards of Hashgacha Pratit (now Tzohar), the Rabbinate's control and monopoly over kosher food gives way to a more competitive market.  Weddings  In July 2018, Hashgacha Pratit began a new initiative called Chuppot to offer Orthodox wedding services outside the authority of the Rabbinate. The name comes from the chuppah, the canopy used in a Jewish wedding ceremony, also used to describe the process of a Jewish marriage ceremony. Chuppot was the first organization to provide any couple with halachic Orthodox wedding services outside the framework of the Chief Rabbinate. Rabbi Aharon Leibowitz, head of Hashgacha Pratit, said about the new weddings initiative, ‚ÄúThis attitude is a result of policy, not Jewish law. This policy has led to the public crisis of confidence [in the Chief Rabbinate], and the monopoly of the rabbinate on religious services in the state distances these couples from Judaism.‚Äù = Processes = Hashgacha Pratit has eighteen rabbis, men and women, performing halachic Orthodox weddings. The services are offered to three main groups: * Immigrants from the former Soviet Union and their children, who identify as Jewish but do not have the documentation to prove it (because of Soviet suppression of religion), and are not recognized as Jewish by the Rabbinate. * Orthodox converts who are not recognized as Jewish by the Rabbinate. * Couples who want halachic Orthodox weddings, but refuse on ideological grounds to hold them under the Rabbinate. The wedding division of Hashgacha Pratit is headed by Rabbi Chuck Davidson. They will accept any couple who says they are Jewish, unless there is reason to doubt them. They will provide wedding services to Orthodox converts, after checking their conversion documents. Couples being married through Chuppot must sign certain documents before their service: * Declaration that they are both Jewish, not already married, and that the couple does not consist of a Kohen marrying a divorced woman (which is forbidden under halacha). * Agreement that if they separate, they will pursue a gett, a religious divorce. (This prevents mamzerut, children born through illicit relationships.) * Halachic prenuptial agreement which sets out financial sanctions if one partner refuses to consent to divorce, preventing the case of agunot, chained women. In 2013, the Law for Marriage and Divorce said that any couple that does not register their wedding through the Rabbinate, as well as the Rabbi who performs the wedding, is liable to a two year jail sentence. Hashgacha Pratit claims that this law does not apply to couples who have been refused service by the Rabbinate. They are working to revoke the law in the Knesset. Many Israeli couples choose to hold civil wedding ceremonies abroad and return home to register their marriage with the Ministry of Interior. The amount of couples opting for this route has increased by up to 4% as the public grows more dissatisfied with the Rabbinate. These couples can also come to Chuppot to perform a religious ceremony when they return to Israel. The Rabbinate cannot interfere because the couples are already legally married. = Outreach = As with Hashgacha Pratit‚Äôs kashrut initiative, the goal of Chuppot is not to bring down the Chief Rabbinate, but to provide a better alternative that is less invasive of privacy, less gender discriminatory, and less prohibitive of certain egalitarian elements of the wedding ceremony. In 2018, Targum Shlishi, a foundation dedicated to creative change in Jewish life worldwide, awarded a grant to help Chuppot market itself to a broader audience in Israel.

He later served as Secretary of Political Action of the New Generations (NN.GG.) of the People's Party (PP), reading in 1994 his PhD thesis in History at the National University of Distance Education before a tribunal formed by historian Javier Tusell, Juan G√≥mez Casta√±eda, fellow GEES colleague Florentino Portero, as well as two members of the Congress of Deputies representing the PP, Crist√≥bal Montoro and Luis Gamir Casares. After the win of the PP in the 1996 general election, he became and assistant to the new Director General of the Civil Guard, Santiago L√≥pez Valdivieso. = First spell at Cortes Generales = Interviewed by 20minutos.es in March 2011 He was elected Senator in 2004 general election, representing the province of Palencia. Aligned to the most reactionary wing of the PP, he acquired a political profile bashing the PSOE in the Senate, with the later party having arrived to power after the general election. In 2005, Cosid√≥ derided Gregorio Peces-Barba, the new High Commissioner for Support to the Victims of Terrorism and one of the Fathers of the 1978 Spanish Constitution, as \\"High Commissioner for (offering) dialog and shelter to terrorist executioners\\". He also adhered to the conspiracy theories surrounding the authorship of the 11-M train bombings in Madrid. He was elected member of the Congress of Deputies in the 2008 general election, also representing Palencia. He was re-elected in the November 2011 general election. = Director General of the Police = Appointed in December 2011 (after the win of the PP in the general election and the subsequent arrival to the premiership of Mariano Rajoy) as Director General of the National Police Corps (CNP), Cosid√≥ took office on 2 January 2012. During his spell as director of the CNP, Cosid√≥ created in 2012 the Strategic Planning and Coordination Unit (Unidad de Planificaci√≥n Estrat√©gica y Coordinaci√≥n), of uncertain functions, as purposed solely towards analysis, the special unit worked as sort of full-blown intelligence agency, thus it got the moniker of \\"la CIA de Cosid√≥\\". After taking office, new minister Juan Ignacio Zoido re-shifted the high-ranking officials of his Ministry in late 2016, removing Cosid√≥ from office. = Return to the Senate = La Raz√≥n. In December 2016, Cosid√≥ returned to the Senate, as he was designated Senator by the Cortes of Castile and Le√≥n, with the sole support in the regional parliament from the PP's parliamentary group. After the ascension of Pablo Casado to the presidency of the People's Party (now in the opposition after the successful vote of no confidence in Mariano Rajoy) in the summer of 2018, the new PP leader appointed Cosid√≥ as Spokesperson of the PP parliamentary group in the Spanish Upper house, where the party enjoyed an absolute majority of senators. In November 2018 a Whatsapp message of Cosid√≥ directed at the members of the PP group at the Senate became public. In that message, Cosid√≥ took pride in the deal tentatively agreed between the PP and the PSOE to renovate the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ), as the collegiate body responsible for appointing judges would have Conservative Manuel Marchena as president, while he also emphasized that the PP would somehow retain a \\"backdoor control\\" over the 2nd Penal Hall of the Supreme Court (responsible for judging legislators and government members) and would \\"preside\\" over the 61st Hall (responsible for the illegalization of political parties). Harshly criticised over this perceived partisan understanding of the judicial power and with the political rivals asking for his resignation, he lamented the tone of the message but declined to step down, as he declared to enjoy full support from his party leader, Casado. Marchena renounced then to the potential candidacy to the dual presidency of the CGPJ and the Supreme Court, and the PP declared any sort of deal with the PSOE to renovate the body \\"broken\\" as long as the minister of Justice Dolores Delgado did not resign, thus de facto prolonging the mandate of Carlos Lesmes. In 23 July 2019, the Parliament of Castile and Le√≥n dismissed him and appointed Javier Maroto to replace him.  Ideology and thought  A practicing Catholic, Cosid√≥ espouses a deeply religious and conservative worldview. He is considered a \\"hardliner\\" within the PP. In 2008 Cosid√≥ declared Muslim immigrants to be \\"a risk to our democracy\\" because, with their customs and ideas, they would bring to Spain a lifestyle presenting \\"serious incompatibilities\\".

Life  He was born as Isaak-Leib Fishelevich Wolkenstein () at 1858 presumably in Taganrog. Lev Wolkenstein was brother of who also was a Russian lawyer. Lev Wolkenstein studied at Taganrog Classical Male Gymnasium () at the same time as Anton Chekhov. When Chekhov was at seventh grade and Wolkenstein was at undergraduate eighth grade, all students at Wolkenstein's class except Wolkenstein rejected to write essay prescribed for them. This caused conflict between Wolkenstein and his classmates. One of them called Wolkenstein as \\"zhyd\\" and Wolkenstein slapped him in the face. For this assault and battery Wolkenstein had been expelled from gymnasium. After that Chekhov had induced classmates to write a collective statement that all of them will leave gymnasium if Wolkenstein will not be reinstated. That had effect and he was reinstated and then graduated from gymnasium. Then Wolkenstein studied at faculty of law of Saint Petersburg State University. In 1888 he was a lawyer assistant () and took part in a trial on case of poisoning. Maximenko (–ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–µ–Ω–∫–æ) has been accused of poisoning her husband but she had been acquitted.

Chekhov was coming to this Wolkenstein's house and (possible) discussing with Wolkenstein about staging of Chekhov's vaudevilles and plays in theatres of Rostov-on-Don. According to Chekhov, at 1896 Wolkenstein also had dacha in Kislovodsk.

It was designed by William Reynolds and built during 1838. It is also known as Phillips Foote Restaurant or Phillip's Foote Restaurant. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History =Ownership form 1800s to 1900= The first development on the subject site took place in relation to the Assistant Surgeon's residence which was later occupied by Francis Greenway. Although the subject site appears to have been undeveloped, the site contained a wall associated with the residence. Following Frederic Wright Unwin's acquisition of the legal title to the land, known as Allotment 12, Section 84 in the town plan of Sydney, he registered a 21-year lease with William Reynolds, who had recently constructed a building on the leased land, described in the 1838 leasehold document as \\"the messuage or tenement thereon lately erected and built by the said William Reynolds\\". Reynolds may have informally leased the land from Unwin prior to erecting the building on it. He had already acquired the land fronting Harrington Street to the west, where he built a number of cottages in the1820s. Reynolds arrived in Australia in 1817 to serve a life sentence. He received a Ticket of Leave about 1826 and a conditional pardon in 1835. About the same time, possibly in response to a housing shortage in the 1840s, Reynolds constructed two rows of buildings in an L-shape fronting present-day Suez Canal as well as a right of way on land he owned. Another more substantial building was erected by Reynolds to the rear of the present-day Phillip's Foote building fronting George Street. These buildings were described by 'Old Chum': 'Off the [Suez] \\"Canal\\" was a blind court with some half dozen houses occupied by, to all appearances, some of the roughest of the rough.' Rate records of the building fronting George Street dating to 1845 show that it was a two-storey brick residence of nine rooms, with an attic and shingled roof. An 1841 plan labels the site as 'Mr Chapman's Butcher Shop'. The present-day Phillip's Foote building fronting George Street, after changing hands a number of times in the 1840s and 1850s, came to be owned and occupied from by William Yeoman (1833-1886), Painter/Glazier/Plumber. Yeoman leased the building to Thomas Playfair, butcher, between 1869 and 1886. Playfair (1832-1893) was elected to the City Council as a representative of the Gipps ward in 1875, and served as an alderman until 1893. He was mayor in 1885. Among his achievements with the Council were the widening of George Street North and the establishment of the Homebush sale yards as an alternative to the Glebe Island abattoirs in 1882. He advocated a better city water supply and is remembered as someone who 'instead of trying to sink the shop and kick away the ladder by which he rose, he stayed where he had always lived The Rocks, long enough to earn the respect and love of his neighbours.' Playfair moved to 103 George Street about 1887, and the Phillip's Foote building was converted to an oyster saloon under the management of Frederick Rossich (also referred to as Bossich). Under the ownership of John Gill from 1885 and the State government from 1901, the place continued as an oyster saloon until 1906 under several different proprietors, all of whom migrated from the region of Dalmatia, Austria (presently Croatia). Most of them became naturalised Australians after Federation. In 1905, Giuseppe Nardi took over the oyster saloon, and in 1906, the place was listed in the Sands Directory as both an oyster saloon and wine bar. Nardi arrived in Australia as one of the survivors of the Marquis de Rays' ill-fated attempt to colonise part of New Guinea in 1880. As the ship's supplies diminished and disease felled numerous passengers, an attempt to reach Australia for provisions was thwarted when their ship in disrepair. Anchored off Noum√©a, the surviving passengers on the ship were rescued and brought to New South Wales for settlement. Eventually the surviving families' settlement on the North Coast came to be known as New Italy. =Ownership from 1901 to 1970s= Giuseppe Meani, an Italian who was naturalised in 1903, succeeded Nardi as proprietor of the wine bar between 1906 and 1909. He was followed by Casper Schelling (1909-1912), I. R. Tolamini (1913-1915), and Alfret Meynet and his wife (1915-1920). Pesman and Kevin in A History of Italian Settlement in New South Wales note the attractions of operating a small independent business to migrant Italians, which may be said to apply equally to migrants from Dalmatia. Small businesses require little capital outlay, and could be operated economically with the use of family labour. Living on the premises reduced the requirement to navigate in the English language. Where job prospects for migrants amounted to menial labour or dangerous work, running one's own business provided a self-determined means of income, and generally allayed exposure to the hostilities and attitudes of bosses and anti-immigration campaigners. From 1922, the ground and first floor were tenanted by a number of manufacturing companies, agents, and a newsagent. This trend continued until at least 1933 (when the Sands Directory ceased). From 1943, John J. Cohen rented the premises for the use of repairing musical instruments at a week. Cohen's lease continued until his death in 1965, when his wife took over the lease. Their business was called \\"Harmony House\\" and operated at 177 George Street, while they used part of 101 George Street as an office, and sub-let part to Collopy & Co. Although full tenancy records for 101 George Street are not available, reference is made in 1965 to the lease of the top floor (probably referring to the first floor) by A. J. Robb and its occupation by the Merchant Navy Allied War Service Association, which at times held functions with up to 40 people in attendance. The structure of the top floor was considered dangerous enough in 1965 to terminate the lease. Rita Cohen of Harmony House continued to lease at least part of the ground floor while the condition of the building gradually worsened, according to condition reports carried out periodically by the Maritime Services Board. In 1967, the iron roof and box gutters were considered beyond repair, and water entering the roof caused the electric wiring to short circuit. Not surprisingly, Rita Cohen terminated her tenancy in the same year, and the building sat empty as the Sydney Cove Authority's plans for redevelopment were waylaid by the Green Bans efforts. Internal memos in the early 1970s show that the Authority considered demolition of the building to be the best course of action, however they held concerns as to what the reaction to demolition would be by groups such as the \\"Save the Rocks\\" committee. An engineer reported on the bowing and cracking of the front fa√ßade in 1970, and stated that movement had taken place over a long period and did not require urgent demolition for public safety. Props were the preferred solution, and the building was temporarily braced against its neighbour across Suez Canal. =Ownership since 1970s= In 1971, the Authority heard complaints from the tenant at 99 George Street about water seeping from 101 George Street into her basement. Water was found to be standing deep in the cellar of the Phillip's Foote building. Shortly thereafter, the City Health Department ordered that the \\"accumulation of miscellaneous rubbish, including scrap wood, scrap iron, papers, empty bottles, tins and vegetative matter which is likely to afford harbourage for vermin\\" be removed from the premises. The Authority hired a contractor to carry out the order, clean the interior of the building generally, remove the existing cast iron fireplaces for storage at the Authority's offices, board up all entrances, and to demolish the timber and corrugated iron shed abutting the northern brick wall of the yard and the timber frame in the southeast corner of the yard. In 1973, demolition of the building was again considered by the Authority, as it had become \\"something of an eyesore and has [been] so for the past six years or so.\\" However, a memo by the Professional Services Manager stated that the building should be retained because of its contribution to the block bounded by George, Argyle, and Harrington Streets. The building itself \\"does not have any historical merit, it is considered to be an important element in the whole.\\" About the same time the firm of Dredge & Evans, via their architect Philip Cox, sought a tenancy in The Rocks area to transfer their dormant Australian Wine License. The Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority hesitated in offering any more than a three-year lease because of uncertainty as to the building's future, the lack of money to restore it for the short term, and the absence of any survey plan for the area, which would be required for registering a lease of any more than three years with the Registrar-General. Dredge & Evans took a tenancy at will and began renovations to the building in July 1974. The work involved gutting both the Phillip's Foote building and the Cook House to the rear, and the near-complete rebuilding of the Phillip's Foote building front and rear walls. Notes on the approved Building Application plans indicate that the external walls were to be \\"dismantled with care saving building materials which may be reused in the reconstruction.\\" The four buildings to the north of the Phillip's Foote building were found to be slipping and pushing against 101 George Street. A bulwark was required to keep No. 101 vertical, and to stop the neighbours from slipping against it. A bar, previously located at Playfair's Buildings, Harrington Street (which was demolished for construction of Clocktower Square) was installed in the front room of the building. Having spent $220,000 on the renovations, Dredge & Evans opened the Phillip's Foote wine bar and restaurant in 1976 and reported in May of the same year that they served 200 to 700 meals a day, and were open seven days a week. Their trading capacity was limited by their usable floor area, and Authority approved their expansion into the area of the former Yeoman's Store building to the north (which had already been demolished in the early 20th century). The work was documented and carried out in 1977. New openings were made in the yard wall at the back of the Phillip's Foote building and in the north wall of the Cook House in order to access a new roofed verandah which opened into a courtyard dining area. About the same time, the Authority were restoring the stone flagging of Greenway Lane. Creating the opening in the yard wall enabled the flagging work to be carried through the Phillip's Foote outdoor dining areas to access Suez Canal for the first time in the history of the site. Phillip's Foote continues to be operated by the company which carried out the renovation work.  Description  No. 101 George Street is a plain two storey brick shop and residence, originally built in 1838. The building has been subject to modifications since but generally in a sympathetic manner. It has a simple early Victorian Regency style shopfront. Style: Georgian; Storeys: 2, plus attic and basement; Roof Cladding: Iron sheeting; Floor Frame: Timber = Condition = As at 5 March 2009, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Terraced into hill slope at rear. Cellars below. However extant archaeological resource may exist form the date of the building's construction.  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, the Phillip's Foote Restaurant and site are of State heritage significance for their aesthetic, historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The simple Victorian Regency shopfront of the Phillip's Foote Restaurant contributes to the aesthetic and historic diversity of the George Street streetscape. The site and buildings at 101 George Street, The Rocks, are of heritage significance for the State of NSW for their historic and aesthetic contribution to The Rocks area, which, on the whole, is of State heritage significance. Both the Phillip's Foote building and the Cook House make important aesthetic contributions to the streetscapes of George Street, the Suez Canal, Nurses Walk, and Greenway Lane. The Phillip's Foote building, a good representative example of a simple two-storey commercial building, is of historic significance as a site continuously used for retail and commercial purposes since its construction in 1838. The reconstruction works carried out in the 1970s under Phillip Cox, architect, are of value for their ability to interpret the history and early character of the buildings. 101 George Street, The Rocks was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site of 101 George Street is historically significant as a site continuously occupied since 1788. The Phillip's Foote building, constructed in 1838, is of significance as part of the early commercial development of The Rocks area, with a history of tenancies typical of the area's association with shipping and wharfage, including a shipping providore, oyster saloon, wine bar, shipping agent, and commission agent. In the evolution of The Rocks, the Phillip's Foote building is of some significance as the first building to be subject of major renovations following the Green Bans' halting of redevelopment plans for the area. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Phillip's Foote building and site is associated with a number of former owners and occupants of note, including Frederic Wright Unwin (solicitor, owner of site -1846), William Reynolds (blacksmith, lessee of site 1838-1859), William Yeoman, plumber and painter, owner/occupant -1868), Thomas Playfair (butcher, influential alderman in City of Sydney Council between 1875‚Äì1893, lessee of site 1869-1886). Between 1887 and 1920, the place was operated as an oyster saloon and later a wine bar by a succession of European immigrants from Dalmatia (present-day Croatia) and Italy, a history which is significant in reflecting aspects of migration to Australia from Europe. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Although substantially rebuilt in the mid-1970s, the Phillip's Foote building is of some aesthetic quality as a plain two storey shop with glazed, recessed shopfront typical of the 19th century Victorian Italianate. The Phillip's Foote building makes an important contribution to the streetscape of George Street, and is of significance in continuing the uniform character of the smaller scale retail shop buildings found in The Rocks. The Cook House makes an important contribution to the confined character of the Nurses Walk / Greenway Lane pedestrian thoroughfare as a terminating point in views to the north along Nurses Walk. Both the Cook House and Phillip's Foote are significant in defining the \\"walled\\" nature of Suez Canal, which, together with Nurses Walk and Greenway Lane, are highly significant as evocations of the colonial townscape of The Rocks. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As part of The Rocks area, 101 George Street is held in some esteem by individuals and groups who are interested in Sydney's history and heritage. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has some research potential of significance to reveal evidence of the previous occupation of the site from c1788, when the Assistant Surgeon's residence, later occupied by Francis Greenway, was built nearby. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The place possesses a degree of rarity as the first site to be the subject of heritage renovations/reconstructions in the 1970s, when the plans of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority to raze The Rocks for redevelopment were still in place. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The scale and streetscape character of the Phillip's Foote building is representative of early 19th commercial building in The Rocks as a plain two-storey shop with residence.

Studio and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It is the eleventh standalone entry to the Super Robot Wars series and the third installment of the \\"International Era\\" series, with the game's continued focus on the massive crossover between different mecha anime series released in Japan. Released for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, it was also released in Asia on March 20, 2019. Gameplay Super Robot Wars T follows the same basic structure as most other games in the Super Robot Wars franchise: before a stage begins, the character receives introductory dialogue between playable characters which leading to the scenario on the battlefield. To complete a scenario, the player must accomplish certain objectives. Some scenarios are longer, with some having multi-part missions or new objectives added as the story unfolds. On battlefield, the player and enemy take turns to order their units with commands such as moving, attacking, and casting \\"Spirit Commands\\", a set of magic-like spells unique to each pilot. Once the scenario is cleared, more dialogue is exchanged between characters before the player is taken to an intermission menu. Here, units can be upgraded or optional parts installed, characters' stats and skills can be changed or upgraded, and other maintenance actions can be performed before the continuing on with the game. Gameplay elements from previous games return, including the Skill Route and Skill Program function introduced in Super Robot Wars V, as well as the Tac Management system and Hard Mode settings as they appeared in Super Robot Wars X. New elements in the game is included in the form of the Support Command, which grants special commands through Supporters. Supporter Spirits Points, needed to use Supporter Commands, are shared between all Supporters characters. The game also uses the sub-order system, first introduced in 2nd Super Robot Wars Z. Like the previous games, Super Robot Wars T has paid downloadable content in the form of extra missions and items. Characters=VTX Union= ; : One of the game's main protagonists, he is the leader of the VTX Union's secret service's third division. Though he is a proud Salaryman, he is very proud of his job and has zero priorities on everything else. He also can be arrogant, laid back but wild at times. He is one of the pilots of the , the company's flagship mecha which focuses on long-ranged combat. If Sagiri is chosen as the main character, he ends up piloting the Gespenst. :Takeshi Kusao stated that he's a fan of the Super Robot Wars games since 1991, and his acting \\"reflects how Saizou has a lot of life experience and tries to show off to younguns.\\" He also compared Saizou to Crowe Burst from 2nd Super Robot Wars Z, yet both being different in many ways. ; : One of the game's main protagonists, she is also a member of VTX Union secret service's third division, serving as Saizo's superior. A formidable pilot in the battlefield, though beautiful, she has a very crude personality and has a drive to push herself to the limits just for the money. Like Saizo, she is also one of the pilots of the Tyranado. If Saizo is chosen as the main character, she ends up piloting the Gespenst. ; : Development The game was first announced during the \\"Nama SupaRobo Channel\\" livestream on November 19, 2018 alongside the upcoming mobile title Super Robot Wars DD. Like the previous two installments focusing on the crossover aspect, the game itself is themed around \\"Revenge\\" and similar to both titles, aimed more for newcomers of the series. In the title of the series, the \\"T\\" stands for \\"Terra\\". The game also marks its first ever release on the Nintendo Switch, following the decline of the PlayStation Vita. Like Super Robot Wars X, it only has few new entries to the game as well as returning entries to the series. Mobile Fighter G Gundam and Gun Sword both return in the franchise after their last respective game debuts while Mazinger Z: Infinity properly debuted in the game after its one-time event debut in Super Robot Wars X-Œ©. For the debuting series, Magic Knight Rayearth becomes the second Sh≈çjo anime series after Aikatsu! to debut in the series while Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX marks as the second Space Opera series to debut in the franchise.

Music The game's opening and ending themes are performed by Anison group JAM Project, with the single \\"Tread on the Tiger's Tail / RESET\\" officially released on April 24, 2019. Release The game was released on both the PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch in Japan and Asian territories on March 20, 2019. Pre-orders of both versions of the game included a special downloadable code for two special scenarios and a guest unit, the Gespenst. Also, similar to V and X, a Premium Anime Song & Sound Edition was released on the same date. On May 24, a new difficulty mode called \\"Super Expert Mode\\" was added to the game, which increased enemy unit customization levels even further and disallows retrying the stage when trying to achieve SR points. It also allowed further upgrades for the player's units and pilots, such as an additional Ace rank, new skill levels, an increased cap on pilot levels and stats, and an increased cap on unit upgrade ranks. Reception Famitsu gave Super Robot Wars T an 8 out of 10, noting that while there was little in the way of new gameplay systems and mechanics, the streamlining of certain customization options, such as pilot skill acquisition, came as a welcome change. They also praised the new Supporter system, which, while \\"simple\\", allowed non-combat characters from included to participate in battles. They also praised the quality of the new battle animations and the uniqueness of the lineup that the new series brought, such as Magic Knight Rayearth and Cowboy Bebop. Destructoid praised the game for its appeal to newcomers; they called its roster \\"excellent\\" with \\"broad appeal\\", and said it had the best story in the translated trio. Other strong points were most of the new sprites and animations, as well as the new Supporter system. However, they thought the game \\"stumbles appealing to fans of previous games\\", noting that asset reuse, while ordinary for the Super Robot Wars series, has led to inconsistent animation quality even within a single unit's attacks. They also were unhappy with issues with game balance, particularly with regards to Expert mode, which functionally makes certain bonus objectives easier to meet.

The monastery was founded om 978 by Unisco Godins, wife of Aboazar Lovesendes, first lord of Maia and ancestor of this family. On 23 November 1097, count Henrique and his wife Teresa donated land, defining the boundaries, and other properties to Soeiro Mendes da Maia, a descendant of Unisco and Abunazar. Soeiro, in turn, on 23 March 1098 donated these properties to the Abbot of the monastery, Gaudemiro, making the monastery one of the richest and relevant in the country. It was awarded Bulls of protection by the Popes Innocent III and Honorius III. The original monastic church was built in 978. It was replaced by another one in 1090, which, in turn, was replaced by another one built in the early 14th century with the funds donated for its construction by Martim Gil de Riba de Vizela, Count of Barcelos. From this church there are some archaeological remains. On 15 October 1385, and 6, 7 August of 1409 the monastery was visited by King John I of Portugal. The present church was built in 1659‚Äì79, with a project by Br. Jo√£o Turriano, son of a Milanese architect, Leonardo Turriano. It has a processional Latin cross and a single nave. The facade has three niches in which are housed the sculptures of Santo Tirso in the center, flanked by S. Bento and Santa Escol√°stica. In the tympanum is inscribed the date of 1679 that, hypothetically, represents the term of the construction of the church. The monastery owned lands and other assets that had been donated by members of the nobility, particularly by the Maias, the founding family, until the 19th century, when im 1834 the State expropriated the properties of the religious orders and closed the monasteries. On 11 May of that year, 46 days after the removal of the monks of S. Bento, the Interim Municipal Commission of the future municipality of Santo Tirso was taken over, which would be based in one of the monastery buildings.

It was built during 1856. It is also known as Joe Bananas (current) and Ariel Bookshop (former). The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002. the ground-floor tenant was Joe Bananas, an Australian fashion label.  History  The first building - with its associated garden - to be constructed on the western side of the cove in the vicinity of the present 103 George Street site was the hospital. Although the hospital was originally situated just north of the future Argyle St, it was moved within a year to an area just south of where Argyle Street would develop. The site, now referred to as 103 George Street, occupies part of that land occupied by the original military hospital. These early medical facilities were replaced in 1790 by a portable hospital which was brought out to the colony with the Second Fleet. On the corner of George and Argyle St, stood a building that was occupied by the Assistant Surgeon until 1814 and later, from 1814 until 1836, by Francis Greenway. \\"Like so many other aspects of his life, Francis Greenway's occupancy of this house was contentious. Greenway claimed that the land had been given to him by Governor Macquarie, but no real proof could be found in government records. A document produced by Greenway may have been a forgery. He had been tempted to such a crime once before when hard pressed in his business affairs. This led to his transportation. Greenway was evicted, but was then allowed to stay on in the building, to become more and more of an embarrassment to government. Eventually he left to join his family in the Hunter Valley, where he died.\\"Ellis, 1953, revised edition, p. 35. The subject site was adjacent to the residence and site to which Francis Greenway laid claim. On the site now known as 103 George St, there appears, at that time to be three structures. By the time the site was subdivided by Elizabeth Broughton (1841), only one of the buildings remained, or at least only one was shown on the subdivision plan. Elizabeth (or Eliza), or her husband William Broughton, had, prior to the official register of the grant, built a shop there between 1831 and 1832, this shop was called McHealy's China Shop. Broughton's claim to the land is noted on Robert Russell's survey map of 1834 and Elizabeth Charlotte Broughton was legally confirmed as owner of the site on 30 April 1840, by Town Grant 235. John Richards, a draper in the Town of Sydney, purchased the property in November 1842. Maurice Reynolds (aka Morris) is recorded as the owner between 1849 and 1852. The 1851 Municipal Rate Books for Gipps ward indicated that the one-storey timber building was being used as a smiths shop. Richards sold the property to James O'Neill, who erected the three-storey structure between 1855 and 1856. In 1871, Thomas Playfair was using the new premises at 103 George St, constructed , as a butcher's shop. He became the legal owner in 1882. On his death in 1893, the property passed to Thomas' son, Edmund Playfair. Edmund remained the property's owner until 1902, when it was resumed by the Government of New South Wales. Thomas Playfair joined the British Royal Navy at the age of 12 in 1845, and served on a number of ships including Hecla, Tyne, Rattler, Hecate, Asia, Swift, Brisk, and Pelorus, on which ship he travelled to Melbourne as Wardroom Steward, arriving on 30 September 1859. Here he was voluntarily discharged, and almost immediately made his way to Sydney, arriving there on SS London on 7 October 1859. In 1860, Thomas formed a partnership with Edmund John Bailey, a carcass butcher, trading as Bailey and Co. In the same year, he married Ellen Matheson, a younger sister of Bailey's wife Margaret. In 1860, the partnership purchased the Shipping Butcher business from George Read at 107 George Street, Sydney and traded as Bailey and Playfair. After Bailey's death in 1862, it appears that his wife Margaret sold his interests in this business and the shops at South Head Road and Crown Street to Thomas Playfair. After the death of Ellen Matheson, Thomas married her half sister, Georgina, in 1867. The property was originally leased to Thomas, but at sometime prior to 1882, he purchased it and the business remained there until the early 1900s except for a period from , when he leased it to other interests while he rented 101 George Street, across the Suez Canal, to carry on his business until he returned to 103 in 1885. The names Bailey and Playfair continued to be linked in the business until . Thomas must have had great respect for Bailey, as he named his second son Edmund John Bailey Playfair. In 1875, Thomas was elected as an Alderman for the Sydney City Council for Gipps Ward, one of the eight wards into which Sydney was divided at the time, and which included the George Street North and The Rocks area. He served continuously for 18 years until his death in 1893. He was elected Mayor of Sydney in 1885. Thomas Playfair was also responsible for the establishment of the Homebush saleyards. After Playfair's death in 1893, his son, Edmund, continued to run the family business at least until 1907. Following this period, there was a succession of tenants using the building for a variety of retail purposes until the occupation by F. R. Edwards. Records found on the premises indicated that the Edwards family had been long term tenants, manufacturing and selling shoes and clothing. Their business was called \\"Edwards Bespoke Shoemakers, Late of London\\" at the time of establishment in 1938. The name was changed during the 1950s to \\"Edwards Outfitters\\", then, during the 1970s to \\"Edwards Suit, Shoe and Trouser Cave\\", and finally, to \\"Edwards Rocks Rig\\". the tenants were Ariel Bookshop (103 George Street, and first and second levels, rear building on Harrington Street); Australian World Trading Pty Ltd., on Levels 1 and 2 above 103 George Street, and Sydney Cove Jewellery on the Ground Floor Level of the rear building fronting Harrington Street.Graham Brooks and Associates Pty Ltd, 2005 the ground-floor tenant was Joe Bananas, an Australian fashion label.  Description  No 103 George Street is a fine three storey building in the Victorian Regency style. Its proportions are pleasing with a formal symmetry in line with that of the Victorian Regency architecture in Britain which was transported to Australia and adapted by the early European settlers. It was built in 1856 of stuccoed brick with articulated quoins and finely detailed stone architraves and cornices to first and second floors. The window openings are larger than those provided in facades of similar contemporary buildings, e.g. 105 George Street. The use of decoratively moulded string courses with supporting scrolled brackets adds a touch of lightness and relief to the fa√ßade. The distinctive embellished parapet top to the front of the building is a detail that has become relatively rare. The shopfront is not original.National Trust, 1977.Riggs, 1998.

Heritage listing  As at 26 June 2002, the Ariel Bookshop and residence and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building(s) are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State heritage significance in its own right. The building known as 103 George Street, The Rocks, is of cultural significance due to early associations with the first Hospital site, the early development of The Rocks precinct, the carrying out of mercantile-related businesses in the area, with cultural diversity of the various owners and tenants, and its association with a leading personality of the late 19th Century, Thomas Playfair. The site is also significant for its close physical proximity to the home of Francis Greenway, who, for some 20 years, lived at, or near, the corner of Argyle and George Streets in the former Assistant Surgeon's residence. The site, and the historical records associated with it, provides evidence of the evolution of the Colony's system of land title registration, of the development of architectural style, and the evolution of building techniques in Sydney from the middle to the late 19th Century. It retains significant parts of its original fabric and contributes texture and form to the unique townscape of The Rocks. It provides evidence of the changing demands and expectations of the community by adaptation of the building(s) to accommodate various commercial and residential uses. It has the ability to continue as a reference to the past for both present and future generations as it can continue to used sympathetically, possibly almost identically, to its initial form of use. The structure is substantially intact and has a high archaeological potential to reveal evidence about former inhabitants of the site. Shop and Residence - Ariel Bookshop was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The building's historical significance derives from its development from the early commercial era of this city, its continual use as a retail and residential premises. The site is historically significant as a site continuously occupied by Europeans since 1788, with the First Fleet, as the site of the house of the Assistant Surgeon from c1788 and with the first colonial architect, Francis Greenway, who lived in a house on the site between 1815 and . The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Thomas Playfair, and his family, are strongly associated with the site through his meat processing, export and butchering business. Playfair was also a Member of the NSW Legislative Assembly and Mayor of Sydney. The site itself has strong associations with Francis Greenway, who lived close by, at the corner of Argyle and George Streets, from 1814 to 1835. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The building represents a commercial building typical of its type in this context. Its proportions are pleasing with a formal symmetry typical of the Victorian Regency architecture in Britain which was transported to this country and adapted by the early European settlers. The building is centrally located within the George (High) Street precinct and contributes to the heritage and townscape significance. 103 George Street and the surrounding buildings were the earliest commercial development on The Rocks area and established the urban/commercial streetscape of George Street. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building's social significance derives from its links with and support function associated with the development of the society in which it has sat for 150 years. Built as a store in what would have been the most important merchandising precinct in the country, its relevance grew as its use evolved to not only link its function to serve customers in general, but to more closely relate to the important servicing of the shipping industry which had developed into an essential part of the social and commercial life of the city. Its almost continuous use as a residence, as an adjunct to its retail function, derives from the early social pattern and is one of the few buildings in the area that has retained this commercial/residential tradition to the present day. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building's scientific significance derives from the ability of its fabric to demonstrate methods of building construction contemporary with the times and the efficacy of these methods and materials to withstand a long period of wear due to usage, weathering and attack by pathological agents - mainly, in this case, termites. The builders of this period were undoubtedly schooled in Britain and skilled in methods appropriate to conditions and materials found in their homeland. The site and building have the ability to reveal evidence of pre-European culture, of its use as a garden site associated with the hospital, and of earlier construction. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. In its almost continuous use as a residence, as an adjunct to its retail function, the site is a rare example of the early social patterning. It is one of the few buildings in the area that has retained this commercial / residential tradition to the present day. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The buildings on the site are representative of what was at the time, the most important merchandising precinct in the country. The shop premises, and the relevance of the place, grew as its use evolved to not only link its function to serve customers in general, but to more closely relate to the servicing of the shipping industry which had developed into an essential part of the social and commercial life of the city.

He is best known for joining George Spurre to raid Spanish Campeche. History After England withdrew from the Franco-Dutch War in 1674, Neville accepted a French privateering commission to sail against Spain. Jamaican Governor John Vaughan tried to recall English privateers to maintain England's neutrality in the continuing war but had little success. In 1675 he accused legendary buccaneer Henry Morgan ‚Äì now pardoned, and promoted to become Vaughan's own Deputy Governor ‚Äì of writing to Neville and other privateers, promising them pardons and freedom. Morgan wrote, ‚Äúand to all others acting under French Commissions as well English as French ‚Ä¶ they are welcome to this island and shall have all the privileges they ever had and Port Royal is free to them.‚Äù Neville continued operating under his French commission, partnering with George Spurre in 1678 to sack Campeche. After capturing a few ships off Cuba that April and recruiting more men, they sailed to Campeche in July and anchored offshore at night. Neville took his sloop into the harbor to spy on Spanish defenses; reporting back to Spurre that the city was ripe for conquest, they attacked by stealth early the next morning. The defenders were caught unawares and the pirates quickly captured the town, looting it for two days and taking three Spanish ships with them before withdrawing. Future Governor William Beeston noted their return to Jamaica in October 1678, where they were pardoned for their privateering and free to spend their booty. Spanish Provincial Governor Antonio de Layseca y Alvarado was removed from office for failing to defend Campeche, though he was later reinstated. In retaliation he ordered Spanish forces (privateer and pirate Juan Corso among them) to capture or drive off English logwood cutters in his territory. An ‚ÄúEdward Neville‚Äù was still living on Jamaica as of 1698, where he was employed as a judge; it is unknown if this was the buccaneer Neville, though other ex-pirates such as Morgan, George Dew, and Josiah Burgess retired from piracy to serve in similar capacities.

The species lives off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand, in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, in depths of . It has a black or dark brown colored body; males have a total length of . The species is closely related to the abyssal ghostshark. Although it is sometimes caught as a bycatch, it does not have any major threats and is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  Taxonomy and etymology  The black ghostshark was described by Dominique A. Didier in 2008. It is one of 23 species in the genus Hydrolagus. Its genus name, Hydrolagus, comes from the Greek words hydro, which means \\"water\\" and lagos, which means \\"hare\\". The specific name, homonycteris, is composed of the word homo, the Latin word for man, and nycteris, the word for bat. Its name was taken after Thomas A. Griffiths, a professor at Illinois Wesleyan University, whose students called him \\"bat man\\".  Description  The black ghostshark can grow up to in body length, with a maximum total length of for males. Its body is dark in color, typically black or a dark shade of brown. Its eyes are large and its snout is slightly pointed. Its dorsal spine is large and it has round pelvic fins. Its claspers have areas of bristles on them and are somewhat short and thin. Its appearance is similar to that of the abyssal ghostshark, another species of chimaera to which it is closely related; however, the black ghostshark's dorsal spine is longer than that of the abyssal ghostshark and its claspers are darker and smaller.  Distribution and habitat  The black ghostshark lives in the southwestern Pacific Ocean off the coasts of south-eastern Australia, from Portland, Victoria, to Ulladulla, New South Wales, covering the states of New South Wales, Tasmania, and Victoria. The species also occurs in New Zealand from the West Norfolk Ridge to the Campbell Plateau. In Australia, it lives in waters deep, while it lives at slightly shallower depths in New Zealand, at . The species is found at the continental slope and seamounts.  Threats and conservation  Throughout its New Zealand range, the black ghostshark is sometimes caught as a bycatch; a study showed the number of specimens caught gradually increasing from 1990 to 2010. It is generally caught from trawls and fisheries, which operate in deeper waters in New Zealand. It is also recorded to be caught intentionally in the country, although what the species can be used for there is unknown. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the black ghostshark as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifier \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. In Australia, the species is also caught as a bycatch, but infrequently. South Tasman Rise Fishery, which was previously a threat to the species, closed in 2007, making the species less vulnerable in the Australian area. The species is safe to eat and has good-quality flesh. At the current time, it does not have any major threats, so no conservation actions are taking place for the species and it is listed as least concern by the IUCN.

Sam avoids the attack and Michelle accidentally impales her sister, before electrocuting herself when the drill punctures wiring in a wall. Sam hears cries for help from a bedroom, and she enters to find Judi Ross, the daughter of coven leader Danica, hogtied on the bed. Danica had originally intended Judi to be the coven's virginal sacrifice, but after discovering that Judi had had sex to avoid this fate, Danica ordered Judi to be killed. Sam frees Judi and calls 911, but the call redirects to the coven, so the girls again flee. Danica next tries to capture Sam by creating a \\"haxan cloak\\" creature from her dead husband's heart, but Sam escapes the creature with Judi's help. Gypsy questions Danica's leadership, and when the rest of the coven sides with Gypsy, Danica agrees to let Gypsy conduct a ritual to curse and kill Judi from afar. However, Judi, who is versed in witchcraft, manages with Sam's help to ward off the curse. An irate Gypsy confronts Danica about teaching her daughter the protection magic that allowed her to survive. Another coven member suddenly plunges a spike into Danica's head, apparently killing her. However, after the coven leaves in search of Sam, Danica resurrects herself. Using knowledge gained from reading the entrails of a man she murders, Danica tracks down and captures Sam and Judi. Sam and Judi awaken tied to an altar in Danica's backyard, surrounded by the coven. Danica, triumphant and back in control of the coven, uses a spell to drown Gypsy. As she falls dead, Gypsy inadvertently breaks the protective circle of salt laid to prevent the ritual from being disturbed. The summoning begins, and Sam is supernaturally impregnated by Baphomet. An enraged Sam breaks free from her bonds and holds a knife to her now-pregnant belly, demanding Judi be released. Instead, Danica slashes Judi's throat and kills her. Despondent, Sam suddenly goes into labor; to calm herself she repeats a \\"two fuzzy bunnies\\" mantra, and then she gives birth to two fuzzy bunnies (rather than Baphomet as intended) to the shock of the coven. Sam suddenly finds the yard empty of all coven members. A demon named Samaziel manifests in front of Sam in the guise of a little girl. Samaziel explains that it ranks higher than Baphomet among Hell's demons and is angry that the coven did not worship it. Because the protective line of salt had been disturbed by Gypsy's death, Samaziel was able to enter and wreak havoc on the ritual. Sam convinces Samaziel to spare her, and as Sam flees, the yard is again populated with the coven. Danica is decapitated as Samaziel laughs. Coven members begin choking to death. Sam collects one of the bunnies and escapes on her Vespa as Samaziel waves goodbye. Sam returns to the pizzeria, where she tells her boss she is going to Australia and leaves with her bunny, now named Judi Junior.

Originally built in 1762 to protect Cresmina beach from landings, it was transferred to private ownership in 1889. As of 2018 it was in a ruined condition. History During the so-called Fantastic War (1762-1763) between Portugal and Spain and the simultaneous Seven Years‚Äô War that involved most European powers, three support batteries were built under the guidance of the Count of Schaumburg-Lippe on the 2 kilometer stretch of coastline covering Cresmina Beach and Guincho Beach on the west coast of Portugal, north of the River Tagus estuary. Their main objective was to provide quarters for small garrisons that could hinder the landing of Franco- Spanish forces via the beaches, where troops could be easily landed. This would allow time for the alarm to be raised to enable critical points in the defence of Lisbon, 30km away, to be reinforced. The Cresmina battery was the most southerly of the three batteries and, in addition to protecting the beaches, also crossed fire with the Fort of S√£o Br√°s de Sanxete. Rebuilding was carried out in 1793. The fort was not used during the Peninsular War (1807-1814), and it was gradually abandoned, being deactivated in the early 1820s. During the Portuguese Civil War (1828-1834), Miguel I of Portugal ordered its restoration and expansion, and this was carried out between 1830 and 1832. However, on July 24, 1833, it was disarmed and abandoned when the army of Miguel I withdrew, and later, after the civil war, it fell into ruins. In 1850 funds were made available for its repair, but nothing was done. By 1854 the fort was in an advanced state of ruin. Cresmina fort was put up for auction in 1895. Ownership was subsequently transferred several times and in 1908 it was purchased by Ant√≥nio Augusto Carvalho Monteiro and inherited by his descendants on his death. Although the structure still remains, it presents obvious signs of ruin.

Personal life  Roberts was a son to William and Jane Roberts of Llwyn'rhudol. He was baptized at Llwyn'rhudol Uchaf in the parish of Aber-erch near Pwllheli, Caernarvonshire. He moved from Wales to London before he reached the age of 14, and was probably apprenticed to a goldsmith. In 1791, Roberts married Mary, the daughter of a prosperous Warwickshire Quaker family. Their first child, Hannah, was born in October the same year. They had five daughters and a son and lived near the city of London at Aldgate, Clerkenwell. Mary died in March 1829 and was buried on 5 April in Bunhill Fields. Roberts became a London goldsmith through Mary's family. In 1802, Roberts practiced at the firm of Weatherby and Roberts, goldsmiths and then worked at the firm of Thomas and R. J. Roberts in 1805. Thomas Roberts was an active member of Gwyneddigion, a society of Welsh patriots founded in London in 1770 as a Welsh-language debating society that discussed the controversial issues of radical London politics at a time of insecurity and censorship.  Career  The society's purpose was the proclamation of Freedom within Society. In 1798, Roberts published the book Ctvyn yn erbyn Gorthrymder (A Complaint Against Oppression). The radical pamphlet became a Welsh Enlightenment with the purpose of developing the Welsh language for learning and furthering sentiments of cultural distinctiveness to support Welsh Nationalism in the 19th century. The pamphlets used English to brand expressions and people as hostile to Wales and the Welsh language. In 1827, Roberts published an English and Welsh Vocabulary and a pocket book of Welsh phrases with their English equivalents. To ensure that Wales benefited from many of the works previously available in English, Roberts published a Welsh version of Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard in 1839. He then published Welsh versions of English devotional materials. Known for his critical knowledge of his native tongue, Roberts managed the publication of the Welsh edition of the Book of common prayer, while correcting some of the inaccuracies of earlier editions. Roberts joined in challenging the clerical privilege enjoyed by the Established church and wrote against the civic inequalities experienced by the dissenters of Methodism in 18th-19th century Wales. Thomas picked up on the 'Apostles of Liberty' Richard Price and Joseph Priestley's demands for liberty of conscience as well as Thomas Paine's condemnation of 'priestcraft' as a pillar of corruption. His writings attacked tithing and the establishment of churches by a state. Roberts' pamphlets were satirized by Methodist Poet Evan Pritchard, who stated that Roberts had sent him a book from London that contained a complaint against the Methodist Bishops. Although Pritchard stated that he did not have much to say against Roberts, he suggested that he disliked Roberts' accusations. Although Roberts was not a supporter of the Methodists, he spoke in their defense. His pseudonymous writing as Arvonius spoke against the libelous anti-Methodism of a fellow London-Welshman, Anglican Edward Charles. His defence was inspired by a Quaker dislike of the established church and a radical distaste for ‚Äòold corruption‚Äô.  Later life  Roberts lost much of his wealth towards the end of his life. He lived on a pension from the Goldsmiths' company. Roberts died on 24 May 1841 at the home of his sole surviving daughter, Keturah. He was buried with Mary in Bunhill Fields on 30 May.

It was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon and built from 1906 to 1908. It is also known as Coroner's Court (former) - Shops & offices, Coroners Court / City Morgue (at rear, demolished) and shops and offices. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  When the colony's dockyard was moved to the area in 1797, this was a prominent site stretching from approximately the site of the MCA to Campbell's Cove. The northern end, including the subject site, of the land was set aside for the residence and garden of the Master Boat Builder, Thomas Moore. This building was later converted to the Naval Office, the headquarters for the imposition of Customs until it was transferred to a new Customs House (now the east store of the Argyle Stores) in 1827. The Naval Office was demolished in 1833. By 1832, the land had been divided in two by a path descending to the water, this route was very steep and was originally known as the \\"Go Down\\" by the residents of The Rocks. The eventual street became Bethel Street, named after the Bethel Union, founders of the Mariner's Church. In June 1853 the third coroner for Sydney, Ryan Brenan, suggested to the Colonial Secretary that a Dead House or Morgue be built on crown land near Cadman's Cottage. The Colonial Secretary asked Edmund Blacket, the Colonial Architect to prepare plans and estimates for the building. Blackett disagreed with the siting, and suggested that it would be better 'located on the new landing place against the wall of the Campbell's Wharf'. The Colonial Secretary was dubious about the suggestion, as the Campbell residence was nearby and the family may object to having such a building so close. Blackett resigned in 1854 to work on the University of Sydney and it is unsure if he or his successor William Weaver prepared the plans for the building. It appears the building was dogged by problems. Weaver managed to incur the Governor's displeasure over irregularities arising out of the completion of the Dead House. In trying to resolve the problems, Weaver instructed further work to be done, which the Colonial Secretary's office refused to pay for, leading to his resignation. No plans remain for the building but a specification exists for the work. It was to be a brick building on stone foundations and floors with a slate roof. In 1856 it was requested that the glazed windows be \\"obscured\\", presumably as they allowed the public to see the morbid contents. The problems of keeping such a building in a sanitary condition in the Sydney climate proved difficult. In 1856 it was reported to have been in a \\"filthy state\\" in the same memorandum requesting the obscuring of the windows. The Coroner in 1862, John S. Parker reported to the Colonial Secretary that the ventilation was insufficient, \\"at the request of thirteen respectable citizens who composed the jury that had to view the body of a sailor who had been taken out of the harbour in a state of decomposition and had to be kept there two days\\". Three more ventilators were added and this may been the beginning to the tradition of holding the Coroner's Court proceedings in the Observer Hotel across the road. Despite its deficiencies, the building appears to have been used continuously as a morgue for more than fifty years. By 1863, the land had been reserved for a new Morgue which was not built until 1906‚Äì07, the reason for the delay is not yet known. From 1865 the Court of the Coroner was located at Chancery Square, near Hyde Park Barracks. Here the jury sat on inquests and witnesses appeared in a courtroom which was described as \\"unfitted for almost any public purpose\\". Inquests were frequently adjourned because of this and some were transferred to the nearby Riley's Hotel. Officially, the Coroner's Court remained at the Hyde Park Barracks site until the construction of the Court and Morgue in The Rocks. The Morgue was designed and completed before the Court. Before its construction, several structures on the site had to be demolished, these included the old Dead House, a caretakers cottage, and a set of stairs. Construction of the Coroners Court followed in 1907‚Äì08. In the process Bethel Street, was reduced to a narrow lane running along the wall of the Mariners' Church. Construction of the two buildings also involved the loss of a large tree which earlier photographs show next to the Sailor's Home. It may also have led to an interesting historical discovery. In 1920 Charles Bertie recorded that \\"some 30 years ago\\" a paving slab discovered in Bethel Street turned out to be the tombstone of a sailor on the \\"Sirius\\" of the First Fleet. The memorial was to George Groves, a boatswain's yeoman. The Morgue provided a receiving room for bodies, a central mortuary with seven tables, a post mortem room and a laboratory. The Court was constructed on the higher part of the site, and at the rear of the building was a flight of stairs connecting it to the Morgue below. From George Street the Court was entered through a covered arcade, the ground floor held the Courtroom, separate room for male and female witnesses, offices for the Coroner and clerks and a jury room. Above the offices was a residence. Government Architect Vernon, was in charge of the design of both the Morgue and the Coroner's Court projects. The court building demonstrates Vernon's concern and ability to design for the particular use and climate. The exterior has a domestic approachable appearance compared to the authoritarian appearance of earlier designs for similar buildings, however the interior retained the pre-eminence of the Coroners position. Several alterations were in 1911 including the addition of a washroom, and the verandah at the rear was enclosed to provide more accommodation. In 1935 the Coroner's Court was the scene of an inquest into a bizarre death which has become famous throughout Australia. It concerned the alleged murder of James Smith, and became known as \\"the Shark Arm Murder\\". On 17 April 1935 a fisherman caught a large shark which he took to the aquarium then located at Coogee. A few days later the shark became sick and regurgitated a large amount of undigested matter, including a human arm with a tattoo attached to a length of rope. The arm was identified by the tattoo as belonging to James Smith. The inquest into his death by the Coroner was challenged in the Supreme Court by arguing that an arm did not constitute a body. This led to calls for the Coroner's Act to be altered. In 1936 representations were being made that the Morgue was poorly sited. In December the Captain of the P&O; Strathaird observed that the passengers could clearly see into the post-mortem room where a body was visible. Residents around the vicinity of the Morgue, including the Superintendent of the Sailor's Home also complained about the sights and smells from the building. In 1937 the Commissioner of Police organised a conference discussing building a new morgue and the requirements needed. In 1945 the Morgue was inspected by a committee who were less than impressed by its siting and accommodation and they also recorded that at times the stench emanating from the building was offensive. Following this report, required alterations were finally made and the building was enlarged. Meanwhile, the Coroner was concerned about the state of the Court and he submitted a list of urgent repairs in 1948, but there is no record of any work being carried out. The buildings were altered twice more, in 1956 and the final alteration in 1967. The Court and Morgue underwent several alterations and additions in the period to 1971, when the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA) resolved to demolish the Morgue and to convert the site to a bus and car park. The Morgue and Coroners Court moved to a new building in Glebe late 1971. The Morgue was demolished in 1972 after green bans and protests by local residents. In the same year the Court building was converted by SCRA to an exhibition space and offices, with a further later conversion to a Visitors Centre in 1973.PWD 1991: 5-6 &11-26 The building was converted for use as a shop after the opening of the new Visitors' Centre in the Sailors Home in 1995. Since that time it has housed an antique shop and is currently used as a craft gallery. Archaeology Notes: The \\"Dead House\\" stood here from at least the 1830s. A laneway, Bethel Lane, was created in 1861 and cut diagonally from south at George Street to north at Circular Quay West. In 1871 a headstone of 1788 was discovered here opening debate that a cemetery may have been located nearby. The new morgue and coroners court were built in 1907.  Description  The Coroner's Court is designed in the Federation Free Style manner typical of many of the buildings credited to its designer, W. L. Vernon. The style of the building is restrained, relying on massing and modelling rather than architectural detail for decoration. The building is essentially composed of two structures: *A single storey section, containing courtroom with associated witness rooms, arcade at front and verandah at rear; and *A two-storey section, containing offices and residence with attic bedrooms. The interior layout on the George Street level (level 3) was designed around a centrally placed courtroom with a hallway on two sides and a verandah and arcade on the other two sides. The rest of level 3 is taken up by the two witness rooms to the south and the three offices to the north. A stairway in the north hall leads up to the original residential parts of the building on level 4, which replicates the floor below, and level 5, which contains a further two rooms. Additional rooms have been created on level 2, under the verandah.PWD 1991:27-28 Style: Federation Free Style; Storeys: Five; Facade: Brickwork/stonework; Side Rear Walls: Brick; Internal Walls: Painted brick/plastered; Roof Cladding: Slate with lead ridge capping and copper valleys; Stairs: Timber. = Condition = Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Bedrock visible, with floors terraced into hill slope, and below George Street level. Basements. Rear of site level with Circular Quay West. Visible bedrock indicates that the original surface has been cut into. The evaluation of the site depends on the dating of the quarrying, as early levelling will allow the subsequent build-up of archaeological deposits. Foundations of the second morgue (), demolished in the 1970s, are present in the vacant site at the rear. It is possible that the foundations also exist for the earlier morgue and the original alignment of Bethel Street as it joins George Street. Archaeology partly disturbed. It is possible the original alignment of Bethel Street may exist under part of the building. = Modifications and dates = *1907‚Äì1908 (Coroners Court); 1906‚Äì1907 (City Morgue) *1911: Alterations, including the addition of a washroom, were made to the residential quarters of the Coroner's Court, and the verandah at the rear of the Court was filled in to provide additional accommodation. These alterations were constructed according to plans signed by Vernon, as Government Architect and E. L. Drew, Assistant Architect. *1946 : Government Architect's plans show that the Morgue was to be enlarged by demolishing the 1907 wall facing the Quay and extending the building to the boundary. This work was carried out in 1947-48. Other minor changes were undertaken to about 1967. *1972: Demolition of the Morgue by SCRA and conversion of the court building to an exhibition space and offices, including removal of the original courtroom fittings and furnishings. *1973: Further alterations were made to adapt the building for use as a Visitors Centre.PWD 1991: 22-26 The building has since been used as an antique store and craft gallery, minor modifications for the fitout of the shops has been carried out.  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, the former Coroner's Court, now a pair of shops and offices, and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Coroner's Court and its site are significant for the following reasons: It is the earliest surviving purpose-built Coroner's Court in NSW (and the only pre-1970 Coroner's Court), and as such has a unique ability to demonstrate through its external appearance and internal layout and fabric the history of the Coroner's office and of Coronial inquests. The surviving of the building provides the only remaining evidence of the site's association with early colonial methods of dealing with the investigation of unexplained or sudden deaths, over a continuous period from 1854 to 1971. It is a representative example of the public architecture of Walter Liberty Vernon, NSW Government Architect from 1890 to 1911, in its use of an unpretentious, almost domestic design invoking the truth-to-materials aesthetics of William Morris and the arts and crafts movement, and using picturesque elements and a dramatic roof line with restrained use of ornamentation. In conjunction with the other structures of similar date near that location (the Rawson Institute, Hickson Road and the Observer Hotel) it provides evidence of the new buildings constructed in the Rocks area after the area was taken over by the Sydney Harbour Trust. The topography of the site preserves an ability to demonstrate the steep descent from George Street north to the water which shaped the early development of the western side of Sydney Cove. The building has acted an important showcase for the work of the former Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, and the Sydney Cove Authority, and its presentation of a public face and as a first point of visitor contact. Its design makes a major contribution to the streetscape of George Street and to a lesser extent to Circular Quay West in its form, materials and scale. The site is of archaeological significance in its ability to demonstrate, through the in-situ archaeological remains, the use and history of the site especially in relation to the previous morgue building.Graham Brooks & Associates Pty Ltd. 2004 High Significance Fabric: In general, the Court building as originally constructed, together with alterations and additions to 1911 (i.e. the design and the alterations carried out under Vernon); all exterior brickwork and stonework inc. openings; roof structure, slate cladding, and terracotta chimney pots; all original and early joinery inc. jambs, doors, architraves, windows, sills, staircases and panelling (more see CP).

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site is associated with several Colonial Architects, including Blackett, Weaver, and Barnett and the later building with Government Architect WL Vernon. The site has associations with the Colonial and later Government Coroners from 1854 until 1971. It also has association with some of NSW's most notorious cases, including the \\"Shark Arm Murder\\" and the Bogle‚ÄìChandler case. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site holds social significance because of the former function as a Morgue extending back to 1854 and a Coroner's Court to 1906. It is the site for investigation into deaths by other than natural causes, including some of the most notorious cases in Australian History. The history of the site highlights some of the problems encountered in the history of dealing with death, including advances in forensics, problems of sanitation and the handling of bodies. The site holds high social value as an archaeological site which may contain physical evidence related to events in Australia's history. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has significant research potential as an archaeological resource which can inform about early configurations of the earlier structures on site. Foundations of the second morgue (), demolished in the 1970s, are present in the vacant site at the rear. It is possible that the foundations also exist for the earlier morgue and associated buildings and the original alignment of Bethel Street. The site also contains research potential as it is the earliest surviving purpose-built Coroner's Court in NSW (and the only pre-1970 Coroner's Court), and as such has a unique ability to demonstrate through its external appearance and internal layout and fabric the history of the Coroner's office and of Coronial inquests. The surviving of the building provides the only remaining evidence of the site's association with early colonial methods of dealing with the investigation of unexplained or sudden deaths, over a continuous period from 1854 to 1971. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site is rare because it is the earliest surviving purpose- built Coroner's Court in NSW (and the only pre-1970 Coroner's Court), and as such has a unique ability to demonstrate through its external appearance and internal layout and fabric the history of the Coroner's office and of Coronial inquests.

It is funded by the Department of Higher Education and Training. The program also manages bursaries such as the Funza Lushaka Teacher Bursary (for students pursuing a teaching qualification), DHET Disability Bursary and other bursaries from the Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs). History The National Student Financial Aid Scheme was established in 1996, replacing the Tertiary Education Fund of South Africa (TEFSA) in 1999. The TEFSA program was a non-profit company which managed and administered NSFAS since its establishment until 2000. In 1999, TEFSA was converted into a statutory body called NSFAS. The scheme is supported by over R30 billion () in funding from the Department of Higher Education and Training, and local and international donations. The bursaries cover the tuition fees, accommodation, and food and travel allowances for \\"full time\\" students, and only tuition fees for \\"part time\\" students. In 2019, , NSFAS had received 365,922 applications for financial aid in 2020, compared to the 278,738 applications it had received the year prior. In 2019, Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology Dr Blade Nzimande stated that the government had allocated nearly R80 billion for NSFAS over the next three years.

The loan repayment began once the student had found employment and was earning R80,000 or more annually. If the student was unemployed, they did not have to make repayments until they were employed. If the student left university or college, a case where they did not complete their qualification, the loan would still have to be repaid. , all accrued \\"loans\\" from NSFAS prior to 2018 must still be paid back. = Free subsidised higher education (post-2018) = On 16 December 2017, former President Jacob Zuma announced that \\"fully subsidised free higher education and training for poor and working class South African students\\" would be phased in by the South African government over a period of five years.

Canadian Yachting was published by Maclean-Hunter from December 1978 (V.3 no.12) up to 'Summer' 1990 (V.16 no.4, with an erroneous label suggesting V.17 [sic]). Canadian Yachting was acquired By Kerrwil Publications Limited in 1990 after MacLean Hunter had decided to divest its special interest magazines, and, since September 1990 (V.16 no.5), has been published six times a year by Kerrwil Publications. With the acquisition came editor Doug Hunter, his colleague Iain MacMillan, along with Barry Redmayne and Carolyn Haltrect. Canadian Yachting next publisher was Cam MacDonald, who was followed by Elizabeth Kerr, and now Greg Nicoll. The publication launched the first consumer special interest website in 1998. Along with Boating Industry Canada, Canadian Yachting became the first consumer title in the boating magazines category worldwide to launch a digital version. In 2012 Kerrwil set up a new company called Adastra Media Inc. to create a focus for the boating brands while Kerrwil reentered the electrical market in Canada. Adastra is a Latin phrase translated as ‚Äúto the stars‚Äù and was chosen, in part, to honour Jack Kerr, the founder of Kerrwil, and his service in the Royal Canadian Air Force.

The house was built between 1803 and 1804 for John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl in his capacity as the Isle of Man's Governor General.Isle of Man Times, Friday, December 31, 1954; Page: 7 Before 1850 Queen Victoria proposed buying it as a more suitable royal residence than Osborne House.Mona's Herald. Wednesday, May 06, 1903; Page: 7 History=Private residence= The Castle Mona was designed by the eminent architect George Steuart, a native of Perthshire, Scotland, and who arrived on the Isle of Man in 1793. Amongst Steuart's other work were such places as Attingham Hall, Baronscourt and St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury. Apart from the Castle Mona, Steuart's chief work on the Isle of Man was the Red Pier, which with the lighthouse and courthouse he designed and directed the construction of between 1793 and 1799 and the Ramsey Courthouse (constructed circa 1800). In addition Steuart designed the obelisk in Braddan Parish Churchyard commemorating Lord Henry Murray. The Castle Mona was constructed from stone brought from the Isle of Arran, the cost of construction being variously stated from ¬£20,000 to ¬£40,000 with other estimates placing the cost in excess of ¬£50,000. The building was constructed as a perfect square, with an additional wing on the south side. A similar wing was intended for the north side but was never constructed. A circular tower is situated in the center of the structure. The wall facing the sea was ornamented with four plaques. One of the center plaques bearing the coat of arms of the Murray family to which the Duke of Atholl belonged; another bearing the arms of the earlier Earldom of Atholl. The domain adjoining the house was comparatively small terminating on the north side to a point now represented by the end of a row of shops, where a lodge was built. Another lodge stood on part of the site which today is Castle Terrace, and a drive ran through what is today Castle Mona Avenue - the site being formerly known as The Black Lawn. The ground behind the castle rises abruptly in the form of a cliff and this restricted the land available for the grounds of the actual mansion. This restriction led to the Duke's choice of the land to be criticised in some earlier guides to the Isle of Man. However the land behind the cliff, which was also owned by the Duke, stretched up as far as what today is the Glencrutchery Road and which at the time of the early 19th century was said to be thickly wooded. Following the death of the 4th Duke in 1830 the estate was sold, and it was initially planned to break up and apportion the land for building sites. This led to the notion of establishing a new town in the area to be called Woodville, however this merely resulted in a few late Georgian houses bordering on what today is Victoria Road. The Castle Mona (circa 1927) =Hotel= In 1831 the main building was converted into a hotel, with local architect John Welch (who designed such structures as King William's College, the Smelt Monument and the Tower of Refuge) being responsible for the alterations. The first manager of the hotel was William Mallett, who had previously run a London Coffee House. In 1836 the Castle Mona Hotel was bought by George Heron, who had come from the Portabello Hotel in Dublin. As a hotel it became celebrated, an early guest describing it as suitable to: \\"men of rank and fashion.\\" Further alterations to the front of the hotel in the early 20th century saw the erection of a parade of shops. A subsequent addition which further increased the accommodation capacity was added with the erection of a north wing adjoining the original structure. By the 1960s the Castle Mona was widely regarded as the Isle of Man's premier hotel and was the venue of the first licensed casino. Subsequently, the Castle Mona went through various ownership until by the 1990s it had evolved, becoming a leisure and entertainment venue in addition to a 96 bedroom hotel. However a downturn in fortunes occurred in the early 2000s and the Castle Mona Hotel was put up for sale before being closed in 2006. In 2007 the Castle Mona was acquired by the Sefton Group for ¬£4 million with the stated intention of investing in the premises. However no such investment was forthcoming and consequently the structure fell into a significant state of disrepair - the building continuing to languish before once again being placed up for sale in 2011. Various would-be purchasers expressed intentions to purchase the Castle Mona until it was eventually purchased at auction for ¬£1.21 million in April 2018. The identity of the purchaser was kept secret until it was confirmed to be the Tevir Group, and Isle of Man-based property development company.

Early life Greene was born in New York City on September 28, 1854. He was the son of Martin E. Greene (1826‚Äì1907) and Matilda Mary (n√©e Zabriskie) Greene (d. 1898), who had been well known in the older New York society. His maternal grandparents were Mary (n√©e Ryerson) Zabriskie and Andrew Christian Zabriskie, and the Zabriskie family descended from Albrycht Zaborowski, a Polish immigrant from Angerburg (Wƒôgorzewo) in Ducal Prussia, who settled in New Jersey in 1662 alongside a Dutch community. His cousin, Andrew Christian Zabriskie was married to Frances Hunter in 1895, and Alister served as best man. Another cousin, Eliot Zborowski, was married to Margaret Astor Carey, a niece of William Astor Jr., Caroline Astor, and granddaughter of William Backhouse Astor, Sr. of the prominent Astor family. He was a graduate of Columbia College and Columbia Law School. Career After Greene graduated from law school, he \\"devoted his life to study and research in law\\" but never actually practiced law. He was also a volunteer with the 10th company of New York's 7th Regiment, which was referred to as the \\"silk stocking\\" regiment or \\"Blue-Bloods\\", due to the disproportionate number of its members who were part of New York City's social elite, =Society life= In 1892, Greene, who was well known in the \\"New York club and society worlds,\\" was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times.

He was a member of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, serving on its Executive Committee, a life member of the New-York Historical Society (since 1896), and was a member of the Union Club of the City of New York, the Metropolitan Club, the University Club, the Army and Navy Club, the New York Yacht Club, and the American Bar Association. Personal life Greene, who did not marry, lived at 65 East 72nd Street in New York City, one of two four story (and basement) dwellings, covering a plot 40 ft. by 102 ft along with 63 East 72nd Street which was owned by his father. Greene died of pneumonia at his New York residence on March 8, 1923. His funeral was held at the Church of the Incarnation on Madison Avenue. A month after his death, the heirs of his and his later father's estates sold the East 72nd Street properties. In November 1923, his estate sold additional property owned by Greene at 102 Franklin Street (in the modern neighborhood of Tribeca) which consisted of a five-story and basement building on a lot of 25 by 100 feet.

Background McCullough was raised by her mother in Hot Springs, Arkansas, where she graduated from Lake Hamilton High School in 1981. McCullough received her associate degree in physical education from Garland County Community College. She then completed her bachelor's degree at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, on a basketball scholarship as a first-generation college student. After graduating with a B.S.E. in physical education and English, McCullough received an M.S.E. in English from Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. She taught English and basketball at Kingston High School in Madison County, Arkansas, and later at Mountain Pine High School in Garland County, Arkansas. McCullough is the first woman to become president of the Arkansas Basketball Coaches Association. In January 2014, McCullough began teaching English at Little Rock Central High School after she was fired from her job of 14 years as a teacher at Mount St. Mary Academy in 2013 after marrying her partner Barbara Mariani.\\"Mount St. Mary Academy and the firing of Tippi McCullough\\". Arkansas Times, October 24, 2013. Although her relationship with Mariani was well-known of at Mount St. Mary, the school stated that McCullough's marriage violated a morality clause in their contract. This experience encouraged McCullough to become more involved with politics; in 2014, she became president of the Stonewall Democrats where she became more familiar with Arkansan Democratic politics.  2018 Campaign  McCullough, a Democrat, ran as the 33rd District Representative for the 92nd Congress in the Arkansas House of Representatives. The seat was previously filled by Warwick Sabin who ran for mayor of Little Rock. Her opponent in the primaries was fellow Democrat Ross Noland, an attorney and non-profit director at the Buffalo River Foundation. McCullough's primary policy focus during her campaign was education. Her almost two-decade-long experience as a teacher had exposed her to the '\\"struggles'\\" of students, \\"whether it was because they were homeless or hungry or suffering abuse.\\" Her involvement with the Arkansas Education Association had opened her eyes to other issues in the educational system as well. McCullough also objected the unchecked expansion of charter schools and supported more funding for public schools and teachers. Aside from education, McCullough supported the preservation of War Memorial Park as a green space and opposed Governor Asa Hutchinson's tax cuts on wealthy residents. McCullough was elected unopposed in the general election on November 6, 2018, after defeating Noland in the May primaries Political career McCullough is currently serving her first term in the Arkansas House as the representative from District 33, which represents portions of Pulaski County.

The shelter provides meals, shelter, clothing, hygiene services, socio- recreational activities, and practical assistance to women in difficulty. The facility is multi-lingual; the languages spoken are English, French, and Inuktitut.  History  The idea for Chez Doris was formed during a series of conversations between Sheila Baxter and Doris Halfkenny Seale, whom Baxter had been interviewing as part of an effort to interview women prostitutes to learn about their situations and what they needed. Seale, who was also homeless, responded by stating that it would be good to have ‚Äú'a place to go without prying eyes and too many questions'‚Äù. This later prompted Baxter to create a women's shelter for impoverished women in the Montreal area, seeing as how men in the 1970s had their own shelters, but women did not. Seale was found murdered on St. Urbain Street in Montreal's Chinatown on November 2, 1974, prior to the opening of Chez Doris. The murder remains unsolved. Since its opening in 1977, Chez Doris had struggled to retain its daily upkeep, especially after facing large renovation and maintenance costs in 2016. However, following a $1 million donation in 2018 from retired Montreal businessman Andrew Harper, Chez Doris is not only able to sustain regular finances, but also expand its services. Chez Doris is located at 1430 Chomedey Street and offers services to upwards of 80 women per day. Following the donation, Chez Doris bought a second building across the street and announced that it will offer a space for the shelter to open an overnight shelter for women. They are currently undergoing research on the needs of the shelter. The planned expansion includes a 22-bed emergency shelter, funded by the federal government, that is expected to launch in late 2020.

The film stars Alessandro Nivola, Leslie Odom Jr., Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll, Michael Gandolfini, Billy Magnussen, John Magaro, Michela De Rossi, Ray Liotta, and Vera Farmiga. It is set in the 1960s and 1970s in Newark, New Jersey, using the 1967 riots in the city as a backdrop for tensions between the Italian-American and African- American communities. New Line Cinema obtained the rights to produce The Many Saints of Newark alongside HBO Films. Warner Bros. Pictures was to initially release the film on September 25, 2020, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, its release date was rescheduled to March 12, 2021.  Cast  Production =Development= Chase ruled out the idea of continuing The Sopranos story in June 2017, while simultaneously expressing an interest in a prequel to the series. In March 2018, New Line Cinema announced that it purchased the rights to produce the film along with HBO Films, with Chase co-writing the screenplay with Lawrence Konner. New Line's chairman, Toby Emmerich, stated, \\"David is a masterful storyteller and we, along with our colleagues at HBO, are thrilled that he has decided to revisit, and enlarge, the Soprano universe in a feature film.\\" Chase said that the storyline centers on the 1967 Newark riots and racial tensions between the Italian-American and African-American communities. \\"I was interested in Newark and life in Newark at that time ... I used to go to down there every Saturday night for dinner with my grandparents. But the thing that interested me most was Tony's boyhood. I was interested in exploring that.\\" Alan Taylor directed episodes of The Sopranos, and he was hired to direct the film in July 2018. =Casting= In November 2018, Alessandro Nivola was cast to star in the film as Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher Moltisanti. In January 2019, Chase, while discussing the 20th anniversary of the series, revealed that a young Tony Soprano would appear in the film. Jon Bernthal, Vera Farmiga, Corey Stoll and Billy Magnussen were added to the cast that same month. Michael Gandolfini, son of James Gandolfini, was cast in the role of young Tony. Gandolfini, having never watched The Sopranos, watched through it to prepare for the role, describing it as an intense process. Ray Liotta joined the cast in February, with Leslie Odom Jr. and Michela De Rossi joining in March, as well as John Magaro, who starred in Chase's debut feature film in 2012, Not Fade Away. =Filming= Principal photography began in Brooklyn on April 3, 2019, moved to Newark on May 7, and wrapped in June 2019. Branford Place, a street in Newark, was transformed to fit the 1960s time period for the riots, including detailed storefronts, the old Adams Theatre marquee, and the retro neon sign for Hobby's Delicatessen. Luther Engler, a retired Newark police officer, served as a technical adviser for the film. Filming also took place in Bloomfield. Satriale's Pork Store, which was featured in The Sopranos, was recreated in Paterson. Release The film was initially scheduled to be released on September 25, 2020, however, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on theaters and the film industry, its release date was rescheduled to March 12, 2021.

Before 1990 he grew up and, as a young man, built his career in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany): much of his most thoughtful writing continues to relate to those times, along with the tensions and frictions that still resonate from the division of Germany between 1949 and 1990. Biography Christoph Dieckmann was born in Rathenow, a small town in the flat lands to the west of Potsdam and Berlin. He was the middle of his parents' three sons. Hans-Joachim Dieckmann, his father, was a Lutheran pastor, a man of strong principle who never allowed himself or his family to be seduced by the party's \\"socialist\\" group-think. His mother, Annelies, was a teacher. He grew up in the Harz region, first in the little village Dingelstedt am Huy (west of Magdeburg) and later in Sangerhausen. His father nevertheless remained networked with Lutheran pastors in and around East Berlin. As a result of these contacts, when in 1990 Christoph Dieckmann, by this time an ambitious young journalist, needed to improve his English fast, he was tutored in the language by Herlind Kasner (born Herlind Jentzsch), a retired specialist English teacher at the East Berlin Missionary House. His teacher was married to the pastor Horst Kasner. The Kasners were the parents of Angela Merkel. As a teenager he was prevented from undertaking his school leaving exam (Abitur) which under other circumstances would have opened the way to university level education. When the family had lived in the little village of Dingelstedt am Huy the fact that the pastor's son never joined the Free German Youth (\\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\\" / Young Communists) or the \\"Ernst Th√§lmann Pioneer Organisation\\" was not an obvious problem. \\"Christoph does not belong to the socialist youth association\\", his teacher had written to his mother, \\"but he never stands aside when it's a question of working together.\\" Things were different when the family moved to Sangerhausen, which was (and is) a town, and where the party was evidently more omnipresent. The education officer at the school refused him permission to take part in the Abitur exams, regardless of recommendations submitted and the good marks achieved in class. With no prospect of moving on to university, in 1972 Dieckmann therefore embarked on a traineeship at the Langenau film academy as a cine- projectionist. Shortly before he was due to sit the final exams he was expelled from the college in 1974 on \\"disciplinary grounds\\", however. The exam was postponed by a year, but he passed it in 1975. He then moved on to study theology at the Theological Seminar in Leipzig, where he remained till 1978. Between 1978 and 1981 he continued his studies at the \\"Sprachenkonvikt\\" / \\"Latin convictorium\\" in East Berlin. His room at this theological academy here gave him a good view over the wall which since August 1961 had separated the \\"Sprachenkonvikt\\" from the Ecclesiastical Academy at Berlin-Zehlendorf of which it had formerly been an affiliate. His theological training concluded, Dieckmann became \\"vicar\\" to the Evangelical student community of East Berlin and Berlin-Buch. After that, between 1983 and 1986 he worked in the theological studies department of the East German Association of Evangelical churches. Then, until 1990, he was employed as the ecclesiastical media officer at the Ecumenical Missionary Centre and Berlin Mission Society. His first reports and essays covered topics such as rock music, literature and \\"life\\" during the final years of the German Democratic Republic. At this point his work appeared chiefly in church newspapers and in the weekly newspaper Sonntag (\\"Sunday\\"). (The newspaper continued to publish his contributions after Autumn/Fall 1990 when it was sold, rebranded and relaunched as Freitag (\\"Friday\\").) By this time he was primarily supporting himself as a freelance author-journalist. In 1990, through great good fortune (according to his own assessment) Dieckmann, a 34-year-old theologian with uncertain career prospects, received a stipendium from the World Press Institute which enabled him to spend six months in the United States of America. The package even included a viewing visit to the White House. He wrote about his impressions for the weekly newspaper Sonntag, and later published a book entitled \\"Oh! Great! Wonderful! ‚Äì Anf√§nger in Amerika\\" (...a \\"beginner in America\\"). 1990 was Reunification Year, and Dieckmann's public profile in what had been West Germany was raised by his reports from his time in the US. The Hamburg-based national weekly newspaper offered him a contract, and he worked in the newspaper's Berlin office as its first - and for a long time only - East German contributing editor. Initially he signed off his contributions \\"Quoten- Ossi\\" (loosely \\"Quota Easterner\\"): he subsequently switched to the less ironical soubriquet, \\"Ostschreiber\\" (loosely, \\"Writer from the East\\"). By 2014 Dieckmann had published fifteen books. His thought-provoking newspaper pieces and books are wide-ranging, but he returns repeatedly to the subject of East Germany and the so-called \\"New states\\" (\\"neue Bundesl√§nder\\") which replaced it. He describes how the country was and how it has changed since reunification, ranging over the places, the people and daily life. He has described his self-appointed project as one of translation and interpretation (\\"√úbersetzungsarbeit\\"). That also includes explaining the westerners to the easterners. During the 1990s he received prestigious awards for insightful pieces, always crafted from a domestic/native perspective. Reviewers were impressed. Among intellectuals from what had been East Germany, something approaching an informal Dieckmann fan-club emerged, though the wave of enthusiasm has receded during the present century. He still contributes essays and reports about life in the old East Germany, but increasingly he has been reinventing himself as a sport reporter, with a particular interest in football. FC Carl Zeiss Jena appears to be his favourite team by a large margin.  Published output (selection)  Most of the books by Christoph Dieckmann are published by Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin.

It is also observed as an X-ray source and is a member of the open cluster NGC 752. System As a whole, the QX Andromedae system emits light like a stellar blackbody, with a F6 spectral type.

Biography=Early life= Samuel Eusebius McCorkle was born on August 23, 1746, the eldest child of ten in the family of Alexander McCorkle and Agness Margaret \\"Nancy\\" Montgomery McCorkle near Harris's Ferry (present day Harrisburg) in Lancaster County in the Province of Pennsylvania. Both of his parents, from families of Scottish Presbyterian descent, were born in Ulster. They were brought to America during the wave of Scotch-Irish migration in the early 18th century. Samuel's parents took great care in naming him: Samuel for a prophet of God and Eusebius for an early Greek Church historian. At the age of four Samuel was put into an English public school where he learned how to read, write, cipher, and recite Bible verses. This education, very typical of the times, could be summed up as \\"the five R's\\" - Reading, wRiting, aRithmetic, self-Restraint, and Religion. Samuel's schooling continued for five years, till he was nine. In 1756 the McCorkle followed the Great Wagon Trail to North Carolina where they bought messuauge tenement plantation. The tract of land lay on Back Creek, in the vicinity of present-day Mount Ulla near the border of Rowan and Iredell Counties west of Salisbury, North Carolina. There were no schools on the frontier, hence Samuel's schooling was briefly interrupted. During this time he became a very young teacher to his siblings - an experience that would chart the course for the rest of his life. On Sabbath the McCorkles would travel to Cathy's Meeting House (present day Thyatira Presbyterian Church), a substantial log church in the vicinity of Mill Bridge. Sermons were read by the elders of the church with an occasional visit from travelling ministers. In 1760 Crowfield Academy opened in Rowan County (present day Iredell County). Samuel went to Crowfield for a year or two in 1764‚Äì65. Around 1766‚Äì67 Samuel became one of the first students in Dr. David Caldwell's Log College, a theological and classical school for young men. The period of study under Dr. Caldwell had a profound influence on Samuel McCorkle in both religious and scholarly ways. = College of New Jersey years = After completing the studies under Dr. Caldwell, Samuel McCorkle left Rowan County in 1768 to study for the ministry at the College of New Jersey (present day Princeton). The same year John Witherspoon, an influential figure in the development of the United States' national character and forging future religious and civic leaders, became the president of the College of New Jersey. McCorkle was admitted to membership in Cliosophic Society, a literary and debating club at the College of New Jersey, where he was known under the fictitious name \\"Virgil\\". Membership in the society made him a principle target in the \\"Paper War\\" of 1771‚Äì1772 ‚Äî a literary battle of polemics in doggerel, hudibrastics, and prose ‚Äî from the rival Whig Society members Hugh Henry Brackenridge, Philip Freneau, and James Madison. Frequent references to the humble origins of the Cliosophians ‚Äî the manual labors, the poverty, the piety ‚Äî indicate there may have been a social class distinction between the two societies. In 1772, Samuel graduated from the College of New Jersey with a Bachelor of Arts degree. = Clerical apprenticeship = McCorkle was influenced by revival in the spring of 1772 at Princeton and McCorkle began to study for the ministry under his uncle, the Reverend Joseph Montgomery, his mother's brother. = Marriage and children = On July 2, 1776 Samuel McCorkle married Margaret Gillespie, the daughter of Robert and Elizabeth Gillespie (later Steele in second marriage), a prominent Salisbury, N.C. family. They had eight children, six of which lived into adulthood: one son, Alexander \\"Sandy\\", and five daughters, Nancy, Elizabeth, Sophia, Peggy, and Harriet. = University of North Carolina = Samuel McCorkle spearheaded the founding of a university in North Carolina. A university historian, Kemp Battle, acknowledged McCorkle as \\"one of the best friends the University had; [he] worked for it, begged for it; preached for it\\". After the first constitution of the state of North Carolina was adopted in 1776 after the United States declared its independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, work began to establish the independent State of North Carolina. Article 41 of the North Carolina Constitution called for the establishment of affordable schools and universities for the instruction of the young people in the state. Samuel McCorkle made the first attempt to implement article 41. In November 1784 he introduced a bill in the North Carolina General Assembly to establish a state university. The bill was rejected due to financial restraints and political turmoil. In 1789 McCorkle became an original trustee of the institution, the only one who was a clergyman and who had taught. McCorkle procured $42 from the Thyatira congregation after appealing for subscriptions for the foundation of a university. It was the only congregational contribution made in the early history of the university. McCorkle wrote the first university by-laws. They were sent to a committee, amended, and adopted in 1795. From 1795 till 1801 he was the Professor of Moral and Political Philosophy and History. = Zion- Parnassus Academy = In 1793 McCorkle announced a new academy that would prepare men for future university study. The school was to open within the Thyatira congregation and enroll ten students. In January 1794 the academy, named Zion-Parnassus, began operations. McCorkle chose the name to signify the importance of both Biblical (Zion) and classical (Parnassus) education. The academy was modeled on the school of Dr. David Caldwell where McCorkle received his classical education. The instruction was in basic languages and science, using such instruments as globes, a barometer, a thermometer, a microscope, prismatic glass, and surveying instruments. McCorkle was a pioneer in introducing such innovations as agriculture and science laboratories into a school curriculum. In 1787 McCorkle requested and received a collection of books on teaching and pedagogy from Germany that allowed him to introduce teacher training at Thyatira Church. Zion-Parnassus was well known for its normal department, which was the first attempt at teacher training in North Carolina and one of the first in this country, and for its assistance with tuition and books to worthy students. The school maintained a high order of scholarship and had an extensive influence. Six of the seven members of the first graduating class of the University of North Carolina in 1798 received their college preparation in this academy. Forty-five of his students entered the ministry, others became lawyers, judges, and officers of the state.  Philosophical and religious views  McCorkle was a moderate Calvinist, who valued both religious and classical education. During the course of his life he worked to bridge the Old Side‚ÄìNew Side Controversy within the Presbyterian Church in colonial America. Half of McCorkle's published sermons addressed the problems of church division and deism.  Personal library  Samuel McCorkle possessed an impressive and admirable collection of books for back country frontier settlement when books were expensive, minister's salary small, and books were very hard to procure. Authors and books in McCorkle Library On theology: Calvin, Turretin, Stackhouse, Stillingfleet and Owen; in church history, as Owen, Shuckford, Prideaux, and Mosheim (in Latin); on law and civil government, as Puffendorf, Burlemaqui, Montesquieu, and Blackstone, besides the Universal History, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. * F.

It was described from fossil remains from late Quaternary deposits from several sites throughout the island. It was intermediate in size between two extant species of falcon known from Cuba, the American kestrel (F. sparverius) and the merlin (F. columbarius). The species' most distinctive trait is its very long legs, possibly the longest of any species in the genus Falco. With these traits, F. kurochkini was likely a terrestrial bird of open areas, chasing prey on foot not unlike a small caracara. Due to the lack of mammalian predators aside from small insectivores, it also likely nested on the ground or in crevices. Fossil evidence indicates that F. kurochkini was sympatric with the endemic Cuban subspecies of American kestrel (F. sparverius sparverioides), which remains extant today. Unlike its close relative, F. kurochkini likely went extinct due to its terrestrial habits, which made it vulnerable to fires set by Paleo- Indians as well as invasive species introduced by Europeans. It may have become extinct as late as the 17th century, following European colonization of the area.

He is the William Dawson Scholar at McGill University.McGill University. 2018. ‚ÄúEran Shor.‚Äù Retrieved December 5, 2018 (https://www.mcgill.ca/sociology/faculty/eran-shor) His research interests include the causes and effects of political conflict and violence, ethnicity and nationalism, the sociology of health, and the media coverage of women and ethnic minorities. He focuses on the relationship between states‚Äô counterterrorist policies and their respect for human rights and civil liberties. His research methods include computational analysis of big data, cross-national regression analysis and meta-analyses, as well as in-depth qualitative methods and content analysis.  Research  Shor has published more than 50 articles, including many in peer-reviewed journals such as American Sociological Review, American Journal of Sociology, Social Problems, Social Forces, Demography, Social Science Research, Social Networks, Ethnic and Racial Studies, American Journal of Epidemiology, International Journal of Epidemiology, Social Science & Medicine, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Journal of Sex Research, Archives of Sexual Behavior and Violence Against Women. His research findings, including on the longevity of fame, gender roles in the media, unemployment, and mortality, and family ties and mortality, have been discussed and published in multiple media and news sources. = Social conflict and violence = Shor studies the causes and consequences of political conflict and violence. He relies on comparative historical research and media content analysis to look at ethnic conflicts and tensions in countries with large minority populations, with a particular focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He also studies the factors that shape state counterterrorism policies, employing a combination of longitudinal time- series cross-national analyses and case studies. His work demonstrates the importance of socio-cultural processes in determining state policies, and challenges traditional international relations approaches. For example, he found that counterterrorism legislation is primarily motivated by processes of policy diffusion and imitation, in particular spatial diffusion across bordering countries.Shor, Eran. 2017 ‚ÄúWhy do They Legislate? A Cross-National Time-Series Analysis of Terrorism and Counterterrorist Legislation.‚Äù Social Problems 64:106-132. He shows that such legislation typically has no effects in the short run and negative effects in the long run on both the level of terrorist attacks and respect for human and civil rights.Shor, Eran. 2016. ‚ÄúCounterterrorist Legislation and Subsequent Terrorism: Does it Work?‚Äù Social Forces 95:525-557. = Media coverage of women and minorities = Shor uses qualitative content analysis of newspapers. He explores the policing, silencing, and marginalization of immigrants and ethnic minority groups in Canadian and Israeli media. He examines the reaffirmation and redrawing of national and collective boundaries through the exclusion of some ethnic minority groups. He studies mainstream media coverage of ‚Äúhonor killings‚Äù in both Canada and Israel, showing how labels often shape the ways in which journalists think about family murders and the type of motivations they ascribe to perpetrators. In collaboration with Arnout van de Rijt and a group of computer scientists, he collected and analyzed data on millions of individuals from thousands of newspapers and other media over many decades. This work challenged seemingly axiomatic ideas of fame, gender and the media. One study questioned Andy Warhol‚Äôs idea of 15 minutes of fame, that is the idea that fame tends to be ephemeral. Shor showed that, in fact, famous people tend to remain famous for many years.Van de Rijt, Arnout, Eran Shor, Charles Ward, and Steven Skiena. 2013. ‚ÄúOnly Fifteen Minutes? The Social Stratification of Fame in Printed Media.‚Äù American Sociological Review 78:266-289. In another study, Shor and colleagues show that men outnumber women by 5:1 in newspaper coverage. They demonstrate that having more women as executive editors or on editorial boards does not substantially affect these coverage patterns.Shor, Eran, Arnout van de Rijt, Alex Miltsov, Vivek Kulkarni, and Steven Skiena. 2015. ‚ÄúA Paper Ceiling: What Explains the Sex- Ratio Inequality in Printed News Coverage?‚Äù American Sociological Review 80:960-984. = Sexual attraction and sexual violence = Shor researched the foundations of sexual attraction and sexual aversion. Shor and Dalit Simchai challenged the scholarly consensus on the Westermarck effect, which suggests that close domestic proximity during early childhood leads to sexual aversion (also known as reverse sexual imprinting).Shor, Eran and Dalit Simchai. 2012. ‚ÄúExposing the Myth of Sexual Aversion in the Israeli Kibbutzim: A Challenge to the Westermarck Hypothesis‚Äù (reply to Maryanski et al.) American Journal of Sociology 117:1509-1513. Shor and Simchai interviewed men and women who grew up in Israeli kibbutzim, showing that even those who were raised in close proximity were often attracted to one another. In contrast to common evolutionary psychology notions, the primary reason for the avoiding inbreeding among these individuals was fear of damaging group cohesion. Shor looked at portrayals of sexual violence in mainstream internet pornography. In a study with Kimberly Seida, Shor found no consistent uptake in aggressive content of popular online pornographic videos over time. They found that violent porn is less likely to receive views and less likely to be favorably ranked. Instead, most viewers tend to prefer videos where women clearly express pleasure. = Stressful life events, social relationships, immigration and health = Together with David Roelfs, Shor explored the effects of stressful life events and of social relationships on health and mortality in a range of countries and under varying conditions. He employed primarily meta- analysis and meta-regression to re-examine relationships between life events, social support, migration and mortality. Findings include the reaffirmation of the harmful effects of unemployment on mortality,Curran, Peggy. 2011. ‚ÄúMcGill‚Äôs Eran Shor finds losing your job is bad for your health.

She later became a dedicated Christian Missionary, moved to Tirunelveli, South India, where she started her missionary work. She was the first Christian convert of Tirunelveli and also built the first Church of Protestant Christian worship, namely, the well known, Clarinda Church, situated near St. John's College, Palayamkottai, Tirunelveli.  Early years  According to the historical romance novel 'Clarinda A Historical Novel' which is based on the real life of Clarinda, written closer to the times Clarinda lived and the basis for the character profiling of Clarinda and some events of her life in this article, her maiden name was Kokila. She was the ward of her grandfather and was brought up with loving care and given the best of education. As a young girl she was diligent, tenacious and accomplished. Even at that tender age she showed a sense of empathy and was kind and gentle to all. At the same time she was contemporary and bold with outspoken ideas against the customs and superstitions, specifically that of the treatment of women, of those times - characteristics indicating the redoubtable lady she will one day become, as her benefactors would like to say.  Marriage and after  According to common custom in those days she was given in marriage early to a wealthy man of high rank in the royal court. But a short time later her husband died leaving her a widow. It is a common belief that she was rescued from the funeral pyre of the ensuing Sati, by a soldier of the British army, Henry Lyttleton, who was passing along and who took pity on her seeing the plight of her horrendous circumstances. (The historical romance novel (fiction) 'Clarinda A Historical Novel' provides a detailed account of this event.)  Clarinda and Lyttleton  After the rescue, Clarinda and Lyttleton started living together as they found the relationship to be compatible. It is said that they had a son from this consummate partnership though they remained unmarried. Lyttleton being a British Protestant Christian started to familiarise her with the Christian doctrine which she imbibed and embraced wholeheartedly.  Conversion and baptism  right At this point she had personally embraced Christianity completely and had started to live accordingly. Since generally baptism of some kind is a necessary requirement in the Christian doctrine she requested (1774) Rev. C. F. Schwartz, who was a British CMS (Church Mission Society) missionary doing service in those parts and with whom she was acquainted, to baptise her. Anyway Schwartz refused to comply as he thought she was leading a questionable life of sin of illegal partnership. Meanwhile, Lyttleton suddenly died from gout. After about four years (1778), Clarinda once again requested Schwartz to baptise her saying, now that her partner was dead, her past life should in no way be detrimental for her baptism. This time Schwartz, taking into account her life of devotion and selfless service, did not refuse and duly baptised her (1778), changing her name to Clarinda. She was the very first Christian convert in Tirunelveli District.  Missionary work and social service  After her baptism she immersed herself in the missionary work and social services with complete zeal. She brought more willing people into Christianity through conversion in Tirunelveli and suburbs and built the Clarinda Church in Palayamkottai (1784) for the small congregation of fifty people or so to gather and worship. This Church/congregation is said to be the pioneer of the Diocese system that is now in place. She took up the cause of the under privileged, downtrodden, destitutes, widows, orphans providing them the necessary support and aid and education, particularly helping the uneducated poor women towards their empowerment, even in that early semi unenlightened era. She had the Clarinda Church consecrated by Schwartz (1785). This Church now is a major place of worship for Christians and others as well. She was instrumental in building schools in Palayamkottai which are now major educational institutions and other small Churches for the congregations she had managed to form in neighboring villages. For all this she used her own private funds without depending much on contributions or grants. She had to face, along the way, innumerable difficulties, from the non Christian majority around, the schisms of the Church, personal short comings and unexpected hindrances. But she was undaunted and never gave up on her purpose. Many among the Christian communities consider her a veritable and renowned missionary worker of her times. She died in c. 1806.

Leslie S. Klinger has called it \\"the leading publication\\" in the study of Sherlock Holmes. History After the formation of The Baker Street Irregulars in 1934, members would meet at an annual dinner to read papers on the subject of Sherlockian scholarship. In 1944, Edgar W. Smith, the then-head of the BSI, edited and published an anthology of those writings as Profile by Gaslight. Inspired by the publication, Smith began thinking of creating an ongoing academic journal to publish BSI papers. In 1946,The Baker Street Journal was first published. The first issue was lavishly published with Victorian typography, stitched binding and 108 pages of essays, illustrations, and news about Sherlock Holmes. Adrian Conan Doyle initially threatened Smith with a lawsuit for copyright infringement but financial failure ended that incarnation of the magazine in 1949, after a mere thirteen issues, before the Conan Doyle estate could. In 1951, Edgar W. Smith revived the journal in a more modest form with fewer pages, reduced typescript printing, and more affordable materials and binding. In this form, the quarterly has maintained publication ever since. When Edgar Smith died in 1960 after having edited fifty-three issues and an additional five Christmas Annuals, editorship passed to Dr. Julian Wolff. Wolff had been a Baker Street Irregular since 1944 and had already functioned as an Associate Editor during the original series of thirteen issues. In 1975, the Journal began to be published by Fordham University Press which allowed it to be typeset as the original thirteen issue series had been. Wolff went on to edit the Journal for sixty-six issues, from 1961 until 1977. By the late 1980s, the Journal had over two thousand subscribers from readers in such locations as Sweden, Denmark, Japan and Australia. The editors of the new series of the Journal have been Edgar W. Smith, Julian Wolff, John M. Linsenmeyer, Peter E. Blau, Philip A. Schrefler, William R. Cochran, and Donald K. Pollack.Steven Rothman, Introduction to A Remarkable Mixture: Award-Winning Articles from the Baker Street Journal (New York: BSI Press 2007), p. 11. The current editor is Steven Rothman. In 2001, the entire run of the magazine up to that date was released on CD-ROM containing over 16,000 pages. Subsequently, \\"version 2\\" of the CD, including all issues through 2011, was released.

In her short life she published anthems, choruses and cantatas as well as songs, hymns, pieces for solo piano and for piano and other string instruments. As Director of Music Teaching at Wimbledon High School for Girls her particular interest was the encouragement of musical appreciation by young people, in pursuit of which she wrote many compositions for children and schools. Though her music is now seldom heard, her lasting achievement was her well-regarded editorship of The Day School Hymnbook, the expanded edition of which was published shortly after her early death and which brought her posthumously into national prominence.

She developed an early enthusiasm and talent for music, which was encouraged by studying it and by learning to play the piano. Initially, she was taught by her mother, but later she became a pupil of the organist of St Mary's Church, Nottingham, Arthur Page, who taught her the piano and harmony.'Emma Mundella', The Musical Times (London), 01 April 1896, p 246Ebel, Otto, Women Composers, Chandler- Ebel, Brooklyn, New York, 1913 Training in music At the age of 18 she won a Corporation of Nottingham scholarship, worth ¬£40 a year, at the new National Training School for Music (which later became the Royal College of Music) neighbouring the Royal Albert Hall in London. The School opened to students as she arrived, on 17 May 1876. She was among 50 or so young people who had gained the first scholarships.Wright, David, 'The South Kensington Music Schools and the Development of the British Conservatoire in the Late Nineteenth Century', Journal of the Royal Musical Association, Vol 130, No 2 (2005), pp 236-282 The School's Principal was the composer Sir Arthur Sullivan. He tutored Emma Mundella, as did his colleagues, the pianist and composer Ernst Pauer, the composer Sir John Stainer, the musical theorist Ebenezer Prout, the organist and composer Frederick Bridge and others. As well as the piano she studied organ-playing, harmony, counterpoint, composition and singing. When the School evolved into the Royal College of Music in 1883 she was one of the first former students to secure the diploma qualification Associate of the Royal College of Music (ARCM). Teacher Her ambition, as well as to compose, was to teach music, and on leaving college she sought work in schools. Her first post, in 1879, was Director of Music at St Elphin's Clergy Daughters' School in Warrington, Cheshire. There she superintended piano and harmony lessons and took classes in choral singing.'The Late Miss Emma Mundella', The Queen, The Lady's Newspaper (London), 25 April 1896 After a year, in November 1880, she was invited to take the post of Director of Music Teaching at the newly opened Wimbledon High School for Girls. It was a successful appointment and as a result the school won and maintained a high musical reputation. She remained at Wimbledon for 16 years, until her death in 1896. At the school, as well as the regular supervision of the musical curriculum, she inaugurated lectures on musical subjects, organised recitals and started a musical circle of past and present pupils for the encouragement of composition and vocal and instrumental performances. She also composed music for the girls to perform. She was held in great affection by many of her former pupils and friendships were maintained long after they had left the school. Katharine Ramsay, later Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl (1874-1960), a pupil at Wimbledon, wrote in her autobiography that ‚ÄúIn music I had a teacher who I do not believe had her equal throughout the country, Miss Emma Mundella‚Äù, and praised her vigilant attention.Ramsay, Katharine, Working Partnership: Being the Lives of John George, 8th Duke of Atholl and of His Wife Katharine Marjory Ramsay, Arthur Baker Limited, London, 1958 Performer As well as her school activities, Emma Mundella was a piano recitalist; amongst her recitals was a concert presented in the autumn of 1884 which was devoted solely to her performance of a number of the piano works of Edvard Grieg and which provided evidence of her musical abilities and her stamina.Carley, Lionel, Edvard Grieg in England, Boydell Press, 2006 She also carried out duties as an organist at a London church, taught a large number of private pupils, delivered popular lectures on the great musical composers and gathered together a women‚Äôs choir which she conducted. She maintained many friendships in the musical world, leading composers and musicians of the day among them, and was not daunted in approaching some of the most prominent figures in that world for help and advice. Evidence exists in the Edvard Grieg archives that she wrote to him prior to her 1884 recital to seek assistance on the tempo of the Norwegischer Brautzug (the Norwegian Bridal Procession), asking him the speed at which he intended it should be played. She was a prodigious attender of concerts, and her name appeared regularly as one of the guarantors of the Philharmonic Society (later the Royal Philharmonic Society) seasons of concerts at St James‚Äôs Hall and later the Queen‚Äôs Hall. Composer As a composer as well as a teacher Emma Mundella found that there was a lack of suitable progressive music for young students and she did her best to help fill this gap. Over 15 years, from 1881, she composed many pieces of music specifically for young people, including cantatas, anthems, hymns, sacred songs, children's songs, and other choral pieces. An example of her work for young people is Through Wisdom Is An House Builded, an anthem written for the opening of a new school building at Wimbledon which was sung by the school choir and conducted by Emma Mundella at the opening ceremony. She also wrote elementary piano duets for teacher and pupil, and sketches for the piano. Many other compositions were written for adult use, including choral works (both sacred and secular), songs, pieces for the solo piano, and instrumental trios and quartets. Her choral works and songs were invariably written for the female voice. Her publishers were primarily Novello, Ewer and Company (later Novello and Company). At least until the end of the Second World War (her copyright expired in 1946) a number of her works, including particularly a setting of William Shakespeare's Ye Spotted Snakes and an instrumental trio, continued to sell and be performed publicly.Unpublished statement by Emma Mundella's last copyright holder written for academic researcher, c1968 ‚ÄúThe Day School Hymnbook‚Äù Emma Mundella‚Äôs most important work, however, by which she will be remembered, is The Day School Hymnbook (Novello and Company, London, 1890). The first edition, published in 1890, contained 83 hymns. The Musical Times reported that it was remarkably well- received and reviewed and proved her to have the sort of skill in selecting words and music which would win the hearts of the young. Novello and Company requested her to enlarge the scope of her work and make the second issue much more comprehensive. The second edition (Novello and Company, London, 1896), published after her death, in 1896, was, like the first, non-denominational and international in character. It included about 100 further hymns, some with their French, German and Latin words. She wrote new music for 15 existing hymns and invited some of her composer friends, such as John Stainer, Hubert Parry and Frederick Bridge, to contribute. She also included her arrangements of music by composers such as Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert. In its review of this second edition The Musical Times commented: > The wide reading and the musical knowledge it displays are remarkable; here > are old German, French, and English tunes, and many too-much neglected tunes > of the English middle period ... the special contributions of living > composers show how many of her friends took a sincere interest in the > success of the work ... Among the many tunes which here appear for the first > time, some of the most remarkable are from her pen. The Day School Hymnbook is still available in digital reprints. Personal life and early death Little is known of Emma Mundella‚Äôs personal life outside her musical passions and her friendships within the musical community and with her former pupils. She remained single, sharing rooms in Bloomsbury, London with her unmarried younger brother, the Manchester Guardian journalist and education reformer, Anthony John Mundella (Junior).Census Returns of England and Wales, 1891 She died in Marylebone, London on 20 February 1896 following a bowel obstruction which led to sepsis, and heart failure.England and Wales Civil Registration, 1896 Deaths She was buried in the Mundella/Wright family vault in the Nottingham General Cemetery.Inscription on the gravestone of Mundella/Wright vault, Nottingham General Cemetery, Nottingham, England Emma Mundella‚Äôs friend, the composer Sir John Stainer, wrote in her obituary: > The secret of her extraordinary success and influence lay in the fact that > she loved always to do her best because work was to her a privilege as well > as a pleasure, and also because she did not teach others from the height of > a professional pedestal; she was down amongst their hearts with a loving > penetrating sympathy.

Copies of a majority of the works listed are held by the heirs of the Emma Mundella estate.

It lives in association with a hermit crab such as Pagurus bernhardus. It occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Taxonomy This worm was first described in 1822 by the French zoologist Marie Jules C√©sar Savigny who gave it the name Nereis fucata, however it was later transferred to the genus Neanthes, making it Neanthes fucata. Description The body of this segmented worm is long, slender and tapering, with a smooth cuticle. The prostomium bears a pair of antennae, a pair of palps and two pairs of eyes. The first body segment is twice as long as the rest and bears the pharynx and four pairs of tentacular cirri. Segments two and three have uniramous parapodia (unbranched lateral lobes bearing bristles) while the remaining segments bear biramous (two-lobed) parapodia. This worm is yellowish, with longitudinal stripes in red and white. A worm of 120 segments measures about . Distribution and habitat This worm is native to the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, the Kattegat, the North Sea, the English Channel, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. It lives in association with a hermit crab, sharing the shell of the gastropod mollusc in which it lives, but individuals have occasionally been observed away from a host, probably only temporarily. Over much of its range, the normal host is the common European species Pagurus bernhardus which is found on the mid and lower shore and at depths down to about . Ecology Neanthes fucata lives inside an empty gastropod mollusc shell inhabited by a hermit crab. It is able to steal scraps of food from the hermit crab by protruding its pharynx between the crab's third maxillipeds. It has been shown that the crab recognises its commensal worm and does not attack it. A single adult worm inhabits a single host mollusc shell occupied by a hermit crab, but occasionally a single adult and several juveniles have been found living together. The adult worms show territorial behaviour, fighting with other worms of the same species. However the worms are gonochoristic and there must be some mechanism by which a male and female come into close proximity during the period in which they are reproductively active. Some possibilities for this to happen include the hosts being close together, temporary aggregations of individual worms during the breeding season, or by the release of gametes into the sea water.

Indiana, 586 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court dealt with the applicability of the excessive fines clause of the Constitution's Eighth Amendment to state and local governments in the context of asset forfeiture. In February 2019, the Court unanimously ruled that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of excessive fines is an incorporated protection applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Legal background  As formulated, the United States Bill of Rights was meant only to restrict power of the federal government and not at state or local levels, confirmed by the Supreme Court in Barron v. Baltimore (1833).. However, following the American Civil War, Congress ratified the Fourteenth Amendment which included the Due Process Clause, \\"[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\\". Since its ratification, the United States Supreme Court has followed the doctrine of incorporation: generally, all Constitutional rights must also be respected at state and local levels across a range of those rights, with the last such ruling on the topic of incorporation made in McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), relating to the Second Amendment.. The Court has only carved out specific exceptions to the doctrine for certain judicial procedural matters. However, the Supreme Court has never made a judgment broadly related to incorporation towards all parts of the Constitution; what Constitutional rights are incorporated to states have been set by specific cases, and the Court had yet to rule specifically on the Eighth Amendment's excessive fines clause. In more recent years, the question of whether the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive fines applies to state and local laws has been highlighted by the growing use of asset forfeiture, a tactic used since the start of the war on drugs in the mid-1970s to seize cash and material property used in illegal drug transactions. Cash assets are used to help fund law enforcement departments, but it has been found that seized assets like vehicles and homes are sometimes used for the personal gain by law enforcers. It has been argued that the use of asset forfeiture is imbalanced against poor people, who are more likely to be caught in drug trafficking and have the fewest assets to lose, and makes it difficult for such people to re-integrate with society without these assets. The Supreme Court has previously ruled in Austin v. United States (1993) that the Eighth Amendment applies to federal asset forfeitures, protecting citizens from excessive fines which would include asset forfeiture.. In the Supreme Court's 2017 term, a petition for a case related to state-level asset forfeiture had been submitted but the Court was forced to reject it as the petitioner only brought up the Eighth Amendment argument within the writ of certiorari, making the case ineligible for the Court. However, Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurrence to the rejection of the petition, established several factors of why state and local asset forfeiture laws should be re-examined under the Eighth Amendment, identifying similar criticism regarding the unbalanced nature towards the poor.  Case background  Tyson Timbs of Indiana received a cash sum of money from his father's life insurance company upon his father's death in early 2012. Of the money, he used about to purchase a Land Rover. However, Timbs, who had been a former drug addict, fell back to drugs following his father's death, and spent much of the remaining sum on illegal drug purchases as well as participating in drug sales to support his habit. Timbs was arrested by undercover officers during one such sale in November 2013, selling them about of drugs. Timbs pleaded guilty to the charges, and was sentenced to a year of house arrest, five years of probation, and in fines, which he paid. The state, however, also used their forfeiture law to confiscate the Land Rover as a civil action, as Timbs had used the vehicle to transport the drugs. Following his year of house arrest, Timbs found it difficult to get back into society without a vehicle; though he ultimately found a job that accepted his criminal history, it required him to borrow a neighbor's car to make the commute. Timbs, represented by the Institute for Justice, filed suit against the state, arguing that seizing of the vehicle violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines. A Grant County Superior Court judge ruled in Timbs' favor, finding that the value of the Land Rover was over four times the maximum penalty Timbs could have been fined (), and thirty times over the fines he actually paid, and thus was an excessive fine in the context of the Eighth Amendment. The Indiana Court of Appeals agreed with this ruling on appeal from the state. However, at the Indiana Supreme Court, the decision was reversed. The Court argued that the Eighth Amendment only applies for federal actions and does not prohibit state or local laws from imposing excessive fines, and that the Supreme Court had yet to issue any decision that incorporated the excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment to the states.  Supreme Court  Timbs petitioned the US Supreme Court to hear his case, focused on answering the question of whether the \\"excessive fines\\" of the Eighth Amendment apply to state and local governments as through the Due Process Clause. The Court accepted the case in June 2018. Timbs' case received bipartisan support. Among those filing amicus briefs in support of Timbs included the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Judicial Watch, and Pacific Legal Foundation. The United States Chamber of Commerce also filed a brief in support, arguing that just as individuals are harmed by unreasonable asset seizure, companies often end up incurring large fines under state and local laws for small violations. Oral arguments were heard on November 28, 2018. Observers believed that on the constitutional question, the Justices were weighed heavily in favor of asserting that the excessive fines clause was another right that should be incorporated to states. However, these observers also believed that while the question did favor Timbs' case, the Court appeared to be ready to vacate the Indiana Supreme Court decision and rehear the case to determine if the forfeiture of the vehicle was to be considered as an excessive fine. The Court issued its decision on February 20, 2019, unanimously stating that the Eighth Amendment's protection from excessive fines was incorporated against the states. The opinion was written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with all but Clarence Thomas joining, stating that the Eighth Amendment is incorporated to states under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Ginsburg's opinion referred to the protection from excessive fines as a key right as early as the Magna Carta, and that this protection \\"has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history: Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties\\". Justice Thomas wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment that protection from excessive fines is incorporated, but did not accept that the Due Process clause was the right constitutional reason for this but generally as part of Privileges or Immunities Clause defined by the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Neil Gorsuch, though joining on the majority opinion, also wrote a similar concurring opinion, stating that the incorporation was best defined as part of the Privileges or Immunities Clause. The Court vacated the Indiana Supreme Court's decision, and remanded Timbs' case to be reheard. The Supreme Court did not offer any tests in their opinions as to how to measure when fines are deemed excessive, a matter that is expected to require additional case law to establish. Ginsburg's opinion did suggest that the seizure of Timbs' Land Rover was disproportionate to the crime, but this was to be resolved by the lower court. Subsequent events Timbs' case was reheard by the Grant County Court, which on April 27, 2020 ruled in Timbs' favor based on the Supreme Court's ruling related to the Eighth Amendment, that seizure of the Land Rover was an excessive fine, and ordered the Land Rover returned to Timbs. While the state appealed the decision, it did agree to return the vehicle on the condition that Timbs would not sell or give it away as the case continued in court. Impact The Court's ruling is expected to affect the use of asset forfeiture at state and local levels, a common practice to help partially fund police forces. There is also speculation by supporters of criminal justice reform that the decision may affect the use of confiscation of driver's licenses to compel payment of fines and fees, as well as imprisoning those unable to pay bail or fines for otherwise minor crimes.

They are mostly known for having started one of the few distribution chain of hardware and household articles during the thirties of the twentieth century.  Overview  The Morassutti family, active first in the trade of hardware and wood, then in the field of household objects constituted in Italy during the 20th century an innovative sales systems: both with the use of catalogs and service to the retailer as well as by proposing modern techniques of self-service and atypical franchising. The Paolo Morassutti company became a point of reference for the Italian hardware market and it retraced the growth hubs already experienced by the American wholesale trade. Their commercial strategy was characterized by product specialization, differentation in pricing policies according to the different geographical areas of Italy, retail stores chain and by transferring know-how of sales and management to retail customers, such as the use of stock management as well as a propensity for innovative marketing. Print for the 70th birthday of Federico Morassutti  Federico Morassutti  (22 October 1876 - 17 April 1954) was an Italian entrepreneur and philanthropist, a prominent member of the Morassutti family mostly known for his farsighted entrepreneurial choice of creating a network of shops, a veritable supply chain of long-lived consumer goods. In 1886, at the age of ten, Federico was sent to a boarding school in Cremona, and from there abroad, to Grenoble and Ljubljana, to perfect his education and gain experience in trade-related matters. During that time the family company was experiencing a period of uncertainty. In 1898, at the death of his father, the management of the company passed to Federico, twenty-two years old at that time, who initially devoted himself to consolidating the financial situation in order to grow by expanding from regional borders and by launching the company into the national market. The \\"Great War\\" considerably reduce the company's commercial activity, particularly in the retail sector but during the post-war years it was relaunched. New deposits were opened, first in Bologna and later in Naples placing the company at the forefront of the national panorama of the distribution sector. In 1922 The Paolo Morassutti was transformed into a collective company formed by Federico as the managing director and by his brothers Giovanni Paolo, Domenico and Antonio. From there to a few years, however, in conjunction with the general crisis of the thirties, different views emerge between the brothers. In the late thirties the company was booming and at the beginning of the fifties the company employed more than 500 employees, located in 21 stores. In 1952 the company itself changed its structure becoming a modern joint-stock company. During The Fifties, The Paolo Morassutti company, with a capital of 210 million lire, employed about 570 employees located in 24 settlements (20 stores and 4 depots) spread throughout the country: from Veneto to Lazio, from Liguria to Emilia, from Lombardy to Campania. Federico Morassutti died in Padua in the spring of 1954 after establishing his family business among the leading companies in the wholesaler distribution sector of Italy during the second half of the 20th century.

The poem Al Mar de la Montana was inspired by the sixth century philosopher, mathematician Thales of Miletus.\` The Sinfonia Latina program was repeated in its entirety a second time at the ¬¥club Campestre¬¥in Barranquilla, Colombia on May 26, 1976, by popular request. Sinfonia Latina was Mr. Dieppas first major event in his career.  The program, poetry in Spanish  The \\"Supershow\\" had four parts intended to be an eclectic demonstration of arts.Ray Safdeye presented the program, the first part opened with Juan Manuel Reyes a classical pianist performing Bach preludes..The second part followed with a visual performance by artist Sergio Gonzalez who presented the special show 'Death to color'. Following, the third part was Sinfonia Latina fusing Caribbean rhythms, salsa, jazz, & rock, into a classical symphonic format. A dancer appeared during the final movement. The program ended with balloons rising from the orchestra pit while the group performed rock and roll encores.

The voices of the choir converged singing in Spanish ‚ÄòSinfonia Latina‚Äô. with a beautiful result...  Planning and preparation  The event was initiated by the efforts of Mauricio Zapata executive director of Midnight Sun Productions. Zapata had organized several smaller rock concerts. The concert was planned as a for profit venture. It became a free festival when thousands of people arrived for an event planned for a few hundred. Planning and preparation was financed by donations, Nestor Mosseres (Mosseres & Cia), Siman Plast, Zippers Yidi, and an unknown funder. Each of the four businessmen contributed 400 pesos to the project for transportation, food, and beverages for the musicians. Nine months of rehearsal and preparation leading up to the event depleted the funds. The venue was selected by Midnight sun productions. The production crew was able to negotiate an agreement from Rafael Juliao and Alfredo de la Espriella. The theater was still inoperable. The late Carlos Dieppa Delgado's memory,.reputation, previous presidency at the ‚ÄòCenter for the Arts‚Äô, grandfather of the composer, appears to have aided in securing the contract. The venue was used for gaining attention towards the completion of the empty half way built theater.  Social impact  The event had overwhelming public support. It attracted people from all social strata Singled out by Margarita Galindo S., the poetry was sung in Spanish.

After graduating from Cambridge University and St Thomas' Hospital, he operated throughout the Blitz and in the Tunisian Campaign, where he received the Military Cross. After the Second World War, he became involved in the vascular surgery programme at St Mary's Hospital, London where he carried out one of the world's first carotid endarterectomies and a year later performed the UK's first deceased donor human-to-human kidney transplant. His contributions paved the way for St Mary's in becoming a pioneering centre in vascular surgery and transplant surgery. In 1960, he moved to the United States and continued developing techniques in vascular surgery including vein by-pass grafting. Early life and education Charles Rob was born on 4 May 1913 in Weybridge, England. His father was Joseph William Rob, a family physician, and his mother was a descendant of Edward \\"Grog\\" Vernon, the British Admiral who introduced diluted rum for Royal Navy sailors in the 18th century. He was educated at Hordle House and Oundle before going on to graduate from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1934. During his time there, he once climbed one of the spires of King's College to place an open umbrella on the top. He also joined the university air squadron to train to be a pilot. After receiving a reserve commission as a pilot in the Royal Air Force he transferred to St Thomas's Hospital for his clinical attachment. In 1937, he graduated with an MB from Cambridge University. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1937 and, after two years of surgical training at St Thomas's, he gained his FRCS. Second World War At the onset of the Second World War in 1939, Rob was at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, but shortly returned to St Thomas's hospital to work throughout the Blitz (1940‚Äì1941). Here, he met Mary Dorothy Elaine Beazley, who had worked as secretary and secret courier to Royal Air Force officer William Wedgwood Benn, and had subsequently enrolled in the Florence Nightingale School. They married six weeks later and later had two sons and two daughters. He was later made resident assistant surgeon at Hydestile Hospital, close to Godalming and had also operated in bunkered operating rooms at St. Mary's hospital. He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in November 1942 and was posted to the 1st Parachute Battalion as a surgical specialist. He took part in the mission to seize the Souk-el-Arba Airfields and the road junction at B√©ja during the Tunisian Campaign. Here, he performed more than 150 operations after converting the French garrison school into a hospital. He suffered a left tibia and kneecap fracture when a bomb fell, and was reported to have used his own blood to transfuse a wounded person. After 24 days, he had treated over 200 people. He was awarded the Military Cross for his efforts. After leaving Tunisia he took up command of a field surgical unit in Sicily and Italy and became lieutenant colonel. Surgical career in England Upon return to London after the Second World War, Rob resumed duties at St Thomas' Hospital and later became professor of surgery at the University of London and St. Mary's Hospital in 1950. During his time as professor of surgery, he was involved in the vascular surgery programme and also became advisor to royalty and Winston Churchill. Michael DeBakey performed the first carotid endarterectomy in 1953 and the procedure became better known after Rob and his colleagues performed one in 1954. The operation proved to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with significant blocked carotid arteries and he reported to have carried out more than 5000 of these operations in his lifetime. In addition, he introduced using frozen cadaver arterial grafts in the treatment of aortic aneurysms. In 1955, he presented his experiences of over 30 abdominal aortic aneurysms to the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1955, Rob performed the UK's first recorded deceased donor renal transplant with Hammersmith hospital's surgeon Jim Dempster, at St Mary's Hospital. The recipient had developed acute renal failure following a septic abortion and was considered by Dempster as not ideal for transplant and an unnecessary fatal disaster. However, it instilled an interest in further transplantation developments at St Mary's, which became regarded as pioneers in this field. Surgical career in the United States In 1960 Rob accepted the position of chief of the Department of Surgery at the University of Rochester, Strong Memorial Hospital and moved to the United States. Here, he continued to develop the technique of vein by-pass grafting. In 1961, after recalling that cloth grafts had been used in the aortas of pigs, he used his shirt to successfully repair an aortic aneurysm in a human. After debriding and resecting the aneurysm, the two open ends of the aorta needed to be rejoined with a graft, but the surgeons found that no graft was available to complete the procedure. To the surprise of his colleagues in theatre, Rob called for the shirt in his locker, cut out a rectangle and stitched it into a tube to be used as a graft, possibly the first use of a synthetic vascular graft in a human. The patient survived and the assistant recalled meeting the patient again eight years later. After retiring in 1978, he moved to East Carolina University, taking an appointment as professor of surgery. Five years later he joined the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences at Bethesda, near Washington DC. He was a past president of the International Society of Cardiovascular Surgery and the North American Chapter of the International Cardiovascular Society. He was awarded the Ren√© Leriche prize of the International Society of Surgery. In 1994, he required a carotid endarterectomy himself. Death and legacy Rob died of heart disease while visiting relatives on 26 July 2001 in Berlin. Apart from his medical innovations, he has been remembered for his saying on the treatment of a gangrenous limb: \\"The best treatment for the condition is rest. The best way to rest is sleep. The best way to get sleep is to relieve pain, and the best way to relieve pain is to give whiskey.\\" Selected publications Rob published more than 200 papers.

In just eight weeks, Canmar's engineering and design team developed an icebreaker concept which emphasized simplicity and ease of construction to ensure quick delivery. While traditional icebreakers featured rounded hulls which were expensive to produce, in Canmar's design approximately 80% of the shell plating consisted of flat plates and hard chines. The spoon-shaped bow also featured reamers to improve turning capability in ice by breaking a channel that wider than the vertical-sided midbody. While the hull surface was initially left unpainted with only a handful of sacrificial anodes, the bow was lined with nozzles that pumped 12,000tons of sea water per hour onto the ice to reduce hull-ice friction. In the engine room, the simplest type of propulsion system was adopted: while most icebreakers featured diesel-driven generators, transformers and electric propulsion motors driving multiple shafts, Canmar opted for two medium-speed diesel engines mechanically geared to a single propeller shaft. The controllable-pitch propeller was shrouded in a nozzle that not only protected it from ice, but also increased thrust by 30% at lower speeds.Icebreaker Kigoriak a success! Northern Development, Winter 1979. Page 8.Ice record breaker. Marine Week, October 1979.Icebreaker Kigoriak tames hostile Arctic. The Calgary Herald, 9 February 1980. The lack of a protective coating was a serious mistake in the cold, oxygen rich, seawater and, despite the anodes, the vessel suffered from major corrosion and serious weld erosion. The vessel was placed in a floating dock in the Beaufort sea. Plates were replaced and welds were replenished and the entire underwater area was fresh water washed, blast cleaned and coated with about 700 microns of an ice resistant coating (Inerta 160) which had been developed in Finland. This coating basically preserved the vessel and improved the ice breaking capability. After the icebreaker concept had been developed, Canmar hired the Vancouver-based engineering company Arctic Offshore Design to produce a tender package which was then handed over to Saint John Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company for detailed planning and construction. Laid down on 5 April 1979 and launched only few months later as Canmar Kigoriak, the icebreaker was built in record time of only eight and a half months at a cost of about 25 million Canadian dollars. She was delivered to Canmar on 4 September 1979 and hastily departed to the Beaufort Sea shortly afterwards. = Canmar Kigoriak (1979‚Äì1997) = Canmar Kigoriaks primary mission was to protect stationary drillships from drifting ice through ice management. When a potentially dangerous ice feature was detected approaching the drill site and the spread- moored drillship, the icebreaker was dispatched to break it up into smaller pieces that would not pose a threat to the drilling operation; this allowed extending the drilling season by starting it earlier and ending it later. In addition, she was used for other tasks such as escorting drillships to and from the drill site. During the winter months, the vessel was left unmanned in cold lay-up together with other Canmar vessels. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Canmar Kigoriak was tested in all ice conditions found in the Beaufort Sea. In addition to determining the icebreaker's operational capability and limitations in extreme conditions such as large multi-year ice floes, systematic research was carried out gain understanding on full-scale ship-ice interactions in order to develop feasible solutions for year-round transporting oil and gas from the Arctic in the future. During these trials, the hull and propulsion system were extensively instrumented to measure vessel motions and structural response during icebreaking operations. The tests, which began with the main voyage through the Northwest Passage and continued both during and outside of the drilling operations, demonstrated that Canmar Kigoriak was able to operate safely in ice conditions far beyond what was specified for her ice class. Despite ingesting two foreign objects (a mooring buoy and a steel I-beam) during the early years, the single-screw vessel could continue independent operations at moderate power levels without immediate repairs. Following Canmar Kigoriaks arrival to the Beaufort Sea in late 1979, the Canmar drillships drilled a total of 25 wells for Dome Petroleum and other oil companies in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea.Callow, L. (2012): Oil and Gas Exploration & Development Activity Forecast, Canadian Beaufort Sea 2012 ‚Äì 2027. LTLC Consulting in association with Salmo Consulting Inc. April 2012. In addition, four more wells were drilled by the drillships in the Alaskan waters in 1985‚Äì1991. Other wells were drilled from artificial drilling islands as well as novel drilling systems such as Kulluk and the single steel drilling caisson.Beufort Sea Exploration Wells. BOEM. While a number of oil and gas discoveries were made, none of the findings were sufficient to warrant commercial production. Following the falling oil prices in the 1980s and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, hydrocarbon exploration in the Beaufort Sea and the MacKenzie Delta gradually ended.Oil and Gas Exploration & Development Activity Forecast, Canadian Beaufort Sea 2013-2028. Lin Callow, LTLC Consulting, March 2013. In 1994, Canmar Kigoriak took part in disbanding Canmar's Arctic drilling fleet: after towing the laid-up drillship Canmar Explorer out of long-term storage in McKinley Bay and handing her over to a Russian tug bound for scrapyard in the Far East, she returned to collect the 30,000-ton floating dock Canmar Careen that was relocated to British Columbia to be stored until sold.1994 Sales and Charters.

The experience gained from Canmar Kigoriak and Canmar's subsequent icebreakers was used in the design of the 1988-built Swedish icebreaker Oden which incorporates some design aspects of the Canadian icebreakers' hull form, propulsion and auxiliary systems used to reduce ice resistance.New Powerful Icebreaker Under Construction At Gotaverken Arendal.

After reflagging the vessel to Liberia and shortening her name to Kigoria, the full commercial and operational management was entrusted to International Transport Contractors (ITC), a subsidiary of the Norwegian-based Tschudi Group. Initially, she was chartered to support laying submarine communications cables such as Alaska United linking the State of Alaska to the Contiguous United States.ITC NewsWaves Issue 2, October 1998. ITC NewsWaves Issue 3, May 1999. ITC NewsWaves Issue 4, November 1999. In 2000, Kigoria was also used to remove and dispose of a section of the first transatlantic telegraph cable laid by the SS Great Eastern in 1866.ITC NewsWaves Issue 6, May 2001. Despite being originally built as an icebreaker, Kigoria was often used in marine salvage operations where her large cargo deck and powerful crane were found useful. In August 1999, she was dispatched to search for a general cargo ship Lady Belle which had been abandoned in mid-Pacific following an engine room fire, but the stricken freighter was never found and the search was called off. In a more successful salvage operation in 2000, Kigoria refloated the 35,000-ton bulk carrier Bovec at Tuck Inlet near Prince Rupert, British Columbia. The ship had been awaiting for berthing in ballast when she began dragging anchors in a storm and drifted around. At low tide, her hull was subjected to excessive longitudinal stresses as the aft section with engine room, propeller and rudder was hanging unsupported in mid-air, completely out of the water, and there was a serious danger that the vessel would break in two during the upcoming spring tide. While Bovec was later declared constructive total loss and sold for scrap, the salvage operation was successful: with nearly 200 tons of pulling force, Kigoria managed to drag the bulk carrier off the rocks.Major Marine Vessel Casualty Risk and Response Preparedness in British Columbia. EnviroEmera Consulting Services, July 2008. ITC NewsWaves Issue 5, July 2000. Another successful salvage operation involving a 25,250-ton Panamian-flagged tanker Shauandar was completed off the Cuban coast few years later.ITC NewsWaves Issue 7, April 2002. In January 2003, Kigoria was dispatched from Bermuda to salvage the Finnish-flagged ro-ro vessel Camilla that had been abandoned off Newfoundland due to engine troubles. Despite heavy weather, Kigoria managed to take the stricken vessel into tow and bring safely to Conception Bay.Ms CAMILLA, vaaratilanne ja aluksen evakuointi Pohjois-Atlantilla 23.1.2003.

Kigoria was also regularly employed for long and challenging ocean towages either alone or in co-operation with other tugs. In late 2000, she towed the jackup rig Rowan Gorilla III from Halifax, Nova Scotia south along the Atlantic coastline. While the contract stipulated that Kigoria was to utilize only one of her two main engines at a time, the second engine was started after four days when the three-vessel convoy encountered up to swells and force-10 south-easterly winds, and the jackup rig with legs arrived safely in Sabine Pass, Port Arthur, Texas just before Christmas. Next year, Kigoria participated in towing the submersible laybarge LB 200 from North Sea to the Caribbean across the Atlantic with another tug. On the return leg, she towed a 61,500-ton tanker Berthea from Houston, Texas to Hamburg, Germany, for engine repairs in 31 days on her own and without utilizing more than 70% of her engine power. Shortly afterwards, she did another westbound trans-Atlantic crossing with an average speed of , towing the accommodation platform Safe Britannia, and returned with the semi-submersible drilling rig Ocean Whittington that was towed from Brazil to the Namibian coast. After having remained in the West African offshore fields for some time, the heavy icebreaker was contracted for yet another transatlantic tow when the semi-submersible accommodation platform Polyconcord was relocated from Madeira to the Cantarell Field off Mexico. In 2002, Kigoria finally returned to the Arctic when she was chartered to tow the single steel drilling caisson (SSDC) in co-operation with another icebreaker, Arctic Kalvik. The 125,000-ton Arctic drilling unit, which consists of the forward two thirds of the hull of a very large crude carrier mated with a submersible barge, would be used to drill an exploratory well for Encana Oil & Gas at the McCovey prospect. The tow from Port Clarence, Alaska to Prudhoe Bay was completed in just 12 days.An Arctic Tow by ITC. Maritime Journal, 1 January 2003. In the following summer, Kigoria returned to the Beaufort Sea to tow the SSDC to a storage location near Herschel Island. This month-long round trip via the Northwest Passage marked the end of ITC's five-year management of the vessel: shortly afterwards, Kigoria was sold to Russia.ITC NewsWaves Issue 9, 2005. = Talagy (2003‚Äì2010) and Kigoriak (2010‚Äìpresent) = Kigoriak in Gdynia, Poland, in 2018. In late 2003, Kigoria was acquired by a joint venture between the Russian FEMCO Group and the Netherlands-based Smit Terminals and reflagged to Russia. Following a refit in Gdansk, Poland, the icebreaker was chartered to provide icebreaking and escort services to tankers calling Rosneft's oil terminal near Arkhangelsk. She was renamed Talagy (Russian: –¢–∞–ª–∞–≥–∏) after a village in the Arkhangelsk region where the terminal is located.Supply & Tug Supply Boat Market Report. Marcon International, Inc. October 2003. However, few years later she was moved to the Sakhalin region to support ExxonMobil's Sakhalin-I project.TUG Magazine June 2006 . TUG Magazine October 2005 .

Later that year, the vessel was given back part of her original name, Kigoriak (Russian: –ö–∏–≥–æ—Ä–∏–∞–∫). In 2011, Kigoriak participated in towing the 117,000-ton, ice-resistant offshore platform for the Prirazlomnoye field from Murmansk to the Pechora Sea.Towing of the Prirazlomnoya platform to field started.

Shipspotting.com. In 2019, she participated in Gazprom's drilling operations in the Kara Sea.  Design  Kigoriak is long overall and between perpendiculars. Her hull has a beam of amidships and over the reamers. She has a maximum draught of and moulded depth of . The simplified hull geometry pioneered by the Canadians consists mainly of flat plates and hard chines. Kigoriaks spoon-shaped icebreaking bow has a flat stem and sharp shoulders followed by the channel-widening reamers at the waterline and a heavy forefoot followed by a full-length box keel. Abaft, she has a simple barge-type hull with a single chine and a vertical sides ending to an undercut stern. Compared to traditional icebreakers with rounded bilges, the simplified hull geometry also help to dampen rolling in open seas. Internally, the hull is divided into seven watertight compartments, two of which can flood without sinking or capsizing the vessel, and all fuel tanks are protected by double sides to prevent spills in the event of hull damage. At the time of delivery, Kigoriak was the first icebreaking vessel built to meet the requirements of the Canadian Arctic Shipping Pollution Prevention Rules (CASPPR).A Pioneering Icebreaker/Tug for Arctic Development (Canmar Kigoriak). Motor Ship, 60 (1980) Rated Arctic Class 3, she was designed to maintain forward motion through of ice. However, her bow was strengthened above Arctic Class 4 requirements and she also had sufficient propulsion power to meet the higher requirements. Kigoriak has a diesel-mechanical propulsion system with two medium-speed diesel engines driving a single four-bladed ducted controllable pitch propeller. The twelve-cylinder Sulzer 12ZV40/48 main engines are rated at each and geared to the propeller shaft using wet clutches that allow slipping at torque peaks to protect the drivetrain from damage. The main engines can also be used to power the hull lubrication system: when the vessel is moving at a speed of , the system's two pumps create a water cover on the ice over the full beam of the vessel. For maneuvering, the vessel has two transverse tunnel thrusters: one in the bow and another in the stern.Technical Specification \\"Kigoriak\\". FEMCO.

She was the first woman to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs and first Kazakh diplomat to participate in the General Assembly of the United Nations. She was honored with numerous medals and awards, including the Order of the Badge of Honour and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. Early life Balzhan Bulktikovna Bultrikova was born on 15 November 1921 in the village of Kassyk in the Jambyl Region of Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic, which was a part of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. She was the youngest child in a family with two older brothers and from a young age wanted to become a teacher and attend school so that she would not have to labor in the beet harvests. She attended the local school and after the sixth grade began teaching adult literacy classes. When she graduated, as the top student in her school, Bultrikova won a gold medal and a trip to Moscow. In 1937, Bultrikova moved to Almaty to attend the normal school run by Lyubov Aleksandrovna Fedulova. Easily passing the entrance exams, she admired Fedulova, and was grateful that her Russian-exiled teacher could help with learning Russian. During her schooling, she met and married Iskander Kozhabayev, one of the first Kazakhs to defend a PhD. Graduating with honors in 1941, enrolled in the Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University to continue her education, studying language and literature. Because of the war, she transferred to the correspondence courses, finishing her education in 1943, with distinction. Career In 1942, Bultrikova began her career as the head teacher of Lepsinsky High School in the Taldy-Kurgan Oblast, while still in school. After a few months, she was transferred to Almaty high school ‚Ññ12, where she would become the school's director. In 1949, Bultrikova was elected as chair of the Primary and Secondary School Worker's Union of the Central Committee of the Kazakh Communist Party. Serving in the post until 1955, the following year she became the Minister of Social Security for the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. In this post, she focused on providing humanitarian assistance to vulnerable sectors of society including disabled persons, the elderly, orphaned children and veterans. In addition to providing pensions, she organized kindergartens and nurseries; sponsored schools and workshops to assist blind, deaf and mute Kazakhs; and established a factory to build prosthetics. In 1957, in recognition of her work, she was awarded the Order of the Badge of Honour. For a decade she served in the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, before being promoted in 1966 as Deputy Chair of the Council of Ministers and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the first Kazakh woman appointed to serve as Foreign Affairs Minister. That same year, she was selected to serve on the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. She was the first Kazakh representative to the United Nations General Assembly. and served for five and a half years in the post. In the 1970 session (25th Session) of the general assembly, she worked to counter the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights, as the USSR had ordered delegates to remove the issue from the agenda, as one that was not beneficial to the nation. Twice she used her diplomatic skill with Asian and African delegates to prevent the development of the post. She was awarded for those efforts with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. At the end of her term in 1971, Bultrikova was appointed as the Minister of Education and Science of the Kazakh SSR, serving to 1974. That year, she became the Deputy Chair of the State Committee on Professional Education. During her tenure, she worked to improve secondary education in Kazakhstan, converted primary schools to full-time facilities, and developed vocational and technical schools, before her retirement in 1980.

The design and construction of the clock was overseen by Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio, also known as Giovanni de' Dondi, who was an Italian physician, astronomer and mechanical engineer from Italy. Dondi was assisted by Gian Petro Dalle Caldiere. The clock has references to the zodiac throughout its design. However, on the original clock, the Libra sign was not present, as with the pre-Roman system Scorpio and Libra were one Zodiac sign. The clock's dial depicts the earth in the middle, the phases of the moon, days, months. and the signs of the zodiac. Today, the clock is open to the public.

Though not strictly a Jewish summer camp, Mishmar predominately catered to a middle- and upper-class Jewish clientele. In its seventy year history, the camp hosted a number of prominent future writers, businesspeople, and politicians. History Camp Mishmar was founded by Chaim Pripstein, a Hebrew teacher at United Talmud Torahs who had fled Poland to Canada before World War II. A Hebrew teacher at United Talmud Torahs, Pripstein became a peddler in the Laurentians to supplement his income, acquiring land from a local farmer near St. Jerome in 1941. Pripstein decided to rent it out to local Jewish families during the summer, and soon left his job as a school teacher to run a modest Jewish country hotel on the land with his wife Pearl. The hotel became known for its literary gatherings, hosting such writers as Isaac Bashevis Singer. As their business grew, the Pripsteins set up a residential camp for about ten children, which quickly grew into a proper summer camp complete with a playing field and tennis court. The camp emphasized Jewish culture and physical fitness. The camp relocated to the shore of Lac des Trois Fr√®res in St. Adolphe d'Howard in 1954, after local authorities deemed the river running through the original site polluted. At its peak in the 1960s, the camp had an average of 240 campers each summer. The camp was closed in 2014 because of declining enrolment and financial difficulties. Facilities Camp Mishmar boasted top-quality sports facilities, including a covered pool, a covered basketball court, a 19,000-square-foot sports complex with an indoor roller rink, skate park and rock climbing centre, and an indoor ice rink. Food at Camp Mishmar was 'kosher style', though the camp only served kosher meat in its early years. Jewish rituals such as lighting Shabbat candles were nonetheless maintained. Literary references Leonard Cohen fictionalized Pripstein's Camp Mishmar in The Favourite Game (1963), which was based upon a journal he kept while working at the camp as a counsellor.

It was also only the second dictionary of a modern European language, being just one year later than the Tesoro de la lengua castellana o espa√±ola by Sebasti√°n de Covarrubias in Spain in 1611. Background Stone plaque commemorating the first Vocabolario in via Pellicceria, Florence, near the Palazzo di Parte Guelfa In 1583 the Accademia della Crusca was founded in Florence with the aim of codifying the Tuscan dialect and producing a comprehensive dictionary, drawing mainly on the lexicon of canonical literary texts from Florentine authors of the 'golden age' in the fourteenth century, such as Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio.:it:Lorenzo Tomasin, Italiano. Storia di una parola, Carocci editore, Roma 2011, pag. 104. Work on the Vocabolario was begun in 1591 thanks to Lionardo Salviati's interest in philology. His search for words extended beyond the published works of great writers to include the unedited manuscript texts held in the collections of the various Florentine academies; he also compiled usage from writers after the golden age, including Lorenzo de' Medici, Francesco Berni, Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, and, indeed, from his own writing. He also drew on non-Florentine sources such as Pietro Bembo and Ludovico Ariosto.Amedeo Benedetti, L'Accademia della Crusca e la sua biblioteca, \\"Biblioteche Oggi\\", n. 9, November 2007, p. 44. The work was edited entirely in Florence ‚Äì eventually, thirty six academicians were working full time on it ‚Äì although the printing was done in Venice under the supervision of the Accademia's secretary, :it:Bastiano de' Rossi. The original title for the work was Vocabolario della lingua toscana (1608) However when it was in its final stages of development and a request for permission to print had already been sent, a lengthy discussion started among the academicians as to whether a different title should be used. Failing to reach unanimity on this, they eventually adopted the neutral title Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca along with the subtitle As derived from the writers and usage of the city of Florence. The original title was retained however on the licence to print granted by the Republic of Venice in January 1611.L. Tomasin, op.cit., pag. 105. First edition The editio princeps was published in 1612. The work was innovative because it was one of the first examples of organising entries in alphabetical order rather than by topic, as then became the norm for this kind of book.Amedeo Benedetti, cit., p. 44. In other respects, it was organised differently to sixteenth-century lexicons, with less distinction between the language of prose and the language of poetry, as well as fewer references to regional uses and grammatical issues. In terms of etymology the only words analysed are those which are courteous and relevant (\\"che abbiano gentilezza e sieno a proposito\\") are covered. As far as lemmas are concerned, there were a great many local Florentine forms, as well as a number of latinisms. Among the items not included were terms either already in common use or particularly obscure. Technical and scientific terms had only brief summary descriptions. The individual entries have a standard form: the definitions of concrete nouns consist of a single synonym, while abstract nouns have a larger number; homonyms from different parts are labelled as such, and participle forms are included in the entry for their infinitives unless there is a clear reason for placing them separately. Despite criticisms of the archaic Tuscan dialect is recorded, the Vocabulario became widely established both in Italy and abroad; its superiority over earlier lexicons lay primarily in the way it was organised, and in the large number of supporting quotations it provided for each entry, highly unusual in those days.Giovanni Grazzini, L'Accademia della crusca, Firenze, G. Civelli, 1968, p. 13. Second edition Frontispiece of the second edition (1623). The second edition, also edited by Bastiano de' Rossi, was published in Venice in 1623. It was largely a reprint of the first edition, with some added material from more recent authors such as Annibal Caro, Lorenzo de' Medici, Michelangelo, Claudio Tolomei, :it:Ludovico Martelli and :it:Bernardo Segni. It contained a greater number of abstract nouns than the first edition, and provided an improved approach to article structure, avoiding clumsy or inconvenient cross-references. Third edition The third edition was published in three volumes in Florence itself in 1691. It tried to take into account some of the criticisms levelled against the first edition. * it introduced the note va (\\"voce antica\\" = \\"obsolete term\\") to indicate words which were included because of their historical importance rather than because of their relevance as examples to follow * the list of authors used as sources for the entries was widened considerably and included more recent ones * the number of articles dealing with scientific terms was increased, using works such as Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems as sources. Francesco Redi did a lot of work in this field, although he also invented a fictitious source, one 'Sandro da Pippozzo', to support some of his entries). Other contributors included Lorenzo Magalotti and Prince Leopoldo de' Medici, who introduced entries related to hunting, military architecture and navy as a result of his own fieldwork. * suffixes and modified forms were added to them lemmas. * not all entries relied on author citations, meaning that effectively items were included on the simple authority of the Accademia della Crusca itself rather than on literary precedent. * numerous loanwords and terms in common use were included. Fourth edition The fourth edition came out in Florence in six volumes between 1729 and 1738, edited by :it:Domenico Maria Manni. The range of writers used as references was extended to include Iacopo Sannazaro, Benvenuto Cellini, Benedetto Menzini and. Lorenzo Lippi. In comparison with the previous edition: * a number of common words relating to farming were added, as were references to families of words * loan-words were included with author citations * questions of register and style were addressed * scientific terms borrowed from Latin or Greek were included * there was a much greater range of technical and scientific terms Fifth edition During the Napoleonic period Tuscany was ruled first as the Kingdom of Etruria and then annexed to France (1807‚Äì1814). During this time the official language of government was French. Nevertheless on 9 April 1809 Napoleon issued a decree allowing a Florentines to use their native language alongside French, in the courts, legal documents and private correspondence. In addition it announced the establishment of an annual prize of 500 napoleoni, to authors whose works best contributed to maintaining the Italian language in all its purity. A further decree on 9 January 1811 re-established the Accademia della Crusca and charged it specifically with revising the dictionary as well as with preserving the purity of the language. Academicians were to be paid an annual stipend of 500 franchi, or 1,000 francs if they were working on the dictionary, while 1,200 were provided for the secretary. Nevertheless the work remained incomplete: publication stopped after the letter \\"O\\", which ended when the entry for 'ozono' was reached in 1923. 20th century From 1955 the plan of work changed, and the aim became to produce a great historical dictionary that would include the 'treasures' of the Italian language. In 1965 the work of producing the historical dictionary was split off from the Accademia and a separate 'Opera del Vocabolario' was set up. A law of 6 January 1983 established the Opera del Vocabolario as an institute of the National Research Council, working on the language up to 1375, while the Accademia itself now focuses on the modern language.

She was born in 1968 in a town near Amsterdam, but it was the capital city where she has developed her career. She is known mostly for her vintage portraits of women in both her tattoos as well and her paintings. These works have now garnered an international cult following in popular culture, made up of people who love the artist almost as much as the work itself. Houtkamp‚Äôs artwork has appeared in a multitude of various art institutes, magazines, books, and tattoo shows over the years of her professional career as an artist. However, despite her artistic success, there was a period of twelve years where she worked an assortment of different occupations before she opened her own tattoo parlour and became a publicized artist.  Early life  Angelique Houtkamp was born in 1968 in a town just outside of Amsterdam called Uithoorn. She spent the years of her early life in an average education system until she decided to drop out in 1986 at the age of eighteen and move to Amsterdam. There, she expanded her experience in many different professions. She worked as a dressmaker, bartender, makeup artist, jewellery piercer, waitress, and as an administrator for a chain of sex shops. She also started up her own jewellery business when she was 23 called ‚ÄúGoldies‚Äù. Her personal life was just as interesting and diverse. Houtkamp was a member of two different Dutch bands: \\"Facehugger,\\" a death metal group for which she was the bassist, and another band named the \\"Slick Mechanics\\", where she played as a guitarist. She also starred as the character Rumpelstiltskin for a Dutch children‚Äôs movie named ‚ÄúEr Wasus‚Ä¶‚Äù. This was not the last time she appeared behind a camera. In 1998, Houtkamp developed her skill as a tattoo artist and a year later turned this into a full-time career, thus launching her popularity in the professional arts. In 2001, she appeared in numerous TV shows to speak about tattooing. After this, her art began to gain even more popularity and she established a place for her work in the fine art sphere.  Tattoo profession  Tattoo culture was never a clearly pronounced influence in the early years of Houtkamp‚Äôs life. The only interaction the artist had with the medium was with an old-fashioned snake-and-dagger tattoo that belonged to her uncle. Her uncle conceded his regrets towards getting the tattoo, but a young Houtkamp saw the mystic snake and ancient weapon as a fascinating aesthetic. Later in her life, Houtkamp‚Äôs interaction with tattoo culture became more prominent. After about twelve years of working a collection of odd jobs, she decided to learn tattooing in 1998. Only one year after this, she received a job tattooing at Tattoo Peter, one of the original tattoo parlours in Europe. The job at Tattoo Peter was a platform for Houtkamp to start her career. She later left Tattoo Peter and started her own parlour with the name Salon Serpent in Amsterdam, where she works alongside seven other artists. In the mind of Houtkamp, tattoos are connected with emotions pertaining to attraction, repellency, life, death, fear, and power. These motifs are made with vintage iconographs from old tattoo imagery and historical aesthetics. The popularity of Houtkamp‚Äôs skilled tattoos has captured the attention of multiple tattoo conventions, magazines, and art culture interviewers. Some of her more notable features are in articles of the publications of ITA and Penthouse, as well as Juxtapoz Art and Culture Magazine. She has also appeared at a variety of tattoo conventions and shows such as the London Tattoo Convention in 2012 and the exhibition at the Dva Gallery in Chicago in 2007.  Studio art profession  Angelique Houtkamp began painting studio art with oil and acrylic, but in 2009, she switched to watercolour, pen, and ink as her new personal medium of choice. Her watercolour pieces are her more popular works and have gained a large fan following. She was first a self-taught artist until she learned the skills of watercolour from the artist Theo Jak, who was a student under Henry Goldfield. The techniques she used were typically used to create flash images for tattoo ideas in parlours, but Houtkamp has adapted the images into prints that have extended out of the parlour and into gallery spaces. The act of transferring body art onto paper allows Houtkamp‚Äôs work to be more accessible to public viewers. Her prints have appeared in sold out shows around the world, including in the Nelly Duff Gallery in London and in a group show put together by curator Miss Van in Barcelona, as well as in an ongoing residency with Outr√© Gallery in Melbourne, Australia. Her paintings have also been used for magazines, postcards, clothing, and CD covers. The artist does not only limit herself to painting but works with sculptural mediums as well. From 2005 and onward, Houtkamp has made a collection of evocative skulls. The pieces are created by using the skull of a human embryo to make molds using Plaster of Paris. She then soaks the plaster in coffee to conjure a vintage look before applying oil paint in decorative motifs that connect the pieces to her tattoo aesthetic.  Artistic process and style  Houtkamp‚Äôs retro feminine images are devised from an assorted number of inspirations and artistic processes. The inspiration for her portraits comes from a varying number of antique aesthetics and from characteristics of Greek mythology to the Weimar Period, as well as from historic outsiders such as circuses, pirates, and gypsies. Her paintings and tattoos have also evoked a sentimentality for the 1920s flapper styles and pinup girls but with a femme fatale edge. The desired effect of her vintage motifs connects her art to themes of immortality, life, death, pop culture, and nostalgia. Her portraits have been described in many ways, from neo-femme to indirectly nostalgic to retro and vintage. Houtkamp‚Äôs portrayals have a tendency to resemble old school tattoo flash, such as her adaptations of the Wild West, old Hollywood, hybrid creatures, and nautical symbols, thus showing her paintings‚Äô connections to her tattoo profession. An aesthetic connection to tattoo is also seen in the bold lines used to outline her images which she shades in with a limited colour palette. These techniques create a vintage style that Houtkamp further emphasizes by browning her paper with a coffee wash. To brighten the images, she pays careful attention to the effects of light on her figures that allow them to stand out of their antiquated visage. Houtkamp‚Äôs process for making her paintings starts with a hand drawing of her design. She then scans the image and adjusts proportions and lines using Photoshop, while also using the program to plan out the painting‚Äôs colour scheme and lighting composition. Before the genesis of this technology, Houtkamp would scan her images and, using a photocopier, copy and paste her images to create the desired outcome. Now, when she has completed her first draft of the image, she uses her artistic blueprint to hand paint the final product. To provide gallery accessible pieces, she creates a copy using giclee printing technology to obtain the best resolution for resale showing her watercolour methods.  Other commitments and personal ventures  Houtkamp‚Äôs growing profession in the arts is not only attributed to her studio art and tattoo art. She has engaged in a multitude of various other professional and personal commitments that have increased her visibility. Through her partnership with Outr√© Gallery in Melbourne, Australia, Houtkamp has had two monographs published about her and her work. The first is ‚ÄúTattoo Darling: The Art of Angelique Houtkamp‚Äù, published in 2007, and the second is ‚ÄúTattoo Mystique: The Art and World of Angelique Houtkamp‚Äù, published in 2009. She is also featured in Outr√©‚Äôs publication of ‚ÄúTattoo Parlour: Artists from the World of Tattoo‚Äù. Other art and culture publications have also picked up the artist‚Äôs talent, including Juxtapoz Art and Culture Magazine, which published a feature of Houtkamp and her work in the book ‚ÄúJuxtapoz Tattoo 2‚Äù. Extending her artistic creativity to other media, the artist has taken her talents to other entrepreneur ventures. She has started up her own greeting card collection named ‚ÄúDearest Darling‚Äù and in 2004, she co-designed a bag and shoe line called ‚ÄúHelena-Angelique‚Äù. A year after this, she took her talents to a Dutch wallpaper company where she designed arrangements for the products. Houtkamp‚Äôs crafty inventions are seen to be mirrored in her everyday life, which is surrounded by a world of vintage ephemera. The personal style of the artist mimics the retro yet modern edged aesthetic of her portraits, made apparent by her fashion and abundance of tattoos. The personality and countenance of Houtkamp is part of what makes her art so relatable and what makes so many members of her audience connect with both her style and her artwork.

McDowell) (1925 ‚Äì November 4, 2013) was a professor of thermodynamics and cryogenics. She was the first woman to earn a mechanical engineering PhD in the United States. Graham is remembered for her lifelong work recruiting young women into careers in science and engineering. She taught for nearly 40 years in the Illinois Institute of Technology's Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace Engineering program. Graham founded IIT's Women in Science and Engineering program, which recruited female high school students into science and engineering careers.  Early life and education  Graham was born in 1925 and grew up in Troy, NY, one of three siblings. She initially wanted to be a doctor but could not afford medical school. An admirer of Amelia Earhart, Graham also wanted to be a pilot or flight attendant, but those professions at the time had height limitations of 5'3\\" and weight limitations of 125 pounds. \\"Well, unfortunately,\\" Graham said in an interview, \\"I outgrew that career.\\" Interested in aviation, Graham considered aerospace engineering, but as with medical school, she could not afford the tuition. = Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute = By the time she graduated from high school in the spring of 1942, Graham had settled on attending a state college for teachers in nearby Albany, NY. That summer, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), where Graham's father taught, announced that it would admit female students for the first time, and children of employees could attend for free. Graham enrolled, first attending summer classes, and then enrolling full-time, one of the first four women to be admitted. She followed an accelerated schedule that was available during World War II. Graham became one of the first two women to graduate with a degree at RPI (Class of 1946), and the first woman from the university to graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering. = Illinois Institute of Technology = After graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Graham worked as a test engineer at the Carrier Corporation, leaving after 18 months to pursue a master's degree. According to Graham, she was turned away by MIT (who requested \\"every single textbook I had used when I was in college and every portion of that textbook I had covered\\"), CalTech (who sent her a postcard stating, \\"We do not accept women\\"), and the University of Illinois (who told her, \\"we cannot accept out-of-state students at this time\\"), but was offered a teaching assistantship by the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). = Degrees awarded = *Bachelor of Science, Mechanical Engineering (B.S.ME), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 1946 *Master of Science, Mechanical Engineering (M.S.ME), Illinois Institute of Technology, 1949 *Doctor of Philosophy, Mechanical Engineering (Ph.D.ME), Illinois Institute of Technology, 1959  Career  left In 1949, Graham became the first female faculty member in IIT's engineering department, and the first female graduate student accepted into its Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace Engineering program. IIT had to make an adjustment upon her arrival: converting a small closet into a ladies restroom. Later that year, Graham earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering, the first woman at IIT to do so. Even early in her career, Graham received attention for being a woman in a male-dominated field. In September 1953, Graham was featured in Popular Science, which ran a picture of her, identified as \\"Lois G. McDowell,\\" with the caption: Alt URL = SWE and Women in Engineering = 1953 Society of Women Engineers board meeting; Lois Graham is standing, on the rightGraham was a fellow life member of the Society of Women Engineers, which she joined in 1952, two years after it was founded. At SWE, Graham's worked focused on increasing the number of women pursuing careers in engineering, science, and math. She wrote articles published by SWE advocating for improving the career counseling available to young women, and for increasing the recruitment of young women into the engineering field in order to end a shortage of engineers in the country. To bolster her arguments, Graham marshaled allies by citing other influential people from outside academia who had spoken favorably about women in engineering. For example, in one article, Graham employed a quote by Arthur Sherwood Flemming (then the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization, and later US President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare), in which he said, \\"[W]e haven't got a chance in the world of taking care of that deficit of engineers... unless we get women headed in the direction of engineering schools.\\" Graham argued that young women could not only help themselves, but also help their country, by pursuing careers in engineering. Graham served as SWE's fourth national president from 1955 until 1956. In 1955, SWE released a 40-page report entitled Women in Engineering, aimed at influencing how female engineers were viewed by the public. Graham has said in an interview that an early title under consideration for the booklet was \\"Petticoats and Slide Rules.\\" The report listed accredited engineering programs, their curricula and prerequisites. It also included information about scholarships for women, statistics about women in the engineering field, and suggested reading lists. SWE distributed the Women in Engineering booklet to over 400 high schools around the United States, as well as colleges and universities, corporations and government agencies, and engineering societies. Ultimately, the enthusiastic response led to SWE running out of copies of Women in Engineering, and a new edition was issued in 1958. = First woman in US to earn mechanical engineering PhD = In 1959, Graham was awarded a PhD by IIT and became the first US woman to earn a mechanical engineering PhD. Her doctoral work focused on the field of combustion, and her dissertation thesis was entitled Effect of adding a combustible to atmosphere and surrounding diffusion flame. In 1974, Graham became assistant director for Engineering and Science. The following year, she was promoted to full professor, a rare rank for a woman to hold at the time. In 1977, she was named Program Director for IIT's Education and Experience in Engineering Program. She also served as the Director of IIT's Minorities in Engineering Program. In 1979, she was listed as a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow. In 1980, she received the IIT Professional Achievement Award, and in 1991, the IIT Julie Beveridge Award. = IIT's Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Program = In 1981, Graham founded IIT's Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program. WISE employed women engineers in the private, public, and academic sectors, as well as graduate and undergraduate students, to engage directly with female high school students in order to increase enrollment of women into college engineering programs. WISE had a three-prong approach: encouraging high school girls in a supportive environment to pursue what are today termed STEM careers; engaging them in hands-on activities that expose them to various math- and science- related fields; and preparing them to pursue an undergraduate engineering degree by advising on course selection, college applications, and similar matters. Fall, winter, and summer programs were offered, usually free of charge, in which female high school students attended college lectures, networked with engineering students, faculty, and professionals, and participated in hands-on projects inside and outside of the laboratory, such as building a generator or planning a moon colony. WISE also educated parents, teachers, and counselors about the opportunities available to young women to pursue math and science careers.  Retirement  After 39 years at IIT, Graham retired in 1985 and moved back to upstate New York. On December 8, 1999, Graham was awarded the Person of the Millennium award by IIT students, an award, Graham said, she \\"prized above all others.\\" On June 6, 2003, Graham was interviewed for SWE's Oral History Project. On September 19, 2003, Graham was inducted to the RPI Hall of Fame. Graham died on November 4, 2013, at the age of 88. An obituary in Watertown Daily Times wrote, \\"To her beloved grandchildren she was simply 'Grandma Lois.' But to thousands of female mechanical engineers in this country, she was a pioneer and role model.\\" In 2010‚Äì2011, Graham was an American Association of University Women named scholarship honoree. She was also nominated to be a National Women's History Project National Women's History Month honoree in 2013. In 2015, Graham was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by IIT.  Impact and legacy  A 2007 article published in the International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education entitled Outstanding Women in Mechanical Engineering described Graham as, \\"Recognised for her contributions as an educator to thermodynamics and cryogenics.\\" RPI has written that Graham's \\"academic and professional career paved the way for women and minority engineers.\\" IIT has described her as a \\"pioneer in the field of mechanical engineering.\\"A student of Graham's, Sherita Caesar, was awarded the 2014 Women in Technology Award by the Women in Cable Telecommunications (WICT), the Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE), and Cablefax. An IIT publication announcing the award stated that Caesar was \\"inspired\\" by Graham, who \\"encouraged Caesar to teach others and give to others in order to help her overcome her fear of presenting her master's thesis.\\" Graham has also been credited for her work at SWE and ASHRAE (where she was the first woman fellow) to improve career counseling available to young women, and for her recruitment of young women into science and engineering fields. = Awards, honors, and memberships = * Fellow Life Member and National President (1955‚Äì1956), Society of Women Engineers (SWE) *National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow (1979) *Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) Professional Achievement Award (1980) * IIT Julie Beveridge Award (1991) * IIT Person of the Millenium (1999) *Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Hall of Fame (2003) *American Association of University Women Named Scholarship Honoree (2010‚Äì2011) *Nominee, National Women's History Project National Women's History Month Honoree (2013) * IIT Lifetime Achievement Award (2015) * First female Fellow, American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) * Member, American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) * Member, American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) *Member, American Association of University Women (AAUW) *Member, Phi Tau Sigma *Member, Tau Beta Pi *Member, Sigma Xi = Support for arts, education and nature conservation = Graham's obituary stated that she was a \\"supporter of the arts, education and nature conservation,\\" and that in the late 1990s, Graham and her husband became charter members of The Wild Center in New York (a 2015 finalist for the National Medal for Museum and Library Service).

Born in an Irish Catholic family in Cork, Mathew was educated at the largely Protestant Trinity College, Dublin, before joining the English bar. In 1881, although still a junior barrister, he was appointed to the High Court of Justice, where he sat in the Queen's Bench Division and was said to be the best nisi prius judge of his time. He was promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1901, before resigned from the bench due to health reasons in 1905. Mathew was a driving force behind the creation of Commercial List in 1895, the forerunner of the modern Commercial Court, and was the first judge in charge of the List.  Early life and education  Mathew was born at Lehenagh House, Cork, on 10 July 1830, the eldest son of Charles Mathew by his wife Mary, daughter of James Hackett of Cork. The Temperance campaigner Father Theobald Mathew was his uncle, and it was largely due to his representations that the nephew, after receiving his early education at a private school at Cork, was sent at the age of fifteen to Trinity College, Dublin, an unusual step at that period for a member of a Catholic family. He graduated as senior moderator and gold medallist in 1850, then entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn on 1 June 1851, and read in the chamber of Thomas Chitty. He was called to the bar in Hilary term 1851, having obtained in the previous November an open studentship. He was made a bencher in Easter term 1881.  Career at the bar  For some ten years his progress was very slow. In the meantime he found scope for his debating and argumentative powers at the Hardwicke Society, of which he was one of the founders; and the humour and sarcasm which never forsook him brought him into prominence at the social gatherings of the Home Circuit mess. When business at last came to him, it found him thoroughly versed in the intricacies of pleading and practice and ready to seize every opportunity. He had a strong natural aptitude for the practical side of law, and from the outset of his career at the bar he showed impatience of technicalities and determination to get at the real points at issue. His services were in especial demand at the now defunct Guildhall sittings, where the heavy City special jury cases were tried, and after the way was cleared by Arthur Cohen being made a Queen's Counsel in 1874, Mathew and Charles Bowen were invariably retained by one side or the other; but in spite of his vast practice as a junior, Mathew steadily refrained from applying to become a QC: a weak and rather harsh voice may have rendered him distrustful of his powers as a leader. In 1873 he was among the treasury counsel on the prosecution of the Tichborne claimant, Arthur Orton, and he was the only one of his opponents with whom Edward Kenealy did not quarrel.  Judicial career  In March 1881, though still a junior barrister, he was appointed a judge in the Queen's Bench Division and knighted. At first he was hardly the success on the bench that his friends had predicted. He was often over hasty in speech, and he showed himself too impatient of slowness and dulness. These defects, however, wore away, and he became eventually the best nisi prius judge of his time. On the criminal side, though his previous experience in that branch of the profession was small, he showed acuteness and broad common sense, with occasionally, as was observed, a slight leaning to the prisoner. But it is by the institution of the commercial court that he will be best remembered. He had always held strong views on the question of costs and of legal procedure, and shortly before his elevation to the bench he had served on a royal commission appointed to inquire into the former subject. = Creation of the Commercial Court = In 1895 he persuaded the other judges of the Queen's Bench Division, in which Lord Russell of Killowen had just been appointed Chief Justice, to assent to the formation of a special list for commercial cases to be heard in a particular court, presided over by the same judge sitting continuously and with a free hand as to his own procedure. Of this office Mathew was the first and by far the most successful occupant. He swept away written pleadings, narrowed the issues to the smallest possible dimensions, and allowed no dilatory excuses to interfere with the speedy trial of the action. His own judgments, ‚Äòconcise and terse, free from irrelevancies and digression,‚Äô won the approval of all who practised in the court, and the confidence of the mercantile community. To a man of Mathew's alert, energetic, and radical mind the procedure in Chancery, especially in chambers, seemed a cumbersome survival of medievalism; and when sitting occasionally as a chancery judge he tried to introduce some of the reforms he had found efficacious in the commercial court. But the soil was not congenial, and some of his criticisms caused a good deal of umbrage to the members of the Chancery bar. = Royal Commissioner = Shortly after the return of the Liberal Party to office in August 1892, Mathew was made chairman of a royal commission appointed to inquire into the case of the evicted tenants in Ireland, with especial reference to their reinstatement and resettlement. The selection was not very fortunate. As a convinced home ruler and the father-in-law of John Dillon, a leading Nationalist MP, he was regarded with distrust by the landlords and the Unionists generally. The opening day, 7 November was marked by a disagreeable altercation between the chairman and Edward Carson. Following the example of Sir John Day at Belfast, Mathew refused to allow cross-examination by counsel. Carson thereupon stigmatised the inquiry as 'a sham and a farce,' and Mathew pronounced this observation to be 'impertinent and disgraceful to the Irish bar.' Counsel were ordered to withdraw, two of the chairman's colleagues took speedy opportunity of resigning, and the landlords as a body refused to take any further part in the proceedings. The commission, however, continued to take evidence, and reported in due course; some of its recommendations bore fruit in the clauses of George Wyndham's Land Purchase (Ireland) Act (1903). It should be said that the lines of procedure laid down by Mathew have been consistently followed in subsequent royal commissions. = Court of Appeal and death = Probably owing to this episode Mathew was not raised to the Court of Appeal until 1901. In his new capacity he displayed all his old qualities of accuracy, common sense, and vigour, but he deprecated elaborate arguments and voluminous citation of authorities, the 'old umbrellas of the law,' as he used to call them. On 6 December 1905 he was seized with a paralytic stroke at the Athen√¶um Club, and his resignation was announced on the following day. He died in London on 9 November 1908, and was buried in St. Joseph's Cemetery at Cork. = Assessment = In many respects Mathew was a typical representative of the south of Ireland. Ready and facile of speech, he was gifted with a delightful flow of humour and a strong appreciation of the lighter side of life. An ardent radical and a devout Roman Catholic, he maintained the happiest relations with many who were vehemently opposed to him in religion and politics; on circuit he was always a welcome visitor at the houses of the dignitaries of the Church of England. A man of wide reading and culture, he was a warm-hearted and faithful friend.  Family  Mathew married on 26 December 1861 Elizabeth, daughter of Edwin Biron, vicar of Lympne near Hythe; she survived him. There were two sons and three daughters of the marriage. His eldest daughter Elizabeth married in 1895 the Irish MP John Dillon, and was the mother of the Irish politician James Matthew Dillon. Both of Mathew's sons became barristers. The elder, Theobald Mathew, was a well-known legal wit, while the younger, Charles Mathew KC, was briefly a Labour MP. Charles Mathew's son, Sir Theobald Mathew, was the longest-serving Director of Public Prosecutions.

This project was first initiated by Waterfront Toronto in 2017 by issuing the request for proposal (RFP) on development of the Quayside area. Sidewalk Labs, which is a subsidiary company of Alphabet Inc. and a sister company of Google, won the bid in 2017. The Master Innovation Development Plan (MIDP) was created in 2019 through conversations with over 21,000 Torontonians and aimed to be an innovative reinvention of Toronto's neglected eastern downtown waterfront. Alphabet announced the cancellation of the project on May 7, 2020.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sidewalk-labs-cancels- project-1.5559370 Sidewalk Toronto had aimed to utilize technology to create a smart urban area that improves the quality of life of its residents, also using it as a testing ground for future urban design projects and technology. The high-tech plan drew criticism, mainly over data privacy issues regarding the robust data collection in the proposed community. Alphabet cited economic concerns caused by the uncertainty of the economy experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic.  History = Request for proposal (2017) = Waterfront Toronto holds the right to develop the eastern downtown area of the Toronto waterfront, as the directing agency of the waterfront lands. In March 2017, Waterfront Toronto issued a request for proposal (RFP) to solicit bids for the development of mixed-use mixed-income project called the Quayside development. The development was envisioned as a pilot project for Toronto's future urban planning as a world-class city. The RFP set objectives to meet C40 Climate Positive sustainability, test cleantech building materials, provide 500‚Äì800 units of affordable rental housing, establish a complete community with open public spaces and strong links to adjacent neighbourhoods, develop information infrastructures to aid decision-making and attract innovative businesses and talent, and secure funding and investment partnerships. The innovation partner is expected to invest from short-term pre-development research to long-term investments in infrastructure and pilot projects. Sidewalk Labs won the RFP in October 2017 and officially launched Sidewalk Toronto. According to their press release, their plan is to \\"design a new kind of mixed-use, complete community\\" and apply new digital technology to \\"create people-centered neighborhoods\\". Sidewalk Labs committed million to test pilot projects and planned to relocate Google's Canadian headquarters to Quayside. They began working on a Master Innovation and Development Plan (MIDP) to form the basis for the Quayside development. Sidewalk Labs' bid had proposed features such as roads optimized for self-driving vehicles, creation of a testbed for developing future urban planning ideas, and fully integrated physical and digital layers of the urban system. As envisioned, this digital layer would make the physical infrastructure ‚Äì buildings, transportation infrastructure, utility infrastructure, and public realm ‚Äì more adaptable and efficient, it would manage a repository of data and provide an application programming interface for third-party developers.  Development plan  In the agreement between Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs, they established eleven different \\"pillars\\" to develop the plan: * Mobility: A mixed mobility environment where motor traffic can be mixed with cycling and walking * Public realm: Stimulating public activity to deliver a more usable and enjoyable public spaces * Buildings: Creating adaptable and flexible building modules * Community & city services: Connecting people through digital technologies that allow them to communicate better and empower the community * Sustainability: Creating climate-positive communities that pursue negative carbon emission. * Digital platform: Creating a digital layer that can be integrated with the physical layer from the first place. * Privacy & data governance: Creating robust use-cases of data governance and considering privacy as a major concern. * Pilots/early actions: Research and development pilots and technology use-cases to collect long-term vision of Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs. * Housing Affordability: Provisioning adequate affordable housing units in Quayside and creating a mixed-used income community. * Economic development & urban innovation institute: Establishing an urban innovation institute to foster job creation and economic development of the Quayside area. * Development & planning: Creating a \\"pillar\\" initiative to foster integrated planning in the development process. A public engagement plan sought feedback from Torontonians through a series of public talks and roundtable meetings, engagement in design, and online engagment. Additionally, Sidewalk Labs had established its own core principles to guide its projects: * No tech for tech's sake: To not highlight the technology side of urban development, being \\"interested only if it has a clear impact on solving urban problems and realizing the promise of dense urban communities\\". * Respect privacy: As a central matter, they introduced the privacy by design framework of Ann Cavoukian to account for privacy throughout the design and building process. * Believe open standards: Using open standards which enable diverse stakeholders to easily access data and technology. * Strength through diversity: Considering the demographic diversity of Toronto to promote a concept of \\"complete communities.\\" * We cannot do this alone: Engaging in continuous discussions with stakeholders to improve the process and gain support. = Sidewalk RFP submission = Sidewalk Labs' RFP submission envisioned urban planning in five layers. These were the physical layers of utility infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, the public realm and buildings, plus a digital layer which enabled the physical layers to be more efficient and adaptable. According to the proposal: *Utility channels below the public spaces would house conduits for electric wires, waste, and water, and allow access for maintenance without disrupting roadways or public spaces.

A system of embedded sensors providing real-time monitoring and automated regulation would allow the zoning code in the mixed-use environment to be changed dynamically, according to criteria such as maximum noise level or air quality. *Transportation infrastructure is planned around adaptive roads and street lights.

However, because Sidewalk Labs' parent company is owned by Alphabet Inc., a giant technology company and produces profits using internet traffic-related advertisement, there have been numerous critics concerned of Orwellian privacy control. As a result of continuous criticism about the privacy of residents and commodification of data collection, Sidewalk Labs shifted their direction for constructing the digital layer, introducing the concept of a civic data trust. In an October 2018 press release, Sidewalk Labs renounced the right to own information generated from Quayside. The release argued that \\"urban data\\" ‚Äì community data de-identified of personal information ‚Äì should be considered as a public asset and be freely available. They proposed that the data should be owned and managed by an independent civic data trust, which would steward the data collected in the physical layers of the planned development, and approve and control its collection and dissemination. The proposed trust would be guided by a charter ensuring that data is collected and used in a way that is beneficial to the community, protects privacy, and spurs innovation and investment. If a company wanted to collect or use the data for more proprietary or commercial purposes, or it required personally-identifiable information, approval should be required from the trust. Sidewalk Labs provided examples of data repositories in other cities: In Barcelona, collected data is pooled into a central repository and access is managed by the city; in Estonia, companies store their own collected data but make it available via standardized protocols. = Data governance = In November 2019, Sidewalk Labs delivered a Digital Innovation Appendix\\" to provide real-world examples and flesh out data governance plans for the project, including \\"responsible artificial intelligence\\" guidelines and data minimization and de-identification by default. They also incorporated feedback giving Waterfront Toronto the lead on data governance, rather than an independent Urban Data Trust. In February 2020, Waterfront Toronto endorsed 144 of 160 innovation proposals from Sidewalk Labs, saying the other 16 could be dropped, altered or replaced. Waterfront Toronto's advisory panel said it was premature to provide advice, and still had questions about the feasibility of some innovations proposed within the project. They wanted more clarity on the benefits that might justify the proposed collection and use of data. They requested additional context for Sidewalk Toronto's earlier allegations regarding data security. A final decision on whether the project can proceed was pushed back from March 2020 to June 25. = Criticisms = According to open-government advocate Bianca Wylie, the fundamental problem of this project is the smart city model itself. She argues that the model is formulated because \\"corporations are seeking to exert influence on urban spaces and democratic governance\\". She claims that not just Sidewalk Labs, but elected officials and politicians of Toronto considered the plan as a way of boosting the economy and brand the city as a world leader supported by a leading tech company. Moreover, she argues that these kinds of development projects, especially digital government projects, have been considered as stable financial revenue for the companies involved. By embedding a technical product in a government system, it would be extremely difficult to pull out from the system, thus making the government market highly attractive. There have also been various criticisms about the proposed civic data trust. Opposing the argument that de-identified data is safe to be publicly available, a study published in Science has found that de- identified data can be de-anonymized when a dataset is associated with different datasets. Even if the data does remain de-identifiable, the question of data ownership remains; only the managing entity was changed. If a company gained access to that public data, then only the company would earn the revenue. The producers of the data are external to those considerations. In November 2019, in response to feedback, the proposal for data governance was shifted from recommending an independent Urban Data Trust, to vesting authority in the existing Waterfront Toronto government partnership.

Early life  Grace Ibingira was born on 23 May 1932 in Ibanda County, Ankole District, Uganda Protectorate. His father, Alfred Katebarirwe, was a Gombolola chief. From 1942 until 1950 he attended Mbarara High School. The following year he enrolled in King's College Budo. He graduated in 1953 with a grade one Cambridge School Certificate. Subsequently taking up the study of law, he graduated in 1958 magna cum laude from the University College Wales, Aberystwyth. Ibingira finished his studies in 1959 with a year of postgraduate work at the University of London. He was then called to the bar by Middle Temple, being listed as a barrister of the Supreme Court of England. That same year he went to Kampala to serve as an advocate for the Uganda High Court. Political career = Entry into politics = For a time, Ibingira served as the legal adviser for the Uganda People's Congress (UPC), a political party. Throughout his political career, Ibingira was primarily preoccupied by gaining power. He was vague about his beliefs, and only publicly committed himself to ones that had widespread acceptance. Instead of garnering popular appeal, he advanced his position through negotiations and private discussions with other leaders. His political support derived from four areas: the UPC political machine based in Ankole, southern municipal and district politicians who felt threatened by UPC leader Milton Obote's populist appeal, conservative intellectuals who found Obote's image drab and unimpressive, and Edward Mutesa, the Kabaka (king) of Buganda. = Ugandan independence = Ibingira played an important role in determining the look of the Flag of Uganda (pictured). Ibingira was elected to the Uganda Legislative Council in 1960 by the Ankole Eishengyero (district council). The Democratic Party (DP) won a majority in Uganda's first free national elections in 1961, and formed a government. The UPC members and traditionalist Baganda disliked the Catholic orientation of the DP, but were diametrically opposed to each others' ideals. Despite this, Ibingira was given the responsibility of making contact with the Baganda to establish an alliance. The UPC chose him for the role because he was personally acquainted with Mutesa. After several negotiations, the UPC and Baganda leaders held a conference whereupon an agreement was reached. Soon afterwards the Baganda created the Kabaka Yekka (KY), a traditionalist party that entered an alliance with the UPC. Following the UPC's victory in the April 1962 general elections, Obote was tasked with forming a government. He chose Ibingira to serve as Minister of Justice. Ibingira also played an influential role in determining the look of the Flag of Uganda, chairing a committee charged with drafting a design and suggesting that the standard be modeled off of the West German Flag. Uganda became independent on 9 October 1962. = Rivalry with Obote = From left to right: Ibingira, Milton Obote, and John Kakonge in 1962 Ibingira felt that Obote was not educated enough to serve as Prime Minister of Uganda and believed that he had been given the position solely because of his anti-colonial rhetoric. In 1964 Ibingira initiated a struggle to gain control of the UPC with the ultimate goal of deposing Obote from the party presidency. At a party conference in April he challenged John Kakonge for the secretariat-general of the UPC. He convinced Obote that Kakonge posed a threat to his leadership of the UPC. With Obote's support, Ibingira ousted Kakonge by two votes. He used his new position to purge the party of a number of leftists and endorsed the abolition of the UPC Youth League. Meanwhile, Mutesa increasingly feared that the UPC would deny his kingdom its traditional autonomy. He concluded that in order to retain power he would have to garner influence in national politics. Mutesa proceeded to instruct Baganda MPs to join the UPC with the goal of bolstering Ibingira's position and unseating Obote, thus allowing for a reorientation of the UPC-KY alliance that would be more favorable to Buganda. As his working relationship with Mutesa improved, Ibingira amassed a coalition of non-Baganda southerners, dubbed the \\"Bantu Group\\". In December 1964 he, under the cover checking on his ranch in Ankole, traveled to the United States to raise funds to support anti-socialist causes. Upon his return, he successfully used the money to expand his following. The following year Ibingira played a key role in passing an amendment to the Police Ordinance through Parliament that allowed the police to disperse any public meeting or assembly. By then it was apparent that the UPC had divided into an Ibingira- led wing and an Obote-led wing. When Ibingira attempted to convene a UPC conference in his capacity as party secretary general, the police‚Äîacting under the authority of the new statute‚Äîshut it down. In early 1966 a banker leaked the financial records of Idi Amin, a soldier in the Ugandan army who had close ties with Prime Minister Obote. The documents implicated Amin in illicit gold trafficking along the Democratic Republic of the Congo border. A motion tabled in Parliament charged Amin with corruption and accused Obote of being complicit in his actions. The UPC resolved to reject it. However, on 4 February, while Obote was away from Kampala, the capital, Ibingira convinced the cabinet to recognise the complaint. When Obote returned eleven days later, he was unable to dissuade his ministers from proceeding with an investigation. The cabinet attempted to convene on 22 February to appoint a commission of inquiry into the matter, but Obote had the police interrupt the meeting and place Ibingira and four other ministers under arrest. They were transferred to Karamoja as per a colonial law that allowed for the detention and removal of \\"undesirable\\" persons. Ibingira and the ministers petitioned the courts for a writ of habeas corpus. A Uganda High Court judge found the detention legal and denied the petition, but the East African Court of Appeal ruled that the relevant law violated a Ugandan citizen's constitutional right to freedom of movement and ordered a writ of habeas corpus to be granted. Ibingira and his colleagues were immediately rearrested outside the court in Baganda under the colonial Emergency Regulations and the government passed the Deportation Act to cover its actions. Ibingira and the other ministers filed a new suit, but in a hearing the court affirmed the legality of the new law. = Post-Obote career = On 25 January 1971 Amin launched a military coup, ousting Obote and seizing power. He released Ibingira along with 54 other political prisoners and appointed him Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations. Ibingira later went into exile. When a Tanzanian invasion threatened the Ugandan regime, he promoted Yusuf Lule as a potential successor to Amin. Ibingira attended the Moshi Conference in March 1979 where Ugandan exiles elected Lule to succeed Amin once he was deposed. Lule appointed Ibingira Minister of Information on 7 June 1979. His addition to the cabinet particularly upset the National Consultative Committee. On 19 June Lule removed Ibingira from his cabinet and made him Ambassador to the UN. In 1980 Ibingira published a book, entitled, African Upheavals since Independence. He died in December 1995.

Both birds shared more osteological characteristics with the Eurasian woodcock (S. rusticola) than the American woodcock (S. minor). It was described from Trouing Jean Paul, a late Holocene limestone cave in Haiti, and was the fourth most common species in the fossil assemblage collected from it.

Thus, S. brachycarpa may have survived the Amerindian colonization of Hispaniola and possibly even into the European colonization of the island, as scientific knowledge of the island's avifauna did not rigorously start until the 19th century, at which point S. brachycarpa may have been already wiped out by invasive species.

Products include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product. It most commonly refers to the open-source model, in which open-source software or other products are released under an open-source license as part of the open-source-software movement. Use of the term originated with software, but has expanded beyond the software sector to cover other open content and forms of open collaboration.  Origins  The term \\"open source\\", as used to describe software, was first proposed by a group of people in the free software movement who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term \\"free software\\" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position. Moreover, the ambiguity of the term \\"free software\\" was seen as discouraging business adoption. The group included Christine Peterson, Todd Anderson, Larry Augustin, Jon Hall, Sam Ockman, Michael Tiemann and Eric S. Raymond. Peterson suggested \\"open source\\" at a meeting held at Palo Alto, California, in reaction to Netscape's announcement in January 1998 of a source code release for Navigator. Linus Torvalds gave his support the following day, and Phil Hughes backed the term in Linux Journal. Richard Stallman, the founder of the free software movement, initially seemed to adopt the term, but later changed his mind. Netscape released its source code under the Netscape Public License and later under the Mozilla Public License. Raymond was especially active in the effort to popularize the new term. He made the first public call to the free software community to adopt it in February 1998. Shortly after, he founded The Open Source Initiative in collaboration with Bruce Perens. The term gained further visibility through an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly. Originally titled the \\"Freeware Summit\\" and later known as the \\"Open Source Summit\\", the event was attended by the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Eric Allman, Guido van Rossum, Michael Tiemann, Paul Vixie, Jamie Zawinski, and Eric Raymond. At the meeting, alternatives to the term \\"free software\\" were discussed. Tiemann advocated \\"sourceware\\" as a new term, while Raymond argued for \\"open source\\". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference the same evening. Many large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the open-source software movement, including the Apache Software Foundation, which supports community projects such as the open-source framework Apache Hadoop and the open-source HTTP server Apache HTTP. = The open-source model and open collaboration = The open-source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration,Levine, Sheen S., & Prietula, M. J. (2013). Open Collaboration for Innovation: Principles and Performance. Organization Science, meaning \\"any system of innovation or production that relies on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants who interact to create a product (or service) of economic value, which they make available to contributors and noncontributors alike.\\" A main principle of open-source software development is peer production, with products such as source code, blueprints, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code. The model is used for projects such as in open-source appropriate technology, and open-source drug discovery.\\"Science 2.0 is here as CSIR resorts to open-source drug research for TB\\" Business Standard, 1 March 2009\\"Open Source Drug Discovery for Malaria Consortium The open-source model for software development inspired the use of the term to refer to other forms of open collaboration, such as in Internet forums,Lakhani, Karim R., & von Hippel, Eric (2003).

Organization Science, 22(5), 1224-1239, Open collaboration is also thought to be the operating principle underlining a gamut of diverse ventures, including TEDx and Wikipedia. Open collaboration is the principle underlying peer production, mass collaboration, and wikinomics. It was observed initially in open source software, but can also be found in many other instances, such as in Internet forums, mailing lists, Internet communities, and many instances of open content, such as Creative Commons. It also explains some instances of crowdsourcing, collaborative consumption, and open innovation. Riehle et al. define open collaboration as collaboration based on three principles of egalitarianism, meritocracy, and self- organization. Levine and Prietula define open collaboration as \\"any system of innovation or production that relies on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants who interact to create a product (or service) of economic value, which they make available to contributors and noncontributors alike.\\" This definition captures multiple instances, all joined by similar principles. For example, all of the elements ‚Äî goods of economic value, open access to contribute and consume, interaction and exchange, purposeful yet loosely coordinated work ‚Äî are present in an open source software project, in Wikipedia, or in a user forum or community. They can also be present in a commercial website that is based on user-generated content. In all of these instances of open collaboration, anyone can contribute and anyone can freely partake in the fruits of sharing, which are produced by interacting participants who are loosely coordinated. An annual conference dedicated to the research and practice of open collaboration is the International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration (OpenSym, formerly WikiSym). As per its website, the group defines open collaboration as \\"collaboration that is egalitarian (everyone can join, no principled or artificial barriers to participation exist), meritocratic (decisions and status are merit-based rather than imposed) and self-organizing (processes adapt to people rather than people adapt to pre-defined processes).\\" = Open-source license = Open source promotes universal access via an open-source or free license to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint. Before the phrase open source became widely adopted, developers and producers used a variety of other terms. Open source gained hold in part due to the rise of the Internet. The open-source software movement arose to clarify copyright, licensing, domain, and consumer issues. An open-source license is a type of license for computer software and other products that allows the source code, blueprint or design to be used, modified or shared (with or without modification) under defined terms and conditions. This allows end users and commercial companies to review and modify the source code, blueprint or design for their own customization, curiosity or troubleshooting needs. Open-source licensed software is mostly available free of charge, though this does not necessarily have to be the case. Licenses which only permit non-commercial redistribution or modification of the source code for personal use only are generally not considered as open-source licenses. However, open-source licenses may have some restrictions, particularly regarding the expression of respect to the origin of software, such as a requirement to preserve the name of the authors and a copyright statement within the code, or a requirement to redistribute the licensed software only under the same license (as in a copyleft license). One popular set of open- source software licenses are those approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) based on their Open Source Definition (OSD). = Open-source software code = Generally, open source refers to a computer program in which the source code is available to the general public for use for any (including commercial) purpose, or modification from its original design. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community. Code is released under the terms of a software license. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community. = \\"Open\\" versus \\"free\\" versus \\"free and open\\" = Free and open-source software (FOSS) or Free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS) is openly shared source code that is licensed without any restrictions on usage, modification, or distribution. Confusion persists about this definition because the \\"Free\\", also known as \\"Libre\\", refers to the freedom of the product not the price, expense, cost, or charge. For example, \\"being free to speak\\" is not the same as \\"free beer\\".

It is one of the oldest dinosaurs known. Discovery Macrocollum was discovered in southern Brazil, in the Wachholz site, in 2012, and announced in a press conference on Wednesday, November 21, 2018. The generic name combines the Greek word ŒºŒ±Œ∫œÅœåœÇ (long) and the Latin word collum (neck), referring to the animal's elongated neck. The specific epithet honours Jos√© Jerundino Machado Itaqui, one of the main persons behind the creation of CAPPA/UFSM. Description Like most early dinosaurs, Macrocollum was relatively small, and walked on two legs. It was only long, tall, and weighed about . Skeletal reconstruction of Macrocollum itaquii. Known elements in white and unknown in dark gray. The known remains of Macrocollum are relatively well preserved. The holotype specimen consists of an almost complete and articulated skeleton. The two paratype specimens are both articulated skeletons with one missing a skull and its cervical series. Macrocollum itaquii differs from all other known sauropodomorphs based on a unique combination of characters such as those found on the skull, which include an antorbital fossa perforated by a promaxillary fenestra, and a medial margin of the supratemporal fossa with a simple smooth curve at the frontal/parietal suture. Classification Macrocollum, alongside Jaklapallisaurus and Unaysaurus, was found to belong to the clade Unaysauridae. Paleoecology Macrocollum lived between about 225.42 to 225 million years ago, in the Norian age of the late Triassic period. It was found in the south of Brazil, which at the time was connected to northwest Africa. At the time, most of the Earth's landmass was united into the supercontinent Pangaea, which was just starting to divide into Laurasia in the north, and Gondwana in the south. U-Pb (Uranium decay) dating found that the Caturrita Formation dates to around 225.42 million years ago, making it fewer than 10 million years younger than the Santa Maria and Ischigualasto Formations, from where the earliest dinosaurs are known. Studies The ilia of one of the paratypes of Macrocollum (CAPPA/UFSM 0001b) were used as a model in a study on the taphonomical effects of sedimentary compression on the iliac morphology of early sauropodomorphs.

Murphy, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), was a Supreme Court of the United States case of whether Congress disestablished the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation. After holding the case from the 2018 term, the case was decided on July 9, 2020, in a per curiam decision following McGirt v. Oklahoma that, for the purposes of the Major Crimes Act, the reservations were never disestablished and remain Native American country. In 1866, Congress established reservation boundaries for the Muscogee (Creek), Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole Nations. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation boundaries composes three million acres in Eastern Oklahoma, including most of the city of Tulsa. The boundaries for all five nations consist of over 19 million acres and nearly the entire eastern half of Oklahoma. In 1907, Congress admitted Oklahoma to the Union as the 46th state and federal territorial courts immediately transferred all non-federal cases involving Native Americans to state courts.Brief for Petitioner However, in the process, it has been found that Congress never officially disestablished the tribal reservations, a requirement for a tribal reservation to lose that status as demanded under Solem v. Bartlett (1984).. The situation arose following the appeal of a convicted murderer, Patrick Murphy, a member of the Muscogee-Creek tribe, with his crime taking place within the boundaries of Muscogee-Creek reservation as delimited by Congress in 1866. The appeal addressed whether the federal territorial courts had congressional authorization to make this transfer, as if the lands were still a tribal reservation, Murphy's crime would become subject to federal jurisdiction rather than Oklahoma. Although this case is specific to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the Court's decision is likely to also apply to reservations of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole Nations because all five tribes have similar histories within the state of Oklahoma. The case was first heard by the Supreme Court in its 2018‚Äì2019 term; Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself due to having participated as a federal appellate judge when the case was heard in lower courts, which created a potential deadlock between the remaining eight Justices. The Supreme Court announced at the end of the term that it would hold additional oral arguments during the 2019 term. It also heard a second case, McGirt v. Oklahoma, in May 2020 involving similar matters and which Justice Gorsuch had no prior conflict with.  Background  Boundaries of the Five Tribes in 1866 From the colonial and early federal period in the history of the United States the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Seminole Nations became known as the Five Civilized Tribes.Clinton, Fred S. Oklahoma Indian History, from The Tulsa World. The Indian School Journal, Volume 16, Number 4, 1915, page 175-187. These are the first five tribes that Anglo-European settlers generally considered to be \\"civilized\\". The \\"Five Tribes\\" once occupied much of the land in current day Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee. In the 1830s, Congress forcibly removed these tribes from their ancestral homelands to designated Indian Territory. The migration from these homelands to the designated territory is infamously known as the Trail of Tears. During the American Civil War, some of the tribes supported the Confederates. After the Union victory, the \\"Five Tribes\\" ceded all its territory in western Oklahoma. The Muscogee (Creek)'s present boundaries reflect two cessions. In 1856, the Muscogee (Creek) Nation \\"cede[d]\\" lands to the Seminoles.1856 Treaty arts. I, V. In 1866, Congress signed the Treaty with the Creek where the Muscogee (Creek) Nation \\"cede[d] ... to the United States\\" lands in return for $975,168.Treaty with the Muscogee (Creek), art. III, June 14, 1866, 14 Stat. 785. In the 1880s, the \\"Allotment Era\\" swept the Western United States. The Dawes Act of 1887 (also known as the General Allotment Act or the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887) authorized the President of the United States to survey Native American tribal land and divide it into allotments for individual Native Americans. Those who accepted allotments and lived separately from the tribe would be granted United States citizenship. The Curtis Act of 1898 amended the Dawes Act to extend its provisions to the Five Civilized Tribes; it required abolition of their governments, allotment of communal lands to people registered as tribal members, and sale of lands declared surplus, as well as dissolving tribal courts. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation reached a negotiated agreement with the federal government for the allotment of tribal lands, and Congress passed it into law in 1901. The original agreement specified that its terms would control over conflicting federal statutes and treaty provisions, but it in no way affected treaty provisions consistent with the agreement. The agreement's central purpose was to facilitate a transfer of title from the Muscogee (Creek) Nation generally to its members individually. It provided that \\"[a]ll lands belonging to the Creek tribe\\", except for town sites and lands reserved for public purposes, should be appraised and allotted \\"among the citizens of the tribe\\".Murphy, 866 F.3d at 1209. In 1906, Congress passed the Oklahoma Enabling Act, which empowered the people residing in Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory to elect delegates to a state constitutional convention and subsequently to be admitted to the union as a single union. The question before the Supreme Court is whether these laws and other similar federal statutes clearly disestablished the reservation of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. Statement of the case Patrick Murphy, a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, murdered George Jacobs near Henryetta, Oklahoma, on August 28, 1999. He confessed to the murder to Mr. Jacobs' former acquaintance, Ms. Patsy Jacobs, whom he was living with, and was arrested. An Oklahoma state court jury convicted Patrick Murphy of murder and imposed the death penalty in 2000. After his conviction, Murphy filed an application for post-conviction relief in an Oklahoma state court seeking to overturn his conviction by claiming the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute murders committed by Indians in Indian country; Henryetta lies within the former boundaries of the Moscogee reservation. The state district court concluded state jurisdiction was proper because the crime had occurred on state land. Murphy appealed to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals which also determined that the state had jurisdiction. Murphy then sought habeas relief in the Federal District Court of Eastern Oklahoma. The Federal District Court determined the Oklahoma state court decisions were not contrary to federal law and denied the habeas petition. Murphy then appealed to the Tenth Circuit, which reversed the decision of the District Court. The Tenth Circuit found no prior court had reviewed whether Congress disestablished the Muscogee reservation under the tests of Solem v. Bartlett (1984), a prior case that established that only Congress has the power to disestablish native reservations. On its own analysis of all laws passed by Congress related to the tribal reservation and Oklahoma's statehood, found no explicit statement of disestablishment. The Tenth Circuit also found that other acts of Congress around the time still treated the reservation as if it were Indian-owned land, contrary to the disestablishment intent if that had occurred. Thus, the Tenth Circuit ruled in favor of Murphy that he should have been prosecuted under federal jurisdiction. Supreme Court The state of Oklahoma petitioned for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States in February 2018, specifically asking the Supreme Court to rule on \\"whether the 1866 territorial boundaries of the Creek Nation within the former Indian Territory of eastern Oklahoma constitute an \\"Indian reservation\\" today under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß1151(a).17-1107\\".Question Presented Since Murphy had filed a federal habeas corpus petition in his challenge to the Tenth Circuit, the opposing party to his challenge was the \\"authorized person having custody of the prisoner\\", this being Interim Warden for the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, Mike Carpenter. Carpenter was represented by attorneys that also represent the interest of the state of Oklahoma. The Supreme Court granted the petition in October 2018, with affirmation that because Justice Neil Gorsuch had participated in the case while at the Tenth Circuit but before becoming a Supreme Court Justice, he would abstain from participating in the case at the Supreme Court level. =Argument for the petitioner= In addition to the state's statements, the federal government also filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Carpenter with the concern that if the Supreme Court affirmed the federal appellate court's decision, then \\"the federal government would have‚Äîand the State would lack‚Äîcriminal jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians in nearly all of eastern Oklahoma\\". Other amicus curiae briefs in support of Carpenter were filed by the International Municipal Lawyers Association, the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association, the Oklahoma Sheriffs' Association, the Environmental Federation of Oklahoma, and a consolidated brief on behalf of ten other state governments. Carpenter's attorneys argue that # Congress never established reservations for the Five Tribes. Although Congress established boundaries for the Five Tribes, these territorial boundaries do not meet the legal definition of a reservation. # Even if the boundaries meet the definition of a reservation, Congressional laws during the \\"Allotment Era\\" disestablished reservations. # Congress rescinded the Five Tribes' territorial sovereignty by stripping the Five Tribes of the most basic executive, legislative, and judicial functions to bestow those powers upon the new State. # Congress's transfer of jurisdiction over Indians to Oklahoma state courts is incompatible with the reservation status. =Argument for the respondent= Murphy is represented by his criminal defense attorneys. Amicus curiae briefs in support of Murphy were filed by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the Chickasaw Nation and Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma (joined by several former officials of the State of Oklahoma), the National Congress of American Indians, the Cherokee Nation (joined by historians and legal scholars), a group of former United States Attorneys, and the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. Murphy's attorneys argue that # Congress in 1866 established a reservation for the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. # The Supreme Court has clearly and resolutely affirmed that Solem v. Bartlett provides the ‚Äúwell settled‚Äù framework for assessing disestablishment. # The test provided in Solem to determine whether a reservation has been disestablished has not been met. # Although Congress established the Muscogee (Creek) Nation over 150 years ago, it is a well- established rule that courts will not repeal a statute unless Congress's intention is clear and manifest. =Proceedings= The original name of this case was Murphy v. Royal. Terry Royal, the Warden at Oklahoma State Penitentiary, accepted another job and resigned in good standing prior to briefings in the case. Before his resignation, Royal filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court on February 6, 2018. The Court granted the petition on May 21, 2018. On July 25, 2018, the case was renamed Carpenter v. Murphy to reflect the appointment of Mike Carpenter as Interim Warden of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. The case's first oral arguments were heard on November 27, 2018. Attorneys for Mike Carpenter, Oklahoma State Penitentiary Interim Warden, argued that Congress has clearly disestablished the Muscogee (Creek) Nation Reservation. Carpenter is backed by attorneys for the state of Oklahoma and the United States Solicitor General. Attorneys for Patrick Dwayne Murphy argued that there is no clear intention of Congress to disestablish the Muscogee (Creek) Nation Reservation. Murphy is backed by the National Congress of American Indians and other American Indian organizations. The Justices raised concerns about the practicality of deciding that much of Oklahoma would be classified as an Indian Reservation, which would potentially affect the livelihood of 1.8 million residents. With Tommy Sharp named as Interim Warden of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, the case was renamed Sharp v. Murphy in July 2019. Because of Gorsuch's recusal on the case, it is believed the remaining eight justices remained deadlocked on the case. In the 2019‚Äì20 term, the Supreme Court accepted the case of McGirt v. Oklahoma (Docket 18-9526) which deals with a similar matter of jurisdiction related to the former Indian reservations, but in which Gorsuch had no prior involvement, allowing all nine justices to hear the issue. =Decision= Sharp was decided per curiam on the basis of McGirt, with both decisions issued on July 9, 2020. From McGirt, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5‚Äì4 decision, with Gorsuch joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, that Congress had failed to disestablish the former reservation lands, and thus for purposes of the Major Crimes Act, those lands should be treated as \\"Indian country\\". The Sharp per curiam opinion upheld that decision, though Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. The per curiam decision affirmed the Tenth Circuit's decision, which overturned the state's conviction against Murphy and could potentially see him prosecuted anew in the federal courts. Impact The Supreme Court announced on the last day of the 2018 term, in June 2019, that it would re-order a new oral hearing session in its 2019 term, though as of March 2020, the case has yet to be scheduled for hearings. Analysts suggest that this means that without Gorsuch's participation, the Court is deadlocked on the issue. Should the Supreme Court uphold the Tenth Circuit's decision, that the crime occurred in Indian country under federal jurisdiction, the federal government will defer to the tribe on whether or not to impose the death sentence. Currently, the Muscogee (Creek) have not elected to apply the death penalty, so Murphy would likely receive a life sentence. Should the Court reverse the Tenth Circuit's decision, Murphy will be subject to the state of Oklahoma's decision, and his capital punishment sentence will stand. Similar logic would apply to about two thousand other Native Americans that are members of the Five Tribes, convicted of crimes committed within the reservation boundaries. Whether these convicts would see new trials is unclear, as in some cases, the convictions happened so long ago that it would be judicially improper to transfer the case from state to federal criminal courts. Similar effects could be had on the intersection of state, federal, and tribal laws affecting property rights. The ruling also opened the possibility for Native Americans to have more power in regulating the sale of alcohol and casino gambling.

He specialized in animal paintings (mostly horses) and genre scenes. Biography His father, Gunnar Wennerberg den √§ldre (1782-1860), was a rural dean in Lidk√∂ping. His brother was the poet and composer, Gunnar Wennerberg. He developed an early interest in music and painting, but eventually decided to focus on the latter. His first studies were with Uno Troili in Stockholm. In 1850, he continued his studies in Copenhagen. When his brother received a royal scholarship, he accompanied him to Germany on a study trip. Their first stop was Leipzig, where they attended concerts and visited museums. In D√ºsseldorf, he registered as a student at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, while his brother continued on to Italy. He was one of only two Swedish students at the academy; the other being Carl d'Unker. He stayed there for three years, during which time his primary instructors were Karl Ferdinand Sohn and Rudolf Wiegmann.Ruth Negendanck: Brynolf Wennerberg Maler * Zeichner * Gebrauchsgrafiker. Fischerhude 2012, , fr. s. 253 After his studies, he returned home and became involved in his father's church. He and some friends published an album called \\"Bilder ur Svenska Folklifvet\\" (Pictures from Swedish Folklife), which had some mild success. He was home for only short time when the money earned from painting portraits of a local nobleman and his family enabled him to make another trip overseas. In 1857, he went to Paris, rented a studio and took lessons from Thomas Couture. In 1860, he once again returned to Lidk√∂ping to marry Georgina Charlotta Schoug (1830-1870), the daughter of Johann Peter Schoug (1802-1890), a wealthy merchant from Germany. In 1870, Charlotta died of pneumonia. Two years later, he married her younger sister, Eugenia Louise (1845-1915).Biography from Vem √§r vem? @ Project Runeberg He built an estate near Lidk√∂ping, Krongodset Djurg√•rden, where he farmed and bred horses. It became an important meeting point for local artists, including Frederik Collett and Arvid Mauritz Lindstr√∂m. Emma Meissner, the soprano, and her brother, , the conductor, were also frequent guests. Between 1860 and 1890, he participated in several exhibitions at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts, but his works (mostly pictures of horses) received little serious attention. In 1889, a fire broke out at his estate and the main building was destroyed. Some paintings were rescued and sent to the local , but they made no attempt to rebuild and moved to G√∂teborg.

The locomotive of the freight train scraped the sides of several cars before causing severe damage to the fifth passenger coach. The impact tore open the side of the car, and boiler steam from the damaged freight engine, now on its side, shot into the coach. Many people were trapped in the coach and some were able to escape by breaking windows. Other passengers from rear cars also broke windows to vent the steam and free trapped passengers. This car sustained the most severe damage and accounted for most of the fatalities. All but one of the fatalities were caused by internal or external scalding by the boiler steam. Another 114 people were injured, with at least 56 requiring hospitalization. The freight train had ignored a stop signal and moved onto the passenger train's track. Rescue A deputy sheriff saw the crash from a nearby bridge and immediately radioed for medical services. Ambulances, doctors, and nurses from the nearby towns of Dansville and Hornell responded to the scene to treat the victims. The only hospital in Wayland was overwhelmed as it had only fifteen beds. Many wounded were taken to other towns by ambulance and private automobiles. Minor injuries were given first-aid treatment in clinics set up in a local American Legion building and Masonic Hall. A practice wartime blackout covering all of New York State except the New York City area was ignored during the rescue and was eventually cancelled by the US Army who also ordered civil defense personnel to help in the rescue. Army soldiers, most of whom were passengers, initially formed a police unit to keep the hundreds of spectators from interfering with rescue operations until sufficient police were available. Twenty-three New York State Troopers as well as deputies from the Steuben, Ontario and Livingston County Sheriff's Office responded. About 65 members of the Red Cross provided aid as well as local Boy Scouts. An emergency shipment of blood plasma was flown from Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester by the Civil Air Patrol to the Dansville Airport and landed with the aid of automobile headlights on the runway; additional blood was donated by people at the scene after an emergency blood service was set up. Aftermath The wreck damaged about of track. Six of the cars remained upright and were used to transport the passengers back eastward to Elmira for treatment of minor injuries and to spend the night. A DL&W; repair crew from Buffalo and another New York Central Railroad crew from Corning were dispatched to clear the wreck and reopen the main line to traffic. Train traffic was running on schedule on repaired track the next evening. The DL&W; sent a train from Hoboken, New Jersey, the next day with relatives of the victims to aid in identification of the dead, some of whom were scalded beyond recognition. Final identifications were not made for several days. Cause The cause of the accident was investigated by the railroad, the New York State Public Service Commission, and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The engineer of the freight train said he was not expecting the passenger train so soon as it had been reported to be behind schedule. The engineer of the passenger train, who had been regaining time and was only ten minutes behind at the time of the crash, said he saw the freight engine on the track ahead and applied the emergency brakes but could not stop in time. The train was traveling about (the track's speed limit) and had slowed to about at the time of the collision. Investigation confirmed that all signaling devices were operational and in the correct position. The location was not protected by a derail device, which \\"probably\\" would have prevented the accident according to a Public Service Commission investigator. Derail devices were usually used only when the siding was on a downgrade. The engineer of the freight train, 63-year-old Albert Driscoll, who had worked in that position for 37 years, testified the train was switching cars at the Gunlocke chair factory siding when he moved onto the main track after being signaled to do so by the brakeman. The brakeman said he assumed the train would stop before reaching the main line. There was other conflicting testimony over what signals were given, switch settings, the schedule of the passenger train, and whether the crew believed they could be on the main track for another ten minutes even though that was against formal rules. The ICC concluded the cause of the accident was a failure of the railroad to \\"adhere to and enforce operating rules which are essential to safety\\". Control was by timetable, train orders, and an automatic block and cab signal system. The freight train was required to be off the main line by 5:03 p.m., yet it moved back on the main line twenty minutes later when all signals allowed the passenger train to proceed. There was a long-standing practice to not strictly follow formal rules. The ICC report concluded with \\"Similar accidents may be expected to occur as long as operating officials fail to conform to the practices prescribed by their rules.\\" Other The spouse of one victim was awarded $23,000 in the settlement of a negligence claim against the railroad, while the surviving minor children of a couple were awarded $51,000. As a result of the accident, the Public Service Commission ordered the DL&W; to install derailing devices as an added safety measure on most sidings connecting to the main lines of the Scranton, Buffalo, Syracuse, and Utica divisions. At least one coach from the train has survived and was being repaired by the Midwest Railway Preservation Society in Cleveland, Ohio in 2013. In the media=Television= The passenger train car, known as the \\"Death Car\\" of the Lackawanna Limited wreck was featured as a haunted location on the paranormal TV series Most Terrifying Places which aired on the Travel Channel in 2019.

She was a Professor of Chemistry, Research Chair and head of the Wang Group at Queen's University, Canada, having joined the Department of Chemistry at Queen's University in 1996. Wang worked on the development of new Organometallic chemistry and luminescent materials chemistry. Her research interests also included the work on organic Photovoltaics and Nanoparticle, stimuli-responsive materials as well as OLEDs. Wang and her group developed a simple method of producing graphene-like lattice through light exposure, which may contribute to a huge field of future use. Wang held several patents related to the application of luminescent compounds and boron compounds. Wang co-authored over 285 publications. Wang was a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and a fellow of the Chemical Institute of Canada. In 2007, Wang received the Alcan Award for her extraordinary devotions to Organic chemistry. In 2015, she was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Wang was awarded a Killam Research Fellowship from Canada Council for the Arts. In 2019, Wang was nominated for and was recognized as a Distinguished Professor at Queen's University. The Distinguished Professor Program was created to celebrate some of the university's top internationally-recognized researchers.  Education and early life  Suning Wang was born on September 19, 1958. In 1982, she received her Bachelor Degree of Science in Chemistry at Jilin University in China. Later, she pursued a doctoral degree supervised by Richard Adams of Yale University in 1986, followed by Postdoctoral Fellow with John Fackler, Jr. of Texas A&M; University from 1986 to 1989.  Key Research Contributions = Photochromic and Photo-Responsive Materials = Wang led her group to discover new ways of photo- or thermal reactions by developing new ligand frameworks to create color-switching materials. For example, they found that a double mesitylene-elimination reaction with exciton-driven elimination known as EDE transforms some types of BN-heterocycles to BN- pyrenes, which can be used as emitters for EL devices. The phenomenon has the potential for new OLEDs or OFETs materials. Wang and her group focused on providing alternatives to polycyclic systems and their transformations with easily processable precursor species. In 2017, Wang published a simpler method to break the C-C bond in naphthalene and its derivatives to transform them into benzoborepin. This method of synthesis helps make new borepin systems applicable in the field of organic materials. = Luminescent and Charge- Transport Materials for OLEDs = Wang, together with her group, developed several luminescents and charge-transport materials with improved emission efficiencies, stability and color variety. In 2016, she found a binary composite with Eu(III) and Tb(III), which can be used as an efficient and bright source for white light.

The route number is a temporary designation placed along the route while it is upgraded to be converted to be a future alignment of SR 81\\\\. It connects the county seat of Henry County, McDonough, to the seat of Fayette County, Fayetteville via SR 54\\\\. It is known locally as Jonesboro Street in the city limits of McDonough, Jonesboro Road in Henry County, and McDonough Road in Clayton and Fayette counties. In honor of the late founder of Chick-fil-A, the majority of the route is signed as the S. Truett Cathy Highway. Route description The route's western terminus is a junction with SR 54 in Fayetteville. From here, McDonough‚ÄìFayetteville Road travels east as a two-lane road (one in each direction), crossing the Flint River into the southern part of Clayton County. The road takes a winding path through the area theorized to be the setting for the Tara plantation in the novel Gone with the Wind after crossing the river. It passes to the north of Lovejoy High School before coming to an intersection with US 19/US 41/SR 3 in Lovejoy. After crossing over the Norfolk Southern (formerly Macon and Western Railroad) track, the road continues northeast from an intersection with Hastings Bridge Road (formerly SR 3). The road enters Henry County, where it takes the name, Jonesboro Road. It passes south of Dutchtown High School, and then crosses over Walnut Creek. Now traveling east, the road crosses over Interstate 75 (I-75; exit 221) after expanding to a divided four-lane highway. Jonesboro Road has a direct connection to the interstate's South Metro Express Lanes. After the intersection that provides access to the express lanes, there are bike lanes travelling in along the sides of the highway. The route enters the city limits of McDonough, reducing back to a two-lane road without bike lanes just before an at-grade crossing with another Norfolk Southern track. From this crossing west to an intersection with McDonough Parkway, Jonesboro Road is dedicated as the SFC John Beale Hero's Highway. In the city limits, the route briefly takes the name Jonesboro Street. At the town square of the McDonough Historic District, Jonesboro Street comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 23/SR 20/SR 42/SR 81\\\\. =Bicycle route= State Bicycle Route 15 The section of McDonough Road from the route's western terminus to Hastings Bridge Road (Old SR 3) is part of State Bicycle Route 15, a bike route that travels from Acworth to the border with Florida north of the town, Jennings. This route is proposed to be included in U.S. Bicycle Route 15. History The highway existed as early as 1830 when white settlers began to occupy the area previously held by the Creek people after the Treaty of Indian Springs (1821), at the time it was known as the McDonough‚ÄìFayetteville Road. The road continued west to Carrollton and east to Monticello. During the mid-nineteenth century the road existed as a stagecoach road. During the American Civil War the road and its surroundings was the site of the Battle of Lovejoy's Station that took place on August 20, 1864. The length of the road from Lovejoy east to McDonough was used and entrenchment for Lieutenant General William J. Hardee and his reinforcements under Lieutenant General Alexander P. Stewart from September 1 to 18. A museum dedicated to battle existed just east of the border between Henry and Clayton counties along Jonesboro Road, but it was removed after controversy surrounding the museum's use of the Confederate flag. The land is now a county-owned park. The entire route was given a chipseal surface treatment by 1964, the exceptions to this was the section that was then-concurrent with SR 3, the section that crossed I-75, and the section east of the Norfolk and Southern track in McDonough; these were all paved with \\"high type pavement\\". By 1975, the entire route was \\"high type pavement\\". The temporary designation was planned for the route since at least 1964, where a GDOT map highlights the route with a temporary designation that will be removed when it is opened to \\"state route service.\\" The map details that when it enters service SR 81 will be moved to the road. A written note on the map says the SR 920 designation was added to the route on July 25, 1994. In 1999, the majority of the road was signed as the S. Truett Cathy Highway. During the first few years of the 2000s Henry County saw a rapid increase in its population growth and many widening projects occurred in the county along the route. This occurred in phases, first was from a then new shopping center west of the junction with I-75 to shortly to the east of that junction. Next widening took place from the east end of the first phase to the junction with the Norfolk and Southern track. On June 2, 2010 a mile long section of the road in McDonough was dedicated in honor of Sergeant John Beale, an Army National Guardsman that was killed in Afghanistan. On January 28, 2017, the I-75 South Metro Express Lanes were opened, giving Jonesboro Road direct access to the tolled lanes. Future , a mile of the route leading to the eastern terminus is in the process of being reconfigured. Currently the highway contracts from a four-lane divided highway to a two-lane street upon entering the city limits of McDonough. The reconfiguration will extend the divided highway all the way to its eastern terminus at the McDonough town square and improve intersections along the corridor. A major goal of the project is to improve the rail crossing for both pedestrian and vehicle traffic. The project is expected to be completed by 2020. Georgia DOT has long-range plans to widen the full length of the highway to four travel lanes. The first project, identifiable as Georgia DOT project ID 342970, plans to widen the roadway between Interstate 75 in Henry County and US 19/ US 41 in Clayton County. As of September 2019, construction is budgeted in fiscal year 2035. A second project, identifiable as Georgia DOT project ID 742870, would continue the four-lane highway between US 19/ US 41 in Clayton County and SR 54 in Fayette County. As of September 2019, construction is budgeted in fiscal year 2038.

Education and career  Born in Yarmouth, Novia Scotia, and raised in Maine, Flint was the son of William and Emeline (Vickery) Flint. He graduated salutorian from Bates College in 1871 and earned his master's degree from Bates in 1874. A lifelong secondary school teacher and administrator, Flint served as principal of Franceston Academy in New Hampshire (1871‚Äì1873), West Lebanon Academy in Maine (1873‚Äì1874), and Collinsville High School in Connecticut (1875‚Äì1898). He was a leading citizen in the Collinsville community, chairing the Ecclesiastical Society of the Collinsville Congregational Church, superintending Sunday school, and serving as president of the Collinsville Savings Society. Flint was also active in the Connecticut Association of Classical High School Teachers and spoke Latin, Greek, and Old English. He was a friend of William Edgar Simonds, a Collinsville-based lawyer and politician who chaired the Storrs Agricultural College's board of trustees and pushed for Flint's appointment as president in 1898. Following his departure from UConn, Flint became principal at Conant High School in East Jeffrey, New Hampshire (1903‚Äì1908). He spent two years in Pasadena, California (1911‚Äì1913) and worked twice at Choralcele Manufacturing Company in South Boston (1908‚Äì1911, 1913‚Äì1920).  Storrs Agricultural College  Flint became President of Storrs Agricultural College on July 1, 1898, following the ouster of the previous president, Benjamin F. Koons. Flint quickly clamped down on wasteful spending, upgraded the college's farming equipment, and built a new agricultural hall (the first brick building on campus). Flint's detractors among the faculty decried his management style as autocratic, though reportedly no one ever questioned his personal integrity. Flint's presidency was marked by controversy as he attempted to steer the college away from its agricultural roots toward a more comprehensive classical education. Tensions ran so high that the conflict was nicknamed the \\"War of the Rebellion.\\" Several faculty opposed to Flint resigned or were forced out. Debates raged in the op-ed sections of newspapers as far afield as Boston and New York. Connecticut newspapers staked out competing positions, with the Hartford Times and the Yale University-aligned New Haven Register arguing for and against Flint. In August 1901, the Connecticut State Grange, representing more than twelve thousand farmers, and the Connecticut Pomological Society called for Flint's resignation. Following heated debate, the college's board of trustees voted to fire Flint effective immediately on October 5, 1901. Trustees declined to grant him a professorship, as they had done with Koons, but voted to pay Flint his salary till the following July. Rufus W. Stimson succeeded Flint as president. Flint's ouster ended the influence of Simonds over the college. Flint's landmark achievement came on June 14, 1899, when the Connecticut General Assembly renamed the Storrs Agricultural College to the Connecticut Agricultural College. The rebranding underscored the college's statewide reach and status as a land-grant institution. In fall 1900, Flint hired his brother-in-law, Henry Ruthven Monteith (1848‚Äì1922), to teach English, history, civics, and political economy at the college. A long-time advisor to the Daily Campus student newspaper, Monteith became one of the college's most influential and popular faculty. The Monteith Building on UConn's Storrs campus was named in his honor.  Personal life  Flint married Elizabeth Monteith of McIndoe's Falls, Vermont, on January 30, 1873. The couple had one daughter (Georgiana, b. 1882) and two sons (William, b. 1875, and Harry, b. 1880), both of whom attended Yale University. George Flint died in Arlington, Massachusetts, on October 23, 1921. Elizabeth Flint died in Pasadena, California, on November 17, 1931.

Taking control of an anthropomorphic bug character wielding a gun, players would have needed to traverse through multiple levels while fighting against enemies and avoiding obstacles along the way. Deathwatch was demonstrated during the first Electronic Entertainment Expo held in 1995, featuring a visual style similar to that of Plok on the Super NES.

Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot from the E3 1995 beta build. Deathwatch is a side-scrolling run and gun platform game where players would have taken the role of an anthropomorphic bug character who wields a gun for defensive purposes and capable of making double jumps in order to traverse across various levels, each one featuring their own set of obstacles and thematic, while shooting at enemies to avoid taking damage and collecting items along the way. Players would have also need to collect power- ups in the level to change the character's in-game appearance.

It was listed for a December/Q4 1995 release in magazines, with internal documents from Atari Corp. also revealing that the game was internally known as The Bug. Though it was kept being advertised in catalogs and magazines for a late 1995 release, Atari halted its development before it was completed, with former DDI president and CEO Stewart Green stating in a 2003 forum post at AtariAge provided by community member panamajoe that the publisher's marketing department wanted to focus on 3D titles instead of 2D ones, in addition of stating that the source code of the game has become lost with time.

Biography =Education= Alexandre Lavalley finished his preparatory studies in Tours, entered the √âcole Polytechnique and left after studying military engineering in 1842. He resigned his commission and spent a few years in England, where he became a mechanic and acquired practical knowledge about machinery. =Engineering career= Photo of a dredge machine taken circa 1870 Upon returning to France, he joined Ernest Go√ºin & Cie, a company that built locomotives, where he was trusted to manage the locomotive plants. He also designed lighthouses on the Black Sea, created a tunnel boring machine in Lithuania, and created a machine to dredge ports in Russia. Paul Borel and Lavalley were hired as subcontractors by the Suez Canal Company to finish the excavation of the Suez Canal. They were responsible for the design, construction, and operation of the dredging machines that finished the excavation from 1864-1869 after the use of corvee labor was disallowed by the Ottoman administrator of Egypt, Ismail. In 1876, he obtained a concession to work on the port of Pointe des Galets in R√©union and to build a railroad linking the port to the interior of the island. In 1881, the British railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin and Lavalley were in the Anglo-French Submarine Railway Company that conducted exploratory work on both sides of the English Channel. On the English side a diameter Beaumont-English boring machine dug a pilot tunnel from Shakespeare Cliff. On the French side, a similar machine dug from Sangatte. The project was abandoned in May 1882, owing to British political and press campaigns asserting that a tunnel would compromise Britain's national defences.Wilson pp. 14‚Äì21 These early works were encountered more than a century later during the TML project. =Politician= Lavalley was elected on January 25, 1885 as a Senator representing Calvados. He sat in the left of the Senate, but voted with the majority for the new military law and for the colonial policies. He was absent during the vote for the breakup of the French Crown Jewels. Finally, Lavalley voted for the reestablishment of district elections (February 13, 1889), for a draft of the Lisbonne Law that would have restricted the freedom of the press, and against the procedure of the Senate against the general Georges Ernest Boulanger.

Dunlop led the council treaty settlement negotiations with Taranaki iwi and Nga Ruahine iwi. Significant Council properties were returned to iwi. One of the most important and historic properties, Te Ngutu O Te Manu, was returned to Nga Ruahine iwi. Te Ngutu O Te Manu was the home of Nga Ruahine chief Titokowaru. He successfully repelled two attacks by colonial forces on the village in 1868. Major Gustavus Von Tempsky was killed in the attack. A request by Iwi to fly the Tino Rangatiratanga flag in the council chamber was supported by Dunlop. A programme of cycleways and walkways is progressing with a pathway connecting Hawera to the coast at Waihi Beach completed. Dunlop is very interested in preserving local history, preserving heritage buildings and protecting and planting trees. In November 2018, Dunlop awarded a prize in the Hawera Christmas parade to the Hawera women's Lions Club float, with a black and white theme. Their blackened faces caused some community offence.

It was painted during the late Tang dynasty and the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, and is probably associated with the Zoroastrian cult of the Sogdian people. The historian , who is a member of the Academia Sinica of Taiwan, recognised this \\"paper image\\" as one of the \\"pieces of paper depicting Mazdean deities for the celebration\\". The drawing is preserved in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris.  Description  This sketch, painted on paper in black ink with light colouring, depicts two ladies sitting opposite each another, their heads being encircled by nimbi. Both are represented holding various attributes: the lady on the left, who sits on a rectangular throne supported by a row of lotus petals, holds a foliated cup and a tray with a dog seated on it. The one on the right is seated on a dog or wolf, and has four arms, the upper two supporting the sun and moon discs, the lower two arms holding a scorpion and a snake. They wear a characteristic hairstyle, surmounted by a water-drop-shaped or peach-shaped headdresses that are probably made of metal.  Analysis  Uyghur ladies have the same hairstyle. 10th-century fresco at the Mogao Caves. The drawing had been published in Jao Tsung-I's The Line Drawing of Dunhuang in 1978, but has only attracted the interest of researchers since it was displayed in the S√©rinde exhibition in 1995.

According to Jiang Boqin ()‚Äîa professor at Sun Yat-sen University‚Äîit is a piece of Zoroastrian art, and the four-armed deity is a Sogdian goddess worshipped in their Zoroastrian cult, whose name is , or Nanaia, the goddess originated from Mesopotamia. Frantz Grenet‚Äîa French specialist on Sogdiana and Zoroastrianism‚Äîand the historian Zhang Guangda argue that the lady on the left representing DaƒìnƒÅ, the good according to Zoroastrian vision; the other one represents Daƒìva, the bad.

Biography  John was born in Jurgon-les-Lacs in Brittany while his parents, Joan of Penthi√®vre and Charles of Blois,Hereford Brooke George, Genealogical Tables Illustrative of Modern History, (Oxford Clarendon Press, 1875), table XXVI ruled over the duchy of Brittany. Joan arranged to marry John to Margaret, daughter of Edward III of England, but Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, an ally of the Montforts, broke off the negotiations. Edward offered instead Philippa of Lancaster as a wife, but Joan declined. In 1356, John was given to the English as a hostage and he was held at Gloucester Castle under the care of Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland and Early of Oxford for nearly twenty-five years. On the death in 1380 of Charles V of France, who supported the Penthi√®vre claim against the Montforts, John and his mother negotiated the second treaty of Gu√©rande on 14 April 1381, in which he renounced his claim to the Duchy of Brittany in exchange for a substantial indemnity. John was released with financial assistance from Olivier de Clisson, who paid his 60,000 franc ransom and offered him his younger daughter, Marguerite, as a wife. On 6 January 1384, John transferred management of all of his lands in Brittany and Limoges to Clisson, who in turn transferred it to Jean Rolland in 1387. The French chronicler Jean Froissart recounts how, in 1391, John's cousin John IV, Duke of Brittany denounced the Penthi√®vre claim to the Breton throne, writing: In 1392, at a meeting at Tours, John renounced his family's right to carry the arms of Brittany. This was later confirmed at Guingamp on 25 October 1395. He inherited the lands of Avesnes, Landrecies, Nouvion-en-Thi√©rache, and some lands in Flanders on the death of his cousin, Guy II, Count of Blois, in 1397. Three years later, he inherited further property from his brother, Henry, who died in England. John died in 1404 at Lamballe in Brittany. His eldest son, Olivier, succeeded him. He shared with his three brothers the family inheritance: Olivier received Penthi√®vre, John the lands of Aigle in Normandy, Charles the lordship of Avaugour, and William the viscounty of Limoges.  Family  John married Margaret de Clisson, daughter of Olivier de Clisson, Constable of France, at Moncontour on 20 January 1387. They had: * Olivier, Count of Penthi√®vre and Seigneur of Avesnes (d. 1433 without legitimate posterity) * John, Lord of l'Aigle (d. 1454 without posterity) * Charles, Baron of Avaugour, through whose daughter, Nicole, the rulers of Penthi√®vre continued * William, Viscount of Limoges (d. 1455) * Joan, who married in 1458 John III de Harpedane, seigneur de Belleville and Montaigu as his second wife (his first wife was Margaret, natural daughter of Charles VI of France). * Marguerite de Ch√¢tillon, wife of Guillaume de Fayel.

It is a common damselfly, but usually under-recorded due to its similarity with other blue and black colored Pseudagrion species. Laidlaw described Pseudagrion bengalense as a new species, based on the comparison of his type in the Indian Museum with the mislabeled specimen of P. microcephalum as P. australasiae in British Museum.

Its thorax is azure blue with broad black dorsal and humeral stripes. Abdominal segments 1 and 2 are blue with black marks on the dorsum. A mark on segment 2 looks like a vase, broadly expanded at the middle. Segments 3 to 7 are black on the dorsum and blue on the sides. There are narrow blue apical annules on each segment. Segments 8 and 9 are blue with narrow black apical fringe. Segment 10 has an X-shaped, broad black mark on the dorsum and is blue on the sides. The superior anal appendages are black, diverging outward, and curving inward on the apices like hooks. They are bifid at apices and are half the length of segment 10. The inferiors are as long as the superiors. It can be distinguished from Pseudagrion microcephalum, Pseudagrion spencei and Pseudagrion malabaricum by its short anal appendages. It can be further distinguished from Pseudagrion malabaricum by its superior anal appendages being bifid at the apices. The eyes and thorax of the female are bluish green, marked as in the male.

Its primary developer Kent Overstreet first announced it in 2015, and efforts are ongoing to have it included in the mainline Linux kernel. It is intended to compete with the modern features of ZFS or btrfs, and the speed and performance of ext4 or XFS. Features bcachefs is a copy-on-write (COW) file system for Linux-based operating systems. Planned or existing features for bcachefs include caching, full file-system encryption using the ChaCha20 and Poly1305 algorithms, native compression via zlib, LZ4, and Zstandard, snapshots, CRC-32C and 64-bit checksumming. It can use multiple block devices, including in RAID configurations. bcachefs provides all the functionality of bcache, a block-layer cache system for Linux, with which bcachefs shares about 80% of its code. History Primary development has been by Kent Overstreet, the developer of bcache, which he describes as a \\"prototype\\" for the ideas that became bcachefs. Overstreet intends bcachefs to replace bcache. Overstreet has stated that development of bcachefs began as bcache's developers realized that its codebase had \\"been evolving ... into a full blown, general-purpose POSIX filesystem\\", and that \\"there was a really clean and elegant design\\" within it if they took it in that direction. Some time after bcache was merged in 2013 into the mainline Linux kernel, Overstreet left his job at Google to work full-time on bcachefs. After a few years' unfunded development, Overstreet announced bcachefs in 2015, at which point he called the code \\"more or less feature complete\\", and called for testers and contributors. He intended it to be an advanced file system with modern features like those of ZFS or btrfs, with the speed and performance of file systems such as ext4 and XFS. As of 2017 Overstreet was receiving financial support for the development of bcachefs via Patreon. As of mid-2018, the on- disk format had settled. Patches had been submitted for review to have bcachefs included in the mainline Linux kernel, but had not yet been accepted. By mid-2019 the desired features of bcachefs had reached and associated patches to LKML was submitted for peer review.

It is one of 29 species of madtom. Description The Ozark madtom has a stout body and small head. A dark bar can be found at the base of the caudal fin, and the caudal fin is usually straight or slightly rounded. The pectoral fin has 9 rays, and the anal fin has 13 to 16 rays. The fish has a total length of 120 mm (4 in). Distribution and habitat The Ozark madtom are found around the upper White River and the Little Red River in the Ozark Uplands in Arkansas and Missouri, United States. The Ozark madtom can by found in riffles and rocky pools, as well as cool, clear, high-gradient creeks and small to medium-sized rivers. They are found in shallow depths (usually of less than half a meter deep) and high velocity currents. During the day, they use the rocky bed bottom as cover. Diet Most of the Ozark madtom's diet consists of aquatic insects, with Diptera (flies) making up a majority. Ephemeroptera (mayflies) make up most of the remainder of the diet. Behavior It is presumed that Ozark madtom are nocturnal. Nests are found under small flat rocks in pools that are about one-third to two-thirds of a meter deep. In the moments before spawning, males have enlarged head muscles and swollen lips, similar to other madtoms. It is presumed that these enlarged heads are associated with nest construction, helping with the clearing and burrowing by males under rocks. Life history Ozark madtoms have yellow spherical eggs. Their eggs adhere to each other but to no other surfaces. After about 4 days after spawning, the embryos obviously show blood, myomeres are well developed, the tail is free from the yolk sac, pigment is well developed in the eye, and a couple sets of barbels are beginning to form. At hatching, the larvae are 8 mm (0.3 in) long and mostly translucent. They gain melanophores on their head. Caudal and anal fins begin to develop and another pair of barbels appears near the nostrils. About 7 days after hatching, the larvae are 12 mm (0.5 in) long. All fins are nearly adult-like. The barred pattern found in adults does not form until later. After 9 months, the fish are about 53 mm (2 in) long. Predators Luxilus zonatus (bleeding shiners) are known to prey upon the Ozark madtom's eggs, while Etheostoma caeruleum (rainbow darters) and Percina evides (gilt darters) are known to prey upon the Ozark madtom's larvae.

He is noted for his illustrations of \\"macho-type\\" men, often with yakuza-inspired irezumi tattoos. Mishima, along with Tatsuji Okawa, Sanshi Funayama, and Go Hirano, is regarded by artist and historian Gengoroh Tagame as a central figure in the first wave of contemporary gay artists in Japan. Biography Mishima was born in 1924 in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture. At 18, he was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army, where he had his first homosexual experience with his commanding officer. Upon the end of the Second World War in 1945, Mishima relocated to Tokyo, where he immersed himself in the nascent gay nightlife of the city. Many bars and nightclubs during this era were operated by the yakuza; Mishima's fascination with their crew cut hairstyles and irezumi tattoos would figure heavily into his art. During the late 1950s, Mishima discovered the art of Tom of Finland, who came to influence his own work. In 1955, Mishima met the writer Yukio Mishima at a gym, and formed a friendship on their shared interest in athletics, bodybuilding, and hypermasculine sexuality. The two men drew artistic nudes together as a pastime; Go Mishima began to pursue a career in homoerotic art in earnest with Yukio Mishima's encouragement, and adopted Mishima's last name to use as his pen name in tribute. After Yukio Mishima's death by ritual suicide, Go Mishima began to depict more violent material and themes in his art, including bondage, masochism, and torture. In 1964, Mishima was published in and Bara, two of the first magazines in Japan to publish gay and gay pornographic content. He was an early contributor to Barazoku, which in 1971 became the first commercially circulated gay magazine in Japan. Dissatisfied with the bish≈çnen art style of Barazoku, Mishima founded in 1974, which focused on images of masculine men, and was more explicitly pornographic. On January 5, 1988, Mishima died of complications from cirrhosis. A commemorative issue of Barazoku was published in tribute to Mishima in 1989, in which Sadao Hasegawa referred to him as \\"a master illustrator of the male physique.\\" The first solo exhibition of Mishima's art was held in 1999, at Gallery Naruyama in Tokyo.

Laurentius Nicolai Blackstadius var f√∂dd 23 augusti 1590 i Kumla, d√∂d 19 maj 1640 i Falun. from Blacksta Parish in S√∂dermanland. His father, Adolf, was a sea captain. When he was eight, he accompanied his father on a voyage that would last for six years. He received his education from local, private schools while the ship was in port. Upon their return to Sweden, he was apprenticed to the lithographer, Karl Fredrik Natanael Schult√©n (1797-1868), who was his mother's half-brother. At the same time, he took classes at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. In 1844, after travelling around Sweden, he went to Finland where he stayed for five years; making his living by painting portraits. By 1850, he had earned enough money to travel throughout Europe; a study trip that included a stay at the studios of Thomas Couture in Paris. When he returned to Sweden, in 1854, he painted altarpieces and restored frescoes in several major churches. In 1858, he returned to the Royal Academy as an \\"agr√©\\" (a type of member candidate). From 1860, he taught figure drawing and painting at the Sl√∂jdf√∂reningens skola (Craft Association School), which is now called the Konstfack. He retired, with a pension, in 1881.

Phineaus Pratt or Phinehas Pratt), a joiner from London, was one of the first English settlers in New England and enrolled among the \\"First Comers\\" of Plymouth Colony. Pratt arrived as part of the company of Thomas Weston on the 1622 voyage of the ship Sparrow and was among the founders of the Wessagusset (Weymouth) settlement which failed in March 1623. In 1623, when it still numbered about 32 dwellings, Pratt joined the Plymouth Colony and later married Mary Priest, the daughter of Mayflower passenger Degory Priest. In 1662, he wrote an account of the early days of the Wessagusett colony as part of a petition to the General Court of Massachusetts for \\"First Comer\\" status, which he was granted.  English origins  Phineas Pratt was born in London, Middlesex, England around 1593. He was the son of the Reverend Henry Pratt and his wife Mary. Henry Pratt was a Puritan Nonconformist minister who was imprisoned in England for preaching the gospel contrary to the rule of the Church of England. Family legend has it that Henry communicated with his family by writing letters penned in his own blood. According to the book Phinehas Pratt and Some of His Descendants, written by Eleazer Franklin Pratt and published posthumously in 1897: \\"Tradition relates that the father of Henry was John, and that either John or the father of John, was a Frenchman who bore the surname of Plat or Platt; having fled from France during some political excitement in that country, he became and \\"Armor-bearer\\" to the Monarch of England, and his name was subsequently changed to Pratt.\\" However, according to more recent genealogists, his grandfather‚ÄîJohn Henry Pratt‚Äîmay have in fact been from Bishopworth, Somerset, England.  Career  Phineas Pratt was by profession a joiner, or carpenter. = The ill-fated Wessagusset settlement = Some time prior to 1622, at around the age of 29, Phineas Pratt and his brother Joshua Pratt joined the company of Thomas Weston, a London Merchant involved with the Leiden Separatists and Pilgrims who settled Plymouth Colony in 1620. Known to the Pilgrims as the \\"Strangers\\", this group of adventurers arrived in New England in 1622 on three ships: the Sparrow, Charity and Swan. Phineas Pratt was a passenger on the Sparrow, which was the first ship of the three to arrive. Poorly supplied, with inferior provisions and with many ill, Weston's total company comprised approximately 67 men, about ten of whom sailed on the Sparrow and (through some mis- navigation) put ashore in Damarill's Cove (Damariscove Islands), off the now State of Maine, to find a site for another plantation. Encountering some Native Americans, Weston's men thought it best to settle closer to the Plimoth plantation. Weston sent Pratt with a group of about seven men to scout out the area around Plymouth. Encountering the settlers there, who were in need of provisions, they brought some back to the Maine encampment to give them some supplies. Eventually, the group sailed to Plymouth to await the arrival of the Charity and Swan, and the Pilgrims supported them throughout the summer of 1622. In August, after the arrival of the Swan, the merchant's company built a trading post stockade in the abandoned native settlement of Wessaguscus, now Weymouth, Massachusetts, under the leadership of Weston's brother-in-law: Richard Greene. = Pratt's journey through the snow = According to the Pilgrim Hall Museum, the settlement at Wessagusset was problematic from the start. Greene soon died during a visit to Plymouth and was replaced by John Sanders. \\"They soon fell into difficulties through behaving, generally, in a very foolish and improvident fashion. They also severely angered the local Native Americans by stealing their corn.\\" In his memoir of travels to the colony, Christopher Levett complains of company members, \\"They neither applied themselves to planting of corn, nor taking of fish, more than their present use, but went about to build castles in the aire, and making of forts, neglecting the plentiful time of fishing; when winter came, their forts would not keep out hunger, and they having no provision beforehand, and wanting both powder and shot to kill deer and fowl, many starved to death and the rest hardly escaped.\\" (In their defense, Eleazer Pratt mentions that the company had settled their colony too late to plant food for the winter.) Members of the company stole both from the natives led by Pecksuot and from their own countrymen in Plimoth. According to Eleazer Pratt's narrative, \\"The half- starved company of Weston had some among their number who could not resist the temptation of stealing and eating the inviting grain. The Plymouth people detected some of them trespassing thus, and had them severely whipped, for what an old chronicler termed 'a few caps of corn'.\\" According to Pratt's own narrative: > \\"Some time after this their Sachem came suddenly upon us with a great number > of armed men; but their spies seeing us in readiness, he & some of his chief > men turned into one of their houses a quarter of an hour. Then we met them > outside the pale of our plantation & brought them it. Then said I to a young > man that could best speak their language, \\"Ask Pecksuot why they come thus > armed.‚Äü He answered, \\"Our Sachem is angry with you.‚Äü I said, \\"Tell him if he > be angry with us, we be angry with him.‚Äü Then said their Sachem, \\"English > men, when you came into the country, we gave you gifts and you gave us > gifts; we bought and sold with you and we were friends; and now tell me if I > or any of my men have done you wrong.‚Äü We answered, \\"First tell us if we > have done you any wrong.‚Äü He answered, \\"Some of you steal our corn & I have > sent you word times without number & yet our corn is stolen. I come to see > what you will do.‚Äü We answered, \\"It is one man which has done it. Your men > have seen us whip him divers time, besides other manner of punishments, & > now hear he is, bound. We give him unto you to do with him what you please.‚Äü > He answered, \\"That is not just dealing. If my men wrong my neighbor Sachem > or his men, he sends me word & I beat or kill my men, according to the > offense. If his men wrong me or my men, I send him word & he beats or kills > his men according to the offense. All Sachems do justice by their own men. > If not, we say they are all agreed & then we fight, & now I say you all > steal my corn.\\" The company did not turn over the man. Shortly thereafter, in March 1623, Massasoit, who was then sachem of the Wampanoags, informed the Plymouth colonists that there was a conspiracy among the natives of the Wessagusset area to massacre the Weston men. Just as Myles Standish was about to set out to rescue Weston's men on March 24, Phineas Pratt arrived in Plymouth \\"from the Massachusetts with a small pack at his back.\\" According to Pratt's own narrative, he had become uneasy and told his company that someone needed to warn the Plimoth settlement, lest they all be slain. No one else was willing to accompany him. Believing the natives were simply waiting for the snow to melt, Pratt pretended to go out gathering nuts and instead set out walking 25 miles in the snow, journeying for several days without food. Pratt famously walked backward through the snow on part of this journey, hoping to deceive anyone following him into thinking he journeyed in the opposite direction. Standish and his men journeyed to Wessagusett to protect the company there, killing several of the chiefs (Pecksuoth and another sachem called Wittawaumet) in the process of the journey. Pratt did not accompany them, as he was \\"faint\\". Instead he \\"asked that hee might there remaine until things were settled at the other plantation.\\" When he was able, Pratt rejoined his company at Piscataqua, but soon thereafter Weston's group abandoned the stockade at Wessagusset. Pratt was involved in recorded conflicts with natives of Massachusetts in Wessgusett, Agawam (Ipswich) and Dorchester. According to Pratt, nine of the Wessagusett company died of famine, two were slain by natives of the area, and one died on his way to the fishing ships after the colony abandoned the town. = Settlement in Plymouth = Sometime in late 1623, Weston ended his venture. Most of the remaining company returned home. Phineas Pratt and others joined the Plymouth settlement, where they were received with mixed feelings, and later listed as if they were passengers of the Anne. According to John Winslow, \\"I would not be understood to think there were no well-deserving persons among them\\". Pratt was included in a division of land in Plymouth in 1623, where he and Joshua Pratt were assigned, jointly, two acres of land. In 1624 when Plymouth was divided into twelve companies, Phineas and Joshua were assigned to Francis Cooke. At this time Plymouth comprised about 32 dwellings and was one half mile large.  Marriage and later life  In 1630, Phineas Pratt married Mary Priest, daughter of Degory Priest and his wife Sarah (Allerton) Vincent. Mary was born in England around 1612. Degory Priest had left his wife and daughters Mary and Sarah behind in Leiden, intending to return for them, but died during the difficult first winter of the settlement. His widow married again in Holland (her third marriage) to Cuthbert Cuthbertson (aka Godbert Godbertson), and arrived with her daughters and baby son on the ship Anne, in 1623. Upon marrying Mary Priest (aka Marah Godbertson), Phineas became possessed of thirty acres of land on the high cliff, and they purchased thirty more at Winslow Stand near Phineas' land. On August 6, 1646, Phineas sold his estate in Plymouth to John Cooke and around May 20, 1648, Pratt purchased a house and garden in Charlestown, Massachusetts, purchased from George Bunker, somewhere between the \\"windmill hill and that way which goes into Elbow Lane.\\" = 1662 and 1668 petitions to the General Court = In 1662, at the age of about 69, Pratt presented to the General Court of Massachusetts a request for financial assistance and to establish his status as a \\"First Comer\\" entitled to the benefits the earliest settlers of Massachusetts were afforded by law. To support this claim, Pratt submitted an extraordinary narrative of his early days in the settlement titled A declaration of the affaires of the Einglish People, that first inhabited New Eingland. In response, the court granted him three hundred acres of land \\"laid out in the wilderness on the east of the Merrimack River, near the upper end of the 'Nacoke Brooke'.\\" (This was in Dunstable, near present-day Litchfield, New Hampshire, though the value would not be able to be realized on this wild land for decades to come.) In October 1668, at age around 75, Pratt again petitioned the Court: > \\"To the Honoured the Generall Court, holden at Boston this‚Äî October 1668 I > acknowledg myself truly thankfull unto the Honoured Court for that they gave > me at the time I presented an History called, A declaration of the affaires > of the Einglish People, that first inhabited New Eingland.

I am one of that litle > number, ten men that arrived in the Massachusetts Bay for the setling of a > Plantation, & am the remainder of the forlorn hope sixty men. We bought the > south part of the Bay of Aberdecest their Sachem. Ten of our company died by > famine. Then said ye Natives of the Countrey, \\"Let us kill them whist they > are weak, or they will possesse our Countrey & drive us away.\\" Three times > we fought with them, thirty miles I was pursued for my life, in times of > frost, wnd snow, as a deer chased with wolves. Two of our men were kill'd in > warr, one shot in the shoulder. It was not by the wit of man nor by ye > strength of the arme of flesh, that we prevailed against them. But God, that > overrules all power, put fear in their hearts. And now, seeing God hath > added a New England to Old Engl. and given both to our dread Soverig Lord > King Charles the second, many thousand People enjoy the peace thereof; Now > in times of prosperity, I beseech you consider the day of small things ; for > I was almost frozen in time of our weak beginnings, and now I am lame. My > humble request is for that may be for my subsistaunce, the remaining time of > my life.\\" Pratt's 1668 request was not granted.  Death and burial  On April 19, 1680, Phineas Pratt died in Charlestown, Massachusetts. According to his gravestone, he was \\"about 90 years\\". The will of Phineas Pratt dates January 8, 1677. According to the records of the Pilgrim Hall Museum, the text is as follows: > I, Phinias Pratt of Charlstown in the Countie of Midellsex Joyner being very > aged and Crazye of body yett in my pfect memory and understanding doe make > This my last will and Teastamoen.

History The society's first meeting was held on February 26, 1899; in the following year its first national congress was held on March 27, 1900, and the national organization was officially incorporated on May 7, 1900 in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. While L'Union was primarily formed for the purpose of creating sick, disability, and death funds for American French-speaking Catholics, the organization would also provide scholarships, civic education, and held cultural events including celebrations on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, parades, culinary and musical events, including French opera performances. The USJB also maintained a large collection of Franco-Americana that it purchased from the estate of American Civil War Major Edmond Mallet in 1908. Conducting the entirety of its business in French for most of its existence, in 1966 the organization became officially bilingual, adding English content to its bimonthly newsletter in 1972. After 1982, non-Catholics were granted membership, and from 1977 until its merger 1991, the Society held the Franco- American Interest in the Handicapped, known as Project FAITH, an annual seminar discussing advancements in the providing of care for the mentally and physically disabled. Other services included distribution of grants to French language programs at several colleges, guaranteed student loans, charter trips, and an annual pilgrimage language development program. Following a period of decline, the organization's mutual functions were merged with Catholic Financial Life in 1991. =Today= Although the mutual functions of the organization were folded into Catholic Family Life, a handful of chapters remained active in some form as recently as 2019.

Prior to his assumption of the emirate in Aleppo, he had been the Mirdasid emir of al-Rahba from 1060. He continued as the emir of al-Rahba and the eastern portion of the Mirdasid realm after losing Aleppo to his nephew Mahmud ibn Nasr. He lost al-Rahba in 1070. He entered Byzantine protection afterward and launched a failed assault against Mahmud‚Äôs territories before his death in Constantinople. Family Atiyya was the son of Salih ibn Mirdas, who established Mirdasid rule in Aleppo in 1024, and his wife Tarud.Bianquis 1993, p. 119.Zakkar 1971, p. 51. The latter was noted in contemporary sources for her beauty. Both Salih and Tarud belonged to the Banu Kilab, a large Arab tribe that dominated northern Syria and the western Jazira in the 11th century. In 1014, Salih had been forced to divorce Tarud during his incarceration by the emir of Aleppo, Mansur ibn Lu'lu' so that the latter could wed her. Salih later defeated Mansur and remarried Tarud. It is not known if Atiyya was born before or after these events.Zakkar 1971, p. 166. However, his name  øA·π≠iyya (\\"the Gift\\"), suggests he was born after Salih and Tarud remarried, according to historian Suhayl Zakkar. Atiyya‚Äôs older brothers Nasr and Thimal were born to a different mother. Emir of al-Rahba Nasr and Thimal jointly succeeded Salih as emir of Aleppo after Salih‚Äôs death in 1029, but Nasr ultimately took sole control of the city in 1030, while Thimal was relegated to the fortress of al-Rahba on the Euphrates River in the western Jazira. After Nasr‚Äôs death in 1038, the Fatimid Caliphate's governor in Syria, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, conquered Aleppo and proceeded to take over the entire Mirdasid emirate, seizing Balis and Manbij but failing to capture al-Rahba. Al-Dizbari died in Aleppo in 1042, after which Thimal retook Aleppo. He allied with the Fatimids and handed over control of al-Rahba to the pro-Fatimid general Arslan al-Basasiri so that the latter could use it as a launching point to invade Abbasid Iraq. When al- Basasiri was defeated and killed in 1060, Fatimid influence in the western Jazira took a blow and Atiyya was able to seize al-Rahba, where he found the treasures and arsenal stored by al-Basasiri in preparation of the war on the Abbasids. At some point prior to his conquest of al-Rahba, Atiyya had taken control of Balis.Amabe 2016, p. 68. At the time of Atiyya‚Äôs capture of al- Rahba, Thimal had given up control of Aleppo to the Fatimids in exchange for the governorship of the coastal districts of Acre, Beirut and Jubayl. The Banu Kilab insisted on the Mirdasids‚Äô return to Aleppo and entrusted Atiyya‚Äôs nephew Mahmud ibn Nasr with taking back the city. The ahdath (urban militia) of Aleppo allowed the Banu Kilab to enter the city in July 1060, but the Fatimid army held onto the citadel and Fatimid troops were sent to evict the Banu Kilab.Bianquis 1993, pp. 119‚Äì120. The troops were defeated in August 1060 and Atiyya took control of the citadel.Bianquis 1993, p. 120. Two days later control passed to Mahmud. As a consequence of the Fatimids‚Äô loss of Aleppo, Thimal was stripped of his coastal districts and sought to take over Aleppo from his nephew Mahmud. Thimal reached an agreement with Mahmud brokered by the latter‚Äôs mother al-Sayyid al-Alawiyya and the sheikhs (chieftains) of the Banu Kilab that restored Thimal‚Äôs rule in 1061. Atiyya, meanwhile, became independent in his emirate of al-Rahba. Emir of Aleppo In a surprise move, Thimal chose Atiyya as his successor rather than Mahmud, who had the backing of the sheikhs of Banu Kilab and his maternal kinsmen, the Banu Numayr. Mahmud contested Atiyya‚Äôs succession after Thimal‚Äôs death in late 1062. The two sides fought each other in July 1063 but neither gained the decisive edge. Instead, a truce was arbitrated giving Atiyya control of Aleppo and the eastern half of the emirate stretching from al-Rahba in the southeast to Qinnasrin in the northwest and northward to Azaz. Mahmud was given the western portion of the emirate. Atiyya rejected the division of the Mirdasid emirate and brought in 1,000 Turkmen archers led by their prince, Ibn Khan, to assist him against Mahmud and his supporters and extract more concessions from them. This marked the first recorded entry of free Turkmen troops into northern Syria, as opposed to Turkish slave-soldiers. The Turkmens proved unruly and Atiyya subsequently had the ahdath of Aleppo pillage Ibn Khan‚Äôs camp in al- Hadir.Amabe 2016, p. 69. Many of the Turkmens were killed and Ibn Khan defected to Mahmud. Together they defeated Atiyya at Marj Dabiq in 1065. They proceeded to besiege Atiyya in Aleppo for three months before Atiyya surrendered in August. Mahmud entered Aleppo and a new arrangement was reached that gave Atiyya control of the eastern emirate, i.e. the western Jazira including al-Rahba, while Mahmud controlled the western emirate including Aleppo, Jund Qinnasrin (Chalcis District) and a significant portion of Jund Hims (Homs District). Later campaigns and death The Fatimids apparently encouraged Atiyya to assault Mahmud, prompting the latter and Ibn Khan to attack Homs and Hama in 1067 in preparation for an assault on al-Rahba. Direct hostilities were avoided after the qadi (chief Islamic judge) of Tripoli, Ibn Ammar, mediated between Atiyya and Mahmud. The Fatimids formally recognized the division of the Mirdasid emirate reached in 1065. However, Atiyya still laid claim on Homs, a town held by Mahmud. During his attempt to capture the city, in 1068, his al-Rahba headquarters was seized by the Uqaylid emir Muslim ibn Quraysh. Atiyya took up residence in Fatimid-controlled Damascus and lost his last possession, al-Raqqa, to Ibn Quraysh in 1070/71.Zakkar 1971, p. 180. After Atiyya‚Äôs requests for military assistance from the Fatimids to restore his emirate were rebuffed, he sought the aid of the Byzantines.Bianquis 1993, p. 121. With support of their troops in Antioch, he launched a raid on Ma'arrat Misrin in Mahmud‚Äôs emirate in 1071. The raid was apparently of little consequence. The Byzantines supported Atiyya‚Äôs activities in the aftermath of their defeat at the Battle of Manzikert and their aim was to weaken or expel the Turkmen troops of the emirate. Afterward, he took refuge in the Byzantine capital at Constantinople where he died in July 1073.

It features Hercules and other pagan deities framed by columned registers of classic spiral-fluted Doric and Ionic columnar styles, creating a theatrical border around the figures. It was created shortly after the Roman conversion to burial practice when Romans went from using cremation to burying their dead, due to new ideas of an afterlife.Tuck, Steven L.. A History of Roman Art, John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated, 2014. ProQuest Ebook Central, http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1887116.  Form  The Velletri Sarcophagus was made from marble (even though the marble sarcophagi would not become popular until the 3rd century) and decorated in a high relief. It is long, high, and wide. Most of the sarcophagus has kept its fine detail, however there has been some erosion in figures, leaving them to be more mysterious, and the right side panel of the roof is gone.  Content  At first glance the sarcophagus is filled with characterless, vaguely faced figures dancing and acting a narrative amongst the theatrical setting. However, these figures each have a name, a story, and a meaning. There are a total of 86 human and divine figures (including Caryatids and Telamons), 43 mythical creatures, and 40 animals. All deities or heroes represent life after death, indicating the object's purpose. Those that appear include the gods of Olympus, Pluto, Persephone, Cerberus, Hades, Neptune, Jupiter, Mercury, Admetus, Protesilaos, Alcestis, and, most importantly, Hercules.Lawrence, Marion. ‚ÄúThe Velletri Sarcophagus.‚Äù American Journal of Archaeology, vol. 69, no. 3, 1965, pp. 207‚Äì222. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/502285. The elaborate decoration of the pediments and columns adds to the stage-like setting. Front, left side view of sarcophagus. Though the photograph is poor, the side is recognizable by the lower register's chaos. The Front Long View displays more action and movement. The addition of chariots adds to this effect. Strong, atlas-like Telamon figures are found on all sides of the bottom register, wrapped around the sarcophagus (minus the corners, where there are bull heads), supporting the rest of the structure. In the center of the main register sits Pluto, or Hades, enthroned next to Persephone. The creature Cerberus sits to the right of the two, identifying Pluto. Adjacent to the enthroned are a nude Neptune carrying a dolphin and Jupiter with his lightning bolt standing with their back to doors from which the face of Medusa protrudes. Other happenings on that register include deliverance from Pluto. On the left a covered woman figure emerges from behind a door, being led by Mercury. This scene looks similar to the story of Protesilaos' visit to hell out of her grief for Laodamia. The right shows the deliverance of Alcestis by Hercules, similarly emerging from a door. This story is common in sarcophagi, particularly when a wife had died before her husband. The lower register displays the Rape of Persephone. The scene is flooded with chariots, and on the left end is a small group of maidens caught in the middle of the action. They are known as the group of Minerva. To the right of the central rape is the mouth of a cave, opened and swallowing an unidentified woman. The Back Long View features a frieze in the main register of the 'Labours of Hercules'. The left end presents Hercules (separated by a column) and the Erymanthian Boar with Eurystheus and his pot. Next, Hercules is found in combat with the Cyreneian Stag; the form they are presented in is reminiscent of depictions of Mithras slaying the bull Tauroctony. This face is highly eroded, but it is presumed that Hercules is seen walking away from the viewer while holding a (better preserved) lion's skin. The next scene shows the Amazonian queen Hippolyta being dragged across the floor by Hercules to obtain her golden girdle.Van de Velde, Carl. ‚ÄúThe Labours of Hercules, a Lost Series of Paintings by Frans Floris.‚Äù The Burlington Magazine, vol. 107, no. 744, 1965, pp. 114‚Äì123. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/874556. The next scene is thought to be of Hercules cleaning the Augean Stables. Another eroded scene displays Hercules taking the Cretan Bull by the horns. Finally the register's narratives end with the hero with the horses of Diomedes. Hercules stands faceless (because of erosion) in front of two jumping horses, trying to control them. The lower register is relaxed, as two women pick fruit from a tree to the left. To the right of them kneels Sisyphus as if he is a Telamon himself. In the center rows Charon's boat, taking the deceased to his new life in the underworld. On the far end stands three Danaides, daughters of Danaus, holding pitchers and standing around a cauldron, as they are commonly depicted. Their significance is not known. The Right Side View with broken roof exhibits the same relief as expected. At the left in the main register are Hercules and the lion, where his arm seems to thrust into the lions mouth. In the center are two unknown men, one older and one younger, in his prime. According to the scholars Lawrence and Baroccinni, who closely studied the sarcophagus, they may be the Deceased and the Ancestor. The right end shows Hercules and the (Medusa-esque) Hydra, where the hero has grabbed the creature and is about to take it out as he swings his club over his head. On the bottom kneels the Telamon figures with a procession of sacrifice, where two bulls are led and men wear traditional clothing, one with an ax. The Left Side View with the whole, elaborate pediment and decor exhibit more labors on the main register. Hercules and the three-headed warrior Geryon are on the left. The center shows Hercules dragging Cerberus out at the gate of hell. The last scene is of a heroic Hercules and the Apples of Hesperides. Hercules stands in confidence with his lion's skin. He reaches for fruit from a tree with a snake wrapped around the trunk. On the bottom once again kneel the Telamon figures in a pastoral scene. The Roof has large pediments decorated with marble, snake-like garlands of fruit sculpted in the round and carried by cupids.Thomas, Edmund. \\"'Houses of the dead'? Columnar sarcophagi as' micro- architecture'.\\" De Gruyter, 2011. 387-435. http://dro.dur.ac.uk/9411/1/9411.pdf The botanic garland addition is common in sarcophagi and is influenced by the tradition of decorating tombs with herbaceous decor; however, most garlands are carved in a relief, making the Velletri sarcophagus more original with its three dimensional decor.  Function  The act of burying and the use of sarcophagi was a new form of honoring the dead for Romans starting in the 2nd century. The new tradition, however, was more for those who could afford such an elaborate form of burial. The only viewers at the time that truly interacted with it were the loved ones of the deceased. Their interaction consisted only of knowing that the deceased had a comfortable final resting place in the afterworld. This follows the concept of the tomb being a house, and true \\"palace of the dead.\\" The Velletri Sarcophagus looks strikingly similar to the Junius Bassus Sarcophagus in its size, material, architectural form, and even stances of the figures, however Velletri's can be easily identified by the roof's garland decoration. These similarities as well as the fact of the Junius Bassus sarcophagus being made two centuries after the Velletri shows that whoever was encased within was of high importance and social status.  Context  The sarcophagus was found in Velletri, near Rome, Italy, and was created during the Antonine dynasty. Burial, instead of cremation, became particularly popular after Hadrian's death in 138 CE, creating a sharp shift in how Romans honored their dead. It is associated with new ideas of life after death, deriving from growing cults and religions. As for the influences for visual elements, both the gabled roof and the protective layers of marble around the dead lead scholars to believe that the sarcophagus is more of an Asiatic or Greek tradition, rather than Roman. Its architectural style and roof-like lid show that it may be influenced by a sculpture school in Asia Minor; both elements are common features from that school. Others believe that the added elements of Ionic capitols and palmettes disprove the theory of Asiatic influence.

The tunnel is being excavated below the Sela Pass in India on NH 13 component of Trans-Arunachal Highway system. It will reduce the distance between Dirang and Tawang by 10 km. It has a 3-year target target completion date of Feb 2022 after the construction commenced in 2019. The tunnel will provide access to Tawang by an all-weather road in the western region of Arunachal Pradesh throughout the year. The project provides for two tunnels of 1790 m and 475 m lengths. Strategic importance This strategic tunnel is being constructed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) under Project Vartak. It will enhance Indian military's capabilities in combating the threat of China's Western Theater Command opposite India's eastern sector of Line of Actual Control. It will cut the travel time from the Indian Army's IV Corps headquarter at Tezpur to Tawang by at least 10 km or 1 hour and also help make the NH13 an all-weather road to access Tawang which usually gets disconnected during winter. The tunnels would ensure that the 171 km road between Bomdila and Tawang remains accessible in all weather conditions. BRO is also improving the road from Sangestar Tso (north of Tawang) to Bum La Pass on India-China Line of Actual Control (disputed parts of McMahon Line). NH13 has been converted to 2-lane road. Sela pass is located at 4,200 m but the two tunnels are located at the height of 3,000 m (10,000 feet). The tunnel cuts through Sela-Chabrela ridge. A new greenfield alignment 12.37 km long road from the tunnel will meet the existing Balipara-Chaudur-Tawang road on the Nurarang side and the hairpin bends to the Sela Pass will be avoided.

He served as a Professor at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts from 1902 to 1909. Biography by Johnny Roosval @ the Svenskt konstn√§rslexikon, 1952‚Äì1967, Allhems F√∂rlag  Biography  Arborelius was born in Orsa, Sweden. The Arborelius family was originally from Arboga and can be traced to the 16th century. His father, Olof Ulric Arborelius (1791-1868), was a priest and dialectologist. His mother, Charlotta Dorotea Friman (1817-1892), was his father's third wife. His younger brother, Rudolf Arborelius (1861-1917), was an architect. In 1873, he married his cousin, Hedvig Maria Arborelius (1853-1909). His grand-nephew is Roman Catholic cardinal Anders Arborelius. He received a recommendation for the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts from Johan Fredrik H√∂ckert. After seven years of studying there, he took work in the studios of Edward Bergh, but soon received a travel grant that enabled him to embark on a three year study trip to Europe. He visited Paris, Munich and Rome and spent some time in D√ºsseldorf. While in Rome, he became associated with the Virtuosi al Pantheon. When he returned to Stockholm he became a member candidate (agr√©) at the Academy. For many years, he was a Supervisor at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska h√∂gskolan). In 1902, he was appointed a Professor of Landscape Painting at the Academy. He was originally counted as a follower of the D√ºsseldorf School. During the 1880s, he began to express opposition to the prevailing styles of teaching, but never embraced impressionism, although he sharpened the colors in his palette.Biography @ the Svenskt biografiskt lexikon by Gerda Bo√´thius The illustrator, Fritz von Dardel, felt moved to criticize his use of the color green. He made extensive use of folk motifs from Dalarna. At the Venice Biennale of 1903, one of his works was purchased by King Victor Emmanuel. His works may be seen at the Nationalmuseum and the G√∂teborgs konstmuseum, as well as at the Finnish National Gallery in Helsinki.

In his late twenties, Roore had already begun to make regular appearances in the Native Land Court, reciting complex descent lines and possessed of narratives that filled the gaps in the evidence of other Witnesses. In a post confiscation context, there was a huge contest for remaining Maori land blocks and having whakapapa knowledge improved the chances of a successful outcome for the hapu.

Purpose ‚ÄúThe vision of SEALS is to create a virtual library for the Eastern Cape to promote and enhance information literacy, education, research, and economic development for all who need it.‚Äù. History At various stages since 1992, higher educational consortia were formed to foster collaboration between the various previously disparate tertiary institutions. One of these consortia was the Eastern Cape Higher Education Association (ECHEA). These consortia aimed at consolidation efforts in increasing capacity and value within the regions. In this regard academic library consortia were established, with the South East Academic Libraries System (SEALS) cooperative of specific interest to the Eastern Cape region. The original consortium member institutions were the library services of the eight tertiary institutions in the Eastern Cape, including: Fort Hare, Port Elizabeth Technikon, Border Technikon, Vista University, Eastern Cape Technikon, Rhodes University, University of Port Elizabeth, and the University of Transkei. Although established in 1998, the consortium was formally recognised as an academic library consortium in 1999, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation endowed funds to SEALS in 2000 to implement a single shared library management system for all member institutions within SEALS. In 2004 the higher education environment in South Africa was restructured, realigning the previously advantaged and disadvantaged institutions.

It was intended to be a prequel to Orb Of Bengazi, another title that was in development by OMC for the add-on. The Assassin takes place in the future of the year 2147 where the player assume the role of Michael Steele, a detective from Chicago who is put on a trial for killing the perpetrator who murdered his brother Kavanaugh Steele as an act of revenge, but starts delving more in-depth on his investigation and getting caught on a web of deception when looking for answers to questions he was previously not aware of. Conceived and originally in development for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers, the game was later moved to the Jaguar CD after the author of the game came across with unforeseen technical issues with his 8-bit development equipment when moving from United States to Japan. The title was also set to feature an internally developed role-playing game system called Blood City. Although The Assassin was originally planned to be released sometime in 1999, it was later pushed back for release in 2000 but it never materialized in the end, despite reassurances by the developer. In addition to its prequel, OMC Games had three more games in development and planned to be released under their publishing label for the platform that failed to materialize as well.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot from the second demo released, showcasing the conversation system. Gameplay in The Assassin would have revolved around the game world, visiting locations and interacting with the local inhabitants. The first demo that was officially released to the public is not interactive, while the second demo is playable but only to a certain point before gameplay stops. The final game would have made use of the internally developed Blood City RPG system.  Synopsis  The Assassin takes place in the year 2147, where humans coexist with mythological creatures on a futuristic cyberpunk setting. Michael Steele, a human detective of Chicago travels to Austin, Texas in order to investigate the death of his younger brother Kavanaugh, only to find out that he was murdered. As a result, he soon tracks down his brother's assassin and kills the perpetrator without remorse but Michael is later caught and sent to prison, where he is put under trial for his action.  History  James Garvin, an avid video game player and writer had aspirations of entering into the video game industry, while attending his computer engineering studies at The University of Texas at Austin. James began programming in 1982 with TI-BASIC on the TI-99/4A but he then moved on to both Commodore BASIC and Atari BASIC with the 800XL in 1983, and he was later encouraged to become a full-time programmer by learning the Assembly programming language. Some of his inspirations include Paul Murray, Philip Price and Richard Garriott, in addition of being a fan of Atari during his adolescence. The Assassin originally started as a title intended for the Atari 8-bit family, but was later moved to the Atari Jaguar after James came across with technical issues when trying to make his development equipment for the 8-bit computer when moving from USA to Japan. He pitched his project to Atari Corporation but was met with a negative reception from the company, changing his overall outlook about Atari. When Atari Corp. merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover on April 1996, James became an official developer for the Jaguar and received development materials to program games for it. In 1998, OMC Games announced the game to be in production along with two other projects intended for the Atari Jaguar CD, but they later reassured that it would still be released for the Atari 8-bit computers after Hasbro Interactive released the patents and rights to the Jaguar into public domain in 1999 by declaring it as an open platform and opening the doors for homebrew development, allowing independent publisher and developers to release unfinished titles from the system's past life cycle as well as new titles. In an article written by Eric C. Mylonas on \\"The Graveyard\\" section featured in the November 1999 issue of GameFan magazine, he teased the possibility on covering The Assassin, if reception of the issue was positive enough. Despite multiple promises by the developer to deliver the game after various delays due to multiple internal issues within the group, they ultimately ceased its development and left the project unfinished as a result. There were also graphics created by the game's artist that went unused as well.  Release  Although The Assassin was left unfinished, OMC Games released two ROM image demos in 1999 to the public for free to be downloaded and played on the Atari Jaguar with either a Skunkboard flash cartridge or a modified system with the BJL homebrew program loader installed, in addition of emulators that support the Jaguar, among other ways to play it. Richard Turner, owner of the JustClaws website, demonstrated one of the demos of the game during E-JagFest 2000.  Legacy  The Assassin was part of one of the many projects in development by OMC Games for the Atari Jaguar platform and possibly for other systems, as the company had four more titles planned to be released; a sequel to the game titled Orb Of Bengazi, a medieval fantasy action role-playing game called Age Of Darkness, a cyberpunk title similar in gameplay to Ys I & II named Eternal Darkness: Scent Of the Spider, and a shooter game influenced by Ambrosia Software's 1996 space trading and combat simulator Escape Velocity and Treasure's 1998 shoot 'em up Radiant Silvergun titled Dark Guardian Episode 1: Unknown Enemy. Neither project moved beyond the conceptual design phase except Dark Guardian Episode 1, which had an early demo showcased to the public at JagFest 2K1, a small festival dedicated to the system held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Life  Born in Vernaison, from a family of silk merchants in Lyon, Rougier studied the piano and then the organ with √âdouard Commette, organist at the Lyon Cathedral. He then continued his musical studies and learned musical composition with Georges Martin Witkowski, founder of the Soci√©t√© des Grands Concerts.Soci√©t√© des Grands Concerts Home page Mobilized for military service in 1912 and during the First World War, he was wounded several times in the trenches of the Battle of Verdun before joining the Arm√©e fran√ßaise d'Orient until the end of the war. On his return from the front, he went back to music and entered the Schola Cantorum de Paris with Maurice Sergent, Vincent d'Indy and especially Louis Vierne as teachers, whose latter's influence would be predominant in his compositions for organ. The latter also commissioned him to create his Triptych for organ Op. 58Louis Vierne : la vie et l‚Äô≈ìuvre, by Bernard Gavoty, Buchet/Chastel, 1980 with orchestra. In 1921, his symphonic poem Les Elfes won the prize of the musical composition of the Soci√©t√© des Grands Concerts, at the same time as a Sarabande by Pierre-Octave Ferroud and the following year he became conductor of the Hector Berlioz Symphony Concerts in Grenoble.http://www.editions- rubin.com/rougier.html For the 1927/1928 musical season, he did not forget the Lyon scene alongside Paul Le Flem, Andr√© Caplet and Jacques Ibert by premiering En marge de trois ma√Ætres fran√ßais. But Rougier returned to his favourite instrument, the pipe organ and, after an experience as assistant at the Church of Saint-Sulpice and as appointed organist at the Dominicains convent of the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor√© in Paris he became a titular in several parishes in Lyon such as Saint-Ir√©n√©e, Saint-Polycarpe and Saint- Pothin. Back from Paris in the 1920s, he stressed the importance and variety of the organ repertoire by Bach with his former master, √âdouard Commette, who would later make reference recordings of the German master whose work was increasingly popular with the public.\\"Aspects de la musique baroque et classique √† Lyon et en France: Lyon et la musique du XVIe au XXe si√®cle\\", Daniel Paquette, , 1989.

It was at his request that Durufl√©'s Requiem was first performed for solo organ with the composer at the pulpit, the first for large orchestra taking place in 1947, Salle Gaveau, in Paris. In 1937, he was one of the members of the \\"Cercle du Luth\\". with √âdouard Commette, Ennemond Trillat, Jean Bouvard, Robert de Fragny, Ferrier-Jourdain, Pierre Giriat, Marcel Paponaud, Marcel Pehu, Jean Reynaud and Victor Richer, a musical society in Lyon that disappeared during the Second World War.

The club operates four men's teams, a ladies teams and four boy's junior teams (under 13 to under 18). The men's 1st XV currently play in Cumbria 2 - a level 9 league in the English rugby union system. They play home games at the Ellis Road Ground. History Formed in 1877 as 'Workington Football Club', the club had its first ever game in November of that year, a loss against fellow Cumbrian side, Whitehaven, who had themselves formed in 1876. Founded by cricketers looking for a summer game, the club played early fixtures at Valentine Ground, which they shared with Workington Cricket Club. They were based at the cricket club until 1883, when they moved to a former greyhound stadium, Lonsdale Park. In 1890 the club gained its nickname 'Zebras' when Boer War veterans, who were watching a game involving the side, gave the unflattering remark that they played like 'a herd of Zebras', which was (at the time) as much a reflection on the way they played the game as their kit of black and white stripes. Despite early misgivings of the Zebras playing abilities by these visitors the club would go on to win its first major silverware several years later, winning back-to-back Cumberland Shield titles in 1897 and 1898. In 1895 the Northern Football Union was formed, with many northern clubs deciding to leave the Rugby Football Union for this new organisation, including Workington who joined in 1898. Part of the appeal of the Northern Football Union was that it offered the chance for players to earn money from match appearances, which the amateur RFU were dead against. Although Workington were very successful during this period, winning the Cumberland Senior three years running between 1907‚Äì09, the demands of professionalism caused the club to go into voluntary liquidation in 1909 when they merged with another local club, Workington Trades, to form Workington Rugby Union Football Club. This merger also saw the newly formed Workington RUFC return to Valentine Ground. The years after World War I saw Workington enter a golden spell as they became one of the top rugby union clubs in northern England, with the 1st XV winning the Cumberland Cup 5 times in the 1920s and once more in the 1930s. The 2nd XV was also impressive winning the Cumbria Shield twice in the 1920s and then 3 times during the following decade. In 1925 left the Valentine Ground for the second time to move to its new home at the Ellis Road Ground. The Ellis Road Ground was much more impressive than that of the cricket club, with a (then) capacity of 16,000, which included 2,000 seated in the grandstand. During this time the club also produced two England international cups in the Lawson brothers. Following World War II the club would have another period of success in the 1950s and early 1960s before sliding into decline, and by the advent of the leagues in 1987, Workington were ranked in the lower levels of the English rugby union system. Although they won promotion in 1988 they did little until the end of the 1990s, when over a period of three seasons they forced their way up the leagues, gaining promotion from the old North West 3 in 1999, winning North West 2 in 2000 and then finally North Lancashire/Cumbria in 2001, to reach North 1 West, which at tier 7 is the highest level Workington had reached in its history. This also coincided with the club winning its first senior cup for 40 years, winning the (now) Cumbria Cup back-to-back in 2001 and 2002. The good times did not last long as Workington were relegated from North 1 West after just one season and then again from North Lancashire/Cumbria in 2005. Although they have won Cumbria 1 twice (in 2006 and 2016) they have struggled to rise up the leagues, and at the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season they suffered the misfortune of being relegated to Cumbria 2 despite finishing 6th due to restructuring of the Cumbrian regional leagues. Ground Workington RFC have played home games at Ellis Sports Ground since 1925. It is located off Moss Bay Road, next to the Clay Flatts Industrial Estate in the western part of Workington. Access to the ground is good with plenty of parking, and Workington railway station is just a mile away and within walking distance. The capacity of Ellis Sports Ground is around 12,000 which includes 2,000 seated in the stand.

A teacher, noticing Felix's talent in playing the violin, encouraged him to have lessons in London. The family moved to Britain in 1938, and he attended Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School; with a scholarship, he went to the Royal Academy of Music, studying with Rowsby Woof.Felix Kok obituary The Guardian, 26 September 2010.

Encyclopedia Iranical online Also known as the Tafsir Surat Yusuf, this is an essay that was written as a commentary to Surah 12 in the Qur ºan: Surat Yusuf (ÿ≥Ÿàÿ±ÿ© ŸäŸàÿ≥ŸÅ). This composition is similar in its structure to the Qur ºan itself: it contains 111 chapters (Surahs), each of which contains 42 sentences. The name of the essay In the standard English transliteration, the name of the essay is \\"Qayy≈´m al-asmƒÅ'\\". Its meaning in Arabic is \\"the maintainer of the names\\". The names here refer to the 99 names of God in Islam. \\"Existence\\" (qayyum) is the name numbered 63. The book is sometimes called the Surat Yusuf (Surah interpretation of Joseph), or Ahsan al-Qisas (Arabic: best story of all stories), meaning the best story. \\"Ahsan al-Qisas\\" is a well-known name for Surat Yusuf in general and not necessarily related to the interpretation of the B√°b in particular. History Qayy≈´m al-asmƒÅ is considered to be the first long book written by the B√°b after the commencement of his mission. On May 22, 1844, the B√°b proclaimed himself as a divine revelation and emissary, and as the B√°b, or the Mahdi or the messiah whom the Shiites are waiting to return at the end of days to fill the earth with justice after its being filled with oppression, and he who signifies the eschatological age and the end of human history.Denis MacEOIN, The Sources of Early Babi Doctrine and History: A Survey.

Page 55., Brill: Leiden, 1992 According to the claims of B√°bi believers, the writing the book -- hundreds of pages long -- was relatively quick. It is described in their writings that the B√°b wrote the entire book in 40 days, in a kind of ecstasy of divine inspiration. However, academic sources disagree: some believe that the number forty is typological only and does not necessarily indicate a period of exactly forty days,Tod Lawson and Omid Ghaemmaghami. A Most Noble Pattern: Collected Essays on the Writings of the B√°b, ªAl√≠ Muhammad Shirazi (1819-1850). p. 7, George Ronald Bahai Studies Series but that his writing took several months. Qayy≈´m al-asmƒÅ was the central book of the B√°bi faith in its first year. Preachers of the B√°bi faith, like Mullah Hussein Bushru'i, took copies of the essay and distributed it outside of Shiraz.Denis MacEOIN, The Sources of Early Babi Doctrine and History: A Survey. Page 56, Leiden: Brill, 1992 Structure and content of the essay The composition consists of 111 Surahs, similar to the number of verses in the Quranic Surat Yusuf. At the top of each sura appears the basmalah (in Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ≥ŸÖŸÑÿ©), meaning the Muslim saying, \\"Bassem al-lah (al-rahim),\\" which appears at the top of every sura in the Quran, with the exception of the ninth surah. The appearance of this formula, unique to the structure of the Quran, adds to the connection that the author sought to create between the existence of al-Asma and the holy book of Islam. Additionally, one can discern another Quranic characteristic in al-Asma -- at the beginning of the Surahs there appear mysterious separate letters, similar to those in the Quran. This composition is different from any regular interpretation of Surat Yusuf: much of the book deals with the religious and messianic doctrines of the B√°b, with only a slight connection to the Quranic Surah. There are almost no elements in the composition that mention the interpretation of a typical Quran, but it is a kind of new composition that stands by itself. In the few times that the B√°b writes an interpretation of a particular Quaranic verse, this interpretation is in the form of an allegorical and esoteric interpretation -- Tawil (Arabic: ÿ™ÿ£ŸàŸäŸÑ) and not a Tafsir (Arabic: ÿ™ŸÅÿ≥Ÿäÿ±).Exegesis In A·∏µbƒÅrƒ´ and Post-Safavid Esoteric Shi øism. Encyclopedia Iranica online The method of interpretation in the book is allegorical-esoteric and mystical: (Arabic: ÿ™ÿ£ŸàŸäŸÑ) a commentary which is actually a revelation. In this work, the interpretation of the Quran becomes a divine revelation, and revelation is used as a tool for interpretation. The entire composition is inspired by the model of the Quranic style, with a considerable amount of Quranic terminology. For example, in Sura 4 verse 13 in the Qayy≈´m al-asmƒÅ, the B√°b writes: \\"We [the Hidden Imam] have brought down this book about our servant and our servant [the ba'b] [by virtue of] a divine permit [in a form that] resembles [the Quran]ÿ≠ÿ∂ÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿ®ÿå ŸÇŸäŸàŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ŸÖÿßÿ°: ÿ™ŸÅÿ≥Ÿäÿ± ÿ≥Ÿàÿ±ÿ© ŸäŸàÿ≥ŸÅ. 4:13, ÿ™ÿ≠ŸÇŸäŸÇ Ÿàÿ∑ÿ®ÿπ: ÿ≥ŸäŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸÜÿπŸäŸÖŸä, 2008 In the first Surah of the Book, the Hidden Imam says: \\"We have revealed to you [to the B√°b] all that God has revealed to us [the imams].ÿ≠ÿ∂ÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿ®ÿå ŸÇŸäŸàŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ŸÖÿßÿ°: ÿ™ŸÅÿ≥Ÿäÿ± ÿ≥Ÿàÿ±ÿ© ŸäŸàÿ≥ŸÅ. 1:28, ÿ™ÿ≠ŸÇŸäŸÇ Ÿàÿ∑ÿ®ÿπ: ÿ≥ŸäŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸÜÿπŸäŸÖŸä, 2008\\" Here the B√°b is depicted as a mediator between the Hidden Imam and humanity. Along with these 'moderate' statements, one can find in the book 'bold' statements that describe this book as a new revelation from God, that is, as the new Quran. These statements bring the status of the B√°b closer to that of a prophet. Elsewhere in the book one can find verses that proclaim the B√°b as a divine manifestation of himself, i.e., as the Manifestation of God on earth: \\"Indeed I am God, and there is no god but me\\" (Al-Asmaa, Sura 22, 21).

The issues have been rising in recent years, with the rate of suicide increasing for all demographics. It is the leading cause of death for those aged between 10 and 29 years old. Males account for the most suicides at over 66.6% of all suicides. Like most issues of mental illness and death, suicide is generally viewed as a taboo subject in Singapore.This may hinder efforts to reduce suicide rates. Some argue that changing public opinion on clinical depression and similar mental disorders may be a huge step in improving the rate of suicides. Singapore ranked 105th by age-standardised suicide rate according to the World Health Organization in 2016. Generally, the rate of suicide is rising, in 2016 it was 8.54, up from 8.43 in 2015. Legality Suicide was decriminalised in Singapore with the passing of the Criminal Law Reform Bill on 6 May 2019. Before that, Section 309 of the Penal Code stated that \\"Whoever attempts to commit suicide, and does any act towards the commission of such offence, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.\\" The section was rarely enforced, between 2013 and 2015, only 0.6% of reported cases was brought to court. It is still illegal to abet or assist another person in suicide. Section 306 of the Penal Code states that \\"If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.\\" Section 305, also relates to the abetting of suicide, however it is specifically if the suicide victim is less than 18 years old, intoxicated or mentally ill. It states that \\"If any person under 18 years of age, any insane person, any delirious person, any idiot, or any person in a state of intoxication, commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.\\" On 9 September 2018, the Penal Code review committee called for the law on attempted suicide to be repealed. On 6 May 2019, the law was officially amended to decriminalise suicide. Preventive measures There are numerous preventive policies with the intention of reducing suicide. The Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) is a non denominational, non-profit suicide prevention centre. SOS is a member of the National Council of Social Service and is also affiliated to the American Association of Suicidology (AAS), International Association for Suicide Prevention, Befrienders Worldwide, and International Federation of Telephonic Emergency Services (IFOTES). The organisation provides multiple services such as a 24-hour suicide hotline, professional counselling and crisis support. Another measure is outlawing the abetment of suicide. Notable cases A notable case is the slayers suicide pact, also known as the Sheng Long Fu suicides or Singapore teen suicide pact. The suicide pact, which took place on 23 August 2008, had 9 teenagers agreeing to it. On the day of the suicide, one backed out, two committed suicide and the rest backing down after seeing the first suicides. This case shook the island and many were appalled by the incident. Peer pressure and a lack of maturity were blamed for the incident. This case revealed brought media attention to teenage suicides in Singapore and how peer pressure can be used to manipulate the young. Criticism Critics blame Singapore for having high stress levels which lead to a higher amount of suicide. There is also much criticism towards the way Singapore deals with suicide victims and survivors. For example, critics point out the fact that suicide survivors should receive treatment instead of getting punished. They also argue that someone in the state of mind where they consider suicide as an option, likely would not think of legal repercussion as a strong deterrent.

It was noted for manufacturing the Motorette, a three- wheeled miniature vehicle which was marketed as a compact auxiliary alternative to standard cars in more heavily congested areas in the years following World War II, with about 6,000 being produced and sold across the United States, Asia, and Latin America.  History  Incorporated in September 1945, the Motorette Corporation's history traces back to the construction of a predecessor vehicle of what ultimately became the Motorette, which was originally designed by engineer John C. Parkin of the Curtiss-Wright Corporation as a means of quickly traversing that company's one-mile long aircraft plant in Buffalo, New York. However, following the conclusion of World War II, Parkin along with fellow former Curtiss-Wright employees Stephen A. Bucholtz and Kenneth Breckenridge founded the Motorette Corporation to manufacture the vehicle for the commercial market. By March 1946, the Motorette Corporation had four distributors and 28 dealers across the United States. The company produced approximately 6,000 vehicles which were sold throughout the US, particularly in south Florida, and also fulfilled international orders including a 1948 contract that saw 210 Motorettes delivered to an Indian maharajah six months after India's independence from Great Britain, paid for with a $130,000 letter of credit which was the largest such payment issued from the newly independent country at the time. After consecutive years of rapid expansion, the Motorette Corporation ceased production in July 1948 due to changing economic conditions, with its assets being sold at auction for $55,000 to the Delavan Welding Corporation of Buffalo, which discontinued automobile production.  Vehicles  The Motorette was a three wheeled roadster with no doors or top, and an optional windshield.Richard M. Langworth: The Encyclopedia of American Cars 1940-1970. Beekman House, New York 1980. Manufactured for simplicity of use, it sported a two-speed, automatic clutch with push-button electric self-starter, features quite uncommon for the era. It was steered by a handlebar-style wheel, and its mechanical drive brake doubled as a parking brake, limiting the number of pedals to only two. The Motorette further featured a horn as well as distinctive headlights, supported by its 6 volt battery. Its one-wheel (rear left) chain drive was powered by a one-cylinder, four-cycle, 4.1 horsepower, air-cooled Wisconsin engine, which featured no reverse gear but could turn within its own radius or be pushed backward by foot given its relatively light 375 lbs weight. The Motorette measured 90 inches long by 44 inches wide and featured a chrome-steel chassis with aluminum body and 4\\"x8\\" balloon-type tires. It could achieve a top speed of 39 mph and had a one-gallon sized fuel tank with efficiency of approximately 80 mpg. While the engine was mounted in the rear, there was an additional 6 cubic feet of cargo space under the rear hood. It initially sold in the $400-500 range and was available in a choice of four different colors (red, blue, green, and yellow). Comedian Bob Hope was an early owner and sponsor of the Motorette. The Truckette was envisioned as a specialized model of the Motorette tailored for commercial and delivery purposes and began production in 1947. While possessing the same chassis as the Motorette, its more powerful 6 horsepower engine could achieve speeds of 45 mph and it was capable of accommodating a cargo load of up to 500 lbs. Its dimensions were 90\\" x 48\\", only four inches wider than the standard Motorette and identical in length, which was still notably more compact than a typical sedan of the time.

In the upper part, a left hemisphere has been prepared according to Klingler's technique. The arachnoidal layer and the blood vessels were previously removed. In the middle part of the picture the first step of white matter dissection with the exposure of short fibres (U-fibres) which are visible underneath the cerebral cortex. In the lower part, a deeper layer of anatomical dissection with white matter structures (associative and projection fibres) and basal ganglia (Putamen). White matter dissection refers to a special anatomical technique able to reveal the subcortical organization of white matter fibers in the human or animal cadaver brain. The first studies of cerebral white matter (WM) were described by Galen and by the subsequent efforts of Vesalius on human cadaver specimens.Clarke E, O‚ÄôMalley CD. 1968. The Human Brain and Spinal Cord, A Historical Study Illustrated By Writings from Antiquity To The Twentieth Century. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press. The interest for the deep anatomy of the brain pushed anatomist during centuries to create and develop different techniques for specimen preparation and dissection in order to better reveal the complex white matter architectural organization. However, the biggest impact on the dissection of white matter anatomy was made by Joseph Klingler who developed a new method for specimens preparation and dissection. This technique became more feasible and widely used due to an increased quality of dissection and surprising quality of anatomical details.Ludwig E, Klinger J. 1956. Atlas Cerebri Humani. Basel: S. Karger. Klingler developed a new method of brain fixation, by freezing already formalin-fixed brains before dissection. First, the water crystallization induced by freezing disrupts the structure of the grey matter (which has a high water content). This process made possible to peel off the cortex from the brain surface without damaging the subcortical white matter organization underneath. Second, the freezing process along the WM fibers, induced a clear separation between them facilitating the dissection by progressive peeling of the fibers. White matter fibre dissection is nowadays considered as a valuable tool to enhance our knowledge about brain connectivity, and has been used to validate tractographic results and vice versa with good consistency between the two techniques, but also for neurosurgical training and neuroanatomical teaching.

It was launched in 2014 by the New Opportunities for Research Funding Agency Co-operation in Europe (NORFACE) network. Including 15 transnational projects with 250 researchers from 25 European countries, the programme analyzes the societal, economic, political and legal aspects of welfare state development and suggests pathways of its evolution in the future. As a key element of their research, the WSF projects enable and encourage cross-national cooperation, multi-disciplinary research and offer a wide European approach with opportunities for comparison. The programme is coordinated by Scientific Programme Coordinator Prof. Ellen Immergut at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin (HUB)/European University Institute (EUI). It is funded by 15 NORFACE partners and the European Commission under the ERA-Net Plus funding, grant agreement number 618106.https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/111221_en.html After the inception of the WSF Programme, NORFACE has gained 4 new partners, such that there are currently 19 members. More information about the NORFACE network and its partners can be found on the NORFACE website. The final conference including projects of all clusters, policymakers and industry experts was held at the European University Institute (EUI) on May 24‚Äì25, 2018. The Programme ends in June 2019.  Research Clusters = Health = After the end of the cold war, many Eastern European post-Soviet states started to privatize their state-run health systems. At the same time, many Western, Southern and Northern European countries started experimenting with New Public Management and other market-oriented health reforms. The three projects in the Health Cluster (HEALTHDOX and HiNEWS and EXCELC) analyze the causes and consequences of these changing European health policies. The research investigates political determinants of health policy reforms, particularly those that privatize healthcare systems, and consequently focuses on the issue of social risks. It also analyses how reforms in healthcare affect individual attitudes towards the health system and addresses the question of why healthcare inequalities persist despite well-developed and universal health systems. Finally, it analyses how countries respond to changing welfare state preferences and how these preferences can best be measured, for example, in terms of health and long-term care services. = Migration = Migration patterns depend, among other things, on the state of welfare systems in the origin and destination countries. At the same time, due to migrants‚Äô socialization in different welfare regimes and their often disadvantaged socio-economic positions, their perspectives provide a unique opportunity to test the central theories in the field of welfare regimes. Within the European Union (EU), two developments in particular challenge the welfare state: the transnationalization of citizenship and welfare rights and the judicialization of politics. In this context, there are issues of transferability, i.e. the transfer and recognition of the social rights of EU citizens who move from one member state to another. The projects in the Migration cluster (MIFARE, MobileWelfare, TransJudFare, TRANSWEL and UPWEB) integrate the migration dimension into welfare state research. They analyse how welfare systems affect mobility patterns and how transferability of welfare accounts plays into mobility across Europe. They also ask how welfare attitudes differ among migrant groups and how they compare to overall public opinion. Furthermore, they engage in research on how EU member states have responded to the transnationalization of welfare rights and the judicialization of politics. Finally, they ask how social rights of mobile citizens manifest in policy and in practice and in which ways mobile EU citizens experience, organize and manage their welfare transnationally. = Welfare State Attitudes = European welfare states are facing major challenges. Escalating costs, immigration, increasing inequality, international competition as well as populist politics are major challenges that need to be addressed. Personal responsibility is more and more stressed than state responsibility when it comes to the welfare state. However, this logic is questioned by traditional ideas about gender roles, care, and redistribution. New directions in welfare will be shaped by people's aspirations, ideas, and assumptions. The projects in the Welfare State Attitudes cluster (4Is, FPRWS, HEALTHDOX, MIFARE, WelfSOC) seek to explain support for redistribution and determinants of attitudes to welfare among different groups. Furthermore, this cluster investigates how program design shapes welfare attitudes and how an increased ethnic diversity affects the support of the welfare state by its citizens. Lastly, the research addresses questions on fairness and preferences regarding personal responsibility for welfare policies. = Child & Family Welfare = Family policies and social care services are at the intersection of increasingly diverse family situations and complex welfare state environments. There is variation between child protection systems between European countries as well as in how social services address family issues in different service areas. There are also differences in the role of the state in family life and in the ways different welfare states seek to balance children's rights to protection and parents' rights to family life. The projects in the Child & Family Welfare cluster (FACSK and HESTIA) seek to explain the impact of variations in child protection systems among different welfare states and how social work methods in family-based social work vary between welfare states. Furthermore, they investigate how social workers across different contexts understand notions of family and how they describe their practices and outcomes with families. = Globalization, Welfare States & Inequalities = International trade and technology, the integrated European labour market, transnationalization of citizenship and welfare rights, migration as well as persistent social inequalities are all challenges that national welfare states must face in Europe in the 21st century. European welfare states over time developed different methods to protect their households from adverse shocks but differences in the ability of current welfare states to reduce inequalities in the future can also be observed. The projects in the Globalization, Welfare States & Inequalities cluster (4Is, FPRWS, GIWeS, GlobLabWS and TransJudFare) try to identify determinants and patterns of inequality in European welfare states and how citizen's preferences for redistribution and welfare services are formed. Additionally, they analyze the role of welfare state policies in countering labor market and income inequalities, as well as how welfare states meet these challenges. They also ask how concerns for personal responsibility can be integrated in the design of welfare schemes. Lastly, the projects address the questions about fairness, the transnationalization of citizenships and the effects of technological innovations and their interaction with welfare institutions.  NORFACE Welfare State Futures Projects  The WSF Programme consists of 15 transnational projects.

The mission was a part of the \\"softening up\\" campaign Bomber Command conducted prior to the D-Day invasion. The operation was assigned to No. 5 Group, which was joined by No. 1 Group. Estimated a lightly defended target, confusion in the mission plan and communication problems led to the force being held up at the assembly point, where German night fighters slipped in among the bombers. Though the bombers succeeded in destroying the training camp, the victory was achieved at a heavy price. Planning A portrait of Cheshire in 1945 =Mailly chosen as target= The military base at Mailly was just north of the community of Mailly-le-Camp, 80 miles east of Paris along the national road linking Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne to Troyes. It was built in 1902 as a barracks and training ground for the French army. In the 1930s it was used for their armoured formations, but since the fall of France it had been taken over by the Germans and used to train replacement crews for panzer units refitting from losses suffered in the east. In the autumn of 1943 requests to monitor the installation were sent to l'Arm√©e Secr√®te. The organization's Brutus-Nord network was given the assignment of producing detailed plans of the panzer training grounds, and for providing a regularly updated inventory of the German units present.\`In the spring of 1944 the group reported the arrival of elements of the 21st Panzer Division. In April 1944 Bomber Command shifted its bombing campaign from German industrial centers to the destruction of the Wehrmacht's infrastructure in occupied Europe. The new directive was known as the Transport Plan, and was in preparation and support for the D-Day landings. On 2 May Intelligence sent the Mailly target to the Chiefs of Staff Committee, which in turn issued the request to destroy the camp at Mailly to Bomber Command. Bomber Command chief Arthur Harris assigned the mission to Ralph Cochrane and 5 Group. =5 Group Op= 5 Group had developed a low level marking technique that was very accurate. Since proving it to Harris a week earlier in a raid against the railyards at Munich, 5 Group had been given a measure of autonomy from the rest of Bomber Command. Harris had provided four Mosquitos to 617 Squadron to effect their low level marking. In addition, he transferred 627 Squadron (Mosquitos) from the Pathfinder Force, along with the Lancaster formations 83 Squadron and 97 Squadron. With the transfers, 5 Group had its own small marking force. A Mosquito prepares to launch into the night The mission was run the 5 Group way. Unlike a Pathfinder Force guided mission, there was no Master Bomber. The 5 Group method used a Marker Leader who was in charge of marking the target, and a Main Force Controller in charge of the bombing force. In this case, Leonard Cheshire was the Marker Leader. To support him were the four Mosquitos of 617 Squadron, but the rest of 617 Squadron was assigned a practice flight for a deception mission delivering Window at low level. In their place the aircraft backing up Cheshire's target markers were Lancasters from 83 and 97 squadrons, the PFF squadrons newly arrived to 5 Group. In addition, a number of Oboe equipped Mosquitos were assigned to the mission from the Pathfinder Force to drop shielded illumination flares over Mailly, and the yellow marker flares over the assembly point. The Main Force Controller was wing commander Laurence Deane, the CO of 83 Squadron. He was backed up by his Deputy Controller, squadron leader Neville \\"Ned\\" Sparks. The planners hoped to catch the 21st Panzer Division in their barracks. As curfew for troops on the continent was midnight, Cheshire was to drop his target marking flares at 12:01, one minute after soldiers were required to return to barracks. Seeking to gain greater punch, Cochrane called upon Air Vice-Marshal Edward Rice, the CO of 1 Group, and asked him to join his force with Cochrane's for the mission. Like Cochrane, Rice wanted his group to operate independent of the Pathfinder Force, and was developing his own marker force. The unit of 6 Lancasters was called the Special Duty Flight. Cochrane stated that both groups would hit the depot buildings, but enticed Rice by noting the base had a tank repair facility that was a special target. The target could be destroyed by the aircraft of a couple squadrons, and could be marked by Rice's Special Duty Flight. Cheshire had worked out his marking technique with 617 Squadron, with Cheshire or Martin marking, while the rest of the squadron waited to hear from him before coming over the target one at a time at altitude. The seeds for disaster were sown with 5 Group's hasty preparation, the lack of a clear understanding of the mission in the minds of the various flight leaders, a lack of familiarity with Cheshire's method, and problems that developed in radio communication that were not apparent until the Main Force Controller was over the target. The wireless operator at his post aboard a Lancaster Throughout the bombing campaign against Germany, Bomber Command aircraft had used HF for Radio Transmission on those occasions when radio silence was broken. The primary use was for the PFF Master Bomber to guide in the Main Force bombers during an attack. These were one-way conversations, and radio discipline was maintained. Cochrane had learned that Fighter Command had switched to VHF as it gave a clearer transmission of voice between aircraft. Never one to allow a technical advance to pass by him, Cochrane converted 5 Group to VHF as well. It was the belief of 5 Group planners that 1 Group was still using HF, so it was decided that Deane would transmit his orders to the bombing force by Wireless Transmission in Morse. Ironically, unbeknownst to Cochrane, Rice had followed his lead and converted 1 Group to VHF. Worse, a Wireless Operator was not a part of the crew in the Mosquito. Cheshire would not be able to communicate to the Main Force by wireless. =Mission plan= With only a day to prepare, 5 Group planners were very busy setting out all that needed to be accomplished before the aircraft took off for their targets. The plans for the mission were hurriedly put together. A route to target was picked, fuel requirements calculated, bombing heights set and bomb loads worked out. The route took the bombers south from Lincolnshire, climbing as they crossed over England and turning southwest over Reading. Continuing on they would reach Beachy Head, where they would head out over the Channel. Continuing to climb, they would reach 12,000 feet before reaching the French coast, crossing it north of Dieppe. Here they would turn slightly to the north, and make their 156-mile trek across northern France, losing altitude along the way, to reach the assembly point 15 miles north of Mailly-le-Camp. The location would be marked with yellow flares by Oboe equipped Mosquitos from the Pathfinder Force. From the assembly point the bombers would fly due south to the target, drop their bombs on the markers present and exit to the south. Continuing on for ten miles, they would reach Troyes. Here they would make a 90 degree turn to the west and head toward Fontainebleau. At Fontainebleau their course would bend slightly to the north, passing by Chartres on the way to a pinpoint near Flers. There they would make a second 90 degree turn, coming north to Bayeux 20 miles northwest of Caen, heading back across the Channel for Selsey Bill and England. Ground crews refuelling and bombing up an Avro Lancaster. The bomb load includes a 4,000-lb HC 'cookie' The bombing of the target could not be completed in the normal fashion for two main reasons. First, there was a French village nearby. Casualties among French civilians were to be kept to a minimum. It was decided to use a low bombing altitude to improve accuracy and avoid casualties among the French. Secondly, the marker aircraft would be using Cheshire's low level marking technique. For every thousand pounds of HE in a bomb, a heavy bomber had to have a thousand feet of clearance above the blast to avoid being knocked down by it. It was worse for a Mosquito. A Mosquito at 5,000 feet or less was unlikely to survive the bomb blast of a 4,000 pound cookie going off below it. The initial laying down of markers was not a problem, but if a second aiming point was needed mid-mission, the bombing would have to be halted while the new markers were being laid on if the marker crews were to survive their mission. Bomb loads were set at one 4,000-pound \\"cookie\\", with 15 or 16 500 pound HE bombs, depending on the distance of the plane's field to the target. Though incendiaries usually made up 50% of the bomb load against a German city, no incendiaries were used on this raid. In addition, though a normal bombing mission over Germany would be flown at 18,000 to 21,000 feet, the raid to Mailly would be flown much lower. Bombing height would be from 6,000 to 8,000 feet to minimize scatter and improve accuracy. The low altitude of the bombers would place them in range of light flak, but the lowest aircraft would still be 2,000 feet above the height of the bomb blast shock delivered by the \\"cookies\\". The mission was to unfold as follows: just before midnight Mosquitos from PFF were to drop shielded illumination flares over Mailly-le-Camp, using Oboe to confirm their location. Time on target was 12:01, when Cheshire would mark the east end of the camp. He had 6 minutes to check and reset these markers. If satisfied he would signal the Main Force Controller, Laurence Deane. Deane would call in the 173 Lancasters of 5 Group to bomb with the signal \\"Rat One, bomb\\". Over the next 6 minutes they would drop their loads upon the east end markers. After the first wave of bombers had passed over the target the bombing would be halted, while Cheshire used the next 9 minutes to return over Mailly and mark the west end of the camp. Now at 12:20, the marker aircraft would get out of the way and the second wave of 140 Lancasters from 1 Group would be called in with the signal \\"Rat Two, bomb\\". Over the next 6 minutes they would drop their bomb loads over the target. By 12:26 all aircraft would be out of the target area. An assembly point was set up 15 miles north of Mailly near Germinon. Three 627 Squadron Mosquitos were assigned to keep the assembly point marked by yellow target indicator flares. As aircraft arrived they would make large left hand circles there until they received word that the target was accurately marked, so they could begin their bomb runs. Being a target in France, little resistance was expected. The Met prediction was for clear skies and a 3/4 moon. One Commanding Officer said it would be like falling off a log. \\"Just go in, wipe it off the map and come home.\\" The mission was expected to be the proverbial \\"piece of cake.\\" Said wireless operator Ron Story of 166 Squadron \\"We were to bomb from 8,000 feet. On reaching the assembly point, we were to circle the avenue of flames, and await the instructions from the Master Bomber who would give the go ahead to head for the target and bomb precisely on the markers. It all sounded so simple, and we were in such good spirits.\\" Though the target itself would not be heavily defended by Flak placements, a problem lay in the fact that four German night fighter airbases were within easy reach of the assembly point: III/NJG-1 at Athies-sous-Laon, I/NJG-4 at Florennes, II/NJG-4 at Coulommiers, III/NJG-4 at Athies, plus III/NJG-5 and I/NJG-5 at St. Dizier. Of the 92 aircraft on inventory for these units, approximately 60 could be expected to be serviceable at any one time. In reviewing the mission, author and former RAF bomber pilot Jack Currie noted \\"That a planning staff could contemplate, or a commander countenance, any plan of action in which a possibility existed - even a remote one - of several hundred fully-laden Lancasters orbiting a marker, in bright moonlight, within striking range of at least four night-fighter bases, staggers the imagination. That criticism, however, is formed with the advantage of hindsight. It is clear that, at the time, no one saw reason to expect a disaster.\\" As in any mission, delays near the target area could prove costly. The raid=Flight out= A Lancaster stands ready to launch into the night At 21:45 ten squadrons from 5 Group began to take to the air, followed shortly by seven more from 1 Group. They headed south, gaining altitude while leaving behind the farmlands of Lincolnshire. They passed above Beachy Head and continued to climb as they crossed the Channel. To minimize exposure to German Flak batteries along the coast, they crossed into France at 12,000 feet just north of Dieppe. They then began a slow descent to 7,000 feet, reaching the assembly point beacon 15 miles north of the target. Some 20 minutes after the bombers left their bases Cheshire and his four marker Mosquitos of 617 Squadron took off in pursuit. Piloting the Mosquitos along with Cheshire were Dave Shannon, David Kearns and Gerry Fawke. In the dark of night they did not fly together, but each aircraft navigated to the target on its own. Each would catch up with the main force and pass them, arriving over the training camp solo and early. Backing them were the two former PFF squadrons, 83 and 97, which would act as back up marker units. Cheshire was over the target 8 minutes before he was to mark the target. To avoid alerting the training camp, he flew on to St. Dizier and made a few passes over the night fighter base there to give the appearance of an intruder flight. Shannon had to put a few dog legs in his approach to burn off time. At the assembly point Mosquitos of 627 Squadron dropped yellow Target Indicator flares. The aircraft of the two groups of heavy bombers were to orbit the assembly marker as they arrived until the target was correctly marked. First to arrive were the aircraft of 5 Group, which made up the first wave. The aircraft were stacked at altitudes of 100 feet separation. The arriving bombers began to make their large left hand circles about the marker while they awaited the signal to commence their bomb runs. =Marking Mailly= The night was clear. Arriving on time, Shannon's position was confirmed by his navigator, who added \\"We're here Dave, but where are the Oboe flares?\\" An instant later a set of hooded illumination flares lit up the scene. The flares had been dropped by PFF Mosquitos at 5,000 feet, providing excellent visibility. A moment later Shannon witnessed Cheshire dropping his red target flares at the east end of the camp. Shannon circled at 3,5000 feet until he was called in to repeat the marking. The marker flares had been dropped accurately, and burned brightly at the east end of the target. Satisfied with the marking, Cheshire radioed Deane, the Main Force Controller, to initiate the attack. Unknown to him, Deane was having difficulty receiving him. He did see the marking was accurate, and instructed his wireless operator to give the order to start the attack. He then circled above and waited for the destruction to begin. Nothing happened. No one received his transmission. =Milling at the assembly point= Bf 110 night-fighter is prepared for combat While the bombers circled at the assembly point Luftwaffe nightfighters began to arrive on the scene, slipping in among the circling Lancasters. With their arrival losses began to mount, and impatience and indiscipline among the pilots began to set in. Radio silence, normally strictly observed, went by the wayside as pilots succumbed to the anxiety and frustration and gave voice to their displeasure. In Deane's post-action report he recounted \\"The order that RT silence be maintained was now being broken from all quarters, and the gist of the many messages addressed to me, some orderly but many others crudely blunt, was to inquire when they could bomb and get the hell out.\\" One pilot was heard to say \\"Come on Master Bomber, pull your finger out\\" Though he heard them, his orders were to maintain radio silence, and he did so. Instead, he had his wireless operator repeat continuously the order to attack. After 5 or 6 minutes, the aircraft of 5 Group began making their attack runs. How this came about is not clear, as no one received the WT transmissions from Deane. The point of an attack plan is to get the aircraft over the target and out of the danger area in the shortest amount of time possible. The delay of a few minutes may not seem like much, but it proved costly. The air combat over the assembly point was short, but intense. Crews reported seeing four or five Lancasters falling from the sky at a time. Sergeant Frank Broughton, the wireless operator in a 97 Squadron aircraft, slid out of his seat to take a peak out of the astrodome. There had been nothing in his briefing for him to expect the Main Force Controller to broadcast his orders by WT. In the next few minutes he witnessed six large explosions in their immediate vicinity, and realized that Lancasters were being blown to pieces all about him. \\"By heck, this is a bit rough\\" he offered. The stream of aircraft orbiting the assembly point grew in size as the aircraft from 1 Group arrived on the scene. One of these was C-Charlie from 12 Squadron. Rear gunner Sergeant Dick Woodruff likened the scene to a swarm of gnats on a warm summer evening. The sky above the yellow markers was thick with Lancasters, and C-Charlie was in the middle of them. Ceaselessly swinging his turret from side to side, he saw twin- engined Messerschmitts and Junkers flying past, witnessed combat after combat, and saw one Lancaster after another fall out of the sky. He and the mid-upper gunner fired bursts at the passing shadows. A Lancaster moved close enough for him to see the large letters PH on the side of the fuselage, his own 12 Squadron code. In grim silence he witnessed the aircraft get caught in a stream of cannon fire, catch fire and fall to the earth. A Bf 110 nightfighter pilot is secured in prior to launch Receiving no word to attack, Sparks assumed Deane had been shot down and took control. He began signaling the force to attack, initially with wireless signal, and then by radio transmission. Adding to the difficulties, there was a great deal of interference on their radio frequency. In an unfortunate twist of fate, US Armed Services Radio was broadcasting big band swing music that night on the same RT frequency that the RAF was using for the raid. Whether from the urging of Sparks or on their own initiative, 5 Group bombers started to deliver their loads on the target. The initial bombing was accurate and reasonably well concentrated. Meanwhile, over the assembly point losses continued to mount. Said Cheshire: \\"I had never seen so many aircraft going down in so short a space of time, and I knew that this could only be because most of the available Luftwaffe night fighters were in the sky. With the bright moon and clear sky our aircraft would have little chance. To this day I can remember my near despair at finding no way of getting through either to the Controller or directly to the aircraft themselves.\\" Weighing up the situation, Cheshire attempted to call off the attack and return the bombers to home. Cheshire reflected later \\"I was desperately trying to call the whole attack off, and none of the main force could hear me. They were not used to this method, and they were not receiving us.\\" By 00:16 the 5 Group aircraft should have completed their bombing runs and the Mosquitos of 617 Squadron should have had a clear run to place their second set of markers at the west end of the target. In fact, almost 2/3 of the first wave had yet to exit the assembly point. Nevertheless, it was time to mark again. Realizing this, Sparks attempted to halt the bombing, ordering his crews \\"Do not bomb - Wait.\\" He was only partially successful. =Marking the western end= A low flying Lancaster is seen through the glare of a burning Mailly-le-Camp As the time for the second marking approached Fawke and Keane maneuvered their Mosquitos to make their run. Not realizing there was a second marking point to be illuminated, Deane took this moment to attempt to refresh the original red markers. Flying his Lancaster across the target area at 2,000 feet, he believed there would be a pause in the bombing to allow the remarking of the east end. Unfortunately, no real pause occurred. He soon found his aircraft being tossed about mercilessly. \\"Never have I had such a rough flight in a Lancaster. It did everything but stand upright on its tail as each stick of bombs exploded underneath us. I discovered later that the aircraft of 1 Group were carrying 4,000 pounders, for which the safe height was 4,000 feet.\\" It would seem Deane was unfamiliar with the bomb loads detailed for the mission. Every aircraft in both Groups assigned to bomb the target carried a 4,000-pound blockbuster, along with 15 or 16 HE bombs. The only exceptions were those in the marker squadrons, Deane's own 83 Squadron and 97 Squadron. Observing the destruction going on at the assembly point, Cheshire wanted the whole force to just drop their bombs upon the east end markers. However, he was unable to raise Deane, so Cheshire ordered Kearns and Fawke to drop their secondary markers on the west end of the target as originally planned. Diving in from 5,000 feet, the two Mosquitos were soon buffeted by the ongoing explosions underneath them. At a quarter the weight of a Lancaster, the Mosquitos were tossed about much more violently. Fawke abandoned any thought of attempting a low level marking and released his flares at 2,000 feet, while Kearns let go at 3,000 feet. Even so, Kearns barely made it out. \\"I had just released my markers, checked 'bombs gone' and bomb-doors closed, when a bomb load exploded right in front of me. I don't even recall the next few seconds clearly, other than bright flashes, severe turbulence and the Mosquito being thrown all over the sky.\\" After a few dicey moments he managed to regain control. Finding his navigator was uninjured, he pointed his aircraft for Woodhall Spa and home. =Remaining bomber force cleared to attack= As Kearns left Mailly the target area was cleared. The majority of 5 Group was still orbiting at the assembly point, as was most of all of 1 Group. Finally came the order which the pilots had been waiting for. \\"Rat Two, bomb. Come on, all you insolent bastards, everybody - bomb!\\" Most thought it was the voice of Cheshire, but in fact it was the Deputy Controller Neville Sparks. The time was 12:24, 15 minutes after they were scheduled to go in. Somehow the message got through. Said one pilot \\"When the order to attack was finally given, the waiting area looked like the starting post of the Epsom Derby.\\" The force of heavy bombers headed to the target en masse, and the full weight of high explosives were dropped upon the camp. The recriminations ceased and the radios went silent, while the force headed south and away. Within the camp the second pounding was far more intense than the first. The camp had a number of shelters and zig-zag slit trenches dug 6 feet deep to offer the panzer troops some measure of protection were the camp to come under attack. They were adequate protection against flying splinters, but were little help against the concussive blast of a 4,000-pound cookie. As the raid progressed the explosions caused the sides of the trenches to cave in, half burying the men inside. Survivors were faced with the dilemma of digging themselves out and being exposed, or staying half buried and hoping not to suffocate. After 15 minutes from the start of the bombing there was a sudden lessening in intensity. The shouts of NCOs could be heard calling out \\"All soldiers not in possession of their weapons, ammunition and field kits go and get them now. The rest of you - fight the fires. Move!\\" Those that could do so and hurried to obey were soon caught in the open by a far more intense second phase of bombardment. From the French town of Mailly-le-Camp the view of the night sky was shocking. Claudette Marc recalled \\"Everything was illuminated brightly, and there was a constant hum in the sky. In the distance you could hear powerful explosions, and it seemed to us that in addition to the bombing, there was an intense air battle going on. Though it was just after midnight, it seemed like daybreak had already arrived. My parents were impressed, as were many of the residents of Faux-Fresnay.\\" For many 1 Group crews, the order to bomb came too late. However, the Panzer training camp at Mailly-le-Camp was devastated. The losses in buildings, materials and men were heavy. This was the kind of destruction German cities had been suffering under for over a year, but it was the first time the soldiers of the Wehrmacht were exposed to the heavy delivery of bombs that Bomber Command was beginning to master. With bombs released the bombers began their return flight home, but continued to be pursued by German fighters. Some battles continued all the way to the coast. Remaining over the target until the last bombs had been dropped, the aircraft of Deputy Controller Sparks was caught by a night fighter and shot down. Aftermath A badly damaged Lancaster managed to make it back to England following the Mailly-le-Camp mission 467 Squadron in 'Naughty Nan'. Dickson's Lancaster was lost near Mertz during his return flight from Mailly. It was one of 42 lost on the raid. Dickson and four others aboard were killed The mission against the Panzer training center at Mailly-le-Camp was just one mission in a series of missions to soften up the German defenses in preparation for the D-Day landings. At Mailly had been a Panzer regiment headquarters unit, three panzer battalions that were refitting from units on the East Front, elements of two other panzer battalions, and the camp's training staff. Once underway, the bombing was accurate. Some 1,500 tons of high explosives were delivered on the camp, causing massive destruction. The training base at Mailly-le-Camp was largely leveled. Destroyed in the bombing were 114 barrack buildings, 47 transport sheds, 65 vehicles, and 37 tanks, while 218 instructors and soldiers were killed with 156 more being wounded. The success of the mission came at a grievous cost. 42 Lancasters and their crews were lost, with another Lancaster written off upon returning to base. 5 Group lost 14 bombers on the mission, while 1 Group, making up the second wave, lost 28 aircraft. Communication problems were at the heart of their troubles. Unbeknownst to Deane, his wireless set was 30 kilocycles off frequency, making his Morse coded instructions over the WT unreadable. Many crews were not even aware that instructions from the Main Force Controller were to come over the wireless. Communication difficulties were exacerbated by interference from an American Armed Forces radio broadcast, whose powerful transmission was on the same channel as the RT for the bombardment groups. The delay in the attack by just a few minutes allowed the German night fighters to get in among the bombers, resulting in heavy casualties. At 11.6%, the loss rate was prohibitive. Such losses were as bad as those suffered in the hardest raids flown against such heavily defended targets as Berlin or the Ruhr. However, the losses were suffered in a much shorter period of time. The majority of the air combat occurred at the assembly point, and was over in 30 minutes. A number of experten who were able to slip in among the bombers were able to make multiple kills close together. Dietrich Schmidt of 8/NJG-1 scored 3 victories in 30 minutes before damage to his aircraft from defensive fire required he and his crew to bail out. Martin Drewes of III/NJG-1 achieved 5 victories in 45 minutes. Helmut Bergman of 8/NJG-4 scored 6 victories in 30 minutes. Fw 190s of I/SKG-10 accounted for six victories. The intensity of the combat was the most notable feature of the air battle. Non-military casualties were few. Post-war investigations by the RAF confirmed that none of the bombs dropped fell in the nearby French towns. The civilian deaths that did occur, including the 16 that died in Poivres and the 5 at Trouan-le-Petit in the Aube, were killed when they were struck by the debris of destroyed aircraft. A week later on 10 May 1944 a 5 Group mission to Lille had to be paused in mid mission when the target indicators were extinguished by bomb explosions. During the delay of remarking 12 bombers were shot down, a 13% loss rate. Following these two missions the 1/3 op rule for missions to France was abandoned. The mission gave critics the chance to claim Cheshire's low level marking technique would not work for Main Force operations without grievous loss. However, Cheshire was not in charge of the bombing mission. That was the responsibility of Deane. Cheshire was only placed in charge of the marking of the target, which was completed on time and accurately. The fact that the two men attended separate briefings may have contributed to the confusion over the target, as neither one seemed fully aware of the full picture, including the involvement of 1 Group's Special Duty Flight, which had been assigned its own marking target. The problem of delay was due to confusion over the execution of the mission, amplified by the communication break down between the controllers and the bombers. Said Cheshire \\"You have got to have good communications.\\" Afterwards, Rice bitterly regretted having committed his Group to this mission. His fledgling marker unit was disbanded two months later, and the crews returned to the main bombing force. In February 1945 Rice was replaced by Air Vice Marshal Robert Blucke. Rice was transferred to the command of No. 7 (Operational Training) Group, which handled the heavy conversion units. On the men that flew the mission, Jack Currie had this to offer: Some crews of shot down aircraft survived, including that of the Deputy Controller Ned Sparks. Shot down as he began to exit the target area, he and his crew were all able to parachute to safety. Sparks was able to link up with the French Resistance and made it back to England seven weeks later. His arrival at RAF Coningsby came as a complete surprise, as no one thought he would be seen again, and a celebration was thrown in his honour. Sparks received no recognition from the Air Ministry for his service at Mailly. Most of the 258 airmen who were killed are buried in Mailly-le-Camp and the surrounding villages. An annual commemorative service for the airmen, the French civilians who lost their lives and the French Resistance is held in Mailly-le-Camp.

She was sentenced to 40 years in prison for aggravated homicide in 2011 after having a miscarriage. She served 4 and a half years of her sentence before being released. In March 2017, Rivera and her 12-year-old son were given asylum by the Swedish Migration Agency in fear that a prosecutor's appeal of the decision to release her might lead to her returning to prison. There has been a blanket ban on abortion in El Salvador since 1998. Five other Latin American countries have similar bans, including Chile, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua and Suriname. She is now advocating for Sexual Reproductive Rights (SRR Rights) in EI Salvador while in Sweden, with Amnesty Sweden and others.  Early life  Rivera is from a small village called La Libertad. During the Civil War, her mother vanished; Rivera was 8 years old at the time. At the age of 8, Rivera was attacked and raped by a stranger while walking at night. After this incident, she and her brother went to live in an orphanage near the capital. She completed high school education and worked in factories and retail jobs. In May 2005, she had a baby boy. The relationship between Rivera and the baby's father broke down due to domestic violence. Rivera and her ex-mother-in-law maintained a strong relationship and brought up Rivera's son together.  Court case  The judge in Rivera's case noted two pieces of evidence before giving a guilty verdict. Rivera's factory boss gave a testimony of how Rivera had confided in him in January 2011 suspecting she was pregnant. The judge concluded that Rivera was, therefore, aware of her pregnancy. The baby's autopsy report stated that the baby had been full term and died of prenatal asphyxiation. The judge inferred that the cause of asphyxiation was intentional smothering. He sentenced Rivera to 40 years imprisonment. Rivera disputed the judge's decision, saying had she known about the pregnancy she would have done everything possible to protect the baby.  Prison  While in the overcrowded prison Rivera was often called \\"baby killer\\". She did small jobs in the prison such as cleaning toilets and collecting rubbish to earn some money. During her time in prison, she saw her son twice. The CFDA mounted a legal defence against Rivera's imprisonment but these appeals were rejected. According to Amnesty International, Rivera shared a prison cell with 250 people. On 20 May 2016, she was released from prison following a court decision to overturn her conviction.  After prison  On her release, she thanked Amnesty International supporters for campaigning for her release; > \\"I have been sharing my experience with others ‚Äì and thanking God that I am > not there [in prison] anymore. I am very grateful to every man and woman who > has been following my case, with that lighted candle, and who hoped that I > would be free. That gave me so much strength, because if you believed it on > the outside, I had to believe it too. In El Salvador justice has been served > and this needs to happen again with my \\"compa√±eras\\". I ask everyone - men > and women who followed my case ‚Äì to support them. I will also join you. I > don‚Äôt have the economic means, but I have the moral strength to help make > them feel strong by keeping alive the hope that they will also be free, and > that justice will be done.\\" 26 women have been imprisoned for allegedly inducing miscarriages and are serving between 30 and 40-year prison sentences. Such cases, some known as the \\"Las 17\\", have received media attention in El Salvador and internationally. She was the third woman of \\"Las 17\\" to be released. Following her release she found it difficult to get a job and was known as a \\"baby killer\\". The Attorney General said the decision to release Maria Teresa Rivera would be appealed. Swedish authorities granted Rivera asylum on 17 March 2017. She was the first person granted asylum in Sweden based on persecution following defying an abortion ban. Rivera was given immigration housing for herself and her son by the Swedish government.

Background After the Byzantine annihilation of a Seljuq Turkish army at the Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir in 1177, the Byzantines laid waste to Turkish lands along the Meander river. Emperor Manuel I Komnenos drove out Turkish forces encamped near Lakerion and Panasion. A Byzantine attempt to capture the town of Charax failed when the Byzantine commander, Andronikos Doukas Angelos, panicked after facing a few Turks in the night and led his entire force in a rout. Siege In February 1179, the Turks laid siege to the town of Claudiopolis in northern Bithynia. The Byzantine garrison was prevented from sallying out. The defending forces threatened the emperor with a capitulation unless prompt help arrived, claiming to not have the strength to withstand a siege attack or starvation blockade. Manuel set out for Claudiopolis with an army a day after receiving the message. He proceeded via Nicomedia, with only his horse and armor, unburdened by imperial luxuries. The emperor slept little and rested on the ground, earning him the admiration of his men. Upon catching sight of the approaching Byzantine banners and glittering armaments, the surprised Turks turned tail and fled. Manuel did not let up, pursuing them back to their lands. Aftermath The Byzantine success demonstrated that the frontier in Anatolia remained intact. Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with the Seljuqs by the end of 1179.

Jennifer Price (1940 - 16 May 2019) was an archaeologist and academic, specialising in the study of Roman glass. She was professor emerita in the department of archaeology at Durham University. Early life Price was from a family of glassmakers in Stourbridge. She initially attended evening classes in archaeology whilst at secondary school and excavated with Graham Webster in her free time. Career She briefly left archaeology, working for the civil service before qualifying as a Barrister in 1963. From 1963-1966 she worked on excavations in Italy and Masada, Israel. Whilst at Masade she learned how to reconstruct and study Roman glass vessels. She subsequently gained her bachelor's degree in archaeology from Cardiff University in 1969. From 1969 to 1972, Price was in Spain undertaking her PhD research into Roman glass. She was awarded her PhD in 1982 from Cardiff University, with her thesis on 'Roman Glass in Spain'. Price worked in the British Museum from 1972-1973 before returning to Cardiff to teach prehistory. In 1977 she became the Keeper of the Salisbury Museum. In 1980 she became Lecturer in Archaeology at the University of Leeds. In 1990 she moved to Durham University where she taught provincial Roman archaeology, eventually earning a personal chair in the department of archaeology as well as serving as the head of the department for three years. Price was a longstanding member of the Yorkshire Archaeological Society and served on its council and house & finance committee. She served as the Chair of Roman Archaeology Section of the society from 1991 to 2008, succeeding Herman Ramm in the post. In 1988, along with her partner Sue Hardman, and the other researcher Stephen Briggs and Peter Wilson, Price published a Festschrift for Mary Kitson Clark, a leading female authority on Roman Yorkshire titled Recent Research in Roman Yorkshire: studies in honour of Mary Kitson Clark (Mrs Derwas Chitty). Price conclusively identified a Roman glass shard excavated at Chedworth Roman villa in 2017, by matching the fragment to a restored fish-shaped bottle held by the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. This showed that the bottle was made in the Black Sea area, and is the only vessel of its kind ever found in Britain, making it startlingly rare. Her discovery gives further insight into the wealth and status of the inhabitants of Chedworth. =Awards and honours= She was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 2 March 1978. In 2006, to mark her retirement, a two-day conference was held in her honour by the Association for the History of Glass. A 2015 collection of papers, titled Glass of the Roman World was also dedicated to Price. Select publications *Price, J, Wilson, P, Hardman, S., and Briggs, S. (eds) 1988.

First introduced in 2013, unicity is measured by the number of points p needed to uniquely identify an individual in a data set. The fewer points needed, the more unique the traces are and the easier they would be to re-identify using outside information. In a high- dimensional, human behavioural data set, such as mobile phone meta-data, for each person, there exists potentially thousands of different records. In the case of mobile phone meta-data, credit card transaction histories and many other types of personal data, this information includes the time and location of an individual. In research, unicity is widely used to illustrate the re- identifiability of anonymous data sets. In 2013 researchers from the MIT Media Lab showed that only 4 points needed to uniquely identify 95% of individual trajectories in a de-identified data set of 1.5 million mobility trajectories. These points were location-time pairs that appeared with the resolution of 1 hour and 0.15 km¬≤ to 15 km¬≤. These results were shown to hold true for credit card transaction data as well with 4 points being enough to re-identify 90% of trajectories. Further research shown that the unicity of the apps installed by people on their smartphones, the trajectories of vehicles, mobile phone data from Boston and Singapore, and, public transport data in Singapore obtained from smartcards. Measuring unicity Unicity (\\\\varepsilon_p) is formally defined as the expected value of the fraction of uniquely identifiable trajectories, given p points selected from those trajectories uniformly at random. A full computation of \\\\varepsilon_p of a data set D requires picking p points uniformly at random from each trajectory T_i \\\\in D, and then checking whether or not any other trajectory also contains those p points. Averaging over all possible sets of p points for each trajectory results in a value for \\\\varepsilon_p. This is usually prohibitively expensive as it requires considering every possible set of p points for each trajectory in the data set ‚Äî trajectories that sometimes contain thousands of points. Instead, unicity is usually estimated using sampling techniques. Specifically, given a data set D, the estimated unicity is computed by sampling from D a fraction of the trajectories S and then checking whether each of the trajectories T_j \\\\in S are unique in D given p randomly selected points from each T_j. The fraction of S that is uniquely identifiable is then the unicity estimate.

Design and development The PWS-103 was the third and last glider built by PWS, based in Bia≈Ça Podlaska. Like the first two it was designed by the experienced Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski, with the assistance of J√≥zef Niespa≈Ç who had also collaborated on the PWS-102. It was a high performance, gull wing, wooden, single-seat sailplane, which incorporated much learned from the PWS-101 and particularly from the PWS-102, but had a smaller span () than the earlier, designs. The gull wing of the PWS-103 was high-mounted and had only moderate central dihedral. In plan it was straight-tapered out to long, elliptical tips. It was built around a forward main spar and a rear auxiliary spar, joined by two-ply sheet to form a box-spar. Each wing had split, differential, fabric-covered ailerons mounted on the auxiliary spar. Underwing IAW airbrakes replaced the camber-changing inboard flaps and DFS airbrakes of the PWS-102. The plywood semi-monocoque, oval section fuselage of the PWS-103 was very similar to that of the PWS-102 though slightly shorter. The cockpit glazing extended smoothly rearwards from the nose to the wing leading edge. Behind the wing the fuselage tapered to an integral, ply-covered, curved fin with a broad, fabric-covered rudder. The elliptical plan horizontal tail, with its ply-covered tailplane and fabric-covered split elevators, was mounted on top of the fuselage. Landing gear was the usual under-fuselage skid and tailskid. Operational history Sources differ over the date of the first flight of the PWS-103. According to Cynk, this took place in August 1939, piloted by Zbigniew ≈ªabski. Samolotypolskie cites a later work by Glass as saying neither of two prototypes was finished before the Soviet invasion of northern Poland late in September 1939. In this account they were completed in Poland over the winter then in early 1940 moved to Moscow where they were highly rated by the Soviet pilots who tested them.

He was assigned to a desk job in MI5, from where he was sent to Italy, where he spent the rest of the war. He returned to London in early 1919, and after another gall stone attack, he underwent an operation to remove his gall bladder. He was demobilised in September 1919.Stephen Foote, \\"Cook, novelist, soldier, Spy: The WW1 Career of Ralph Durand\\", The Review of the Guernsey Society, Winter 2014 Librarian In 1929, Ralph Durand successfully applied for the post of Librarian at the Priaulx Library. He continued to write and publish books, and was elected to the Council of La Soci√©t√© Guernesiaise, contributing articles on Guernsey history to their journal, Transactions. Stephen Foote, introduction to Guernsey Under German Rule, 2nd edition, Guernsey Society, 2018 World War 2 In 1940, when German forces occupied the island, Durand was asked by the Bailiff, Victor Carey, to keep an official account of the period. His account focuses on the impact of the occupation on the civilian population, and provides a harrowing account of the shortages of fuel and food, which became particularly acute in the period after D-Day, when the liberation of Normandy cut off German supply lines.Stephen Foote, introduction to Guernsey Under German Rule, 2nd edition, Guernsey Society, 2018 After the confiscation of radio sets in 1942, Durand also became part of the Guernsey Underground News Service (GUNS), which secretly distributed transcripts of BBC news around the island. Durand used to conceal a copy of each news sheet inside a specially-appointed book within the library for islanders to read.Stephen Foote, introduction to Guernsey Under German Rule, 2nd edition, Guernsey Society, 2018 Durand's account Guernsey Under German Rule was originally scheduled for publication in late 1945, but was delayed, firstly due to post-war shortages of printing materials and staff, and then by the death of the author in December 1945. It was eventually published in June 1946 by the Guernsey Society. Although it quickly went out of print, it has been widely recognised as an important account of this period. Ambrose Sherwill (later Sir), who was President of the Controlling Committee in 1940, and became Bailiff of Guernsey shortly after the war, wrote: > I greatly regret that Ralph Durand‚Äôs Guernsey Under German Rule published by > the Guernsey Society is long since out of print.

His death certificate records the cause of death as '\\"acute bronchitis, asthma and cardiac failure\\"', but the effects of malnutrition, particularly during the last year of the occupation, had left him very weak. He was buried in the Maingay vault, the family of his paternal grandmother, in Candie Cemetery, St Peter Port.

Added to the inventory of monuments historiques, its fa√ßades and roofs have been protected since 18 October 1971 and the castle in its entirety since 8 April 2009.Ministry of Culture: Manoir de Matval  History  The Merovingian castrum, named Matoval, was destroyed by the Normans in the 10th century. This Merovingian domain had been founded in the 6th century by King Childebert I, son of Clovis I. The grandson of Charlemagne came here to take refuge. In 1459, the fiefdom was given to Jean, illegitimate son of Louis, Count of Vend√¥me, and the present castle was built by the powerful counts of Bourbon Vend√¥me, ancestors of King Henri IV to whom the castle later belonged. Under Louis XIV, the Marquis de Louvois, his famous Minister of War, made it his home, followed by a succession of notable people including Napoleon II. Matval is equally renowned as the origin of the rennet apple variety, reinettes du Mans. In effect, Childebert I, having brought grafts of apple trees from Spain, planted them himself in his park, creating what became the most famous apple in France. It is said that the reinettes du Mans were so-named in honour of the two daughters of the King, the \\"R√©ginettes\\".  Architecture  Entry to the Merovingian mint. The counter on the right represents King Clovis surmounted by his three sons The castle's vestiges testify to an architecture specific to the military buildings of thei time. The south-eastern corner of the house is a wall pierced by arrowslits, remains of a construction provided with arrowslits and a bret√®che, which connected the building to a round tower. Underground galleries run under the hill and the castle. The Merovingian mint is a reminder that the domain was royal and that coins were minted here. The statuette by the entrance is a jewel of the Merovingian age and unique in Europe. The manor with its round tower, the motte and its troglodytic habitation were listed as monument historiques on 18 November 1971. The chapel built against the motte, the grounds of the inner courtyards, the ditches and the lower courtyard were added on 8 April 2009.

It served as the high school for black students until the public schools were integrated. History Freedman's School For Blacks, later known as Dunbar School was built in Brownsville in the 1860s with money raised from local black residents as the first public school for African- Americans. The principal was John Gloster, and the assistant principal was George Currie. It served children in grades 1 through 8 before the building was destroyed in a fire sometime between 1910 and 1920. Education continued for several years, housed in three local churches, Farmer Chapel C.M.E., First Baptist, and Holiness (Brick Sanctified). In 1922, the school was rebuilt, with financial assistance from the Rosenwald fund, and was renamed the Haywood County Training School. In addition to accommodating children, the school also helped returning war veterans complete their education. From 1916 to 1963, Professor Jeffries served as principal. Reflecting the agricultural focus of the school, he was known as \\"the agriculture man\\", and in 1936 became Haywood County's first Negro Agricultural Extension Agent. In 1950, a new high school was built, and named George Washington Carver High School, with principal Roy Bond, who served as principal until the last class graduated in 1970. When the schools were integrated, the high school students moved to Haywood High School, while the younger children were transferred to the newly built Eastside Elementary School. Carver's peak enrollment was over 1,600 students, accompanied by a staff of over 50. The buildings were located within the Dunbar-Carver Historic District Includes 19 photos (see photo captions page 27). and the former high school is now the site of the Dunbar Carver Museum of African-American history.
