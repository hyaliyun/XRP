Thus, their primary venue continues to be astronomical telescopes.

Works  A Taste of Blackberries by Doris Buchanan Smith. Illustrated by Charles Robinson. First Edition. Doris Buchanan Smith's, A Taste of Blackberries (HarperCollins, 1973), earned critical acclaim as well as comparisons with Charlotte's Web (HarperCollins, 1952). In the early 1970s, along with authors such as Katherine Paterson and Judy Blume, Smith established \\"a solid reputation for accessible fiction with serious themes.\\" A Taste of Blackberries \\"deals honestly and emphatically with the range of emotions,\\" wrote Cynthia Westway in The Atlanta Journal, 1973, \\"... the story is not, however an elegy; but a celebration of the continuity of the life- death cycle.\\" David Rees, in The Times Literary Supplement, 1975, declared, \\"It will be difficult to find a children's book this autumn by a new author as good as Doris Buchanan Smith's A Taste of Blackberries.\\" \\"It blazed the way for the many other grief books that quickly followed, but few have approached the place of honor this one holds,\\" wrote Jim Trelease in The Read-Aloud Handbook (Penguin, Sixth Edition, 2006). A Taste of Blackberries won the Josette Frank Award, the Georgia Children's Book Award, and the Best Children's Book Prize (of a translated work) in the Netherlands (Zilveren Griffel). It is an ALA Notable Children's Book, a Newbery Medal finalist, and has been translated into Dutch, Danish, French, Spanish and Japanese. In a review for the School Library Journal (2002), Ann Welton wrote that Smith's book is \\"rightfully viewed, along with Katherine Paterson's Bridge to Terabithia, 1977, as one of the seminal children's books on the subject of death.\\" Return to Bitter Creek, 1986, received the Parents' Choice Award, and was named a School Library Journal and Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year. Last Was Lloyd, 1981, was a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year. Smith also wrote Voyages, 1980, The First Hard Times, 1983 and The Pennywhistle Tree, 1991, all named ALA Notable Children's Books by the American Library Association. Smith's last published work was Remember the Red Shouldered Hawk, in 1994.  Biography  Doris Jean Buchanan was born June 1, 1934 in Washington, D.C. to parents Charles A. and Flora R. Buchanan. At the age of two she began memorizing nursery rhymes her mother read to her, and then inventing stories of her own. At nine, her family moved from the nation's capital, to Atlanta, Georgia. Noticing that she had a flair for storytelling, a sixth-grade teacher, Miss Pruitt (to whom A Taste of Blackberries is dedicated), asked Doris if she planned on becoming a writer one day. The suggestion resonated and a \\"closet\\" writer was born. The next year her parents divorced, leaving Doris and her brothers Bob and Jim to be reared by their mother. While attending South Georgia College, Douglas, Georgia, Doris met R. Carroll Smith. Neither of them completed their courses, and in December 1954 they were married. The Smiths settled in Brunswick, Georgia, where they raised four children of their own and cared for dozens of foster children, including one whom they reared from age 12 to adulthood. After the author's youngest child entered public school, Smith began to focus on her writing, joining a writers group and attending writers conferences while honing her craft. Smith's first completed novel was never published, but her second, A Taste of Blackberries, became a children's classic, which has remained in print since 1973. Smith's marriage ended in divorce in 1977. She remained single until meeting her second husband, Dr. William J. \\"Bill\\" Curtis, an Associate Professor of Education at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, while at a writer's conference in Hawaii. They were married from 1990 until Curtis' death in 1997 from ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease). Doris Buchanan Smith succumbed to cancer in August, 2002. Of her 17 books, only A Taste of Blackberries remains in print. When Publishers Weekly asked children's editors to name a book they wish they had published, Deborah Brodie, former Executive Editor of Roaring Brook Press, named A Taste of Blackberries, remembering its impact; \\"Near the end of the book, when Jamie's mother accepts the basket of blackberries his friend has picked, she says, 'I'll bake a pie. And you be sure to come slam the door for me now and then.' The slam of that door reverberates still.\\"  References   External links  * Doris Buchanan Smith Papers Hargrett Rare Book & Manuscript Library University of Georgia * Doris Buchanan Smith Papers University of Minnesota * Georgia Center for the Book Honors Doris Buchanan Smith * HarperCollins' Children's Books, A Taste of Blackberries * New York Times Book Review March 4, 1990 of \\"Voyages\\" * Zilveren Griffel - Dutch Award * Zilveren Griffel Library Thing 1934 births 2002 deaths 20th-century American novelists 20th-century American women writers American children's writers American women novelists Deaths from cancer in Florida Writers from Washington, D.C.

The effects of this phenomenon on people experiencing these media are often profound, leading them to behave and to respond to these experiences in unexpected ways, most of which they are completely unaware of.Reeves and Nass, 1996 Originally based on the research of Clifford Nass and Byron Reeves at Stanford University, the theory explains that people tend to respond to media as they would either to another person (by being polite, cooperative, attributing personality characteristics such as aggressiveness, humor, expertise, and even gender) ‚Äì or to places and phenomena in the physical world ‚Äì depending on the cues they receive from the media. Numerous studies that have evolved from the research in psychology, social science and other fields indicate that this type of reaction is automatic, unavoidable, and happens more often than people realize. Reeves and Nass (1996) argue that, ‚ÄúIndividuals‚Äô interactions with computers, television, and new media are fundamentally social and natural, just like interactions in real life,‚Äù (p. 5). The Media Equation Test (1996) Reeves and Nass established two rules before the test- when a computer asks a user about itself, the user will give more positive responses than when a different computer asks the same questions. They expected people to be less variable with their responses when they took a test and then answered a questionnaire on the same computer. They wanted to see that computers, although not human, can implement social responses. The independent variable was the computer (there are 2 in the test), and the dependent variable was the evaluation responses. The control was a pen-and-paper questionnaire. Reeves and Nass designed an experiment in which 22 people come to a laboratory and told them they would be working with a computer to learn about random facts of American pop culture. At the end of the session they would ask them to evaluate the computer that they used. They would have to tell Reeves and Nass how they felt about that computer and how well it performed. 20 facts were presented in each session, and participants would answer if they knew ‚Äúa great deal, somewhat, or very little‚Äù about the statement. After the session, participants were tested on the material and told which questions they had answered correctly or incorrectly. This computer, computer #1, then made a statement of its own performance, always stating that it ‚Äúdid a good job‚Äù. Participants were then divided into 2 groups to evaluate the computer's performance and participants were asked to describe this performance from the choice of about 20 adjectives. Half of the participants were assigned to evaluate on computer #1, the computer that praised its own work. The other half were sent to another computer across the room to evaluate computer#1's performance. The conclusion resulted in evaluations done on computer #1 after testing on computer #1 yielded much more positive responses about the session. Evaluations completed on the other computer after testing on computer #1 resulted in much more varied and more negative responses about the session. For the control, the pen-and-paper questionnaire, the evaluations had similar results to that of evaluations done on computer #2. Respondents felt more comfortable being honest when a different computer or paper asked about the sessions completed on computer #1. It is as if participants were talking behind the computer 1's back- not being honest to it, but then expressing more honesty to a third party evaluator. Reeves and Nass found that participants had automatic social reactions during the test. Reeves and Nass ran the test again but added a voice speaker to both computers that would verbally communicate information to make the human-social theme more explicit. The test resulted in almost exactly the same results. They concluded that people are polite to computers in both verbal and textual scenarios. The respondents did not need much of a cue to respond socially to the computers. The experiment supports the hypothesis that social rules can apply to media and computers can be social initiators. Participants denied being intentionally polite to the computer, but the results suggest differently. Propositions The media equation relies on eight propositions derived from the research:Reeves and Nass, 1996 #Everyone responds socially and naturally to media ‚Äì The media equation applies to everyone regardless of their experience, education level, age, technology proficiency, or cultures. #Media are more similar than different ‚Äì Psychologically speaking, a computer is not much different from a television and a sophisticated version of a technology is remarkably similar to a simpler version of the technology. As Reeves and Nass (1996) say, ‚Äúsocial and natural responses come from people, not from media themselves,‚Äù (p. 252). In other words, the media does not make people react the way they do. #The media equation is automatic ‚Äì Since the media equation assumes that responses are ‚Äúsocial and natural‚Äù then these reactions occur automatically without conscious effort. This can occur with minimal prompting. #Many different responses characterize the media equation ‚Äì The media equation occurs even with the most passive uses of media. When using any type of media, a person is likely to assign it a personality, pay extra attention to it, or even assess its personality. #What seems true is more important than what is true ‚Äì Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality. A person can know that a computer is a box made of wires and processors but can still assign a personality to it. The important point to remember is that these responses are just part of being human and participating in a communication event. #People respond to what is present ‚Äì Despite knowing that the media merely provide a symbolic version of the world, people still tend to respond to what the media appears to be as if it were real and immediately present. For the most part, people are more concerned with the interpretation of cues or messages they receive, rather than trying to determine the original intention of the message's creators. #People like simplicity ‚Äì The need for simplicity and to reduce complexity is an innate human need. People are comfortable with simple. Simplicity indicates a level of predictability that makes people more comfortable. #Social and natural is easy ‚Äì When interacting with media, Reeves and Nass (1996) argue, ‚Äúpeople should be able to use what comes naturally ‚Äì rules for social relationships and rules for navigating the physical world,‚Äù (p. 255). People already know how to function in the natural world (be polite, how to handle difficult personalities) so designers should take these reactions and phenomena into consideration when designing new media. Research-based findings The assumptions and conclusions of the media equation are based on a rigorous research agenda that relies on objective empirical data using reliable social science research methods. As Reeves and Nass (1996) explain, ‚ÄúOur strategy for learning about media was to go to the social science section of the library, find theories and experiments about human-human interaction ‚Äì and then borrow‚Ä¶Take out a pen, cross out ‚Äòhuman‚Äô or ‚Äòenvironment‚Äô and substitute media. When we did this, all of the predictions and experiments led to the media equation: People's responses to media are fundamentally social and natural,‚Äù (p. 251). The empirical data to support the media equation is thorough and expansive. Studies have tested a wide variety of communication characteristics with the media ‚Äì manners, personality, emotion, social roles and form. Below are explanations of some of the more interesting findings that support the media equation. =Politeness= Politeness is one measure that researchers have used to study human-computer interaction. Being polite is an automatic response in most interpersonal interactions. When a person asks a question about themselves, most people will give a positive response, even if it may be a dishonest answer, to avoid hurting the other person's feelings. To test this idea with human-computer interaction, researchers designed an experiment in which participants would work with a computer on a tutoring exercise.Nass, Moon, and Carney, 1999 The computer would provide them with a fact about American culture and then provide supplemental information. The computer then prompted participants to take a test to evaluate what they have learned. After completing the tests participants were asked to evaluate the computer's performance. The participants were assigned to one of three conditions ‚Äì a pencil and paper evaluation, an evaluation on a different computer, or an evaluation on the same computer. The results indicate that participants who were asked to evaluate the same computer gave the computer more positive feedback than the other two conditions. To learn more about this experiment, see Nass, Moon, & Carney, 1999.Nass, Moon, and Carney, 1999 =Negativity= In psychology there is a law of hedonic asymmetry that says evaluations of good and bad are important but not the same; negative experiences tend to dominate. In other words, people tend to dwell on the negative more than the positive.Reeves and Nass, 1996 Responses to negative situations are automatic and require more attention to process than positive experiences. Allocating more resources to process negative information takes away from resources available to process positive information, thus impeding one's ability to remember events preceding the negative event. The media equation suggests that people have a similar experience when they encounter a negative experience with media. A study was developed to examine the idea that ‚Äúnegative images retroactively inhibit memory for material that precedes them, while they proactively enhance memory for material that follows them,‚Äù (Newhagen & Reeves, 1992, p. 25). In other words, will watching negative images on the news prevent someone from remembering information that they learned just prior to viewing the negative material? And conversely, will they better remember information they received just after viewing the negative material? In the study,Newhagen and Reeves, 1992 researchers created two versions of the same news story ‚Äì one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20-minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered the second half of the newscast than the part preceding the negative images. The findings of this study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences. For a more in depth look at this study, see Newhagen & Reeves, 1992.Newhagen and Reeves, 1992 =Teammates= Psychology has demonstrated that being a part of a team has a direct influence on attitude and behavior of team members. Members of a team think they are more similar to each other than people on the outside. There are two main characteristics that define team interactions ‚Äì identity and interdependence. For a group to become a team the members must identify with each other and exhibit some degree of interdependence on each other. These two characteristics were tested to determine if a computer can be a teammate. In this study,Nass, Fogg, Moon, 1996 participants were assigned to one of two conditions. In the first condition they would be paired with a computer and would become the blue team. The computer had a blue sticker and the human wore a blue wristband to signify that they were in fact a team. The second condition was blue individual, in which a person would use a computer but they were not considered teammates, rather the computer was just a resource. The task was to complete a ‚ÄúDesert Survival Guide‚Äù activity in which participants rank items they deem most important if they were left on a deserted island. Human participants initially completed the activity on their own and then completed it using a computer (either as a teammate where both the computer and human were evaluated or just using the computer as a resource). Finally, the participants were allowed to revise their rankings, if they wished to do so. The results of this study indicated that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate viewed the computer as more like them, worked in a similar style to their own, was more cooperative and friendlier than people who worked individually. Another finding of this study showed that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate were more likely to change their behavior and conform to the group ideal even when the teammate was a computer. This study supports the notion that developing a sense of interdependency is the key to establishing team affiliation. For a more detailed account of this study, see Nass, Fogg, & Moon, 1996.Nass, Fogg, Moon, 1996 These are just a few of the many studies that support the media equation. For more in depth reading on this subject and past studies, see the ‚ÄúFurther Reading‚Äù section at the end of this article. Alternative explanations Some alternative explanations for the media equation have been proposed. But, as Nass and Moon (2000)Nass and Moon, 2000 argue, these explanations do not add up to the body of empirical evidence that supports media equation. One explanation is that people attribute human characteristics to computers, also known as anthropomorphism. Nass and Moon (2000) refute this claim, saying, ‚ÄúParticipants in our experiment were adult, experienced computer users. When debriefed, they insisted that they would never respond socially to a computer, and vehemently denied the specific behavior they had in fact exhibited during the experiments,‚Äù (p. 93). A second argument against media equation is that participants are actually responding to the programmers behind the computer. Nass and Moon (2000) refute this argument by citing that studies involving multiple computers generally found differences in interactions from computer to computer. If a person was interacting with the programmer behind the computer, then there would be no difference in interaction between computers. Critics have also argued that the way the experiments and questionnaires were designed in the Stanford research may have predisposed their subjects to interact socially with technology. Nass and Moon (2000) counter-argued by saying that the experiments were not misleading. None of the computers used in the experiments were personalized; the computer never referred to itself as ‚ÄúI‚Äù and participants interacted with simple text on a screen. =Grice's Maxims= Reeves and Nass explain that H. Paul Grice's maxims for politeness are perhaps the most generally accepted rules on politeness communication and that Grice's rules are a vital basis to explaining the media equation. The four principles consist of Quality, Quantity, Clarity, and Relevance. Reeves and Nass used these principles to help explain how they believed computers could be social actors. Quality refers to how information presented in a conversation should have value, truth, and importance. Quantity refers to how speakers in interaction should present just the right amount of information to make the conversation as useful as possible. Too much or too little information may damage value of information. Reeves and Nass argue that quantity is not something social media executed very well; they feel it causes frustration because computers display too much or too little information to humans when trying to communicate. Relevance refers to the content of information being translated into an interaction- this information should be both relevant and on-topic. Reeves and Nass argue that computers should be customizable so the user has control over relevance, and they observed how computers struggle to respond to wishes or goals of the user. Reeves and Nass argue that Grice's maxims are vital guidelines to the media equation because violations of these rules have a social significance. If one side of social interaction violates a rule, it may come off to the other party as a lack of attention being paid, or a diminishing of the importance of the conversation; in other words, they get offended. This leads to a negative consequence for both the party that violated a rule and to the value of conversation.

As a moveable feast, the bank holidays for Easter (Good Friday and Easter Monday) can occur any day between 20 March and 26 April. Since the early May Day bank holiday was introduced in 1978 it has occasionally fallen on the Monday immediately after Easter Monday. As this was due to happen in 2011, many forward-thinking workers were able to book four days of holiday that in reality meant 11 days off work. On 23 November 2010, Buckingham Palace announced that the date of the Wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton was to be 29 April; and that it would be a Bank Holiday, thus reducing the need for holiday entitlement to three days.Those workers fortunate enough to be able to earn flexi time (i.e., working an extra hour a day for a period of time and thus earn an extra day‚Äôs holiday) even managed to reduce it to two. Curiously, there has been an 11-day weekend in the United Kingdom before: in Scotland between 25 December 1999 and 4 January 2000, a period which contained five bank holidays.

This concept casts doubts on global empathy, which assumes that empathy is \\"feeling in oneself the feelings of others\\" and is not specifically targeting any one group (e.g. age, gender, and ethnicity) or context.Rasoal, C., Jungert, T., Hau, S., Stiwne, E. e., & Andersson, G. (2009). Ethnocultural empathy among students in health care education. Evaluation & Health Professions 32(3), 300-313. Ethnocultural empathy, on the other hand, assumes that empathy toward others probably increases if the other is similar to oneself in terms of ethnicity, gender, age, or cultural background.  Concept history  Traditionally, empathy is roughly defined as an intellectual ability of taking the role or perspective of another person and/or an emotional response to another person with the same emotional display.Gladstein, G. A. (1977). Empathy and counseling outcome: An empirical and conceptual review. The Counseling Psychologist, 6(4), 70-79. As a part of personal traits, empathy has been established as relatively stable and consistent within a certain time period.Mangione, S., Kane, G. C., Caruso, J. W., Gonnella, J. S., Nasca, T. J., & Hojat, M, (2002). Assessment of empathy in different years of internal medicine training. Medical Teacher, 24, 370-373.Unger, L. S., & Thunuluri, L. K., (1997). Trait empathy and continuous helping: The case of voluntarism. Journal of Social Behavior and Personality, 12, 785-800. However, increasing research found that people usually hold different levels of empathy toward different individuals based on perceived psychological similarity. Two primary factors influencing the psychological similarity are ethnics and culture. Particularly, people usually feel more empathetic towards individuals who are in the same ethnic/cultural groups as they are than those who are not. QuintanaQuintana, S. M. (1994). A model of ethnic perspective-taking ability applied to Mexican-American children and youth. International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 18, 419-448. defined ethnic perspective taking as a cognitive‚Äìdevelopmental ability that could be reached as an individual proceeds through developmental life stages.DeAngelis, T. (2001). All you need is contact. Monitor on Psychology, 32(10), 61.Quintana, S. M., Castaneda- English, P., & Ybarra, V. C. (1999). Role of perspective-taking abilities and ethnic socialization in development of adolescent ethnic identity. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 9, 161-184. This development contains five stages of ethnic perspective-taking ability, including (1) physicalistic and observable perspective, (2) literal perspective, (3) non-literal and social perspective, (4) group perspective and (5) multicultural perspective of ethnicity. First, children begin to establish their ethnic identity by distinguishing themselves from other ethnic groups based on physical features. Once children understand the physical differences with other groups, they then are able to become aware of the perspectives, attitudes, experiences shared by other ethnic groups, and finally develop the ability to take the perspective of other ethnic groups.Quintana, S. M., Castaneda-English, P., & Ybarra, V. C. (1999). Role of perspective-taking abilities and ethnic socialization in development of adolescent ethnic identity. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 9, 161-184. Ridley and LingleRidley, C. R., & Lingle, D. W. (1996). Cultural empathy in multicultural counseling: A multidimensional process model. In P. B. P. J. G. Draguns (Ed.), Counseling across cultures (4th ed., pp. 21‚Äì46). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. have defined cultural empathy as a \\"learned ability\\" which is composed of three subordinate processes: cognitive, affective, and communicative. Cognitive process can be understood as a cultural perspective- taking and cultural self‚Äìother differentiation. Affective process includes vicarious affect and the expressive concern. Communicative process includes probing for insight and conveying accurate understanding. Based on the ethnic perspective of perception and culture difference of empathy, Wang and her colleagueWang, Y. W., Davidson, M. M., Yakushko, O. F., Savoy, H. B., Tan, J. A., & Bleier, J. K. (2003). The Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy: Development, validation, and reliability. Journal of Consulting Psychology, 50(2), 221-234. posed the concept \\"ethnocultural empathy\\". Although this is a new concept, many previous research had addressed similar or related constructs although never formally terms it. Thus, concepts such as cultural empathy,Ridley, C. R., & Lingle, D. W. (1996). Cultural empathy in multicultural counseling: A multidimensional process model. In P. B. P. J. G. Draguns (Ed.), Counseling across cultures (4th ed., pp. 21‚Äì46).

Cross- cultural evaluation of ethnic perspective-taking ability: An exploratory investigation with U.S. Latino and Guatemalan Latino Children. Cultural Diversity & Ethnic Minority Psychology, 6, 334-351. are usually used interchangeably with \\"ethnocultural empathy\\".  Constructs and measurements  To date, the Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy (SEE) is the only formally published measurement of ethnocultural empathy.Wang, Y. W., Davidson, M. M., Yakushko, O. F., Savoy, H. B., Tan, J. A., & Bleier, J. K. (2003). The Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy: Development, validation, and reliability. Journal of Consulting Psychology, 50(2), 221-234. SEE is composed of three instrumental aspects: intellectual empathy, empathic emotions, and the communication of those two. Intellectual empathy is the ability to understand a racially or ethnically different person's thinking and/or feeling. It is also the ability to perceive the world as the other person does; that is, racial or ethnic perspective taking. The empathic emotions component of ethnocultural empathy is attention to the feeling of a person or persons from another ethnocultural group to the degree that one is able to feel the other's emotional condition from the point of view of that person's racial or ethnic culture. In addition, it refers to a person's emotional response to the emotional display of a person or persons from another ethnocultural group. The communicative empathy component is the expression of ethnocultural empathic thoughts (intellectual empathy) and feelings (empathic emotions) toward members of racial and ethnic groups different from one's own. This component can be expressed through words or actions.  Application  Ethnocultural empathy is usually applied in cross-culture and/or cross-ethnics analysis. The levels of ethnocultural empathy were reported to vary by demographic features and societal factors. Previous research indicated that women were more likely to report higher level of ethnocultural empathy than men,Cundiff, N. L., & Komarraju, M. (2008). Gender differences in ethnocultural empathy and attitudes toward men and women in authority. Journal of Leadership & Organizational Studies, 15(1), 5-15.Wang, Y. W., Davidson, M. M., Yakushko, O. F., Savoy, H. B., Tan, J. A., & Bleier, J. K. (2003). The Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy: Development, validation, and reliability. Journal of Consulting Psychology, 50(2), 221-234. Non-White individuals were found to have significantly higher levels of general and specific ethnocultural empathy than their White counterparts. Racism was negatively associated with ethnocultural empathy.Spanierman, L. B., Poteat, V. P., Beer, A. M., & Armstrong, P. I. (2006). Psychosocial costs of racism to Whites: Exploring patterns through cluster analysis. Journal of Counseling Psychology, 53, 434-441. People with different levels of ethnocultural empathy were also reported to respond distinctively to individuals who are similar with themselves and those who are not. For example, people with higher level of enthnocultural empathy had been found to work more successfully with individuals from other cultures.Van der Zee, K. I., & Van Oudenhoven, J. P. (2000). The multicultural personality questionnaire: A multidimensional instrument of multicultural effectiveness. European Journal of Personality, 14, 291-309. Enthnocultural empathy not only functioned in cross-cultural context, but was also extended to a variety of situations, such as majorities vs. minorities, males vs. females, natives vs. non-natives. High levels of enthocultural empathy were reported to be predictive of positive attitude towards minority groups, such as rape victims,Sakalh-Ugurlu, N., Yalcin, Z. S., & Glick, P. (2007). Ambivalent sexism, belief in a just world, and empathy as predictors of Turkish students' attitude toward rape victims. Sex Roles, 57, 889-895. domestic violence victims,Jones, C. D. (2005).

It was first detected by the Swift Gamma- Ray Burst Mission on March 28, 2011. The event occurred in the center of a small galaxy in the Draco constellation, about 3.8 billion light-years away. Studied by dozens of telescopes, it is one of the most puzzling cosmic blasts of high-energy radiation ever observed when it comes to brightness, variability and durability. It probably occurred when a star wandered too close to the central black hole in the galaxy, and was gravitationally torn apart and swallowed by it. Timing considerations suggest that the tidally disrupted star was a white dwarf and not a regular main sequence star. Debris now encircles the black hole in an accretion disk, which launches bipolar jets at near the speed of light. Jet plasma emits the Œ≥- and X-rays. The beam of radiation from one of these jets points directly toward Earth, enhancing the apparent brightness. Repetitive dimming and softening of the X-rays implies that the jet temporarily tilts away from us, due to precession of the warped disk. The jets drive shocks into the surrounding interstellar medium, resulting in a radio to infrared afterglow. Detection of the relativistically expanding afterglow confirmed the identity of the host galaxy. Observed linear polarization of the infrared radiation is consistent with synchrotron emission from the afterglow shock. \\"This is truly different from any explosive event we have seen before,\\" said Joshua Bloom of the University of California at Berkeley, the lead author of the study published in the June 2011 issue of Science.

In theory, the hoarding of millions of toll-free telephone numbers is prohibited by CFR 2010 Title 47 section ¬ß 52.105 Warehousing and ¬ß 52.107 Hoarding. The latter section states, in part: # Toll free subscribers shall not hoard toll free numbers. # No person or entity shall acquire a toll free number for the purpose of selling the toll free number to another entity or to a person for a fee. # Routing multiple toll free numbers to a single toll free subscriber will create a rebuttable presumption that the toll free subscriber is hoarding or brokering toll free numbers.CFR 2010 Title 47 ¬ß 52.107 Hoarding The Federal Communications Commission, which is responsible for the CFR Title 47 regulation, has never taken formal action against PrimeTel.

The current congregation is a merger of two of the oldest congregations in Toronto - Anshei Stashov (founded 1905) and Chevra Knesseth Israel Anshei Slipia (founded 1908).Speisman, Stephen. The Jews of Toronto: A History to 1937. McClelland and Stewart: Toronto. p. 101. History By 1910, there were 18,000 Jews in Toronto, an over 500% increase in one decade. Among the thousands who poured in fleeing pogroms and poverty were men, and sometimes families, from two small Polish shtetlach of Staszow and Slipi. Unable to speak English, they clustered in areas that other Jews frequented. Life was not easy for these immigrants. Some found work as peddlers, others as tailors or small scale businessmen. To ease the loneliness, people from the same town - called in Yiddish - sought each other. They tried hard to rebuild a new life in a cold city that did not care much for Jews or other immigrants. For many, one of the best ways to recreate a small part of what they had left behind was to form a small synagogue, commonly called a shul. By 1910, each organization had officially created one, often meeting in a series of temporary quarters. These small congregational homes served functions beyond prayer. They were meeting places, a small \\"piece of der alte Heim\\" (their homes in Poland) where they could converse in Yiddish, read letters from home to each other, talk about their \\"Canadian\\" children who were doing so well at school, and boast of how their hard earned incomes were being used to bring in more family members. The onset of the First World War stopped immigration for a while, but the gates of Canada reopened, albeit more reluctantly, in the 1920s, thus allowing the small congregations to continue growing. As the congregations grew and felt more secure, they purchased houses - the Stashover on Dundas Street near Spadina and the Slipia on Oxford Street - and converted them into shuls. Rabbi Graubart arrived from Staszow shortly after the war. He was a respected and learned man who authored books on Jewish law, opened a Yeshiva, became Principal of the Eitz Chaim School on D'Arcy Street, and a source of pride to his congregants. Their pride was such that even the economic challenges of the Depression could not close congregational doors. But the shadow of the Shoah fell across the communities, and indeed upon all Canadian Jewry. In 1945 the awful truth became clear: both Staszow and Slipi were Judenrein‚Äîemptied of Jews after centuries of residence. A few souls and few families, remnants of far larger clans, trickled into Toronto and joined their . They arrived just as the Jewish community began to move northwards into the suburbs. By the early 1960s both the Stashover and Slipia Congregations found downtown membership dwindling. The Stashover moved first‚Äîto the building we occupy today on Sultana Avenue. They were joined a few years later by the Slipia Congregation. Through the 1960s and 1970s, the shul thrived in the vibrant centre of Toronto Jewish life. But as the numbers of the second generation members dwindled, and their children attended less often, a slow decline began. Services fell from twice a day to twice a week, and \\"waiting for minyan\\" - the 10 men needed to make a quorum for public prayer - became frequent on Shabbat. Something had to be done. And it was. In 2007 the older generation generously and willingly called upon their successors to take over their legacy. Together, both generations, aided by new members attracted by our traditional friendly and familial atmosphere, reinvigorated the congregation. Services Today the Stashover-Slipia Congregation holds services Shabbat mornings, Sunday mornings and on Yom Tov (holiday).

Life He was born at Greenisland, Co. Antrim, the only son of John and Frances Wilson of Daramona House, Streete, County Westmeath, Ireland and was privately educated. He became interested in astronomy and travelled to Oran in 1870 to photograph the solar eclipse. In 1871 he acquired a reflecting telescope of 12 inches (30.5 cm) aperture and set it up in a dome in the gardens of Daramona House. He used it to experiment on the photography of the moon with wet plates and also began to study solar radiation using thermopiles. In 1881, he replaced the original telescope with a Grubb reflector of 24 inches (61 cm) aperture and a new dome and mounting that had an electrically controlled clock drive. The new telescope was mounted in a two-storey tower attached to the house with an attached physical laboratory, darkroom and machine shop. Wilson's main research efforts, in partnership with P.L. Gray, was to determine the temperature of the sun using a \\"differential radio-micrometer\\" of the sort developed by C.V. Boys in 1889, which combined a bolometer and galvanometer into one instrument. The result of their measurements was an effective temperature of about 8000 ¬∞C for the sun which, after correction to deal with absorption in the earth's atmosphere, gave a value of 6590 ¬∞C, compared to the modern value of 6075 ¬∞C. Other astronomical projects included observations on the transit of Venus, determination of stellar motion, observations of sunspots and a trip to Spain to photograph a solar eclipse. He took a great many excellent photographs of celestial bodies such as nebulae. His astronomical findings were published in a series of memoirs such as Experimental Observations on the Effective Temperature of the Sun. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1875 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1896. He received an honorary doctorate (D.Sc.) from the University of Dublin in June 1901. Wilson served as High Sheriff of Westmeath for 1894. He died relatively young at Daramona at the age of 56 and was buried in the family plot in Steete churchyard. He had married in 1886 Caroline Ada, the daughter of Capt. R.C. Granville and had a son and two daughters. His son donated his telescope to London University, where it was used for research and teaching, finally becoming a feature in Liverpool museum.

Manurhin is also used the designate Manufacture de Machines du Haut-Rhin the original designer and manufacturer of said revolver but who now only manufactures military munitions. Historythe Blue Book of Gun Values by F.G. Sjestad Manurhin, officially known as Manufacture de Machines du Haut-Rhin, in Haut-Rhin, France started by manufacturing Walther PP, PPK, and PPK/S model pistols since 1952. Previously, these guns were imported into the US from 1953 by Tholson Co. and from 1956 by Interarms. In 1984, Manurhin imported their new models directly and they were marked Manurhin on the left front slide assembly. This differs from the previous Walther stamped guns. No Interarms logo appears on the right side. During 1998, Chapuis Armes purchased Manurhin, and began manufacturing new revolvers at the new Manufacture d. Armes de tir Chapuis facility located in Saint Bonnet Le Chateau, France, utilizing the original Manurhin Equipment 1972-1998, located in Mulhouse, France. At present, there is no importation of Manurhin weapons into the U.S. Models Former models * Walther P38 - The Mauser plant in Oberndorf, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany was captured in April 1945 by the French military. With the captured machines and parts of the Walther P.38 pistols manufactured at this plant kept as war reparations, the French firm Manurhin manufactured these pistols between June 1945 and 1946 in contravention of previously agreed upon Allied regulations. The French pistols had steel grips, an overall grey parkerized finish and were marked with the Mauser production stamp \\"SVW\\" and the addition of a French \\"Rounded Star\\" stamp on the right side of the slide which indicated a pressure/proof of \\"Ordinary Smokeless Proof (Powder \\"T\\") Pressure\\". A number of these P.38s were sent to Indochina and ended up in the hands of members of the French Foreign Legion who had served in the Wehrmacht during the war.

Manurhin's facilities are just across the Rhine River from Walther, and the frame and slide blanks are made on their tooling, then shipped across the river to Germany to be finished. For the West Berlin contract, 2500 P1 pistols were produced, finished and proofed in France to circumvent the treaty.

However, for several years following the war, the Allied powers forbade any manufacture of weapons in Germany. As a result, in 1952, Walther licensed production of the PP series pistols to Manurhin who manufactured the PP series until 1986. In fact, all postwar European-made PP series pistols manufactured until 1986 were manufactured by Manurhin, even though the pistol slide may bear the markings of the Walther factory in Ulm.http://www.gunsnet.net/showthread.php?446-Manurhin-Walther-Model-PP Manurhin-MR-73 .357 Magnum revolver Current models are: * Manurhin MR 73 - a very high quality double-action revolver chambered in .38 Special/.357 Magnum.

The massacre at Worms was one of a number of attacks against Jewish communities perpetrated during the First Crusade (1096‚Äì1099). Followers of Count Emicho arrived at Worms on May 18, 1096. Soon after his arrival, a rumour spread that the Jews had boiled a Christian alive, and used his corpse to contaminate water to poison the town's wells. The local populace later joined forces with Emicho and launched a savage attack on the town's Jews, who had been given sanctuary in Bishop Adalbert's palace, though others chose to remain outside its walls.

Her body was recovered in the Susquehanna River on April 20, 2011, following a series of searches and national media coverage from various outlets, including the Today Show. The investigation into her death, was ruled a homicide. About a year later, on April 25, 2012, her half-sister's ex-boyfriend, Michael Johnson, was arrested and charged with her murder. At the time, police declined to provide any details as to how the murder occurred, how they identified him as a suspect, or a motive in the case. Johnson was convicted on February 6, 2013, of second-degree murder. However, the conviction was overturned when the trial judge granted the defense's motion for a new trial. Upon commencement of the second trial, all charges against Johnson were dropped on January 20, 2015. The case has been considered unusual because Barnes had no criminal history or any family problems. Baltimore City Police considered the case the most vexing missing person case they had ever investigated. They labeled it as Baltimore's Natalee Holloway case. The victim Phylicia Simone Barnes, born on January 12, 1994, and age 16 at the time of her disappearance, was an honor student from Monroe, North Carolina. She was on track to graduate early and had plans to attend Towson University. She was visiting her relatives in Baltimore when she disappeared. Disappearance Barnes initially was believed to have disappeared while walking to the Reisterstown Road Plaza in Baltimore from a nearby apartment complex on December 28, the last day she was seen. Following her disappearance, she never used her cell phone or credit cards or updated her Facebook page. On January 3, police stated they were 'enormously concerned' about the missing girl. On January 22, America's Most Wanted aired a short feature during commercials. =Search= Three months after her disappearance came a renewed effort for prayers. A $36,000 reward was offered. Billboards were placed along major highways advertising for clues on her disappearance. On April 9, 2011, Maryland State Police conducted a massive search of Patapsco Valley State Park using more than 100 members of law enforcement and volunteers. The search did not turn up Barnes's body, but another body with no ties to Barnes was found. Police declared themselves 'back at square one' after the search did not find her. Friends and classmates of Barnes in Monroe held a carnival to raise money in her honor on April 9. Body found and homicide investigation At 7:30 am on April 20, 2011, workers spotted a body floating in the Susquehanna River near the Conowingo Dam. Another body was later found nearby. Police confirmed the next day through a tattoo and dental records that the first body was that of Barnes. The body of the other victim, an adult male, was identified and deemed not connected to the case of Barnes. Police at the time did not rule out foul play. They said the investigation into forensics and determining how Barnes died and how she got to a location 45 miles from where she disappeared could take weeks. On May 4, following an autopsy, the death was officially ruled a homicide. The cause of death was determined, but was withheld at that time for investigative purposes in fear or jeopardizing the investigation. Soon after, a security expert discussed the Barnes case. On September 6, WSOCTV obtained court documents that showed Barnes's sister was attempting to obtain a restraining order against her former boyfriend Michael Johnson just two months following the disappearance. He was reportedly the last person to see Barnes alive. Johnson's attorney stated that Johnson was not responsible for the murder, and that he had a new girlfriend and had moved on. Johnson had been questioned eight times by police. =Suspect named= On April 25, 2012, Michael Johnson, the ex- boyfriend of Barnes' half sister, was arrested after fleeing from police, in connection with the disappearance and murder. At the time, police did not release details on the connection between Johnson and Barnes; only that Johnson was the last to see Barnes alive. At a hearing on April 27 was the first time details of the murder became public. Assistant State's Attorney Lisa Goldberg testified at a hearing that Johnson asphyxiated Barnes at her sister's apartment, and then carried her body out of the apartment in a 35-gallon plastic tub. He was reportedly seen sweating and struggling to move the container. No motive for the murder was presented at the hearing. But it was reported that Johnson had just broken up with Barnes's sister. He was reported to have been using the tub that he was alleged to have carried out the body in to remove his belongings from her apartment. The tub has not been recovered. It had been reported that during the visit, Johnson had made Barnes feel uncomfortable. He had exchanged 500 phone calls and text messages with Barnes and considered her his 'little sister.'. =Homicide count= On May 8, 2012, the city of Baltimore officially added Barnes to their 2010 homicide count. This increased the year's homicide total from 196 to 197. Considered to be nothing more than an administrative move, it still did not push the total count to 200. 2010 had been the first year since the 1970s in which the city of Baltimore recorded fewer than 200 homicides. Final plans On April 28, more than 700 people gathered at the school Barnes used to attend to remember her. Her funeral, which was private, took place in Georgia on May 7, 2011. Trial On February 6, 2013, Johnson was acquitted of first-degree murder but convicted of second-degree murder. During the trial, Barnes's sister and Johnson's former girlfriend Deena testified that Johnson had allowed Phylicia to consume alcohol and then made sexual advances on her. A neighbor testified that he had seen Johnson carrying a container out of the apartment, the one Barnes was believed to have been transported in. A petty criminal testified that he had helped Johnson dispose of the body. The defense argued that no physical evidence proved that Johnson was the killer. The defense stated that the case was entirely circumstantial, and that Johnson did not have time to kill Barnes, clean the apartment of forensic evidence, and dispose of the body within the timeframe given, and altogether, he had no motive to commit the crime. Sentencing was scheduled for March 20. Johnson could have received up to 30 years in prison. Johnson's attorneys sought a new trial, alleging that the prosecution bolstered the credibility of the petty criminal who testified on their behalf. At Michael Johnson's sentencing hearing on March 20, the judge threw out the murder conviction and ordered that he receive a new trial. Johnson's new trial was originally set for February 21, 2014, but was postponed until April 28, 2014 at the request of his new attorneys. On January 20, 2015, Judge John Addison Howard dropped all charges against Michael Johnson, stating there was insufficient evidence to continue the trial. Long-term impact on society The Barnes case has resulted in increased advocacy for the missing. =One year later= On the one-year anniversary of Barnes's disappearance, a vigil was held by family and friends in her memory at the believed site of her disappearance. Her father stated he did not believe she was murdered after having gone out and that whatever took place was in the apartment. Police said they are closer to solving the case but did not want to divulge details in order to avoid jeopardizing the investigation. Barnes' half-brother Bryan joined the Baltimore Police Department in 2012, inspired by the work detectives did. =Phylicia's Law= In 2012, a bill known as Phylicia's Law passed in the Maryland General Assembly, named after Barnes. The bill, sponsored by Maryland State Delegate Jill P. Carter, leg. dist. 41., requires the state to publish a list of missing children along with statistics, and a list of volunteers who can aid law enforcement in the search for missing children. While similar laws exist in other states, this became the first such law named after a minority-race child. The bill was signed into law by Governor Martin O'Malley on May 1, 2012. =Phylicia Barnes Foundation= A foundation was started in Barnes' memory. Fundraising was done at an area Chick-Fil-A.

It is headquartered at Stuttgart Airport in Germany. History In 1949, Howard Metzenbaum and Ted Bonda founded APCOA as the Airport Parking Company of America, Inc. in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1966, the company was acquired by the ITT Corporation and was made into a division of ITT.APCOA Company History In 1970, APCOA Autoparking GmbH was founded in Stuttgart,Eurazeo buys into European car parks The Times - February 19, 2007 under the German wing of ITT, called SEL. The company then expanded across Europe, entering Vienna, capital of Austria, in 1970; Sunbury on Thames, England, in 1981; Mantua, Italy in 1985; and Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1989. By the mid-1980s, most of the European in-country subsidiaries had been divested from ITT, and slowly over the next ten years the management of APCOA Autoparking GmbH began to re- integrate the group under common ownership. The US operations of APCOA were purchased from ITT Corporation through a management buyout in 1975 and eventually merged with Standard Parking in 1998. In 1991, venture capital company CWB Capital Partners of London financed a management buyout. The company changed its name to APCOA Holding AG in 1994, and again to APCOA Parking AG in 1995. It trades on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, with 75% of shares held by UK registered investors. In April 1999, Salamander AG of Kornwestheim acquired 27.1% of APCOA Parking AG shares, and took complete control in October of that year. The company continued to expand through acquisition, including the parking subsidiary of UK based FirstGroup. In 2002 EnBW-AG of Karlsruhe purchased 98.7% of Salamander AG, to virtually control APCOA Parking AG. After consolidating various partnerships to 100% ownership, the company continued its expansion into Eastern Europe, entering Rijeka, Croatia in 2003. The company was delisted from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2003. Current operations On June 30, 2004, Investcorp acquired 98.3% of APCOA Parking AG shares from EnBW AG through its vehicle Parking Holdings GmbH for ‚Ç¨265 million including debt. In 2005 the company entered Switzerland, and changed the name of Parking Holdings GmbH to APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH (APHG). After a bidding battle with National Car Parks owned by 3i, and Australia's Macquarie Bank; on 19 February 2007 French based investment company Eurazeo announced the proposed purchase of APCOA Parking AG for ‚Ç¨885 million from Investcorp. APCOA is presently the market leading provider of car parking (by number of spaces managed) in Germany (225,000 spaces), Norway (96,900), Denmark (61,900), Austria (48,100), Italy (42,400), and Poland (12,600).Eurazeo to purchase APCOA  2012 restructuring process  APCOA tried to restructure its significant amount of debt derived from the 2007 leveraged buyout by Eurazeo from 2012 onwards. In a first step management tried to find equity investors as well as refinancing partners in order to decrease the debt pressure on the companies performance. This process was stopped a year later as the necessary partners could not be found. Already then APCOA's debt was traded actively with Centerbridge becoming the major creditor with more than 50% of debt value.http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk- apcoa-loans/centerbridge-buys-up-apcoas-debt-before-restructuring- idUKBRE9A40UI20131105 Due to the failure of the first process, management decided to restructure itself using a court supervised UK-Scheme of arrangement. With this procedure APCOA was able to overrule dissenting creditor minorities previously hindering the restructuring process. On October 30, 2014 the High Court of Justice in London sanctioned the scheme reducing the companies debt by ‚Ç¨440 million through a debt equity swap and introduced additional financing of ‚Ç¨80 million. The group is now majority-owned by US and UK-based private investment firm Centerbridge, which has taken control through the debt-equity swap.

National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Portrait of Louis Guillaume is an oil on canvas portrait by Paul C√©zanne painted c. 1882. Guillaume was the son of friends of the artist and a friend of C√©zanne's son, Paul. Here he is portrayed in a highly sculpted manner with a near-expressionless, uncommunicative face, and an immobile, lifeless body. In form and complexity, the painting is ahead of its time. It contains many abstractions, mostly in its presentation of the head and body as simple, solid shapes,Schapiro, 68 a technique later taken up and developed by Henri Matisse. The work's low-key colours, mostly greys, whites and dark greens, achieve a sombre tone, echoed by the shy reserve on the boy's face. While his skin is rendered with pearly white paint, giving the surface a lively sheen or glow, this contrasts with his black, severely cropped hair and dark clothes,Duffy, Jean H. \\"Reading between the lines: Claude Simon and the visual arts\\". Liverpool University Press, 1998. while his eyes are only black hollows. Heavy-lidded, they are, according to art critic Meyer Schapiro, \\"without spiritual light ... they belong to a world of shadow.\\" One critic famously wrote that C√©zanne painted the heads of friends as if they were apples, and that sense of cool detachment is evident in this work. Its formal qualities are reminiscent of a still-life or landscape, however while at first look there is evidence of the artist's awareness of the \\"abyss between human beings\\", there are signs of hope and connection in the delicately rendered tones of the cheeks, the ornament of the wall, the folds of the dress, and the cravat which echoes the verticals of the folds of the face and wall. The painting was purchased by Ambroise Vollard by 1906. It was sold to a Florentine collector c 1907 before it was sold in 1927 to Chester Dale in New York. In 1963 Dale donated the work to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\\"Louis Guillaume, c. 1882\\". National Gallery of Art. Retrieved 22 April 2017. References Sources * Schapiro, Meyer.

She married Robert Reid, who was a federal judge, on November 29, 1836, after meeting him during a visit to St. Augustine, Florida earlier that year. They had two sons, William and Raymond. Her husband died in 1841, and their son William died the following year. Following her husband's death, Reid worked as a schoolteacher in Jacksonville and Fernandina. Her surviving son Raymond enlisted in the 2nd Florida Infantry May 23, 1861, and Mary Martha Reid's wish to be near him made her a nurse. Together with Dr. Thomas M.

But his highest innings was just 14, made in the match against Surrey at The Oval in 1895, and he did not take a wicket in eight overs of bowling spread across three of his six games.

Built in 1935, she was a passenger ferry on the Clyde, seeing wartime service as HMS Aristocrat. From 1953, she served for 14 years on the Millport station. History Talisman was the Clyde's first motor vessel and the world's first diesel electric paddle vessel. Built by A. & J. Inglis in 1935 for the London and North Eastern Railway, she was a replacement for their 1896 . The new vessel's revolutionary engines gave considerable trouble, resulting in a sudden withdrawal at the peak of the 1939 season. After war time service, engine problems continued and, with the arrival of the diesel Maids, Talisman was withdrawn in 1953. She was reprieved and re-engined in 1954, to replace the slow on the Millport station. She continued in summer service until her withdrawal in 1966. She was sold for scrap and broken up in 1967 by W H Arnott, Young & Co at Dalmuir. Layout Talisman had a passenger capacity of over 1250. Large deckhouses fore and aft and a single tall funnel amidships gave her an unusual appearance for a Clyde Steamer. During the refit on returning to civilian service, new deckhouses were added, providing additional shelter. Her four British Polar diesel engines powered the vessel's electricity generators that provided the power to the electric propulsions motors. Decca radar was fitted in late 1958. Service Talisman was based at Craigendoran, sailing to Dunoon, Rothesay and the Kyles of Bute. She was requisitioned by the Admiralty as HMS Aristocrat, operating as an anti aircraft ship and in other roles, including as an HQ ship at the Normandy landings. After her reprieve in 1953, Talisman was successfully placed on the Wemyss Bay - Largs - Millport route. Despite the noise and vibration of her engines, she became a popular vessel and served Millport for another 14 years.

Along with Bertrand in Lisbon, it is one of the oldest bookstores in Portugal and frequently rated among the top bookstores in the world (placing third in lists by guidebook publisher Lonely Planet and The Guardian). History Livraria Lello (or Livraria Chardron), Porto The detail of the Lello bookstore pinnacles and stained-glass windows In 1869, the Livraria Internacional de Ernesto Chardron was founded, from a shop on Rua dos Cl√©rigos by the Frenchman . Following its founder's death, at the age of 45, the firm was sold to Lugan & Genelioux Sucessores. Alternately, in 1881, Jos√© Lello along with his brother-in-law created the firm David Pereira & Lello. But, the following year, after the death of David Louren√ßo Pereira, the establishment began to be operated as Jos√© Pinto de Sousa Lello & Irm√£o, when he partnered with his younger brother (Ant√≥nio Lello). The brothers were born to a property-owner in Villa Ramadas (Fontes), in the municipality of Santa Marta de Penagui√£o: both became prominent members of Porto's intellectual bourgeoisie by the turn of the century. In 1891, the Chardron Bookstore acquired the establishments of A.R. da Cruz Coutinho and other bookstores in the city. This ultimately led to Mathieux Lugan selling his share in the Chardon bookstore to the brothers Lello, in 1894. These purchases later included the 7 April 1898 sale of the firm Livraria Lemos & Co. The brothers hired engineer Francisco Xavier Esteves (1864-1944) to construct the new bookstore on Rua das Carmelitas. In 1906, the Livraria Lello was inaugurated. By 1919, the bookstore was simply designated as the Lello & Irm√£o, Lda. With the 1930 addition of Jos√© Pereira da Costa, the bookstore began to be known simply as Livraria Lello. But, between 1930 and 1940, it once again became designated Lello & Irm√£o. On 14 December 1981, there was a proposal to classify the store by the Delega√ß√£o Regional do Norte (Northern Regional Delegation) of the Secretary-of-State for Culture. It took almost a decade, before a dispatch was issued by the IPPAR presidency to open a process of classification (on 28 September 1993). The IPPAR consultative council favoured its establishment as a Im√≥vel de Interesse P√∫blico (Property of Public Interest) pm 24 March 1994. In 1995, Lello & Irm√£o created a new society: Pr√≥logo Livreiros S.A., which preceded its reopening on 15 March 1995, following a period of restoration and remodelling. The Secretary-of-State for Culture solicited a presentation on 14 March 201 to establish a special protection zone (ZEP) the site, which was supplemented by the DRCNorte (on 12 April). The proposal was seen as a positive initiative by the National Cultural Council on 31 May. The ZEP decision was published on 28 January 2013 (Announcement 35/2013, Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 2, 19). Beginning in July 2015, the bookstore began requesting entrance fees for visitors. On 21 April 2016, an artistic mural was erected to conceal the scaffolding placed on the facade of the building, during its restoration, by graffiti writer Dheo and colleague Pariz One. Dheo painted the central area of the mural with a pile of old books, a lit candle and a bottle of Port wine, while the rest was painted by Pariz One with geometric shapes, referring to the stained glass inside the bookstore. The work took two months to produce. On 31 July, following the restoration, the main facade of the building was uncovered, showing the laboratory-tested recovered primitive gray.  Architecture  The interior of the store, showing skylight, staircase and book shelves The famous staircase to the second floor shelves The bookstore is flanked by shops and fronts the Pra√ßa de Lisboa, near to the Porto University Faculty of Sciences building, the tower and Cl√©rigos Church. The rectangular plan covers two-stories, representing a simple mass, covered in tiled roof. Its principal facade is oriented to the south, towards the Ruas das Carmelitas and related to the Pra√ßa de Lisboa. The building's exterior has a mixed architectural suggesting Neo-Gothic, and Art Nouveau elements, and in the interior, implied Art Deco elements. On the first floor, it includes bated arch, divided into three vains, with the central arch providing entrance into the building and decorative lateral windows, each surmounted by flag adapted to the archway. Above this arch are three elongated rectangular windows flanked by two painted figures representing \\"Art\\" and \\"Science\\" (work of Professor Jose Bielman). Finishing the facade are squared plaits surmounted by three decorated pinnacles, with two pilasters on either side, topped by pinnacles of equal design. Decorative elements complete the facade with alternating geometric shapes that circuit and the firm's name LELLO & BROTHER over the bow, all painted in vivid colours that highlight the white paint on the facade. =Interior= The ample interior space is marked by a forked staircase connecting to a gallery on the first floor with detailed wood balusters. Over this staircase is a large stained glass window, with the central motto Decus in Labore and monogram of the owners. The ceiling and interiors are treated exhaustively with painted plaster, designed to resemble sculpted wood surfaces and decorative elements. The building still retains the rails and wooden cart once used to move books around the store between the shelves.

Fernsworth was an American author, journalist, and activist against fascism, who wrote about the Spanish Civil War in such books as Spain's Struggle for freedom, Dictators and Democrats, Andorra: Mountain Museum of Feudal Europe, Spain's Schedule of War and Next Round in Spain. He gained international attention as a foreign correspondent covering the Spanish Civil War for The Times of London and The New York Times. He authored several articles for Foreign Affairs magazine: Revolutionary Forces in Catalonia, Back of the Spanish Rebellion Mass Movements in Spain, Andorra: the Passing of Europe's Last Feudal State, and Whither Spain? He was a notable Catholic reporter of the Spanish Civil War, alongside Ernest Hemingway and Taylor of the Chicago Tribune. The American press attempted to suppress his reporting during the Spanish Civil War: \\"In January 1977, Historia revealed for the first time in Spain what Seldes, Matthews, Hemingway, Fernsworth and others attempted to report in this country [Spain], that 'Nazism and Fascism were accepted and became Franco‚Äôs policy from the first days of the war. These facts the American press also largely suppressed, preferring to call Hitler‚Äôs and Mussolini‚Äôs collaborator Franco a nationalist,' asserts [George] Seldes.\\" In the book What We Saw Spain Die, Paul Preston mentions Fernsworth. Amanda Hopkinson (Independent) reviewed Preston's book: \\"Described as a 'Conservative democrat of the old school, who had become a staunch defender of the new Republic', Fernsworth was grey-haired, wore a pince-nez and, a devout Roman Catholic, contributed to the Jesuit weekly America. Yet rather than lurid, unsubstantiated tales of torched churches and raped nuns, he wrote a careful account of the plight of fleeing refugees from Almer√≠a for The Times. Despite the provision of sworn statements, The Times refrained from publication in favour of a denial from its correspondent. No act of faith must be allowed to get in the way of the facts ‚Äì even when Fernsworth knew those facts 'would be harmful to the Republican cause for which ... I felt a deep sympathy. But it was the truth and had to be told'. Mr. Fernsworth attended Santa Clara University in 1908. He was a Neiman Fellow, Class of 1944. In a news conference on November 23, 1954, Mr. Fernsworth, reporting for The Christian Century, questioned President Eisenhower: \\"Mr. President, by request for the Christian Century: The World Council of Churches at Evanston, recently set forth certain objectives in the international order. The Christian Century asked me to call your attention to several of them briefly: I. 'That Christians can never accept as the only kind of existence open to them a state of perpetual tension leading to inevitable war. 'It is resolved: We appeal to the statesmen and the leaders of public opinion to refrain from words and actions that are designed to inflame enmity and hatred.' 2. --And I will go very briefly--'Reconciliation in a Christian spirit with potential enemy countries and a conviction that it is possible for nations and people to live together in a divided world.' The Council avoided the use of the moot term 'coexistence.' 3. 'An end to a suicidal competition in arms and to a situation which is unfit to be described as peace.' It asks--I am quoting all along, Mr. President--'Universal enforceable disarmament through the United Nations.' 4. 'Elimination and prohibition of atom and hydrogen bombs and other weapons of mass destruction, and the insistence that nations carry, on tests only within their respective territories or, if elsewhere, only by international clearance and agreement.' The Christian Century feels that the Christian world is anxious to know the President's views on these questions.' \\" In a news conference on April 25, 1956, Mr. Fernsworth, reporting for the Concord Monitor, questioned President Eisenhower to speak about \\"charges that a Columbia University professor, Jesus Galindez, was assassinated by agents of the Trujillo dictatorship.\\" President Eisenhower said: \\"...I will have to find out about that. I don't know a thing about it.\\" On October 24, 1977, Lawrence Fernsworth went for a walk in Warner, NH and did not return. He was approximately 85 years old.

The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment (139. Gebirgsj√§ger Regiment) and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division (3. Gebirgs-Division) to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day.Whitley, p. 96 When they arrived off the Ofotfjord on the morning of 9 April, the ship remained at the mouth of the fjord while the other destroyers continued into the fjord to land their troops; she was tasked to serve as a picket ship to warn of any British attempt to interfere with the landings. Z17 Diether von Roeder was relieved later in the day to land her troops, but resumed her task the following night. Lieutenant Commander (Korvettenkapit√§n) Erich Holtorf, the ship's captain, believed that his orders ended at dawn and returned to Narvik harbor.Haarr, pp. 323, 330‚Äì331, 339 Unbeknownst to the Germans, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, Hardy, Havock, Hunter, Hotspur, and Hero were not far behind him, invisible in the dark and snow. They torpedoed two German destroyers and badly damaged two others while Z17 Diether von Roeder fired all of her torpedoes blindly at the harbor entrance and attempted to engage the British ships with her guns despite the driving snow. All of the torpedoes missed, possibly because their depth controls were set too deep, and her gunfire was ineffective. Visibility cleared as the leading British ships finished their attack on the harbor and several of them engaged Z17 Diether von Roeder. She was hit by at least five shells that destroyed No. 3 gun, severed the controls to the rudder, damaged the center and aft boiler rooms, knocking out all power, and set an oil tank on fire. The British shells killed nine of the ship's crew; most of the survivors were used to help secure the town of Narvik. Z17 Diether von Roeders radios were taken ashore and used to improve communications with other German commands within Norway.Haarr, pp. 339, 341‚Äì342, 349, 354 Z9 Wolfgang Zenker. The smaller vessels are captured Norwegian patrol boats. Over the next several days, the ship's damage was evaluated and the Germans estimated that it would take at least a week to make her mobile again. In the meantime, her light weapons were off-loaded and her stern was tied to the pier in the harbor with her bow angled outwards. This meant that only her two forward guns could bear on targets. On the night of 12/13 April, Commander (Fregattenkapit√§n) Erich Bey, the senior surviving German officer, received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. The battleship and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position.Haar, pp. 357, 360 When the British destroyers and appeared at the harbor mouth, engaging , the 25 gunners left on board opened fire on whatever British ships were visible, including Warspite. One of the Z17 Diether von Roeders shells hit the battleship's bridge, but only caused minor damage. The British initially thought that they were fired upon by coastal artillery in the smoke and confusion, but a report from a Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber from Warspite revealed the German ship. The destroyer moved through the sunken freighters to investigate and opened fire at . She started making hits with her second salvo and set the German ship's stern aflame, but Z17 Diether von Roeders return fire was devastating. The British destroyer was hit at least seven times that severed the steam pipe to the forward boiler room, damaged the center boiler room, started a fire, and knocked out her steering gear, causing her to ran aground. The German shells killed 9 men and wounded 21. The destroyer and Warspite returned fire, the latter even hitting Z17 Diether von Roeder once, but the gunners had abandoned ship once their ammunition was exhausted and only the three-man demolition party was still aboard when the destroyer approached. They lit the fuses and ran ashore; the depth charges packed into her interior exploded when the British ship was less than away with a boarding party ready.Haarr, pp. 364‚Äì365 Notes References  External links * Kriegsmarine destroyers 1937 ships Ships built in Bremen (state) Type 1936 destroyers Maritime incidents in April 1940 World War II shipwrecks in the Norwegian Sea ","title":"German destroyer Z17 Diether von Roeder"},{"id":"31561072","text":"Hussein Mahmoud Ferzat (born 1957) has been a Syrian Minister of State since 2011.

At the beginning of World War II in September 1939, she was initially deployed to lay minefields off the German coast, but was soon transferred to the Skagerrak where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods. In late 1939, Z18 Hans L√ºdemann helped to laid two offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed one destroyer and twenty merchant ships. During the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, Z17 Diether von Roeder was tasked to attack Narvik and participated in both the First and Second Naval Battles of Narvik. She was damaged by British destroyers during the first battle and was one of the last surviving German destroyers during the second battle. After the British knocked out all of her guns, the ship was run ashore to allow the crew to abandon ship. They attempted to scuttle Z18 Hans L√ºdemann with explosives to prevent her capture, but something went wrong and the British were able to board her.

As soon as the German destroyer maneuvered clear of the tanker, she fired at Havock, without scoring any hits in the dark and snow. The British ship returned fire, disabling one of Z18 Hans L√ºdemanns forward guns, severing the rudder controls, and started a fire that caused one of the magazines to be flooded. At 05:15 the ship radioed to the other destroyers anchored in the Herjangsfjord and near Ballangen. Fifteen minutes later, the British decided to attack Narvik again and her crew had managed to make some repairs in the meantime. The ship fired four torpedoes at the attacking British ship, but missed with all of them, possibly because their depth controls were set too deep.

Z19 Hermann K√ºnne, leading westwards to take up her position flanking the entrance to the fjord, was the first ship to spot the approaching British ships and alerted Bey. The five operable destroyers, including Z18 Hans L√ºdemann, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships at long range from behind a smoke screen. Although no hits were scored, they did inflict splinter damage on several of the destroyers. Lack of ammunition forced the German ships to retreat to the Rombaksfjorden (the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord), east of Narvik, where they might attempt to ambush any pursuing British destroyers.Haarr, pp. 357, 360‚Äì63 Z18 Hans L√ºdemann still had some ammunition and torpedoes left and took up position at the Straumen narrows with to give the two remaining destroyers time to scuttle themselves at the head of the fjord. The pursuing British destroyers initially engaged Z18 Hans L√ºdemann, which had opened fire at a range of about to little effect. Her four remaining torpedoes were fired blindly, one of which was observed to pass under , and all missed. Shortly afterwards hit the German destroyer twice, destroying No. 4 and No. 5 guns and damaging No. 3 gun, the only ones that could bear on the British ships. Lieutenant Commander (Korvettenkapit√§n) Herbert Friedrichs, captain of the ship, decided to withdraw as she could no longer fight the British ships and beached the ship at the head of the fjord. He ordered her rigged for demolition and abandoned ship while Z2 Georg Thiele continued to fight. Several hours later, after the latter ship was destroyed, the destroyers Hero and approached and found Z18 Hans L√ºdemann still intact, the demolition charges having failed.

Completed in early 1939, the ship spent most of her time training. At the beginning of World War II in September, she was initially deployed to lay minefields off the German coast, but was soon transferred to the Skagerrak where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods. In late 1939 and early 1940, Z20 Karl Galster helped to laid three offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed one British destroyer, a fishing trawler, and twenty merchant ships. After a refit that prevented her from participating in the German invasion of Norway in April, the ship was sent to Norway for escort duties. Later that year Z20 Karl Galster was transferred to France, where she made several attacks on British shipping. The ship returned to Germany in early 1941 for a refit and was transferred to Norway in June as part of the preparations for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Z20 Karl Galster spent some time at the beginning of the campaign conducting anti-shipping patrols in Soviet waters but these were generally fruitless. She escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic later in the year until engine problems sent her back to Germany for repairs. The ship returned to Norway in mid-1942, but was badly damaged when she ran aground in July and did not return until December. Z20 Karl Galster participated in the German attack (Operation Zitronella) on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen, well north of the Arctic Circle, in September 1943. Plagued by engine problems, the ship was under repair from November to August 1944 and then spent the next six months on convoy escort duties in southern Norway when not laying minefields. Around March 1945, Z20 Karl Galster was transferred to the Baltic Sea where she helped to escort convoys of refugee ships and also rescued evacuees herself in May, around the time that Germany surrendered. When the surviving German warships were divided between the Allies after the war, the ship was eventually allocated to the Soviet Union. Z20 Karl Galster was handed over in 1946 and renamed Prochnyy. The ship was converted into a training ship in 1950 and then became an accommodation ship in 1954. She was scrapped four years later. Design and description Z20 Karl Galster had an overall length of and was long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of , and a maximum draft of . She displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by six Wagner boilers for a designed speed of .

Her crew consisted of 10 officers and 313 sailors.Gr√∂ner, p. 202 The ship carried five SK C/34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft of the superstructure. The fifth mount was positioned on top of the rear deckhouse. The guns were numbered from 1 to 5 from front to rear. Her anti- aircraft armament consisted of four SK C/30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six C/30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above-water torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines.Whitley, p. 68 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchger√§t) passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an active sonar system was installed by the end of 1939.Whitley, pp. 71‚Äì72 =Modifications= In 1942, the ship had a FuMO 24/25 radar installed above the bridge as well as two FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radars, one of which replaced the aft searchlight. A FuMB 1 Metox radar detector was also installed that year. The details of the changes made to her anti-aircraft suite are not well documented, but photographic evidence shows that a quadruple 2 cm mount had been added by early 1944. Before the end of the war, the ship had her midships 2 cm guns replaced by a pair of 3.7 cm Flak M42 gun in single mounts and that four twin 2 cm mounts had probably been added in the forward superstructure.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 35, 40, 101, 165; Whitley, pp. 26, 73 Construction and career Z20 Karl Galster was named after Kapit√§nleutnant (Lieutenant) Karl Galster who commanded the torpedo boat and was killed in action on 21 March 1916. The ship was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on 6 January 1936. She was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W922 on 14 September 1937, launched on 15 June 1938, and commissioned on 21 March 1939. She visited √Öndalsnes, Norway, in July and then participated in a torpedo training exercise the following month.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 24, 99‚Äì100; Whitley, p. 82 When World War II began in September, Z20 Karl Galster was initially deployed in the German Bight where she laid defensive minefields. The ship then patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods.Rohwer, pp. 2, 5 On the night of 17/18 October, Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) G√ºnther L√ºtjens, aboard his flagship Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, led , , , , and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid a minefield off the mouth of the River Humber. The British were unaware of the minefield's existence and lost seven ships totaling . Missions on the nights of 8/9 and 10/11 November had to be aborted because of seawater contamination in Z19 Hermann K√ºnnes fuel. On the night of 12/13 November Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, now the flagship of the F√ºhrer der Zerst√∂rer (FdZ) (Commander of Destroyers), Kapit√§n zur See (KzS) (Captain) Friedrich Bonte, escorted Z18 Hans L√ºdemann, Z19 Hermann K√ºnne, and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid 288 magnetic mines in the Thames estuary. Once again unaware of the minefield's existence, the British lost the destroyer and thirteen merchant ships of 48,728 GRT. The ship spent the rest of the year patrolling in the German Bight.Hervieux, p. 112; Koop & Schmolke, p. 100; Rohwer, p. 11; Whitley, pp. 86‚Äì92 Bonte and Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp led a minelaying sortie to the Newcastle area together with Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, Z20 Karl Galster, and on the night of 10/11 January 1940. The destroyers and were also supposed to participate, but the former had problems with her boilers that reduced her maximum speed to and she had to be escorted back to Germany by the latter ship. The minefield only claimed one fishing trawler of 251 GRT.Hervieux, p. 113; Koop & Schmolke, p. 100; Whitley, p. 92 In retaliation for the Altmark Incident where the Royal Navy seized captured British sailors from the in neutral Norwegian waters on 16 February, the Kriegsmarine organized Operation Nordmark to search for Allied merchant ships in the North Sea as far north as the Shetland Islands. Z20 Karl Galster and Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp escorted the battleships and as well as the heavy cruiser during the sortie on 18 February. Upon her return Z20 Karl Galster began a refit that lasted until 27 May.Koop & Schmolke, p. 100; Rohwer, p. 15 After the catastrophic destroyer losses in the Battles of Narvik in April, the Kriegsmarine reorganized its surviving destroyers and Z20 Karl Galster became the flagship of the FdZ. In June the ship was tasked to lead the escort force for Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Admiral Hipper during Operation Juno, a planned attack on Harstad, Norway, to relieve pressure on the German garrison at Narvik. The ships sortied on 8 June and sank the troop transport , the oil tanker and the minesweeping trawler en route, Z20 Karl Galster assisting in the rescue of Oramas survivors. The German commander, Admiral Wilhelm Marschall, then ordered Admiral Hipper and all four destroyers to Trondheim because of the heavy weather, where they arrived in the morning of 9 June. Z20 Karl Galster remained there until she had to help screen the crippled Gneisenau as she returned to Kiel on 25 July. After a brief refit, the ship helped to lay minefields in the North Sea between 14 August and 7 September.Koop & Schmolke, p. 100; Rohwer, p. 26; Whitley, pp. 105‚Äì06 Z20 Karl Galster, now the flagship of KzS Fritz Berger, commander of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla (), transferred to France on 9 September in preparation for Operation Sealion, the planned invasion of Great Britain. Now based at Brest, the ship helped to lay a minefield in Falmouth Bay during the night of 28/29 September. Five ships totaling only 2,037 GRT were sunk by this minefield.Whitley, pp. 106‚Äì107 Aboard his flagship , the F√ºhrer der Torpedoboote (Commander of Torpedo Boats), KzS Erich Bey, led Z20 Karl Galster and three other destroyers during a sortie for the Southwest Approaches on 17 October and were intercepted by a British force of two light cruisers and five destroyers. The British opened fire at extreme range and were forced to disengage in the face of long-range torpedo volleys and attacks by Luftwaffe bombers without having hit any of the German ships. On the night of 24‚Äì25 November, Z20 Karl Galster, no longer Berger's flagship, Z4 Richard Beitzen and Z10 Hans Lody sortied from Brest, bound for the Land's End area. En route they encountered some fishing ships south-west of Wolf Rock and engaged them with gunfire with little effect. The German ships then spotted a small convoy and Z20 Karl Galster sank one of the three merchantmen and damaged another. The flash from the guns alerted the five destroyers of the British 5th Destroyer Flotilla, but they could not intercept the German destroyers before dawn. Three nights later the German ships sortied again for the same area. They encountered two tugboats and a barge, but only sank one of the former and the barge, totaling 424 GRT. This time the 5th Destroyer Flotilla was able to intercept around 06:30 on 29 November. The Germans opened fire first, each destroyer firing four torpedoes, of which only two from Z10 Hans Lody hit their target, the destroyer . The torpedoes hit at each end of the ship and blew off her bow and stern, but the British were able to tow her home. Z20 Karl Galster returned home on 5 December for a turbine overhaul in Weserm√ºnde that lasted until 9 June 1941.Koop & Schmolke, p. 100; Whitley, pp. 107‚Äì114 =Arctic service= Two days later, the ship was one of the escorts for the heavy cruiser L√ºtzow from Kiel to Norway as the latter ship attempted to break through the British blockade. Several Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers spotted L√ºtzow and her escorts en route and one managed to surprise the ships and torpedo the cruiser early on the morning of 13 June, forcing her to return to Germany for repairs.Whitley, pp. 122‚Äì24 Z20 Karl Galster was then sent to Kirkenes, Norway, arriving on 11 July. Now a part of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (), she participated in a sortie on 12‚Äì13 July that sank two small Soviet ships at the cost of expending 80% of their ammunition. Another sortie on 22 July saw Z20 Karl Galster temporarily serve as the flagship for KzS Alfred Schulze- Hinrichs, commander of the 6. Zerst√∂rerflottille, when his usual flagship Z10 Hans Lody had condenser problems. The destroyers sank a small survey ship and a flying boat and they were repeatedly attacked by Soviet aircraft to no effect before their return on the 24th. When the British aircraft carriers and attacked Petsamo and Kirkenes on 29 July, the destroyers were far to the east and could not catch the British ships before they left the area. Z20 Karl Galster was now assigned to escort convoys between Troms√∂ and Kirkenes; during one of these missions, the submarine Trident sank two troop-carrying freighters, and despite the destroyers. Z20 Karl Galster rescued over 500 survivors from the two ships. When Z10 Hans Lody required a refit in late September, Schulze-Hinrichs transferred his flag to Z20 Karl Galster until she had engine problems of her own and sailed for Germany on 23 November to begin a refit that lasted until 5 May 1942.Koop & Schmolke, p. 100; Whitley, pp. 124‚Äì129 The ship, now flagship of KzS Gottfried P√∂nitz, commander of the 8. Zerst√∂rerflottile (8th Destroyer Flotilla), sailed for Trondheim on 11 June. She was one of four destroyers assigned to escort the battleship during Operation R√∂sselsprung (Knight's Move), an attack on the Russia-bound Convoy PQ 17. The ships sailed from Trondheim on 2 July for the first stage of the operation, although three of the destroyers, including Z20 Karl Galster, assigned to Tirpitzs escort ran aground in the dark and heavy fog and were forced to return to port for emergency repairs. The destroyer had damaged her port turbine and buckled the port propeller shaft. Escorted by two other destroyers, Z20 Karl Galster sailed for Kiel on 12 July, steaming only on one turbine. Permanent repairs were finished by mid-November, but the ship was working up until 8 December when she was one of the escorts for L√ºtzows voyage to Norway, although storm damage en route forced the destroyer to put into Trondheim for repairs that lasted until 9 January 1943. Boiler damage put her back into the dockyard there until 27 February.Koop & Schmolke, p. 100; Whitley, pp. 141‚Äì142 On 11 March Z20 Karl Galster screened Tirpitz en route to Bogen Bay, and continued onward to Altafjord with Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, and L√ºtzow. Several weeks later, Z20 Karl Galster, and the destroyers and , sailed for Jan Mayen island on 31 March to rendezvous with the blockade runner, . They searched for several days before increasingly heavy weather forced them to return to port with storm damage. Unbeknownst to the Germans, Regensburg had been intercepted and sunk by a British cruiser on 30 March. Z20 Karl Galster took part in the raid on the island of Spitsbergen in 6‚Äì9 September, during which she landed troops on the island. Two months later the ship sailed for Bremen to begin an overhaul.Koop & Schmolke, p. 100; Whitley, pp. 165‚Äì167 =Further service= Problems with her starboard turbine, after the overhaul was finished in April 1944, put Z20 Karl Galster back in the dockyard for further work until about August when she began escorting convoys in southern Norway and helping to lay minefields in the Skagerrak. The ship continued to perform those duties until she began a brief refit in Oslo, Norway, between 20 December and 13 January 1945. Z20 Karl Galster helped to lay a minefield in the North Sea on 8 March. Afterwards, she was transferred to the Baltic and assigned to escort and patrol duties.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 100‚Äì101; Rohwer, pp. 347, 394; Whitley, pp. 168, 170‚Äì171 In May, the ship was assigned to evacuate civilians and troops trapped in ports along the Baltic Sea by advancing Soviet forces. The survivors were transported to Copenhagen, Denmark. When the German troops in Denmark surrendered on 5 May, Z20 Karl Galster transferred survivors to smaller ships outside the harbour to avoid having to surrender. There the ship received an open radio transmission by Grand Admiral (Gro√üadmiral) Karl D√∂nitz asking \\"everybody to \\"Curry\\" who can make it until dawn on the 8th\\". D√∂nitz had chosen the word \\"Curry\\" to obscure the fact that he wanted the ships to go on a rescue mission. The German captains knew \\"Curry\\" to be the nickname of their former naval academy instructor, Admiral August Thiele, commander in Hela on the Hel Peninsula. So the ship's final mission led back to the Peninsula, which was one of the few remaining footholds on the coast under German control on 8 May. At 22:00, two hours before the surrender became effective, Z20 Karl Galster, Z14 Friedrich Ihn, the destroyer and two torpedo boats, and , picked up some 1,200 to 2,000 soldiers each.Becker, p. 360 Every German vessel located east of Bornholm at midnight was to return to a port under Soviet control, but Z20 Karl Galster, using its superior speed, managed to outrun pursuing Soviet torpedo boats and headed to Flensburg. From there the ship was sent to Kiel, where she surrendered to the British and was decommissioned on 10 May.Koop & Schmolke, p. 101; M√ºller & Kramer, p. 24 =Postwar activities= After the war Z20 Karl Galster sailed to Wilhelmshaven while the Allies decided how to divide the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves as war reparations. The ship was allotted to the Soviet Union in late 1945 and turned over to the Soviets on 6 February 1946 in LiepƒÅja, Latvia. She was renamed Prochnyy and assigned to the Red Banner Baltic Fleet on 5 November. Prochnyy was converted into a training ship in 1950 and was then reclassified as an accommodation ship, designated PKZ 99, on 28 November 1954. The ship was scrapped in 1958.Koop & Schmolke, p. 101; Whitley, pp. 191‚Äì192, 198 Notes References   External links * Kriegsmarine destroyers 1938 ships Ships built in Bremen (state) Type 1936 destroyers Destroyers of the Soviet Navy ","title":"German destroyer Z20 Karl Galster"},{"id":"31561169","title":"Lydia Wilson"},{"id":"31561177","text":"Platygillellus bussingi, Bussing's stargazer, is a species of sand stargazer native to the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and Panama where it can be found on sandy bottoms at depths of from .

Small, lightly equipped armies were maintained at all times. The near-constant state of war resulted in a need for maritime experience, ship technology, power, and organization. This led the Crowns of Aragon, Portugal, and later Castile, to put their efforts into the sea. Due to geography, Iberian countries had greater access to the sea than did much of Europe; this allowed the Iberian kingdoms to become a people of mariners and traders. These people had the motivation to move; they were close to the wealth of Africa and the Mediterranean. Expansion and development of ship technology were due to commercial, military and religious endeavors. By 1411, Portugal was no longer fighting Castile. In 1415, it conquered Ceuta, its first overseas colony.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 4 The crusades cemented trade and external alliances. Portugal wanted to protect its coast from Muslim raids and secured their base in the Mediterranean. They were able to attack Muslim commerce while taking part in the trade of gold, slaves, and ivory. As a seafaring people in the south- westernmost region of Europe, the Portuguese became natural leaders of exploration during the Middle Ages. Faced with the options of either accessing other European markets by sea, by exploiting its seafaring prowess, or by land, and facing the task of crossing Castile and Aragon territory, it is not surprising that goods were sent via the sea to England, Flanders, Italy and the Hanseatic league towns. One important reason was the need for alternatives to the expensive eastern trade routes that followed the Silk Road. Those routes were dominated first by the republics of Venice and Genoa, and then by the Ottoman Empire after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, which barred European access. For decades the ports in the Spanish Netherlands produced more revenue than the colonies, since all goods brought from Spain, Mediterranean possessions, and the colonies were sold directly there to neighbouring European countries: wheat, olive oil, wine, silver, spice, wool and silk were big businesses. The gold brought home from Guinea stimulated the commercial energy of the Portuguese, and its European neighbors, especially Spain. Apart from their religious and scientific aspects, these voyages of discovery were highly profitable. They had benefited from Guinea's connections with neighboring Iberians and north African Muslim states. Due to these connections, mathematicians and experts in naval technology appeared in Portugal. Portuguese and foreign experts made several breakthroughs in the fields of mathematics, cartography and naval technology. In 1434 the first consignment of African slaves was brought to Lisbon; slave trading was the most profitable branch of Portuguese commerce until India was reached. Throughout the fifteenth century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for several tradable commodities, as firearms, spices, silver, gold, slaves. Portugal were able to have a unique evolution of ships because they were on a geographically crucial land area, one that was literally a hinge between Northern and Southern waters. When there was no reason to expand the development of ships, their development was partially stagnant, even though they were not perfected yet. People would utilize mainly two kinds of ships: longships and roundships (dromonds). Longships were reliant on oarsmen and they tended to be used as warships. Roundships, on the other hand, used sails and tended to be used for carrying freight.John Masefield. On the Spanish Main. (London, Methuen: 1925)p. 229 These ships met the conditions of the sea but not in a perfected sense. The galley (longship) had to be light so that the men could propel it and it had to be long enough so enough men could move the ship. These specifications made it impossible for the ship to be adequately provisioned for a long voyage. As long as the longship was not venturing too far from any given port, she did her job, but clearly for the voyages that would make Spain and Portugal famous, she was simply not cut out for the work. The roundship was able to hold more provisions and she was able to resist more perilous weather than the longship but was impossibly slow, so almost useless as a ship meant to work in warring conditions.John Masefield. On the Spanish Main. (London, Methuen: 1925)p. 229 These ships were important for their intended jobs, but in no way capable of maritime exploration to distant seas. If Iberians wanted to travel further, they had to utilize different technologies to propel the advancement of ships. Iberian peninsular kingdoms were exposed to both Northern and Southern ships from surrounding states. The Mediterranean tended to rely on triangular lateen sails and the use of actual tools to correct navigation. Lateen sails were such an innovation because they had the ability to carry a ship with even the smallest of breezes.Peter Russell. Prince Henry 'the Navigator': A Life. (Yale University Press, United States: 2001)p. 227 Atlantic sailors tended to utilize a stouter, heavier Baltic cog, lapstrake, planked cargo ship with a single square sail that had axial stern rudders that was meant to help in the stormy waters they were accustomed to.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 6 Background The cultural context of the Iberian Peninsula was different from that of the rest of Continental Europe from the Middle Ages, due to contact with Moorish culture and the isolation provided by the Pyrenees. Doctrines, equipment, and tactics differed from those found in the rest of Europe. The forces were capable of quickly moving long distances, allowing a quick return home after battle. Wars were fight mainly at borders, in no man's land, where skirmishers lived, people who were used to a life of sacking enemy posts and villages. On land, these wars combined some European methods with techniques from Muslim raiders in Al- Andalus. These tactics consisted of small groups who attempted to catch their opponents by surprise, through an ambush. In Mombasa Vasco de Gama resorted to piracy, looting Arab merchant ships, which were generally unarmed trading vessels without heavy cannons. There were obstacles to work around, such as the dependence on wood for the construction of ships. Geography benefited Portugal by allowing them open access to the water and a suitable coast for ports, but they also had to deal with scarce forests from which to procure trees. In order to encourage shipbuilders, the government would give specific subsidies to certain areas. This was the case in Lisbon, where the government completely eliminated the tax on trees from the royal forest, for trees that would be made into ships that would be over one hundred tons.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 8 Fewer numbers of trees meant that the people working on the construction would not be allotted room for mistakes, so the ships being newly built were clearly being built with the newest of ship technologies which led to the development of Portuguese expansion through the water. Defense of C√°diz against the English (detail), by Francisco de Zurbar√°n. Spain had an easier time with shipbuilding because it was more forested than Portugal. This is not to say that Spain had a limitless supply of trees, but it did allow them more room for ship variation. Spain did not direct its people to fell trees because of their desire for tree conservation; this was because of the assumed necessity for firewood, and the need for trees to provide acorns and shelter for cattle.David C. Goodman. Power and Penury. (Cambridge University Press, New York: 1988)p. 90 The Spanish monarchy urged people to replace the trees that they cut down by encouraging that for every one felled, two seeds should be planted. What unfortunately tended to occur was the simple transplanting of trees to areas with recently cut down forests. This often resulted in trees that died because they were not able to properly adjust to the new environment.David Goodman. Spanish Naval Power, 1589‚Äì1665. (Cambridge University Press: Great Britain: 1997)p. 110 It was not until the 1560s and 1570s that Philip II began to show actual interest in the timber for shipbuilding and began allocating definite numbers of oaks trees that needed to be set in certain districts. There were definite laws that were being enforced with special forest guards that reported directly to the king; this even resulted in some corporations pleading poverty.David C. Goodman. Power and Penury. (Cambridge University Press, New York: 1988)p. 90 The Spanish were excellent shipbuilders; later on in the century, ships themselves were used as items of commerce. The English alone have records of buying six galleons from the Spanish in order to build up their own fleet. Even with a dwindling supply of trees, the profitable avenue of shipbuilding encouraged construction. Shipbuilding became integrated into the Spanish economy; areas specialized. Seville, for example, was known for the repairing of ships, the manufacture of sails and the making of biscuits and casks for shipyard provisions.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 10 These commercial interests financed the continual development of ships. As long as there was a need for better, faster, stronger ships, people were able to improve technologies, therefore making it more probable for ships to be able to venture further from the shore and eventually across an entire ocean. Long before Castile, Portugal had colonized the Atlantic islands, Madeira, the Azores, Cape Verde, Sao Tome... it had established a marine route circling Africa, with numerous coastal enclaves along the route. Iberian mare clausum claims during the Age of Discovery. With the colonization of the Atlantic islands and the African enclaves, Portugal had enough forests to build its fleet and income to finance the construction. For example, Madeira island, literally Wood island, was uninhabited and covered with hardwood virgin forest when it was discovered and colonised. Besides coastal exploration, Portuguese ships also made trips further out to gather meteorological and oceanographic information. These voyages revealed the archipelagoes of Bissagos Islands where the Portuguese were defeated by native people in 1535,Edward Stallibrass, 'The Bijouga or Bissagos Islands, West Africa', in Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography, Vol. 11, No. 10 (Oct., 1889), p. 595. Trindade and Martim Vaz, Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, Fernando de Noronha, Corisco, Elobey Grande, Elobey Chico Annobon Island, Ascension Island, Bioko Island, Falkland Islands, Principe Island, Saint Helena Island, Tristan da Cunha Island and Sargasso Sea. The knowledge of wind patterns and currents, the trade winds and the oceanic gyres in the Atlantic, and the determination of latitude led to the discovery of the best ocean route back from Africa: crossing the Central Atlantic to the Azores, using the winds and currents that spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere because of atmospheric circulation and the effect of Coriolis, facilitating the way to Lisbon and thus enabling the Portuguese to venture farther from shore, a maneuver that became known as the \\"volta do mar\\" (). In 1565, the application of this principle in the Pacific Ocean led the Spanish making the Manila Galleon trade route. There were other factors that counteracted Iberian domination. Whether traveling up the rivers in Africa or encountering the indigenous populations in the New World, both these groups had easily maneuverable canoes that could put lots of pressure on the Portuguese and Spanish. Natives could sail up close to caravels and heavily attack them with projectiles, and then escape before Iberian ships could position themselves in an ideal fighting distance.Peter Russel.

Tordesillas line depicted, Biblioteca Estense, Modena La Ni√±a, La Pinta and La Santa Mar√≠a at Palos de la Frontera, Spain The ship that truly launched the first phase of the discoveries along the African coast was the Portuguese caravel. Iberians quickly adopted it for their merchant navy. It was a development based on North African fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and 1 to 3 masts, with lateen triangular sails allowing luffing. The caravel particularly benefited from a greater capacity to tack. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but this did not hinder their success. Limited crew and cargo space was acceptable, initially, because as exploratory ships, their \\"cargo\\" was what was in the explorer's discoveries about a new territory, which only took up the space of one person.Roger Smith, \\"Vanguard of the Empire\\", Oxford University Press, 1993, p.30 Among the famous caravels are Berrio and Caravela Annunciation. Columbus also used them in his travels. Long oceanic voyages led to larger ships. \\"Nau\\" was the Portuguese archaic synonym for any large ship, primarily merchant ships. Due to the piracy that plagued the coasts, they began to be used in the navy and were provided with cannon ports, which led to the classification of a nau according to the power of its artillery. The carrack or nau was a three- or four-masted ship. It had a high rounded stern with large aftcastle, forecastle and bowsprit at the stem. It was first used by the Portuguese, and later by the Spanish. They were also adapted to the increasing maritime trade. They grew from 200 tons capacity in the fifteenth century to 500. In the sixteenth century they usually had two decks, stern castles fore and aft, two to four masts with overlapping sails. Voyages to India in the sixteenth century used carracks, large merchant ships with a high edge and three masts with square sails, that reached 2,000 tons. People interested included merchants looking for profitable trade, people who were not initially dreaming of traveling over the vast expanses of the ocean. Merchants were agents of change. They desired stronger vessels that were most efficient with the most cargo possible. Traders desired large ships because they were harder to attack and they could carry bulk commodities cheaply. The problem with these huge vessels: they had a long turnaround rate, which was less profitable and when smaller ships started arming themselves with artillery, large ships became vulnerable.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 11 Also these ships often cost the modern equivalent of US$2 million to build. What is important to note is that need facilitated change. By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, merchants began to start favoring smaller ships. They went from heavy to a lighter sailing craft. This was around the same time that people began realizing their potential to explore further off the coasts. Ship change depends on the purpose; technologies do not invent themselves without a demand. What may have begun as commercial enterprises eventually shifted to voyages of discovery. Distant trade wants meant that development of better ships was expected. Stable ships that could be controlled by a limited number of sailors, small enough to be easily maneuverable along the coast and in rivers, yet big enough to carry provisions and trade goods across long distances, were needed. New ship developments were needed for merchants and as ships improved people realized they had potential to explore. And once people knew they had a desire to explore, ships changed their function as well. Ships for exploration had one main job: to carry an explorer's feedback, they did not have to carry a merchant's goods or a warrior's guns.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 30 This realization was huge because it meant that ship engineers now had a specific purpose for their newest construction projects. They started adapting the Mediterranean roundship that relied on a single, square rig on the mainmast and they slowly began increasing the cargo tonnage. By the fifteenth century one can easily see the transformation as ships went from single to multi- rigged and they started having a heavier reliance on artillery.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 32 This is evidence for a nice hybrid between commercial and military ships. Technologies were being communicated more readily and this led to regional differences in ships slowly becoming less distinct. When looking in a textbook one may see an array of multiple names for ships in this century, but in reality many of these ships were fundamentally the same. With a common purpose fitted to ships, which was the exploration of new territories and the expansion of the crown, ships were more uniformly designed and common patterns emerged. By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the main ships in use were the caravels and naus (carrack). Caravels are unique because they are an ‚Äòevolved‚Äô ship. They started as a small, open boat that was used by coastal merchants and fisherman. Once the boat started to be used for more than trade and fishing, it was realized that it needed to be built for the sea rather than cargo. The nau was built with more beams. It was larger and considered a ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù that was able to carry colonists, arms, tools and provisions. The nau was a clear contrast with the caravel mainly due to its higher state of utility, minus the speed of the caravel.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 34 These ships are what propelled Spain and Portugal to split the world between themselves. This high development of technology that drew upon past innovations allowed for the further expansion and exploration of uncharted waters without any inhibitions. Caravels and their purposeful evolution A lateen-rigged caravel, Caravela LatinaA replica of the caravel Boa Esperan√ßa in the city of Lagos, Portugal Portuguese trade routes (blue) and the rival Manila-Acapulco galleons trade routes (white) established in 1568 The origin of their name holds some controversy, though it is strongly supported that caravel comes from the Greek word ŒöŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒøœÇ, meaning light vessel.\\"The vessel so named which had a real celebrity in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the vessel employed by the Portuguese in their voyages of discovery and by Christopher Columbus in his daring adventure to the westward, was a small structure belonging to the family of roundships but more graceful in shape than its contemporaries, the nefs, and having narrower quarters. It was a faster sailer, more able, and was better fitted for all enterprises demanding speed and rapid maneuvering.\\" Henry B. Culver. The Book of Old Ships: And Something of Their Evolution and Romance. (Garden City Publishing Company Inc: 1924)p. 91 It had square sterns, fore and after castles and fairly high bulwarks, a bowsprit and usually four masts. It is hard to specifically look at the rig because depending on the period and the nationality, the rig was subject to change. The early caravels did not have square sails, though later, square sails were carried on the foremast for running or for bad weather. The most identifiable rig was a four mast vessel with a square-rigged foremast raking far forward and having a round top and three lateen-rigged masts gradually decreasing in size.Henry B. Culver. The Book of Old Ships: And Something of Their Evolution and Romance. (Garden City Publishing Company Inc: 1924)p. 92 Looking at exceptions may show that mainmasts occasionally carried a roundtop similar to what was on a foremast. Another type of caravel was with four masts but lateen and square sails were arranged so that the first and fourth masts were lateen sails while the second and third masts were square sails. These varieties of ships changed based on exploration while most of them were around an eighty-ton range. Caravels were designed specifically to outmaneuver previous ships. They were meant for nimble and shallow trips. Initially they went quite short in distance and duration. As voyages got longer, caravels began relying on larger storing ships that would be able to join them. They needed a ship that would be a huge storehouse of supplies as well as be able to have the consolidated power of a caravel, hence the invention of naus. Caravels and naus created an unmatchable team for explorers. Columbus used one nau, La Santa Mar√≠a, and two caravels, La Pinta and La Ni√±a, on his journey across the Atlantic. It was so successful because it had defensive armaments and the team was highly maneuverable; they were similar to floating batteries of firepower.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 36 Vasco da Gama saw the success of Columbus and in 1497 he followed Dias's lead to India using two newly constructed naus, each weighing in at one hundred tons, and one caravel, weighing in at fifty tons. By 1502 he went on another journey using ten naus and five armed caravels to go to the East African coast.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 36 These newly designed ships easily tore apart Islamic dhows. Following this pattern, Magellan had a fleet of five naus, though only one made it back on the return journey. It is helpful to look at caravels in three phases of maritime vessels: early caravels, exploring caravels and fleet caravels. Before the Spanish and Portuguese began their discoveries, caravels were small and unable to leave the sight of shore. Some of them did not even have decks. The next phase was the exploratory caravels. As Iberians began questing for more than what was immediately tradable off their own shores, they began experimenting more with ships so that gold, slaves, ivory and spices could be part of the Iberian world. Before the caravel was perfected, Iberians were relying on multiple ships: the barcha and barineles. These were in common use by the 15th century and were drawn upon to round Bojador, which took twelve years and fifteen voyages to complete. Both of these ships were utilized to continue further down the African coast. The barcha weighed in at around twenty-five to thirty tons; it was partially decked and was considered a sailing vessel although it could be rowed with the fourteen to fifteen men that usually could fill the capacity of the ship. The barinel was similar, though slightly larger.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 37 These ships were influential in their time, but the problem was that they tended to be slow and unmanageable for exploration. When these ships would make their way but up the coast when returning from Africa, it was difficult for them to fight the northeast winds. Even the addition of square sails and oars was found to be too slow. Technology changes when people demand it to; there was a need for larger crews, provisions and trading truck, not to mention a desire for more maneuverability. When people began to realize that they had specific needs that barchas and barineles were not fulfilling, that is when they started drawing on aspects of the caravel. It was realized that the caravel's shallow draft was good for riverine commerce and that is when they started understanding that the caravel, if adapted properly, would be beneficial for deeper exploration. A windward vessel was a must, so triangular sails that would allow better access to the wind were drawn upon for the revamping of the explorative ship. Part of how the Portuguese were able to build better ships was by creating hybrids of what they had seen. The caravela Latina combined their Arab conquests with what Iberians had seen in Egypt to make a ship that was longer, larger, lighter and more sophisticated than what had ever been used before. A typical caravel was fifty plus tons, twenty to thirty meters in length and six to eight meters in breadth, the lateen sails were rigged on two-thirds tall masts and occasionally no bowsprit. These adjustments made it possible to increase the speed and the crew, but at the expense of cargo space and war capabilities.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 38 People learned that what may have been of benefit going up the coast of Africa was not useful for Atlantic voyages. There was a demand for better technology so the caravela redonda was engineered. It consisted of adding three masts so there would be an increased steering ability, a new rig for ocean sailing and square sails.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 42 These improvements made it possible to sail the entire Atlantic without as much uncertainty. These initial exploratory vessels were not the end of the caravel's evolution. The caravela redonda continued to increase in size, as well as having a rigging system that became even more complex. The caravel now had three or four masts, bowsprit and topsails, and now included a crow's nest. These transformations were another phase of the caravels, and by this time they were considered caravelas de armada. This means that they were owned by the state or employed by military commanders. A variation was the caravela de mexerguerira; it was a messenger ship that was meant to transmit orders within the fleet.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 42 There was a continual change in ships because they all held different purposes. Caravels are almost universally known for their lateen sails, yet with the caravela en la modal Andalucia, the lateen sails were abandoned and its forecastle produced a higher bow.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 43 These ships allowed for a different type of movement that was better adjusted for the Atlantic Ocean. Spain was such a formidable power on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean because it knew how to adapt its ships to fit the purpose and environment they were sailing in, whether it was galleys for war or a different craft for exploration.David C. Goodman. Spanish Naval Power, 1589‚Äì1665. (Cambridge University Press, New York: 1997)p. 2 By the end of the seventeenth century, caravels were no longer being used as a main ship for exploration. They were ships that remained for the fishermen of Galicia, while new ships like the pataches began to replace them because they were fast, small, and easy for reconnaissance.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 45 Naus Victoria of Magellan. As glorious as the caravel may have been, its light nature meant that it was susceptible to volatile ocean conditions. As journeys became longer, explorers made greater demands of the ships, so the caravel got a new partner: the nau. This vessel was designed to carry larger amounts of weaponry and cargo while still maintaining reasonable speed and durability. The hull and rig were more sophisticated than previous ships and this allowed for there to be more ease on the ocean. This form was not alien from the caravel, it was an improved version. It was able to sit high in the water; this was a hybrid idea from earlier roundships, which allowed the entire vessel to be roomier. These ships had forward masts and topsails with a crow's nest, while still mixing in lateen mizzens and square mainsails.Roger C. Smith. Vanguard of the Empire: Ships of Exploration in the Age of Columbus. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1993)p. 47 There was a demand for a more seaworthy ship that still had the perks of the caravel, so the nau was engineered. In English literature naus are often mistaken for carracks, a common military ship in Britain during the early fifteenth century. Carracks were smaller ships, neither suitable for high seas nor suitable for freight. Galleons The seas carried more than explorers. Commercial trade propelled new technologies to improve ships, but another factor was for military reasons. Military conquest was a motivation; the scale of war increased to an unprecedented amount in the sixteenth century.David C. Goodman. Power and Penury. (Cambridge University Press, New York: 1988)p. 89 Countries needed to prove their military might to show that they could maintain their sovereignty. Military means was also for expansion and coercion. One of the best vessels for that was the galleon, which was primarily used as a war vessel. It was built in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In addition to their use as warships, galleons were also used for transporting treasure and cargo from the Americas.Galleon. (Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition: 2010)p. 1 A Spanish galleon. It is important to notice the differences that began to develop with the galleon versus other ships of the time, such as the capital ship, because it was made to act more efficiently in a time of war, such as having fewer decks which helped make them more graceful in the water, not to mention easier to handle for sailors. This does not mean it was the perfect design; it was large and cumbersome, and as learned in 1588, these ships were easily outmaneuvered by the English navy's lighter and swifter ships.Galleon. (Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition: 2010)p. 1 Galleons had three divisions (levels) whereas great ships had four.Henry B. Culver. The Book of Old Ships: And Something of Their Evolution and Romance. (Garden City Publishing Company, Inc: 1924). Pg 95. Another difference is the form of the head; the galleon was not long and projecting forecastle like many of the larger ships that sailed during this time. Instead the galleon's forecastle ended at her stern. It had an elongated and slimmer beck, which was comparable to a galley, which means that it projected forward.Henry B. Culver. The Book of Old Ships: And Something of Their Evolution and Romance. (Garden City Publishing Company, Inc: 1924). Pg 95. The transom of the stern was square and the poop deck narrow. One can specifically look at the region of Spain and Portugal with more variations, such as the skids were meant to strengthen the sides. The fore and mainmasts were made with round tops and were capable of carrying courses and topsails in addition to having one or two lateen mizzens.Henry B. Culver. The Book of Old Ships: And Something of Their Evolution and Romance. (Garden City Publishing Company, Inc: 1924). Pg 95. In short, ‚Äúthe galleon was three-masted and square rigged, usually with two decks, and with its main batteries in broadsides.‚Äù Galleon. (Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition: 2010)p. 1 These ships were unique at the time because they were made with the specific purpose of going to war, and, because that was their job, they were made to be most efficient on the sea while catering to the needs of soldiers and sailors. After the failure of the Spanish Armada, the galleon lost much prestige; by the seventeenth century new ships were already being designed that would better fit the needs of the Iberian empires. New demands led to new ship technologies. Developments of shipbuilding were adjusted to fit the time and the motivations of the state, though a definite decline in shipbuilding occurred as the Iberian empires adjusted to more internal conflicts.

It is endemic to Idaho in the United States, where it is mostly limited to a specific habitat type in the southwestern part of the state. It was federally listed as a threatened species in 2009.USFWS. Listing Lepidium papilliferum (Slickspot Peppergrass) as a shreatened species throughout its range; Final rule. Federal Register October 8, 2009. This is an herb growing just a few centimeters to over 20 centimeters tall, and known to approach 40 centimeters. The leaves are divided into many subdivided lobes, the largest blades measuring 4 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a raceme of many white flowers. The fruit is a rounded, flattened, winged silique up to 3 or 4 millimeters long by 3 to 4 wide.Lepidium papilliferum. Flora of North America. There is an annual form and a biennial form of the plant, the annual form completing its life cycle in one year and the biennial not producing flowers or seed until its second year. This plant grows in the sagebrush steppe ecosystem, where it can be found in microsites called slick spots, patches of soil covered in a cryptogamic crust of cyanobacteria and algae. Occurrences outside of slick spots are rare. Slick spot soil is generally relatively high in sodium and clay, and the spots are mostly bare of vegetation and very slightly indented so that water accumulates. The soil is lighter in color than surrounding soils. In the dry season the water evaporates and the area becomes very dry. Slick spots take a long time to form; those existing now were likely formed during the Pleistocene, and then altered early in the Holocene when salt deposits were layered over them by wind. It is thought that slick spots are no longer being formed in today's climate, so when they are destroyed they are permanently lost. The slickspot peppergrass population in the slick spots varies with annual moisture levels; more spring precipitation allows the growth of more plants.Lepidium papilliferum. The Nature Conservancy. In general, the population is thought to have declined over time. Slick spot habitat in its limited area has been degraded by agriculture, grazing of cattle, urban development, and wildfire. The frequency of wildfire is increasing as the habitat is invaded by introduced plants such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). References External links *Menke, C. A. and T. N. Kaye. (2006).

It was established in 1952 at Hamilton AFB, California in a general reorganization of Air Defense Command (ADC), which replaced wings responsible for a base with wings responsible for a geographical area. It moved twice in the first few months it was active and as a result became non operational until early 1953. It then assumed control of several Fighter Interceptor and Radar squadrons in the Pacific Northwest, some of which were Air National Guard squadrons mobilized for the Korean War. It was discontinued in the fall of 1954 and its units transferred to the new 9th Air Division. History 84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Northrop F-89C Scorpion at Hamilton Air Force Base, California, 1952. The 4702nd Def Wg was organized on 1 February 1952 at Hamilton Air Force Base (AFB) as part of a major reorganization of Air Defense Command (ADC), due to the difficulty it experienced under the existing wing-base organizational structure in deploying fighter squadrons to the best advantage.Grant, C.L., The Development of Continental Air Defense to 1 September 1954, (1961), USAF Historical Study No. 126, p. 33 The wing assumed operational control and the air defense mission of the 83d and 84th Fighter Iinterceptor Squadrons (FIS),Maurer, p. 293 two fighter squadrons formerly assigned to the inactivating 78th Fighter-Interceptor Wing (FIW), both of which were flying Northrop F-89 Scorpion aircraft.Cornett & Johnson pp. 119-120 The support elements of the 78th FIW were replaced at Hamilton by the wing's 566th Air Base Group (ABG) the same day.Cornett & Johnson, p. 85 The wing's mission was to train and maintain tactical units in a state of readiness to intercept enemy aircraft attempting to penetrate the air defense system.Abstract, History of 4702nd Def Wg, Jan-Mar 1952 (accessed 15 Feb 2012) However, the wing was initially unable to perform its mission satisfactorily due to problems with its F-89s.Abstract, History of 4702nd Def Wg, Apr-Jun 1952 (accessed 15 Feb 2012) In July 1952, the 83d FIS moved from Hamilton AFB to Paine AFB, WA and was reassigned from the wing a few days later. In November 1952, the wing moved to Geiger Field, Washington and the wing's units at Hamilton, the 566th ABG and the 84th FIS, were reassigned to the 28th Air Division. As a result of this move, the wing temporarily lost all of its operational units, but it assumed USAF host responsibility for Geiger Field through its newly assigned 87th Air Base Squadron, already stationed there.Abstract, History of 4702nd Def Wg, Jan-Jun 1953 (accessed 15 Feb 2012) In January 1953, the wing once again assumed an operational mission, when the 323d FIS at Larson AFB, Washington flying radar equipped and rocket armed F-86 Sabre interceptor aircraftCornett & Johnson, p. 392 was assigned to the wing.Maurer, p. 398 Two other fighter-interceptor squadrons at Larson, the 31st,Maurer, p. 53 also flying Sabres and the 82d,Maurer, p. 287 flying F-94 Starfires were added later in the year, although the 82d FIS soon deployed overseas. Oddly, no fighter squadron at Geiger was ever assigned directly to the wing while wing headquarters was there. In another major ADC reorganization the following month, the wing assumed responsibility for the aircraft detection, warning and control mission with the assignment of the dispersed 636th-638th and 760th Aircraft Warning & Control (AC&W;) Squadrons.Cornett & Johnson, p. 99Cornett & Johnson, p. 155 and as ADC reorganized its fighter units, the 530th Air Defense Group, with two additional F-86 squadrons activated and also assumed host responsibilities for Geiger Field.Cornett & Johnson, p. 83 The wing also added the 680th AC&W; Sq, as well as five nationalized Air National Guard (ANG) AC&W; Squadrons at Geiger Field.Cornett & Johnson, pp. 94-96 Later in 1953, the ANG squadrons were returned to ANG control and four of them were replaced by the regular USAF 682nd-685th AC&W; Squadrons.

Without a US visa to extend her stay, she left to practise in Saudi Arabia for a year. She wrote down her daily experiences as a woman practising medicine and published them in a book. In June 2013, Ahmed visited Israel, speaking at universities and research institutes around the country. Medical career Ahmed practised medicine in the National Guard Health Affairs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Literary and journalism career Ahmed is the author of In the Land of Invisible Women, an account of her experiences as a physician in Saudi Arabia. Views on Islam and Islamism Ahmed claims to be a practicing Muslim while she is a continual critic of Islam. She has been described by the media as a Muslim reformist. She has argued \\"Islamists exploit democratic institutions to further their sectarian aims\\" and that \\"Exposing Islamists as dangerous totalitarians is not an act of anti-Muslim bigotry but an essential defense of both liberal democracy and Islam.\\" Ahmed has cited the regime of Mohamed Morsi in Egypt as an example of the consequence of Islamists rising to power. Ahmed has called on the US State Department to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. She stated \\"By encouraging separatism and indoctrinating its members with the totalitarian tenets of 20th-century Islamism, the Muslim Brotherhood seeks to disrupt the fabric of democracy.\\" In 2018, she defended Boris Johnson over his comments regarding the burqa and niqƒÅb.

It premiered November 14, 2002 under the direction and dedicated to Robert Spano. City Scape calls for a concerto grosso, in which 35 instruments are used; yet many of these instruments have featured solos that are scattered throughout the piece. The piece lasts a total of 31 minutes. City Scape is a piece in three movements that paints an image of where Higdon grew up in Atlanta, Georgia: \\"Skyline\\", \\"River Sings a Song to Trees\\", and \\"Peachtree Street\\". The movements can be played either separately or together at the discretion of the conductor. Higdon wanted to invoke certain images and aspects of Atlanta. When asked by a musician if she was trying to express a sidewalk in her music, she commented that there was not a precise image in her piece. Instead, there were \\"bustle of traffic and intensity of moving down the street\\". Thus she wanted to give an overall image as opposed to Strauss who wanted to depict a single detailed object. In the first movement entitled \\"Skyline\\", Higdon wanted to express the city's profile through the steel buildings and monuments that represent Atlanta's signature skyline. The steel buildings represent a sense of boldness, strength, and growth along with people who live and work there. Therefore, within the first few measures of the piece, the boldness is most noticeable during the synchronized brass introduction along with percussions that accent this moment. However, near the middle of the movement, the piece has a lighter texture as noted with the wind players. This lighter texture represents the swirling of people who are moving in and out of the building. This movement is reminiscent of the styles from Aaron Copland, William Schuman and Samuel Barber in terms of urban soundscape. Her inspiration for this piece as she recalls were \\"coming out intact and so fast, [she] put it down in short score and orchestrated it later\\". Ironically, although she is considered a neo-romantic composer, her choice to write about the skyscraper is an interesting choice since most neo-romanticist usually oppose the civilized scenery and prefer to express something that is more nature-oriented. The second movement, \\"River Sings a Song to Trees\\", is the most tranquil compared of the three movements. This movement was in reference to the more nature-like part of the city such as the creeks and parks, which is in huge contrast to the skyscrapers in the last movement. More specifically the piece was inspired by the creak that ran through Higdon's yard on Ferncliff Road in Buckhead. She describes Atlanta as this \\"giant green carpet with buildings poking out\\" as seen from an airplane. Finally the last movement, \\"Peachtree Street\\", despite the serene title, is a representation of the roadways into and out of the cities. Since each street is bustling with energy and people, she wanted to reflect people moving about quickly with their business. Therefore, the theme from the first movement returns in this movement; yet at the same time, the presence of new parts illustrates the diversity as well in these original city streets. This large finale brings the piece to a close as she ties the orchestral tones into one larger voice at the end. Her piece received positive criticism from local and national newspaper alike: \\"'SkyLine' is a lively, inventive concert opener by Jennifer Higdon... she really knows how to write idiomatically for a large orchestra-to make the instruments really sound. 'SkyLine' has a strong rhythmic propulsion, witty orchestral effects, and a refreshing sense of vigor and optimism. Spano gave a dynamic, beautifully detailed reading to this masterful vignette\\" as stated by The Coral Gables Gazette. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution characterized the piece as \\"jaunty, propulsive optimism\\" and that the movement \\"ends with cresting excitement\\".

DC Comics Alternate versions of Black Bison Black Bison appears in Injustice: Gods Among Uss prequel comic series. Black Bison in other media A female version of Black Bison named Mina Chaytan appears in The Flash, portrayed by Chelsea Kurtz. Introduced in the episode, \\"When Harry Met Harry...\\", she acquired her powers after being exposed to dark matter following the Flash escaping the Speed Force as part of the Thinker's plans. Using her powers, she targets collectors of Native American artifacts before she was defeated by Team Flash and remanded to Iron Heights Penitentiary. In the episode \\"True Colors\\", she and her fellow metahuman inmates attempt to escape after learning the warden planned to sell them to the crime boss Blacksmith, but the Thinker intercepted them and stole their powers. =Blackout= Blackout (Farooq) is a metahuman who can harness electricity. He makes his first appearance in Flashpoint (vol. 2) #1 (July 2011). In the alternate timeline created by the events of Flashpoint, Blackout is recruited by Cyborg into a team of superheroes whose mission was to end the Amazon- Atlantean war, which had devastated Europe and caused millions of human casualties. To that end, the team was assigned to take down both Emperor Aquaman and Wonder Woman. Another new recruit, the Outsider, revealed during a meeting with Batman that he had been hunting Blackout so he could use his abilities to power India. This manhunt resulted in the loss of Blackout's girlfriend and his departure from school. Blackout has since voiced his reluctance to be part of the same team with his worst enemy. Blackout in other media Farooq Gibran/Blackout appears in The Flash, portrayed by actor Michael Reventar. One time Farooq Gibran was out with friends when the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator exploded and electrocuted him. He survives and later finds out he has the ability to siphon electrical energy. In the episode \\"Power Outage\\", he decides to take out revenge on Harrison Wells for the particle accelerator's activation. He is confronted by the Flash and drains the speedster's speed. He later attacks S.T.A.R. Labs, kills Girder and attacks Wells. However, the Flash was able to get the speed back and kill him. Blackout was mentioned by Barry Allen in the Supergirl episode \\"Worlds Finest\\". =Blackrock= Blackrock is a fictional supervillain in the DC Comics universe. Blackrock is a recurring enemy of Superman first appearing in Action Comics #458 (April 1976). Blackrock was the creation of Dr. Peter Silverstone in an attempt to increase ratings for the United Broadcasting television network. Silverstone hypnotized UB President Sam Tanner and later Tanner's nephew, Les Vegas, to fill the role. A third Blackrock (an energy construct) was created by Tanner's command not much later. However, it is known that eventually Silverstone assumed the mantle of Blackrock himself, using a powerful stone that could metabolize electromagnetic energy into energy to achieve flight, energy blasts and superhuman strength, and fought Superman several times. This rock, while a technological artifact, has the appearance of a polished gem that is as black as coal. It was appropriately dubbed the Blackrock. The Post-Crisis version was stated (in Batman/Superman adventures) to be a symbiotic alien life form, rather than a creation of Dr. Silverstone. Its appearance and abilities are approximately the same. Silverstone is the only Pre-Crisis user of the stone that has been mentioned in Post-Crisis continuity. Overuse of the Blackrock's powers blinded Silverstone and left him insane. He was found sitting muttering to himself and watching constant television shows in an apartment owned by an ex-convict named Samuel Benjamin, who beat Silverstone to death with the Blackrock and took it for himself. Despite its power, his inexperience with the Blackrock led to his defeat and Superman took the stone and threw it towards the Sun.Superman #218 (August 2005) A short time later, Alexander Luthor Jr., disguised as Lex Luthor, dispatched Bizarro to retrieve the Blackrock from the SunSuperman #222 (December 2005) before passing it on to a South American woman named Lucia,Superman #223 (January 2006) a drug smuggler and revolutionary who had been jailed by Superman before. Her intense feelings of hatred towards the Man of Steel matched those of the Blackrock and she proved particularly adept in using it. However, her skills were not enough to defeat Superman and the Blackrock withdrew into itself.Superman #224 (February 2006) It was eventually shown that the Blackrock had been kept by Superman, who eventually locked it away in his Fortress of Solitude. The Blackrock eventually escaped and bonded with Plastic Man. Shortly after, the Blackrock was removed from Plastic Man and found its way into the hands of Batman, who shortly afterwards decided he needed its powers to help him stop a currently- rampaging Superman (Superman had fallen under the influence of Despero as he attempted to turn Earth's alien superheroes against humans). Although it remained on Batman after Superman threw off Despero's influence, Superman was able to force it to leave Batman by threatening to kill him, informing the Blackrock that he knew Batman would rather die than live like this. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Blackrock is Bradley Glenn, an ex-con who was hired to star in a reality television show called Badass Nation about the life of a supervillain.Superman: Lois and Clark #5 (April 2016) The TV company provided him with powered armor and a fictional backstory about finding it in a crashed spacecraft. They intended to film him tearing up a bridge that was scheduled for demolition, but the crew neglected to ensure that the bridge had been closed to traffic and the Pre-Flashpoint Superman had to intervene.Superman: Lois and Clark #6 (May 2016) The Post-Crisis wielders of the Blackrock seem to have developed differing powers based on their personalities. All seem to have possessed superhuman strength and endurance, flight and energy projection abilities. The Blackrock also has the ability to absorb ambient energy to empower its wielder. Dr. Silverstone seemed most adept at using its ability to process information from TV and radio signals. Samuel Benjamin was particularly skilled at using it to boost his own physical strength and toughness. Lucia's abilities seemed to be an amalgamation of her predecessors', but she seemed to prefer using its energy projection abilities and discovered a way to use it to drain Superman's power. While the stone had bonded to Plastic Man, he was not shown using its abilities much. Batman used it in much the same way that Lucia did; however, Batman showed more of a preference for physical combat than Lucia did. Jimmy Olsen and several other humans were bonded to the Blackrocks when a shower of them rained down on Earth. These people showed some level of superhuman abilities similar to those demonstrated by Lucia, etc. but it was not shown if they were as strong as he was. Bradley Glenn's armor enabled him to leap great distances and an energy field around one gauntlet gave him a powerful punch. =Blackwing= Blackwing (Charles \\"Charlie\\" Bullock) is a fictional superhero from DC Comics. He was created by Paul Levitz, Joe Staton and Joey Cavalieri. The character was chronologically introduced in Adventure Comics #464 (April 1979), but was unnamed in that comic. He was, however, named in his next appearance in Wonder Woman #281 (April 1981) and later, became Blackwing in Wonder Woman #297 (August 1982). Also, worth to note, the original story in Adventure Comics was intended for All Star Comics #75. Charlie was drawn as a teen in that story, but his next appearance (only three years later) depicts him as a young adult who graduated from law school. In his mid-teens, Charles Bullock was searching for a direction in life. The teenager found it after he helped fight off street punks alongside Wildcat (Ted Grant) and was invited to join him at his gym. Charlie attended law school and later became a junior partner and top- notch researcher to the law firm called Cranston, Grayson and Wayne. When a criminal named Karnage broke into the office looking for his boss, Arthur Cranston, this, and another event, led him to become the costumed hero Blackwing. Although his first outing as a crime fighter proved unsuccessful when he was captured by the costumed villain Boa's gang, Blackwing managed to contribute in freeing the Huntress (Helena Wayne) from Boa's giant snake and recorded some evidence that was used to put the mastermind and his men away. Since then, Blackwing has never appeared again in any other published story. =Vera Black= Vera Black is a British psionic cyborg in the DC Universe. The character, created by Joe Kelly and Doug Mahnke, first appeared in JLA #100 (August 2004). The storyline set up the limited series Justice League Elite which consisted of 12 issues published between 2004 and 2005. Within the context of the stories, Vera Black is the sister of Manchester Black. As children their parents would often fight and Manchester would take her out to play to avoid them. As his idea of \\"play\\" became killing sprees, Vera's perspective became twisted. When her brother dies after attempting to destroy Superman, she has her ruined arms, lost in an untold childhood incident, replaced with cybernetic prostheses which can configure into any weapon she desires, initially contemplating revenge on Superman before she decides to be better than her brother. Her new abilities result in her leading the remnants of the Elite and tacitly working with the Justice League. This leads to the League, encouraged by the Flash, asking her to lead a new team with the intention that she will handle black ops missions that the League cannot due to what they represent to the public, primarily involving hunting down and eliminating metahuman threats before they go public. Starting with Coldcast and Menagerie, she adds Flash, Manitou Raven, Major Disaster, Green Arrow and Kasumi to the team. She also enlists Naif al-Sheikh to keep the team in check and serve as a liaison to the governments of the world. Equipment of Vera Black Vera's cybernetic arms have the capacity to transform into an almost unlimited variety of melee, projectile and beam weapons. They also incorporate camouflage technology relying on optics, as well as altering sense perception in others. Vera Black in other media Vera Black appears in the direct- to-DVD animated feature Superman vs. The Elite, voiced by Marcella Lentz-Pope as an adult and by Tara Strong as a girl in a flashback sequence. =Block= Block is a young Maori woman living in Melbourne, Australia, the woman dubbed the Human Block was once inexplicably struck by lightning and survived the incident. Unknown to her, this similar event had happened to many other individuals throughout time and was in fact the Speed Force imbuing her with speed-related abilities. In her then-present time‚Äî1957‚ÄîBlock acted as a side show attraction in a carnival, the prize of $1,000 going to whoever could move her, which was failed by many, as she had manipulated her body density. One drunken man staggered onto the stage to accept her challenge, making her move by insulting her Maori heritage rather than physically moving her. Angered, she immediately struck out at him and instigated a small brawl, tearing through the crowd before someone hastily drew their firearm on her and shot, only to find that not even bullets affected her. Before the now-turned mob could attack her, Zoom, accompanied by his newly recruited acolytes the Folded Man and Magali, appeared and teleported her outside of the carnival grounds. Being offered the chance to embrace her abilities and live as a godlike being after mastering them, she did not hesitate to join Zoom and his quest to kill the \\"evil\\" Flash. Along with the other Acolytes, she would train for what would be an unknown amount of time to kill the Flash, facing off with Zoom in his place. It is unknown how long this training took place, as they stated that, over the course of centuries, this team trained to take on the Flash and when they reached older age, Magali would revert them back to their original ages when joining. Unknown to Block, Zoom is actually the one to have orchestrated her joining him to begin with, appearing to the drunk man who challenged her, while convincing him that the way to make her move was to attack her heritage, as he had been keeping close watch on her for some time. Powers and abilities of Block Being imbued with the Speed Force, Block has the unique ability to slow down her atoms. In doing this, they become denser than steel and grant her invulnerability, super-strength and immobility. She can possibly slow down other speedsters, if not other people as well, through physical touch, as she stopped the Top's ability to spin and was able to hold Zoom in place in a headlock. After training centuries with Zoom, she is a deadly fighter. Recently, she was able to stop the molecules around herself to make the air unbreakable. Block in other media Block appears in The Flash season 5 episode \\"Blocked\\" portrayed by Erin Cummings. Vanessa Jansen, nicknamed \\"Block\\" by Cisco Ramon, was a metahuman weapons dealer working for the East Street Skulls gang. Vanessa Jansen worked as a weapons dealer for the East Street Skulls gang, but was betrayed. She was subsequently arrested and sent to Iron Heights for four years. Through unknown means, Jansen acquired metahuman powers, which allowed her to create boxes of dense air. When Jansen got out of Iron Heights, either by escape or release, she took revenge on Bobby Moretti and killed him with her metahuman powers. She then robbed Bobby's warehouse of guns, planning to sell them. However, the buyer turned out to be Bobby's older brother, Bruno Moretti. He attempted to kill her out of revenge for Bobby's death, only for Jansen to save herself with her powers. She then tried to save Bruno, but was stopped by XS, who saved him instead. XS then tried to capture her, but Jansen trapped her in a block of dense air, causing the Flash to come out and confront her. Jansen threw XS into the air, forcing the Flash to save her, allowing Jansen to escape. Later, Jansen attempted to sell the weapons again, but was once again confronted by Bruni. Bruni arrived with backup, threatening to kill Jansen if she did not return the guns. They opened fire on her, but she shielded herself from the bullets using her powers.

However, he has since made the jump to these with his first appearance in the DC Universe in Catwoman #78 (April 2008), now known as Repro. Billy Numerous (real name William \\"Billy\\" Strayer) is a former student of the H.I.V.E. Academy and an enemy of the Teen Titans. Numerous first appeared as a student of the H.I.V.E Academy, where his power of self-duplication was subtly hinted at. After the H.I.V.E. was destroyed during Cyborg's confrontation with Brother Blood, Numerous and most of the other students went freelance. Later, Numerous engaged in a robbing spree all across Jump City and he stole anything he and his innumerable clones could get his (their) collective hands on. His power thoroughly confounded the Titans, especially Cyborg, who became all the more obsessed in catching him. Finally, however, Cyborg realized that there was another way of catching Numerous. He and the other Titans confronted Numerous in the old stadium where he had stashed his loot, seemingly with numerous copies of themselves. In order to bring them down, Numerous created even more clones of himself, but finally pushed his powers too far. The resulting reabsorption of each of his clones caused a massive physical and mental shock, stunning him and enabling his capture. To add insult to injury, the Titans' copies were not actual clones, but merely holographic projections created and controlled by Cyborg. At some point, Numerous entered Jinx's H.I.V.E. Five and was also recruited into the Brotherhood of Evil. As one of the Five, he participated in the attempted capture of Kid Flash, but even his numerous clones were unable to stop the super-speedster. Later, when the Brotherhood executed its worldwide strike against young superheroes, he and Gizmo were sent to capture Kole and Gnarrk in their subterranean retreat, but both heroes escaped them. When the remnants of the Titans under Beast Boy later attacked the Brotherhood's headquarters, Numerous and most of his H.I.V.E. Five teammates tried to run, but were intercepted by Kid Flash‚Äîand aghast to see that Jinx had switched sides and joined up with him. Moments later, they were all swept away by one of Jinx's hexes and carted off by Kid Flash for flash-freeze treatment. In Catwoman #78 (April 2008), a character based on Billy Numerous named Repro appears. The small-time crook known as Repro was operating in Gotham City during the time when many of the city's criminals disappeared for a short time. He was one of the only two criminals left in the city, with the other being the Thief. Repro was a young and inexperienced criminal who only did small-time criminal activities, just enough to stay off the radar of big-time crime fighters. After a confrontation with Catwoman where he thought he had shot her in the chest, he hastily departed and ran to the Thief to tell him about it. He was, in turn, shot in the chest and killed by the Thief, who then dumped his body in an alley to cover up the murder.

Operating from London, England, Dodger will steal and/or sell anything from information to advanced technology. At one point he came into possession of what appeared to be an alien spacecraft. Recognizing that the vehicle's stealth capabilities made it a lucrative commodity, he began leasing the vessel to various underworld figures, including the League of Assassins. When the vessel in question was linked to an assassination attempt against Connor Hawke, the Green Arrow and the Black Canary began investigating its activity. The trail led them to London where they (along with Mia \\"Speedy\\" Dearden) engaged in combat with Dodger at a local pub. Although Dodger proved to be an able-bodied physical combatant, \\"Team Arrow\\" subdued him and he told them about the League of Assassins. When pressed for more information, Dodger was unwilling to cooperate, so the Green Arrow and the Black Canary dropped him from the belly of a cargo plane suspended by a bungee cord until he agreed to give them better intelligence. He took them to his secret lair and triangulated the last location of the stealth ship he had leased. The Green Arrow and the Black Canary then persuaded him to accompany them on the search, which brought them to a castle in Leichestershire, England. They evaded several traps and finally discovered a cryogenics tube containing the compressed form of former Justice Leaguer Plastic Man. Dodger continued to work alongside \\"Team Arrow\\" and fought a team of metahumans who claimed to represent the League of Assassins. Dodger contributed very little to the battle; however, he did manage to distract one of them long enough for Batman to subdue him. Dodger continued adventuring with the group, battled foes and completed the adventure along with the team. After settling their business with the League of Assassins, Dodger accompanied \\"Team Arrow\\" back to the United States, where he struck up a romantic relationship with Mia Dearden. Mia has now left the States and traveled to London to continue this relationship. Dodger in other media Dodger appears in the TV series Arrow portrayed by James Callis. Appearing in the episode \\"Dodger\\", he is a British jewel thief who robs valuable jewels from wealthy occupants and sells them at a high price. Unlike the comics, this iteration of the character uses hostages with bomb collars to steal for him, rather than alien technology. He also uses a high voltage stun-stick as a weapon, which renders victims unconscious. His real name is Winnick Norton, a reference to the original creators of the character, Judd Winick and Mike Norton. He is defeated by Oliver and John Diggle when he is taken out with his own \\"shocker\\" after Oliver causes his car to crash, using an arrow as a dagger, and is arrested by a SCPD unit afterwards. In the Arrow: Season 2.5 tie-in comic, Norton escapes from prison and begins operating out of Bludhaven as part of a mercenary group called the Renegades. He and other members kidnap Felicity Smoak on the orders of Clinton Hogue, reminiscent how he kidnapped her earlier in \\"Dodger\\". Norton and other members are defeated by Oliver Queen, Roy Harper and Helena Bertinelli, leaving them bound and tipping off the police so they could arrest them. =Dominus= Dominus is a fictional character and a DC Comics supervillain who first appeared in Action Comics #747. He appears primarily as an opponent of Superman. Originally, Dominus was an alien priest named Tuoni, who served as one of the five custodians of his world's faith. During this time, he fell in love with his peer, Ahti. However, he was driven mad by jealousy when Ahti ascended past him and assumed the mantle of Kismet, Illuminator of All Realities. Studying infernal forbidden magic in an attempt to gain the power to challenge his former lover and rob her of the power of Kismet, Tuoni's assault was reflected by Kismet's divine energies and his body was incinerated. Despite Tuoni's deceit, the omnibenevolent Kismet showed him mercy and shunted his shattered, still-living body into the Phantom Zone. Within the Phantom Zone, Tuoni encountered a holographic projection of Superman's long-dead Kryptonian ancestor, Kem-L, who was able to use his own ancient variety of arcane Kryptonian science to rebuild the former holy man as a psionic, cosmic phantasm known as \\"Dominus\\". In this new all-powerful form, Dominus escaped the Zone via Superman's Fortress of Solitude and attacked Earth. Attempting to find Kismet to steal her cosmic powers, he was opposed by Superman. Swearing vengeance, Dominus telepathically entered Superman's mind and preyed on one of the Man of Steel's greatest weaknesses; his fear of failing the people of Earth. Using mind control, Dominus convinced Superman to take control of Earth and build the Superman robots to police the planet 24 hours a day, seven days a week forever. In another battle, Dominus used his reality-warping powers to become Superman, using the Superman robots to search for Kismet while Superman was disguised as one of his own robots and later as Dominus. During his captivity in these other forms Superman improved on his use of Torquasm Vo, an ancient Kryptonian warrior discipline technique where the warrior can control what they think. Superman and Dominus then engaged in a mental-physical battle with Dominus using any stray thought of Superman to reshape reality. The battle ends with Superman banishing Dominus to the Phantom Zone. Dominus uses his \\"Continuum Control\\" to alter reality and his \\"Control\\" to make people unaware that the change occurred. He can actually create more than one simultaneous reality, each one attacking a specific character's mental attributes. Dominus' realities were also inspired by other times in Superman's publishing history (the 1940s, 1960s and 1970s) and \\"The Superman of 2965‚Äì2966\\" story involving Muto.Superman #181 (Nov. 1965)Action Comics #338‚Äì339 (June‚ÄìJuly 1966) Dominus behind the scenes In a 1981 DC Treasury Special called Superman and his Fortress of Solitude, the Pre- Crisis Lex Luthor posed as a red-armored alien named Dominus as part of an elaborate ruse aimed at destroying the Man of Steel. =Dreadnought= The Dreadnought is a fictional character in DC Comics appearing in The New 52 continuity. He serves as an agent of the H.I.V.E., along with Psiphon. He appears in Superboy (vol. 4) #20, where he is sent by the H.I.V.E. to New York City to apprehend Doctor Psycho, who had escaped from a H.I.V.E. facility, and Superboy, whose psionic powers were of interest to the H.I.V.E. The two characters teamed up and managed to defeat the H.I.V.E. soldiers. The Dreadnought was sent flying by Superboy and landed in the Hudson River. The Dreadnought has undergone genetic modifications by the H.I.V.E. that mutated him into a giant purple humanoid beast with metallic armor and large black horns protruding from his head. He has superhuman strength and durability, which enables him to hold his own against even Superboy. =Carl Draper= Carl Draper is a fictional character in DC Comics, an enemy of Superman. He has gone by the names the Master Jailer, Kator, Deathtrap, the Locksmith and Castellan. Draper made his first appearance in Superman #331 (Jan. 1979), written by Martin Pasko and drawn by Curt Swan and Frank Chiaramonte. In the Pre-Crisis comics, Carl \\"Moosie\\" Draper grew up in Smallville (see Kator below). Draper was an overweight clumsy teenager whom most of the other kids never noticed or made fun of and was in love with Lana Lang, who had eyes only for Superboy, much to Draper's resentment. As an adult, Draper underwent a self-imposed self-improvement regimen, including exercise and cosmetic surgery, to overcome his physical shortcomings. He became an expert locksmith and architect, designing an inescapable prison for supervillains called \\"Mount Olympus\\". Impressed by the achievement, Superman augmented the prison's security by placing it on an antigravity platform. Initially dubbed \\"Draper's Island\\" by Superman, it was informally renamed \\"Superman Island\\" by the adult Lana‚Äîwith whom Draper remained smitten, just as she remained lovestruck by Superman. It was the latter name, plus the novelty of the floating platform, that caught public attention, diverting recognition from Draper himself. This proved the final straw for Draper, who snapped and became the costumed supervillain the Master Jailer. He attacked Superman and kidnapped Lana under that name. Superman defeated him and he was sent to his own prison.Superman #331‚Äì332 In New Adventures of Superboy #17 (May 1981), at the prodding of Carl, Superboy creates a robot named Kator as a sparring adversary (and gives the \\"safety cutoff switch\\" to Jonathan Kent). Kator, however, developed an artificial intelligence and almost killed the Boy of Steel before being destroyed (in New Adventures of Superboy #18). However, the robot apparently gave Draper its identity and powers before being destroyed. Draper (as the new Kator) then engages Superboy in combat. However, Jonathan Kent presses the safety switch on the \\"cutoff\\" device, which removes \\"Kator's\\" superpowers from Draper, and Superboy removes the memory of Draper ever being Kator. In the Post-Crisis comics, Carl Draper first appeared in Adventures of Superman #517 (Nov. 1994). This was during the \\"Dead Again\\" storyline, when Superman was suspected of being an impostor after his body was found still in his tomb (from The Death of Superman storyline). Draper was hired by S.T.A.R. Labs to design a holding cell for Conduit, when his daughter, Carla, asked him if he could build a prison that could hold even Superman. Draper initially designed a trap that only the real Superman could escape from, explaining this to Superman by way of a hologram of a costumed figure named Deathtrap. However, when Superman escaped the trap, Draper became obsessed with proving that he could capture the real thing. Of note, this version of Draper was dressed in casual wear, only getting an updated costume with chain-based attacks later. Draper made several other attempts to capture Superman, often programming the Deathtrap hologram in advance so he could publicly be elsewhere. On one occasion, in Superman: The Man of Steel #43 (April 1995), he programmed Deathtrap to appear during a Draper Security press conference and display how Draper's devices were being \\"subverted\\", thus both removing suspicion from him and acting as an advertisement for the company. In Action Comics #739, Superman (in his blue energy form) was captured in an \\"energy hobble\\" by Deathtrap, now calling himself the Locksmith. At the end of the story, it was revealed to the reader that his daughter, Carla Draper, was running the hologram this time and that her father was unaware of this. The now costumed- Master Jailer was one of the villains along with Neutron controlled by Manchester Black in the 2002 storyline \\"Ending Battle\\"; however, it was not clear that it was, in fact, Draper. Carl Draper appears in Checkmate #17 (Oct. 2007). At some point, Checkmate discovered his multiple identities and used this to force him into becoming a security consultant, protecting Checkmate itself from attack. In the issue, he prevents numerous assaults on Checkmate headquarters and is promoted to head of security with the title Castellan. Although he has not told his superiors, he strongly suspects that Carla is involved in the attacks. The issue also contains an easter egg‚Äîcomputer displays show an actual website (now defunct) that could be accessed with the username \\"CARL DRAPER\\" and the password \\"wilhelmina\\". The site was a journal and database written from Draper's perspective. In his journal, he claimed to have been only Deathtrap and that he was unconnected with the Post-Crisis Master Jailer. A DC Rebirth version of the Master Jailer appears in the Aquaman/Suicide Squad crossover \\"Sinking Atlantis\\" as a member of the Squad. Aspects of his Pre- and Post-Crisis history are present, with Carl growing up in Smallville and having a daughter.Suicide Squad #45 Alternate versions of Carl Draper Carl Draper appears in the Smallville comics-continuation Smallville Season 11 where his title is Warden Draper of Stryker's Island.Smallville Season 11 #5‚Äì6 Carl Draper in other media The Master Jailer appears in the live-action TV series Supergirl, portrayed by Jeff Branson. In this version, he is an alien from the planet Trombus who was a third-generation prison guard at Fort Rozz until the prison ship landed on Earth and many of the inmates escaped. He turned vigilante, hunting down and lynching several escapees until he was thwarted by Kara; in overview his methods were overzealous, as he even murdered aliens that were not violent and wanted peaceful lives. On Earth, he posed as Detective Draper of the National City Police Department. =Carla Draper= Carla Draper is the daughter of Carl Draper who made an appearance in Superboy #26 (May 1996) under the name Snare. She responded to a request from the Hawaiian Special Crimes Unit to Draper Security for assistance in capturing the supervillain Knockout, who was on the run with a misguided Superboy in tow. Snare, aware of her father's obsession, tried to prove that she could do something that he could not by capturing Superboy. This led to a fight with the SCU, during which Superboy and Knockout escaped. =Cal Durham= Cal Durham is a former henchman of Black Manta and a public figure in the DC Universe. The character, created by David Michelinie and Jim Aparo, first appeared in Aquaman #57 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1977). Within the context of the stories, Cal Durham is a mercenary hired by Black Manta under the pretense of establishing an African- American-dominated underwater society. To this end, Durham undergoes surgical procedures to emulate Atlantian physiology. Discovering that Manta is more focused on destroying Aquaman than fulfilling his social promise, he rebels. This results in Manta attempting to kill him and Duhram re-evaluating his goals. Much later, he appears as the mayor of Sub Diego. Cal Durham in other media In the comic book tie-in of the TV series Young Justice, Calvin Durham appears as Kaldur'ahm's foster father. Formerly a henchman of the supervillain Black Manta, Calvin's physiology was genetically modified to match that of an Atlantean's in order to infiltrate Atlantis, but defected to the Atlanteans and subsequently settled down with Aqualad's mother, Sha'lain'a of Shayeris.

In Flashpoint, Saul Erdel was a scientist in the Outsider's employ that captured and began experimenting on a Martian named J'onn J'onzz. Erdel died shortly after, leaving the alien in the Outsider's custody.Flashpoint: The Outsider #3 Dr. Saul Erdel in other media *In Justice League: The New Frontier, the film adaptation of the DC: The New Frontier comic book miniseries, Dr. Saul Erdel plays a minor role. Dr. Saul Erdel operated in an observatory outside of Gotham City's observatory. While conducting an experiment to sending radio signals into deep space, his experiment somehow accidentally teleported the Martian Manhunter (J'onn J'onzz) into his observatory. Erdel was surprised of J'onn's appearance and suffered a fatal heart attack. Before succumbing to his death, Erdel somberly apologized J'onn for stranding him on Earth and warns that human society will not take too kindly to him as people will fear him because of his appearance, and strongly recommended to him not to reveal himself and take the time to study humanity, using his image for a while before becoming a GCPD Detective.DC: The New Frontier #2 *Erdel makes a non-speaking cameo in Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths. He is seen during the telepathic flashback between J'onn and Rose Wilson. F =False Face= False Face is a name used by a number of different supervillains in the DC Universe. The concept and first character, created by Mort Weisinger and Creig Flessel, first appeared in Leading Comics #2 (spring 1942) using the name \\"Falseface\\". The name was later adjusted to \\"False Face\\" mirroring minor characters introduced by Fawcett Comics and Timely Comics. Variations of the character have been introduced in Batman #113 (February 1958) and Birds of Prey #112 (January 2008). In all instances the character is only identified as \\"False-Face\\" or by an alias while in disguise. First Golden Age False Face The first False-Face seen was among the five small-time criminals hired by organizer Black Star. Along with his colleagues Captain Bigg, Hopper, Brain and Rattler, he staged a robbery at a city bank by disguising himself as a construction worker. False-Face drilled through a water main and used the pressurised escaping water to blast a hole into the bank. After he and his friends robbed the bank, they used a paddy wagon as their getaway vehicle while disguised as police officers. Under the orders of Black Star, False-Face was sent to New Orleans to rob riches from those sponsoring the Mardi Gras event. He and his henchmen disguised themselves as a Clown Krewe and insinuated themselves onto a parade float. This managed to attract the attention of Shining Knight who was in the area at the time. False-Face escaped, but his henchmen were apprehended. He then attempted to steal the Star Sapphire Gem from Mardi Gras organizer J.J. Ennis. To do this, False-Face disguised himself as a police detective and infiltrated Ennis' house. He once again fought against the Shining Knight, and briefly subdued him, but the Shining Knight escaped from False-Face's trap and defeated him. False-Face was then arrested by the police. At this point, it was discovered that the unpleasant face he usually presented was not false at all. Much later, he confronts the Star-Spangled Kid. Second Golden Age False Face A different False Face dies in a confrontation with Captain Marvel, Jr. While not the same character as created for DC, the publisher would later license and eventually purchase the characters and stories that Fawcett published. The material would be assigned to \\"Earth-S\\" within the continuity of the DC Universe. Silver Age False Face The late 1950s version of the character, created by an uncredited writer and Sheldon Moldoff, appeared once in Batman #113. Little is known of the Caped Crusaders' first meeting with the villain, but on their second chance encounter they found that he had impersonated a wealthy uranium tycoon named P.S. Smithington. As Smithington, False-Face robbed a Gotham City jewelry store, framing the true Smithington for the crime. Batman managed to rescue the actual Smithington, but was unable to recover the stolen jewels. At police headquarters, Commissioner James Gordon supplied Batman and Robin with information about the case and the two gave chase. This time, False-Face kidnapped rock star Wally Weskit during a charity benefit concert and concealed him in an elevator shaft. As False-Face assumed the form of Wally Weskit, his henchman Pebbles attempted to make off with the charity proceeds. Batman and Robin managed to prevent this, but False-Face and his gang escaped. The third time that False-Face struck, he impersonated a safari hunter named Arthur Crandall in order to get into the Gotham City's Explorer Club. While attempting to steal the club's Golden Tiger Trophy, Batman and Robin arrived and were on his heels again. He lured Batman towards a large water tank and managed to temporarily trap him, but the Dark Knight detective succeeded in outsmarting False Face and his men, apprehending the entire group in the process. False Face was taken to prison whereupon he soon retired from his life of crime. Modern Age False Face The late 2000s version of the character, created by Tony Bedard and David Cole, first appeared in Birds of Prey #112 (January 2008).

False-Face was hired by Kobra to smuggle a deadly virus from Saint Denis to Gotham City so that Kobra can mass-infect the entire city for a ransom of 10 billion credits. Little did False-Face know that he was secretly infected with it. He ended up running afoul of Batman and Stalker where he tried to evade both of them.

The unique feature of the Hyenas was that they turned into werehyena forms whenever they were under great emotional stress, not only when there was a full moon. This meant that they could attack foes in broad daylight and that they would revert into their human forms when their emotional tension was relieved.

K =Adeline Kane= Adeline Kane, formerly Adeline Wilson, is best known as both the leader of the criminal organization the H.I.V.E. and the ex-wife of Slade Wilson, a.k.a. Deathstroke the Terminator. An enemy of the Teen Titans, Adeline made her first appearance in New Teen Titans #34 (August 1983). She was brought up as a wealthy jet-setting playgirl, despite being trained by a father who had worked with Chinese guerrilla forces. But after a traumatic first marriage at 19, she joined the U.S. military, where she met, trained, and married Slade Wilson. After Slade left the military, Slade and Adeline took up the socialite lifestyle Adeline had been raised into. Unbeknownst to her, Slade was using his hunting trips to gain clients for his mercenary side job, which resulted in the kidnapping and near-death of their younger son, Joseph. Enraged and betrayed by Slade's prioritization of Deathstroke's honor code over their son's well-being, Adeline shot her husband and, when he survived, served him with divorce papers. Grant, who had idolized his father, rebelled against his mother and ran away to New York, where he ran into the Titans and ended up dying due to his alliance with the H.I.V.E. Slade vowed to pick up his dead son's contract against the Teen Titans; Adeline promptly interfered; she blamed Slade for Grant's death. Due to Adeline's intervention, Joseph, who had been working with her, joined the Titans as Jericho. Joseph eventually became possessed by the spirits of Azarath. Begging his father to kill him in order to prevent the corrupted spirits from achieving their purpose, Adeline's only remaining son died at her husband's hand. Adeline found this out from one of her Searchers Inc. agents, rather than from Slade himself, which merely cemented her long-held grudge against her ex-husband. Slade, however, held no grudge against her, keeping an eye out for her safety and attempting to aid her when he thought he could get away with it; e.g., when Adeline had been abducted by her first husband Morel, a.k.a. Count Tavolera, who had poisoned her in an attempt to force her to work with him to discover her ancestor Josiah Kane's treasure. To save Adeline's life, Slade gave her some of his own serum-altered blood. This ended up driving her crazy; Slade's genotype had a unique mutation which enabled him to effectively metabolize his serum. Other less fortunate people either died or went insane. For a time, Adeline went underground, slowly losing more and more of her normal cognitive abilities, though none of her tactical skills. She eventually turned herself into the H.I.V.E. Mistress, in her madness focusing on superheroes as the reason for her sons' death and creating a plan to kill all the superheroes that she could. Her plot ultimately resulted in her death. Vandal Savage put a team together to take advantage of Adeline's plan, intending to take her immortal blood to create a sort of Fountain of Youth potion. With her throat cut, unable to die and yet unable to fully heal, Adeline regained her sanity briefly and pleaded with Slade (who had learned of her involvement and arrived to try and save her) to kill her and reunite her with their children. However, because he still had feelings for her no matter what she had done, he was unable to comply with her request, so Starfire killed her instead. Adeline Kane in other media Adeline made her live- action debut in season 2 of Titans portrayed by Mayko Nguyen. Adeline appears in Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons, voiced by Sasha Alexander. =Kilg%re= *Creators: Mike Baron and Jackson Guice *First appearance: Flash (vol. 2) #3 (August 1987) Kilg%re was an electro-mechano-organic intelligence that needed electro-life to survive. It consumed its entire home planet in the Pleides sector and then moved on into space. It was attacked by something known as Meta#sker and placed into a vibrational limbo. Somehow, it found its way to the flats near Salt Lake City on Earth. It could only be seen by people traveling at high speeds, such as an F-15 pilot or the Flash. The Flash unknowingly released it from the limbo it was imprisoned in and it followed him to S.T.A.R. Labs and took over its electrical systems. Kilg%re found the number of machines on Earth ideal for its survival, but humans it deemed distractions and planned to destroy them. It delivered an ultimatum: abandon North America by 12:00 noon on May 10 or be destroyed. During a battle with the Flash in Salt Lake City, it turned out all the power in the country. The Flash sought the help of Cyborg, who used the Titans' satellite to relay the message to the governments of the world to shut down all power in order to kill Kilg%re. This scared it out of the power grid and it weaved a giant mechanical snake across the Utah flats, trying to complete a circuit by catching up with the cloned body of S.T.A.R. Labs' Dr. Schmitz in order to survive. However, the Flash outraced it, supposedly killing it. After Kilg%re's defeat at the hands of the Flash he appeared to be destroyed, but resurfaced in the form of a sentient computer mind hidden in a self-created computer operating system in a deep cave. When Maxwell Lord was spelunking one day, his then-president had fallen deep into the cave where Kilg%re lay dormant. Sensing a human life, Kilg%re decided to help coax Max into further succeeding his own plans, as well as Max's subconscious plans of self- actualization. To do this, Kilg%re decided to help Max start the new Justice League and grow the group into becoming more international. Kilg%re served in a behind-the-scenes role, constantly coaxing and manipulating Max into furthering his plans, such as gaining money, power and cutting-edge technology to give Kilg%re a stronger machine to inhabit. Through such advantages, Kilg%re and Max were able to create a better duplicate of the Justice League signal device, begin a recruitment drive and find willing villains, gaining additional muscle such as Booster Gold and a new Ace android. Kilg%re grew impatient and decided to start using bigger ideas, such as inciting an international incident to distract Justice League International. To do this, he found hidden technologies designed as a monitoring device by Metron. He launched the satellite, which was only defeated by Mister Miracle because he was used to New God technology. A serious mishap occurred during the Millenium event, in which the Manhunters took over the bodies of those they deemed were close enough to major figures to do damage. One of these Manhunters took over the body of the secretary of Max and, when she delivered coffee to him, she shot him four times. Rushing to Max's safety, Kilg%re promptly eliminated the threat by combining some of his technology with Max in order to save his life and kill the Manhunter. Max eventually learned of Kilg%re's tampering when half of Kilg%re was destroyed by the construct falling through the building that housed Kilg%re. In Kilg%re's fleeting moments, he threw another series of visions designed to tamper with Max's thoughts and implant Kilg%re into another larger system. Max refused and destroyed what was left of Kilg%re's last computing body. Doing so removed the cyborg self-repairing systems in Max's body, which landed him in the hospital. Kilg%re, however, was not completely destroyed. Kilg%re appeared in DC Rebirths Cyborg #01, 02 and 18 and The Flash/Speed Buggy Special #1. Powers and abilities of Kilg%re Kilg%re has a robot body, electrokinesis, electronic interaction, electronic disruption, electronic constructs, and superhuman speed.

Baron later found her picture on Gambi's computer when trying to find out who tried to have Gambi killed. Lady Eve was shown to be revived offscreen and is the head of the Ultimate O business where she starts to develop some competition with Lala and the remnants of the 100. =Lillian Luthor= Lillian Luthor (portrayed by Alisen Down) was the mother of Alexander Luthor and Julian Luthor, as well as the wife of Lionel Luthor. Smallville Lillian had a long and prolific role in the TV series Smallville. Lillian came from a wealthy family. How she met Lionel is unclear, but they were married sometime before the 1980s. By all accounts, Lillian was a caring, beautiful and sophisticated person, as well as comments made by Lex and Lionel have indicated that she had a spirited personality, had ambitions of her own and often stood up to Lionel. Eventually, Lillian began to wonder about the special projects that Lionel had. She searched for answers and found something called \\"Veritas\\". However, Alexander saw her going through his father's briefcase, so Lillian asked him not to tell anyone. When Lionel found out, he immediately blamed Alexander and forced him to tell the truth. When Alexander did, Lillian insisted Lionel explain what Veritas was, but Lionel knocked her to the floor instead and warned her not to look into his projects again. Lillian felt angered and disgusted by Alexander's betrayal. Sometime later, Lillian became ill with a heart condition that worsened over the rest of her life. Lionel hired a nurse named Rachel Dunleavy to assist her. Rachel and Lionel subsequently had an affair, resulting in the birth of Lionel's illegitimate son, Lucas. It is unclear whether Lillian knew of the affair or the child. Lillian was helped by a nanny, Pamela Jenkins, who Alexander regarded as a second mother. Lionel was often absent from home and Lillian insisted that he take Alexander on one of his business trips to Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. Lionel's resulting shame and constant critique of Alexander bothered Lillian greatly. Sometime in the early 1990s, Lionel insisted that they have another child, an idea that Lillian was highly opposed to, presumably because of her poor health. However, when Alexander was 11, Lillian became pregnant again. She insisted that Alexander be allowed to come home for school from Excelsior Academy and Lionel complied. Her pregnancy was strenuous and Lillian was bedridden for much of it. On Alexander's disastrous 12th birthday (which no one attended), Lillian gave him a lead box allegedly made from the armor of St. George, which he kept into adulthood and later gave to Clark Kent. After baby Julian's birth, Lillian descended into a deep case of postpartum depression, refusing to hold the child and crying perpetually. One evening, Lionel sent the baby's nanny home and insisted that Lillian bond with the child. Lillian expressed her concern that Lionel would pit the two boys against each other and announced that she wanted a divorce, a threat that she had apparently made many times and that Lionel had called \\"tiresome\\". On returning home from work one night, Lionel discovered Alexander in the baby's nursery. Alexander immediately apologized and confessed to accidentally killing Julian while trying to stop him from crying. Lionel erupted into a fierce rage and struck Alexander. Their relationship never recovered, even after he became an adult. It was not until years later, after receiving experimental therapy to recall repressed memories, that he remembered that Lillian had in fact smothered the baby during one of her delusions, hoping to spare him from Lionel's maltreatment. Alexander took the blame, correctly assuming that his father would cover it up in order to protect his sole heir, although he would probably be less inclined to do so for his wife. Sometime before her death Lillian, along with Lex and Lionel, went to a ranch in Montana to spend time together. During that time, a snake spooked Lillian's horse, prompting Lionel to save her and wait on her until she was better. After Julian's death, Lillian's health rapidly deteriorated and she died several months later in the spring of 1993 when Alexander was 13. He later confessed to Clark that he was in denial about her impending death and spent the time researching treatments and doctors instead of being with her. Lex also told Lana Lang that he was away at boarding school when Lillian died and found out about her passing from reporters who had sneaked into his school. Lillian left her shares of LuthorCorp to her son and Pamela. Lillian's death was extremely influential in the adult Lex's life. He had visions of his mother on many occasions. When Lex was shot and ended up in a coma, he had a near-death experience. In it, Lillian visited him and showed Lex an alternate life of happiness that he could have if he would simply walk away from Lionel and LuthorCorp. However, at the end of the vision, Lana (his dream wife) suffered complications during childbirth. Because of Lex's lack of resources and estrangement from his father, he was unable to transfer Lana to a better facility and she died: this led Lex to believe that Lana died because he lacked enough money and power: with these, everything else in life could be secured. As a result, Lex ignored his mother's warning and continued his lifestyle of deceit and corruption. After realizing this, Lillian was seen in the reflection of a hospital window crying over her son's choice. When Lex was injected with the Limbo drug, which placed its users in a state of \\"clinical death\\", he met Lillian again, who told him that she was angry with him for ignoring her advice. When Lex was shot and went into a coma, Clark Kent and Lionel used a machine that allowed Clark to enter Lex's mind in order to find Lois Lane and Kara Kent. In Lex's mind, Clark met a young version of Lex and the two hid from a psychotic and murderous adult Lex. In the memory featuring Lillian snooping in Lionel's briefcase, Clark witnessed Lionel's verbal and physical abuse of both Lex and Lillian, as well as watched Lex try to help his mother up, but Lillian uncharacteristically told him that he had done enough and walked away from him. Lillian Luthor in comics In DC Comics, Lex Luthor's mother is named Arlene Luthor. In later incarnations, her name was changed to \\"Leticia\\" even though she remained unnamed in most of her appearances. Lillian Luthor in other media Lillian Luthor (known as the Doctor) appears in Supergirl, portrayed by Brenda Strong. Dr. Lillian Luthor is a scientist, the leader of Project Cadmus, the wife of the late Lionel Luthor, the mother of Lex Luthor and the adoptive mother of Lena Luthor. =Lunkhead= Lunkhead is an enemy of Batman who became an inmate at Arkham Asylum. Lunkhead was clearly stupid, but exhibited massive strength; he made an enemy of the Ventriloquist (Arnold Wesker) when he smashed Wesker's companion, Scarface. He was sacrificed to the devil by a pack of demons, along with many others, when the Ventriloquist threw his voice to make it seem as though Lunkhead was volunteering to be thrown into the fiery pit with the rest of the damned. Lunkhead in other media * Lunkhead appears in Beware the Batman, voiced by JB Blanc. He is a reformed criminal who was beaten into a coma for two months by Batman. He was part of a therapy program in Blackgate Penitentiary alongside Margaret Sorrow. Lunkhead was released and has been a reformed criminal. Lieutenant James Gordon asks him about Margaret, bribing him with chocolate. * Lunkhead appears in the Gotham episode \\"A Dark Knight: One of My Three Soups\\", portrayed by Hank Strong. This version is an African- American strongman and had known Jerome Valeska's uncle Zachary Trumble. When he showed up to assist Zachary, Jerome spilled some soup on him. Upon Bruce Wayne arriving, he fought against Lunkhead and defeated him. M =Matches Malone= Matches Malone was originally a Gotham gang boss who Batman attempted to recruit to help him take down Ra's al Ghul. When he was accidentally killed by a ricocheting bullet that was meant for Batman, Batman began to impersonate him to use his underworld contacts and to fool Ra's. Post-Crisis, he was a relatively small-time arsonist with his brother Carver and who came to Gotham City early on in Batman's career, attracting Batman's attention when Carver was apparently murdered. Although Matches was the prime suspect, there was no concrete evidence to make the charges stick and Matches was released, only for Batman to subsequently find what appeared to be Matches' dead body in another fire, apparently a suicide. However, Batman never reported the death; at the time, he had been attempting to establish a criminal alias for himself to help him gather information, but the exclusive nature of the criminal sects meant that no one would recruit someone that they had not heard of, prompting him to adopt Matches' identity and use it for his own. However, years later, Batman learned the truth about what had happened. Carver's death had actually been a suicide prompted by his guilt over a fire that he and Matches had started that resulted in the death of a homeless man resting in the building they had torched, with Matches making the body look like a murder victim because he was ashamed of his brother's suicide. Subsequently, deciding to escape Batman stalking him for the crime, Matches used the body of their earlier victim to fake his own death, with Batman being so eager to establish his criminal alias that he never took the time to definitively confirm the body's identity. After operating underground for years by committing low-end robberies, Matches returned to Gotham after hearing reports of 'his' activities, only to be shot by Scarface for 'his' recent betrayal, surviving long enough to simply confess his role in events to Batman and Nightwing before dying, with his last request being that Batman bury him next to his brother Carver. Having destroyed Scarface in 'revenge' for Matches' death, Batman commented to Nightwing later on that he continued using the Matches identity because, in the years he had spent playing Matches, he had come to recognize that Matches was not an evil man, but had done some bad things that he never had the chance to make up for, regarding his use of Matches' name as a chance to give Matches some absolution. The \\"Matches Malone\\" identity indirectly caused the events of Batman: War Games; after she was fired as Robin, Stephanie Brown attempted to implement an old plan of Batman's that would allow him to take control of the city's criminal organisations, hoping that this would impress Batman enough to convince him to take her back. Unfortunately, she was unaware that Batman's agent who was meant to take control of the meeting, Matches Malone, was actually Batman himself, resulting in tensions between the crime families flaring up and most of them being killed in the subsequent stand-off, leading into the subsequent gang wars and Stephanie's own apparent death. In The Batman Adventures comic book series, Batman uses the Matches Malone guise against the False Face Society and a backstory reveals Malone was a low-level enforcer for Rupert Thorne who agreed to become a snitch for Batman and Commissioner Gordon against Thorne. But, when Malone began skimming cash from Thorne, he was shot to death by \\"two Chicago triggers\\" who go by the monikers Dapper (for always dressing well) and Cricket (for his short wiry build). Upon finding the dying Malone and being told that his killers went to a well-known Chinese restaurant, Batman removed his glasses‚Äîand was shocked by what Malone looked like. Batman took Malone's guise, defeated the two hitmen and sent them to prison, and has used the guise ever since. Matches Malone in other media * In the aborted Tom Mankiewicz script The Batman, the character is named Jimmy Malone, being a simple criminal accomplice to the Joker.http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/batmanscript1.txt * The character, renamed Matthew \\"Matches\\" Malone, is used in Batman: The Brave and the Bold as an alias by Batman (voiced by Diedrich Bader). In the episode \\"Chill of the Night!\\", Batman uses the name variation during a trip to the past with the Phantom Stranger to see Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne years before their deaths and unaware that Malone is their grown son. In the episode \\"The Mask of Matches Malone!\\", Batman gets amnesia while in his Matches Malone persona and believes himself to actually be a gangster. * The character appears again, this time renamed Patrick \\"Matches\\" Malone, in the live-action Gotham TV series, portrayed by Danny Schoch in his first masked appearance and by Michael Bowen in the second appearance. This version is a philosophical hitman-for-hire who is one of Gotham City's deadliest murderers and was an old partner of Mutants leader Terence \\"Cupcake\\" Shaw. He is the masked man in shiny shoes who killed Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne in front of Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle (who was watching from the highest part of the fire escape), taking Joe Chill's place in the comics and most adaptations. This has led Detective James Gordon into finding him in order to bring to justice. Silver St. Cloud revealed the killer's identity to be Patrick. When Bruce finally confronts Patrick, Patrick stated that he was tired of doing bad things, while barely recalling if he killed Bruce's parents and Bruce decides not to kill Patrick. Using the gun that Bruce left behind, Patrick committed suicide by the time Gordon caught up with Bruce. Gordon and Harvey Bullock were left wondering who could have hired Malone to kill Thomas and Martha (which was eventually revealed to be Hugo Strange). =Menagerie= Menagerie is a name shared by two anti-heroines in the DC Universe, both members of the Elite.

She is taken into JLA custody, deprived of the aliens, and begins a gradual separation that they hope will sever her connection to the symbeasts.Justice League Elite #12 Powers and abilities of Menagerie The symbeasts can be assembled to shift over the host to form various shapes and weapons such as claws, spikes or whips. Most commonly, they form around the body and take the form of wings, enabling Menagerie to fly. She can also instruct them to take other forms, or detach from her body and operate independently. One creature has a bite that can force its victims to tell the truth. According to Vera Black, there is also a creature among the creche that can create bio-electric bursts.

In addition, Thomas expanded the character's backstory and origin so that it incorporated large chunks of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket by Edgar Allan Poe and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne. Within the context of the stories, Neptune Perkins is a mutant born with attributes that lend themselves to living at sea. During World War II he works with the All-Star Squadron. After the war he weds Miya Shimada, though this relationship becomes strained in part by his being unaware that he is not the father of their daughter, Debbie.

He is killed in Infinite Crisis #3 when the Shark and King Shark together attack and partially devour him during an undersea battle. =Pozhar= Mikhail Arkadin is a Soviet superhero known as the Soviet Firestorm and Pozhar (Russian: –ø–æ–∂–∞—Ä, \\"wildfire\\"). Mikhail Denisovitch Arkadin originally was an intellectual attached to the Chernobyl power plant, and was present during its catastrophe; his metagene was activated, and he gained the ability to create an all-consuming fire. Unfortunately, that same fire destroyed most of his body, and he was forced to wear a containment suit in order to prevent himself from destroying everything he touched. The Russian government then maneuvered him into position to be one of its premier heroes, placing him into a battle against the original Firestorm, who was then calling for complete nuclear disarmament. The battle raged for a time between the two heroes, until a nuclear weapon was dropped on the duo while they fought in the Nevada desert. From that debacle arose a new Firestorm, in which Mikhail played a crucial role, along with the original two members of the Firestorm Matrix, Martin Stein and Ronnie Raymond. He continued as a member of Firestorm in another incarnation, as an Elemental, but was eventually removed from the Firestorm Matrix so that Martin alone could bear the powers. Ronnie and Mikhail returned to their homes, de-powered. During the \\"In My Father's House\\" storyline in the most recent Firestorm series, it was revealed that Mikhail is, in fact, once again in control of his former abilities. He was re-powered by a nuclear test gone wrong in Russia. After going by the name of Firestorm for a time (not knowing that a new Firestorm made up of Jason Rusch and Martin Stein had been in operation for some time), he has now changed his identity back to Pozhar.Firestorm the Nuclear Men (vol. 3) #27 (September 2006)Firestorm the Nuclear Men (vol. 3) #29 (November 2006) In The New 52, a reboot of the DC Universe, Professor Mikhail Arkadin helped Professor Martin Stein invent the Firestorm Protocols.The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men #4 (February 2012)The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men #8-12 (June‚ÄìAugust 2012) In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Pozhar appears as a member of the People's Heroes. He appears on TV, announcing that Russia is closing their borders to all foreigners, be they metahuman or not. During his interview on \\"the Superman Theory\\", Firestorm used a profanity to describe it and even used another profanity to insult Pozhar, much to the dismay of Martin Stein.Doomsday Clock #5 (May 2018). DC Comics Pozhar joined the People's Heroes in trying to catch Firestorm when he was accused of turning some Russians into glass. This causes Superman to come to Firestorm's defense, much to the dismay of Batman.Doomsday Clock #8 (December 2018). DC Comics Pozhar in other media Mikhail Arkadin appears in Legends of Tomorrow, portrayed by Voytek Skrzeta. When the Legends infiltrate Luskavic Labs looking into Vandal Savage's Operation Svarog, Arkadin leads Soviet soldiers in capturing Martin Stein, Ray Palmer and Mick Rory and takes them to the Koshmar prison camp.

He is killed when Valentina Vostok (as Firestorm) becomes unstable, causing a nuclear explosion at Koshmar. =Preus= Preus is a fictional DC Comics supervillain who first appeared in Adventures of Superman #625 (April 2004) and was created by Joe Kelly and Talent Caldwell.Adventures of Superman #625 (April 2004) For years, Sergeant Preus had proudly served the Citizen's Patrol Corps, a police force that kept the peace in Kandor under the Kryptonian banner of El, their \\"creator\\". Due to the compression of time, more than a century had passed inside the bottle city (compared to only a handful of years outside it) during which Preus and his fellow Kandorians had come to worship \\"The Superman\\" as their \\"god in heaven\\" above. The Corpsman was also a devout xenophobe, who dispensed justice against \\"non-K\\" (Kryptonian) dissidents that threatened their way of life, especially a citizen named Kal-El, who forever tainted Paradise when he seemingly murdered several Kandorians. Preus swore a solemn oath to make the murderer pay, not realizing that Kal-El was actually the Superman that he and the others had worshiped for so long.Action Comics #813 (May 2004) He was also unaware that the \\"victims\\" were constructs created by an alien telepath, Lyla, who had brainwashed Kal-El into believing that Kandor was a never-exploded Krypton.Adventures of Superman #626 (May 2004) Eventually shattering the illusion, Superman escaped Kandor and confronted Lyla back in Metropolis. Preus followed them, but exposure to Earth's air and yellow sun drastically affected him, giving him strange, new powers equal to Superman's while amplifying his already-unbalanced racist views.Superman (vol. 2) #202‚Äì203 (April‚ÄìMay 2004) Convinced that Kal-El had defiled the legacy of \\"The Superman\\", Preus swore to assume that responsibility himself and that all of the impure would die by his hand. His xenophobia led him to a group of white supremacists in the American desert, who he forced into worshiping him and his views. However, in time, the people of \\"God's Peake\\" (as the camp was called) came to worship Preus as their cult leader. His increasing prominence eventually led both the Martian Manhunter and Jimmy Olsen to investigate, only to have both of them captured by Preus and his men.Action Comics #821 (January 2005) This forced a confrontation with Superman, who, at the time, was dealing with the effects of Gog's synthetic yellow kryptonite, which had significantly aged and weakened Superman in a short period of time. So weakened, Superman was barely able to deal with Preus' legions alone and quickly found himself outclassed by the (at the time) much more vital Preus.Action Comics #822 (February 2005) A last-ditch gambit using kryptonite to try and weaken Preus failed, as Preus revealed a previously unknown resistance to kryptonite. However, he was finally defeated when Superman attacked and destroyed a key portion of Preus' armor, rendering him unconscious. Afterwards, Preus was injured from that attack and had to be hospitalized. His current whereabouts are unknown. He was last seen as a weakened Superman tried to fly him to S.T.A.R. Labs for treatment. Preus disappeared after Superman was engaged by an army of Gogs.Action Comics #825 (May 2005) Powers and abilities of Preus Preus possesses powers similar to those of Superman, such as superhuman strength and speed, flight, invulnerability, X-ray vision and enhanced senses. Unlike Superman, Preus can fire beams of black energy from his eyes that strike a target with intense heat and force. Preus also does not share Superman's vulnerability to kryptonite. =Psiphon= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity.

However, when the company developed the self-generating power source known as Promethium, the temptation was too much for him.New Titans #8 Through his robot puppets, the Puppeteer took control of Cyborg, Kid Flash, Starfire, and Wonder Girl and turned them against their teammates. Raven's soul-self was finally able to break their trance and the Titans united to battle the Puppeteer and his toy robotic army.

In tribute to Yuda Kal, the witches made a specific mix of chemicals and magic spells to create the Worldkillers using the Harun- El, a Kryptonian metal with magical properties. The Worldkillers (Reign, Purity and Pestilence) were launched during the final days of Krypton when it exploded, landing on Earth.

After Thomas ended on prison, another member Olivia assumed the leadership. In the season three episode \\"The Fanatical\\", using Yuda Kal's recipe documented in Coville's journal, Olivia was able to gain powers through an Harun-El statue of the goddess and briefly turned into a Worldkiller-like vessel with the goal of carrying out Reign's deliverance on Earth, but she is ultimately defeated by Supergirl, stripping her powers and Olivia becoming normal human.

The character, created by John Ostrander and Joe Brozowski, first appeared in Firestorm the Nuclear Man #69 (March 1988). Within the context of the stories, the Zuggernaut crashes to earth as a meteorite in Russia. It was found by, and bonded to, Matvei Rodor, a black marketeer. Rodor is in conflict with a corrupt Moscow prosecutor named Soliony and agrees to the Zuggernaut's offer of help in exchange for being its host. Returning to Moscow, they attack Soliony, who has been interrogating Mikhail Arkadin. Arkadin summons Firestorm and escapes the jail to find the Zuggernaut threatening Soliony. The Zuggernaut is driven off when Firestorm burns impressions of his hand into their chest. The Zuggernaut reappears a short time later and allows itself to be captured in order to get to Soliony. Again Firestorm intervenes, creating discord for both the host and the alien. Their fight with Firestorm is interrupted by Stalnoivolk, allowing Rodor to override the Zuggernaut's desire to fight Firestorm and chase after Soliony. They, in turn, are delayed by the Russian super-team Soyuz, allowing Firestorm to catch up and stop them. This results in Rodor being mortally wounded and the Zuggernaut withdrawing to find a new host. Powers and abilities of the Zuggernaut When bonded with a host, the Zuggernaut can take the form of a tall, purple alien creature possessing long, sharp claws and fangs. It also has a green gemstone embedded in its forehead which is capable of firing energy beams. The Zuggernaut can also project beams of energy from his eyes and has the ability to leap great distances. =Zor-El= See also * List of DC Comics characters * List of Marvel Comics characters References :: Batman titles :: Firestorm titles :: Green Lantern titles :: Superman titles :: Additional comics * ","title":"List of minor DC Comics characters"},{"id":"31561823","text":"Warren C. \\"Brady\\" Cowell (December 12, 1899 ‚Äì April 15, 1989) was an American college football, basketball, and baseball coach and college athletic director.

Production Katharine Cornell as Elizabeth Barrett in the original Broadway production of The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1931) The Barretts of Wimpole Street was Rudolf Besier's only real success as a playwright. It was first staged August 20, 1930, at the Malvern Festival in Malvern, Worcestershire. Directed by Sir Barry Jackson, the production starred Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as Elizabeth Barrett Moulton-Barrett and Scott Sunderland as Robert Browning. Besier then turned to the United States, but was rebuffed by no fewer than 27 producers, before the actress Katharine Cornell took a personal interest in the play and had it staged at the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland, Ohio in 1931. The role of Elizabeth Barrett worked so well for Cornell that it became her signature role.Stanley Hochman, McGraw- Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama The Barretts of Wimpole Street then went to Broadway, where it opened on February 9, 1931, at the Empire Theatre, starring Katharine Cornell and Brian Aherne.IBDB It was revived there in 1934 and 1945.

Completed in 1940, the ship spent the war in Norwegian and French waters, escorting German ships and occasionally engaging Allied warships. In early 1941 she escorted ships between the Baltic and southern Norway before spending four months protecting ships as they transited through the Bay of Biscay. A few months after the Operation Barbarossa began in June, Z23 was transferred to northern Norway where she attempted to intercept one of the Arctic convoys returning from the Soviet Union and helped to lay several minefield. Transferred to back to France in early 1943 where she resumed her former role of escorting ships through the Bay of Biscay, which were threatened by Allied aircraft and cruisers attempting to prevent Axis blockade runners from reaching port through the bay. One such mission resulted in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay at the end of the year, in which Z23 played a minor role. On 12 August, she was bombed by British heavy bombers and was declared a constructive total loss. The French salvaged her after the war and used her as a source of spare parts for the ex- German destroyers that they had in service. The ship was condemned in 1951 and later broken up. Design and description Wartime Allied recognition manual drawing of the Type 36A destroyer The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936 class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a maximum draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by six Wagner water-tube boilers for a designed speed of . Z23 carried a maximum of of fuel oil which gave a range of at . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.Gr√∂ner, pp. 203‚Äì04 The ship carried four TbtsK C/36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, one forward of the superstructure and three aft. Her anti-aircraft armament consisted of four C/30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and five C/30 guns in single mounts. Z23 carried eight above-water torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchger√§t) passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S-Ger√§t sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with either a FuMO 21 or FuMO 24/25 radar set above the bridge.Gr√∂ner, pp. 203, 205; Koop & Schmolke, p. 103; Whitley, pp. 68, 71‚Äì72 =Modifications= Z23s single forward 15 cm gun was exchanged for a 15 cm LC/38 twin-gun turret during her early-1942 refit. This exacerbated the Type 36A's tendency to take water over the bow and reduced their speed to . By 1944, the ship's anti-aircraft suite had been augmented by a pair of quadruple 2 cm mounts that may have been added during her early-1942 refit.Gr√∂ner, p. 203; Koop & Schmolke, p. 103; Whitley, p. 73  Service history  Z23 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W957 on 15 November 1938, launched on 15 December 1939, and commissioned on 15 September 1940. After working up, she began escorting ships between the Baltic and southern Norway between March and June 1941, notably the battleship and the heavy cruisers , . On 12‚Äì13 June Z23 was one of the escorts for the heavy cruiser L√ºtzow as the latter ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic. Several Bristol Beaufort aircraft spotted L√ºtzow and her escorts off the Norwegian coast and one managed to surprise them and torpedo the cruiser early on the morning of 13 June, forcing her to return to Germany for repairs. Z23 was transferred to Brest, France, on the 16th, together with her sister Z24, and they helped to escort the battleship through the Bay of Biscay on 20‚Äì24 July and covered the passage of the merchant raider through the bay on 21‚Äì28 August. They were ordered to northern Norway on 23 October.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 24, 102; Rohwer, p. 78, 110; Whitley, pp. 116, 122‚Äì24 At the end of November the sisters reached Troms√∏ and was assigned to the 8. Zerst√∂rerflottile (8th Destroyer Flotilla), commanded by Kapit√§n zur See (Captain) Hans Erdmenger. On 17 December, Z23, along with her sisters Z24, Z25, and Z27, sortied into the Barents Sea on 16 December 1941, searching for Allied ships off the coast of the Kola Peninsula. The following day, Z25s radar spotted two ships in heavy fog at a range of . The Germans thought that they were Soviet destroyers, but they were actually two British minesweepers, and , sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them, but the heavy fog and icing precluded accurate gunfire. The British ships were able to escape despite four hits on Speedy and the heavy expenditure of ammunition. On 13 January 1942, Z25 escorted Z23 and Z24 as they laid a minefield in the western channel of the White Sea. A week later, Z23 accidentally rammed Z24 in heavy fog on 20 January, forcing the latter to return to Weserm√ºnde and the former to sail to Trondheim for repairs and a lengthy refit that lasted until August.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 102, 104; Rohwer, pp. 127, 135; Whitley, pp. 131‚Äì32 After escorting the minelayer to Narvik, she participated in Operation Zarin, a minelaying mission off the island of Novaya Zemlya from 24 to 28 September, together with Admiral Hipper, and her sisters , , and . On 23‚Äì24 October, the ship escorted the battleship and Admiral Scheer from Bogen Bay to Trondheim and continued to Copenhagen, Denmark, with Admiral Scheer, before returning to the Altafjord with the light cruiser . Engine problems prevented her from participating in Operation Regenbogen, an attack on Convoy JW 51B, at the end of the year.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 102‚Äì03; Rohwer, pp. 195, 197; Whitley, p. 142 On 5 March 1943, the 8. Zerst√∂rerflottile (Z23, Z24, and ) was transferred via the English channel to the French Atlantic coast in Operation Karin. Despite attacks by British coastal artillery and motor torpedo boats, the flotilla managed to pass through the Straits of Dover unscathed, but Z37 ran aground at Le Havre en route. The flotilla provided distant cover for an attempt by the Italian blockade runner Himalaya to sail for the Far East on 28 March, but the ship had to return to Bordeaux after it was spotted by a British reconnaissance aircraft. Two days later, the flotilla escorted the Italian blockade runner Pietro Orseolo through the Bay of Biscay despite the ship being torpedoed by an American submarine and under heavy attack by Bristol Beaufighter fighter- bombers and Beaufort torpedo bombers; the German destroyers shot down five of the attacking aircraft. Himalaya made another attempt to break out on 9 April, but the ships were spotted by a Short Sunderland flying boat. After reversing course, they were attacked by Vickers Wellington bombers and Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers. Five of the attackers were shot down, but Z23 suffered 5 dead and 31 wounded during the battle. The flotilla escorted submarines through the bay for the rest of the summer. On 24‚Äì26 December, the ship was one of the escorts for the blockade runner through the Bay of Biscay. During the mission, heavy seas flooded her forecastle and she lost four men overboard before returning to Bordeaux.Koop & Schmolke, p. 103; Rohwer, pp. 236, 241, 256, 294; Whitley, pp. 145‚Äì46, 148 =Battle of the Bay of Biscay= Another blockade runner, the refrigerated cargo ship , trailed Osorno by several days and four destroyers, including Z23, of the 8. Flotille and six torpedo boats of the 4. Torpedobootflotille (4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla) set sail on 27 December to escort her through the bay. The Allies were aware of these blockade runners through their Ultra code-breaking efforts and positioned cruisers and aircraft in the Western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. A Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber from No. 311 Squadron RAF sank Alsterufer later that afternoon.Rohwer, p. 295; Whitley, p. 149 The German ships were unaware of the sinking until the following afternoon and continued onward to the rendezvous point. They had been spotted by an American Liberator bomber on the morning of the 28th and the British light cruisers and , which were assigned to Stonewall, maneuvered to intercept them. By this time, the weather had gotten significantly worse and the German ships were steaming for home, hampered by the rough seas that threw spray over their forward guns that made them very hard to work. In addition the spray severely reduced visibility and hampered the rangefinders and sights for the guns and torpedoes. Using her radar, Glasgow was the first to open fire at the closest German ships, Z23 and Z27, at 13:46 at a range of with Enterprise following a few minutes later. Z23 fired six torpedoes once the range closed to , but they all missed. About that time, the destroyers began firing back. At 14:18 Erdmenger decided to split his forces and ordered Z23, Z27, and three torpedo boats to reverse course to the north. Z23 fired another torpedo, which also missed, five minutes later. The cruisers pursued the northern group and a hit in Z27s forward boiler room disabled one of her turbines and gradually reduced her speed. Glasgow and Enterprise concentrated their fire on the three torpedo boats after they turned south again at 14:39, sinking two of the torpedo boats. Z23 attempted to come to the drifting Z27s aid, but was ordered to disengage when Enterprise appeared. The torpedo boat joined up with Z23 and the two ships reached Saint-Jean-de-Luz, close to the Spanish border, later that day.Koop & Schmolke, p. 103; Rohwer, p. 295; Whitley, pp. 149‚Äì153 On 30 January 1944, Z23 was carrying out exercises in the south of the Bay of Biscay with Z32 and Z37 when the former collided with Z37. The impact detonated a torpedo warhead, knocked out both turbines and started a large fire amidships. Z23 towed her to Bordeaux where she was deemed a constructive total loss. The ship resumed escorting uboats through the bay, but was docked at La Pallice when she was attacked by 14 Avro Lancaster heavy bombers on 12 August. One bomb penetrated through the forward boiler room, detonating on the harbor bottom, and another landed near by. The ship began to flood and took on a list to port unable to use her pumps until she was connected to shore power. Z23 was also deemed a constructive total loss and she was decommissioned on 20 August with all of her equipment destroyed that could not be salvaged. The French Navy refloated the ship in 1945 and towed the ship to Cherbourg in two years later to use her for spares. She was condemned on 7 October 1951 and subsequently scrapped.Gr√∂ner, p. 204; Koop & Schmolke, p. 103; Rohwer, pp. 311‚Äì12; Whitley, pp. 163, 206 Notes References  * External links * Kriegsmarine destroyers 1939 ships Ships built in Bremen (state) Type 1936A-class destroyers Maritime incidents in August 1944 Scuttled vessels ","title":"German destroyer Z23"},{"id":"31561929","text":"The Avant is a mixed use tower located in Buffalo, New York.

Today, her Violence Prevention Curriculum for Adolescents is used in schools in all fifty states and abroad. Shortly after her residency, she took a teaching position at Boston University School of Medicine and became a staff physician at Boston City Hospital. She began to devote clinical hours in the Adolescent Clinic of the Harvard Street Neighborhood Health Center in Dorchester, a low-income section of Boston. From 1982 to 1996 (taking a sabbatical from 1987 to 1990), she treated teenagers for everything from sore throats to pregnancies, drug abuse and suicide attempts. In 1987, Governor Michael Dukakis appointed her as the first woman Commissioner of Public Health for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the Massachusetts Department of Public Health). During her term as Commissioner, she established the first Office of Violence Prevention in a state department of public health, expanded prevention programs for HIV/AIDS and increased drug treatment and rehabilitation programs. Faculty, Harvard School of Public Health In 1991, she published Deadly Consequences: How Violence Is Destroying Our Teenage Population and a Plan to Begin Solving the Problem, which was the first literary work to present violence from a public health perspective to a mass audience. In 1995, President Bill Clinton appointed her to the National Commission on Crime Control and Prevention.Changing the Face of Medicine Some publications  Prothrow-Stith, D., et al.

This legislation may be national or sub-national and is commonly aimed at ending bullying in schools or workplaces. According to one study, state-level anti-bullying legislation in the United States was associated with reductions in bullying, depression and suicidal ideation. The large impacts were observed for female teenagers and LGBT teenagers. For female teenagers, the suicide rate declined by 13-16%. Asia =Philippines= The Republic Act 10627 or the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013 was signed into law by former President Benigno Aquino III on September 6, 2013. The law requires all elementary and secondary schools in the country to adopt an anti-bullying policy. According to a study conducted in 2008 by the Britain-based Plan International, 50 percent of school children in the Philippines experienced bullying either by their teachers or their peers. North America =Canada= This law occurred in 2012. The provincial government of Quebec initiated legislation providing for anti-bullying laws, with the Quebec law having come into effect in 2012. In 2012, Ontario and Alberta also implement anti-bullying laws. The Workplace Bullying: A Global Health and Safety Issue Ellen Pinkos Cobb, Esq. Senior Regulatory & Legal Analyst The Isosceles Group Boston, MA United States of America, July 2012 Federal politicians also debated the groundwork for a national anti-bullying strategy the same year. =United States= History All fifty states in the United States have passed school anti-bullying legislation, the first being Georgia in 1999. Montana became the most recent, and last, state to adopt anti-bullying legislation in April 2015. A watchdog organization called Bully Police USA advocates for and reports on anti-bullying legislation. North Dakota's legislature passed and Gov. Jack Dalrymple signed a bill into law April 22, 2011, which defines bullying in state law and outlines prevention policies for North Dakota public schools. North Dakota has been praised for their new law. Prior to its passage, North Dakota has passed an anti-bullying legislation. Georgia's anti-bullying legislation was strengthened in 2010 with the passage of Senate Bill 250, which included a provision allowing for those accused of bullying another student to be reassigned to another school in order to separate the offender from the victim of bullying. The Safe and Drug- Free Schools and Communities Act is part of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. It provides federal support to promote school safety but does not specifically address bullying and harassment in schools. There are no federal laws dealing directly with school bullying; however, bullying may trigger responsibilities under one or more of the federal anti-discrimination laws enforced by the United States Department of Education‚Äôs Office for Civil Rights. Starting in September 2011, the State of New Jersey will enforce the toughest bullying law in the country. Each school will have to report each case of bullying to the State, and the State will grade each school based on bullying standards, policies, and incidents. Each school must have an effective plan to deal with bullying. All school administrators and teachers are required to deal with any incidents of bullying reported to them or witnessed by them. Teachers must report any bullying incidents they witness to the administrators. Bullies risk suspensions to expulsions if convicted of any type of bullying; from minor teasing to severe cases. Civil rights activist and world-renowned anti-bullying expert Christina Catalano has stated that \\"[bullied individuals] can suffer from various issues such as the lack of confidence, problems in academics, social anxiety and the fear of public speaking.\\" https://riseantibullying.org/our-founder-story In addition, prominent legal scholar Jonathan Burley has stated \\"bullying is an extremely serious injustice towards our children\\" and has been a consistent advocate of anti-bullying legislation.\\"Bullying's Day in Court\\", USA Today, July 15, 2008 Others have been more critical of this legislation for being punitive and criminalizing the issue. Although there currently exists no federal assistance for anti-bullying, Thursday's ChildThursday's Child offers a 24-hour helpline for children, teens and young adults in the U.S., who are bullying victims, at 1 (800) USA KIDS or (818) 831-1234 from a mobile device. Currently, it is the only such helpline in North America. Controversy The National School Safety and Security Services questions the motive behind some anti-bullying legislation. The line between ‚Äúfeel-good legislation‚Äù and ‚Äúmeaningful legislation‚Äù is not clear at the moment and The National School Safety and Security Services suggests ‚Äúunfunded state mandates and an overemphasis on any one component of school safety will likely have minimal impact on school safety and could potentially upset the comprehensive approach to school safe recommended by most school safety professionals‚Äù According to National Safety and Securities Services ‚ÄúAnti-bullying legislation, typically an unfunded mandate requiring schools to have anti-bullying policies but providing no financial resources to improve school climate and security, offer more political hype than substance for helping school administrators address the problem. Gail Garinger, Child Advocate for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, advises legislators not to push new legislation each time the media highlights a new bullying incident, saying, \\"Maybe a new law is needed in your state to deal with a situation, but don‚Äôt rush to do it. Sit down. Really talk about what happened.\\" She adds, \\"I think school officials have gotten really frightened because of what‚Äôs been occurring, and it‚Äôs much easier to take a zero-tolerance approach and just label everything quickly as bullying and pass it on to someone else to deal with, rather than try to work out a creative solution within the school that‚Äôs best for everyone involved.\\" LGBTQ bullying thumb400pxSome states of the United States have implemented laws to address school bullying.   Anti-bullying legislation received national attention after the suicide of Rutgers University student Tyler Clementi. In the wake of the incident, New Jersey strengthened its anti- bullying legislation by passing a bill called ‚ÄúThe Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights.‚Äù Garden State Equality Chairman Steve Goldstein called New Jersey's bill the \\"toughest\\" anti-bullying law in the country. The bill states administrators who do not investigate reports of bullying can be disciplined. Various organizations provide resources and support to gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth. These organizations include The Trevor Project, The Tyler Clementi Foundation, It Gets Better Project, and The Matthew Shepard Foundation. Cyberbullying According to the Cyberbullying Research Center, about 20 percent of children age 11-18 have been victims of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is defined as ‚Äúwillful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices.‚Äù Cyberbullying can occur 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In August 2008, the California State Legislature passed a law directly related with cyber-bullying. The legislation gives school administrators the authority to discipline students for bullying others offline or online. Many states already have existing criminal and civil remedies to deal with cyberbullying; extreme cases would fall under criminal harassment or stalking laws or targets of such extreme bullying could pursue civil action for intentional infliction of emotional distress or defamation. In the summer of 2011, Public Act 11-232 made significant changes to the state of Connecticut statute which defines bullying as the following: (A) The repeated use by one or more students of a written, oral or electronic communication, such as cyberbullying, directed at or referring to another student attending school in the same school district, or (B) a physical act or gesture by one or more students repeatedly directed at another student attending school in the same school district, that (i) causes physical or emotional harm to himself or herself, or of damage to his or her property, (ii) places such student in reasonable fear of harm to himself or herself, or of damage to his or her property, (iii) creates a hostile environment at school for such student, (iv) infringes on the rights of such student at school, or (v) substantially disrupts the education process or the orderly operation of a school Beyond this, bullying includes, but is not limited to ‚Äúa written, oral or electronic communication or physical act or gesture-based on any actual or perceived differentiating characteristic, such as race, color, religion ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, socioeconomic status, academic status, physical appearance, or mental, physical, developmental or sensory disability, or by association with an individual or group who has or is perceived to have one or more of such characteristics.\\" (Connecticut Department of Education) Effective 1 December 2012, North Carolina has made it a crime for students to bully their teachers. Students can face jail time and/or a $1,000 fine for cyberbullying school employees. Prohibited conduct includes posting a photo of a teacher on the internet, making a fake website, signing a teacher up for junk mail. South America =Chile= On September 7, 2011, Chile's Congress approved \\"The Law about School Violence\\" that amended the General Law on Education to establish clear definitions, procedures, and penalties for school violence and bullying.Ley 20.536 Sobre Violencia Escolar The Law defines bullying as any repeated aggression or harassment that occurs in or outside the educational institution, by one student or a group towards another, causing mistreatment, humiliation, or fear. Bullying may be perpetrated in person or through any means, including cyber-bullying. Educational institutions are required to create a Committee of Good School Coexistence (Comit√© de Buena Convivencia Escolar) that will be in charge of managing and taking all the measures needed to secure a non-violent school life.Chile: Congress Approves Draft Legislation to Combat Bullying in Schools Europe =Austria= In Austria, laws impose a legal duty of care on teachers to ensure the safety and well-being of their students. Thus, teachers have both a professional and moral obligation to intervene in bullying episodes. =United Kingdom= Section 89 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 provides for state schools for 'Determination by headteacher of behavior policy' (1)The headteacher of a relevant school must determine measures to be taken with a view to‚Äî (a)promoting, among pupils, self-discipline and proper regard for authority, (b)encouraging good behavior and respect for others on the part of pupils and, in particular, preventing all forms of bullying among pupils, (c)securing that the standard of behavior of pupils is acceptable, (d)securing that pupils complete any tasks reasonably assigned to them in connection with their education, and (e)otherwise regulating the conduct of pupils. (2)The headteacher must in determining such measures‚Äî (a)act in accordance with the current statement made by the governing body under section 88(2)(a), and (b)have regard to any notification or guidance given to him under section 88(2)(b). (3)The standard of behavior which is to be regarded as acceptable must be determined by the headteacher, so far as it is not determined by the governing body. (4)The measures which the headteacher determines under subsection (1) must include the making of rules and provision for disciplinary penalties (as defined by section 90). (5)The measures which the headteacher determines under subsection (1) may, to such extent as is reasonable, include measures to be taken with a view to regulating the conduct of pupils at a time when they are not on the premises of the school and are not under the lawful control or charge of a member of the staff of the school. (6)The measures determined by the headteacher under subsection (1) must be publicized by him in the form of a written document as follows‚Äî (a)he must make the measures generally known within the school and to parents of registered pupils at the school, and (b)he must, in particular, at least once in every school year, take steps to bring them to the attention of all such pupils and parents and all persons who work at the school (whether or not for payment).

Military service  Balabio was born in Milan on 14 April 1759 to a rich banking family. He studied first at Monza and then at Pavia, where he obtained a law degree. Initially beginning as a criminal lawyer, he was persuaded by his family to enter commerce and worked in business with the Commissioner of the Austrian Army in Italy. Forced out of business by the French invasion of 1796 he then entered military service as a commander of a detachment of cavalry, armed at his own expense with what remained of his fortune. In less than four months he was promoted Captain and then Caposquadrone. By the beginning of the War of the Second Coalition in 1799 he was an officer in the Cisalpine Republic acting as Aide de Camp (ADC) to Jean Victor Marie Moreau, then Barth√©lemy Catherine Joubert during the campaign in Northern Italy. After Joubert's death at the catastrophic Battle of Novi, Balabio fled with his troops and joined the forces under Andr√© Mass√©na, distinguishing himself as ADC during the Siege of Genoa 1800, for which he was promoted Colonel. In 1805, he commanded the 2nd Hussar Regiment (2.o reggimento Ussari Cisalpino) in the Kingdom of Italy and Guides as part of Domenico Pino's Division during the planned invasion of England in France. He took part in the campaign in Germany against Karl Mack von Leiberich that led to the Battle of Ulm, before returning to Italy. Based in Cremona, his regiment of hussars was converted to dragoons, taking the name Dragoni Napoleone (Napoleon's Dragoons), and the other regiment (the 1st), commanded by Colonel Pietro Luigi Viani, was simultaneously converted to dragoons and named \\"della Regina\\". In 1806, his regiment served under Massena in the conquest of Naples. Promoted Brigadier General, he was appointed commander of the cavalry division under Pino in 1807 and moved to Pomerania to face the troops of King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. In 1808, he commanded the Italian Cavalry brigade attached to Pino's Division as part of Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr's VII Corps in Spain, and saw action at the Siege of Gerona, and the actions at Hostalrich on 15 December and Cardadeu on 16 December. In February 1809, he served at the Battle of Valls. Unable to continue in active service, he was replaced by Giuseppe Federico Palombini in 1809 and made Deposito Generale in the Department of Lodi. On 23 November 1811, Balabio was appointed Inspector General of the cavalry. Following the virtual destruction of the mounted arm of the Kingdom of Italy in 1812, Balabio had the task of reforming the remnants for the 1813 campaign. At the end of the war he was stationed in Mantua, after the peace he retired as Major General. Balabio was married to Teresa Berra. Their daughter Maria Balabio was married to a Russian general Danil Andreyevich Boyko. Balabio died in Milan, almost in poverty, on 8 August 1838.La Cavalleria di Linea Italica p.5G.

Background =History= Legend attributes the creation of Japan to a sun goddess from whom the original emperors are said to be descended beginning in 660 BC. Japan was, for the next one thousand years, a largely heterogeneous culture with diverse regional social patterns. Contact with Korea and China during this time brought aspects of both cultures to Japan, including rules of rank and etiquette, the Chinese calendar, astronomy, and a healing system based on traditional Chinese medicine. Military dictators, or sh≈çguns, ruled for roughly the next seven hundred years, culminating in military reunification, and widespread implementation of civil order consistent with the ethos of the samurai class, e.g. rules of loyalty, social hierarchy, and filial piety. Western attempts at trade with Japan were largely unsuccessful until 1853 when an American fleet led by Commodore Perry arrived in Japanese waters and forced Japan into unfavorable trading agreements. This event coincided with the fall of the sh≈çguns and the subsequent Meiji restoration that ended a system of feudal landholders, and helped unify the nation. Japan quickly transitioned to a modern power with an imperial army. Japan then began to extend its empire and seize various Pacific islands and parts of Russia. This militarism carried over to the 1920s when Japan invaded China, to the 1930s when Japan joined the Axis powers, and finally into the 1940s when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. In 1945, the historic drop of two atomic bombs by the US on Hiroshima and Nagasaki resulted in the disastrous outcomes that ultimately forced retreat. The US then occupied Japan from 1945 to 1952 under General Douglas MacArthur. A new constitution took effect in 1947 according to which the emperor became largely a symbolic head of state. Japan regained its sovereignty in 1952, and in 1972 the US gave back some islands, the Ryukyu, that included Okinawa. Japan's economic growth was swift, relying on new technologies, manufacturing and a protectionist attitude. In 1998, Japan ‚Äì like much of the region ‚Äì suffered the worst recession since World War II, which led eventually to the resignation of the prime minister. Since then the economy has improved, but is still plagued by stagnation, a fact that the recent 23-foot tsunami and the largest earthquake in Japanese history that struck on March 11, 2011 did not help. A tsunami triggered by a huge earthquake in 2011 stuck the nuclear power plant (NPP) in Fukushima and lead to the leakage of harmful radioactive materials, such as 131I, 137Cs, and 134Cs, into the environment. As a result, more than 170,000 people in Japan evacuated from the area at the time. The radioactive materials from Fukushima incident were released into the air and water, possibly polluting agriculture and marine life in Japan and other nearby countries. =Social structure and organization= The population of Japan in 2009 was 127.51 million. It is the tenth largest population in the world with the fifth highest population density. The country is increasingly urban. About 45% of the population was, in 2005, centered within 50 kilometers of the three largest cities in Japan: Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. (2011). Statistics Bureau, Japan. Retrieved from www.stat.go.jp/english/data/handbook/c02cont.html In 2005, 20.1% of the population was over 65 years old. This figure is projected to increase to 31.8% by 2030, higher than any other industrialized nation. The fertility rate, at 1.21, is below the replacement level.Central Intelligence Agency. (2011). Japan: The World Factbook. Retrieved April 15, 2011. The percent of three-generational households has steadily declined since the 1970s while the proportion of one-person and nuclear households has increased steadily in the same time period. Social interactions in Japan are traditionally guided by the opposing dynamics of intimacy and hierarchy. In social situations, a commitment to group harmony, solidarity and intimacy must be balanced by deep respect for hierarchy. Rules of hierarchy are guided by age, social status and type of employment. Appropriate behavior therefore depends on a person's ability to assess the relative hierarchical distinction between individuals. Distance naturally decreases intimacy, and appropriate language must be used to communicate deference and avoid offending the other party. Traditionally, any behavior that fosters conflict or suggests deviance is not acceptable in Japan. =Political and economic system= Since its constitution was adopted in 1947, Japan has been a parliamentary government with a constitutional monarchy. The monarchy is hereditary while the prime minister must be elected by the Diet, or a bicameral legislative branch consisting of the House of Councilors and House of Representatives. Japanese local administration is by prefecture. The country is divided into 47 prefectures, each of which is further subdivided into cities with respective wards and blocks. Suffrage is granted at age 20 Japan boasts the fourth largest GDP in the world after the European Union, the United States, and China. While Japan was for centuries a largely agricultural economy, the percentage of the total labor force shifted dramatically in the twentieth century from agriculture to industrial occupations. Consequently, Japan must import about 60% of its food. Japan is one of the world's largest, most technologically sophisticated producers of automobiles, electronic equipment (including digital cameras), machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemicals, textiles, and processed foods. The unemployment rate is stable at less than 5%. Nevertheless, the economy is challenged by Japan's huge government department, exceeding 200% of the GDP, unrelenting deflation, reliance on exports, and graying, diminishing population. A classic \\"M-shaped curve\\" notably marks female employment as many women drop out of the labor force to raise children. Three times as many women are employed part-time as men. The Japan Council for Quality Health Care administers the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy, a no- fault compensation system for the care of delivery-related cerebral palsy. =Religion= Religion, as practiced in Japan today, includes Shintoism (83.9%), Buddhism (71.4%), Christianity (2%), and other (7.8%). Total adherence exceeds 100% because many identify with both Shintoism and Buddhism. Shinto shrines, honoring gods and goddesses of ancient Japanese mythology, decorate the landscape of Japan. Shintoism is based on earlier animistic and shamanistic traditions, and contains many concepts crucial to daily Japanese life today including cleanliness of the body and home. Shintoism was for a long time considered the \\"people's religion\\" while Buddhism was adopted originally by the elite. Fundamental to Zen Buddhism are values such as personal effort, personal sacrifice, dedication, exertion, attunement to the body as well as meditation centered upon daily activities such as tea drinking, flower arrangement, and gardening. Confucian philosophical traditions, while not specifically religious, are also embedded within Japanese culture. The five essential relationships according to this philosophy are father-son, ruler-son, husband-wife, older brother-younger brother, and between friends. Clearly this system leaves out woman-centered relationships (e.g. mother-daughter). =Physical environment= Japan is a country of islands with Korea to the west, China to the southwest, and Russia to the north. Most of the population lives on the four main islands located between the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan. These islands are called Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. The entire land mass of Japan is slightly smaller than California, but the climate varies dramatically from cool and temperate in the north to tropical in the south. This mostly mountainous country is, based on its location, vulnerable to a variety of natural hazards including volcanoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and typhoons. =Health and illness theories= Japan's primary medical system is biomedicine. In the late 1800s, the Japanese government formally adopted the German system of medical training and medical care delivery. This system of health care exists side by side with a uniquely Japanese system of healing called Kampo The government granted Kampo official status in the 1950s, a landmark event which came with both government regulation as well as national insurance coverage for certain types of treatment. Kampo is centered on establishing balance of physical, mental, social, and emotional states. An imbalance may be due to changes such as heat (e.g. overactivity), poor diet, dampness, or pathogens. Balance and imbalance are understood according to three main sets of contrasting states: hot/cold, excess/deficiency, and internal/external. A practitioner of Kampo gathers extensive personal information about physical and emotional experience and focuses on restoring balance. Treatments include moxibustion and acupuncture. Kampo treatment is generally considered appropriate for chronic conditions, when multiple organs are affected (e.g. immune disorders or age-related decline), or when biomedicine cannot diagnose or effectively treat a condition. =Women's health statistics= While the social status of women is relatively low, the status of mother is very high in Japan. The concept of (good wife and wise mother), while contributing to the positive perception of and respect for the mothering role, has been the focus of some resistance by women in the past 25 years. The mean childbearing age is 29.7, an approximately four-year increase since 1979. Mean age of first marriage is 28.6 for women, representing an over five-year increase since 1950. Marriage rates have decreased since 1970; divorce rates, while remaining low, have slightly increased since 1970. Nevertheless, most women in Japan still have one or two children and devote enormous amounts of time and energy into raising them. Citizenship is notably guarded: a child born in Japan does not receive Japanese nationality if both parents are non-Japanese, or if a Japanese father denies paternity of a child born to a non-Japanese woman. The availability of the birth control pill in Japan is a highly contentious issue due to the government's concern for its many potentially negative systemic side effects and worry that it may contribute, through lack of condom use, to a rise of HIV. While the pill is now available, usage continues to be lower than many other countries. A 2001 survey of 1500 women, for example, found that only 4% of Japanese women use this method compared to 87% in the US and 93% in Germany. Abortion has been legal in Japan since 1948. A 1982 survey by the Kyodo News Service reported than 75% of women in their fifties had undergone abortions at some point in their lives. Abortion became legal during the postwar period when the needs of survival limited the number of mouths a family could feed. Nevertheless, abortion is not taken lightly and is traditionally marked by various Buddhist rituals in which parents express regret and gratitude to their aborted children for their sacrifice for the family. A 2005 study by Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine reported that there were 341,588 induced abortions in 2001. In addition, the abortion rate has been gradually increased by 5.4% to 292 per 1,000 live births from 1998 to 2001. Women's health related figures in Japan are inspiringly positive. Japan boasts one of the longest life expectancies for women in the world at 82.25 years. According to WHO statistics, life expectancy rate were 83 for both sexes and 86 for women in 2011.World health statistics 2013. (2013). S.l.: World Health Organization. And the infant mortality rate is 2.78 deaths per 1,000 live births, one of the lowest in the world. Whether these two facts are related to a final figure, the 2011 estimate of fertility rate of just 1.21 children, is as yet undetermined. Infant mortality rate has decreased to 2.13 per 1,000 live births in 2014. Maternal mortality rate is 5 deaths per 100,000 live births, one of the lowest in the world Pregnancy behaviors and beliefs =Prenatal care= The vast majority (or, approximately 99%) of women who carry pregnancies to term in Japan are married. The majority of these women stop working once they become pregnant. Japanese women are required by the Maternal Child Health Act to register their pregnancies with the local government, and encouraged to be vigilant of their pregnancy by utilizing the Maternal and Child Health Handbook (boshi techo) distributed upon registration. Over 90% of pregnancies are registered before the 20th week of gestation, suggesting that most women are visiting a doctor and receiving support from public health services. Japanese women are advised to have prenatal visits every 4 weeks through 23 weeks gestation, every 2 weeks from 24 to 35 weeks, and every week after 36 weeks, for a total of 14 prenatal visit for a low to medium risk pregnancy. Ultrasound is used routinely to monitor the development of the fetus; most women have at least five fetal ultrasound exams during their pregnancy, a heavy use of technology considered necessary to assure a healthy baby and safe birth. Pregnant women in Japan have a strong belief related to ultrasonography. As a result, most pregnant women in Japan often receive fetal sonogram in every prenatal visit. They believe that monitoring normal development of the fetus will facilitate safe delivery. Additionally, because Japanese women prioritize safe delivery, episiotomy is often performed in all birth cases. Screenings for domestic violence and maternal depression are not often conducted during prenatal visits in Japan, while in the US 35% of women are screened for domestic violence and 47% for maternal depression. Genetic screening tests, such as amniocentesis, are available in Japan but rarely used. Contrary to US culture, the idea of having a \\"normal\\" or \\"abnormal\\" fetus is not as much a part of the traditional Japanese conception of pregnancy. Rather, the Japanese paradigm sees a fetus as inherently a work in progress, or \\"perfectible.\\" Ob-gyns rarely initiate open discussion of the possibility of undergoing amniocentesis or triple marker tests with pregnant patients. In fact, the Health Ministry issued guidelines in 1999 according to which ob-gyns have no obligation to inform patients of these tests. Having an abortion due to fetal abnormalities is very rare. Some theorize that the reason for this is because the role of mother is so highly valued, while others suggest that women, freed from the pressure of holding down a job during motherhood, are less daunted by the time required to care for a child with additional needs. =Local conceptualization of pregnancy= Pregnancy is considered a period of mental and physical discipline for women, a process during which women literally make their babies. The outcome of a pregnancy is deeply tied to a woman's conduct; women are considered responsible for minimizing miscarriage and premature birth. There are many theories as to why this may be. Primary to understanding this idea is the Japanese principle of ganbaru, a fundamental notion that can be traced to many aspects of Japanese lifestyle. It means a general ability to \\"try as hard as possible at whatever one does.\\" For example, women are often reprimanded by their doctors to try harder if they are gaining what is considered too much weight (e.g. no more than 22 pounds is recommended, while some doctors advise less). If a pregnant Japanese woman is gaining too much weight, she may be instructed to weigh herself daily until she meets the goals set by her ob-gyn. Men are considered to be far removed from pregnancy because it isn't occurring in their bodies; they are therefore often exempt from maternity courses, medical visits, as well as sometimes the birth event itself. =Preparation for birth= During the fifth month of pregnancy (which is the American fourth month because, in Japan, months are counted as having four weeks while in the USA some months are 4 and some 5) women often go with a mother or grandmother to a shrine that is dedicated to safe childbirth. Here the women pray for a safe childbirth and purchase a special pregnancy sash, or obi to wrap around the abdomen of the pregnant woman. This sash is meant to protect the uterus from the cold, keep the fetus stable and prevent it from growing too large. The ritual also aids in creating maternal identity. =Extrinsic factors= Food Environment, or kankyo, is also a key concept in the Japanese theory of gestation. This idea surpasses the Western concept of what you feed yourself you feed your baby by encompassing ideas about certain foods being related to coldness or heat. Sweets, for example, are considered a cold food that should be avoided in pregnancy as the womb is meant to be warm. Also promoted is the idea that a pregnant woman should eat foods native to Japan. The concept moto ni modoru in this context suggests that in regard to food, one should go back to the origin when pregnant. In other words, Japanese babies are made of Japanese food which comes from Japanese soil. Traditional thoughts about proper food to eat in pregnancy relate to the idea that women are not just vessels, but active vehicles working toward creation. Emotional behavior Emphasis is also made in prenatal care on keeping a tranquil heart, limiting stress, and trying to elevate your spirits, becoming spiritual (even if you're usually not), and stroking the baby from time to time. This concept of mental wellbeing is called shinkyo and many doctors will be more lax on nutrition if they feel the food pressure is stressing out a woman and putting her spirit in danger. Sexual activity Topics not typically covered with the physician during prenatal visits for which Japanese women may turn to popular magazines include: sex during pregnancy, information regarding the birth experiences other women, unusual methods for delivery, as well as explanations of many medical terms. Rest, activity, and movement or personal behavior Stress and physical difficulty are considered harmful to the healthy development of pregnancy. Work is considered one of the many environmental factors women are supposed to control. The Maternal and Child Health handbook details for women acceptable \\"postures for physical activity in daily life.\\" They are also instructed in this book to keep their bodies warm at all times, stabilize their bellies, and protect themselves against bumps. Labor =Location= Satogaeri shussan, or going back home, is a traditional custom in Japan according to which pregnant women return to their natal homes for labor and childbirth. This tradition, though waning in contemporary Japan, reinforces family ties and also reflects the practical needs of the mother to be. Often a woman will switch doctors at this time. It is more common today for a mother to stay at home and have her mothers, sister, or mother-in-law come to look after her, especially in the case of a second pregnancy, than to go to her parents' house. Additionally, the most recent change introduced new medical procedures, change in birth attendants, and change in birthplace. =Extrinsic factors= Food and drink Eating and drinking during labor are usually encouraged by medical providers in Japan. Japanese women tend to eat voraciously in labor, which counters common practice in American hospitals. Eating is encouraged, especially by midwives, so that the laboring woman will have energy to push. Movement, activity, and emotional behavior Walking is encouraged during labor by most medical providers in Japan. But making loud sounds is not considered acceptable during labor. =Pain= In Japan, primary and secondary level maternity hospitals and clinics do not use epidurals. Most Japanese women alleviate pain in others ways such as breathing, movement, and massage/acupressure. Many Japanese women believe that the mother child bond is strengthened through labor. Others fear that pain medication will make the fetus weak and unhealthy. Some Japanese women who do not use pain medication for the first labor decide to use it in subsequent births. =Attendants during labor and supportive behavior= Female relatives traditionally help Japanese woman through labor. While men traditionally do not help in labor, one recent 2011 cohort study revealed that about half of Japanese women now have their husbands in the laboring room. Massage, stroking, and acupressure by female relatives are commonly utilized techniques to help a woman in Japan through labor. Birth =Birth attendant and assistants= Births in Japan are attended by either licensed doctors or experienced midwives. Childbirth in Japan underwent three significant changes. During the Edo era, from 17th to 19th centuries, birth attendant had been an officially recognized as a profession in Japan. In the beginning of the 19th century however, traditional birth attendants were replaced by modern birth attendants also known as ‚Äúkindai-sanba‚Äù. While statistics suggest that only 2.8% of births in Japan are attended by midwives, it is estimated that closer to half of all births in Japan are midwife- attended. The discrepancy is likely because of a legal provision that doctors must sign his or her name when both a doctor and midwife are present at birth. In actuality, it is a frequent occurrence in hospitals that a midwife attends an entire labor and birth, and a doctor is only called in at the final pushing stage. Professional midwives had a national midwifery association in Japan from 1927 until it was dissolved by U.S. occupying forces after WWII. Since 1948, the education system for midwives was combined with nursing education, both of which require three years of training. The word for midwife also changed after 1947. The original word sanba (san meaning birth and ba meaning old women) was changed to josan-pu (josan meaning help delivery, and pu meaning woman). And in 2002 it was changed again to josan-shi (josan meaning help and shi meaning teacher) to avoid gender connotations. Traditionally, midwives in Japan continuously share strong relationships with the families of the baby they delivered. Because Japanese people believe that babies are transferred to humans by god and that midwives are people who facilitate the process, midwives often stay as godmothers of babies that they help deliver. Moreover, midwives often continue to live in the community near their godchild babies for this religious reason. In 2006 there were 25,775 midwives in Japan: 88% worked in hospitals and clinics, 6% were independent, and 6% were employed by universities, and government institutions. Independent midwives attend birth in one of the 388 practicing maternity homes nationwide. In 2012, the number of midwives in Japan were 35,185: 62% worked at hospitals, 25% at clinics, and 13% at health centers, maternity homes, universities and others. Medical education in Japan lasts six years, and begins directly after high school. The first four years of training are considered preclinical, and the final two years are clinical. In 2006, there were 79 medical schools in Japan, and the students were 32.8% female. A recent law now requires training for an additional two years after graduation. The field of obstetrics in Japan differs from the US in the high value placed on normal physiologic birth, and in the concept of obstetrics as a field largely distinct from surgery. =Locus of decision making power= Doctors are often addressed as sensei in Japanese, significant because people with the title of sensei are typically not questioned. Other positions that share this title, e.g. teacher, professor, and priest are ‚Äì as keepers of knowledge ‚Äì traditionally obeyed. (Engel 1989) Patients who ask too many questions risk seeming offensive or irritating, and a good patient is a passive one. Consequently, mode of delivery is thought to be best decided by obstetricians, not by laboring women (Matsuoka & Hinokuma 2009) For example, requesting a cesarean without medical reason is perceived as unacceptable. The care provided by independent midwives at maternity homes or in home births is traditionally woman centered, the locus of decision-making power remains with the laboring woman. =Location of birth= In 2005, 51.5% of Japanese babies were born in hospitals, 47% in private physician-run clinics with fewer than nineteen beds, 1.0% in maternity homes, and 0.2% at home. =Birth position= Japanese women predominantly give birth in a semisitting position, though some literature suggest the lying down, lithotomy position, is still used. =Pain= Painkillers are thought to complicate deliveries and women are discouraged by ob-gyns from taking them during childbirth. Therefore, Japanese births tend to be without pain medication. Furthermore, there is a more positive image of a women capable of natural birth. Without pain medication, labor displays the woman's strength and responsibility. Some believe that not experiencing pain during birth hinders bonding between mother and baby. If a Japanese woman would like an epidural during labor, she must give birth at one of the few private and expensive hospitals that provide them. Pursuing this option is still relatively rare in Japan today. Many midwives practice perineal massage to promote stretching, ease birth, and minimize maternal trauma. =Extrinsic factors= Activity and movement In facing birth without pain medications, many supportive techniques are used such as breathing, position changes, movement, massage, stroking, and acupressure. Emotional behavior Japanese women are expected to experience labor and birth quietly, with an emphasis on breathing techniques. Screaming or shouting by a laboring or birthing women may be met with a request such as, \\"no voicing\\" from an attendant, and a refocus on breathing and remaining calm. =Behavior for complications= Obstetricians, especially the older generation still practicing, advocate for physiological births and discourage unnecessary interventions. If complications arise that demand cesareans, then cesareans are performed. However, cesarean birth has a negative image in Japan, and is often perceived as suggestive that a woman was incompetent or deficient. The rate of c-sections in Japan in 2005 was, according to one estimate, 17.4%. Other reports suggest the rate is as low as 10% in some locations; nevertheless, rates between 10% and 20% reported throughout Japan are significantly lower than North America. Of women attempting vaginal birth at a maternity home, about 10.2% are eventually transferred for complications to large hospitals with neonatal intensive care units. =Use of technology and other interventions= Use of a continuous fetal monitor is the norm in hospitals and physician-run clinics, but precisely when this is typically applied is hard to discern from existing literature. Episiotomies were in 1995 still common in Japan: in the hospital the rate for primiparas was 88% and 41% for multiparas. (Matsuoka & Hinokuma 2009) Maternity homes tend to use far less technology and interventions. For example, the rate of episiotomies in maternity homes for primiparas was 5% and for multiparas it was 1%.  Postpartum  =Time and place= Most women stay in the hospital for 4 to 7 days after vaginal delivery, and about 10 days after cesarean. This period is a time for ansei, or peace and quiet with pampering. Rest is considered very important; it is thought that the long recuperation after childbirth helps explain why Japanese women have less uterine disease and need fewer hysterectomies in middle age than American women. Some Japanese hospitals do not provide rooming in as it interferes with rest, while others do. Traditionally, Japanese women were expected to stay inside with their babies for the first 100 days after birth, but this is not expected in contemporary Japan. =Different behaviors for primiparous vs. multiparous women= While all Japanese women are encouraged to rest after birth, primiparous women need only focus on one child whereas multiparous women face additional childcare obligations. Therefore, while primiparous Japanese women traditionally return to their mother's home for about one month after leaving the hospital to be cared for and receive help with the care of the baby, it is more likely that female family members of a new mother will go to her house to help out if there are additionally children to watch. =Postpartum depression= One study of Japanese women done in 2005 found that the prevalence of maternity blues and postpartum depression was much less for women who gave birth in maternity homes than for those who delivered in hospitals. The authors attributed this difference to the idea that bodily damage and pain are experienced far less in Japanese maternity homes than hospitals. A study by Ikeda and Kamibeppu found that 20.4% of Japanese women have postpartum depression. Newborn =Vaccinations= Like most newborns in Western hospitals, infants are given a series of vaccines and screening procedures, and can be seen as rites of passage. In contemporary Japan, the baby is given a hepatitis B vaccine, and is screened for a variety of diseases, including phynylketonuria, and hypothyroid disease. This process is voluntary but there is about 99% compliance. Besides frequent health and developmental checks in clinics during the first year, special development checks are required by law for all children at 18 months of age, and again at age 3. =Caregiver= The mother is the primary caregiver in Japan. While fathers occasionally help with the baby, their main responsibility is to support their family. It is a traditional Japanese belief that contact and interaction between mother and newborn, or \\"skinship\\", during the first three years is one of the most important periods of the child's life. It builds the relationship between mother and child. Also, because childcare options are limited, working women often rely on their parents for assistance. In fact, 67.2% of working women with children under 1 turn to grandparents for childcare. While attitudes are changing, a survey in the early 1990s showed that 55.6% of women and 65.7% of men agreed that child care and other housework fall entirely in the woman's domain. =Umbilical cord= Japanese hospitals typically place part of the umbilical cord that falls off in a traditional box specifically designed for this purpose. When the mother leaves the hospital, the umbilical cord is given to her. This Japanese custom is based upon the belief that the umbilical cord has a direct relationship to the health of the baby. Maltreating it, therefore, risks causing harm or disease in the child. In some Japanese households, a mother may show a child the umbilical cord on certain events like birthdays to recall the day the child was born. In other households, the umbilical cord is given to a child on the day he or she leaves home or marries symbolize separation. Also, a preserved umbilical cord is considered to be a cure for the child when he or she is sick. Parents would cut a small portion of the cord and feed it to the child. Additionally, the Japanese believe that the umbilical cord is a symbol of the child's fate. So if one loses his or her umbilical cord, his/her spiritual fate is considered lost as well. =Extrinsic factors= Bathing Bathing the baby is the traditional role of the father, providing a means of \\"skinship\\". Food and drink Japanese women strongly believe in natural childbirth (Yeo et al. 2000). This includes eating natural and organic home-cooked meals. As a result, many pregnant women do not take prenatal vitamins or supplements. In the hospital, Japanese midwives perform daily breast massage to encourage milk production and flow. Women are encouraged to breastfeed their child on a set schedule. According to a 2006 study, 90% of women in Japan were breastfeeding exclusively at one week after birth compared to 51% of U.S. women. Breastfeeding is officially promoted, but artificial milk is also heavily advertised. (Engel 1989) Many women in Japan breastfeed, but when the baby is in a grandmother's care, for example, formula may be given. When a baby is 100 days old, Japanese families celebrate a weaning ceremony called or first food. This ceremony traditionally involves a large shared meal prepared by the mother-in-law. The menu varies by region. During the meal a symbolic stone is placed on plates. This ritual is meant to wish the baby a life of abundant food without hunger as well as good strong teeth. While a people may pretend to feed the baby solid food during these festivities, the baby is usually still drinking exclusive milk. Sleep In Japan, co-sleeping with newborns is very normal. Japanese babies traditionally sleep in the same room or near parents. Naming When a baby turns 7 days old, Japanese families celebrate Oshichiya („Åä‰∏ÉÂ§ú). In this ceremony, the baby is officially named. The mother, the father, and the grandparents are often involved in this process.

Completed in 1940, the ship spent the first half of the war in Norwegian waters. She was very active in attacking the Arctic convoys ferrying war materials to the Soviet Union in 1941‚Äì1942, but only helped to sink one Allied ship herself. After being rearmed in late 1942, Z24 was transferred to France where she spent 1943 escorting Axis blockade runners through the Bay of Biscay and played a minor role in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay at the end of the year. After the Allied landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944, she was one of the few remaining destroyers in French waters and was badly damaged during the Battle of Ushant several days later. After repairs had been completed in early August, the ship was damaged by Allied fighter-bombers in mid-August. Another attack later in the month by fighter- bombers sank Z24. Design and description Wartime Allied recognition manual drawing of the Type 36A destroyer The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936 class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a maximum draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by six Wagner water-tube boilers for a designed speed of . Z24 carried a maximum of of fuel oil which gave a range of at . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.Gr√∂ner, pp. 203‚Äì04 The ship carried four TbtsK C/36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, one forward of the superstructure and three aft. Her anti-aircraft armament consisted of four C/30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and five C/30 guns in single mounts. Z24 carried eight above-water torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchger√§t) passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S-Ger√§t sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 21 radar set above the bridge.Whitley, pp. 68, 71‚Äì72 =Modifications= Z24s single forward 15 cm gun was exchanged for a 15 cm LC/38 twin-gun turret during her late-1942 refit. This exacerbated the Type 36A's tendency to take water over the bow and reduced their speed to . Around the same time Z24 received a pair of quadruple 2 cm mounts and three more single 2 cm guns to give her a total of sixteen 2 cm guns. A FuMB 1 Metox radar detector was added later. When the ship docked in Brest, France, in June 1944, a pair of quadruple 2 cm mounts replaced single guns that had been mounted amidships.Gr√∂ner, p. 203; Koop & Schmolke, pp. 40, 105; Whitley, p. 159  Service history  Z24 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W958 on 2 January 1939, launched on 7 March 1940, and commissioned on 23 October. After working up, she began escorting ships between the Baltic and Norway in March 1941. On 12‚Äì13 June Z24 was one of the escorts for the heavy cruiser L√ºtzow as the latter ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic. Several Bristol Beaufort aircraft spotted L√ºtzow and her escorts off the Norwegian coast and one managed to surprise them and torpedo the cruiser early on the morning of 13 June, forcing her to return to Germany for repairs. Z24 was transferred to Brest on the 16th, together with her sister Z23, and they helped to escort the battleship through the Bay of Biscay on 20‚Äì24 July and covered the passage of the merchant raider through the bay on 21‚Äì28 August. They were ordered to northern Norway on 23 October.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 24, 102; Rohwer, p. 78, 110; Whitley, pp. 116, 122‚Äì24 At the end of November the sisters reached Troms√∏ and was assigned to the 8. Zerst√∂rerflottile (8th Destroyer Flotilla). On 17 December, Z24, along with her sisters Z23, Z25, and Z27, sortied into the Barents Sea on 16 December 1941, searching for Allied ships off the coast of the Kola Peninsula. The following day, Z25s radar spotted two ships in heavy fog at a range of . The Germans thought that they were Soviet destroyers, but they were actually two British minesweepers, and , sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them, but the heavy fog and icing precluded accurate gunfire. The British ships were able to escape despite four hits on Speedy and the heavy expenditure of ammunition. On 13 January 1942, Z25 escorted Z23 and Z24 as they laid a minefield in the western channel of the White Sea. A week later, Z23 accidentally rammed Z24 in heavy fog on 20 January, forcing the latter to return to Weserm√ºnde for repairs.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 102, 104; Rohwer, pp. 127, 135; Whitley, pp. 131‚Äì32 =Anti-convoy operations= After they were completed, the ship escorted the heavy cruiser to Norway on 18 March. Ten days later, Z24 and her sisters Z25 and departed the Varangerfjord in an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 13. Later that night they rescued 61 survivors of the sunken freighter then sank the straggling freighter . They rescued 7 survivors before resuming the search for the convoy. The light cruiser , escorted by the destroyer , spotted the German ships with her radar at 08:49 on the 29th and was spotted herself around the same time. Both sides opened fire at the point-blank range of in a snowstorm. Trinidad engaged the leading German destroyer, Z26, badly damaging her, and then switched to Z25 without making any hits. Between them the destroyers fired 19 torpedoes at the cruiser, all of which missed after Trinidad turned away, and hit her twice with their 15 cm guns, inflicting only minor damage. The British ships maneuvered to avoid torpedoes, which forced them to disengage, and Z26 accidentally became separated from her sisters. Trinidad and Fury pursued Z26 and further damaged her before Trinidad was crippled by one of her own torpedoes.Admiralty Historical Section 2007, pp. 27‚Äì29; Whitley, pp. 135‚Äì36 The destroyer took up the pursuit after Fury turned away to render assistance to the cruiser. After the sixth hit made by the British destroyer, Z26 lost power at 10:20 and was listing to port with her stern awash. Eclipse was maneuvering to give the German destroyer the coup de gr√¢ce with a torpedo when the snowstorm ended and visibility increased, revealing Z24 and Z25 approaching. They promptly opened fire at Eclipse, hitting her twice and wounding nine men, before she could find cover in a squall at 10:35. The German ships did not purse Eclipse, preferring to heave to and take off 88 survivors from Z26.Admiralty Historical Section 2007, pp. 29‚Äì30; Whitley, p. 136 The two destroyers, now reinforced by Z7 Hermann Schoemann and assigned to Zerst√∂rergruppe Arktis (Destroyer Group Arctic), commanded by Kapit√§n zur See (Captain) Alfred Schulze-Hinrichs, searched unsuccessfully for Convoys PQ 14 and QP 10 on 11 April.Rohwer, p. 158; Whitley, pp. 136‚Äì37 On 30 April the torpedoed and crippled the light cruiser , part of the close escort for Convoy QP 11. Later that day, the trio of destroyers were ordered to intercept her. The following afternoon they encountered the main body of the convoy and attacked in limited visibility. Over the next four hours, they made five attempts to close with the convoy, but the four escorting British destroyers were able to keep themselves between the Germans and the convoy. After being rebuffed, Schulze-Hinrichs decided to break off the attack and search for his original objective. The German ships were only able to sink the freighter, , with torpedoes from Z24 and Z25, and badly damage the escort destroyer with gunfire. The British ships did not make any hits on the German destroyers.Admiralty Historical Section 2007, pp. 37‚Äì39; Rohwer, p. 162; Whitley, pp. 136‚Äì38 Later that day, Edinburghs original escort of two destroyers was augmented by four British minesweepers and a small Russian tugboat. The cruiser was steaming under her own power at a speed of about by the morning of 2 May with steering provided by the tugboat. She was spotted by the Germans and Z7 Hermann Schoemann exchanged fire with the minesweeper at about 06:27. Edinburgh then cast off her tow and increased speed to her maximum of about , steering in a circle. Z7 Hermann Schoemann maneuvered at to obtain a good position from which to fire torpedoes once the range closed to . At 06:36, the cruiser opened fire, with the first salvo only missing by about . The destroyer immediately turned away, increased speed to , and started making smoke, but to no avail as the second salvo set her on fire and severed the main steam line, which disabled the engines. Z25 initially engaged the destroyer , hitting her three times at about 06:50, which disabled two guns and knocked out her power with a hit in her forward boiler room. Her sister passed in front of Forester a few minutes later to draw the attention of Z24 and Z25, which succeeded all too well as she was hit four times by 07:24, disabling the engines and leaving her with only a single gun operable. In the meantime, the cruiser had been hit once more by a torpedo at 07:02, although it only knocked out her engines and gave her a list to port. Rather than sink any of the three disabled British ships or the lightly armed minesweepers, Z24 and Z25 concentrated on rescuing the crew of the drifting Z7 Hermann Schoemann despite occasional British shells. The former made multiple attempts to come alongside to take off about 210 survivors while the latter laid a smoke screen. Z7 Hermann Schoemann was then scuttled using her own depth charges. Z24 was unscathed during the battle, but Z25 was hit once.Admiralty Historical Section 2007, pp. 40‚Äì42; Koop & Schmolke, p. 104; Whitley, pp. 138‚Äì40 The ship took part in the preliminaries of Operation R√∂sselsprung, an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 17 in early July. L√ºtzow and her sister formed one group in Narvik with Z24 and four of her sisters while Admiral Hipper and the battleship composed another. While en route to the rendezvous at the Altafjord, L√ºtzow and three destroyers of Tirpitzs escort ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation. On 12 July Z24 escorted one of the damaged destroyers to Kiel and then began a lengthy refit at Weserm√ºnde that lasted until January 1943.Koop & Schmolke, p. 104; Whitley, p. 141 =Operations in France= On 5 March 1943, the 8. Zerst√∂rerflottile (Z23, Z24, and ) was transferred via the English channel to the French Atlantic coast in Operation Karin. Despite attacks by British coastal artillery and motor torpedo boats, the flotilla managed to pass through the Straits of Dover unscathed, but Z37 ran aground at Le Havre en route. The flotilla provided distant cover for an attempt by the Italian blockade runner Himalaya to sail for the Far East on 28 March, but the ship had to return to Bordeaux after it was spotted by a British reconnaissance aircraft. Two days later, the flotilla escorted the Italian blockade runner Pietro Orseolo through the Bay of Biscay despite the ship being torpedoed by an American submarine and under heavy attack by Bristol Beaufighter fighter-bombers and Beaufort torpedo bombers; the German destroyers shot down five of the attacking aircraft. Himalaya made another attempt to break out on 9 April, but the ships were spotted by a Short Sunderland flying boat. After reversing course, they were attacked by Vickers Wellington bombers and Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers. Five of the attackers were shot down. On 14 June Z24 and Z32 sortied into the Bay of Biscay to take off the survivors of the sunken which had been rescued by . The flotilla escorted submarines through the bay for the rest of the summer. On 24‚Äì26 December, the ship was one of the escorts for the blockade runner through the Bay of Biscay.Koop & Schmolke, p. 105; Rohwer, pp. 236, 241, 256, 294; Whitley, pp. 145‚Äì46, 148 Another blockade runner, the refrigerated cargo ship , trailed Osorno by several days and four destroyers, including Z24, of the 8. Flotille and six torpedo boats of the 4. Torpedobootflotille (4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla) set sail on 27 December to escort her through the bay. The Allies were aware of these blockade runners through their Ultra code- breaking efforts and positioned cruisers and aircraft in the Western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. A Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber from No. 311 Squadron RAF sank Alsterufer later that afternoon. At about midday on 28 December, the British cruisers and , on patrol in the Bay of Biscay to intercept blockade runners, intercepted the German destroyers and torpedo boats, resulting in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay. Heavy seas prevented the German force from using its theoretical advantage in speed and firepower, with the destroyer Z27 and the torpedo boats and sunk. Z24 was neither engaged by the British cruisers nor fired its weapons and suffered engine problems during the battle.Rohwer, p. 295; Whitley, p. 149 The ship began a refit at La Pallice on 14 January 1944 that was completed in early May. After word of the Allied landings at Normandy on 6 June was received by Kapitan zur See Theodor von Bechtolsheim, commander of the 8. Zerst√∂rerflottile, ordered his three remaining destroyers, Z24, Z32, , and the torpedo boat , to sail for Brest to begin operations against the invasion fleet. They were attacked by Beaufighters during their journey, with Z32 damaged by a pair of rockets and one aircraft forced to ditch. Once they reached Brest, Z24 and Z32 had their anti-aircraft suites reinforced. On the night of 8/9 June, the four ships set out from Brest for Cherbourg, but were intercepted by eight Allied destroyers of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla in the Battle of Ushant. The German ships had been spotted first and the British opened fire first, with the Germans responding with a four-torpedo salvo from each destroyer that missed when the Allied ships turned to evade them. Their fire was extremely effective with Z24 badly damaged only moments after firing her first salvo. The range was so close that both sides engaged with their or 37 mm anti-aircraft guns which appreciably added to the damaged suffered by Z24. The Allied ships hit the German destroyer with five shells before she was able to lay smoke and disengage. The first shell struck the 15 cm loading room for the turret, severing all communication with the turret, while another shell devastated the forward superstructure, killing 13 men, and set the radio room on fire. Other shells hit the forward engine room, set the aft funnel and some ready-use ammunition on fire and destroyed one of the amidships quadruple 2 cm gun mounts. Two Canadian destroyers pursued Z24 and T24 until the German ships passed over a minefield and they reached Brest later in that evening.Rohwer, p. 332; Whitley, pp. 158‚Äì161 The ship was under repair at Bordeaux from 13 July to 5 August, but was attacked by Allied fighter-bombers on the 14th off Royan. She was struck by five rockets and ninety 20 mm shells that damaged her superstructure and gun turret. Z24 returned to Bordeaux for repairs, but was attacked by rocket-carrying Beaufighters off Le Verdon-sur- Mer on 24 August. The ship was struck three times with one dead and another wounded from the attack. She managed to come alongside a quay the next day, but later capsized and sank. Her crew was incorporated into the defender of Festung Gironde (Fortress Gironde) that held out until the surrender of Germany in May 1945.Koop & Schmolke, p. 105; Rohwer, p. 347; Whitley, pp. 162‚Äì63 Notes References  * External links * Kriegsmarine destroyers 1940 ships Ships built in Bremen (state) Type 1936A-class destroyers Maritime incidents in August 1944 World War II shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean Destroyers sunk by aircraft Ships sunk by British aircraft ","title":"German destroyer Z24"},{"id":"31562031","text":"Mark Hutchinson may refer to: * Mark Hutchinson (cricketer) (born 1978), Irish cricketer * Mark Michael Hutchinson, American actor *Mark Hutchinson (businessman) (born 1960), Former GE Executive and CEO of GE Europe See also * Mark Haigh-Hutchinson (1964‚Äì2008), English video-game developer * Mark Hutchison (born 1963), Lieutenant Governor of Nevada ","title":"Mark Hutchinson"},{"id":"31562034","text":"Andrew Bagg (born June 8, 1981), better known by his stage name DJ Cobra, is an open format deejay.

Completed in 1940, the ship spent most of the war in Norwegian waters, escorting German ships and laying minefields, despite venturing to France in early 1942 to successfully escort two battleships and a heavy cruiser home through the English Channel (the Channel Dash). She was very active in attacking the Arctic convoys ferrying war materials to the Soviet Union in 1941‚Äì1942, but only helped to sink one Allied ship herself. Engine problems in 1943 severely restricted her activities and she was transferred to the Baltic in early 1944 after repairs were completed. Z25 spent most of the rest of the war escorting ships as the Germans evacuated East Prussia and bombarding Soviet forces. The ship was captured by the Allies in May 1945 and spent the rest of the year under British control as the Allies decided how to dispose of the captured German ships. She was ultimately allotted to France in early 1946 and renamed Hoche. She became operational later that year and cruised to French colonies in Africa during 1947. The ship was placed in reserve in early 1949 before beginning a reconstruction from 1950‚Äì1953 that converted her into a fast destroyer escort. Worn out by 1956, Hoche was deemed too expensive to repair and decommissioned later that year. The ship was condemned in 1958 and scrapped in 1961. Design and description Wartime Allied recognition manual drawing of the Type 36A destroyer The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936 class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a maximum draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by six Wagner water-tube boilers for a designed speed of . Z25 carried a maximum of of fuel oil which gave a range of at . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.Gr√∂ner, pp. 203‚Äì04 The ship carried four TbtsK C/36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, one forward of the superstructure and three aft. They were designated No. 1 to 4 from front to rear. Her anti- aircraft armament consisted of four C/30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and five C/30 guns in single mounts. Z25 carried eight above-water torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchger√§t) passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S-Ger√§t sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24/25 radar set above the bridge.Whitley, pp. 68, 71‚Äì72 =Modifications= Z25s single forward 15 cm gun was exchanged for a 15 cm LC/38 twin-gun turret during her mid-1942 refit. This exacerbated the Type 36A's tendency to take water over the bow and reduced their speed to .Gr√∂ner, p. 203; Koop & Schmolke, p. 105 No. 3 gun was later removed to make room for additional AA guns under the 1944 Barbara program. By the end of the war, her anti-aircraft suite consisted of ten 3.7 cm guns in single and twin mounts and sixteen 2 cm weapons in twin and quadruple mounts. Most, if not all, of the 3.7 cm guns were to be the faster-firing Flak M42 model.Whitley, pp. 73‚Äì74 A FuMO 21 radar replaced the FuMO 24/25 in 1944 and FuMB 1 Metox, FuMB 3 Bali, and FuMB 6 Palau radar detectors were added that same year. A FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in 1944‚Äì1945 in lieu of the aft searchlight.Gr√∂ner, p. 204; Koop & Schmolke, p. 40 Service history Z25 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W959 on 15 February 1939, launched on 16 March 1940, and commissioned on 30 November. She finished working up on 26 June 1941 and sailed for Norway, but ran aground off Haugesund, damaging both propellers, and had to return to Bremen for repairs. Z25 was assigned to escort the Baltic Fleet, a temporary formation built around the battleship , as it sortied into the Sea of √Öland on 23‚Äì29 September to forestall any attempt by the Soviet Red Banner Baltic Fleet to breakout from the Gulf of Finland.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 24, 105; Rohwer, p. 103 Two months later Z25 accompanied her sister ships, and from Germany to Norway and arrived in Troms√∏ on 6 December where she was assigned to the 8. Zerst√∂rerflottile (8th Destroyer Flotilla). After arriving in Kirkenes, the ship replaced as the flagship of Kapit√§n zur See (Captain) Hans Erdmenger, commander of the flotilla, as the latter destroyer had engine problems and had to return to Germany for repairs. She led her sisters Z23, and Z27 out into the Barents Sea on 16 December 1941, searching for Allied ships off the coast of the Kola Peninsula. The following day, Z25s radar spotted two ships in heavy fog at a range of . The Germans thought that they were Soviet destroyers, but they were actually two British minesweepers, and , sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them, but the heavy fog and icing precluded accurate gunfire. The British ships were able to escape despite four hits on Speedy and the heavy expenditure of ammunition; Z25 and Z27 attempted to fire 11 torpedoes between them, but were only able to launch one each. On 13 January 1942, Z25 escorted Z23 and Z24 as they laid a minefield in the western channel of the White Sea.Koop & Schmolke, p. 105; Rohwer, pp. 127, 135; Whitley, pp. 131‚Äì32 On the 29th, Z25 sailed from Kirkenes to rendezvous with the destroyer at Vlissingen, the Netherlands, before continuing onward together to Brest, France, where they arrived on 7 February as part of the preparations for the Channel Dash. The German ships departed Brest on 11 February, totally surprising the British. During the sporadic attacks by the British, Z25 is not known to have engaged any British ships or aircraft, not was she damaged in any way. Shortly afterwards, the ship joined four other destroyers in escorting the heavy cruisers and to Trondheim. Heavy weather forced three of the destroyers to return to port before reaching their destination and Prinz Eugen was badly damaged by a British submarine after their separation.Koop & Schmolke, p. 105; Rohwer, p. 143; Whitley, pp. 118‚Äì20, 132‚Äì33 =Anti-convoy operations= On 6 March, Tirpitz, escorted by Z25 and three other destroyers, sortied to attack the returning Convoy QP 8 and the Russia-bound PQ 12 as part of Operation Sportpalast (Sports Palace). The following morning, Admiral Otto Ciliax, commanding the operation, ordered the destroyers to search independently for Allied ships and they stumbled across the Soviet freighter , a straggler from QP 8, later that afternoon and sank her. Tirpitz rejoined them shortly afterwards and Ciliax ordered the destroyers back to Trondheim on the 8th after failing to refuel them the previous night due to heavy seas and icing.Whitley, pp. 133‚Äì34 On 28 March, Z26 and her sisters Z24 and Z25 departed the Varangerfjord in an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 13. Later that night they rescued 61 survivors of the sunken freighter then sank the straggling freighter . They rescued 7 survivors before resuming the search for the convoy. The light cruiser , escorted by the destroyer , spotted the German ships with her radar at 08:49 on the 29th and was spotted herself around that same time. Both sides opened fire at the point-blank range of in a snowstorm. Trinidad engaged the leading German destroyer, Z26, badly damaging her, and then switched to Z25 without making any hits. Between them the destroyers fired 19 torpedoes at the cruiser, all of which missed after Trinidad turned away, and hit her twice with their 15 cm guns, inflicting only minor damage. The British ships maneuvered to avoid torpedoes, which forced them to disengage, and Z26 accidentally became separated from her sisters.Admiralty Historical Section 2007, pp. 27‚Äì29; Whitley, pp. 135‚Äì36 After Fury turned away to render assistance to the cruiser, the destroyer took up the pursuit, crippling Z26 by 10:20. Eclipse was maneuvering to give the German destroyer the coup de gr√¢ce with a torpedo when the snowstorm ended and visibility increased, revealing Z24 and Z25 approaching. They promptly opened fire at Eclipse, hitting her twice and wounding nine men, before she could find cover in a squall at 10:35.

The cruiser was steaming under her own power at a speed of about by the morning of 2 May with steering provided by the tugboat. She was spotted by the Germans and Z7 Hermann Schoemann exchanged fire with the minesweeper at about 06:27. Edinburgh then cast off her tow and increased speed to her maximum of about , steering in a circle. While Z7 Hermann Schoemann maneuvered to obtain a good position from which to fire torpedoes, the cruiser opened fire at 06:36, almost immediately severing the main steam line, which disabled the engines. Z25 initially engaged the destroyer , hitting her three times at about 06:50, which disabled two guns and knocked out her power with a hit in her forward boiler room. Her sister passed in front of Forester a few minutes later to draw the attention of Z24 and Z25, which succeeded all too well as she was hit four times by 07:24, disabling the engines and leaving her with only a single gun operable.

Z24 was unscathed during the battle, but Z25 was hit in the radio room, killing four and wounding seven. In Operation Zauberflote (Magic Flute), Z25, the destroyer , and two torpedo boats escorted the badly damaged Prinz Eugen from Trondheim to Kiel from 16‚Äì18 May. Shortly after her arrival, the destroyer began a lengthy refit that lasted until November.Admiralty Historical Section 2007, pp. 40‚Äì42; Koop & Schmolke, p. 105; Whitley, pp. 138‚Äì40 On 11 November, the ship escorted the light cruiser from Swinem√ºnde to Trondheim. In February 1943, she sailed to Germany in preparation for continuing onward to France, but engine problems caused that plan to be cancelled on 5 March. Z25 returned to Norwegian waters on April 22, but continuing engine problems kept her mostly inactive before her return to Germany for an overhaul in August. While running sea trials in Danzig Bay, the shock wave from a nearby mine explosion disabled her port turbine and required further repairs.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 105‚Äì06; Whitley, pp. 145‚Äì46 =Baltic operations= Now assigned to the 6. Zerst√∂rerflotille, Z25 and the other three destroyers of the flotilla were transferred to the Gulf of Finland to support minelaying operations there, Z25 arriving at Reval, Estonia, on 13 February 1944. The flotilla was initially tasked to escort convoys between Libau, Latvia, and Reval, but laid its first minefield in Narva Bay on 12 March while bombarding Soviet positions on the eastern shore of the bay. They were primarily tasked as minelayers through July.Koop & Schmolke, p. 106; Whitley, pp. 173‚Äì75 In preparation for Operation Tanne West, the occupation of the √Öland Islands in case of Finnish surrender, the flotilla escorted the heavy cruiser L√ºtzow to the island of Ut√∂ on 28 June, but the operation was canceled and the ships returned to port.Rohwer, p. 339 On 30 July and 1 August Z25 and three other destroyers of the flotilla sailed into the Gulf of Riga to bombard Soviet positions inland. On 5 August, they escorted Prinz Eugen as she engaged targets on the island of Oesel, Estonia, and in Latvia on 19‚Äì20 August. Between 15 and 20 September, the ship helped to evacuate 23,172 people from Reval in the face of the advancing Soviets. On 21 August, the ship, together with the destroyer , ferried 370 people from Baltischport, Estonia, to Libau. The following day, she escorted ships loaded with evacuees from the Sea of √Öland to Gotenhafen, Germany. On 10 October, Z25 ferried 200 reinforcements to Memel and evacuated 200 female naval auxiliaries the next day. Upon her return, the ship bombarded targets near Memel. She was then slightly damaged by a presumed near-miss from a torpedo and the vibrations from her own guns caused an oil leak on one of her fuel tanks.Koop & Schmolke, p. 106 On 4 November, Z25 was transferred to the 8. Zerst√∂rerflotille and supported L√ºtzow and Prinz Eugen as they engaged Soviet positions in Sworbe, on the Estonian island of Saaremaa, between 19 and 24 November. She was refitted in December and then bombarded Soviet troops east and south of K√∂nigsberg, together with Prinz Eugen and two torpedo boats on 29‚Äì30 January 1945 and again on 2‚Äì5 February to allow cut-off German Army units to break through into friendly territory. The ship then escorted many refugee ships carrying evacuees between Gotenhafen and Sassnitz before bombarding Soviet positions near the former city on the 20th. A month later, Z25 and Z5 Paul Jacobi escorted the ocean liner , the troopship and the target ship Canonier as they ferried 22,000 refugees to Copenhagen, Denmark, on 26 March. The ship continued to escort refugee ships between Hela and friendly territory through April and into May. On the 5th, she helped to convey 45,000 refugees to Copenhagen and returned to ferry 20,000 more to Gl√ºcksburg, Germany, on the 9th. The following day, Z25 was decommissioned.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 106‚Äì07; Rohwer, p. 414; Whitley, p. 180 =French service= After the war Z25 sailed to Wilhelmshaven and was overhauled to keep her seaworthy while the Allies decided how to divide the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves as war reparations. The ship was allotted to Great Britain in late 1945 and arrived in Rosyth, Scotland, on 6 January 1946. Following protests by France over her exclusion, the British transferred four of the destroyers that they had been allotted and Z25 arrived in Cherbourg on 2 February. Two days later, she was commissioned into the French Navy with the name of Hoche, after General Lazare Hoche. The ship was assigned to the 1st Division of Large Destroyers (contre-torpilleurs) and entered service in September when she conducted training with the light carrier . In March‚ÄìJune 1947, she formed part of the escort for the battleship as the President of France, Vincent Auriol, visited West and North Africa. Hoche visited Portsmouth, England, in December 1948 before she was reduced to reserve on 1 January 1949. From 1950 to 1953, the ship was rebuilt into a escorteur rapide (fast escort destroyer) with new weapons and electronics and was based in Toulon for anti-submarine trials. A major refit was necessary by 1956, but it was not economical and she was placed in reserve on 20 August before being decommissioned on 1 September. Hoche was condemned and redesignated Q102 on 2 January 1958; she was listed for sale on 30 June and scrapped in 1961.Koop & Schmolke, p. 107; Whitley, pp. 196‚Äì97 Notes Citations References  * External links * Kriegsmarine destroyers 1940 ships Ships built in Bremen (state) Type 1936A-class destroyers Destroyers of the French Navy ","title":"German destroyer Z25"},{"id":"31562054","text":"Rudolf Wilhelm Besier (2 July 1878 ‚Äì 16 June 1942) was a Dutch/English dramatist and translator best known for his play The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1930).

The Commodore took over the management of the hotel shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Kuehnle's Hotel served as the prime meeting place for some of the time's earliest gangsters, racketeers, politicians, and unscrupulous entrepreneurs. The site is now part of City Center Park. Location The Kuehnle Hotel was located at the corner of South Carolina and Atlantic Avenues in Atlantic City, NJ. After the building of the Pennsylvania Station Depot, Kuehnle saw much success as many boarders both arriving and departing chose to stay there because of its proximity to the depot. History The Corner Bar was the saloon located within the Kuehnle's hotel that served as a hub of Republican politics in Atlantic City and the place where important political decisions were made which later overturned the old Atlantic City elite. The Kuehnle's Hotel is credited with influencing some of the greatest political forces during the Prohibition Era such as, Harry Bacharach, Isaac Bacharach, and Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Johnson. Kuehnle's Hotel served as a place where Kuehnle and Johnson's father often discussed political ventures, allowing young Johnson to participate. In 1903, Kuehnle's Hotel was mistakenly reported sold to John H. Denny from Johnstown, Pennsylvania for a reported, $300,000 in The New York Times. Kuehnle's father had bought the property not long before for a reported $6,200. Allegedly, Denny acted as an agent for the Pennsylvania Railroad, buying both Kuehnle's hotel and the adjacent southwest corner of the street for a combined $425,000. This purchase was in order to immediately begin construction on a terminal station at the site of Kuehnle's Hotel. The station would also serve as a union for both the Pennsylvania and Reading railroad lines. Both Kuehnle and Denny repeatedly denied claims the deal had taken place. In 1919, Kuehnle closed the bar at his hotel. He later sold the property and the location was razed to make way for a new bank. The site is now part of City Center Park, a municipal park at South Carolina and Atlantic Avenues. Commodore Louis Kuehnle's Legacy When Commodore Kuehnle died in 1934, City Hall draped his city commissioners chair as well as the building in black, and commissioned all firehouses to display their flags at half mast. Currently Kuehnle Avenue is one of the few lasting memories of Kuehnle and the Kuehnle's Hotel.

The Act was the largest single Statute Law Revision Act or repealing measure ever enacted internationally. Background Prior to the 2007 Act, statute law revision had been sporadic since Irish independence in 1922. The Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act 1962 was one major such Act which repealed obsolete legislation of the Parliament of Ireland, which had provided that the Kings of England should be Kings of Ireland (from 1951 called in Northern Ireland the Crown of Ireland Act 1542), together with certain others from 1459 to 1800.STATUTE LAW REVISION (PRE-UNION IRISH STATUTES) ACT, 1962, section 1 and Schedule \\"Pre-Union Irish Statutes\\". Following this, the Statute Law Revision Act 1983 was the last major Act repealing pre-1922 statutes before the current phase of statute law revision, which commenced in 2003 and which also saw the enactment of an initial Act, the Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005. Scope The Attorney General of Ireland examined 26,370 public general statutes enacted before the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922. Of these 9,219 were already wholly repealed prior to 1 May 2007, and 12,562 were not applicable to Ireland. This left 4,589 statutes still in force, of which 3,225 were to be repealed by the Act and were listed in Schedule 2, some of which were in any case by then unconstitutional. The Act repealed all public general statutes enacted before 6 December 1922, listed or not, except for 1,364 explicitly in Schedule 1 of the Act; these were given short names where they did not already have them.For an account of the recording, printing and effect of the older statutes of the Parliament of Ireland which have now been repealed or left unrepealed see Maebh Harding, (sections 1 and 2 in) The curious incident of the Marriage Act (no 2) 1537 and the Irish statute book, Article first published online: 19 DEC 2011. Legal Studies, Journal of the Society of Legal Scholars, Volume 32, Issue 1, pages 78‚Äì108, March 2012. Private, local or personal Acts remained in force, with many of these repealed in the Statute Law Revision Act 2009. The number of Acts repealed in this one piece of legislation exceeded the number of public general Acts passed after 6 December 1922 (the start of the Irish Free State) up to 1 May 2007 (3,189). Acts repealed Among the numerous acts repealed were Poynings' Act 1495, the Government of Ireland Act 1920, the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 and the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922. Acts retained Among the older Acts retained were the Great Charter of Ireland (the Irish version of the Magna Carta) and the Mayor of Dublin Act 1229. The Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act 1543, which partitioned Meath in two, was also retained; as was the English Bill of Rights 1688The retention was the subject of subsequent comment, see http://www.dublin1313.com/site/2010/07/15/rossnowlagh-speech-by-rev-s-t-r- gamble/, however it was partly repealed, including the provision that guaranteed Protestants the right to bear arms. The Marriage Act (No 2) 1537 was also retained and this retention has been the subject of academic criticism from Dr Maebh Harding. Subsequent statute law revision programme Following the 2007 Act, the Oireachtas enacted further legislation dealing with Local and Personal and Private Acts enacted pre-1922, the Statute Law Revision Act 2009 and the Statute Law Revision Act 2012.

The episode originally aired on May 5, 2011, on NBC. The episode also marked Will Ferrell's final appearance as Deangelo, having signed up for four episodes. Cody Horn also makes her first guest appearance for the series as Jordan Garfield. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, new office manager Deangelo begins picking favorites among the staff, revealing his true management style. After he only picks men to join his \\"inner circle\\", many of the female staffers begin to believe he is sexist. The episode was written by Charlie Grandy and directed by Matt Sohn. The episode marks the first episode since Steve Carell left the series as a series regular. \\"The Inner Circle\\" received mixed reviews from critics, with many commenting on Ferrell's performance, with opinions ranging from positive to negative. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was viewed by an estimated 6.90 million households and received a 3.5 Nielsen rating and 10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 marking a drop in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Goodbye, Michael\\". Synopsis New office manager Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) picks favorites among the staff, including Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), a sycophantic Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who is attending business school thanks to Deangelo. He is also favorable towards Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who he believes is the head of the customer service department, and Kelly Kapoor's (Mindy Kaling) direct supervisor. Kelly is initially irate at the situation, but Ryan agrees to be a more dutiful boyfriend in exchange for Kelly keeping up the charade. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) desperately aspires to join the inner circle, while Deangelo repeatedly attempts to win over Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who is still apathetic toward the new boss. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) sees his style as sexist, as every member of the inner circle is male, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) agrees to, as Deangelo has repeatedly been acting coldly towards her; they persuade Jim to talk to Deangelo about it. To prove to the staff that he's not sexist, Deangelo hires a woman named Jordan Garfield (Cody Horn), who turns out to have no business experience (having previously worked in Anthropologie) over other qualified candidates, including a friend of Pam's. Kelly later attempts to tell Deangelo the truth about Ryan's actual position as a temp worker, but Deangelo simply appoints Ryan as the department head rather than figuring out the truth. Jim is kicked out of the inner circle after pointing out what the women of the office had said, and an enthusiastic Andy replaces him (despite having previously denounced Deangelo after deciding that he was sexist). Pam interrupts a mock basketball session the inner circle is having in the office in order to quiet it down, and an annoyed Deangelo reinvites Jim back into the circle. Jim instead challenges him to try a real dunk, which Deangelo claims he can do, at the warehouse basketball hoop downstairs. Deangelo brings everyone down to the warehouse, including Dwight, who Deangelo finally loses his temper with and directly orders him downstairs or be fired (ironically earning Dwight's respect, as he \\"respond[s] to strong leadership\\"). Deangelo then attempts to dunk from the free-throw line, only to severely injure himself by crashing down with the basketball stand on top of him. He is quickly taken to the hospital, leaving Dunder Mifflin Scranton without a manager. At the end of the episode, Deangelo makes it back to the office, still in his hospital gown, with an IV tube trailing from his arm. His attempts to tell a bar joke come out as random gibberish. Gabe and Jim lead him out of the office after Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) calls for an ambulance. Production \\"The Inner Circle\\" marked Will Ferrell's fourth and last appearance on The Office. The episode was written by supervising producer Charlie Grandy, his sixth writing credit of the series. It was directed by the series' cinematographer Matt Sohn, his second directing credit of the series. This is the first episode of The Office without former lead actor Steve Carell as Michael Scott. The feeling during filming was initially \\"weird\\", but the mood eventually changed to \\"very hopeful, excited and anticipatory feeling\\" according to Office showrunner Paul Lieberstein. The episode marked the final appearance in Will Ferrell's four-episode arc on the series after first appearing in \\"Training Day\\". The episode is also the first appearance of Cody Horn as Jordan Garfield, Deangelo's executive assistant, and the first of three new roles since Carell's departure. The role was originally said to be recurring at first with a chance of her becoming a series regular. She eventually did not return for the eighth season. In the final scene, Krasinski can be seen breaking character and putting his head down. The official website for The Office included three cut scenes from \\"The Inner Circle\\" within a week of its release. In the first 38 second clip, Deangelo invites Dwight on a weekend trip to a Los Lobos concert which Dwight declines once he learns he can't drive the bus. In a talking head, Dwight reveals that Deangelo makes his skin crawl. In the second 144 second clip, Andy tries to become Deangelo's new executive assistant while in a talking head Pam decides to give up trying to impress Deangelo. It is also revealed in the same talking head that Michael named his new dog after Pam. In the third 82 second clip, Jim attempts to get back into the inner circle. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast on May 5, 2011, \\"The Inner Circle\\" was viewed by an estimated 6.90 million households and received a 3.5 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a 17% drop in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", but marked a rise from the last regular episode, \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\". The episode tied for first in its timeslot beating Bones which received a 3.2 rating/9% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation which received a 2.3 rating/6% share and Nikita which received a 0.8 rating/2% share. The episode also tied for first in its timeslot with Grey's Anatomy. \\"The Inner Circle\\" was the fifth most-watched scripted show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18‚Äì49. =Reviews= The episode received mixed reviews from critics. The A.V. Club writer Myles McNutt compared the episode to \\"Training Day\\" commenting that The Inner Circle' is more successful than that episode ['Training Day'] on some levels\\", but \\"both episodes suffer from the same problem: They‚Äôre simply not very funny or meaningful, which I'd argue is even more problematic for \\"The Inner Circle\\" given its position in the season.\\" He ultimately gave the episode a C-. TV Squad writer Joel Keller wrote that while \\"the episode did have its funny moments\\", \\"overall, you can just feel that the show has changed in a very fundamental way\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix criticized the writers for still not finding Deangelo's character out commenting that \\"the fact that the writers so clearly had no idea what to do with Ferrell doesn't fill me with confidence for whatever guest stars turn up in the final episodes ‚Äì nor do I feel especially great right now about the idea of an outside character coming in as the permanent new regional manager.\\" IGN reviewer Cindy White praised the writing for Deangelo's character saying that \\"Ferrell is much better carrying the show on his own than being second banana to Carell. It seemed like he was having more fun with the role in this episode\\". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10. New Yorks Phoebe Reilly wrote that \\"while it was nice to see the staff responding to someone new, it didn't feel like enough to make an audience antsy to come back after a long summer.\\" Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly also gave the episode a mediocre review commenting that \\"judging by tonight's episode alone, the transition from the Carell era to the post-Carell era is going to be shaky, to say the least\\". \\"The Inner Circle\\" was voted the fourth lowest-rated episode out of 24 from the seventh season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally. In another poll, the episode was voted the third lowest-rated episode out of 24 from the seventh season and was rated 6.86 out of 10.

The M1923 was designed to consolidate the improvements of the 1915/19 model and to use the 9mm Glisenti round. However, due to the vast amount of handguns available after the end of World War I only 3000 samples, of about 10000 produced, were purchased by the Italian Army. History The Glisenti Model 1910 was the first Italian produced semi auto pistol adopted by the Italian military. Designed by Bethel Revelli it was originally chambered for a bottlenecked 7.65 mm round, which was similar to the 7.65√ó21mm Parabellum. Later, having the Italian Army judged the 7.65 round to be too light for military use, and having launched a competition for 9mm handguns instead, the Metallurgica Bresciana Tampini, owner of the design, adapted the Glisenti pistol to fire a 9mm round, obtained enlarging the original one (eliminating the bottleneck) without changing the load. Therefore, although being the cartridge dimensionally identical to the 9mm Luger (that was obtained in the same way from the 7.65√ó21mm Parabellum, but increasing the load) the 9mm Glisenti cartridge has a load that is about 1/4 lighter than the original military load of the 9mm Luger. The Glisenti Model 1910 suffered however from a lack of robustness due to its weak frame design. The bolt assembly in the receiver is supported only on one side. This lack of structural integrity led all of the stresses of firing to be taken up by just one side rail.Peterson, Phillip Standard Catalog of Military Firearms (5th Edition), p.230. Krause Publications, 2009 When Italy entered World War I, the need for more military pistols increased dramatically. In 1915, Tullio Marengoni from Beretta completed his design of a simple blowback action pistol that could fire the same 9mm Glisenti cartridge. This pistol was adopted by the Italian Army as the Beretta M1915. The M1915 is unusual in the fact that it used 2 manual safeties. One is a slide stop safety on the left side of the frame. The other is a small lever on the rear of the frame. If either safety is set, the pistol will not fire. Also manufactured by Beretta and adopted by the Italian military was a scaled-down version of this pistol in 7.65mm. In addition to being smaller, it did not have the manual safety at the rear of the frame. In 1919 improvements were made to the smaller 7.65mm M1915 design. The round post barrel mount where the barrel was lifted straight up out of the frame was replaced with a T slot mount. This required a larger opening in the top of the slide so the double opening of the M1915 was changed to a single longer one. The slide now looked like the characteristic open-top Beretta style. The redesigned pistol is marked on the slide 1915 - 1919, otherwise known as the M1915/19. In 1921 Beretta introduced a pistol in 9mm Glisenti caliber as a replacement for the military‚Äôs M1915 pistols. It incorporated the M1915/1919 changes plus adding an external hammer. The M1923 is a semi- automatic pistol with a barrel and 7 shot detachable magazine. The slide is marked \\"Brev 1915-1919 Mlo 1923.\\" Some of the M1923 pistols have grooves for a shoulder stock holster machined into the bottom of the grip frame. The shoulder stock holster was unlike the Mauser in that it was a conventional leather holster with a hinged folding steel arm riveted to the spine. The end of the arm had a cut out that slipped over the butt of the pistol and locked in place.

Completed in early 1941, the ship spent her active career in Norwegian waters. She first arrived there in November, but was plagued with engine problems and had to return to Germany for repairs in January 1942. Z26 returned to Norway two months later and became flagship of a destroyer flotilla. Together with two of her sisters, she attempted to intercept Convoy PQ 13. They rescued survivors from an already sunken ship before Z26 sank one straggler from the convoy. The three destroyers were spotted by a British light cruiser that badly damaged Z26 before one of the cruiser's torpedoes circled back around and crippled her. Pursuit of Z26 was taken over by a British destroyer that so badly damaged her that she was drifting and on fire when the timely arrival of the other two German destroyers prevented the British ship from sinking Z26. They were able to rescue 88 survivors and a submarine later rescued 8 others; 243 crewmen were killed in the battle.

The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W960 on 1 April 1939, launched on 2 April 1940, and commissioned on 9 January 1941. She was assigned to escort the Baltic Fleet, a temporary formation built around the battleship , as it sortied into the Sea of √Öland on 23‚Äì29 September to forestall any attempt by the Soviet Red Banner Baltic Fleet to break out from the Gulf of Finland.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 24, 108; Rohwer, p. 103 On 9 November, Z26 and her sister ship sailed for northern Norway; at Troms√∏ her lubrication pump for her starboard low-pressure turbine broke down, destroying the rotor blades. With her repairs completed by 14 December, she joined her sisters of the 8. Zerst√∂rerflottile (8th Destroyer Flotilla) at Kirkenes, although another lubrication pump broke down and she could not participate in the planned sortie off the Murmansk coast. Still plagued by machinery troubles, Z26 departed for Germany on 5 January 1942 for a refit. Refit completed, she escorted the heavy cruiser from Brunsb√ºttel, Germany, to Trondheim, Norway, on 18 March and then accompanied the heavy cruiser from Trondheim to Narvik, reaching Kirkenes on the 27th.Koop & Schmolke, p. 107; Rohwer, p. 152; Whitley, pp. 130‚Äì31 On 28 March, Z26, now the flagship of Kapit√§n zur See Gottfried P√∂nitz, commander of the 8. Flotille, departed the Varangerfjord in an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 13 together with her sisters Z24 and . Later that night they rescued 61 survivors of the sunken freighter then sank the straggling freighter . Z26 attacked her with gunfire, then finished her off with a torpedo. The Germans rescued 7 survivors before resuming the search for the convoy. The light cruiser , escorted by the destroyer , spotted the German ships with her radar at 08:49 on the 29th and was spotted herself around that same time. Both sides opened fire at the point-blank range of in a snowstorm. Trinidad engaged the leading German destroyer, Z26, and hit her with her second salvo from her forward guns. Her shells knocked out two 15 cm guns, damaged the port turbine room and started a large fire. Between them the destroyers fired 19 torpedoes at the cruiser, all of which missed after Trinidad turned away, and hit her twice with their 15 cm guns, inflicting only minor damage. Both sides maneuvered to avoid torpedoes, which forced them to disengage, and accidentally separated Z26 from her sisters. Trinidads radar found the damaged destroyer and the cruiser altered course and increased speed to intercept. She opened fire at 09:17 at a range of at the wildly maneuvering Z26, scoring only three hits from 37 main-gun salvoes. Trying to finish off the badly damaged destroyer, Trinidad fired a single torpedo five minutes later; two other torpedoes failed to leave their tubes due to icing. The one torpedo circled back around and struck Trinidad, crippling the cruiser. The German destroyer attempted to disengage, but Fury, which had not yet fired during the battle, set off in pursuit.Admiralty Historical Section 2007, pp. 27‚Äì29; Whitley, pp. 135‚Äì36 Z26 passed by three destroyers of the convoy's escort, but only the two Soviet ships, and , fired at her through the snow; thought the German ship was Trinidad. Fury fired two salvoes without effect at Eclipse at 09:30 before recognizing her as friendly and turned back to render assistance to Trinidad. Eclipse then took up the pursuit and her radar spotted Z26 at a range of about . She opened fire when the range decreased to . The German ship attempted to disengage under the cover of a smoke screen, but was unsuccessful as Eclipse continued to hit her. After the sixth hit, Z26 lost power at 10:20 and was listing to port with her stern awash. The British destroyer was maneouvering to give the German destroyer the coup de gr√¢ce with her last torpedo when the snowstorm ended and visibility increased, revealing Z24 and Z25 approaching. They promptly opened fire at Eclipse, hitting her twice and wounding nine men, before she could find cover in a squall at 10:35. The German ships did not purse Eclipse, preferring to heave-to and take off 88 survivors.

She sank a Soviet oil tanker in late 1942 before sailing to Germany for a refit. Upon its completion in mid-1943, Z27 returned to Norway and participated in Operation Zitronella, the raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September. The ship sailed to France the following month and became the flagship of the 8. Zerst√∂rerflottile (8th Destroyer Flotilla) upon her arrival. The flotilla was tasked to escort several blockade runners through the Bay of Biscay in December despite Allied efforts to find and sink them. The first ship made it through the gauntlet successfully, but the second one was found and sunk while the German ships were en route to the rendezvous point. They were intercepted by a pair of British light cruisers and Z27 was sunk during the ensuing Battle of the Bay of Biscay on 28 December, with the loss of approximately 300 of her crew.

The following day, Z25s radar spotted two ships in heavy fog at a range of . The Germans thought that they were Soviet destroyers, but they were actually two British minesweepers, and , sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them, but the heavy fog and icing precluded accurate gunfire. The British ships were able to escape despite four hits on Speedy and the heavy expenditure of ammunition; Z25 and Z27 attempted to fire 11 torpedoes between them, but were only able to launch one each. Z27 then developed problems with her propeller shaft and sailed for Germany on 5 January 1942 to begin a refit.

Three weeks later, the same four destroyers escorted Admiral Hipper as she attempted to intercept Allied merchant ships proceeding independently to Soviet ports in early November. While searching for convoy traffic at the far end of the patrol line, Z27 was alerted to the presence of a tanker by the Admiral Hippers float plane on 7 November and set off in pursuit. The destroyer first intercepted and sank the submarine chaser BO-78 then caught up to and sank the westbound Soviet oil tanker Donbass, rescuing survivors from both ships.Koope & Schmolke, p. 108; Rohwer, pp. 127, 202, 207; Whitley, pp. 131‚Äì32, 142 On 2 December, Z27 sailed to Bremen to begin a refit, returning to Norway on 15 June 1943. Together with Z30, she conducted several minelaying missions off southern Norway between 19 and 28 June. The ship took part in the raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September, during which she landed troops on the island. On the 24th she was one of four destroyers escorting L√ºtzow to Kiel, Germany, and then proceeded to France on 31 October, together with the destroyer . During the voyage to Le Verdon-sur-Mer, both ships were slightly damaged by splinters from British coastal artillery as they passed through the English Channel.

The Allies were aware of these blockade runners through their Ultra code-breaking efforts and positioned cruisers and aircraft in the Western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. A Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber from No. 311 Squadron RAF sank Alsterufer later that afternoon.Rohwer, p. 295; Whitley, p. 149 The German ships were unaware of the sinking until the following afternoon and continued onward to the rendezvous point. They had been spotted by an American Liberator bomber on the morning of the 28th and the British light cruisers and , which were assigned to Stonewall, maneuvered to intercept them. By this time, the weather had gotten significantly worse and the German ships were steaming for home, hampered by the rough seas that threw spray over their forward guns that made them very hard to work. In addition the spray severely reduced visibility and hampered the rangefinders and sights for the guns and torpedoes. Using her radar, Glasgow was the first to open fire at the closest German ships, Z27 and her sister Z23, at 13:46 at a range of with Enterprise following a few minutes later. Z23 fired six torpedoes once the range closed to , but they all missed. About that time, the destroyers began firing back. At 14:28 Z27 fired a spread of four torpedoes, which also missed, shortly after Erdmenger decided to split his forces and ordered Z23, Z27, and three torpedo boats to reverse course to the north. Seven minutes later, Z27 fired the rest of her ready torpedoes, all of which missed their target. The British ships pursued the northern group and a shell from Enterprise hit the destroyer in No. 2 boiler room shortly afterwards, severing the starboard main steam line, which forced the evacuation of the boiler room and knocked out the starboard turbine. The effects of the damage began to accumulate and the other boilers began to fail over the next hour or so, as did the feed pumps for the port turbine. While pursuing the scattered German forces several hours later, Glasgow spotted the drifting Z27 and closed to point-blank range before sinking her with gunfire at 16:41. A total of 93 men were rescued by a German submarine, Spanish destroyers, and an Irish merchantman, , but about 300 crewmen were killed.Koop & Schmolke, p. 108; Rohwer, p. 295; Whitley, pp. 149‚Äì156 Notes References  External links * Kriegsmarine destroyers 1940 ships Ships built in Bremen (state) Type 1936A-class destroyers Maritime incidents in December 1943 World War II shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean ","title":"German destroyer Z27"},{"id":"31562143","text":"Gerrit Alexander Pressel (born 19 June 1990) is a German professional footballer who is currently a free agent.

From 2011 to 2012, he was Minister of Agriculture. On 6 August 2012, the Syrian government released a statement saying that Hijab had been dismissed. Shortly thereafter a man describing himself as Hijab's spokesman and several news organizations stated he had resigned and defected to the rebel side in the Syrian civil war. Information minister Omran al-Zoub's later remarks about \\"the flight of some personalities\\" were interpreted by The Guardian as referring to Hijab. Hijab is the highest-ranking defector from the Syrian government. Early life and education Hijab was born into a Sunni Muslim family of the city of Deir ez-Zor in Deir ez-Zor Governorate in 1966. He holds a doctorate (PhD) in agricultural engineering. Career Hijab was the president of the Azzour branch of the National Union of Syrian Students from 1989 to 1998, and he was a member of the leadership of the Ba'ath Party Branch from 1998 to 2004. In 2004, Hijab became secretary of the Deir ez-Zor branch of the Ba'ath Party, a post which he retained until 2008. Hijab was appointed governor of Quneitra Governorate in 2008, and on 22 February 2011, he was appointed governor of Latakia Governorate. His appointment occurred at the initial phase of the Syrian Civil War. He was also named as the head of the security committee in the province to monitor and suppress the opposition activities. He was appointed minister of agriculture and agrarian reform on 14 April 2011, replacing Adel Safar who had been named Prime Minister of Syria. On 6 June 2012, after a parliamentary election, which was boycotted by the rebels, Hijab was named by President Bashar al-Assad as Prime Minister of Syria. BBC News described him as \\"a staunch Assad loyalist and a key member of the ruling Ba'ath Party.\\" The appointment reportedly surprised experts, as al- Assad had been expected to give his government more credibility by naming a non-Ba'athist. Shortly after his appointment as prime minister, the US Treasury sanctioned him. Defection According to Hijab's former spokesman Mohammad Otari, Hijab resigned, and he and his family defected to Jordan on 6 August 2012. Syrian state TV reported that Hijab had been \\"sacked\\" and that Deputy PM Omar Ibrahim Ghalawanji would become the head of a new caretaker government. Hijab released a statement through Otari criticizing the current Syrian government, calling it a \\"terrorist regime\\". The statement declared \\"I am from today a soldier in this blessed revolution\\". According to Otari, Hijab had been planning his defection for months with the help of the Free Syrian Army. Hijab was reportedly heading for Qatar, an active supporter of the Syrian rebels. Speaking in Amman, Jordan, on 14 August 2012, Hijab alleged that Assad's current government was collapsing \\"morally, financially and militarily\\", allegedly only controlling a mere 30% of the entire country still. He called on the Syrian Arab Army and its officers to join the rebellion against president Assad and the Ba'ath party government and for the opposition forces to unite. On 17 August, Hijab held meetings in Doha, Qatar, to discuss Assad's toppling and to attempt unification of Syrian opposition forces. According to his spokesman Otari on August 6, Hijab also encouraged other officials to defect, and opposition sources claimed that three other ministers as well as three army generals defected on the same day. However, one of the ministers named by the opposition, Treasurer of Syria Mohamad Gillati appeared on Syrian television later in the day to deny the rumors of his defection to the rebellion. Though Hijab was not considered a member of Assad's inner circle, BBC News described his departure as the \\"highest-profile defection since the uprising began in March 2011\\" and \\"a stunning blow to President Assad\\". Guardian writer Ian Black called it \\"a propaganda coup for the opposition\\" but not a \\"fatal blow\\". The United States government stated that the \\"defection\\" showed Assad's government was \\"crumbling from within\\". The Barack Obama administration again called for al-Assad's resignation. Hijab's duties were fulfilled ad-interim by Syrian minister Omar Ibrahim Ghalawanji, who on 9 August 2012 transferred his duties to newly appointed Prime Minister of Syria Dr. Wael Nader al-Halqi, formerly Syrian Minister of Public Health, a Jasim-born Sunni Ba'ath Party official and professor of medical science. President al-Assad rated Hijab's defection as rather positive by stating that it was \\"self-cleansing of the government firstly, and the country generally\\". According to Der Spiegel, Hijab and other prominent Syrian defectors were bribed by the French secret services inside the country as well as by Qatar. Moussa al-Omar conveyed his concerns over the medical treatment and health of Hijab in a tweet. Role in Syrian opposition Hijab was selected in Riyadh in December 2015 by Syrian opposition as a head of the Supreme Negotiations Committee (also called Higher Negotiation Committee) which selected the negotiation delegation for the Geneva III negotiation process. In 2017 he resigned as head of the group following Saudi pressure. Political positions Hijab has said that he is against federalism in Syria. Personal life Hijab is married and has four children and is a Sunni Muslim.

He is best known for landscapes, portraits and nudes. The De Saisset Museum in Santa Clara is named after him. Biography His father, Pierre de Saisset (1829-1902), came from a notable French family that included Vice-Admiral . Upon immigrating to California to take advantage of the Gold Rush, he changed his name to Pedro, becoming a businessman and French consular agent; later serving as Vice- Consul. Years later, he helped incorporate and served as President of the Brush Electric Light Company branch in San Jose. Ernest's mother, Maria Palomares, was a native Californian who had recently been widowed and owned a large ranch.De Saisset family history @ Santa Clara University. Ernest attended classes at Santa Clara College. While there, he received prizes in French, elocution, calligraphy and design, which was awarded in 1883 for an oil painting. He therefore decided to pursue a career in art and, unable to find what he felt was adequate instruction there, went to Paris to attend the Acad√©mie Julian. With the assistance of an uncle who lived there, he was able to find a studio near the Acad√©mie. He stayed in Paris for nine years altogether, studying with Jules Lefebvre, Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant and William Bouguereau, among others. At one point, he tried to set up an exhibit at the Salon, but was discouraged by what he felt was favoritism for native- born French people.California history, volume 79, California Historical Society, 2000, pg. 177. In 1895, he returned to California; painting nudes, landscapes and numerous portraits. He died only a few years later, at the age of thirty-five, of what was diagnosed as \\"rheumatism\\". His sister Isabel, who died in 1950, bequeathed a large sum for the establishment of an art museum, to be named in his honor, at Santa Clara University. It was dedicated in 1955 and contains most of his extant paintings.

Ware: Site Operator Program Final Report for Fiscal Years 1992 through 1996 Lockheed Idaho Technologies Co., Idaho Falls, ID (United States), 1998 It consisted of a stock body and transmission from the Ford Escort, refitted with an electric propulsion system, every component of which was engineered and manufactured specifically for the car. It incorporated features such as regenerative braking and a multistep charging algorithm, that are common on modern electric vehicles but were quite innovative at the time. The intent was to produce a practical alternative- fueled vehicle with performance comparable to gasoline-powered cars, but like many electric vehicles of that era, the EVcort proved far too expensive to be commercially viable. Nevertheless, the it was used extensively by a variety of institutions for electric vehicle demonstration and testing programs.  Electric Drive Train  The distinguishing feature of the EVcort was the use of sophisticated electronics to extract maximum efficiency from the lead-acid battery pack. All of the electronic components: controller, charger, DC/DC converter and DC/AC inverter, were designed specifically for the EVcort by Shunjiro Ohba, a PhD. electrical engineer at Soleq. The car was built under his supervision using engineless Escorts obtained directly from Ford Motor Company. Unlike other direct current (DC)-based electric vehicles of the period, which used series-wound motors, the EVcort used a separately excited (SepEx) traction motor that was built to order for the car by General Electric. This configuration allowed the inclusion of regenerative braking to maximize driving range, but required a particularly complex controller to regulate the armature and field independently.D.R. Neill and Z. Guo: EV, EB and remote power‚ÄîNiMH is the battery of choice. Renewable Energy 3: 239-243, 1993 The controller was the size of a suitcase and incorporated over 300 transistors. The power circuit for the armature used 120 bipolar transistors wired in parallel, giving a maximum 400 amps or 40 kWatts of traction, with another 60 bipolar transistors for regenerative braking of up to 200 amps. By automatically weakening the field current in response to armature current at high RPM, the controller maintained high motor torque over a wide range of motor speeds, allowing the car to accelerate from a standing start to 45 mph without shifting gears.S. Ohba: \\"DC Machine Control Circuit\\" Patent 4,322,667, United States Patent Office, 1982, http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4322667.pdf It operated at a relatively low pulse-width modulation (PWM) frequency of 800 Hz, thus requiring large capacitors and chokes to filter the ripple. The traction pack consisted of eighteen 6‚Äëvolt lead-acid batteries for a total of 108 volts. Initially, standard flooded golf cart batteries were used, replaced in later models by Sonnenshein gel cells. The EVcort was a highway-capable vehicle with a top speed of approximately 70 mph.Soleq Corporation: \\"1992-1994 Soleq EVcort Owners Manual\\" Soleq Corporation, 1992  Accessories  Early EVcorts had a gasoline heater, while later models had an electric ceramic heater, as well as an air conditioner powered by an AC inverter. Power for accessories was provided by a 40‚Äëamp DC-to-DC converter that took its 800‚ÄëHz switching signal from the controller. The charger operated at 110 volts AC input and had a complex charging cycle, with an initial constant current that was switchable at 16, 20 or 30 amps, followed by a constant voltage (\\"float\\") that was adjustable to accommodate different battery types and compensated for seasonal temperature changes, and finally a trickle phase to maintain a full charge. Post-1990 models had a feature whereby the heater or air conditioner could be set to prewarm or precool the cabin to a specified temperature using power from the AC line once charging was complete, thus minimizing use of the batteries for climate control.  History  When production began in 1980, EVA intended to produce hundreds of EVcorts for sale to the general public, but the complexity of the electronics resulted in prohibitively high production costs. By 1992, with a sale price of $58,000, the EVcort was being marketed only as a battery testing platform, rather than a general-use vehicle.James R. Hague: DOE/KEURP Site Operator Program Year 2 Second Quarter Report Kansas State University, Manhattan KS (United States), 1992, DOE ID 13704‚ÄîT6, http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/7082576-BmpICP/7082576.pdf Sales were therefore effectively limited to institutions such as electric utilities and government agencies. From 1988 through 1994, the United States Department of Energy sponsored many of these purchases as part of its Site Operator program to evaluate the performance of various electric vehicle designs in fleet use. In general, the EVcort performed well in these tests, receiving high marks for its reliability, but with some complaints of inadequate acceleration. Because of liability issues, it was Soleq's policy that the cars should be scrapped upon completion of testing. Nevertheless, some were eventually sold to hobbyists and as of 2011 a few remain in use, although most of the original Soleq controllers have failed and been replaced with modern high-frequency MOSFET controllers. Also built by EVA were the re- shaped Escorts called EXP s. The EXPs have the same electric components as the EVA Escorts. Only 4 of these EVA-built EXPs are known to have exists.

During the first years of the French Revolutionary Wars he enjoyed very rapid promotion to the rank of general officer in the army of the French First Republic. In May and June 1794 he emerged as co-commander of an army that tried three times to cross the Sambre at Grandreng, Erquelinnes and Gosselies and each time was thrown back by the Coalition. After that, he reverted to a division commander and saw more service in the north of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In the campaign of 1805, he led an infantry division under Marshal Pierre Augereau in Emperor Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e and saw limited fighting. In 1806 he fought at Jena, Czarnowo and Go≈Çymin. He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Eylau on 8 February 1807 and died three days later. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 16. Revolution Born on 9 February 1759 in Angers, France, Desjardin joined the French army on 8 December 1776 at the age of 17. Since his father worked as a humble valet, Desjardin's prospects of advancement in the Vivarais Infantry Regiment were poor. He became a corporal in 1781 and sergeant in 1789. He was granted leave to see his father in 1790 and immediately threw himself into the task of drilling his hometown National Guard unit. Coming to the attention of the revolutionary authorities, he was appointed adjutant general on 5 August 1791.Mulli√©, Jacques Jardin The Battle of Jemappes After a reorganization, Desjardin became lieutenant colonel of the 2nd Battalion of the Maine-et-Loire National Guard. He led his troops in the Army of the North at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792. This action was followed by the Siege of Namur, which lasted from early November until the Austrian surrender on 2 December. During the siege, Desjardin's battalion served in the Left Brigade of Louis-Auguste Juv√©nal des Ursins d'Harville's Reserve Division.Smith, 32. Smith misspelled Harville as Marville. In the actions during Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez's subsequent retreat from Belgium, Desjardin greatly distinguished himself. On 3 September 1793, he received promotion to general of brigade. When he became a general of division on 19 March 1794, he already had charge of three divisions. By 4 May 1794, Desjardin had command over a 31,736-strong army that consisted of Fran√ßois Muller's division, 14,075 men, Jacques Fromentin's division, 10,619 soldiers, and √âloi Laurent Despeaux's division, 7,042 troops. One month later, Desjardin's Right Wing of the Army of the North had grown to a strength of 37,147 men. There were 43 infantry battalions, nine cavalry regiments, and three artillery companies under his orders.Smith, 70‚Äì71. The author misspelled Muller as Miller The French strategy for 1794 called for Desjardins to join the Right Wing with Louis Charbonnier's Army of the Ardennes to form a 60,000-man army to strike toward Mons. The objective was later changed to Charleroi. Unfortunately, the Army of the North's commander Jean-Charles Pichegru neglected one of the basic principles of warfare by failing to appoint a single overall commander for the army. Between 11 May and 3 June this force crossed the Sambre river three times and was driven back each time. In one overheard conversation between the co-commanders, Charbonnier sounded like a buffoon. He noted that the troops were starving and they needed to cross the river to feed them, to which Desjardin replied that the crossing must be arranged in a military fashion. Charbonnier answered, \\"Good, you work out the details. As for me, I'm in charge of eating vegetables and pumping oil\\". One political agent attached to the army remarked, \\"I did not see the shadow of treason, but the incapacity of the leaders was flagrant\\". Nevertheless, the oft-beaten army returned to the fray each time \\"as if it had come fresh from the barracks\\". In his critique of the French defeat in the Battle of Grandreng, historian Victor Dupuis noted that the 53,000 French soldiers should have made quick work of Franz Wenzel, Graf von Kaunitz-Rietberg's 22,000 Allies. Instead Desjardin with 35,000 poorly trained troops attacked Kaunitz's men in fortified positions without support from the French heavy cannons because of the poor condition of the roads. While the battle was going on, the uncooperative Charbonnier was to the east on a foraging expedition. As Guillaume Philibert Duhesme later wrote, \\"We were all children in the art of war\\". For the next attempt, the army was to be guided by a council of Generals Desjardin, Charbonnier, Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber and Barth√©lemy Louis Joseph Sch√©rer. The French army re-crossed the Sambre and on 21 May the opposing armies fought a drawn battle during which one of the Army of the Ardennes divisions remained completely inert because Charbonnier failed to approve its movements. Two days later, the committee of generals authorized Kl√©ber to take 15,000 troops on a raid to the north. On 24 May in the Battle of Erquelinnes, Kaunitz launched a pre-dawn attack in five columns, catching Desjardin's troops completely by surprise and capturing hundreds of sleepy French soldiers. Total disaster was averted when Kl√©ber heard cannon fire and countermarched, helping to slow the Allied pursuit. Urged on by the political agents, the French generals decided to attempt a third advance. With the better part of this force, Desjardin laid siege to Charleroi. On 3 June, a 28,000-man Austro-Dutch relief force under William V, Prince of Orange defeated him in the Battle of Gosselies, inflicting 2,000 casualties on the 27,000 French who were present and capturing one 12-pound cannon. For a loss of 424 killed and wounded, the allies drove the French south of the Sambre and broke the siege. Charbonnier was sacked and Desjardin was given command of the army. However, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's 45,000-strong Army of the Moselle arrived and on 8 June took over command from Desjardin. On 13 June the combined force became the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. Desjardin participated in the siege of Le Quesnoy, which ended on 16 August 1794 with an Austrian surrender.Smith, 89 During the Siege of Luxembourg his division and two others replaced the original besieging corps. Desjardin's 8th Division counted 12,972 infantry, 682 cavalry, 205 gunners and 188 sappers. His 1st Brigade under Jean-Baptiste Rivet was made up of the 53rd and 87th Line and the 1st Battalion of the Sarthe Volunteers and the 5th Battalion of the Yonne. Nicolas Soult's 2nd Brigade included the 66th and 116th Line. The division's mounted contingent was the 7th Cavalry Regiment.Lefort (1905), 69‚Äì71 After the reduction of Luxembourg City, which lasted until June 1795, Desjardin remained in the Army of the North. During 1796 he became part of the occupation forces of the former Dutch Republic. After the Rhine Campaign of 1796, Desjardin took command of the division of Jean Castelbert de Castelverd who was in disgrace. In February 1797 he replaced Jacques MacDonald in command of the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse's Left Wing. In October 1801 he was placed on inactive duty. Empire Marshal Pierre Augereau On 28 February 1804, the soon-to-be Emperor Napoleon made Desjardin a member of the L√©gion d'Honneur and recalled him to military service at Brest. In recognition of his services, the emperor appointed him a Commander of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 14 June 1804. In 1805, Desjardin was appointed to command a division in Marshal Augereau's VII Corps.Chandler Campaigns, 1103 Having a long march from Brest to the Danube at the start of the War of the Third Coalition, Augereau's corps missed the Ulm Campaign in October 1805. While the main army was headed for a showdown at the Battle of Austerlitz, the VII Corps operated against enemy troops in the Vorarlberg. The French tracked down Franz Jellacic's Austrian division on the upper reaches of the Iller River.Chandler Campaigns, 402-403 On 13 November 1805, Augereau, accompanied by Desjardin's 1st Division forced Jellacic to surrender in the Capitulation of Dornbirn. Three generals, 160 officers, and 3,895 rank and file laid down their arms and were permitted to march to Bohemia where they were not to undertake operations against France for one year. Seven colors became trophies of the French.Smith, 214 At the beginning of the War of the Fourth Coalition, Desjardin still commanded the 1st Division of the VII Corps, a total of 8,242 soldiers and eight artillery pieces. Pierre Belon Lapisse's brigade consisted of the 4-battalion 16th Light Infantry Regiment. Jacques Lefranc's brigade comprised the 44th and 105th Line Infantry Regiments, three battalions each, and the 2nd Battalion of the 14th Line Infantry Regiment. The divisional artillery was made up of a half company each of foot and horse artillery and included two 12-pound guns, four 6-pound guns, and two 6-inch howitzers.Chandler Jena, 37 At the Battle of Jena, Augereau's corps formed the left flank as Napoleon engaged the Prussian-Saxon army of Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen. Led by Lapisse's 16th Light, Desjardin led his division up the Schneke Pass against Hans Gottlob von Zeschwitz's Saxon Division posted on the Prussian right flank. They soon bore to the right to form a flank guard to Marshal Jean Lannes' main attack.Chandler Jena, 54 map As the French attack pressed forward, the 1st Division captured the village of Isserstadt around 11:30 AM.Chandler Jena, 60 Print by Carle Vernet showing the Battle of Jena from the French point of view. Desjardin's position was at the extreme left of the picture. When Ernst von R√ºchel made his belated and futile attack after 1:00 PM, it was opposed by the artillery of Desjardin, as well as the guns of Marshals Nicolas Soult, Michel Ney, and Lannes.Petre Prussia, 142-143 Meanwhile, Augereau's main assault fell on Zeschwitz's Saxons and a supporting Prussian brigade under Karl Anton Andreas von Boguslawsky. While √âtienne Heudelet de Bierre's 2nd Division hammered at the Saxons from the front,Petre Prussia, 143 part of Desjardin's division turned their left flank. By 3:00 PM, the Saxons were completely cut off from Hohenlohe's main army. Seeing an opportunity, Marshal Joachim Murat led Louis Klein's dragoons to take the Saxons in the rear while Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers attacked their left flank.Petre Prussia, 144 Zeschwitz cut his way out of the trap at the head of 300 cavalrymen, but a total of 6,000 Saxons and Prussians were forced to surrender.Petre Prussia, 145 In November, the corps of Lannes, Augereau, and Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout thrust into Prussian Poland.Chandler Campaigns, 514 In late December, Napoleon launched an offensive against the Russian Empire armies that were gathering against him.Petre Poland, 75 At the Battle of Czarnowo on 23 and 24 December, the French pressed their enemies back.Petre Poland, 79-82 Also on the 24th, Augereau directed his two divisions to force a crossing of the Wkra River in the face of nine Russian infantry battalions and five cavalry squadrons under Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly. Heudelet's attack at Sochocin was repulsed by three battalions. Furious at this setback, he ordered a second attack which only resulted in more casualties. At Ko≈ÇozƒÖb, Desjardin ordered the 16th Light to line the west bank of the river to give covering fire while the grenadier company of the 14th Line stormed the incompletely demolished bridge. Securing a foothold, the grenadiers were rapidly reinforced and repelled counterattacks by Russian infantry and hussars. Aided by Lapisse's task force which crossed downstream, Desjardin's men drove off the Russians and captured six cannons. Augereau lost 66 men killed and 452 wounded in these two actions.Petre Poland, 84-85 Map of the Battle of Golymin showing the French (blue) and Russian (green) positions at 5:00 PM Two days later, Desjardin fought at the Battle of Go≈Çymin.Smith, 236 In this action, Dmitry Golitsyn with 16,000 to 18,000 Russians held off 37,000 to 38,000 Frenchmen under Marshals Davout and Augereau. The large French numerical advantage was partly offset by the fact that Golitsyn had taken up an excellent defensive position. The Russians also employed 28 pieces of artillery, while the French could get no guns forward because of the poor condition of the roads.Petre Poland, 114 After a cavalry clash, Desjardin's division was the first French infantry to reach the battlefield.Petre Poland, 109 Heudelet's division marched on a different road and took position on Desjardin's left. Repeatedly attacked by cavalry, Heudelet was forced to keep his men in square and consequently could make little forward progress. Desjardin attacked with more verve, pressing back a Russian infantry regiment. Reinforced, the Russians pushed his troops back in turn. Rallying his men, Desjardin ordered a new advance but it was stopped by point-blank artillery fire. After Augereau's advance ended in a stalemate,Petre Poland, 110 Davout's troops appeared on the scene. At first they were successful, but this attack eventually stalled and the Russians retreated that evening in good order.Petre Poland, 111-112 Russian casualties are put at 775, but this may be too low. The French claimed that their losses were the same as their adversaries. On 7 and 8 February, the French and Russian-Prussian armies fought the costly Battle of Eylau. Soult's troops were involved in a hot fight with the Russian rear guard on the 7th. Augereau was ordered to help by moving against the enemy right flank, but his troops were not seriously engaged.Petre Poland, 165-166 At 8:00 AM on the 8th, the VII Corps was brought into the battle line with its left flank at the Preu√üisch Eylau church. Desjardin's division was in the first line and Heudelet's was in the second. This move split Soult's IV Corps, placing the divisions of Claude Legrand and Jean Fran√ßois Leval to Augereau's left and Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire's division to his right.Petre Poland, 178 This day, Augereau was not in good health. He had asked Napoleon for sick leave the evening before, but the emperor talked him into staying on for one more day.Chandler Campaigns, 542 Napol√©on on the Battlefield of Eylau, by Antoine-Jean Gros Around 9:00 AM, Napoleon ordered Soult to attack on the left, but his two divisions were thrown back by the Russians after a terrific struggle.Chandler Campaigns, 541 Fearing that his enemies might crush his left flank, the emperor ordered Augereau and Saint- Hilaire to advance. They were instructed to bear slightly to the right in order to contact Davout's corps, which was beginning to arrive on the right flank. At 10:00 AM, when the troops were set in motion, a blinding snowstorm swept across the field.Petre Poland, 180 Augereau arranged his divisions so that the leading brigade's battalions were deployed in line and the trailing brigade's battalions formed in mobile squares. Historian David G. Chandler suggested that Augereau should have formed his men in battalion columns in the prevailing weather conditions. Saint-Hilaire's division managed to keep a true course, but the VII Corps soon lost its way, veering to the left. Not only did this create a dangerous gap on Augereau's right flank, but it sent his men marching blindly into range of a 70-gun grand battery in the center of the Russian line. When the Russian guns opened up, they began to mow down hundreds of Augereau's hapless infantry. The Russian commander Levin August, Count von Bennigsen, sent his reserves to counterattack the badly disordered French infantry. In the white-out conditions, Russian cavalry appeared out of nowhere and began to cut down the French foot soldiers. Survivors related that their muskets often misfired because of the wet snow. Massacred by artillery and assailed by infantry and cavalry, the VII Corps panicked and fled. As the snowstorm began to abate, Napoleon watched their mob-like flight to the rear. He ordered Murat to lead a massed cavalry charge, which put the Russians back on the defensive and gave Davout time to start pressing back the enemy's left flank. That evening, the acting VII Corps commander Jean Dominique Compans reported that only 700 men were with the colors from each of the divisions. He stated that 30 officers above the rank of chef de bataillon (major) were killed or wounded. Later, Augereau's official report noted that he lost 929 killed and 4,271 wounded, but did not give the number of missing.Petre Poland, 181-182 One of Augereau's aides, lieutenant Marbot believed that only 3,000 men were unwounded out of the 15,000 present for duty on the morning of the 8th.Petre Poland, 184 Soon after, Napoleon dissolved the VII Corps and sent the surviving units to fill out the other army corps.Petre Poland, 227 During the slaughter of his division, Desjardin fell gravely wounded. He was removed to the town of Landsberg (Gorowo Ilaweckie) where he died on 11 February 1807. The name DESJARDINS is inscribed on Column 16 of the Arc de Triomphe in honor of the fallen general.

Description The painting portrays the small businesses and shops of Seventh Avenue in New York City shortly after sunrise. It shows a cloudless sky over a long, red building. A red and blue striped barber pole sits in front of one of the doorways on the right side of the sidewalk, and a green fire hydrant is on the left. The bleak, empty street and storefronts are said to be a representation of the dire state of the city during the Great Depression. Despite the title, Hopper has said that the painting was not necessarily based on a Sunday view. The painting was originally titled Seventh Avenue Shops. The addition of \\"Sunday\\" to the title was \\"tacked on by someone else\\". The image was based on a building nearby Hopper's studio. It is said to be \\"almost a literal translation of Seventh Avenue\\", however a few minor details were changed, like decreasing the size of the doorways and making less clear the letters on the storefront. Provenance It is currently in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art. The piece was originally sold to the Whitney for $2,000. It was purchased with funds from Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney just a few months after it was painted, and would go on to become a part of the Whitney's founding collection.

Perrier was the first to resign from the board of the new institution, in 1966, over the question of training; and in 1969, in what has been called the third schism in French psychoanalytic history, he, along with Piera Aulagnier, Jean-Paul Valabrega, and (a minority of) others broke away from the EFP to set up a fourth group: the Organisation psychanalytique de langue francaise (OPFL).Roudinesco, (1997) p. 317 and p. 339 The first president of the Quatri√®me Groupe, Perrier would eventually resign from it in 1981.

Completed in 1941, she took part in the Channel Dash in early 1942 as flagship of the escort force. Despite this venture to France, the ship spent most of the war in Norwegian waters, escorting German ships and laying minefields. Z29 participated in the indecisive Battle of the Barents Sea at the end of the year, during which she helped to sink a British minesweeper. The ship was damaged during the raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September 1943. Z29 was damaged by British aircraft attacking the battleship in July 1944. The ship escorted troop convoys from northern Norway when the Germans began evacuating the area beginning in October until she began an extensive refit in December. The war ended before the refit was completed and the ship was surrendered to the Allies in Germany. She was allocated to the United States when they divided up the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine in late 1945. Still not fully seaworthy, Z29 was scuttled by the Americans in late 1946. Design and description Wartime Allied recognition manual drawing of the Type 36A destroyer The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936 class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a maximum draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by six Wagner water-tube boilers for a designed speed of . Z29 carried enough fuel oil to give her a range of at . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors.Gr√∂ner, pp. 203‚Äì204 The ship carried four TbtsK C/36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, one forward of the superstructure and three aft. They were designated No. 1 to 4 from front to rear. Her anti- aircraft armament consisted of four C/30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and seven C/30 guns in single mounts. Z29 carried eight above- water torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchger√§t) passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S-Ger√§t sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24/25 radar set above the bridge.Whitley, pp. 68, 71‚Äì72 =Modifications= A FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in 1944‚Äì1945 in lieu of the aft searchlight. During her 1944‚Äì1945 refit, Z29 exchanged her single forward 15 cm gun for a 15 cm LC/38 twin-gun turret as used in her sister ships. This exacerbated the Type 36A's tendency to take water over the bow and reduced their speed to . No. 3 gun was also removed to make room for additional AA guns under the Barbara program. By the end of the war, her anti-aircraft suite consisted of two experimental Ger√§t 58 guns (probably), nine 3.7 cm guns in single and twin mounts and twenty 2 cm weapons in single, twin, and quadruple mounts. Most, if not all, of the 3.7 cm guns were to be the faster-firing Flak M42 model.Whitley, pp. 73‚Äì74 Service history Z29 was ordered from AG Weser (Deschimag) on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W963 on 21 March 1940 and launched on 15 October. The ship commissioned on 25 June 1941 under the command of Korvettenkapit√§n (Lieutenant Commander) Curt Rechel.Koop & Schmolke, pp. 24, 110 After working up, Z29 was one of the escorts for Tirpitz from the Jade Estuary to Trondheim, Norway and returned to Kiel, Germany from 14 to 17 January 1942. The ship sailed on 27 January for Brest, France, as part of the preparations for the Channel Dash.Koop & Schmolke, p. 110 The German ships departed Brest on 11 February, surprising the British, with Z29 leading the formation as the flagship of the F√ºhrer der Zerst√∂rer (Commander of the Destroyer Force), Kapit√§n zur See (Captain) Erich Bey, who commanded the escorts. British attacks on the German ships were generally ineffective until the battleship struck a mine off the mouth of the Scheldt Estuary at 15:30. Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Otto Ciliax, overall commander of the German force, summoned Z29 to take him aboard from the immobilized battleship.Rohwer, p. 143; Whitley, pp. 118‚Äì19 While the destroyer was attempting to close, she accidentally collided with the battleship's stern, damaging her forecastle, but managed to take off Ciliax. Later that day, a 15 cm shell exploded in one of the aft guns, killing one man, severing oil lines, and knocking out the port turbine. Ciliax transferred to the destroyer at 18:25 and Z29 proceeded to Weserm√ºnde for repairs. Tirpitz and her escorts, including Z29, en route to Trondheim, Norway, October 1942 After they were completed, she was part of the screen for the heavy cruiser L√ºtzow from 15 to 26 May as she moved from Germany to Bogen Bay, Norway and laid a minefield in the Skagerrak en route. On 5‚Äì8 September Z29, her sister , and the destroyer laid a minefield in the Kara Strait between the island of Novaya Zemlya and Vaygach Island. Later that month, she participated in Operation Zarin, a minelaying mission off the coast of Novaya Zemlya from 24 to 28 September, together with Admiral Hipper, and her sisters , , and Z30. On 23‚Äì24 October, the ship escorted Tirpitz and the heavy cruiser from Bogen Bay to Trondheim and continued to Copenhagen, Denmark, with Admiral Scheer, before returning to the Altafjord with the light cruiser .Rohwer, p. 197Whitley, p. 142 =Battle of the Barents Sea= On 30 December, L√ºtzow and the heavy cruiser , escorted by six destroyers, including Z29, left Narvik for Operation Regenbogen, an attack on Convoy JW 51B, which was reported by German intelligence to be lightly escorted. Vizeadmiral Oskar Kummetz's plan was to divide his force in half; he would take Admiral Hipper, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z29 and the destroyer north of the convoy to attack it and draw away the escorts. L√ºtzow and three destroyers would then attack the undefended convoy from the south. The three destroyers separated from Admiral Hipper to search for the convoy, which they found on the morning of 31 December. The destroyer spotted them in turn and closed to investigate when the German ships opened fire at a range of .Llewellyn-Jones, p. 93 Obdurate turned away to rejoin the convoy without sustaining any damage and the German ships did not pursue as they had been ordered to rejoin Hipper. The Germans found the minesweeper , which had been detached earlier from the convoy to search for stragglers, as they maneuvered to close with the convoy and the destroyers were ordered to sink her, while Hipper engaged the convoy escorts. This took some time in the poor visibility and Hipper was surprised in the meantime by the British covering force of the light cruisers and . After sinking Bramble, the German destroyers attempted to rejoin Hipper but had no idea that British cruisers were in the area. About this time Z29 lost contact with the other destroyers. The other two destroyers confused Sheffield with Hipper when they spotted each other at range and were surprised when Sheffield opened fire on Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt with every gun she possessed, sinking her with the loss of all hands.Whitley, p. 143 Z29 was one of the escorts for the light cruiser and the damaged Admiral Hipper on 24 January 1943 as they began their voyage to Kiel.

The two ships, with the addition of were assigned to the 4. Zerst√∂rerflotille (4th Destroyer Flotilla) upon their arrival. During Operation Zitonronella, the German raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September, they were tasked with fire support for the troops ashore. During the mission Z29 was hit four times by coastal artillery, killing three crewmen and wounding three others. The ship was one of the escorts for Scharnhorst during Operation Ostfront on 25 December, an attempt to intercept the British Convoy JW 55B that was bound for the Soviet Union. All of the battleship's escorts were detached the following day to increase the likelihood of intercepting the convoy and did not participate in the ensuing Battle of North Cape.Whitley, p. 172 Z29 had her boilers repaired at the beginning of 1944 and remained in Norwegian waters through the rest of the year. On 17 July the ship was strafed by aircraft fighters of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm during Operation Mascot, an attack on the battleship Tirpitz, but only suffered superficial damage. Beginning in October, she escorted convoys during Operation Nordlicht, the evacuation of northern Norway. On 16 December Z29 and Z31 laid a minefield off Honningsvaag.Rohwer, p. 379 A week later, she sailed from Laafjord for Weserm√ºnde to begin a refit that replaced her forward gun with the twin-gun turret and greatly augmented her anti-aircraft armament. The war ended in May 1945, before her refit was completed, and the ship was decommissioned on the 7th.Koop & Schmolke, p. 111 Z29 was allocated to the United States when the Allies divided the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves in late 1945.

Not so far from this place live people who immigrated from coastal areas of Karnataka South of the Sahyadri Mountains. Their settlement is called Hullihakkalu or Muttipura. The village legend Legend has it that at one time, a wealthy landlord, a follower of the Lingayata sect, lived in this village. He had a wife who lost a lot of his wealth in a gambling contest. Dejected, the landlord left the place, which was later settled by a few Havyaka Brahmins. The word Kattinakere means \`the reservoir of the bund\`. The official maps are not up to date and according to records the village is called B Sagadde and the official village boundary lay west of the actual village beyond the reservoir catchment area. It is said that there was a settlement west of the reservoir and which was called Kattinakere. There are some remains of an old settlement there. It is uncertain when the settlement moved to the current location of the village. The name, however, has remained. Temple ruins Some ruins such as a tiger bust, Nandi (Bull God) and other remains of temples can be seen to the west of the village. About 2 km from this place there are ruins of a Shiva temple in the village of Sagadde. The villagers believe that these ruins are of a temple that has now become the Madhukeshwara temple, the only temple in the village. The villagers worship 8 other demigods (Huliyappa, Konanatale Bootappa etc.) during Deepavali and are believed to protect the village. These demigods are worshiped during the Deepavali festival every year. The people tree The village has a prominent people tree held sacred by the villagers. This tree is about tall, has wide branches and is very old. There is a Serpent statue near it which along with the tree is worshiped once a year by every family in the village on Naga Panchami day. Origin of river Dhandavathi Dhandavathi is a tributary of the river Varada. Varada in turn joins the Tungabhadra River and later the Krishna River which finally joins the Bay of Bengal on the East coast of India. The village has a 19 acre water reservoir. The reservoir's overflow canal turns into a creek gathering strength on its way to become the river Dandavathi. Notable animals The villagers breed cattle. They usually are named are called by that name. Tigers wandering in nearby hills once attacked Kaali grazing along with other cattle. Kaali, a seemingly weak cow that had a twisted hanging horn escaped the attack. The exact circumstances are not known but she had part of her back torn off which healed, but she survived. A calm but very strong animal later escaped a cattle center jumping a wall about 6 feet high. The cow was given away as a gift to a nearby villager but would always visit Kattinakere frequently which forced farmers to send it to a cattle center. Another animal fondly remembered by villagers is a dog. He always accompanied villagers walking to a bus terminal 2 km away. He would wait and return only after the bus had left. He would also go to the bus terminal by himself to pick up and accompany people who he knew would come at a regular time. Reservoir There is a large water reservoir that serves as storage for irrigation during summer. The catchment area is significant and with deforestation, there is more water flow to the reservoir. The reservoir has not been cleaned in a long time. During heavy monsoon rains, the canals and reservoir come close to overflowing. There is a stone carved reservoir deity on the bund which is rarely worshiped.

V. Varadarajan, Renuka, Venu Arvind, Kavithalaya Krishnan, Vatsala Rajagopal and Mohan V. Ram portraying supporting roles. That serial was one of the best serials of that time because it revolves around both comedy and romance which was shot in a society named Konar Colony.https://nettv4u.com/about/Tamil/tv- serials/kadhal-pagadai Plot Kadhal Pagadai revolves around middle-class families in Konar Colony, in Chennai, in the late 1990s. The show showcases the struggles revolving in middle-class families and the youngsters love live, through emotional outbursts, with comic reliefs here and there. Though there is no main characters, the story mainly revolves around a family living in Konar Colony. The family is led by Mohanbabu, a clerk in a government office, though his wife Vanja is the one leading the family as the only woman. Mohanbabu younger brother, Rajbabu, is a clerk in a chit fund company. He has a girlfriend named Sithara, who is an orphan. Rajbabu hides this fact from his family, as he want to settle first before marrying Sithara. But Sithara's flashback from her college days involving Ramana, forces Rajbabu to introduce her to his family, and his elder sister, Girija gets an instant dislike for Sithara. Girija comes down to Chennai from Saudi, seeking money from her brothers, to release her husband from jail back in Saudi. At the same time, Rajbabu losses the chitfund money, due to a sinister plan laid by his office peon, Sanjeevi. Ramana comes forward to offer money to help Rajbabu and Sithara but has a condition that Sithara should stay with him in his Cunnor Estate for 10 days. If Sithara stills loves Rajbabu after their mutual stay, Ramana would not trouble them anymore. Having faith in Sithara and desperately in need for money, Rajbabu convinces a reluctant Sithara to go with Ramana. But soon, his faith turns into a possessive behavior and Rajbabu refuses to trust Sithara. Though, this is the main gist of the plot, Kadhal Pagadai also revolves around other families in the Colony. One such family is the ultra rich and arrogant woman who bought the house that she stayed in. A strict old man with 2 daughters, who is the only man in the colony to have a telephone, which irritates him as he has to pass messages to the people in the colony. His elder daughter, Nandhini who loves her neighbour, a mechanic and the duo runs away when her father opposes. A Palakad Brahmin family, who is one of the main comic relief in the show. A disabled helper around the colony, named Ayyappan. A struggling cinema actor, also a fraud, with whom Sithara's friend Sundari was in love with, but breaks up after knowing his fraudulent nature. How all these families overcome their daily challenges? Would Ramana win Sithara's heart? Or would Rajbabu and Sithara unite again? forms the climax. Cast ; Lead Role * Raguman as Ramana * T. V.

He was successful as a lawyer before becoming archbishop, and excelled at diplomacy after that. Samarus was a member of a family of government officials from Trani. A document of 1104 was written by a certain Samarus iudex (judge), probably a relative of his. His relatives Nicholas and Samarus were justiciars at Trani and his father, Rainald, and another relative, Roger, were royal chamberlains.G. A. Loud, The Latin Church in Norman Italy (Cambridge, 2007), 277.P. Oldfield, City and Community in Norman Italy (Oxford, 2009), 230. He himself originally served Bertrand as a notary (1160s?) before becoming archdeacon of the cathedral around 1174. Six documents drawn up by Samarus before his election as archbishop are known. In 1182 he argued before Pope Lucius III his cathedral's case against the clergy of Corato. In light of this and his subsequent success at political manoeuvring, it is probable that his election had more to do with his merits than his connexions. In 1192 Samarus was still on good terms with King Tancred, who donated to him \\"the tithe of the royal revenues at Trani and Barletta\\", a donation confirmed that year by Pope Celestine III.Oldfield (2009), 130. Nevertheless, Samarus supported Queen Constance and the Emperor Henry VI in their claim on the Kingdom of Sicily. He was warmly praised by Henry in a diploma of April 1195, in which the emperor granted imperial protection to the church of Trani and confirmed all its rights and customs since the time of King William (probably William II).Oldfield (2009), 133‚Äì34. In reward for his service to Henry, Samarus also received the lordship of the Jewry of Trani. On a diplomatic mission to Cyprus in 1196 he negotiated commercial privileges for his town's merchants.Loud (2007), 389.

It is the 1053rd Sri Lankan film in the Sinhala cinema. The film has been filmed at a specially built village in a location 'Kalu Visa Pokuna' in Anuradhapura. It is the first Sri Lankan film made without a single main character in Sinhala cinema history. The film screened at 27th Goteborg Film Festival in Sweden on 29 January 2004. Plot A convoy of trucks returns refugees to the ‚ÄúKalu Visa Pokuna‚Äù village. The village had previously been ransacked by the extremists who had killed men, women, and children and buried them in a mass grave. The refugees coming in the trucks are being re-settled in their village. This re- settlement is a Government policy to restore the normal lives of the people ravished by the war. The village lake has been poisoned by the extremists. It has already taken the lives of several well-meaning and innocent individuals. Therefore, the village residents were highly dependent on the water brought from the outside to the village by a water bowzer on a regular basis. To a village dominated by anxiety, poverty and mortal fear, two particular men arrive. One of them is a visitor while the other is a young man from the same village. The visitor is the new headmaster of the village school who has been transferred to this village due to political vengeance. His name is ‚ÄúGunawardane‚Äù school master. The young villager is ‚ÄúArmy Ajith‚Äù. He has deserted the army since he couldn't obtain leave to complete his honeymoon. As ‚ÄúArmy Ajith‚Äù returns home with many presents for his newly wed wife, Komala, she is with another man in her husband's room. At the same time, Gunawardane school master comes to a school with no roof and inhabited only by cows. As Army Ajith meets with an accident after his traumatic encounter with his newly wed, Pema, her lover runs naked across the village and covers his nudity with the red cloth of the village kovil. Looking at all this activity intently is a little child named ‚ÄúUkkuva‚Äù, who had arrived just recently. Ukkuva, a child who witnessed his parents‚Äô death and having lived as a refugee, he has been thrown off a truck as he was taken from one camp to the other. He has thus become a refugee for the second time at ‚ÄúKalu Visa Pokuna‚Äù village. A prisoner who has escaped from the jail hides in ‚ÄúHeen Eki‚Äôs‚Äù house. As she comes to her old home as part of the re-settlement programme, with a life-size glass mirror in her hands, she is startled as the prisoner runs out, smashing the mirror on the way. The prisoner then hides in the village temple, which has been completely deserted since its priests were killed during the attack by the extremists. He later camouflages himself with the dead priests robes and becomes a monk. As ‚ÄúKoragramaya‚Äù, the crippled village headman and Pema engage in various bad dealings, Ukkuva comes under the protection of ‚ÄúGam Bhara Attho‚Äù, whose cloth was used to cover Pema's nudity in a previous incident. ‚ÄúGam Bhara Attho‚Äù is the caretaker of the village kovil and has been blinded by an attack on the village by the extremists. Komala, the woman who had an extra-marital affair with Pema was his daughter and Army Ajith was therefore his son-in-law. After the accident, Komala brings Army Ajith into the village as a mentally diseased patient. The shopkeeper's daughter, ‚ÄúUngi‚Äù, develops an innocent and childish friendship with Ukkuva. A woman called ‚ÄúNGO nona‚Äù, an agent from a Non-Governmental Organization, then comes to this village. She forms an alliance with the Gunawardane school master to do various business, being the only English-speaking individuals in the village. Gunawardane school master entices Ukkuva by showing him some food and molests him. Ukkuva's guardian, Komala, then gets into a brawl with Gunawardane school master. Having no other option to feed Ukkuva, her mentally ill husband and blind father, she gets on the only bus driven by ‚ÄúAssa Peetara‚Äù and going past the village to serve as a sexual worker in the nearby town. Heen Eki's only kin, his sibling brother, is brought in a coffin covered with the national flag and escorted by the army. The alms-giving is paid for by Komala, from the money she earns as a sexual worker, and is given to the priest of the village, a prisoner in hiding. NGO nona gets total control of the village shop, the village bus, the Buddhist scriptures at the temple and Ungi, who performed the rights of attaining-of-age to the schedule of the arrival of the water bowzer. Ungi's father, ‚ÄúPansal Godelle Mudalali‚Äù, the owner of the village shop who later disowns it at the hands of NGO nona, also loses his Kerosene cart to her and becomes her employee. At a later date, this same fate is experienced by ‚ÄúAssa Peetara‚Äù, the driver and owner of the only bus that connects the village with the town. ‚ÄúGam Bhara Attho‚Äù on overhearing of the nature of his daughter's profession from an argument between Komala and Assa Peetara, hangs himself on the rafters of the village kovil. Ukkuva who comes running to tell Komala about her father's death, accidentally steps on a land mine and becomes a cripple. In the aftermath of Gam Bhara Attho's funeral, Ukkuva practices walking using crutches with only one leg. As he does so, Pema comes fast on a bike along with a weapon on his shoulder and dressed as a village guard. He is being watched intently by Komala. Pema comes over to Koragramaya who was in the temple grounds and an argument between them about Koragramaya sexually assaulting Pema's mother and then later even her sister, leads to Pema snatching the sickle from the priest's hand and murdering Koragramaya in the holy ground. Moments before Koragramaya's death, Pema grabs from his hands his appointment letter to the army. As the police come to inspect the death scene, the prisoner hiding in priest's clothes runs into the jungle to escape. His robe gets entangled in the twigs and he runs into the woods, naked. Komala contracts a sexual disease. Ungi is returned to the village by the NGO nona after having been sexually assaulted. As crippled Ukkuva and Ungi, who was forced into woman-hood, are sleeping side by side, Komala leaves her two children and disappears beneath the waves of the poisoned lake. The rain is falling down very hard in the night. Near the mass grave site, Army Ajith re- iterates the verses his father-in-law, ‚ÄúGam Bhara Attho‚Äù, used to say. As the darkness gives way to light, Assa Peethara lights incense sticks in front of the pictures of the gods in his bus.

In the very first trip of the morning, Heen Eki, dressed elegantly, seems to be traveling to the town, as if to take the place of Komala. Assa Peethara looks back down the road. He sees Pema, well dressed for his first day at the new job and running towards the bus. Assa Peethara waits for his arrival. Pema sees Army Ajith and gets angry with having to see someone like him embarking on an important journey. In his anger he spits him on the face and gets on the bus. Army Ajith who looks at the bus starts to laugh hysterically. Almost suddenly his laugh stops and he looks at the audience questioningly....... the scene fades out.

Biography Abbott was born in Derby, England and became a watchmaker there. In 1831 he moved to Manchester and manufactured timepieces and astronomical machinery. In 1844, he was found guilty of obtaining two watches under false pretenses, and was sent to Australia. He arrived in Hobart, Tasmania in 1845, where he eventually again became a maker of watches and clocks. Abbott set up a private observatory where he made astronomical and meteorological observations. He published a number of papers in astronomical journals about comets, transits, and other matters. In an 1863 paper in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, he claimed that the Eta Carinae nebula had changed shape and size since Herschel observed it in the 1830s. This claim was refuted by Richard Proctor in 1871. This almost destroyed his credibility and he ceased publishing papers in European journals in 1873, deciding instead to write popularized astronomy booklets.

He is known for his Odia poem titled \\"Rasakallola\\", which is devoted to Lord Krishna. Among his many literary compositions, \\"Artatrana Chautisa\\" is a reputed one. Dinakrusna's Rasakallola and his standalone compositions including \\"chaupadi\\", \\"prabhati\\", \\"janana\\", \\"chautisa\\", \\"bhajana\\", and \\"malasri\\" are central to the repertoire of Odissi music, the traditional classical music of the state. Biography Born at Munutunia in Balasore district. Famous for his book ‚ÄòRasakallola‚Äô, which describe the Divine Leela of Radha and Krishna and to be a staunch devotee of Lord Jagannath at Puri. Dinakrushna Dasa is an outstanding Odia poet of the medieval Odia literature. Not many details about him are available. He was born in Jaleswar in the State of Odisha and was contemporary of Mukunda Deva (1651‚Äì1686 A.D.) and Divyasingha Deva (1686‚Äì1713 A.D.) the then kings of Odisha. A major part of his life was spent in Puri. His mastery over varied subjects like Sanskrit poetics, grammar, astrology, classical medicine etc., made him a figure of eminence. But his domestic life was fraught with continued poverty and ailments. The ruler of Odisha, the then king of Puri, promised him many allurements provided he wrote a panegyric in the king's honour. The poet rejected all such offers and remained resolute in glorifying only Jagannatha through his writings. It is said that he was inflicted with the leprosy and yet he used to visit the Puri temple of Jagannath and sing his devotional songs in a most moving voice everyday. He spent the last of his days at Ekagharia, Dhenkanal near Bramhni rives. At his death place at the Jagannath temple, which was known constructed on the name of Sarana Srikhetra. Dinakrushna has about 15 poems to his credit, among which the most famous one is Rasakollola. Rasa Binoda, Guna Sagar, Bhaba Samudra, Amruta Sagar, Tattva Sagar, Bhuta Keli, Alankora Bali and Naba Keli are some of his notable creations. He earned a great reputation in writing Chautisa and other lyrical poems about Radha and Krushna. The most recurrent themes of his writings are the glorification and the portrayal of the divine drama of deities he worshipped, viz, Jagannath, Radha and Krishna. Rasakallola has a distinct place in Odia literature for its sheer poetic excellence and mellifluousness. It deals with the amours of Krushna with the maidens of Vraja and consists of 34 melodious cantos and each line of the cantos beings with the initial sound ‚Äò Ka‚Äô, the first consonant in sanscrit and Odia language. The cantos are again musically conditioned according to the Ragas and Raginis (tunes) prevalent in Odisha. Dinakrushna has shown great skill in painting the natural cycle of seasons and seasonal amours and romantic adventures associated with the seasons. Centering round the drama of Radha and Krushna, Dinakrushna has written many songs overflowing with a sort of mystically human and divine love.

It was first published in 1899 and was exceptionally successful, selling around two million copies and making the author a rich man. The novel takes the form of the memoirs of an eighteenth-century gentleman, the Richard Carvel of the title, and runs to eight volumes. It is set partly in Maryland and partly in London, England, during the American revolutionary era. Plot summary Foreword The novel opens with a fictitious foreword, a brief note dated 1876, in which the purported editor of the memoirs, Daniel Clapsaddle Carvel, claims that they are just as his grandfather, Richard Carvel, wrote them, all the more realistic for their imperfections. Volume One The first volume concerns Richard Carvel's boyhood and schooldays. Orphaned at an early age, Richard is raised by his grandfather, Lionel Carvel of Carvel Hall, a wealthy loyalist respected by all sections of the community. Richard describes their way of life, his growing love for his neighbor, Dorothy Manners, and the hostility of his uncle, Grafton Carvel. Richard witnesses a demonstration against a tax collector in Annapolis as a result of the Stamp Act 1765 and grieves his grandfather by his adoption of revolutionary political views. Volume Two Mr Allen, Richard's new tutor, tricks him into deceiving his ailing grandfather. Richard is tormented by the coquettishness of Dorothy. At Richard's eighteenth birthday party, he learns that she is to go to England. Volume Three With the third volume, the main action of the novel begins. Through the scheming of Grafton Carvel and Mr Allen, Richard fights a duel with Lord Comyn. He is wounded, but becomes fast friends with the lord. His grandfather learns that his political opinions are unchanged but forgives him, partly through the intercession of Colonel Washington. After his recovery, Richard is attacked on the road and kidnapped. He is taken aboard a pirate ship, the Black Moll. There is a fight with a brigantine, in which the pirate ship sinks. Volume Four In the fourth volume, the protagonist continues to meet with sudden reversals of fortune. Richard is rescued and befriended by the captain of the brigantine, John Paul, who is sailing to Solway. In Scotland, John Paul is shunned, and vows to turn his back on his country. They take a post chaise to London, and in Windsor meet Horace Walpole. In London they are imprisoned in a sponging-house, from where they are rescued by Lord Comyn and Dorothy. Volume Five Volumes five and six are set in London, where the glamor and corruption of fashionable society forms a contrast with the plain and honest values of the emerging republic, embodied in the protagonist. Richard is introduced to London society, where Dorothy is an admired beauty. He makes friends with Charles James Fox and incurs the enmity of the Duke of Chartersea. Richard declares his love to Dorothy but is rejected. Volume Six Malcolm Fraser Richard risks his life in a wager but survives against the odds. He visits the House of Commons, and hears Edmund Burke and Fox speak. At Vauxhall Gardens he is tricked into a duel with the Duke, while Lord Comyn is injured saving him from a second assailant. Later he hears that his grandfather has died, and that his uncle Grafton has inherited the estate, leaving him penniless. Volume Seven Richard returns to America, where he learns his grandfather had believed him dead. Rejecting Grafton's overtures, he accepts a place as Mr Swain's factor, and for the next few years faithfully tends the Swain estate, Gordon's Pride. In 1774, the discontent among the colonists begins to escalate. Volume Eight The final volume sees the dual, interlinked fruition of the two principal aspects of the novel: the political and the romantic. With the coming of war, Richard sets out to fight for his country. He meets John Paul, now calling himself John Paul Jones, and plans to join the nascent American navy. The early years of the war are represented by a summary by Daniel Clapsaddle Carvel, and Richard's narrative resumes at the start of the North Sea action between the Bonhomme Richard, captained by Jones, and the Serapis. Richard is severely wounded, and Jones arranges for him to be nursed by Dorothy. The end of the book sees Richard back in Maryland as master of Carvel Hall, married to his childhood sweetheart.

Illinois iSchool ‚Äì 20th-century American Bestsellers ‚Äì The Crisis His 'diary' is mentioned in the book. Reception and literary significance The review for the New York Times Saturday Review in July 1899 described Richard Carvel as \\"a notable novel... an event of importance in American fiction\\", going on to say that it was \\"the most extensive piece of semi-historical fiction which has yet come from an American hand... the skill with which the materials have been handled justifies the largeness of the plan\\".New York Times Saturday Review, July 1899 The review in the New York Tribune described the book as \\"a serious historical novel, embracing a romantic courtship and many events on land and sea, in Maryland and in England, which involve famous personages like Washington, Fox and Horace Walpole.\\" The reviewer took issue with the characterization, saying that the principal characters fail \\"to get themselves bodied forth in absolute reality,\\" but concluded that \\"Richard Carvel is a remarkably workmanlike production, considering the present limitations of the author.\\"Quoted in \\"A Tale of Two Winstons\\" in The New Yorker, January 2010 A letter from George Middleton to the New York Times praises Richard Carvel for its dramatic qualities, for its portrayal of past times, and for the character of Dorothy Manners, \\"the most fascinating female character that has appeared in the recent novels\\".From The New York Times, March 10, 1900 In November 1899, Richard Carvel provoked a mild controversy in the pages of the New York Times Saturday Review when an anonymous letter writer pointed out certain similarities between the \\"now famous\\" novel and Hugh Wynne ‚Äì Free Quaker by Silas Weir Mitchell, making a veiled accusation of plagiarism.From The New York Times, November 11 1899 This was rebutted by another correspondent, who pointed out that the first draft of Richard Carvel had been completed five years earlier, two years before the publication of Hugh Wynne.From The New York Times, November 25, 1899 A further letter also drew (unfavorable) comparisons between Churchill's novel and Thackeray's The Virginians.From The New York Times, December 2, 1899 A later assessment considers the authenticity of the narrative the reason for its remarkable success: \\"Richard Carvel (1899) is a romantic historical novel of the American Revolutionary period. Though carefully written, the book has the episodic structure characteristic of Churchill. It became a best seller because of the conscientious research that gave remarkable authenticity to events and characters\\".Answers.com on Winston Churchill Adaptations John Drew as Richard Carvel on Broadway 170px Edward Everett Rose adapted the novel for the stage, and Richard Carvel, the play, appeared on Broadway between September 1900 and January 1901.

When the novel achieved its outstanding success, an enterprising developer turned the house into a 200-room hotel and called it Carvel Hall after the Carvels' country house. The Carvel Hall Hotel became very popular, notably with visiting midshipmen, as it was near the United States Naval Academy.U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Association and Foundation online community 2006 p. 14 However, the house was not the model for the Carvel Hall of the novel, nor for the Carvels' town house.

It was developed starting in 2003 by Hernando Barrag√°n. Barrag√°n started the project at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea. The project is currently developed at the School of Architecture and Design at the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia. Wiring builds on Processing, an open project initiated by Casey Reas and Benjamin Fry, both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab. The documentation was created with software designers and artists in mind. Project experts, intermediate developers, and beginners from around the world share ideas, knowledge and their collective experience as a project community. Wiring makes it easy to create software for controlling devices attached to the electronics board to create all kinds of interactive devices. The concept of developing is to write a few lines of code, connect a few electronic components to the Wiring hardware and observe, for example, that a motion sensor controls a light when a person approaches it, write a few more lines, add another sensor, and see how this light changes when the illumination level in a room decreases. This process is called sketching with hardware; explore ideas quickly, select the more interesting ones, refine and produce prototypes in an iterative process. Software The Wiring IDE is a cross-platform application written in Java which is derived from the IDE made for the Processing programming language. It is designed to introduce programming and sketching with electronics to artists and designers. It includes a code editor with features such as syntax highlighting, brace matching, and automatic indentation capable of compiling and uploading programs to the board with a single click. The Wiring IDE includes a C/C++ library called \\"Wiring\\", which makes common input/output operations much easier. Wiring programs are written in C++. A minimal program requires only two functions: *: a function run once at the start of a program which can be used to define initial environment settings. *: a function called repeatedly until the board is powered off or reset. A typical first program for a developer using a microcontroller is to blink a light-emitting diode (LED) on and off. In the Wiring environment, the user might write a program like this: int ledPin = WLED; // a name for the on-board LED void setup () { pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // configure the pin for digital output } void loop () { digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // turn on the LED delay (1000); // wait one second (1000 milliseconds) digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // turn off the LED delay (1000); // wait one second } When the user clicks the \\"Upload to Wiring hardware\\" button in the IDE, a copy of the code is written to a temporary file including a standard header file at the file beginning, and a simple main function appended. The Wiring IDE uses the GNU toolchain and AVR Libc to compile programs, and uses avrdude to upload programs to the board. Open-source hardware and software The Wiring hardware reference designs are distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 2.5 license and are available on the Wiring Web site. Layout and production files for the Wiring hardware are also available. The source code for the IDE and the hardware library are available and released under the GPLv2 Related projects =Processing= Wiring was based on the original work done on Processing project in MIT. =Arduino and Fritzing= Wiring and Processing have spawned another project, Arduino, which uses the Processing IDE, with a simplified version of the C++ language, as a way to teach artists and designers how to program microcontrollers. There are now two separate hardware projects, Wiring and Arduino, using the Wiring environment and language. Fritzing is another software environment within this family, which supports designers and artists to document their interactive prototypes and to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product.

A cargo net is a type of net. It is usually square or rectangle, but sometimes round, made of thick rope, with cinch ropes extending from the corners, and in some designs, the edges. It is named for its use in transferring cargo to and from ships. Uses =Cargo transfer= Loading cargo secured within a cargo net In shipping, cargo lift nets are used to load and unload cargo. The net is spread out by stevedores, who load the goods onto it. They then attach the cinches to a crane hook. Lifting the hook draws the corners of the net around the cargo. This results in a balanced and secure load which can be safely hoisted. Goods are transferred from one place to another in the construction industry using cargo nets. When used to transfer cargo by helicopter, they are referred to as \\"underslung\\" cargo nets. =Securing loads= Cargo nets are used by the military, and in the shipping industry, to secure loads to prevent them from shifting during transport, as well as to deter theft. =Obstacle courses= Climbing a cargo net As part of obstacle courses, cargo nets are used as flexible ladders. =Playgrounds= Although still used in playgrounds around the world, cargo nets have been subject to criticism due to the hazard of strangulation. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued a notice expressing concern that a child's head can become trapped if the openings are of a particular size. =Marine rescue and ship embarkation= In maritime situations, cargo nets can be slung over the side of a ship to allow passengers stranded in the water to climb aboard to safety. Cargo nets can also be used to transfer troops from a ship to landing craft. =Safety barriers= Especially on ships, cargo nets are used as physical barriers, to prevent individuals from falling through openings or overboard into the sea.

History A merchant of prince of Dhaka who built the mosque as well as his own Dargah Sharif during his lifetime in 1675-1676 AD.It is an Islamic architecture. Now its present condition is good. Shahbaz Khan Mosque situated in the old high court area. In 1950 the Eastern circle of the Pakistan Directorate of Archaeology (DOA) took over both the Haji khwaja Shahbaj Masjid, and the adjacent square mazar. Shah baz khan built the mazar and post. This mosque and tomb, constructed in 1679 by Haji khwaja Shahbaz, a rich merchant of Dhaka, remains the city's most refined mosque. Architecture Dargah of Shahbaz Khan Its high fortified walls and occasional bastions were encroached upon, destruction, defacement of different structures and changes in internal spaces, had put the fort in a sorry state. The two-storied diwan block was partly damaged; bathhouse, niches were filled in, and decorative panels were mostly plastered over. The DOA accomplished a good job in restoring the structure and converting it into a museum in the first place, but the pinkish finish on the exterior, rather than the original lustrous white, fueled debates and controversies. The elegance of its interior bespeaks the patron's wealth. The mosque's interior is divided into three bays by two lateral cusped arches supported by stone piers embedded in the east and west walls. Yet the Directorate restored the do-chala roof on the veranda at the south of the tomb and the decorative features like engaged corner turrets. This appears to be the first use of lateral cusped arches in a Bengali mosque's interior, and was doubtless inspired by imperial mughal architecture. The central Mihrab, particularly noteworthy, is highly ornamented with Cyprus- filled kanjuras, ornate arabesque plastic relief in the spandrels, a cusped arch, and engaged colonettes standing on bulbous floral bases. Due east of the mosque is the small, square, single-domed tomb with engaged turrets at each corner. Attached to the Southside was a low rectangular chamber with a do- chala roof, now collapsed. While the purpose of this room is not clear, it perhaps served as a prototype for the more symmetrical tomb of Khwaja Anwar-i Shahid in Burdwan. It reconstructed the brick podium and provided adequate provision for ablution, plumbing, and sanitation services. The front fa√ßade of the mosque has three arched openings within four slender columns. Historically in Mughal architecture the standard architectural design was having two columns on the east fa√ßade of the mosque, but this mosque has four. It also has four corner turrets, ribbed and engaged. Earlier in it also has four corner turrets, ribbed and engaged. In a way the other two mosques built slightly later than this one bear similar features, but in an improved form. It is something that we now identify as a distinct Mughal style in Bengal. It also worked on other structures, too. It shied away from proper excavation and documentation of the intricate water supply system a network of terracotta pipes, an aqueduct, a water reservoir and several fountains, until recently. Present condition Due to its uninterrupted use and some care and maintenance since then the mosque did not require any renovation. However, in the past, the Department of Archaeology (DOA) have made several unacceptable modifications while carrying out periodic repairs. Like in and around many other heritage structures all over the country, the premises of Shahbaz Khan mosque is occupied by religious groups building illegal structures and extensions to the listed building, ignoring its heritage value that they abuse, building codes and rules, fiercely protecting their possessions.

Archaeologists at work amongst building footings at Little Lon, in 2002. The area was roughly bounded by Lonsdale Street, Spring Street, Stephen Street (later Exhibition Street) and La Trobe Street. Little Lonsdale Street itself ran through the block, and the area was further divided by numerous narrow laneways. In the nineteenth century the area consisted of timber and brick cottages, shops and small factories and was home to an ethnically diverse and generally poor population. Today there are few reminders of the area's former notoriety. Prostitution, petty crime and larrikinism Archaeologist Justin McCarthy suggests that by 1854, only twenty years after Melbourne was established as a city, the area was well established as a notorious \\"red light\\" and slum district. It was associated with prostitution, petty crime and larrikinism.Justin McCarthy (1989) The Commonwealth Block, Melbourne; Archaeological Investigation Report. Volume 1; Historical and Archaeological Report. p.55. Australian Construction Services prepared for The Department of Administrative Services and Telecom Australia The numerous narrow back alleys and small cottages of this area housed, by this time, a growing number of prostitutes, The Argus newspaper at the time complaining of \\"females of the lowest and most disreputable class, who pursued their calling with the lowest and most filthy language and conduct.\\"The Argus, 18 January 1854, cited in Justin McCarthy (1989) Vol. 1, p.55 Prostitution was linked with \\"larrikinism\\" in official reports, as in the following description of the corner of Little Lonsdale and Leichardt Street from 1882: In 1891, Melbourne city's back slums were described by evangelist Henry Varley as \\"a loathsome centre in which crime, gambling hells, opium dens and degraded Chinese abound, and where hundred of licentious and horribly debased men and women are herded like swine\\". These places were \\"a disgrace to any civilized city on earth.\\"Henry Varley (1891) The War between Heaven and Hell, p.12, cited in Graeme Davison. David Dunstan & Chris McConville (Eds) (1985) The Outcasts of Melbourne. p.51. Allen & Unwin, Australia. Fergus Hume's immensely popular The Mystery of a Hansom Cab, written in 1887, described life in a slum in the nearby lanes behind Little Bourke Street, as exposed by its middle class heroes. Writing in 1915, C. J. Dennis's humorous novel The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke spoke of the \\"low, degraded broots\\" (brutes) of Little Lon. A former house built in 1877 at 17 Casselden Place. Originally part of a terrace of six dwellings Little Lon's most opulent brothels tended to face main streets, but were discreetly run. \\"Disorderly\\" or \\"low class\\" brothels tended to be in the narrower laneways behind. Tobacconists, confectionery, cigar and fruit shops in the area also sometimes acted as fronts for prostitution. In the small houses of the laneways, single or small groups of prostitutes also ran the most primitive cottage brothels. For example, the still extant Number 17 Casselden Place was operated by a single Chinese prostitute known as \\"Yokohama\\" (Tiecome Ah Chung) as late as the 1920s.Justin McCarthy (1989) Vol 1, p.95 \\"Madam Brussels\\", facing Lonsdale Street, attracted a wealthy class of clientele, and consequently also greater notoriety, although prostitution itself was not illegal in 19th century Victoria. In 1878 a Select Committee Report on the Prevention of Contagious Diseases included the following evidence about Madam Brussel's brothel at 32-34 Lonsdale Street, from Sergeant James Dalton: Madam Brussels was far from the only elite brothel in the area. In 1867 Police Commissioner Standish introduced the visiting Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, to a brothel run in Stephen Street by Sarah Fraser.John Lahey (1993) Damn You, John Christie! pp. 20‚Äì22. State Library of Victoria, Australia. Other \\"orderly\\" brothels also included those of \\"Scotch Maude\\" and Biddy O‚ÄôConnor.Graeme Davidson, David Dunstan & Chris McConville (Eds) (1985) p.68 In October 1891, the mace of the Victorian parliament was stolen. It was claimed that it had found its way to Annie Wilson's \\"Boccaccio House\\", in the Little Lon district, where it was supposedly used in a mock parliament. It was not recovered.Justin McCarthy (1989) p. 66 The connection between Victoria's politicians and the brothels of Little Lon was reinforced when Chief Secretary Sir Samuel Gillott was revealed to have had ongoing financial dealings with Madam Brussels. Understanding the people of Little Lon Recent writers have emphasized the vibrancy and complexity of Little Lon's population of migrants and itinerant workers, and challenged the stereotype of the area as a miserable slum.See Sharon Lane (1995) Archeological Investigation of the cottage at 17 Casselden Place.

Leicester University Press, Leicester. This also seems to have been born out by the major archaeological studies conducted in the area in 1988 and 2002, which discovered a wide variety of objects from abandoned cesspits and rubbish dumps. Many were typical of domestic use in the nineteenth century, but a number gave indications of a flourishing community and occasionally, prosperity.Justin McCarthy (1989) Vol 1, p.7 Dr. Alan Mayne has commented; \\"Little Lon was clearly not, as the slummer genre would have it, an unstable mishmash of listless and directionless deviants. Nor were its inhabitants passive victims to poverty.\\" By the end of the nineteenth century, the area had become home to a diverse migrant population of Chinese, German Jews, Lebanese and Italians.Alan Mayne (2008) Little Lon Changes in the early twentieth century Leanne Robinson comments that in the early twentieth century the Little Lon district began to change significantly.L. M. Robinson (2009) Madame Brussels: This Moral Pandemonium. P.94. Arcade Publications, Carlton, Australia. Newspapers had increasingly demanded a cleanup of the area, John Norton's The Truth being particularly vocal in its attacks, especially on Madam Brussels, the \\"queen of harlotry.\\" Workshops and small factories increasingly took over the area. Many of the hotels and brothels were gradually being demolished and \\"prostitutes found themselves forced into... areas such as Gore Street and the notorious 'Narrows' around the Fitzroy Town Hall\\"L. M. Robinson (2009) p.93-4 Policemen had greater powers and prostitutes were subject to new laws.Graeme Davidson, David Dunstan & Chris McConville (Eds) (1985) p.87 Around 1914, the buildings between 6 and 34 Lonsdale street, including Madam Brussels former brothel (which had closed in 1907) were demolished and replaced by small factories. However, people continued to live in the area until the 1950s, when much of the district was compulsorily acquired for redevelopment by the Federal Government. In the early 1990s, a former resident of the Little Lon district was interviewed. Marie Hayes lived in her parents' home in Cumberland Place (in the northern half of the district) until she married in 1940. Of Little Lon she said The area today The Oddfellows Hotel, built in 1853, on the corner of Little Lonsdale Street and \\"Madam Brussels Lane\\" (Little Leichardt Street) In the northern half of the district, all buildings and streets were demolished in the late 1950s to make way for Commonwealth buildings.

Biography He was baptised at Shobrooke in Devon on 17 June 1567. He was the third son of Philip Westcote (died 1601) of West Raddon in the parish of Shobrooke, by his wife Katharine Waltham, a daughter of George Waltham of Brenton in the parish of Exminster,Vivian, p.772, pedigree of Waltham of Trehill Devon. In his youth he was a soldier, traveller, and courtier, but in middle age he retired to a country life, probably living at West Raddon with his eldest brother, Robert. In 1624 he held a lease of Thorn Park in the parish of Holcombe Burnell. Westcote interested himself in local antiquities, encouraged by his friendships with fellow Devonshire historians Sir William Pole (1561‚Äì1635) and Tristram Risdon (1580‚Äì1640). He aimed at a description of Devon, following the model of the Survey of Cornwall by Richard Carew (1555‚Äì1620) published in 1602. He was encouraged in his project by Edward Bourchier, 4th Earl of Bath, of Tawstock Court, and compiled two collections: A View of Devonshire, in which, after a general discussion on the history of the county, he gave a topographical account of its condition in about 1630; and the Pedigrees of most of our Devonshire Families, a compilation of genealogical information, deemed by later commentators as inaccurate and unreliable. The two works were published in Exeter in 1845, under the editorship of George Oliver and Pitman Jones. He married Mary Roberts (died 1666), eldest daughter and coheiress of Richard Roberts of Combe Martin, Devon. By her he had one son and heir, Philip Westcott (1614-1647/8),Vivian, p.779 and five daughters. Westcote was buried at Shobrooke, the date of his death being uncertain, as the register of burials between May 1639 and July 1644 is missing.

Her father's guidance to know and become emotionally in tune with her subjects became her artistic guiding principle. =Adulthood= Wyeth's sensitive nature lies beneath \\"her feisty, no-nonsense demeanor\\" attributes which are reflected in the direct yet perceptive depiction of her subjects. By her early 20s, Carolyn Wyeth found her own mode of expression and won exhibition awards and accolades. She lived in her parents Chadds Ford home her entire life and married fellow artist Franceso Joseph Delle Donne (1919‚Äì2007) in 1941. They divorced in 1952. She died in 1994. Her grand-niece, Victoria Wyeth, described her as \\"She was crazy in a really fun way... she had like eight dogs around the house.\\" After her death, her family held an unusual memorial service where her cremated remains \\"went kaboom\\" after being shot into the air in front of her home. Teaching Wyeth taught painting for more than 30 years starting in the 1940s, primarily at Chadds Ford, and also in Maine during the summers. At age 12, Wyeth's nephew Jamie began study in the studio filled with the art work and props of his grandfather. In the morning he studied English and history at his home, and in the afternoon joined other students at the studio, learning fundamentals of drawing and composition. He stated later, \\"She was very restrictive. It wasn‚Äôt interesting, but it was important.\\" Through Wyeth, Jamie developed an interest in working with oil, a medium he enjoyed at a sensory level: the look, smell and feel of it. Style and technique Wyeth found her inspiration for her work in solitude of Chadds Ford. For her, painting was soothing. She followed her own path artistically, yet like her father and brother Andrew she drew from her life and the surroundings of Chadd Ford. Wyeth's work reflects strong design, bold color and nuanced emotion. Wyeth primarily painted still lifes of items that were part of her daily life, like a chair, pumpkin, items in the studio. She also drew landscapes of the woods and fields seen around her home. Wyeth painted about four paintings a year and rarely exhibited. Of her work, Brandywine Museum published: \\"Her paintings reconstruct privates moments from the past and often evoke an air of romance, remembrance and loss.\\" Wyeth passed some of her traits to her nephew. Both prefer to work with oil paint and charcoal. Wyeth enjoys working with animals \\"particularly chickens and dogs\\", as does Jamie. Both also enjoy solitude to work. Carolyn said to Richard Meryman in an interview \\"I think all great stuff comes out of being alone. At the time you may feel lonely, but it's doing something wonderful to you.\\" Exhibitions *\\"Unique Force: The Art of Carolyn Wyeth\\" at the Brandywine River Museum included 40 paintings and drawings, including portraits of family members, including her brother Andrew. It was the first exhibition of her work in 30 years.

The reservoir is formed by the Toorourrong Dam across the Plenty River, and an interbasin transfer. The dam is operated by Melbourne Water and the reservoir forms part of the Melbourne water supply system. Water from the Toorourrong Reservoir flows by aqueduct to the Yan Yean Reservoir. Description The reservoir is formed by an earthen embankment dam across the eastern branch of the Plenty River below the junction with Jacks Creek. The system was constructed in 1883-1885 as an extension of the Yan Yean water system. Water is diverted from Wallaby and Silver Creeks, part of the Murray‚ÄìDarling basin on the northern side of the Great Dividing Range -- via the open, granite-lined Wallaby Aqueduct -- across the Great Dividing Range just east of Mount Disappointment, then into Jacks Creek and into the reservoir. The reservoir acts as a settling basin before the water travels down the Clearwater Channel to Yan Yean. The reservoir catchments are within the Wallaby Creek section of the Kinglake National Park. History The Yan Yean Reservoir, completed in 1857, was Melbourne's first water supply system. In 1879 low dam levels showed that further water sources were necessary to meet increased demand by a growing population. The Wallaby Creek aqueduct was constructed in 1882-1883 to divert water via an interbasin transfer from Wallaby Creek via Jacks Creek and the Plenty River to Yan Yean. The reservoir was constructed in 1883-1885 and linked to Yan Yean by the Clearwater Channel aqueduct, and the Wallaby Creek aqueduct was extended north to harvest Silver Creek. Public Works Department engineer William Thwaites designed most of these works. As water quality in the lower Plenty River had deteriorated, the intake from the river at Yan Yean Reservoir was closed and all water supply was drawn from the closed forest catchments via Toorourrong. The reservoir and associated works are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. Toorourrong Reservoir Park Below the dam wall is the Toorourrong Reservoir Park. The park and surrounding forest were burned in the 2009 Victorian bushfires. The park is now open to the public. http://parkweb.vic.gov.au/explore/parks/toorourrong-reservoir-park In 2011, the City of Whittlesea‚Äôs Bushfires Memorial Working Group selected Toorourrong Reservoir as a site for a memorial to remember the impact of the Victorian bushfires on the local community. There is a platypus watching hide overlooking the reservoir. The Australian Platypus Conservatory was based at the reservoir from 1996 to 2007 and at that time the area supported approximately 30 platypus. The effect of the 2009 fires on the platypus is not currently known.

It is situated between Merredin and Bodallin along the Great Eastern Highway. Originating as a railway siding on the main eastern railway Walgoolan was established in between 1895 and 1899. Land was set aside for a townsite in 1913 and lots were surveyed in 1922. The townsite was gazetted in 1923. The name of the town is Aboriginal in origin and means place where the short bushes grow. Following World War I, nearly 100 settlers took up land in the area, which were cleared and planted with cereal crops, mostly wheat. The town was a thriving community with five schools, tennis courts, a cricket club, Country Women's Association and Wheat Growers Union. Tenders for the construction of a brick and cement hall in the town were called for in 1926. The hall was opened and being used for recitals and other community events the following year. The Westonia Road board held a referendum among the ratepayers to decide whether ¬£500 of funding should be used to purchase the hall. The proposal was carried by a large majority. In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. In 1932, 30,000 emus migrated to the farm land around Walgoolan and nearby Chandler, ravaging crops and destroying fences. The Australian military was deployed to fight these emus at the request of the farmers, in an unsuccessful attempt to lower the population of emus with machine guns. The conflict was named the Emu War. The Great Depression and a succession of droughts took their toll on the area and by 1940 only one shop was left and the townsite was abandoned soon after. By 2010 only 10 families remain in the district. A gazebo was erected in the town in 2010 to commemorate the early settlers and launch the book East of the Fence; the gazebo contains historic photographs and a list of the names of the pioneers.

In Hong Kong, the surname is romanised as Kwan in Cantonese. In Taiwan, the Wade‚ÄìGiles spelling Kuan is used. In Macao, the surname is as Kuan due to the Portuguese influence. 131 ÂÖ≥ 0.100% 137.00 Guangdong In many overseas Chinese communities, both spellings, Kuan and Kwan, as well as Quan, are common. It is also a Vietnamese surname that uses the same character, romanised as Quan. It is Romanized Kwon in Korean. It is also a Japanese surname, Seki (), that uses the same character. The Vietnamese surname, Quan and the Japanese surname, Seki, was derived from the same Chinese character as the Chinese surname (The Japanese Kanji Èñ¢ is a Shinjitai of the Chinese character Èóú). Origin and timeline A number of groups in different geographic areas are believed to have shared the surname in history. *Guan(ÂÖ≥ or Èóú) - meaning is City Gate, or Close the City Gate - originally name for an official, then became a surname. *During the 23rd century BCE, Dongfu (Ëë£Áà∂) was a descendant of the ruler Shuan (ÂèîÂÆâ) in Chifeng within the old Rehe Province of the Khitan state. Dongfu married a daughter of Emperor Yao's tribe, using the surname Dong (Ëë£), which later became the surname Kwan (Èóú). *In 1650 BCE, during the Xia Dynasty, Guan Longfeng (ÈóúÈæçÈÄ¢) was an officer of Jie of Xia's reign. *In 643 BCE, during the Zhou Dynasty, near Mount Xiao within the nation of Jin, the Ji (Âß¨) family used the surname of Dongguan (Êù±Èóú) with region name Dongguan (Êù±Èóú). In China it is common for clans possessing the same surname to live in a village together, with their surname designating the name of the village. Later, the Dongguan (Êù±Èóú) family branched into two surnames: D«íng (Êù±), and Guan (Èóú). Dongguan Wu (Êù±Èóú‰∫î) was an officer of Jin. *In 604 BCE, during the Zhou Dynasty, an officer named Yin Xi (Â∞πÂñú) is reported to have taken the name Guan Yin (ÈóúÂ∞π) as his name in public office, designating Èóú as his surname. Subsequent generations continued to use Èóú as their surname. *The surname Èóú exists among ethnic minorities including the Zhuang people, Mongols, and other various Chinese minorities. *Around 1080 CE, the surname Èóú arrives in the province of Guangdong at Xinhui, five generations later at Kaiping (Hoiping) in Guangdong province. *During the Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234), the surname Èóú has also been founded by the Jurchen people of the Guaerjia. *Near the end of the 19th century (1880s), population pressure on the limited arable land in Kaiping county, mainly along the Tan river, induces the rural poor Èóú to emigrate overseas, largely (~70%) to North America and rest to Southeast Asia.

Career Pole was baptised on 27 August 1561 at Colyton, Devon, the son of William Pole, Esquire (1515‚Äì1587), MP, by his wife Katherine Popham (died 1588), daughter of Alexander Popham of Huntworth, Somerset by his wife Joan Stradling.Parentage according to 1587 brass tablet on monument of William Pole (d.1587) erected by his son the Antiquarian. Katherine was the sister of John Popham (1531‚Äì1607), Lord Chief Justice. In 1560 his father had purchased Shute House, near Colyton and Axminster, Devon. He entered the Inner Temple in 1578, was placed on the Commission of the Peace for Devonshire, served as Sheriff of Devon in 1602‚Äì3, and was MP in 1586 for Bossiney, Cornwall. He was knighted by King James I at Whitehall Palace on 15 February 1606. He paid into the Virginia Company, and was an incorporator of the third Virginia charter. Antiquarian works During his life Pole wrote many unpublished manuscripts containing his researches into the history and antiquities of Devon and the descents of that county's ancient families, their landholdings and heraldry. These documents laid the foundation not only for future historians of the county but also for his contemporaries, such as Tristram Risdon (died 1640) who acknowledged the help he had received from Pole's compilations.Youings, Joyce (1996). \\"Some Early Topographers of Devon and Cornwall\\". In Brayshay, Mark. Topographical Writers in South-West England. University of Exeter Press. p. 61. .

His work was enlarged by his son Sir John Pole, 1st Baronet, \\"who was much addicted also to this ingenuous study\\".Pole, Introduction, p.xi However some, maybe many, of his manuscripts were destroyed at Colcombe Castle during the Civil War. The documents that survived include: *Two folio volumes, which were published in 1791 by his descendant Sir John de la Pole, 6th Baronet (1757-1799), of Shute, MP, under the title Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon. In his introduction to the published volume, the 6th Baronet apologises to the reader for any of his spelling errors in transcribing the handwriting from the manuscripts and states that many of the resulting ambiguities \\"must still be left to the decision of the more informed reader\\".Pole, Introduction, p.xv *A folio volume of deeds, charters, and grants compiled in 1616, a small portion of which was printed privately by Sir Thomas Phillipps under the title \\"Sir William Pole's Copies of Extracts from Old Evidences\\", Mill Hill, c.1840. *A thin folio volume containing heraldry, etc. *A volume of deeds and grants to Tor Abbey Pole's collections were used as source material for their own historical writings by among others, Tristram Risdon (d.1640),\\"from whose lamp I have received light in these my labours\\", Risdon, p.29.

Such a gift had he of rare memory, that he would have recited upon a sudden the descents of most eminent families; from whose lamp I have received light in these my labours. Moreover he had an extraordinary blessing of the Lord; for he saw his childrens' childrens' children.\\" Pole's son, the 1st Baronet, furnished Risdon \\"with many things worth the observation, out of his ample treasury, to polish this work\\".Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.29 Today, Pole's collections are considered to be valuable records of otherwise lost documents, though as Youings wrote in 1996: \\"being a man of his time, the material was largely concerned with the genealogy and landed possessions of Devon's aristocracy and gentry, and he found no place for the rest of society\\". Marriages and children Monument to Pole's first wife, Mary Periham, in the Pole Chapel, Colyton Church, Devon Pole married twice. His first marriage was to Mary Peryam (1567‚Äì1605), one of the four daughters and co-heiresses of Sir William Peryam (1534‚Äì1604), of Fulford House, Shobrooke, Devon, a judge and Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Mary Peryam's first cousin was Jane Peryham (a daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Peryam (1541 ‚Äì c. 1618), brother of Sir William Peryam (d.1604)) who married the diarist Walter Yonge (1579‚Äì1649) of Great House in the parish of Colyton (in which parish also lived Sir William Pole at Colcombe Castle). Thus the wife of the famous Devon historian Sir William Pole was the first cousin of his near neighbour, the famous Devon diarist Walter Yonge; the sons of both men were created baronets. In future the Yonge and Pole families long competed with each other to win one of the two Parliamentary seats of the nearby Rotten Borough of Honiton, of which borough the Yonges were patrons, an electorate which expected to be bought by generous bribes which over time proved exorbitant to candidates. By Mary Peryam he had six sons and six daughters including: *William Pole (d.1586),Vivian, J.L., ed. (1895).

The line has the current timetable number of 891.7 and is an important German railway line. The Nuremberg‚ÄìAnsbach section is used as an alternative route when problems occur for long-distance services between Nuremberg and W√ºrzburg (via Uffenheim) and Nuremberg and Treuchtlingen (via Gunzenhausen) and to relieve the Nuremberg‚ÄìW√ºrzburg railway of some of its freight traffic. History A Bavarian politician, Gustav von Schl√∂r advocated the planning of the line in 1862 during a tour of the route via F√ºrth and Zirndorf to Crailsheim. On 15 May 1875, the Royal Bavarian State Railways (K√∂niglich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen) opened the Nuremberg‚ÄìAnsbach section on a direct route, as the industrialist Lothar von Faber had succeeded in having the route of the line moved closer to his factories in Stein.Ortschronik Zirndorf On 15 June 1875, the line was extended to Domb√ºhl and, on 15 April 1876, to Crailsheim in W√ºrttemberg. Due to the ever-growing traffic, the line between Nuremberg and the border was duplicated by 1888. On 19 May 1972, electrification was completed between Nuremberg and Ansbach and, on 19 May 1985, electrification was extended from Crailsheim to Goldsh√∂fe. On 12 December 2010, operations of line S4 of the Nuremberg S-Bahn network was extended from Nuremberg to Ansbach. For this extension, all intermediate S-Bahn stations were upgraded to provide barrier-free access for the disabled, with the exception of Oberasbach, where planning for the redevelopment had not yet been completed. An additional station at Petersaurach Nord, located between Heilsbronn and Wicklesgreuth, was opened on 12 September 2014. The S-Bahn extension to Domb√ºhl via the reopened Leutershausen-Wiedersbach station, but without its former passing loop, opened in December 2017 and is served every two hours. Route The line leaves Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof to the west, initially running parallel with the lines to Bamberg and to Augsburg. The line crosses the Frankenschnellweg freeway and the connecting tracks to the former main freight yard and the cattle yard and passes through Schweinau, Schweinau station and the industrial area of Tillypark. It then crosses the Ring line (Ringbahn), the S√ºdwesttangente (\\"South-west tangent\\" freeway) and the Main‚ÄìDanube Canal and reaches N√ºrnberg- Stein station, where the Bibert Railway (Bibertbahn) branched off to Unternbibert-R√ºgland until 1986. After the line crosses the Rednitz river, it runs through Unterasbach and Oberasbach and continues between the Bibert river to the north and federal highway B14 to the south through Ro√ütal and Heilsbronn to Wicklesgreuth. There a branch line runs to Windsbach and a siding runs to the United States Army military base at Katterbach. Near Lichtenau forest, the line continues to Sachsen bei Ansbach and from there runs parallel with the Fr√§nkische Rezat and from the Ansbach district of Eyb it runs next to the railway line from Treuchtlingen to Ansbach station. After the station, the line to W√ºrzburg branches off to the northwest, while the line to Crailsheim turns to the southwest to Leutershausen-Wiedersbach, running along the southern edge of Frankenh√∂he (a highland). In Eichholz, the line bends to avoid the R√ºsselholz (a forest) and runs to the north west after a left turn between the forest and the Klosterberg (a mountain) runs to the former railway station of Domb√ºhl. This was the starting point of a line to Rothenburg and Steinach and is still the starting point of for the line to N√∂rdlingen, which is now only used for freight and museum excursions. The line continues under the A 7 and A 66 autobahns, through Schnelldorf station to the Bavaria/ Baden-W√ºrttemberg border, connects near Beuerlbach with the Tauber Valley Railway (Taubertalbahn) and ends in Crailsheim station. =Construction standards= The route is double track and electrified throughout. The line speed between Ansbach and Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof is between 120 and 160 km/h. Regional traffic between Ro√ütal-Wegbr√ºcke and the change of tracks Ro√ütal is restricted to 60 km/h. In addition the stations of N√ºrnberg-Stein, Ro√ütal, Wicklesgreuth, Ansbach and Domb√ºhl are equipped with overtaking tracks. =Stations= The refurbished goods shed of the former station in Ellrichshausen was one of five winners of the Peter-Haag Prize (for the preservation of Baden-W√ºrttemberg rail heritage) in 1989. The shed was built by Georg von Morlok in 1874 and now houses a private automotive museum. =Transport networks= The Nuremberg‚ÄìSchnelldorf section is served by Regionalbahn line R7 and is integrated into the Verkehrsverbund Gro√üraum N√ºrnberg (Greater Nuremberg Transport Association, VGN). Operations In long-distance traffic, InterCity trains runs on the Nuremberg‚ÄìStuttgart‚ÄìKarlsruhe route. From the end of 2017, double-deck Intercity sets have been used for long-distance traffic between Nuremberg and Karlsruhe. In regional traffic, Regional-Express services on the Nuremberg‚ÄìCrailsheim‚ÄìStuttgart route were previously formed of Class 111electric locomotives and Silberling carriages as push-pull trains. In order to avoid capacity bottlenecks, the Silberling carriages were replaced by double-decker wagons with high entrances at the beginning of 2017. The trains of the Nuremberg S-Bahn, which operate between Nuremberg and Domb√ºhl, are operated with class 442 (Bombardier Talent 2) electric multiple units. S-Bahn extension from Ansbach to Domb√ºhl  On 7 October 2009 the Bavarian Ministry of Transport and the Deutsche Bahn signed an agreement to plan to extension of line S4 of the S-Bahn from Ansbach to Domb√ºhl. Construction of the ‚Ç¨5 million project, including the adaptation of the line and signalling and the reopening of Leutershausen-Wiedersbach station, was originally planned to be completed in December 2013, but was delayed until the end of 2017. In the contract for the Nuremberg S-Bahn for the period from December 2017 to December 2029, which was advertised at the end of 2013, the extension of the S-Bahn beyond Ansbach to Domb√ºhl at two-hour intervals was considered.. It was not until June 2016 that an agreement was reached on the infrastructure upgrade needed for the 23 km extension. Of the costs of ‚Ç¨5.5 million, the state of Bavaria will fund ‚Ç¨2.2 million and also contribute to the planning costs. With a symbolic groundbreaking ceremony, construction work was started on 23 March 2017. The two-hour extension of the S-Bahn service requires an extra 170,000 train-kilometres per year to be operated.

The Gro√üer Zschand has no permanent watercourse; during times of snowmelt or after heavy rain, individual, locally limited watercourses and small marshy areas are formed.  History  The Gro√üer Zschand was used in the days before the development of Saxon Switzerland as a trade route between Bohemia and Saxony. At Zeughaus there used to be a customs post. Until the present Bundesstra√üe 172 from Schmilka via Hrensko to Decin had been fully upgraded, the Gro√üer Zschand was used as a transport link from Bad Schandau.:de:Bundesstrasse 172 Salt licks and bear pits are witness to hunting in the region. An educational path, the Fl√∂√üersteig (\\"Rafting Trail\\") begins at the Neumann Mill, running parallel to the Kirnitzsch river to Bad Schandau. In the northern part of the Gro√üer Zschand, under a rock overhang, is a cave, closed with an iron door that acted as an explosive chamber until the end of the Second World War in order to block the valley at this point.Wanderkarte S√§chsische Schweiz - Gro√üer Zschand, 1:10,000, Rolf B√∂hm  Geology  The northern part of the Gro√üer Zschand cuts like a gorge through the surrounding rock and has a moist, cool, cellar-like climate. The southern part, from the Zeughaus (armoury), is a broad valley with forested (spruce monoculture) slopes and their associated rock formations (Thorwalder W√§nde and Partschenh√∂rner).  Economic importance  As well as its historic importance as a trade route between Saxony and Bohemia and its use for hunting, the woods of the Gro√üer Zschand supplied wood until the 1980s and logs were transported into the Kirnitzsch valley. In side ravines traces of old tracks for the transportation of wood are still visible today. The car park by the Neumann Mill was formerly used as a washout area (Ausschwemmplatz) for rafting on the Kirnitzsch river.  National Park  The Gro√üer Zschand is located entirely within the Saxon Switzerland National Park and, from the Zeughaus, in its strictly protected core zone. On the opening of the national park it was intended in future to open a pedestrian border crossing in the Gro√üer Zschand into the Bohemian Switzerland National Park which was opened 10 years later. This has still not come to fruition. As part of the year 2000 trail concept in the national park the Gro√üer Zschand was closed at the Hickelschlucht ravine and so a pedestrian border crossing is no longer possible.

It was connected to the river Yamuna by a natural shallow nullah or drain called the Najafgarh nullah. However, after the 1960s the Flood Control Department of Delhi kept widening the Najafgarh drain in the pretext of saving Delhi from floods and eventually quickly drained the once huge and ecologically rich Najafgarh lake completely. Rainwater accumulating in the Najafgarh lake or jheel basin had been recorded to have occupied more than in many years before its unfortunate draining. Need for recreation of the drained lake With recent advances in ecological understanding it has become clear that draining of this vast lake affected the entire climate of this important region that is India's capital territory of Delhi and its neighborhood, it also led to the underground water-table going down leading to water scarcity for this densely populated region. However, at the time of the draining of the lake in the 1960s or in the decades that followed the issue of destroying the rich wetland ecosystem and wildlife habitat of the lake, its ecological value and its value as a water reservoir recharging the local water table in the dry months and the effect of draining this vast lake on local climate largely went unnoticed and undiscussed as the general public, the media and news agencies or the related environment departments were largely unaware and oblivious of what was happening and its long-term effects. Even now the fact that a vast lake ever existed here in the region and the current need for resurrecting it remains largely an unknown little discussed issue. The complete draining of the lake caused the great loss of a rich wetland ecosystem and wildlife habitat and led to the water-table in the entire region to go down which has in turn led to the area becoming more and more arid. There have been some plans since to at least resurrect a much smaller lake in the area. Most of the Najafgarh jheel basin lands have increased many folds in their value owing to them coming within Delhi, India's capital territory and are under ownership of farmers who may want to make a fast buck selling them to developers who want to convert the former lake basin into housing complexes as has already been happening with major housing colonies coming up in the region. If Najafgarh drain, which was built to drain the original Najafgarh lake or jheel, ever breaches its wide embankments it will flood these developed lands and housing colonies owing to them spread all over the former low lying jheel or lake basin. Pre- draining history: A vast lake Before the unfortunate complete draining of this lake in the 1960s by widening of the Najafgarh Drain by the flood control and irrigation department of Delhi the lake in many years filled up a depression more than in rural Delhi. It had an extremely rich wetland ecosystem forming a refuge for vast quantities of waterbirds and local wildlife. The lake was one of the last habitats of the famed and endangered Siberian crane which has all but vanished from the Indian subcontinent now. Till before independence many British colonial officers and dignitaries came in large parties for waterfowl hunting every season.Najafgarh marsh: \\"The (Najafgarh) marsh was a favored duck-shoot ground of the British, but was eventually drained out into the Najafgarh Nallah.\\" Strategy Framework for Delhi beyond the Commonwealth Games 2010 , BY DANNY CHERIAN, 2004[A Guide to the Birds of the Delhi Area (1975) by Usha Ganguli, a member of the Delhi Birdwatching Society.][Birdwatching Articles from 1961 -70 from Najafgarh lake by Usha Ganguli in \\"Newsletter for Birdwatchers\\" edited by Zafar Futehally] Najafgarh drain or nullah The Najafgarh drain or Najafgarh nullah (nullah in Hindi means drain) is just another name for the River Sahibi which continues its flow through Delhi where it is channelized due to flood control purposes, it is a tributary to River Yamuna in which it outfalls here. Within Delhi it is erroneously called \\"Najafgarh drain\\" or \\"Najafgarh nullah\\"', it gets this name from the once famous and huge Najafgarh Jheel (lake) near the town of Najafgarh in southwest Delhi and within urbanized Delhi it is the Indian Capital's most polluted water body due to direct inflow of untreated sewage from surrounding populated areas. A January 2005 report by the Central Pollution Control Board clubs this drain with 13 other highly polluted wetlands under category ‚Äò‚ÄòD ‚Äô‚Äô for assessing the water quality of wetlands in wildlife habitats.Blot across the Capital: Najafgarh most polluted, Sunday, 10 July 2005, The Indian ExpressEnvironment minister raises a stink over Najafgarh jheel, 22 February 2005, The Indian ExpressNajafgarh basin Delhi‚Äôs most polluted area, 25 December 2009, The Indian ExpressNajafgarh drain 11th among highly polluted industrial clusters, 25 December 2009, The Times of IndiaNajafgarh drain causes less pollution in Yamuna now , 4 July 2006, The Indian Express Bird Sanctuary and wetland ecosystem The drain has been much widened over the years to drain all the water which in earlier decades used to collect in the Nagafgarh Jheel basin this was supposedly done to remove the threat of flooding in DelhiFlood Problem due to Sahibi River, Department of Irrigation and Flood Control, Government of NCT of Delhi, India.URBAN FLOODING AND ITS MANAGEMENT , and now the drain itself acts as an elongated water body or lake with trees planted on both its embankments with an inspection road running on one embankment. During the winter months it attracts wast quantities of migratory birds and also supports local wildlife yearlong. Due to the rich wildlife observed in and around the less polluted stretch of the drain outside of congested populated areas it has been proposed as a Bird Sanctuary for Delhi.DTTDC to develop bird sanctuary near Najafgarh , 12 January 2003, The Indian ExpressMigratory birds are giving Delhi the go-by, 17 January 2010, The HinduNajafgarh jheel may chirp again, 20 August 2006, The Indian Express The wetland ecosystem and wildlife habitat on several kilometers of less polluted Najafgarh drain in rural Delhi before entering the main city including the former Najafgarh lake or Najafgarh jheel area is very important habitat to migratory waterbirds as well as local wildlife and has been earmarked to be declared a bird sanctuary for Delhi. The area came to be recognized as an important wildlife habitat after a local naturalist studying the area during 1986-88 called attention to it recommending it to be conserved as a bird sanctuary after which the Delhi wildlife department posted 16 guards in the area to control illegal bird hunters including diplomats from various international embassies located in Delhi, India's capital. Delhi Administration officials were tasked with declaring about 25km stretch of the drain in rural delhi, including where is passes through the core area of the now drained Najafgarh Lake, \\"protected\\" under the \\"Wildlife Act\\" after Lt.-Governor of Delhi Mr. H.L. Kapur was invited to the area for touring the site where he also heard accounts of local villagers about the rampant illegal hunting of waterbirds that went on here every year. The existing staff of the Flood Control and Irrigation Department numbering about 40 were also given the additional responsibility of protecting the wildlife on and around the drain.[A bird sanctuary for Delhi soon, By Nirupama Subramanian, Express News Service, City, New Delhi, 7 March 1988, Indian Express Newspaper][Flamingos flock to Capital, By N.

Local villagers still alive till the end of last century remembered many cars of British colonial officers congregating at the edge of the lake for duck shoots. In those decades bygone, along with the rich wildlife inhabiting the region here also lived the now presumably extinct famous pink-headed ducks of which records exist of having been shot here by the hunters and bird-watchers recorded the presence of rare Siberian cranes that no more visit India., Siberian crane Grus leucogeranus: Delhi - Najafgarh lake (Najafgarh jheel), undated (Hume and Marshall 1879‚Äì1881)[Book: A Guide to the Birds of the Delhi Area (1975) by Usha Ganguli, a member of the Delhi Birdwatching Society.], [Birdwatching Articles from 1961-75 from wetlads of Najafgarh lake by Usha Ganguli in \\"Newsletter for Birdwatchers\\" edited by Zafar Futehally] Farmlands in the Najafgarh lake basin area an important habitat Farmland with very little disturbance acts as an important bird habitat in the Najafgarh lake basin, even fields lying fallow are used by hundreds of congregating demoiselle cranes and common cranes, pairs of sarus cranes can be seen in the adjoining farmland along the Najafgarh drain. Other resident wild bird and animals also inhabit these farmlands including hares, nilgai, wildcat, common fox, jackal, monitor lizards, various varieties of snakes etc. which also come for shelter into the forested embankments of the drain and disperse into the neighbouring farmland for foraging. Development of major housing colonies in the former Najafgarh lake basin After the complete draining of the lake in the 1960s the former lake basin was converted into farmland first and by now various large scale housing projects occupy the former lake basin including vikaspuri, Uttam Nagar, pappankalan, dwarka etc., the Delhi airport also borders the former lake basin. Land costs have skyrocketed and builders and developers have converged on this area which falls within Delhi, land use is changing from farming to housing colony urban development. However, in case if the Najafgarh Drain ever breaches its man- made and fortified embankments during the monsoon season, large swaths of these housing colonies could be flooded, causing a major disaster.

Life He was the only child of Thomas Hamper of West Tarring, Sussex, and his wife Elizabeth Tyson, born at Birmingham on 12 December 1776. Both parents died in 1811, and were buried in the churchyard of King's Norton Worcestershire. William was brought up in his father's business as a brassfounder, and to extend it he travelled widely. In 1811, he was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Warwickshire. In 1817 he became a correspondent of the Society of Antiquaries, and was elected a Fellow on 5 April 1821. He died suddenly at Highgate, Birmingham, on 3 May 1831, and was buried with his parents. Monuments to their memory are also in King's Norton churchyard. Works He began his literary career by contributing poems to the Gentleman's Magazine the first being ‚ÄòThe Beggar-Boy,‚Äô 1798, p. 794, which was signed ‚ÄòH. D. B.,‚Äô the initial letters of Hamper, Deritend, Birmingham. The best known of these was ‚ÄòThe Devil's Dike, a Sussex Legend‚Äô, which was reprinted in Brighton guide-books. From 1804 to 1812 he sent the same periodical views and descriptions of English churches and other buildings of antiquity. About the same time he composed and published, under the name of ‚ÄòRepmah,‚Äô an anagram of Hamper, some songs and airs. Hamper was well versed in Anglo-Saxon and medieval latinity, and was an accurate facsimilist. John Nichols in his ‚ÄòHistory of Leicestershire,‚Äô George Ormerod in ‚ÄòCheshire,‚Äô William Bray in ‚ÄòSurrey,‚Äô and Edmund Cartwright in ‚ÄòSussex‚Äô acknowledged help from him, and he gave assistance to the anonymous author of ‚ÄòKenilworth Illustrated,‚Äô 1821. Hamper published two separate works: * ‚ÄòObservations on certain Ancient Pillars of Memorial called Hoar-Stones, to which is added a conjecture on the Croyland Inscription,‚Äô Birmingham, 1820; a pamphlet. The materials which he had collected for an enlarged edition were inserted in ‚ÄòArch√¶ologia,‚Äô xxv. 24‚Äì60. * ‚ÄòThe Life, Diary, and Correspondence of Sir William Dugdale‚Äô (1827); pt. ii. of the appendix, consisting of an index to the manuscript collections of Dugdale, was issued separately in 1826. This was Hamper's major work. For many years Hamper was engaged in preparing a new edition of Dugdale's ‚ÄòAntiquities of Warwickshire,‚Äô and collected vast materials. His copy of that volume, with manuscript additions, went to the British Museum. At the sale of his library the firm of Beilby, Knott, & Beilby acquired his notes for a distinct history of Aston and Birmingham. His copy of William Hutton's ‚ÄòBirmingham,‚Äô interleaved and covered with annotations, went to Alderman Avery of Birmingham, and a mass of his letters and manuscripts was in the Staunton Warwickshire collection, which was purchased and presented to the corporation reference library at Birmingham. These were burnt, but many of his letters had been copied and printed in the notes and queries column of the ‚ÄòBirmingham Weekly Post.‚Äô Hamper edited a volume of ‚ÄòMasques performed before Queen Elizabeth. From a coeval copy, Chiswick, 1820,‚Äô which he (wrongly) attributed to George Ferrers; and he printed for private circulation in 1822 ‚ÄòTwo Copies of Verses on the Meeting of Charles the First and Henrietta Maria, in the Valley of Kineton, below Edge-Hill, July 13, 1643,‚Äô which were preserved in manuscript among Dugdale's papers. Many of his communications on rings, seals, and runic inscriptions appeared in ‚ÄòArch√¶ologia,‚Äô vols. xix‚Äìxxv. Notes by him on books are inserted in Thomas Frognall Dibdin's ‚ÄòBibliomania‚Äô (1876, ed.) pp. 117, 529, and in his ‚ÄòBibliographical Decameron,‚Äô iii. 253‚Äì4. From 1812 to 1831 he was an intimate friend and correspondent of John Britton, whom he aided in compiling the ‚ÄòBeauties of England and Wales,‚Äô and the ‚ÄòDictionary of Architecture and Arch√¶ology in the Middle Ages.‚Äô A list of 140 ways of spelling Birmingham, drawn up by Hamper, appears in John Alfred Langford's ‚ÄòCentury of Birmingham Life.‚Äô  Personal life  On 7 November 1803, Hamper married Jane Sharp at Ringwood, Hampshire. Hamper's wife is the youngest daughter of William Sharp of Newport, Isle of Wight, a politician and literary student. They have three daughters. On 6 June 1829, Hamper's wife died.

A White √©migr√©, he lived in China from 1922 until his death. Early life and education Shirokogoroff was born in Suzdal. He went to France in 1906 to study at the University of Paris (Sorbonne) and then the √âcole d'anthropologie.See √âcole d'anthropologie on French Wikipedia He returned to Russia in 1910 to enter the Natural Sciences Department of the Saint Petersburg University, but pursued other interests including archaeology and then anthropology. Under the direction of Vasily Radlov he began studying the ethnography of the Tungusic peoples, participating in expeditions in northeast China and eastern Siberia. Career In 1912, Shirokogoroff started his research of the ethnography of the Manchu people. As Manchus in most of China had by that time long been strongly Sinicized in their language and culture, Shirokogoroff went in 1915 to one of the most remote corner of the country, the Aigun district (now Heihe) on the Amur River, opposite Russia's Blagoveshchensk. The Aigun area until recently had few Chinese settlers, and, despite the dislocations occasioned by the events of 1900, the Manchus there had largely preserved their language and distinct way of life. Shirokogoroff spent 18 months working with the Manchus there. In 1917-1918 he complemented his Aigun field research with a study of the Manchus in Beijing, who had been living there in the Chinese environment since 1644. With the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, Shirokogoroff first stayed in Vladivostok at the Far Eastern University. In 1922 he went to Shanghai on a business trip to get some of his works (including the Social organization of the Manchus) printed, but due to the fall of Vladivostok to the communists in 1922, remained in Shanghai as part of the city's Russian community. Shirokogoroff joined the Academia Sinica's Ethnology section in 1928 under Cai Yuanpei, and along with his wife and Yang Qingkun did fieldwork among the Yi people of Yunnan. He also taught at Fu Jen Catholic University (which later moved to Taipei). Afterwards, he was the first (and for quite some time, only) anthropology professor at Tsinghua University. Administratively, the status of anthropology was in flux for the first few years; the department began as \\"Sociology and Anthropology\\", then changed to \\"Sociology\\"; however, it was an \\"integral part of the department\\". He was the master's thesis advisor for Fei Xiaotong, who arrived at the university in 1933. Fei is best known for his association with Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski, but Fei himself says that Shirokogoroff was more influential in his academic development. Another student of Shirokogoroff's at Tsinghua was Francis Hsu, who had a less favourable view of him, complaining years later of his \\"authoritarian\\" and \\"intimidating\\" personal style. Shirokogoroff also had rather poor relations with fellow expatriates Wilhelm Schmidt and Alfred Radcliffe-Brown. Works and legacy Major works of Shirokogoroff's include Opyt izsliÔ∏†eÔ∏°dovanƒ´iÔ∏†aÔ∏° osnov shamanstva u tungusov ¬´–û–ø—ã—Ç –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤ —à–∞–º–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —É —Ç—É–Ω–≥—É—Å–æ–≤¬ª (1919); ƒñtnos.

He left behind a manuscript of an Evenki dictionary, which his wife conveyed to Yasumoto Tokunaga (later of Kansai Gaidai University) in 1943. However this and other papers of Shirokogoroff's were lost during the Occupation of Japan when the United States Army, Japan took over the building of the Minzoku Kenky≈´sho.See Ê∞ëÊóèÁ†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ on Japanese Wikipedia Later writers described Shirokogoroff as one of the greatest scholars of Tungusic studies.

With her church of God upbringing, and with the sound of everything from ska, reggae, jazz and soul emanating from the family home, Simms' natural love of music was enhanced, and after a brief flirtation with acting during which she attended drama school, her urge to make music began to dominate. Determined, the fourteen-year-old Simms wrote to the local newspaper, the South London Press, and an article about her wanting to become a singer was featured. The musical journey had begun. Musical career Simms first found success as a member of the Lovers rock trio Brown Sugar (which also featured Caron Wheeler and Pauline Catlin). The trio enjoyed unprecedented success, topping the UK reggae charts on three occasions. Brown Sugar's first chart-topper in 1977, \\"I'm in Love With a Dreadlocks\\", was also the first release on the new Lover's Rock record label formed by Dennis Harris, John Kpiaye and Dennis Bovell. The record label title became the adopted definition for the genre of music.

Kofi went on to achieve further awards in 1989, establishing her status as one of the queens of Lovers rock. Kofi had been asked on many occasions to crossover into the soul/R&B; market and she began to pen some of her own work directly aimed at that genre of music. The opportunity arose through association with Jazzie B of the Soul II Soul phenomena. Motown Records had engaged Jazzie B to establish a subsidiary label, Funki Dreds to which he was to find and sign artists of the highest calibre in the UK ‚Äì Kofi was signed to the new label and featured on the 1992 Soul II Soul Volume III ‚Äì Just Right album with the tracks \\"Move Me No Mountain\\" and \\"Future\\".Discogs: Soul II Soul ‚Äì Volume III Just Right, retrieved 28 August 2012. The only single release by Kofi during this period was in 1992 with the song \\"Step By Step\\".Discogs: Kofi ‚Äì Step By Step, retrieved 28 August 2012. During her time with Motown, Kofi was commissioned to work for a mammoth musical project put together by Disney/Buena Vista. The Simply Mad About the Mouse: A Musical Celebration of Imagination project was a musical tribute to the company's many successful movies over the years and as such they marked the occasion by featuring many top-rated artists to each take a very famous song from one of their beloved movies and perform it in their own unique style. This included LL Cool J, Gipsy Kings, Michael Bolton and Billy Joel, to name a few. Kofi's contribution to the project was her rendition of \\"Kiss The Girl\\" from the film The Little Mermaid.Cerone, Daniel (1991), \\"Disney Hopes 'Mouse' Will Roar\\", Los Angeles Times, retrieved 28 August 2012. Kofi went on to work more closely with producers Mafia & Fluxy. As well as the inclusion of songs on a number of compilation albums, in 2008 the album Rocking Eternally was released. The 2011 album Kofi & Friends showcased Kofi in a more roots reggae mood and sharing the album with established reggae artists: Freddie McGregor, Luciano, Michael Rose, George Nooks, Morgan Heritage and Earl Sixteen. During 2011, the film The Story of Lovers Rock, directed by Menelik Shabazz, was publicly released and featured Kofi in conversation and music from Brown Sugar.Abbott, Dianne (2011), \\"And now... The Story Of Lovers' Rock\\", Jamaica Observer, retrieved 27 August 2012.The Story of Lovers Rock film, 2011, 27 August 2012. In 2010 Kofi took up residency in Barbados performing various music styles to meet audience expectations at many hotels and locations around the island. 2012 saw her not only working with new producers, but also the release of a new EP, Sweetness & Thanks, and a number of singles in various genres. The album Rocking Eternally was also re-released. Kofi continues to be a dynamic and audience engaging live entertainer. Notable performances include performing as the closing act at The Giants of Lovers Rock event in 2012 and entertaining at her own special shows \\"Intimate\\" and \\"Kofi & Friends\\" in the UK. During 2013 Kofi appeared alongside Sanchez, John Holt and Frankie Paul at the Barbados Reggae Festival and also appeared at the St Lucia Jazz Festival in the same year. During 2016 Kofi returned to the UK for an indefinite period to complete work on a new album and a number of singles which will reflect her various musical styles with songs in the Soul/R&B;, Reggae and Jazz genres. In April 2017 the \\"Intimate\\" event was developed, with music director Christella Litras, into a new show \\"The Journey\\" and the show included the first public performances of some of the new songs. Launched in Leeds at Seven Arts with two sold out evenings, nine quality musicians, guest singers Rob Green and Marion Zubrzycki from the Caution Collective and solo showcases for the backing singers. Presented by DJ Fluid, with poetic narration by Khadijah Ibrahiim and expressive dancing by Phoenix Dance founder David Hamilton and 12 year old Leilani Storm, the show proved to be a very successful formula.

Jones was an ardent supporter of both the American and French Revolutions ‚Äì his strong support of the Jacobin cause earned him the nickname \\"the rural Voltaire\\" or \\"Welsh Voltaire\\". Despite his support for foreign revolutionary causes, he never advocated an uprising within his own country, instead campaigning to encourage his countrymen to emigrate to the United States. Jones held strong anti-English feelings, which led to one contemporary to describe him as \\"the hottest arsed\\" Welshman he had ever known. Early history Jones was born in 1726 to William Sion Dafydd and his second wife Catherine. His father was a guard on the coach that ran between Machynlleth in Wales and Shrewsbury in England, though he also farmed at Dol Hywel in Llangadfan in Montgomeryshire. Jones, despite his later preaching of the glory of emigration, lived his whole life in Llangadfan. He was christened at Llangadfan parish church on 18 June 1726, and the only formal education he received was at one of Griffith Jones' schools that existed for a time in the neighbourhood.Lloyd (1958) p.523 He was mainly self- educated, and being raised as a Welsh speaker, he learnt English as a second language. His written English was said to be good, though he spoke it with difficulty. He also learnt Latin, and translated works by Horace and Ovid into Welsh. As well as the classics, Jones promoted the ideas of the French philosopher Voltaire in Welsh; in the view of David Barnes in his book The Companion Guide to Wales, this \\"succeeded in influencing the political development of his country\\". Jones was married to Ann, and they had a son and two daughters. His wife suffered terribly from pains of the body and was confined to her bed for the last 15 years of her life. Antiquary Jones began to correspond with the Gwyneddigion Society, and with other contemporary men of letters, and began collecting and recording local folk songs and country dances for Edward Jones (Bardd y Brenin), the King's Bard. Jones spent much time conversing with the elderly members of the community as well as researching manuscripts and printed collections which provided Edward Jones with valuable material for his printed volumes. He describes many of the dances as having \\"sharp twists and turns rendering them fiendishly difficult to perform well\\", and stated that they were probably \\"too fatiguing for the bodies and minds of the present generation, and requiring much skill and activity in the performance\\". He also collected Welsh poetry and made notes on their metre for Owain Myfyr. Jones also began to research and collect the genealogies of the old Welsh families. His descriptions of the parishes of Llangadfan, Llanerfyl and Garth-beibio were published by Gwallter Mechain in a 1796 issue of the Cambrian Register. =Madog ab Owain Gwynedd= In Welsh literary circles during the 18th century, the myth of Madog ab Owain Gwynedd provided an irresistible draw to those seeking a Welsh claim to lands in America. The belief existed that Madog, son of Owain Gwynedd, had travelled to North America in the 12th century and had planted a colony whose descendants, the Madogwys (Padoucas), still spoke the Welsh language. This myth was extremely attractive to Jones, and the publication of John Williams' 1791 work An Enquiry into the Truth of the Tradition, Concerning the Discovery of America, by Prince Madog ab Owen Gwynedd, about the Year, 1170 sent the members of the Gwyneddigion Society into a frenzy of excitement. Jones took these ideas a step further, claiming that Madog, or some of his followers, had travelled further south and discovered Mexico and Peru. Stating that 'Mango Capae' (Manco C√°pac), the legendary first Sapa Inca was a descendant or Madog himself, claiming that 'Mango Capae' was an easy transition to 'Madog ap'. Radicalism Through his research into Welsh history, Jones became more curious about his nation's past, and decided to rescue Welsh historical traditions from the \\"condescension of well-meaning antiquarians and blinkered enthusiasts\\". His views became more and more radicalised over time; he came to dismiss the early Welsh historians such as Geoffrey of Monmouth, whose writings he described as \\"foolish fictions\\". Jones was especially vitriolic towards his English and Scottish contemporaries who he believed 'through prejudice or ignorance, seldom do us justice in their records'. He held particular disdain towards Lord Lyttelton, William Robertson and Tobias Smollett who he felt were hostile to the Welsh princes and failed to acknowledge the suffering of the Welsh prior to the Tudor period. He acknowledged his own temper and confessed that his bore malice against the descendants of the Saxons, refusing to trace the ancestry of English nobles because he believed most of them were descended from a variety of \\"bastards, thieves and robbers\\". His nationalist feelings were appreciated by many of his countrymen, and was admiringly described by one of his contemporaries as \\"the hottest arsed Welshman\\" he had ever known. Jones also tried to gain a separate identity for Wales, and as an antidote to the likes of God save the King and Rule, Britannia!, set about composing a national anthem for Wales. The song he hoped would be sung at meetings and societies across the country. The anthem, sung to the refrain, \\"Ac unwn lawen ganiad ar doriad teg y dydd\\" (And join in joyful song at the fair break of dawn), was designed to commemorate \\"our viscitudes (sic) of Fortune\\". Jones made great play of the treachery and pillage wrought by the Romans, the \\"treacherous\\" Vortigern, \\"that tyrant\\" Edward I and \\"the usurper\\" Henry IV. It is believed that this is the first attempt to produce a national anthem for Wales in Modern history. As well as an anthem, Jones also advocated a national library and a national eisteddfod. Although Jones' nationalism was fuelled by what he saw as an English oppression, he was also acutely aware of the social and economic changes that were affecting the country, which he felt boded ill for the smaller farmer. Since the 1770s, long term leases that once lasted generations, were being replaced by annual tenancies which allowed land owners to change rent levels from year to year. As early as December 1786 he had written to his landlord, Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn rebuking him for employing agents who were 'destitute of the principles of justice [and] moral honesty' and comparing Sir Watkin unfavourably to his father. By the 1790s Jones held a belief that the landed elite, through the use of unscrupulous agents, had forfeited the rights to expect the unquestioning obedience of their tenants, and that the traditional code of conduct had been violated. In writings reminiscent of his hero Voltaire, he declared that society was composed of 'Shearers' and 'Feeders', 'Oppressors' and 'Slaves'. As an open supporter of the American Revolution and later the French Revolution, the British government viewed Jones as a dissident. Orders were made to open and examine his mail, and government spies were ordered to keep him under watch. His views on a broken society, under what he described as William Pitt's 'reign of terror' led him to advocate that broken Welsh tenant farmers should leave Britain and emigrate to the United States. At the Llanrwst eisteddfod in June 1791 Jones distributed copies of an address, titled 'To all Indigenous Cambro-Britons', calling for tenant farmers and impoverished craftsmen to pack their bags, quit Wales and sail to the 'Promised Land' of North America. When Jones heard, in 1792, that Sir William Johnstone Pulteney, had purchased large tracts of land in New York State, he wrote to him expressing his desire to see the creation of a Welsh colony on this estate. Jones though did not endear himself to Sir William, referring to the 'insatiable avarice of the landowners', calling them 'Egyptian taskmasters'. Sir William's response was very negative, he countered that the farmers of Britain lived in the most 'bounteous country in the world' and that if they improved their cultivation methods and became more industrious, then they would prosper. Undeterred Jones then contacted Thomas Pinckney, the American ambassador in London, asking him to lend support in a plan to establish a joint-stock company to survey suitable land in Kentucky and Pennsylvania where a large number of Welsh settlers could establish a new state, whose affairs would be conducted in the Welsh language. Pinckney rebuffed the idea. Despite Jones' desires to see a Welsh colony in America, he himself never emigrated, illness and poverty preventing him from travelling. Neither did his dream of a Welsh colony come to fruition, though his idea of an independent Welsh homeland in America was an important influence on Edward Bebb and Eziekel Hughes, two of the foremost Welsh emigrants who settled in Ohio in the 1790s. Later life and health Jones had long been a herbalist and had succeeded in curing himself of scrofula. He circulated advertisements which proclaimed his ability for healing not only scrofula but also \\"Fistulous and running ulcers, the Fistula Lachrymalis and other disorders of the eyes, glandulous tumours, aedematous and dropsical swellings, white swellings of the joints, rheumatick, fixt and wandering Pains\\". He had planned to publish a book of household remedies; however, these plans, and his career as a healer, were cut short by the Medicine Duties Act of 1785, which obliged him to apply for a licence to operate as a doctor. In his later life Jones was a sorry figure. The lease on Dolhywel had expired, his rent had trebled, and his long- suffering daughter left home to get married. The local absentee rector, Matthew Worthington, believing Jones to be a volatile radical, reportedly did all in his power to turn the locals against him. Jones died in 1795 at the age of 69. He was buried, on his own insistence, in unconsecrated ground within Llangadfan parish church.

Thus, philosophers usually explicate on happiness as either a state of mind, or a life that goes well for the person leading it. Given the pragmatic concern for the attainment of happiness, research in psychology has guided many modern day philosophers in developing their theories.Sturt, Henry. \\"Happiness\\".

In The Republic, Plato asserts that those who are moral are the only ones who may be truly happy. Thus, one must understand the cardinal virtues, particularly justice. Through the thought experiment of the Ring of Gyges, Plato comes to the conclusion that one who abuses power enslaves himself to his appetites, while the man who chooses not to remains rationally in control of himself, and therefore is happy.Joshua Olsen, Plato, Happiness and Justice He also sees a type of happiness stemming from social justice through fulfilling one's social function; since this duty forms happiness, other typically seen sources of happiness such as leisure, wealth, and pleasure are deemed lesser, if not completely false, forms of happiness.Richard D.

Aristotle described eudaimonia (Greek: Œµ·ΩêŒ¥Œ±ŒπŒºŒøŒΩŒØŒ±) as the goal of human thought and action. Eudaimonia is often translated to mean happiness, but some scholars contend that \\"human flourishing\\" may be a more accurate translation.Daniel N. Robinson. (1999). Aristotle's Psychology. Published by Daniel N. Robinson. More specifically, eudaimonia (arete, Greek: ·ºÄœÅŒµœÑŒÆ) refers to an inherently positive and divine state of being in which humanity can actively strive for and achieve. Given that this state is the most positive state for a human to be in, it is often simplified to mean happiness. However, Aristotle's use of the term in Nicomachiean Ethics extends beyond the general sense of happiness.Aristotle., Bartlett, R. C., & Collins, S. D. (2011). Aristotle's Nicomachean ethics. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Within the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle points to the fact that many aims are really only intermediate aims, and are desired only because they make the achievement of higher aims possible.Book I Chapter 1 1094a. Therefore, things such as wealth, intelligence, and courage are valued only in relation to other things, while eudaimonia is the only thing valuable in isolation. Aristotle regarded virtue as necessary for a person to be happy and held that without virtue the most that may be attained is contentment. For Aristotle, achieving virtue involves asking the question \\"how should I be‚Äù rather than \\"what should I do.‚Äù A fully virtuous person is described as achieving eudaimonia, and therefore would be undeniably happy. The acquisition of virtue is the main consideration for Aristotelian Virtue Ethics. Aristotle has been criticized for failing to show that virtue is necessary in the way he claims it to be, and he does not address this moral skepticism.Kraut, Richard, \\"Aristotle's Ethics\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = =Cynicism= Marble statue of Aristotle, created by Romans in 330 BC. The carved busts of Socrates, Antisthenes, Chrysippus, and Epicurus. Antisthenes (c. 445 ‚Äì c. 365 BCE), often regarded as the founder of Cynicism, advocated an ascetic life lived in accordance with virtue. Xenophon testifies that Antisthenes had praised the joy that sprang \\"from out of one's soul,\\"Xenophon, Symposium, iv. 41. and Diogenes La√´rtius relates that Antisthenes was fond of saying: \\"I would rather go mad than feel pleasure.\\"Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, vi. 3 He maintained that virtue was sufficient in itself to ensure happiness, only needing the strength of a Socrates. He, along with all following Cynics, rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, power, and fame, to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, lives.Cynics ‚Äì The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Thus, happiness can be gained through rigorous training (askesis, Greek: ·ºÑœÉŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ) and by living in a way which was natural for humans, rejecting all conventional desires, preferring a simple life free from all possessions. Diogenes of Sinope (c. 412 ‚Äì c. 323 BCE) is most frequently seen as the perfect embodiment of the philosophy. The Stoics themselves saw him as one of the few, if not only, who have had achieved the state of sage. =Cyrenaicism= The Cyrenaics were a school of philosophy established by Aristippus of Cyrene (c. 435 ‚Äì c. 356 BCE). The school asserted that the only good is positive pleasure, and pain is the only evil. They posit that all feeling is momentary so all past and future pleasure have no real existence for an individual, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind. Claudius Aelianus, in his Historical Miscellany,Aelian, Historical Miscellany 14.6 writes about Aristippus: Some immediate pleasures can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them, otherwise pain will result, and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life. =Pyrrhonism= Pyrrhonism was founded by Pyrrho (c. 360 ‚Äì c. 270 BCE), and was the first Western school of philosophical skepticism. The goal of Pyrrhonist practice is to attain the state of ataraxia (ataraxia, Greek: ·ºÄœÑŒ±œÅŒ±ŒæŒØŒ±) ‚Äì freedom from perturbation. Pyrrho identified that what prevented people from attaining ataraxia was their beliefs in non-evident matters, i.e., holding dogmas. To free people from belief the ancient Pyrrhonists developed a variety of skeptical arguments. =Epicureanism= Epicureanism was founded by Epicurus (c. 341 ‚Äì c. 270 BCE). The goal of his philosophy was to attain a state of tranquility (ataraxia, Greek: ·ºÄœÑŒ±œÅŒ±ŒæŒØŒ±) and freedom from fear, as well as absence of bodily pain (aponia, Greek: ·ºÄœÄŒøŒΩŒØŒ±). Toward these ends, Epicurus recommended an ascetic lifestyle, noble friendship, and the avoidance of politics. One aid to achieving happiness is the tetrapharmakos or the four- fold cure: A papyrus copy depicting the Epicurean tetrapharmakos in Philodemus of Gadara's Adversus Sophistas ‚Äì (P.Herc.1005), col. 5 > \\"Do not fear god, > Do not worry about death; > What is good is easy to get, and > What is terrible is easy to endure.\\" > (Philodemus, Herculaneum Papyrus, 1005, 4.9‚Äì14). =Stoicism= Stoicism was a school of philosophy established by Zeno of Citium (c. 334 ‚Äì c. 262 BCE). While Zeno was syncretic in thought, his primary influence were the Cynics, with Crates of Thebes (c. 365 ‚Äì c. 285 BCE) as his mentor. Stoicism is a philosophy of personal ethics that provides a system of logic and views about the natural world.Sharpe, Matthew. \\"Stoic Virtue Ethics.\\" Handbook of Virtue Ethics, 2013, 28‚Äì41. Modern use of the term \\"stoic\\" typically refers not to followers of Stoicism, but to individuals who feel indifferent to experiences of the world, or represses feelings in general.\\"Modern Stoicism  Build The Fire\\". Build The Fire. 9 February 2016. Retrieved 22 June 2016. Given Stoicism's emphasis on feeling indifferent to negativity, it is seen as a path to achieving happiness.Harper, Douglas (November 2001). \\"Online Etymology Dictionary ‚Äì Stoic\\". Retrieved 2 September 2006. Stoics believe that \\"virtue is sufficient for happiness\\".Stoicism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. One who has attained this sense of virtue would become a sage. In the words of Epictetus, this sage would be \\"sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy.\\"Russell, Bertrand. A History of Western Philosophy The Stoics therefore spent their time trying to attain virtue. This would only be achieved if one was to dedicate their life studying Stoic logic, Stoic physics, and Stoic ethics. Stoics describe themselves as \\"living in agreement with nature.‚Äù Certain schools of Stoicism refer to Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia as the goal of practicing Stoic philosophy.Inwood, Brad. \\"Goal and Target in Stoicism\\".

Ancient Rome =School of the Sextii= The School of the Sextii was founded by Quintus Sextius the Elder (fl. 50 BCE). It characterized itself mainly as a philosophical-medical school, blending Pythagorean, Platonic, Cynic, and Stoic elements together. They argued that to achieve happiness, one ought to be vegetarian, have nightly examinations of conscience, and avoid both consumerism and politics,Emily Wilson, The Greatest Empire: A Life of Seneca. Oxford University Press, 2014. p.54-55 and believe that an elusive incorporeal power pervades the body. =Augustine of Hippo= St. Augustine of Hippo (354 ‚Äì 430 AD) was an early Christian theologian and philosopher whose writings influenced the development of Western Christianity and Western philosophy. For St. Augustine, all human actions revolve around love, and the primary problem humans face is the misplacing of love.https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201106/achieving- hapGenesis creation narrativepiness-advice-augustine Only in God can one find happiness, as He is source of happiness. Since humanity was brought forth from God, but has since fallen, one's soul dimly remembers the happiness from when one was with God.R. J. O'Connell, \\"The Enneads and St. Augustine's Image of Happiness.\\" Vigiliae Christianae Vol. 17, No. 3 (Sep., 1963) Thus, if one orients themselves toward the love of God, all other loves will become properly ordered. In this manner, St. Augustine follows the Neoplatonic tradition in asserting that happiness lays in the contemplation of the purely intelligible realm. St. Augustine deals with the concept of happiness directly in his treatises De beata vita and Contra Academicos. =Boethius= Boethius (c. 480‚Äì524 AD) was a philosopher, most famous for writing The Consolation of Philosophy. The work has been described as having had the single most important influence on the Christianity of the Middle Ages and early Renaissance and as the last great work of the Classical Period.Introduction to The Consolation of Philosophy, Oxford World's Classics, 2000. The book describes many themes, but among them he discusses how happiness can be attainable despite changing fortune, while considering the nature of happiness and God. He posits that happiness is acquired by attaining the perfect good, and that perfect good is God. He then concludes that as God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness.Sanderson Beck (1996). Middle Ages =Avicenna= A drawing of Avicenna, 1960. Avicenna (c. 980‚Äì1037), also known as 'Ibn-Sina', was polymath and jurist; he is regarded as one of the most significant thinkers in the Islamic Golden Age. According to him, happiness is the aim of humans, and that real happiness is pure and free from worldly interest. Ultimately, happiness is reached through the conjunction of the human intellect with the separate active intellect. =Al-Ghazali= Al-Ghazali (c. 1058‚Äì1111) was a Muslim theologian, jurist, philosopher, and mystic of Persian descent. Produced near the end of his life, al-Ghazali wrote The Alchemy of Happiness (Kimiya-yi Sa'ƒÅdat, ().Bowering, Gerhard. \\"[Untitled].\\" Rev. of The Alchemy of Happiness Translated by Claud Feild and Revised by Elton L. Daniel. Journal of Near Eastern Studies July 1995: 227‚Äì28. Print In the work, he emphasizes the importance of observing the ritual requirements of Islam, the actions that would lead to salvation, and the avoidance of sin. Only by exercising the human faculty of reason ‚Äì a God-given ability ‚Äì can one transform the soul from worldliness to complete devotion to God, the ultimate happiness.Bodman Jr., Herbert L. \\"(untitled).\\" Rev. of The Alchemy of Happiness Translated by Claud Feild and Revised by Elton L. Daniel. Journal of World History Fall 1993: 336‚Äì38. Print. According to Al-Ghazali, there are four main constituents of happiness: self-knowledge, knowledge of God, knowledge of this world as it really is, and the knowledge of the next world as it really is. =Maimonides= Maimonides (c. 1135‚Äì1204) was a Jewish philosopher and astronomer,Maimonides: Ab≈´  øImrƒÅn M≈´sƒÅ [Moses] ibn  øUbayd AllƒÅh [Maym≈´n] al‚ÄêQur·π≠ubƒ´ who became one of the most prolific and influential Torah scholars and physicians.A Biographical and Historiographical Critique of Moses Maimonides He writes that happiness is ultimately and essentially intellectual. =Thomas Aquinas= St. Thomas Aquinas (1225 ‚Äì 1274 AD) was a philosopher and theologian, who became a Doctor of the Church in 1323. His system syncretized Aristotelianism and Catholic theology within his Summa Theologica. The first part of the second part is divided into 114 articles, the first five deal explicitly with the happiness of humans. He states that happiness is achieved by cultivating several intellectual and moral virtues, which enable us to understand the nature of happiness and motivate us to seek it in a reliable and consistent way. Yet, one will be unable to find the greatest happiness in this life, because final happiness consists in a supernatural union with God.ST, I-II, Q. 2, art. 8. As such, man's happiness does not consist of wealth, status, pleasure, or in any created good at all. Most goods do not have a necessary connection to happiness, since the ultimate object of man's will, can only be found in God, who is the source of all good. Early Modern = Michel de Montaigne = Michel de Montaigne (1533‚Äì1592) was a French philosopher. Influenced by Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity, alongside the conviction of the separation of public and private spheres of life, Montaigne writes that happiness is a subjective state of mind and that satisfaction differs from person to person. He continues by acknowledging that one must be allowed a private sphere of life to realize those particular attempts of happiness without the interference of society. =Jeremy Bentham= Jeremy Bentham (1748‚Äì1832) was a British philosopher, jurist, and social reformer. He is regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism. His particular brand of utilitarianism indicated that the most moral action is that which causes the highest amount of utility, where defined utility as the aggregate pleasure after deducting suffering of all involved in any action. Happiness, therefore, is the experience of pleasure and the lack of pain. Actions which do not promote the greatest happiness is morally wrong ‚Äì such as ascetic sacrifice. This manner of thinking permits the possibility of a calculator to measure happiness and moral value. =Arthur Schopenhauer= Arthur Schopenhauer (1788‚Äì1860) was a German philosopher. His philosophy express that egotistical acts are those that are guided by self- interest, desire for pleasure or happiness, whereas only compassion can be a moral act. Schopenhauer explains happiness in terms of a wish that is satisfied, which in turn gives rise to a new wish. And the absence of satisfaction is suffering, which results in an empty longing. He also links happiness with the movement of time, as we feel happy when time moves faster and feel sad when time slows down.Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Idea. Cologne 1997, Volume One, ¬ß52th. Contemporary =W≈Çadys≈Çaw Tatarkiewicz= W≈Çadys≈Çaw Tatarkiewicz (1886‚Äì1980) was a Polish philosopher, historian of philosophy, historian of art, esthetician, and ethicist.\\"W≈Çadys≈Çaw Tatarkiewicz,\\" Encyklopedia Polski, p. 686. For Tatarkiewicz, happiness is a fundamental ethical category. =Herbert Marcuse= Herbert Marcuse (1898‚Äì1979) was a German-American philosopher, sociologist, and political theorist, associated with the Frankfurt School of critical theory. In his 1937 essay 'The Affirmative Character of Culture,' he suggests culture develops tension within the structure of society, and in that tension can challenge the current social order. If it separates itself from the everyday world, the demand for happiness will cease to be external, and begin to become an object of spiritual contemplation. In the One-Dimensional Man, his criticism of consumerism suggests that the current system is one that claims to be democratic, but is authoritarian in character, as only a few individuals dictate the perceptions of freedom by only allowing certain choices of happiness to be available for purchase. He further suggests that the conception that 'happiness can be bought' is one that is psychologically damaging. =Viktor Frankl= Viktor Frankl (1905‚Äì1997) was an Austrian neurologist, psychiatrist, Holocaust survivor and founder of logotherapy. His philosophy revolved around the emphasis on meaning, the value of suffering, and responsibility to something greater than the self; only if one encounters those questions can one be happy. =Robert Nozick= Robert Nozick (1938‚Äì2002) was an American philosopher and professor at Harvard University. He is best known for his political philosophy, but he proposed two thought experiments directly tied to issues on Philosophy of Happiness. In his 1974 book, Anarchy, State, Utopia, he proposed a thought experiment where one is given the option to enter a machine that would give the maximum amount of unending hedonistic pleasure for the entirety of one's life. The machine described in his thought experiment is often described as the \\"Experience Machine.\\" The machine works by giving the participant connected to it the sensation of any experience they desired and is said to produce sensations that are indistinguishable from real life experiences.Crisp, Roger. \\"Hedonism Reconsidered\\". Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, vol. 73, no. 3, 2006, pp. 619‚Äì645. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/40041013. Accessed 18 February 2020. Nozick outlined the ‚Äúutility monster‚Äù thought experiment as an attempted criticism to utilitarianism. Utilitarian ethics provides guidance for acting morally, but also to maximizing happiness. The utility monster is a hypothetical being that generates extreme amount of theoretical pleasure units compared to the average person. Consider a situation such as the utility monster receiving fifty units of pleasure from eating a cake versus forty other people receiving only one unit of pleasure per cake eaten. Although each individual receives the same treatment or good, the utility monster somehow generates more than all the other people combined. Given many utilitarian commitments to maximizing utility related to pleasure, the thought experiment is meant to force utilitarians to commit themselves to feeding the utility monster instead of a mass of other people, despite our general intuitions insisting otherwise. The criticism essentially comes in the form of a reductio ad absurdum criticism by showing that utilitarians adopt a view that is absurd to our moral intuitions, specifically that we should consider the utility monster with much more regard than a number of other people.Sridharan, Vishnu. \\"Utility Monsters and the Distribution of Dharmas: A Reply to Charles Goodman\\". Philosophy East and West, vol. 66, no. 2, 2016, pp. 650‚Äì652., www.jstor.org/stable/43830917. Accessed 11 March 2020. =Happiness research= Happiness research is the quantitative and theoretical study of happiness, positive and negative affect, well-being, quality of life, life satisfaction and related concepts. It is especially influenced by psychologists, but also sociologists and economists have contributed. The tracking of Gross National Happiness or the satisfaction of life grow increasingly popular as the economics of happiness challenges traditional economic aims.Richard Layard, 2006. \\"Happiness and Public Policy: A Challenge to the Profession,\\" Economic Journal, 116(510), Conference Papers, pp. C24-C33. Richard Layard has been very influential in this area. He has shown that mental illness is the main cause of unhappiness. Other, more influential researchers are Ed Diener, Ruut Veenhoven and Daniel Kahneman. =Sonja Lyubomirsky= Sonja Lyubomirsky asserted in her 2007 book, The How of Happiness, that happiness is 50 percent genetically determined (based on twin studies),Sonja Lyubomirsky, David Schkade and Kennon M. Sheldon, \\"Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change,\\" Review of General Psychology, Vol. 9, No. 2, 111‚Äì131, 2005 10 percent circumstantial, and 40 percent subject to self- control.http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594201486,00.html Lyubomirsky suggests a twelve-point program to maximize the final 40 percent. Cultures not seeking to maximise happiness Not all cultures seek to maximise happiness,See the work of Jeanne TsaiSee Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness#Meaning of \\"happiness\\" ref. the meaning of the US Declaration of Independence phrase and some cultures are averse to happiness.Also June Gruber http://www.gruberpeplab.com/people.php#director suggests that seeking happiness can have negative effects, such as failed over-high expectations, http://gruberpeplab.com/research.php and instead advocates a more open stance to all emotions. https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2018/jul/20/the-dark-side-of- happiness-science-weekly-podcast Other research has analysed possible trade- offs between happiness and meaning in life.https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2013.830764 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2015.1117129?src=recsys https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-differences-between- happiness-and-meaning-in-life/ Those not seeking to maximize happiness are in contrast to the moral theory of utilitarianism which states our ethical obligation is to maximize the net amount of happiness/pleasure in the world, considering all moral agents with equal regard.

The 123d is equipped with the F-15C Eagle. The squadron is a descendant organization of the 123d Observation Squadron formed on 30 July 1940. It was activated on 18 April 1941. The squadron is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. History =Oregon National Guard= Allocated to the Oregon National Guard in 1940, activated on 18 April 1941 at Portland Municipal Airport. The newly formed unit began operations with two officers, 108 enlisted men and two aircraft, a North American BC-1A (like the AT-6) and a Douglas O-46A. The squadron flew observation missions primarily along the Pacific Coast and occasionally made mail flights. =World War II= Ordered to active service in September 1941 as part of the pre-World War II buildup of the United States Army Air Corps and assigned to the 70th Observation Group, Fourth Air Force. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, flew anti- submarine patrols along the Pacific Coast from airfields in Oregon and Washington, later becoming part of the air defense forces of Southern California. This included one of the first missions flown from a U.S. base on 7 December 1941. Flew anti-submarine patrols until mid-1943 when the mission was turned over to the United States Navy. Reassigned to Third Air Force, sent first to Texas then to Oklahoma being trained for combat reconnaissance and aerial photography to support Army ground forces. Was deployed to Fourteenth Air Force in China as part of the China Burma India Theater, engaged in unarmed observation flights over Japanese-held territory supporting Chinese Nationalist forces. Flew B-25 Mitchells, A-20 Havocs and DB-7 Boston Havocs originally built for the RAF. Flew from rough and remote airfields in China throughout the rest of the War, later flying unarmed high-speed long-range P-38 Lightnings and F-5 Reconnaissance Lightnings. The squadron received credit for participation in seven campaigns in World War II. Not all 123d personnel served with the 35th PRS, as some were diverted to other units as early as 1942 and served elsewhere in the Pacific and in Europe. As part of the large drawdown of forces after the war, the 35th PRS inactivated on 7 November 1945, at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. =Oregon Air National Guard= The wartime squadron, designated the 35th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron redesignated as the 123d Fighter Squadron, Single Engine and was allotted to the Oregon Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Portland Municipal Airport, Oregon, and was extended federal recognition on 26 June 1946 by the National Guard Bureau. The 123d Fighter Squadron was bestowed the history, honors, and colors of the 35th PRS. The 123d FS was assigned to the 142d Fighter Group at Portland Municipal Airport. Thus the 142d FG began fighter operations for the first time in the North American F-51D Mustang with 75 officers and 800 enlisted men. The unit was allotted to Continental Air Command, with a mission of the air defense of the State of Oregon. Korean War activation The squadron was called to active duty on 10 February 1951 as a result of the Korean War. It was redesignated the 123d Fighter- Interceptor Squadron and assigned to the 325th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, which was stationed at McChord Air Force Base, Washington, although the squadron remained at Portland Municipal Airport. However, Air Defense Command was experiencing difficulty under the existing wing base organizational structure in deploying its fighter squadrons to best advantage.Grant, C.L., The Development of Continental Air Defense to 1 September 1954, (1961), USAF Historical Study No. 126, p. 33 As a result, in February 1952 the 123d was assigned to the 4704th Defense Wing, which was organized on a regional basis. The squadron conducted air interception training missions with its F-51s until June 1952 when it was re-equipped with the F-86F Sabre daylight interceptor.Cornett & Johnson, p. 122 On 1 November 1952, the 123rd was released back to the Oregon ANG and its personnel, mission and equipment were absorbed by the newly activated 357th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. Cold War F-101B-105-MC Voodoo fighter (s/n 58-0270) from the 123rd Fighter- Interceptor Squadron, 1974. Re-formed as part of the 142d Fighter-Interceptor Group, retaining F-86F Sabres. It resumed its peacetime mission of the air defense of Oregon. Was upgraded by ADC in 1955 to the dedicated F-94A Starfire all-weather interceptor. With this new aircraft, the mission of the 123d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron changed from day interceptor to day and night all-weather interceptor. In 1957 the 123d again upgraded to the improved F-89J Scorpion then in 1966 to the supersonic F-102A Delta Dagger. In the summer of 1958, the 142d implemented the ADC Runway Alert Program, in which interceptors of the 123d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron were committed to a five-minute runway alert 24/7/365. The runway alert continues to this day. In 1972 it received the Mach-2 F-101B Voodoo. As an example of the unit's readiness and capability, in 1976, the unit won top honors at a pair of Aerospace Defense Command (ADC) competitions, the Weapons Loading Competition and the famous William Tell Air Defense Competition. In William Tell 1976, the 142nd garnered first place in the F-101 category and Lt. Col. Don Tonole and Maj. Brad Newell captured the overall \\"Top Gun\\" title flying the McDonnell F-101B Voodoo. 3 X MiG Killer 123d FIS McDonnell F-4C-23-MC Phantom 64-0776, 123d FIS, About 1988 After the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command in 1979 and the reassignment to Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), the 123d began receiving F-4C Phantom II aircraft used in the interceptor mission beginning in 1981. Success came again at William Tell 1984 when the unit placed first in the F-4 category flying the McDonnell-Douglas F-4C Phantom II and beat many of its F-15 Eagle and F-106 Delta Dart rivals in the overall competition. Majors Ron Moore and Bill Dejager were the overall F-4 \\"Top Guns\\" of the competition. In 1985, as part of the retirement of the F-4C from the inventory, the Oregon Air National Guard began to receive F-15A Eagles from active-duty units receiving the upgraded F-15C. Since the end of the Cold War, the 142d has served as the principal air defense unit of the Pacific Northwest. In 1992, as part of a large USAF reorganization, both the group and squadron were re-designated yet again as the 142d Fighter Group and the 123d Fighter Squadron, respectively. In 1995 the group was elevated to wing status, beginning its current designation as the 142d Fighter Wing. The wing participated in a wide variety of expeditionary and humanitarian assistance missions in the turbulent post- Cold War environment while providing air defense of the Pacific Northwest. These included major deployments to Turkey in 1998 for Operation Northern Watch and to Saudi Arabia in 2000 for Operation Southern Watch, patrolling the no-fly zones then in place over Iraq. The wing deployed aircraft to Panama in 1998 in support of counter=drug missions, helping stem the flow of the drug trade by air. Wing personnel deployed on various other missions, sending medical troops to Belize, civil engineers to Macedonia, and to such places around the globe as Cura√ßao, Denmark, Germany, Guam, Kuwait, Spain and the United Kingdom. Global War on Terrorism Exercise IRON FALCON to the United Arab Emirates Air Warfare Center on 2 October 2010. On 11 September 2001, the wing was one of the first units to respond to terrorist attacks on the east coast with increased air defense to enhance security on the west coast, and subsequently participated in Operation Noble Eagle, the national military response to homeland defense. In the 50th Year of William Tell Anniversary Competition held in 2004, the 142d Fighter Wing was rated first in Maintenance, Element Attack and Gun categories. These William Tell successes demonstrate Oregon's long history of excellent performance and readiness to accomplish the real world mission. In 2004, unit personnel provided humanitarian aid in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the 2007 floods in Vernonia, Oregon. The wing also supported ongoing contingency operations in Southwest Asia, including Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, such as in the 2004 deployment of medical personnel to Qatar and the 2009 deployment of Security Forces Squadron personnel to Iraq. In 2005, the early 1970s F-15A model were retired and the squadron received its current aircraft, the F-15C Eagle. With more than 1,000 officers and airmen, the 142d Fighter Wing guards the Pacific Northwest skies from northern California to the Canada‚ÄìUS border, on 24-hour Air Sovereignty Alert as part of Air Combat Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The wing also stands ready to participate in state and federal contingency missions as required. In August 2010, two F-15 Eagles from this wing were dispatched in response to an airspace violation while the President visited Seattle, Washington. The jets produced two sonic booms over the Seattle skyline, the civilian Cessna 182 left restricted airspace before the jets arrived. In August 2018, a Horizon Airlines Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 was stolen from Sea-Tac Int'l Airport by a mechanic. The plane was airborne for about an hour, and during that time performed several stunt maneuvers including a barrel roll. Two F-15C Eagles scrambled to intercept this aircraft to ensure it did not fly over any populated areas. They maintained communication with the pilot during his time in the air, but within minutes of their intercept, the plane nosedived and crashed into nearby Ketron Island, a sparsely populated island in the Puget Sound. There were no passengers or crew on board the plane, and the pilot was killed in the crash. =Lineage= Legacy 123d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron emblem from the 1950s. * Designated 123d Observation Squadron, and allotted to Oregon National Guard, on 30 July 1940 : Activated on 18 April 1941 : Ordered to active service on 15 September 1941 : Redesignated: 123d Observation Squadron (Light) on 13 January 1942 : Redesignated: 123d Observation Squadron on 4 July 1942 : Redesignated: 123d Reconnaissance Squadron (Bombardment) on 2 April 1943 : Redesignated: 35th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron on 11 August 1943 : Inactivated on 7 November 1945 * Redesignated 123d Fighter Squadron and allotted to Oregon ANG 24 May 1946 : Extended federal recognition on 26 June 1946 : Federalized and placed on active duty, 10 February 1951 : Released from active duty and returned to Oregon state control, 1 November 1952 : Re-designated: 123d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 1 November 1952 : Re-designated: 123d Fighter Squadron 31 March 1992. =Assignments= * Oregon National Guard, 18 April 1941 * 70th Observation (later Reconnaissance) Group, 15 September 1941 * 77th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, 11 August 1943 : Attached to 70th Tactical Reconnaissance Group to 31 October 1943 * III Reconnaissance (later Tactical Air) Command, 30 November 1943 * AAF, India-Burma Sector, 5 May 1944 * Fourteenth Air Force, c.

It has been earmarked to be declared a bird sanctuary for Delhi. The area came to be recognised as an important wildlife habitat after a local naturalist studying the area during 1986 to 1989 called attention to it, recommending it to be conserved as a bird sanctuary. After this, the Delhi wildlife department posted 16 guards in the area to control illegal bird hunters, including diplomats from various international embassies located in Delhi, India's capital. Delhi Administration officials were tasked with declaring about 25 km stretch of the drain in rural Delhi, including where it passes through the core area of the now drained Najafgarh Lake or jheel, protected under the Wildlife Act after Lt. Governor of Delhi Mr. H.L. Kapur was invited to the area for touring the site where he also heard accounts of local villagers about the rampant illegal hunting of waterbirds that went on here every year. The existing staff of the Flood Control and Irrigation Department, numbering about 40, were also given the additional responsibility of protecting the wildlife on and around the drain.[A bird sanctuary for Delhi soon, By Nirupama Subramanian, Express News Service, City, New Delhi, 7 March 1988, Indian Express Newspaper][Flamingos flock to Capital, By N.

The 51 km-long Najafgarh drain starts at Dhansa and joins the Yamuna river near Wazirabad. 30 kilometres of the drain is in rural Delhi. With the help of the Irrigation and Flood Control Department of the Delhi Government, the drain was de-silted to increase its storage capacity. Regulators at Kakraula and Dhansa retain the water. Presently the brackish water is improving with dilution. By retaining the water in the drain, the aquifers and groundwater table have been recharged and there is more water now for irrigation, enabling farmers 6 kilometres away from the drain to grow crops.

Historically during the 1960s and before, the rain-fed Sahibi River which originates in Jaipur District. of Rajasthan passing through Alwar District. in Rajasthan and Gurgaon District. in Haryana entered U.T. of Delhi near Dhansa and spilled its overflow in the Najafgarh Jheel (lake) basin creating a seasonal lake, a vast area more than 300sq km was submerged in some seasons, this water then continued to flow on the other side forming a tributary and outfalled into River Yamuna. In the following decades this Sahibi River flow reaching Dhansa regulators was channelised by digging out a wide drain and connecting it directly to the River Yamuna, this in effect also completely drained off the seasonal Najafgarh Jheel which used to form here in the past. The drain channel from Dhansa regulators to Keshopur Bus Depot on Outer Ring Road is wide with thick and high embankments, vast amount of water is retained in this widened drain by closing the Kakrola regulators under Najafgarh Road to recharge the local ground watertable hence it acts like an elongated lake as well.Flood Problem due to Sahibi River, Department of Irrigation and Flood Control, Government of NCT of Delhi, India. Website Last Updated : 3 May 2010, A sewage drain is now called the Yamuna, By Sonu Jain, 27 Mar 1999, Indian Express, Crusade: Killing Delhi‚Äôs Lifeline , Charu Soni, 19 Aug 2006, New Delhi.

Within Delhi it is erroneously called \\"Najafgarh drain\\" or \\"Najafgarh nullah\\"', it gets this name from the once famous and huge Najafgarh lake near the town of Najafgarh in southwest Delhi and within urbanised Delhi it is the Indian capital's most polluted water body due to direct inflow of untreated sewage from surrounding populated areas. A January 2005 report by the Central Pollution Control Board clubs this drain with 13 other highly polluted wetlands under category \\"D\\" for assessing the water quality of wetlands in wildlife habitats.Blot across the Capital: Najafgarh most polluted, Sunday, 10 July 2005, The Indian ExpressEnvironment minister raises a stink over Najafgarh jheel, 22 February 2005, The Indian ExpressNajafgarh basin Delhi‚Äôs most polluted area, 25 Dec 2009, The Indian ExpressNajafgarh drain 11th among highly polluted industrial clusters, 25 Dec 2009, The Times of IndiaNajafgarh drain causes less pollution in Yamuna now , 4 July 2006, The Indian Express Najafgarh lake, marsh or jheel Najafgarh lake, Najafgarh marsh or Najafgarh jheel (Jheel in Hindi means a lake) used to be a vast lake in the south west of Delhi in India near the town of Najafgarh from which it takes its name, it was connected to the river Yamuna by a natural shallow nullah or drain called the Najafgarh nullah. However, after the 1960s the Flood Control Department of Delhi kept widening the Najafgarh drain in the pretext of saving Delhi from floods and eventually quickly drained the once huge and ecologically rich Najafgarh lake completely. Rainwater accumulating in the Najafgarh lake or jheel basin had been recorded to have occupied more than 300 square kilometres in many years before its unfortunate draining. However, with recent advances in ecological understanding it has become clear that draining of this vast lake affected the entire climate of this important region that is India's capital territory and its neighbourhood. The draining of the lake completely also caused the watertable in the entire area to go down and the area becoming arid. There have been some plans since to at least resurrect a much smaller lake in the area. Most of the Najafgarh jheel basin lands have increased many folds in their value owing to them coming within Delhi, India's capital territory and are under ownership of farmers who may want to make a fast buck selling them to developers who want to convert the former lake basin into housing complexes as has already been happening with major housing colonies coming up in the region. If Najafgarh drain, which was built to drain the original Najafgarh lake or jheel, ever breaches its wide embankments it will flood these developed lands owing to them spread all over the former low lying jheel or lake basin. Pre-draining history: A Vast lake Before the unfortunate complete draining of this lake in the 1960s by widening of the Najafgarh drain by the Flood control and irrigation department of Delhi the lake in many years filled up a depression more than 300 square kilometres in rural delhi, It had an extremely rich wetland ecosystem forming a refuge for vast quantities of waterbirds and local wildlife. The lake was one of the last habitats of the famed and endangered Siberian Crane which has all but vanished from the Indian subcontinent now. Till before independence many British colonial Officers and dignitaries came in large parties for waterfowl hunting every season.Najafgarh marsh: \\"The (Najafgarh) marsh was a favored duck-shoot ground of the British, but was eventually drained out into the Najafgarh Nallah.\\" Strategy Framework for Delhi beyond the Commonwealth Games 2010 , by Danny Cherian, 2004[A Guide to the Birds of the Delhi Area (1975) by Usha Ganguli, a member of the Delhi Birdwatching Society.][Birdwatching Articles from 1961 -70 from Najafgarh lake by Usha Ganguli in \\"Newsletter for Birdwatchers\\" edited by Zafar Futehally] Recharging of ground water table and irrigation The continuous widening of the Najafgarh drain since the 1960s led to the complete draining of the once vast and rich Najafgarh lake, jheel or marsh which directly affected the ground water table in the entire surrounding region as all the rain water after yearly monsoons that used to collect in the vast lake basin in previous years now ran off swiftly through the widened drain into river Yamuna in which it outfalls, this has been affecting the entire climate of the region as well making the region more arid and creating water shortages for the purpose of irrigation or human consumption for the people of Delhi and surrounding regions. Currently the drain is so wide and deep that it acts as an elongated lake in its own right and can hold and store a lot of rain water which can be regulated through regulators built into it at intervals.

Wildlife and waterbirds can be easily viewed from vehicles by driving on this road and stopping intermittently and going down to the waters edge. As the width of the drain is limited the flocks of waterfowl and other waterbirds in the drain can be easily observed from the drain's edges and this same fact makes the birds much more vulnerable to hunting as they remain in easy reach of the poacher's shotguns and the nets and traps set for them by local villagers and professional trappers. Clogging of water surface with floating overgrowth of water hyacinth The water hyacinth, an introduced invasive species of fast growing floating plants completely clogs the open water surface of the drain in many areas annually and lot of funds and labour is employed by the flood control department to clear it some what to keep the water flow uninterrupted. The removing of the water hyacinth by labourers also open ups the water surface for birds and migratory waterfowl which take refuge here every winter. Fishing The relatively cleaner portion of the drain in rural southwest Delhi before it enters densely populated and badly polluted area at Vikaspuri also attracts some small scale local village fishermen, occasionally one can be seen casting his line or net in the waters or floating on a black inflated truck tire tube spreading his fishing net across the breadth of the drain. A fishing license is needed to catch fish legally in Delhi waters. Farmlands in the Najafgarh lake basin area an important habitat Farmland with very little disturbance acts as an important bird habitat in the Najafgarh lake basin, even fields lying fallow are used by hundreds of congregating demoiselle cranes and common cranes, pairs of Sarus cranes can be seen in the adjoining farmland along the Najafgarh drain. Other resident wild bird and animals also inhabit these farmlands including hares, nilgai, wildcat, common fox, jackal, monitor lizards, various varieties of snakes etc. which also come for shelter into the forested embankments of the drain and disperse into the neighbouring farmland for foraging. Development of major housing colonies in the former Najafgarh lake basin After the complete draining of the lake in the 1960s the former lake basin was converted into farmland first and by now various large scale housing projects occupy the former lake basin including Vikaspuri, Uttam Nagar, Pappankalan, and Dwarka. The Delhi airport also borders the former lake basin. Land costs have skyrocketed and builders and developers have converged on this area which falls within Delhi. Land use is changing from farming to housing colony urban development. However, if the Najafgarh Drain ever breaches its man-made and fortified embankments during the monsoon season, large swaths of these housing colonies could be flooded. Bird strikes: Delhi Airport's civil aviation concerns Many flocks of migratory waterbirds during winter months have been using the Najafgarh drain and before that the once famous but now completely drained Najafgarh lake and also the other village and temporary ponds in the area after the rainy season as a winter refuge since times immemorial. In recent decades Delhi Airport (Indira Gandhi International Airport including the Delhi domestic airport) was built and expanded on the border of these lands and wildlife habitat. There have been concerns that one of the reasons for increasing Bird strikes on the landing and taking off commercial jets at the Delhi domestic as well as the international Airport could be the birds being attracted by Najafgarh Drain, sources interviewed by Times News Network in 2009 said: \\"The airport is facing so many problems only because they have taken up a huge area for development and displaced the animals and birds from there. The nearby Najafgarh drain could also be a factor why birds come into this area\\"., Most bird hits at Delhi airport, 20 Feb 2009, TNN, The Economic Times, New Delhi, India. Retrieved on 4 May 2011In IGI backyard, a new ‚Äòbird sanctuary‚Äô, 22 Mar 2010, The Indian Express Due to this reason there may also be some resistance to grant it the final approval with a Bird Sanctuary status. In similar cases it has been suggested that carcasses and feathers of birds striking aircraft should be routinely collected and listed and made available to wildlife officials to ascertain which species are mainly responsible for bird strikes and if they are waterbirds at all to help find solution to this problem. Trained meat-eating hunting raptor birds of prey such as falcons, hawks and eagles are routinely kept on airport premises and flown throughout the day by keepers to scare bird flocks away from airports, bird activity in the nights could be controlled through other well researched methods employed by other airports. However the waterbirds wintering on the Najafgarh drain may not be the ones responsible for air strikes at all as in 2008, the airfield environment management committee found that several illegal slaughterhouses near the airport area were attracting birds that were leading to problems for the aircraft. It was decided that these slaughterhouses should be shut down with immediate effect and the civic agencies responsible would take appropriate action. Officials highlighted six critical areas of Dwarka, Indira Market in RK Puram, Sadar Bazar, Mehram Nagar, Dabri More and Gazipur, where the illegal slaughterhouses were operating. Delhi International Airport (P) Ltd (DIAL) also adopted several other measures to deal with this problem. It used noise emitting guns to scare away birds and employed around 120 bird chasers, it also pigeon proofed all buildings and hangars to prevent the birds from nesting on the premises. Regular garbage removal and rodent control measures were put into place to discourage the birds., Most bird hits at Delhi airport, 20 Feb 2009, TNN, The Economic Times, New Delhi, India.

Although initially a part of the Great Seljuk Empire, it lasted longer than the Great Seljuks, reaching its apogee during the reign of Alaattin Keykubat I. But in the mid-13th century, Seljuks faced the problem of refugees. The Mongols had defeated the Khwarazm Empire at the east, and Oghuz Turk clans were escaping from the Turkistan area to Anatolia. These clans were nomadic and mostly Tengriist, i.e. non Muslim.Thesis about Babai p.15 The Seljuk sultan Gƒ±yaseddin Keyh√ºsrev II attempted to settle these people in Southeast Anatolia (Asiatic part of modern Turkey), but they defied his diktat. They started to convert to Islam, but their interpretation of Islam was more tolerant than that of the settled population, and they were regarded as heretics. However they were supported by the nomadic Turkmens of Central Anatolia who had migrated earlier than the newcomers but had the same problems.  The revolt  Gƒ±yasettin had ceded power to his ministers, notably Sadettin K√∂pek who was suspicious of a rebellion from Afshar immigrants who had settled in Anatolia, migrating from Persia after the Mongol invasion. He accordingly imprisoned the suspects which led to their movement towards Aleppo (Syria) in Ismaili dominated areas.Hamad Subani (2013) \\"The Secret History of Iran\\". Printed by Lulu. , Pg 164 He had the leaders of KhwƒÅrazm people (like Kirkhan) imprisoned. The revolt began in 1239 around Samsat (in modern Adƒ±yaman Province), and spread quickly to Central Anatolia. Baba Ishak who led the revolt was a follower of Baba ƒ∞lyas, the kadƒ± (judge) of Kayseri. He declared himself √Çmƒ´r‚Äô≈´l-Mu‚Äôminƒ´n Sadr‚Äô√ªd- D≈´nya wa‚Äôd-Dƒ´n and RƒÅss‚Äô≈´l-AllƒÅh.Encyclopedia of the Diyanet isleri baskanligi Foundation, vol 4, pages 368-369. Although the Seljuk governor of Malatya tried to suppress the revolt he was defeated by the revolutionaries around Elbistan (in modern Kahramanmara≈ü Province). The revolutionaries captured the important cities of Sivas, Kayseri and Tokat in Central and North Anatolia. The governor of Amasya killed Baba Ishak in 1240, but this did not mean the end of the revolt. The revolutionaries marched on Konya, the capital. The sultan saw that his army could not suppress the revolt, and he hired mercenaries of French origin. The revolutionaries were defeated in a decisive battle on the Malya plains near Kƒ±r≈üehir.Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 p 125 =BƒÅbƒÅ EliyƒÅs al- KhorƒÅsƒÅnƒ´= BƒÅbƒÅ EliyƒÅs al-KhorƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ (‚Ä† 1240)Mehmed Fuad K√∂pr√ºl√º, citing Ibn Bibi in his book \\"Anadolu'da ƒ∞slamiyet\\" (Islam in Anatolia) (1922), identifies BƒÅbƒÅ with Baba Ishak who led The BƒÅbƒÅ IshƒÅq Rebellion; this is contradicted by other scholars, such as David Cook in his book Martyrdom in Islam (2007; p. 84), citing historical references, such as the ManƒÅkib ul-Qudsiyya (14th century) was an influential mystic from Eastern Persia, who was the murshid of Aybak BƒÅbƒÅ who in turn was the murshid of one of the leading actors of the Babais Rebellion, namely BƒÅbƒÅ IshƒÅq Kafarsudƒ´ as well.

Aftermath  The revolt was suppressed with much bloodshed. But with the diversion of resources needed to suppress the revolt, the Seljuk army was severely affected. The defence of the eastern provinces was largely ignored, and most of Anatolia was plundered. The Seljuks lost the valuable trade colony in the Crimea, on the north of the Black Sea. The Mongol commander Bayju saw this as an opportunity to occupy East Anatolia, and in 1242 he captured Erzurum. In 1243, he defeated Keyh√ºsrev's army in the battle of K√∂sedaƒü, and the Seljuks became vassals of the Mongols.

He is the eldest of six brothers and sisters. Michel married Marleine Sayde in 1986 and together they have four children, George, Mark, Edwina and Perla.  Daher Foods  Michel Daher founded Daher Foods in 1992, one of the largest FMCG companies in the MENA region. Daher Foods operates one of the largest salty snacks operations in the Middle East. In 2016, Daher Foods started producing packaged nuts and kernels in a brand new production facility. In 2019, Daher Foods added biscuits and wafers to its portfolio of products in a brand new production facility.

Daher Capital invests in developed public market equities, emerging markets equities, private equity and venture capital. Some of Daher Capital's publicly known investments include FXCM, where in 2007, Daher Capital joined forces with Lehman Brothers and Yale University to purchase a 35% stake. FXCM went public on the NYSE in December 2010 with a market capitalization of $1.6 billion, a process in which Daher had an active role in. In 2013, Daher sold his FXCM stake and invested in rival Gain Capital. In 2013, Daher purchased a large stake in the largest poultry producer in the US, Pilgrim's Pride and became the company's second largest shareholder. In 2013, Pilgrim's Pride had revenues of $9.0 billion. Daher Capital is also known to be a very active Venture Capital investor. In 2017, Daher Capital was recognized as \\"one of the biggest supporters of Los Angeles tech companies behind the scenes\\" by the LA Times.

In April 2019, Daher Capital worked with BridgePoint Advisers to acquire Kyriba in a deal valuing the company at $1.2 billion. Other companies that Daher invested in that went public include TrueCar and Stonegate Mortgage.  Political career  Michel Daher expressed concerns on Lebanon's economic model as early as 2012 saying \\"unless the government embarks on painful austerity measures, Lebanon‚Äôs economy will inch closer to the edge of a disaster\\" in a DailyStar interview at the time. In 2018, Michel Daher ran for parliament on an economic reform agenda looking to decrease Lebanon's reliance on diaspora remittances and increase the country's productivity, believing the current model was not sustainable. In May 2018, Michel Daher was elected as an independent to Lebanon's parliament in the Zahle district, one of Lebanon's most contested and competitive areas in parliamentary elections. Daher ran against political dynasties and won by a wide margin. Upon his election, Daher vowed to transfer all salaries and benefits from the state that come during his tenure to the Lebanese Army. Daher's political positions have revolved around Lebanon's economy, warning against an impending economic collapse if the political establishment did not effect reforms. Lebanon's economy collapsed in October 2019 due to its heavy debt, corruption, reliance on remittances and the banking sector, and lack of productivity. To mitigate the full effects of the economic collapse, in November 2019 Daher submitted a Capital Control law to parliament as well as the abolishing of Banking Secrecy laws in order to return stolen public funds, both of which were rejected by the existing political establishment. Daher also serves as a board member of the Association of Lebanese Industrialists (ALI) and is on the Executive Committee of Higher Council for Greek Catholics in Lebanon.

The golden age that the pogroms couldn‚Äôt destroy, Jewish Chronicle, February 5, 2009. \\"The resulting hysteria led to pogroms such as the one that took place in Erfurt, the capital of the German state of Thuringia, where 1,000 Jews were killed in a single day of violence on March 2, 1349.\\" Although these beliefs, and the accompanying massacres, were frequently encouraged by local bishops or itinerant Flagellants, the Catholic Church, including Pope Clement VI under whom the Flagellants and the Black Death began, and his successor, Innocent VI, were firmly against it. In a papal bull condemning the Flagellant movement in late 1349, Pope Clement VI criticized their \\"shedding the blood of Jews\\". Erfurt later suffered the ravages of the Black Plague, where over 16,000 residents died during a ten- week period in 1350. Massacres were generally accompanied by extensive looting. One of the items looted in the Erfurt massacre was what is now the oldest remaining manuscript of the Tosefta, which dates from the 12th century. The Erfurt Manuscripts, including the Tosefta, came into the possession of Erfurt City Council after the Massacre, and in the late 17th century ended up in the library of the Lutheran Evangelical Ministry, at Erfurt's former Augustinian Monastery. The Ministry sold them to the Royal Library in Berlin, the present day Berlin State Library, in 1880, where they are now kept.Erfurt Collection: Erfurt Hebrew Manuscripts (Accessed: 8 June 2017) According to one reference, there are bloodstains on the Tosefta manuscript. Many of the Jews of Erfurt preemptively hid their valuables. Some of those valuables, probably belonging to merchant Kalman of Wiehe, were found in 1998, and are now referred to as the Erfurt Treasure.

The origins of Drift Trikes come from California in the U.S.A. where enthusiast Marty Spellman built the original Drift Trike and a group of friends had him build theirs so they could race them on the hills of Laguna Beach, Malibu, Fullerton and more. As can be seen in the LA Times Newspaper clipping and 8mm video, these trikes and riders are similar to the enthusiasts of today. Marty is recognized by the following organizations and countries as the originator of the Drift Trike: Brazil (Kamikaze Trikers & Guiguinotrike), Italy (Drift One), Australia, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Spain, Columbia, France (Federation France de Drift Trike), and U.S.Ahttps://www.dieepic.com/blogs/news/the-first-drift- trikehttps://www.melbournedrifttrikes.com/the-real-drift-trike- creator/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RLmbkfMxc8 Drift triking has a dedicated following and is quickly growing in popularity across the globe. The resurgence of drift trikes come from New Zealand, fueled by its on-going car and drift culture of 'boy racers' and car enthusiasts. Drift triking quickly began to spread to other countries soon after, including Australia, the United States, Colombia, many European nations and various other countries. In 2011, a non-profit organization called the American Drift Trike Association was founded in the United States, with the goal of promoting the sport of drift triking but has since disbanded. Usage Smooth roads are preferred to coarse chip-sealed roads, as coarse surfaces tend to wear rear wheels faster, create a rougher ride and even reduce drifting ability. Riders gather most of their momentum through gravity but many trike drifters choose to employ a freewheeling, pedaled front wheel, which makes for a more versatile trike. The freewheel hub allows the rider to pedal and obtain forward momentum but allows for coasting when not pedaling. Another means to gain initial momentum is to stand on the rear of the trike and to kick or push backwards with one leg. Operating speeds for drift trikes generally range between 25-50 mph. Drift triking has become a recognized sport, with crews such as Drift Trikes Whangarei being sponsored by Red Bull.  Design and manufacturers  The slick rear wheels are commonly made from a hard plastic such as PVC. Proper drift trike wheels can also be created by sliding PVC or polyethylene pipe over deflated pneumatic wheels and then re-inflating them to lock them in place. Many drift trikes are home made or custom-fabricated by professional welders. However, certain bike manufacturers such as Drift Trike Factory, Huffy, Trek, Aldi's brand Crane, Airwalk, Triciclos de la Monta√±a and a number of other companies have commercially released children's versions, and Local Motors was the first to introduce an electric adult's version. Drift Trike Factory located in Brisbane Australia in 2015 is one of the worlds original motorized drift trike manufacturers and parts suppliers. Drift Trike Factory supplies all of the parts needed to build a motorized drift trike, as well as supplying highly detailed drift trike frame plans for making a motorized drift trike. This original trike manufacturer continue to provide good service and quality reliable information as well BlackTop Engineering released the first adult's fuel-driven drift trike with a suspension system and \\"G-Force Bars\\". One of the biggest names in drift triking is Triad Drift Trikes from Australia, who have been manufacturing custom drift trikes for over 3 years. Instead of choosing to buy brand-name drift trikes from manufacturers, many enthusiasts have chosen to design and build their own. Generally, this involves using an old kids' bike or BMX and modifying the frame to fit an axle and seat on the back. This allows people to give their trikes their own unique look, while being cost-effective. = Kiting drift trikes = Rather than gravity drift triking, some drift trikes use wind power from kites to move. = Motorized drift trikes = Fuel driven drift trikes are gas-powered. With all the torque being applied to the rear wheels, it becomes much easier to drift at low speeds.  Laws and regulations  Drift triking commonly falls within the jurisdiction of cyclist traffic laws. Many districts, regions, and countries require the use of helmets, brakes, a rear red reflector, and front lights. Some regions categorize them as \\"gravity\\" vehicles, where they are treated similarly to skateboards and street luges.

Early life and education Bunin's father, Samuil Markovich, was a bolshevik, a member of the Communist Party from before the 1917 revolution and worked as a professor of social economics at one of the Moscow Institutes. Bunin was named \\"Revol\\" after the October revolution. Volik (as he was known) was six when he started to write music and he started by writing scores. In the 1930s in Soviet Union score paper was hard to find, so young Bunin would draw lines on plain paper for his compositions. He wrote marches, waltzes, minuets, and polkas. Bunin‚Äôs mother was always very ill, and died when he was 14, leaving his upbringing entirely in the hands of his father. When Bunin‚Äôs mother was dying, she asked him to play the piano for her. He played Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and Mussorgsky through the night. Next morning he had his first attack of asthma, a disease that would in the end kill him. In 1938 Revol started his composition studies at the Music School of the Moscow Conservatory under Professor Ilya Litinsky. During his third year of studies he was admitted to the Conservatory and continued under Professor Vissarion Shebalin, who was, at the time, the Conservatory‚Äôs director. In 1941, he was summoned first to work at the military factory in Moscow and then was drafted to an active duty. So that he could continue to attend his classes, given his musical gift, he was stationed near Moscow. He was decommissioned on the grounds of ill health in March 1943. In June 1943 Shostakovich started to teach at the Moscow Conservatory and Bunin was the first student he selected to be his pupil. In his article \\"With great appreciation\\", published posthumously in the magazine Soviet Music in September 1976, Bunin wrote \\"... We were more and more conquered by Shostakovich‚Äôs works. Secretly, I was dreaming of becoming his student. Finally, this happy day came on 7 June 1943, in classroom number 31... At the piano a friendly man, dressed in a gray-colored modest suit, wearing horn- rimmed spectacles. He looked very young, nothing like the old eminent scholars of the Conservatory. He asked me in detail how old I was, when I had started to compose, who were my teachers, whether I had studied polyphony and so on; he subjected me to a small exam ‚Äì I had to read a Haydn symphony score, tell him what was the difference between a passacaglia and a chaconne, give examples, known to me, of a mirror reprise in symphonic allegro, and give examples for the use of French horns and trumpets in a rare formation (H, Fis). Shostakovich was interested to know if I read a lot and if I liked Chekhov and Leskov...‚Äù For a while, Bunin was Shostakovich‚Äôs only student. He graduated from the Conservatory in 1945 with honors. Shebalin could not forgive Bunin‚Äôs defection to Shostakovich's class from his own and did not allow his name to be added to the ‚ÄúGolden Board‚Äù of exemplary students. Composer In 1947, Bunin moved to Leningrad, where he taught music arrangement at the Leningrad Conservatory and assisted Shostakovich as a co- professor of composition. In the same year, his 2nd Symphony was premiered in Leningrad, under the direction of Yevgeny Mravinsky. In 1948, he moved back to Moscow and worked as an editor for the State Music Publishing House. After a government decree set stringent regulations on music and art in the Soviet Union, Shostakovich was dismissed from his post of Professor at the Conservatory. Consequently, his assistant, Bunin, also lost his position and became, for a while, a persona non grata. He had to make his living by writing scores for other composers. His music won the Stalin Prize on several occasions, but Bunin‚Äôs name did not appear, nor was it mentioned to the selection committee. Death and legacy Revol Bunin died on 3 July 1976 in Moscow. He was mourned by his wife, Larisa, his friends and many students. He had no children. He was never awarded State honors, for he refused to join the Communist Party, in contrast to many of his colleagues. Bunin wrote music scores for 48 motion pictures, cartoons, and documentaries. He left 45 major compositions, including nine symphonies, numerous sonatas, quartets, trios, an opera, romances, and several concertos for both piano and violin. His viola concerto (Op. 22) was composed in 1953 and dedicated to his close friend, violist Rudolf Barshay, who would later found and direct the Moscow Chamber Orchestra.

Kornfeld is an American psychiatrist best known for his work on psychiatric issues associated with medical practice. This subspecialty is known as Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry or Psychosomatic Medicine. Education and career Kornfeld received a BS from Franklin and Marshall College in 1946, and an MD from Yale School of Medicine in 1954. He received his psychiatric training at the New York State Psychiatric Institute/Presbyterian Hospital. He received a certificate from the Columbia University Institute for Psychoanalysis in 1966. He served as Director of the Psychiatric Consultation/Liaison Service at the Presbyterian Hospital from 1964‚Äì2000, and in 1986, in association with Richard Sloan, established the Behavioral Medicine Service. He was appointed Associate Dean of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1985, and served as Director of Continuing Medical Education from 1988-2009. He was Chairman of the Institutional Review Board at the New York State Psychiatric Institute from 1979 to 1985 and the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center from 1988 to 2001. He is currently Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry. Research Kornfeld‚Äôs research has concentrated on the interface between medicine and psychiatry, and often appears in medical and surgical journals. His description of post- cardiotomy delirium and his subsequent work on the psychiatric impact of the intensive care environment led to the concept of ICU Psychosis. This work created a greater awareness of the psychological impact of the ICU environment on patients and staff, focused attention on human needs, and influenced the architectural design of these units. In 1971, Kornfeld, Richard Friedman, and JT Bigger demonstrated the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation on medical house officers. This led to a nationwide change in the scheduling of on-call duty from every other night to every third night. A paper by Kornfeld and Harry D. Albert on patients‚Äô threats to sign out of a general hospital against advice was the first publication to point out the complex array of motivations and circumstances which contribute to such problems. Kornfeld and Stephan Levitan demonstrated that the presence of a psychiatrist on an orthopedic unit reduced length of hospital stay and increased the likelihood of patients returning to home. This paper was widely used to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of the liaison psychiatrist in the general hospital. At a time when clinicians were being compelled to always be ‚Äútruthful‚Äù with their patients, he pointed out the complexity of that principle in, ‚ÄúWhat Truth for Which Patient at What Time?‚Äù Kornfeld initiated one of the first studies to utilize the denervated human heart, created at the time of cardiac transplantation, as the basis for the study of the psychophysiology of cardiac rhythm. To accompany the establishment of Consultation Liaison Psychiatry as an established subspecialty, Kornfeld reviewed its contributions to the practice of Medicine. Most recently he has explored the problem of research misconduct in an effort to develop remedies from the perspective of a psychiatrist. Kornfeld and Gerry Finkel co-edited the book, Psychiatric Management for Medical Practitioners (1982, Grune and Stratton). Kornfeld also contributed chapters to textbooks in general psychiatry, consultation liaison psychiatry, medicine, and surgery. He served on the editorial boards of the journals, General Hospital Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, and on the editorial boards of the Lippincott Textbook of Psychiatry; Medical Psychiatric Practice, Textbook of Consultation Liaison Psychiatry ([APA] Press); and the Columbia University Electronic Textbook, Cardinal Topics in Medicine. He was elected President of the American Psychosomatic Society; received the Hackett Award for his contributions to Consultation/Liaison Psychiatry from the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine, and a Special Citation from the Society of Liaison Psychiatry. He served as Chairman of the Consultation/Liaison Committee of the American Psychiatric Association. References Faculty Profile for Donald S.

Biography  Viktor Fainberg was born to the married couple of Isaac Fainberg and Sarah Dashevskaya. In his life as a child, while attending school during an antisemitic campaign of 1948-1952, he was subjected to harassment that, in his own words, he did not reconcile himself to, but entered the fray with an abuser. As the result of these frays, he got a referral to a psychiatrist. In 1957, in connection with antisemitic insult, he had a fight with a policeman and for this reason was sentenced to 1 year of corrective labor. In 1968, he graduated from the English unit of the philological department of the Leningrad University where he defended his diploma thesis about writer Salinger with distinction. In the summer of 1968, Fainberg worked as a guide for the Pavlovsk Palace. Viktor Fainberg was one of the seven persons who participated in the 1968 Red Square demonstration against the intervention into Czechoslovakia. During the demonstration and his arrest, he lost many teeth and in this unpresentable state was never presented for trial; instead, he was placed to a psychiatric hospital. Fainberg was examined by the Serbsky Institute commission composed of G.V. Morozov, D.R. Lunts and Y.L. Lindau. In their act No 35 / s dated October 10, 1968, they did not mention the invasion of Czechoslovakia, which gave rise to this demonstration, the action was merely described as 'disorderly conduct at Red Square,' and Fainberg's mental condition was described as follows: (The Russian text of the book in full is available online on the website of the organization \\"Help for Psychiatric Survivors\\") As a result, he was committed for compulsory treatment to the Special Psychiatric Hospital in Leningrad where he was confined from January 1969 to February 1973. At the hospital, Fainberg went on hunger strike in protest, was subjected to forced feeding and was treated with chlorpromazine despite his hyperthyroidism that was somatic contraindication to chlorpromazine therapy. Marina Vaykhanskaya, a psychiatrist at the hospital, assisted Fainberg by passing information about him to dissidents outside. She was dismissed for this activity which helped Fainberg be released. In 1974, they married and emigrated from the Soviet Union. In emigration, Fainberg has initiated the formation of \\"Campaign Against Psychiatric Abuses\\" (CAPA) to fight punitive psychiatry in the USSR. In 1983, the Soviet Union was expelled from the World Psychiatric Association (WPA).  Other  On October 27, 2014, along with other 3 dissenters from summer of 1968, Viktor Fainberg was decorated by Slovak President Andrej Kiska for his show of solidarity to Czechoslovakia. He received the Medal of the President of the Slovak republic along with Vladimir Dremlyuga and Pavel Litvinov. Natalya Gorbanevskaya received the highest Slovak award, Order of the White Double Cross, in memoriam. Renowned British playwright Tom Stoppard wrote the play Every Good Boy Deserves Favour dedicated to Vladimir Bukovsky and Viktor Fainberg. Viktor has daughter, Sarah, who is a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.

In the film, a woman is haunted by her conscience after she kills a man and hides the body. It is based on the novel You're Best Alone by Norah Lofts. Plot Jamie (Reynolds) is the getaway driver for a gang of robbers, but when the robbery goes wrong he drives off and makes his way by car and then train to a rural village, Welford, in Devon, where his estranged uncle, Kit (Holt), lives alone. Although Kit is not particularly pleased to see Jamie, he allows him to stay for a couple of days. A couple of days' stopover turns into an indefinite period, as Jamie, all the while sneering at Kit's rural life, gets a job (or is it a partnership?) at the local garage and eats Kit out of house and home. Things get momentarily worse for Kit as Jamie's estranged wife Linda (Sellars) turns up, hoping for reconciliation, but although Kit is wary of another unwanted guest at first, Linda is far more amenable than Jamie, whose attention has been diverted away by Betty (Morris), a single woman in the village whom he starts an affair with. Jamie is found to be stealing from Kit as well as the garage and when Linda confronts him he assaults her, and she kills him accidentally in an act of self-defence. Kit and Linda decide to hide the body, which draws them even closer together, and after telling the few people that are interested that Jamie has left the farm, life continues as before with Kit and Linda having fallen in love. Linda is still haunted by memories of Jamie however, and the situation becomes worse when Jamie's mother Eva (Avice Landone) arrives unexpectedly to see Jamie. Linda suffers something akin to a nervous breakdown, and the local doctor called to assist becomes suspicious at Linda's condition and actions, and calls the police. The police arrive and search for Jamie's body but are unable to find it, and are about to leave, when Linda's conscience gets the better of her and she calls them back to the house, presumably to make a complete confession and face the consequences, with Kit by her side. This departs from the plot of the original Norah Lofts novel, with its far more appropriate title, You're Best Alone, in which it is Kit who accidentally kills Jamie, and is in love with pathetic Linda. Her subsequent pregnancy is certainly Jamie's though she tells na√Øve Kit it is his. Her extravagant and extreme fear of childbirth leads her to a kind of emotional breakdown in which she tells police that Kit murdered her husband Jamie. The body is not found, but Kit commits suicide, alone with his beloved dog who he shoots first, reasoning she is too old to take to a new master. His note absolves Linda completely though she was certainly complicit. He does this for love of her, and for Jamie whom he disliked and disapproved of, but who was his much-loved sister's son and who was nothing as glamorous as a getaway driver, but rather a middle class, though seedy, con man. The book is a genuine tragedy. Locations An early shot is of the Torbay Express at Paddington and the scene then shifts to a shot of a down express at Coryton's Cove, Dawlish. There follow many scenes shot at Ashburton with Tillingham's garage being located next door to the site of the former Golden Lion hotel. Linda arrives by train at Staverton station where steam engines still run on the preserved South Devon Railway but the shot of her leaving the station jumps back to Ashburton. Recognisable coastal scenes are in Torquay where Thatcher's Rock, Hope's Nose and Long Quarry Point under Wall's Hill all appear in shot. The outdoor shots of the farmhouse were at Whitedell Farm, Sarratt, Hertfordshire The internal scenes are not very convincing representations of rural Devon architecture.

Reported messages can be email messages, blog comments, or any kind of spam. Flagging user generated content in web sites Abuse reports are a particular kind of feedback whereby users can flag other users' posts as abusive content. Most web sites that allow user generated content either apply some sort of moderation based on abuse reports, such as hiding or deleting the offending content at a defined threshold, or implement a variety of user roles that allow users to govern the site's contents cooperatively. Email spam reporting Spammers' behavior ranges from somehow forcing users to opt in, to cooperatively offering the possibility to opt out, to wildly hiding the sender's identity (including phishing). The most intractable cases can be dealt by reporting the abusive message to hash-sharing systems like, for example, Vipul's Razor for the benefit of other victims. In some cases, there may be a cooperative component on the sender side who will use spam reports to fix or mitigate the problem at its origin; for example, it may use them to detect botnets, educate the sender, or simply unsubscribe the report's originator. Email spam legislation varies by country, forbidding abusive behavior to some extent, and in some other cases it may be worth prosecuting spammers and claiming damages. RFC 6650 recommends that recipients of abusive messages report that to their mailbox providers. The provider's abuse-team should determine the best course of action, possibly considering hash-sharing and legal steps. If the sender had subscribed to a Feedback Loop (FBL), the mailbox provider will forward the complaint as a feedback report according to the existing FBL agreement. Otherwise, mailbox providers should determine who is responsible of the abuse and forward the complaint to them. Those recipients of unsolicited abuse reports are actually prospect FBL subscribers, inasmuch as the mailbox provider needs to offer them some means to manage the report stream. On the other hand, mailbox providers can prevent further messages from non- cooperative senders of abusive content. Abuse reports are sent by email using the Abuse Reporting Format (ARF), except for the initial notification by the recipient in cases where a mailbox implementation provides for more direct means. The target address of an abuse report depends on which authority the abusive message is going to be reported to. Choices include the following: # A public reporting hub, or global reputation tracker, such as SpamCop or Abusix's blackhole.mx. Different degrees of skill are required to properly interact with different hubs. # The domain-specific reporting hub is the recommended choice for end users. See also the wiki summary of that mail thread. If provided, it should be accessible by a visible button or menu item in the mail client. # A feedback loop subscriber can be selected as a target by a mailbox provider after receiving an end-user report. Users should be aware of their provider's policy. # The abuse POC of an authenticated domain who handled the reported message. DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is the usual authentication protocol, but Sender Policy Framework (SPF) can be used in the same way. A mailbox provider choice. # The abuse POC for the IP address of the last relay. Some skill is required to properly locate such data. This is the default choice for a mailbox provider whose server had received the abusive message (before the recipient reported it) and annotated the relevant IP address. There are various sites who maintain POC databases, such as Network Abuse Clearinghouse (by name), Abusix (by IP address (number)), and more. There is also a hierarchy of delegations at the relevant Regional Internet registry (RIR), and each corresponding Whois record may include a POC, either as a remark or as a more specific database object, e.g. an Incident response team. The first three methods provide for full email addresses to send reports to. Otherwise, target abuse mailboxes can be assumed to be in the form defined by RFC 2142 (abuse@example.com), or determined by querying either the RIR's whois databases‚Äîwhich may have query result limits‚Äî or other databases created specifically for this purpose. There is a tendency to mandate the publication of exact abuse POCs. Abused receivers can automate spam reporting to different degrees: they can push a button when they see the message, or they can run a tool that automatically quarantines and reports messages that it recognizes as spam. When no specific tools are available, receivers have to report abuse by hand; that is, they forward the spammy message as an attachment‚Äîso as to include the whole header‚Äîand send it to the chosen authority. Mailbox providers can also use tools to automatically process incidents notifications.One is Abusehelper See also * Abuse Reporting Format * Feedback loop (email)  References  Email Anti-spam ","title":"Spam reporting"},{"id":"31564573","text":"This is a listing of notable people born in, or notable for their association with, Aceh.

History The tower is part of a rectangular, moated enclosure near the village of Paull, dating from the beginning of the 15th century. The tower is three storeys high, each floor having a single chamber, the whole protected by a portcullis entrance. There has been debate as to the purpose of the site - in part the fortification resembles the more northern pele towers, although alternatively the tower may have been built to give luxury accommodation overlooking the River Humber which runs nearby, similar to some properties built near King's Lynn. It is a unique building for the period and region. The tower was restored in 1871, from which the current windows, doorways and plasterwork dates, but has been roofless since the early 20th century and as of 2010 is ruined and in what English Heritage considers to be a very bad condition. It is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building. In December 2016 a grant of ¬£160,000 was secured from Historic England to enable restoration work to begin with an aim of completing the work by September 2017.

Nissen (born 1948), is a cardiologist, researcher and patient advocate. He was chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio.Steven Nissen MD, physician profile , Cleveland Clinic, retrieved 2/2010 Joining Cleveland Clinic in 1992, Nissen served as Vice- Chairman of the Department of Cardiology (1993‚Äì2002), Section Head of Clinical Cardiology (1992‚Äì2000) and Director of the Coronary Intensive Care Unit (1992‚Äì1997). Most recently, he served as Medical Director of the Cleveland Clinic Cardiovascular Coordinating Center (C5), an organization that directs multi-center clinical trials. Nissen still attends in the Cardiac Critical Care Unit periodically throughout the year. Education Nissen graduated high school from the Webb School of California and pursued his undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan. He then went on to receive his medical degree from the University of Michigan School of Medicine in Ann Arbor. He completed his internal medicine internship and residency at the University of California, Davis in Sacramento, thereafter completed his cardiology fellowship at the University of Kentucky Medical Center in Lexington. Imaging technology He produced the first images in humans in 1990 and began using IVUS to document the ubiquitous prevalence of coronary artery disease. The technology has been the basis for his research during the last decade and Nissen is currently the principal investigator for several large IVUS atherosclerosis trials. Advocacy Nissen has led a number of inquiries as to the scientific integrity of many medications currently on the market. Starting with linked COX-2 inhibitors, such as Vioxx (rofecoxib) in 2001, Nissen was one of the first physicians to link it to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. Three years later Merck pulled Vioxx from the market when additional studies confirmed that daily, long-term use of the drug could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. A few years later, in 2005, Nissen re-analyzed the data related to the Bristol-Myers Squibb drug Pargluva (muraglitazar), an experimental type 2 diabetes drug. When an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel charged with reviewing the clinical trial data approved the drug, he immediately began an in-depth analysis. In 2007, the meta-analysis by Nissen and his co-investigator Kathy Wolksi, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association online on October 20, found that the diabetes drug rosiglitazone (Avandia) produced by GlaxoSmithKline carried high cardiovascular risks,. The FDA issued an alert on May 21, 2007, leading to a warning by the Food and Drug Administration and a sales loss of about 75% for the drug. The FDA was not made aware of the Nissen meta-analysis results until the day of its publication. In an editorial written in the Wall Street Journal, former FDA deputy commissioner Scott Gottlieb characterized the failure to inform FDA of the results in advance of publication as \\"upstage the FDA in an attempt to influence public debate.\\" BioCentury editor Steve Edelson said that congressional staffers but not the FDA had been briefed on the study results in advance. In November 2013, the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on rosiglitazone after reviewing the results of the 2009 RECORD clinical trial (a six-year, open label randomized control trial), which failed to show heart infarct risks associated with the drug.[7][8] Research In 2003 Nissen led a Journal of the American Medical Association study, producing evidence that five weekly infusions of ApoA-I Milano/phospholipids complex, a synthetic form of HDL, can possibly remove significant amounts of plaque from coronary arteries. The lipoprotein enhanced the ability of HDL, or ‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol to usher fat out of the arteries and into the liver for excretion leading to the purchase of Esperion Therapeutics, the tiny company that had produced recombinant Apo-A1 Milano, by Pfizer for $1.3 billion. Also in 2005, Nissen published the results of the REVERSAL trial, a headto-head comparison of the statins atorvastatin (Lipitor) and pravastatin (Pravachol). IVUS images showed that Lipitor had effectively halted the progression of plaque buildup, but coronary disease progressed considerably in those given Pravachol. The study suggested that treatments should aim to lower LDL, or ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol levels as much as possible. In 2006, Nissen and his co-investigators reported on The ASTEROID trial (A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Rosuvastatin On Intravascular Ultrasound-Derived Coronary Atheroma Burden). The study concluded that intensive use of statins resulting in a decreased LDL and increased HDL can reverse the build-up of plaque in coronary arteries, as measured by IVUS.

Something of a shrewd visionary he turned to aircraft in 1906. Background George Holt Thomas was the seventh son of William Luson Thomas (1830-1890) and his wife Annie, daughter of John Wilson Carmichael. Born at Hampton House, Stockwell, south London, educated privately and at King's College School, London he left Queen's College Oxford in 1890 after two years and without taking a degree.

Aviation During 1906 he turned his attention to aviation recognising its extraordinary potential. He became associated with the Farman brothers Dick, Henri and Maurice Farman born in Paris of English parents involved with newspapers. Through the Farmans he engaged a French pilot, Louis Paulhan, to compete for the ¬£10,000 prize Holt Thomas's friend Lord Northcliffe of the Daily Mail offered in 1906 for a successful flight from London to Manchester, a distance far greater than anyone had then flown.

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs.

His father is the educator Eugene Wijeysingha, who is a former principal of Temasek Junior College (1980-1985) and Raffles Institution (1986-1994). Dr Wijeysingha studied at Victoria School in Singapore, before heading to the United Kingdom where he studied at the University of Lincoln and earned a doctorate in Social Policy at the University of Sheffield.

He also publishes scholarly papers on social work and has worked as a lecturer in social work at SIM University. Political career Dr Wijeysingha has stated that he joined the SDP because he realised he had a responsibility as a Singaporean to work for change, saying that: \\"I cannot look the other way as more and more people experience the adverse effects of current PAP policies.\\" Prior to the 2011 general election, Channel NewsAsia invited the main political parties in Singapore to record an hour-long televised pre-election forum (the first forum of this nature in Singapore since the 1988 general election). The programme, in English entitled, A political forum on Singapore's future, brought together the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) and four opposition parties to discuss long and short-term challenges for the country. Dr Wijeysingha represented the SDP in the discussion. Just days before Nomination Day on 27 April 2011, the PAP team in the Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency (GRC) led by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, told the press that the SDP was \\"suppressing\\" a video which would \\"raise some awkward questions\\" about the party's agenda.

History The school was founded in 1980 and was named after Monsignor James Sheahan, a Catholic priest who served in Orange for nearly 50 years. The school was formed by the merger of Santa Maria College, a girls' school, and De La Salle College, a boys' school..  Design  The first stage of James Sheahan Catholic High School was completed in late 1977, when secondary school boys from the local De La Salle College began to attend. In 1980 the school became co-educational when girls from Santa Maria School began attending. The original design only consisted of a 2-3 floored C-shaped building housing classrooms facing North with a wing leading off the edge of the East housing the office and a four-room building adjacent to the corner of the West edge which housed the first science labs. There was also a large house which was where the De La Salle Brothers lived for several years. There were also four basketball courts, four netball courts and two cricket nets down from the school on a large asphalt expanse known as \\"the tarmac\\". Several years later another two-floored C-shaped extension was added containing more classrooms and several art rooms closing off the original C-shape creating the Quad later on one side of the quad was turned into a large staff room. There was a single storey industrial technology wing on the edge of the second C. Several demountables were located on the exterior side of the second C. In 1987, a Chapel was built in the school grounds which still stands today. There are also six tennis courts, situated between the netball courts and the now-relocated demountables. In 1994, a two-storey wing was added to the north-west side of the main building, extending beyond the Chapel and creating the western boundary of what is now known as the \\"Senior Area\\" (bounded on the south by the art block, on the east by the bus bay, on the north by the admin building, with the Chapel in the middle). The demountables were also removed and now serve as storage sheds adjacent to the tennis courts. A large, separate two-storey building was constructed on the West side of the Quad to house the new library and food technology rooms. To the south of that building, the original four-lab science block stands, including the renovated staffroom. Slightly further south, the newer, two lab science block stands, bounded by the staff carpark (E), the old labs (N), the tarmac (W) and adjacent houses (S). Behind the library and food technology rooms is a large Industrial Technology building, which houses woodwork, metal work, mechanics, sewing, graphic technology and computing rooms. There is also a staff room. In 2001, a large multipurpose hall was built. The hall provides two indoor basketball courts, a P.E. staffroom, P.E. storerooms, a large gym mezzanine a drama/dance room, music room and changing rooms with toilet amenities. This coincided with the construction of an oval with 2 football fields and a cricket pitch, which is named Norton Park. The school hall was officially named Mercy Hall in 2011. In early 2016, the construction of a large facility began with an outdoor amphitheatre, music rooms and a large multipurpose room. The original date of completion was 30 September, 2016. The project was completed in May 2017, with the official opening taking place that same month with distinguished guests.

Geography  The Kirnitzsch, also called the Kirnscht or Kirnsch in the local dialect, rises in the Lusatian Highlands in Bohemia west of the village of Stud√°nka (German Sch√∂nborn) and flows westwards through the town of Kr√°sn√° L√≠pa (Sch√∂nlinde). Behind the village of (Khaa, part of Kr√°sn√° L√≠pa) it wends its way along narrow ravines through the sandstone rocks of Bohemian Switzerland. The wild, romantic valley is also called the Khaatal (Kyjovske √∫doli) (Khaa valley). On the site of the former village of Hinterdaubitz ('), demolished after 1945, the border stream of Wei√übach empties into the Kirnitzsch, which, from this point, forms the border between the Czech Republic and Saxony. Further downstream the Kirnitzsch is first impounded at the Obere Schleuse (\\"Upper Lock\\") so that boating can take place on the stream. At the end of the Kirnitzsch Gorge (Kirnitzschklamm) used to stand the houses of the border village of (Hinterdittersbach) and the settlement of K≈ôinice (Kirnscht). These places, too, no longer exist. From here the Kirnitzsch flows through Saxon Switzerland, where it is impounded again at the Niedere Schleuse (\\"Lower Lock\\"). Shortly thereafter the Kirnitzsch enters the narrow Kirnitzsch Valley (Kirnitzschtal). It flows through the valley for about to the Lichtenhain Waterfall. After another it discharges into the Elbe at Bad Schandau. Over its last few kilometres it is followed by the Kirnitzschtal tramway that runs parallel to the Kirnitzsch.

Born in 1809 at Neumarkt in Silesia, von Kirchbach entered the cadet school in 1824. In 1826 he was named an ensign in the Regiment F√ºrst Leopold von Anhalt- Dessau. In 1827 he became a sub-lieutenant. From 1831 to 1834 he studied at the Prussian Military Academy, which was a prerequisite to joining the General Staff. In 1838 he joined the Prussian General Staff's topography division. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1840, captain in 1845 and major in 1850. From 1855 to 1858 he was a divisional chief on the General Staff. In 1859 von Kirchbach became commander of the 36th Infantry Regiment. Before being promoted to major general in 1863, von Kirchbach served as the chief of staff of the 3rd Army corps in Berlin. During the Second Schleswig War von Kirchbach was given command of the 21st Infantry brigade. At the start of the Austro- Prussian War in 1866 von Kirchbach was promoted to lieutenant general and named the commander of the 10th Infantry division. He distinguished himself in the battle of Nachod, and in engagements at Skalitz and Schweinsch√§del. For these actions he was awarded the Pour le M√©rite. His division was not engaged at K√∂niggr√§tz When the Franco-Prussian War erupted in 1870 von Kirchbach was promoted to General der Infanterie and appointed to command the Prussian V Corps.

Sahira is employed at Holby City Hospital as a Cardiothoracic surgical registrar. She is an old acquaintance of Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) who is the CEO and Director of Surgery at the hospital. She has been portrayed as an honest character with a \\"warm heart\\". She approaches her career with perfectionist tendencies which is compromised by her emotional vulnerability. Her main relationships were with Henrik, friendship with registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam) and a feud with consultant cardiothoracic surgeon Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel). Rouass later decided to leave the show. Storylines Sahira arrives at Holby City Hospital as a registrar on the cardiothoracic surgery ward, Darwin. Having taken time out from her career to have two children, she is assigned a mentor ‚Äì a reluctant Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel), who sees her as a potential rival. It emerges that Sahira took the job at the behest of Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry), who she worked under at three previous hospitals. Tasked with managing budget cuts, Hanssen is looking to make staff redundancies, and asks Sahira to report to him on the capability of registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam). Although Greg struggles in an operation, Sahira claims that he is an excellent surgeon. She tells Hanssen that she will not be his spy, and does not want special favours from him in return. Hanssen therefore reneges on his promise to allow Sahira to work flexitime. With a consultant position available, Sahira decides to apply, which pits her against Jac. Greg feels that Sahira is taking liberties by arranging her childcare schedule on duty and delegating patient care to him. He suggests that she is incapable of balancing her personal and professional life, but feels guilty when Sahira subsequently struggles in an operation and is berated by Hanssen. On the day of the consultant interviews, Sahira becomes emotionally involved in a patient's plight and misses her interview slot, so Jac is awarded the position by default. Greg later oversteps Sahira to take the lead on the case of a teenage girl with a rare heart condition. He is devastated when she dies in theatre, and breaks Hanssen's windscreen in a drunken accident. Hanssen issues Greg with a formal warning; Sahira sympathises with him, and when he later makes a medical error, she takes the blame and resultant warning herself. Dismayed that Sahira would tarnish her previously unblemished record for Greg, Hanssen attempts to revive their previously positive working relationship. He offers to remove the warning from her file, and convinces her to join him in an operation she has never performed before, but is forced to call Greg in to assist when she panics in theatre. The operation is ultimately successful, but an angered Sahira tells Hanssen she is unwilling to be his \\"special project\\" any longer. As a result of the hospital's financial difficulties, the cardiothoracic department faces closure. Sahira comes up with an idea for a mobile cardiac unit, which Jac gives her consultant backing to, but double- crosses her by signing a contract with plastic surgeon Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), whose department is encroaching on Darwin. Worried about her future at Holby, Sahira tells Hanssen that she has been offered a job in a Newcastle hospital. When an official visit goes badly, Hanssen is forced to announce the demise of the cardiothoracic department. Sahira is furious, and goes against Hanssen's instructions by taking on an emergency patient, who she unsuccessfully attempts to conceal in the basement. Aware that he could lose her to Newcastle, Hanssen tells Sahira that although her trauma unit proposal is not in the best interests of the hospital or himself, he cannot let her go. Development =Creation and characterisation= Sahira was one of several characters introduced during Holby City thirteenth series, at a time when many established characters were written out. She, along with Hanssen and registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola), were created to compensate for the losses. Series producer Myar Craig-Brown said she wanted the new group to become \\"equally iconic\\" as their predecessors. Sahira was created as an old acquaintance of Hanssen's, and their relationship formed a central focus of the series. She was additionally devised as a love interest for registrar Greg Douglas, and rival to colleague Jac Naylor. BBC Online described Sahira's qualities as being her passionate nature, her warm-heart and her honesty. They said she is flawed by her emotional vulnerability and being a perfectionist. She has the tendency to become emotionally attached to certain patients, which Rouass felt stemmed from her being a working mother. Her situation necessitates balancing her personal and professional lives, and she is depicted as sometimes failing to commit fully to both. Rouass and executive producer Belinda Campbell hoped that viewers would be able to identify with Sahira: the former deemed her situation \\"a reflection on what millions of women are going through now\\", and the latter said that she had been \\"a joy to create\\". Campbell added that while Sahira appeared \\"cool and calm\\", in reality she was \\"kicking madly just to keep afloat\\" and had created a \\"fa√ßade of perfection\\" around herself. Generally well-liked by her colleagues, Rouass said that despite Sahira's rivalry with Jac, she was unlikely to become embroiled in professional discord. She expanded that Sahira is not territorial and prefers to \\"kill people with kindness rather than being in your face or sly.\\" She is good at her job, and Rouass assessed that although Sahira is very ambitious, unlike Jac she is not \\"bitchy about it\\". Instead, \\"her ambition is a silent one and people generally love [and are fascinated] by her\\". =Casting= In November 2010, it was announced that Rouass had been cast as Sahira. After she completed filming on the ITV programme Primeval, Rouass told her agent that the only show she would sign a long-term contract with was Holby City, as she believed it to be \\"so understated in the most positive sense.\\" It was important to Rouass that she loved her character before signing, and explained that if she could not connect with Sahira and was not passionate about creating her, then she feared the role would become just another job. Rouass ultimately joined the show on a one-year contract, the longest she had ever signed. Sahira was created as a woman struggling to balance her career with being a mother, something Rouass was able to relate to as a working mother herself. Rouass, who had no medical expertise prior to her casting, said the role was \\"a real eye opener.\\" She spent a day at The Heart Hospital in London as preparation, and commented in February 2011 that she also hoped to observe a real operation. Rouass felt it was crucial that she liked her character and remained passionate about creating her, otherwise she may not have taken the role on. When asked whether she had much input into the character or storylines, Rouass explained that she had been given a questionnaire to gauge her opinion of Sahira's backstory, and that the creative team were receptive to suggestions. In November 2011, Rouass announced her intention to leave Holby City, in order to spend more time with her daughter. On 8 November, she stated that she would be filming for several more weeks, and that Sahira would remain on-screen until early spring 2012. She did not believe her character would be killed off. =Relationships= Sahira was introduced as a rival for registrar Jac Naylor. Rouass characterised their relationship as a tense one, alleviated by frequent comedic one liners. She called the rivalry a highlight of Sahira's early storylines, noting that the \\"bitchy, catty comments [gave] it a fun element.\\" Rouass explained that although Jac was threatened by Sahira's presence, a mutual ‚Äì albeit silent ‚Äì respect developed as a result of their shared profession. Though Jac had had antagonistic relationships with many of her colleagues beforehand, Katy Moon of Inside Soap assessed that she may have \\"met her match\\" in Sahira when the two competed for a cardiothoracic consultancy. Marcel, who plays Jac, observed that her character's previous competitors had all been male, in contrast to Sahira. She noted that Jac suspected nepotism on Hanssen's part had been responsible for Sahira's hiring, and commented that her character would not allow \\"someone like that\\" to best her. However, when one of Jac's patients later died in theatre, she was surprised that Sahira stood by her; Marcel called Sahira's loyalty \\"quite a moment\\" for Jac. When the future of the cardiothoracic ward was threatened, Jac secretly backed opposing plans by Sahira and Michael. Marcel explained that Jac had her own self-interest at heart: \\"She's on the side she's always been on, which is hers.\\" She refrained from giving advice on a difficult case, \\"hoping Sahira [would] hang herself,\\" however to the surprise of Jac and their colleagues, Sahira performed well and impressed Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen. In October 2010, prior to Sahira's arrival, Guy Henry revealed that his character Hanssen would be mentoring a female doctor and their partnership would carry a \\"hint of unrequited love.\\" It was later revealed that Sahira's backstory included a friendship with Hanssen. She was said to have a \\"dark history\\" with him. Whilst producer Craig-Brown revealed that they had storylines together planned for the whole of series thirteen. By January 2011, Henry confirmed the unrequited love scenario would be applied to Hanssen and Sahira. Rouass said their history was not romantic, just mentorship. Hanssen pushes Sahira as he believed her personal life prevented her from reaching her full potential. She agreed that Hanssen is a \\"big fan\\" of Sahira's work. Henry later revealed Hanssen was attracted to her but saw her more as this \\"wonderful doctor and a bloody good surgeon.\\" The theme of unrequited love remained set in place, as he did not want \\"distract her\\" from her work. Sahira is married with two children. Rouass revealed that her family may be introduced to the series in 2011, and indeed her youngest son Indy appeared in the episode \\"What You Mean By Home\\". In her introductory episode, Sahira stated that she had two sons, however in the later episode \\"Hand In Glove\\", she mentioned having both a son and a daughter. Despite the fact her character is married, Rouass expressed her desire for Sahira to have a romantic relationship with an on-screen character. She hoped that Sahira would become involved in a love triangle as she found many of the male cast members \\"really dishy\\", and noted that being married has \\"never stopped anyone.\\" She assessed that Sahira has \\"plenty of chemistry\\" with her colleague Greg Douglas, which she was looking forward to depicting. In June 2011, Craig-Brown stated that a central focus of series thirteen had been establishing Sahira's character and developing a triangle between herself, Greg and Hanssen. Asked about Sahira's future storylines, Craig-Brown commented, \\"there's been an amazing relationship developing between her and Greg, and it's going to be exacerbated by a blast from Greg's past\\". She said that this would bring the two closer together, but qualified, \\"I don't want it to be a conventional soap or serial drama story about a woman who has an affair, because I think it's not as simple as that. We're trying to mine the difficulties that people face if they fall in love with somebody else.\\" Reception Rouass was nominated in the Drama Performance: Female category at the 2011 National Television Awards for her performance as Sahira. \\"Blue Valentine\\", the episode in which Sahira was introduced, was selected as recommended viewing by the Liverpool Daily Post and Sunday Mercury. Both publications commented on the way she immediately made her presence felt through her interactions with Greg and sparring with Jac. The former additionally called her \\"very attractive and talented\\" and observed that she outshone Jac. The episode drew 5.59 million viewers, down from 6.13 million for the previous episode, however Andrew Laughlin of media news website Digital Spy attributed a rise of 310,000 viewers the following week to the storyline which saw Sahira struggle with her loyalty to Hanssen. Tom Latchem of News of the World said Rouass appeared to be the \\"big name replacement\\" for Patsy Kensit's character Faye Morton. TV presenter Alan Titchmarsh described Sahira as \\"an amazing character\\" because she is \\"head vs heart\\". He also said \\"this is a woman who is a surgeon, but whose emotions are very much to the full.\\" The Daily Mirror Jane Simon approved of the Sahira/Jac double-act, and commented, \\"Watching Sahira (sweet, maternal, human) and Jac (a Dalek in scrubs) hilariously lobbing insults at each other is to witness the start of a beautiful hatred and the scriptwriters are guaranteed to have a lot of fun writing for these two.\\" Once the two began working together on Sahira's Cardiac Trauma Unit, the TVTimes commented, \\"Whisper it, but Sahira and Jac make a great team, with Jac's tough love proving to be what her nemesis needs.\\" In July 2011, What's on TV described Sahira as one of their favourite characters, but called \\"Sirens\\", the episode in which she misses her son's birthday, \\"Not one of the great episodes, if we're honest, as Sahira's attempts to juggle home life and career [...] feel overly contrived.\\" In April 2012, the editor of TVTimes, Ian Abbott said that he would miss \\"smart surgeon Sahira\\". While columnist Joanne Lowles named Sahira's final episode as a four star rated \\"TV Highlight\\" that was \\"memorable for all the wrong reasons\\". She added that it \\"was a shame\\" to see Sahira depart because Rouass had played her \\"brilliantly\\"; describing her exit scenes as a \\"disastrous final surgery and a predictable huge bust-up with Hanssen\\".

Design and development The MC design was based on the general shape of the CT series, but rendered in metal and with a strut-braced wing, in place of the CT series' composite construction and cantilever wing. The design goal was to provide a more robust design, primarily for flight school use. The resulting MC has a lower cruise speed as well as less payload and range than the comparable Flight Design CTLW. The MC was designed to comply with US light- sport aircraft rules. It features a strut-braced high-wing, a two-seats-in- side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The MC's structure is totally different from the CT series. Aircraft fuselage is made from welded steel tubing forming a safety cage around the cockpit, with crumple zones built in. The wings and tail are predominantly aluminum sheet. Its has an area of and flaps. The landing gear legs are composite and are adapted from the CTLS. To simplify fuel management the wing fuel tanks all feed via a single lever fuel supply system. A ballistic parachute is standard equipment.

Biography Franz Samuel Karpe was born in Kranj, Carniola (nowadays Slovenia), to a townsman's family. His parents died soon and subsequently Count Lichteberg's family assumed responsibility for his upbringing and education. Karpe entered a Jesuit college in Ljubljana, which he finished in 1768. In 1769 Karpe moved to Vienna, where he studied law and philosophy. He graduated university in 1773. One year later Karpe assumed position of professor of logic, metaphysics and moral philosophy at the University of Olomouc. In 1777 he became the director of Faculty of Philosophy with pay of 600 gulden a year (for comparison, professor of law Josef Vratislav Monse was paid 900). At the same time he was also assessor at the university's Academic Court. The University was relocated to Brno in years 1778-1782. In Brno, Karpe taught also pedagogy. In 1781 Karpe became the university's Rector. Karpe was ardent admirer of Leibniz and Wolff, but a critic of Kant and advocate of deism and empiricism following Locke. He was one of the few philosophers of the era, who were allowed to be published by the censors of the Vienna court's study commission. In 1786 Karpe became professor of philosophy at University of Vienna, where he remained until his death in 1806. He taught his students in the spirit of Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá and strongly criticised Bo≈°koviƒá's opponent Immanuel Kant.

It was built 1834‚Äì1835, replacing a previous church on the same site. It is an active parish church in the Diocese of Blackburn. Since 1971 it has been designated a Grade II* listed building. History The current church is the third to be built on the site. A church was built in 1770, replacing an older structure of cobbles. The 1770 building was in turn replaced by the current structure, built in 1834‚Äì1835 to a design by W. H. Hobden. It was enlarged in 1872 with the addition of a chancel by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. In 1882 the same partnership added the north aisle, a vestry and the organ chamber, followed by new seating and a new front to the gallery in 1887. The church was further enlarged in 1909. A memorial chapel was added in 1931 by the successors in the practice, Austin and Paley. On 13 January 1971 the church was designated a Grade II* listed building. The Grade II* designation is the second highest of the three grades. St Cuthbert's is an active parish church in the Diocese of Blackburn, the Archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the Deanery of Kirkham. Architecture =Exterior= St Cuthbert's is constructed of dark red brick with sandstone dressings in the Perpendicular style. The roofs are slate. The plan consists of a west tower, a nave with aisles to the north and south, to the east, a chancel and a vestry north of the chancel. There is a small porch at the west end of the south aisle. The tower has diagonal buttresses and three stages. Its parapet is crenellated. It has two-light belfry louvres and a two-light west window. The aisles have three-light windows in the Perpendicular style and the nave clerestory has smaller two-light windows. There are two-light windows in the chancel and the east window is a large three-light window in the Arts and Crafts style. Like the tower, the aisle, nave, porch and chancel walls are crenellated. =Interior and fittings= The tower houses a ring of eight bells, hung in a wooden frame. The church includes monuments to the local Clifton family. St Cuthbert's stained glass includes a window designed in 1860 by Hardman & Co., an 1874 window depicting the Mount of Olives by Morris & Co. as well as work by Charles Eamer Kempe, Jean-Baptiste Capronnier and Clayton and Bell. Churchyard and surroundings The Grade II listed sundial in the churchyard Approximately south-east of the church porch is a sandstone pedestal sundial, undated, but probably from the 18th century. It has a gadrooned base with a fluted collar. The plate and gnomon are coper and the plate is inscribed with \\"Dum spectes fugio\\". The sundial has been given a Grade II designation from English Heritage. The churchyard also contains the war graves of nine service personnel of World War I, and five of World War II. About north of the church there is a monument to the crew of the St Annes-on-Sea lifeboat Laura Janet, who drowned in 1886 in an attempted rescue mission of the Mexico. The monument is constructed of red sandstone and, high, sits on a square plinth of two steps. It is carved with an image of the lifeboat and inscribed with the names of the lost crew members. The monument has also been given a Grade II designation. The vicarage to the west of St Cuthbert's may date from 1836, and may have been designed by W. H. Hobden. It is constructed of red brick in Flemish bond with ashlar dressings in the Elizabethan style. Some features are Jacobean. The vicarage has been designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage.

The upper section of the river is partially navigable to Lubumbashi, a measure of 1000 miles . The large copper deposits of Katanga are conveyed from Elisabethville (Lumbumbashi). The Congo River was an open river in that it was free for all nations to use as per an 1885 international agreement, which was tested by an Oscar Chinn, a British national, in the International Court in 1931.  Congo Free State  The Roi des Belges, the riverboat Joseph Conrad commanded, 1889 The first river steamers on the Congo were two built in sections and hauled overland to the middle river by Henry Morton Stanley the explorer in 1879. Stanley was instrumental in making the area the personal territory of Leopold II. The Oxford Baptist Missionary Society and its chief agent George Grenfell built the steamer Peace for evangelical work in the area in the 1884.Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions Grenfell led both in contact with the natives and charting and exploring the river system. He would later built 2 larger steamers, one called Goodwill. Author Joseph Conrad was the captain of the 'Roi des Belges' Congo steamer which inspired him when he was writing his fiction-novel Heart of Darkness. Conrad was promised a job as a Congo River pilot through the influence of his distant cousin Marguerite Poradowska, who lived in Brussels and knew important officials of the Belgian company which exploited the Congo for its rubber . At this time the Congo, though nominally an independent state, the Congo Free State was the personal property of Leopold II, King of the Belgians, who made a fortune out of it. Later, the appalling abuses involved in the naked colonial exploitation that went on in the Congo Free State were exposed to public view, and international criticism compelled the setting up of a committee of inquiry in 1904 . What Conrad saw in 1890 shocked him profoundly and shook his view of the moral basis of all exploring and trading in newly discovered countries and indeed of civilization in general.  Belgian Congo  As a result of Belgian outrage at the violence brought to the Congo by Leopold II, Belgium reluctantly annexed the Congo Free State as the Belgian Congo in 1908 (conditions quickly improved under fair government control). A portage railway, the Matadi‚ÄìKinshasa Railway was built from Matadi to Leopoldville. Other railways were built around Stanley Falls, and on the rocky sections of the upper Congo. A Congo to Nile Railway was planned to connect Stanleyville with the Nile at Uganda. Over 100 steamers on the river by 1900. British and American missionary societies were sent to spread the gospel and monitor governments . Boat assembly, c. 1912-1915. Transport of palm oil, The Bruges on the background, c. 1941. Mining companies were set up in the copper belt of Katanga Province, and the Societe Maritime de Haut Congo was established. Railways radiated in a star pattern from Katanga, with lines to Angola, Zambia, and halfway to Leopoldville at Ilebo on the Kasai River. Later, ocean maritime empires Compagnie Maritime Belge and airlines, SABENA were formed to serve the colony. Names of the riverboats included: Brugesville, Flandres, Milz, Deliverance, Henry Reed, Kigomi, Tadora, General Olsen, Brabant, and Kitambo. The steamer Bernaert was captured in a civil war of 1892. OTRACO was the office of transport or Belgian government shipping agency on the Congo River after 1936. Gaston Eve commented on traveling by boat during his time in Brazzaville during WWII with the Free French Forces. > \\"The voyage on the Fond√®re was very pleasant.

Bretonnet, Vivi in French Congo and Ubangi River. The north bank of the river was an entirely separate French colony with their own boats . River steamers ran until the 1980s, when the kleptocracy of Mobutu crippled the country.

He then travelled overland to French Congo. Either he or another person contracted then the disease and it subsequently travelled onto the Belgian Congo by steamer. From there the pandemic slowly grew.] Up to 150 people drowned when ferries collided on the river in 2010 .

He is not to be confused with another journalist of the same name, who was the US editor of Melody Maker for much of the 1970s. Journalism career Watts, born in Nottinghamshire and educated at Nottingham High School, began in journalism at age 16 as a reporter on the Nottingham Evening News.Nottingham Evening News, 1955-58 After four years there, he became London editor of The Viewer television magazineThe Viewer, 1959 for a year, before joining the Sunday Express Sunday Express, 1960-86; 1989-91 in 1960. There, he was variously gossip column editor, deputy news editor, and deputy editor in Manchester, and started the paper's Town Talk diary. In 1969 he began The World of Michael Watts, a consumer column laced with social comment and humour. This concluded with the Great Corny Joke Contest, offering a cash prize of a \\"Crisp Oncer\\" - at ¬£1 \\"the meanest prize in Fleet Street\\", and one which became relatively meaner as the years passed. In the 1980s, as the pound coin was replacing the pound note, Watts bought several hundreds of the latter from a bank so that the Crisp Oncer prize could continue. In carrying out investigations and taking up readers' battles with companies and bureaucracy, Michael Watts became known as \\"Inspector Watts\\" - and the column continued for 22 years, until he left the Sunday Express. However, he started the column again in the relaunched London Evening NewsLondon Evening News, 1987 and, the following year, in Saga magazine.Saga,1988-2002 Then in 1989 the Sunday Express asked Watts to bring it back to them, which until 1991 he did.

Her body was found February 14, 2011, wrapped in a plastic garbage bag in the bed of her adoptive father's pickup truck on the side of I-95 in West Palm Beach, Florida. Her body had partially decomposed from being covered in chemicals, possibly pesticides. Her twin brother, Victor Docter Barahona, was in the cab of the truck with his father, suffering seizures from chemical burns and inhalation of toxic gas. Her adoptive parents Jorge and Carmen Barahona were indicted on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and child neglect on March 23, 2011. They face the death penalty if convicted, and are currently under arrest. The case has sparked outrage from Florida citizens and officials regarding the Florida Department of Children and Families' handling of previous allegations of abuse by the Barahonas. Background Fraternal twins Nubia and Victor Docter were born on May 26, 2000, to Sandra K. Docter, a mother with drug and alcohol abuse issues. Their mother had borne four children before them, all of whom had been taken from her by the Department of Children and Families (DCF). Nubia was ‚Äúborn with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which meant her body couldn‚Äôt make two key hormones: the one that helps the body retain salt and another, called cortisol, that helps the body deal with physical stress.‚Äù It was recommended she be placed in a medical foster home, but she was instead allowed to stay with her biological mother, who claimed to be sober. The twins were removed from their mother's care in 2003 and placed with their father, Victor Bustillo, but they did not stay with him long. In 2004 he was charged with sexual battery of a child not in his care. The twins were placed in foster care, and eventually ended up in the home of Jorge and Carmen Barahona in Miami, Florida. The couple had already adopted a boy with autism. Jorge owned a pest control business; Carmen was a homemaker.Just months after being placed with the Barahonas, a nurse noted that Nubia was missing medical appointments because the Barahonas did not wish to accompany her to these, despite the appointments being required to manage Nubia's ongoing condition. The nurse recommended that the Barahonas not be allowed to adopt the children. In 2005, Nubia reportedly told someone at her school that her father was molesting her. Unclear on whether she had meant her birth father or her foster father, DCF investigated. They determined that she had meant her birth father and the case was closed. Then, in 2006, school staff called DCF to report a large bruise on Nubia's face that they suspected was child abuse. The Barahonas were ordered to bring her to an appointment with the Department of Health's Child Protection Team in Miami, but did not show up until a week later. By then, most of the bruising had disappeared and state doctors agreed with the Barahonas' assertion that the bruise was from a fall. Further complaints were filed in 2007: school authorities reported that Nubia was extremely thin, always hungry, and had an unpleasant odor. DCF investigated the claims, but were met with insistence from the Barahonas that Nubia's condition was not from hygiene problems or neglect, but caused by her medical condition. The investigation was dropped. The Barahonas began the adoption process of the twins in 2008, but were met with resistance from the twins' guardian ad litem, Paul Neumann. They claimed Neumann was operating \\"behind [their] backs\\", unfairly interfering with their adoption attempt. They claimed they had a \\"personality conflict\\" with Neumann and cited that as the reason he was accusing them of neglect. To override him, the Barahonas wrote letters appealing to people as high up as then-governor Charlie Crist. In these letters, the Barahonas described the care that they were providing to the twins positively, stating that they were ‚Äúraising [their] children with love, as any mother and father would do.‚Äù The twins were formally adopted in May 2009. In 2010, complaints similar to the ones in 2007 were again raised by school authorities, this time adding that Nubia was losing her hair. DCF was met with the same reasoning from the Barahonas‚Äîthat it was caused by her endocrine condition and medication she was taking for it‚Äîand the investigation was dropped again. \\"Toxic Truck\\" At 5:00 a.m. on Monday, February 14, 2011, a Road Ranger noticed a red Toyota pickup truck on the shoulder of northbound I-95 between Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard and 45th Street in West Palm Beach. When the truck was still there two and a half hours later, he called the police. West Palm Beach Fire Rescue responded to the call and found 53-year-old Jorge Barahona on the ground and 10-year-old Victor Barahona in the cab of the truck. Both were conscious by the time rescuers arrived, but Victor was convulsing with seizures. One fireman was overcome by a strong smell when approaching the truck, and decontamination procedures were started. The bed of the truck was full of plastic containers of chemicals, some unlabeled. The truck was branded with the name of Jorge's pest extermination business, CJ Pest Control, causing investigators to believe the chemicals were pesticides. One unlabeled container held some form of acid, causing firefighters to wonder why an exterminator would have such a chemical. State Troopers were sent to the address of CJ Pest Control, but were unable to contact anyone. Further investigation revealed that Victor was covered in acid, and there was so much of it in the car that it soaked the carpet and seats, making the air around the truck poisonous. Victor and Jorge were taken to separate hospitals for their injuries. A city hazmat team and the state Department of Environmental Protection arrived by the afternoon to decontaminate the area. At about 3:45 p.m., a DEP contractor sorting through tubs of chemicals in the bed of the truck found a black garbage bag. Inside were human remains. FBI investigators joined the effort to decontaminate the site to clear the way for county forensics investigators to examine the body. At about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday the body was taken to the medical examiner's office for an autopsy. The identity of the body was withheld from the public for two days after its discovery, then revealed to be that of Nubia Barahona, Victor's twin sister. Her body was badly decomposed and difficult to identify, as it had been covered with acid and other hazardous chemicals. Investigation Victor was initially taken to nearby St. Mary's Medical Center (West Palm Beach), then transferred two days later to Jackson Memorial Hospital's burn center in Miami. He had suffered \\"severe internal reactions\\" to the inhalation of toxic fumes in the truck, and had chemical burns over large portions of his body. Doctors also found several previous injuries to the boy, including a broken collarbone, broken arm, scars on his buttocks and lower abdomen, and rope marks on both wrists. Victor was finally released on March 2, 2011, and placed in a therapeutic foster home. Jorge was arrested on child abuse charges against Victor and moved from Columbia Hospital (West Palm Beach, Florida) to the Palm Beach County jail on February 16. While in custody, he confessed to police that he had been upset by the death of his daughter and had driven to Palm Beach County with the plan to commit suicide by setting himself on fire. He said the shoulder of I-95 was chosen so that he would be \\"easily found\\". He claimed he gave Victor a handful of sleeping pills, then, with the boy's head in his lap, poured gasoline over his own head. He then attempted to ignite a lighter, but could not do it, as he did not want to take Victor with him. Investigators found a red gasoline container in the truck filled with acid. When asked by police why he did not have as many obvious burns as Victor, Jorge said that some of the gas must have splashed the boy. The police concluded that Jorge's version of events was inconsistent with the boy's injuries. Autopsy results concluded that Nubia was beaten to death on February 11, the day a DCF official came to investigate a call to their abuse hotline. According to the police report, Jorge allegedly \\"repeatedly punched and beat Nubia\\" who \\"screamed and cried until she was dead\\". Carmen Barahona, Jorge's wife, told investigators when questioned that she and her husband had been separated for six months, when in fact they had never been apart. The couple's other two children were taken from the home and placed with Carmen's parents, then placed in foster care. =A \\"family secret\\"= On February 10, 2011, four days before Jorge Barahona's truck was found on the side of the road, the therapist of Carmen Barahona's granddaughter, Alessandra, placed a call to child welfare officials. Alessandra had alleged to her therapist that while visiting her grandmother's house, twins Nubia and Victor were bound by their hands and feet and made to stand for hours in a bathtub. Their hands were unbound only when it was time to eat, she claimed, and she also alleged that she was not permitted to speak to them when she used the bathroom. The therapist told the operator that Alessandra felt threatened by her grandmother to keep quiet. Carmen allegedly told Alessandra not to tell people about how the twins were treated because it was a \\"family secret\\". The couple's 11-year- old autistic son, Jorge, also tried to tell a DCF investigator visiting the home shortly before Nubia's death about a \\"secret\\", but the investigator claimed Carmen dismissed him as \\"low-functioning\\" and told him to watch TV in another room. After the discovery of Nubia's body, Alessandra was removed from the care of her mother, Jennifer Perez, and placed with her father, Yovani Perez. In addition, a judge ordered that neither the girl's mother nor any member of her family have any contact with the girl. A DCF official stated that Alessandra should no longer be with her mother because \\"the mother, Jennifer Perez, not only psychologically abused the child by exposing her to the torture of the twins, but also by threatening the child over and over to keep quiet and encourage her to be complicit in the deception [ ‚Å†. ‚Å†. ‚Å†. ‚Å†] including a calculated effort by the mother to keep the child from disclosing it to DCF officials.\\" =Role of DCF= The Florida Department of Children and Families has been heavily criticized for their handling of the Barahona case. Judge Cindy Lederman expressed outrage at the actions of Andrea Fleary, a DCF worker assigned to the case. On Thursday, February 10, Fleary visited the Barahona home to investigate an abuse hotline call, but despite not making contact with the children, she reported they were safe. When Fleary told the judge about 11-year-old Jorge's attempts to alert her to abuse on Friday, she said the conversations had taken place late in the evening. Judge Lederman responded \\"So we don't do investigations on weekends? Is that what you are telling me?\\" Fleary responded that she had stopped her investigation at 9:00 p.m. because \\"we don't do investigations on weekends.\\" DCF Secretary David Wilkins defended Fleary, claiming she was rattled during the hearing and that \\"[w]e do investigations 24/7 [...] We have employees who work weekends. We have employees who work nights.\\" Fleary was first placed on paid administrative leave, then fired. When asked how they could have ignored signs of Nubia's abuse, such as her hair loss and constant hunger, Wilkins stated that \\"[t]he medical conditions of the children complicated the decision-making of our investigators\\". Wilkins also reminded critics that \\"these people have been deceiving the system for quite a long time\\". In response to the Docter twins being adopted despite objections from their guardian ad litem Paul Neumann, head of Miami-Dade County's guardian ad litem program Sonia Ferrer said the program did everything it could at the time despite admitting Neumann had concerns. She said that the judge overseeing the adoption had heard other evidence and decided to place them with the Barahonas. Wilkins called upon David Lawrence Jr., former publisher of The Miami Herald and current president of the Children's Movement of Florida, Coral Gables attorney Bobby Martinez, a former U.S. Attorney in South Florida, and James Sewell, former assistant commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and chair of the task force that investigated the 2009 death of Broward County foster child Gabriel Myers, to look into the handling of the Barahona case. The panel subsequently called DCF's handling of the case \\"inept\\" and a \\"failure of common sense and listening\\". Wilkins, who had only been DCF secretary for a few months at the time of Nubia's death, has also criticized the organization's abuse hotline, comparing it to a \\"low-cost call center\\". Regarding a call reporting the Barahonas, Wilkins said \\"[t]hey have a low-cost call center mentality ... You don't want to get off the phone in this situation [...] you could tell the operator wanted to get off the phone because he's measured by how long his call is.\\" Employees are rated by how quickly they handle calls because in the past they had been criticized for taking too long to answer calls, causing callers to hang up. Wilkins also claims the technology is outdated, making it difficult to piece together different parts of a case from separate calls. He claimed to have plans to remedy these situations. Charges and trial After being informed he had to attend a hearing on a felony child abuse charge, Jorge Barahona tried twice to injure himself. He first jumped backward off of a sink in his cell, landing on his head. He was examined and declared competent to stand before a judge, but refused to cooperate with deputies and did not show up for the hearing. At the hearing, his bail was set for $1 million. He later attempted again to injure himself and was taken to a hospital for a CT scan, then returned to jail and placed in the mental health unit. Carmen Barahona filed for divorce from Jorge in late February, but was arrested and charged with first-degree murder on March 5. She is being held without bond. Jorge and Carmen Barahona together have been indicted on eighteen charges: one count of first-degree murder, eight counts of child abuse resulting in great bodily harm, one count of child neglect resulting in great harm, six counts of child neglect (no great harm), one count of child neglect (no great bodily harm), and one count of mutilating a dead body. They face the death penalty if convicted. The Barahonas have both pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and child abuse charges. Jorge Barahona's trial on the murder of Nubia and the attempted murder of Victor was set to begin on September 28, 2015. In January 2016, Circuit Judge Samantha Schosberg Feuer set the case for jury selection to start July 25. The case was set to begin in September 2015, but the Barahonas' attorneys requested more time. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the couple.Barahona attempted murder case set for Palm Beach County trial in July The Barahonas' granddaughter, who wished not to be identified, came forward and described the abuse as \\"a persistent pattern of psychological and physical abuse.\\" She was six years old when the twins arrived at the Barahonas' home. The granddaughter was a regular visitor and witnessed the torture of the twins, even stating that \\"the twins would be stripped naked and forced to walk around the living room.\\" Jorge Barahona forced everyone to watch the naked twins. Another time during the granddaughter's visit, Jorge tried to drown Victor in the swimming pool and at another time, Jorge and Carmen wrapped rope around Victor's neck, choking him \\"until he fainted\\". The granddaughter also said that the twins were only given milk and bread to eat.Years later, a child witness fills in disturbing details in infamous Miami abuse case Miami Herald In April of 2017, Victor Barahona received 3.75 million USD from Florida Lawmakers as part of a settlement with the Florida Department of Children and Families.

E. Harvey, was a British Lib-Lab Member of Parliament. Born in Hasland, Derbyshire, Harvey worked in a coal mine from the age of ten. He joined the South Yorkshire Miners' Association (SYMA) in 1869, and was the union's local delegate by 1872. For his trade union activity, he was dismissed from the local pit, but managed to find work at Sheepbridge, then later at Morton. He also converted to Primitive Methodism and in his spare time was a lay preacher.Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.1, pp. 152‚Äì153 In 1880, the Derbyshire-based members of the SYMA split away to form the Derbyshire Miners' Association (DMA), and Harvey became the new union's first treasurer. He resigned in 1882, because union meetings clashed with cricket matches for his employer's team. However, the following year, he was elected as the union's assistant secretary. In 1891, he was elected to the national executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), serving on it in most subsequent years, and in 1894 he was the President of Chesterfield Trades Council. Politically a liberal, strongly opposed to socialism and syndicalism, Harvey became the vice-president of the Labour Electoral Association in 1894. This organisation aimed to secure the election of workers under the auspices of the Liberal Party, and Harvey was elected to Chesterfield Borough Council in 1897, serving until his death. In 1906, Harvey became financial and corresponding secretary of the DMA, and his high-profile secured him the Liberal Party candidacy in the 1907 North East Derbyshire by-election. He was successful, and reluctantly joined the Labour Party in 1910, on the instructions of his union. Despite his seat in Parliament, he remained an active trade unionist, serving as Vice-President of the MFGB from 1912, and as General and Financial Secretary of the DMA from 1913. Harvey became increasingly unhappy with how the Labour party was behaving towards the issue of Miners' representation. In particular he was unhappy with the way Barnet Kenyon was treated during and after the 1913 Chesterfield by-election. He therefore decided to resign the Labour whip and re-took the Liberal whip on 30 March 1914.\\"Politics and the Miner.\\" Times [London, England] 13 May 1914: 5. The Times Digital Archive.

He is best known for his part in the doomed purchase of Notts County Football Club by Munto Finance, a subsidiary of Qadbak Investments, which was the subject of a BBC1 Panorama programme. In July 2018, after several years living in Bahrain, he was extradited to Jersey, where he was charged in the Jersey Royal Court with 25 counts of fraud and larceny. In 2019 he was there sentenced to 6 years imprisonment. Background King first surfaces in the 1980s as chairman of Celebrity Group Holdings, a publishing company based in Kingston, who owned titles such as Basketball Monthly and who were interested in taking over Eddy Shah's newspaper 'The Post' and Hamley's toy shop. They also owned Zodiac Toys, which became insolvent in 1990. Along with his business partner Alan Kingston, King was also a director of Kingston Basketball Club. However, In 1991 King was sentenced to two years in prison for insurance fraud after trying to claim ¬£600,000 for his Aston Martin Zagato after claiming it had been stolen. It was discovered hidden in a garage. Whilst he was in prison Celebrity Group went into liquidation, and were sued for ¬£684000 by Creditcorp, who alleged fraudulent behaviour by Celebrity Group's directors. In the 1990s King was associated with the publicist Max Clifford, and appeared in a controversial episode of Kilroy where Clifford had a fracas with the M.P. Roger Gale. In 2004, he was involved with a sports agency called Essentially Sport, who represented Jenson Button.  Belgravia Financial Services Group  In the mid 2000s, King was involved with a Jersey based company called Belgravia Financial Services Group. After the death of a business partner in 2008, King manipulated an employee of the business into transferring ¬£671,000 from the business into his own personal account. He also sold the late partner's collection of cherished number plates and pocketed the proceeds. When Jersey-based company Close Finance sought repayment of ¬£2m it had loaned to Belgravia, King fled to Bahrain. Swiss Commodity Holding, First London Bank, and Notts County F.C. In 2009 King founded a company called Swiss Commodity Holding, which claimed assets of $2 trillion besides the rights to all the gold, iron ore and coal in North Korea. He then approached British investment bank First London plc, and by falsely claiming he was managing billions of dollars for the Bahraini royal family, he got the bank to turn over 49 per cent of its shares to him. King then acted as head negotiator and consultant for the purchase of Notts County Football Club by Munto Finance, a subsidiary of Qadbak Investments, another company trading on nonexistent connections with wealthy Bahraini families. Although claiming to have had no legal involvement in the scheme, King was able to negotiate the sale of the football club to Munto for ¬£1. He recruited former England football manager Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson as director of football at Notts County, promising him a large sum if he also worked for Swiss Commodity Holding (SCH). He used the nickname of L. Voldemort, after the Harry Potter character Lord Voldemort, and then later claimed that he couldn't have been involved because his name, Russell King, didn't appear in any documents. The club was sold five months after the purchase with debts of ¬£7 million, and First London plc went into administration with debts of ¬£8.7 million. During the time that he was at Notts County, King, representing Swiss Commodity Holding (SCH), visited North Korean Chairman Kim Yong-nam of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang. Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson and Peter Willett joined King on the trip. The purpose of the visit was to persuade the government to hand over gold mining rights in exchange for billions of US dollars allegedly from Bahraini investors. Sauber in 2009, Formula One team Sauber, seeking new investment, encountered Qadbak Investments. The deal collapsed when it was revealed that King was behind the company. Bahraini magazines From around 2013, King operated the Middle East edition of a magazine called Food and Travel using different aliases and claiming false statistics on the publication's circulation numbers. He also launched a magazine called FT Business Arabia, falsely claiming it to be the Middle East version of the Financial Times in order to obtain millions of dollars in advertising revenue. He also benefited from barter deals with top hospitality groups and luxury retail brands in the UAE. 2018 fraud and larceny charges In 2018 King was extradited from Bahrain to Jersey, and on 27 July 2018, King was charged in the Jersey Royal Court with 25 counts of fraud and larceny that occurred while he was living in Jersey in 2008.

Crown Advocate Matthew Jowitt stated \\"It is alleged the misappropriation is something in the order of ¬£16 million pounds.\\" On 7 August 2018, it was reported that due to the complexity of the case and the speed at which events had happened, the bailiff, Sir William Bailhache, adjourned the case for three weeks, at which point pleas would be entered. In April 2019 King was sentenced to six years imprisonment for stealing ¬£670000 from the Belgravia Group in 2008, and in August 2019 he was told to pay back ¬£320000 or face additional time in jail.

He was a member of the Lebanese parliament for twenty-four consecutive years (1968‚Äì1992) representing the district of Ashrafieh, Beirut. He served several times as Vice-Prime Minister, Deputy Speaker of Parliament, and cabinet Minister. He founded the Ministry of Housing and Cooperatives, and was appointed as Minister of Labor, Tourism and others in more than seven governments. Throughout his political career he was renowned for his strong ethics and anti-corruption principles. He took the lead on several historic turning points including the 1970 Presidential election, and the Taif Agreement in 1990. Personal life Sassine was born to a prominent Greek Orthodox family in Ashrafieh to parents Georges Sassine and Laurice Bustros. He lost his father in his teenage years and found himself responsible for four other siblings including new-born twins. Sassine led his family into politics, and together with his brothers Pierre and Joseph dedicated the family's efforts to public service. 1968 Parliamentary elections Michel Sassine and Nasri Maalouf winning 1968 elelctions Michel Sassine winning the 1968 elelctions Michel Sassine was first elected to the Lebanese Parliament in 1968 running for the Greek Orthodox seat in the nation's capital Beirut. Sassine ran alongside Nasri Maalouf and together, as independents, won against the government-backed coalition led by Sheikh Pierre Gemayel - including Minister of Foreign Affairs Fouad Boutros. 1970 Presidential elections Deputy Speaker Michel Sassine declaring Suleiman Franjieh President of Lebanon in 1970 In the closest and possibly most controversial presidential election in Lebanese history, Suleiman Frangieh was elected President of the Republic by the National Assembly on 17 August 1970, with a majority of one single vote. The presidency being the most powerful political institution in pre-1990 Lebanon the presidential race was of particular importance as it came after 12 years of continuous Shihabist rule (Fuad Shihab 1958-1964, and Charles Helou, 1964‚Äì1970). The two main opposing candidates emerged to be Elias Sarkis ‚Äì then Governor of the Central Bank ‚Äì backed by the Shihabi regime; and Suleiman Frangieh backed by the opposition. On the third voting round, Frangieh received majority by a single vote over Elias Sarkis. Sabri Hamadeh, then Speaker of Parliament and supporter of the Shihab regime, refused to announce the election of a President on such a low margin, and walked out of Parliament. Michel Sassine, Deputy Speaker of Parliament, stepped up and assumed the responsibilities of Speaker and announced Frangieh President in a move that saved the country of an inevitable political vacuum.(See two additional pictures of Sassine announcing Frangieh President:, ) Sassine moved to serve as Minister and Vice-Prime Minister in the four different governments between 1972-1975 under the mandate of President Frangieh. His relationship with President Camille Chamoun Vice-Prime Minister Michel Sassine with President Camille Chamoun and his son Dany Chamoun Michel Sassine initially got elected as an independent and was never part of any political party throughout his career. Nevertheless, he developed a close political and personal relationship with President Camille Chamoun, and took a leading role in the National Liberal Party (Lebanon) (Al Ahrar) parliamentary block until the death of Chamoun's son Dany in 1990. Role in Taif Agreement Sassine was a signatory of the Taif Agreement that ended the Lebanese Civil War. He was serving as Deputy Speaker of Parliament when Parliament signed the agreement on 22 October 1989 and ratified it on 4 November 1989. In the post- Taif period Sassine was appointed Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Labor in both the 1990-1992 governments of Salim al-Hoss, and Omar Karami. Other Achievements Deputy Speaker Sassine presiding the Lebanese Parliament * Exercised full powers of Vice-Prime Minister and Deputy Speaker of Parliament: as Sassine occupied the highest positions allocated to Greek Orthodox in the Lebanese sectarian system he remains one of the few to have exercised the full power of these offices, as they remain symbolic otherwise. Other than his role in the 1970 Presidential elections, he acted as Speaker of Parliament on numerous occasions and led parliament on many junctures to pass significant reforms. Sassine's ability to exercise the Greek Orthodox Deputy responsibilities was due to both strong political backing and personal character. * Saved 24 Lebanese from execution in Guinea: in the early 1970s thirteen Lebanese were sentenced to death in Africa's Guinea in an attempted coup against President Ahmed Sekou Toure. As the execution order was to be carried a week after their arrest, and many mediation efforts for their release failed, President Suleiman Frangieh tasked Michel Sassine, then Vice- Prime Minister, on an urgent diplomatic mission to Guinea. Sassine succeeded in his intervention as Sekou Toure agreed to issue a Presidential pardon and handed all thirteen Lebanese detainees to Sassine to bring back to Lebanon. Association to Sassine Square Sassine Square in Ashrafieh is one of the most prominent political, social and commercial focal points of the Lebanese capital. While Sassine Street was named after Michel Sassine's father Georges in the 1940s, Michel Sassine moved to get Sassine Square officially inaugurated in the early 1990s under the auspices of President Elias Hrawi and Prime-Minister Rafic Hariri.

Smith was a British trade unionist. Born in Coalville, Leicestershire in 1882 or 1883, Smith worked at Linby Colliery from the age of thirteen. He joined the Nottinghamshire Miners' Association (NMA) and quickly became a key supporter of Herbert Booth, and he joined the British Socialist Party.Colin Griffin, The Leicestershire Miners, Vol. II, pp. 115-117 Smith later moved to Hucknall, where he stood for the Labour Party in local elections. He frequently came into dispute with the leadership of the NMA and, on one occasion, he broke the windows of their headquarters. Perhaps for this reason, he moved to Ellistown in Coalville, where he was elected agent for the Leicestershire Miners' Association (LMA), replacing Levi Lovett, and he was soon elected onto the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), where he was a supporter of A. J. Cook. He organised swimming galas in the town, participating himself. During the 1926 United Kingdom general strike, and the miners' strike which followed, Smith organised a fundraising caravan tour, where he spoke alongside the comedian Billy Burton.Colin Griffin, The Leicestershire Miners, Vol.II, p.179 However, this was unpopular with some union members, who felt that he should be more involved in union business in the county. Although he returned, he went on a short awareness-raising tour of Russia in November. Through these activities, he split with the majority of his union's executive, in particular, the right- wing secretary Tom Gowdridge, who had encouraged miners to return to work.Colin Griffin, The Leicestershire Miners, Vol. II, pp. 207-218 The strike concluded by the end of the year, and Gowdridge announced that the union could no longer afford to pay an agent. Smith was upset by what he saw as political manoeuvering, and the de-politicisation of the union. He resigned and formed the rival \\"New Miners' Union\\" in January 1927, immediately attracting somewhere between one hundred and 250 members, in a similar fashion to the later creation of the United Mineworkers of Scotland. He asked that his organisation be permitted to affiliate to the MFGB, but Cook instead decided that the two rival unions should be reunited. Smith disbanded his union in March, on condition that the LMA hold an election for a new agent, and accept his candidacy for the post. Gowdridge ultimately did not hold an election, and the unemployed Smith instead moved to Leicester and set up an ice cream- selling business. This not a success, and he moved on to London, where he slept rough, before returning to Coalville. Although, on his return, Smith had no formal organisation of supporters, he retained considerable sympathy among the rank-and-file miners, and he organised well-attended political meetings. He spoke forcefully against Gowdridge and, in 1934, he was in the news for threatening to break the LMA's office windows. By this time, he was well known as a poacher, but also worked legally, sweeping streets and undertaking general labouring. In 1936, the LMA finally held an election for a new agent, judging correctly that Smith no longer had sufficient support to be elected - despite campaigning, he failed to be nominated by a single branch.

Background and legislation In January 2000, following the devolution of the Scottish Parliament the previous year, Justice Minister Jim Wallace announced proposals to reform family law in Scotland, which would include new legislation on domestic abuse. Plans to increase protection for victims of domestic violence were temporarily delayed but the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) bill was published in June 2001 and was subsequently passed by the parliament on 4 October. The act received Royal Assent on 6 November. The act allows interdicts to be brought against abusers by their victims and gives the police the power to arrest and charge an individual who breaks such an interdict. By giving the police this new power, the act amends the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981. The 2001 act was intended to extend protection to victims of domestic abuse by unmarried and same-sex partners, as well as those no longer in a relationship with their abuser.

The Club was founded on 9 October 1924. Since 1993 HBU have won 16 of the 20 English NRHA Premier League championships (more than any other club), winning their last one in the 2009-10 Season. The Club have also won 12 National Cup titles - the only teams winning more being Herne Bay RHC and Southsea RHC. History Herne Bay United Roller Hockey Club was formed on 9 October 1924 with hockey, dance and speed sections. It expanded rapidly and swiftly became the most popular and best supported of all clubs. Today it still flourishes as the country‚Äôs premier club with numbers and trophies won increasing constantly. The club came about mainly because the existing Herne Bay Club had become too large and the ‚ÄòSecond‚Äô team wished to play in more prestigious competitions. The breakaway players soon established the Pier Pavilion as a home base and even requested one stand to be their own so that their supporters would not have to sit with the Herne Bay followers. Over the next few years United quickly became a major force competing in, and winning, tournaments throughout England and continental Europe with regular trips to Belgium and France along with the occasional longer train trip to Montreux, Switzerland. Although the war resulted in a number of lost years United continued to flourish with a peak membership of 468 in May 1948. On the rink the team continued to win tournaments but much to the chagrin of players and supporters alike Herne Bay seemed to have the edge in the regular ‚ÄòDerby‚Äô matches. It has not been all plain sailing for United as the Pier Pavilion burning down nearly caused the club to fold. However, a few hardy individuals persevered to begin to mould the club into the success it is today. Currently the club has teams at every level from under 9‚Ä≤s through to a Senior team competing in the National Premier League. This is far and away the most successful period in the club‚Äôs illustrious history with the 1st team having won the league 16 times in the last 20 years. Couple this with the highly successful youth section and hopefully the club can make it to its centenary at the top of English roller hockey.

While experts from a range of professions move in and out of various projects, the core members of Workingman Collective are Tom Ashcraft, Janis Goodman, and Peter Winant. Founded in 2005, Workingman Collective is based in the Washington, D.C. area and has exhibited work and created projects in the public domain in the U.S, Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean. Represented by Hemphill Fine Arts Workingman Collective pushes past the idea of the masterwork and its singular vision, into projects that explore the nature of collaboration and cooperation. For the Collective the viewer‚Äôs participation is tantamount. The process employed moves through stages from the collection of information to the construction of an object or situation to the participation of the audience. Typically participation alters the process, producing new information that is integrated into the art experience. Workingman Collective‚Äôs projects have worked to generate environmental awareness, stimulate the re-identification of a population with its hometown history, and urged participates into strengthening relationships with their neighbors. Workingman Collective is interested in process, invention, chance, and the public. Projects In 2006 Workingman Collective created \\"Five Mile Line\\", a temporary public work consisting of a five-mile long contractors chalk-line snapped/drawn through the city of Butte, Montana. In 2008 Workingman Collective in partnership with the Shenandoah and Potomac Garden Railway Club exhibited \\"Synchrony\\" at the Delaplaine Visual Art Center, Frederick, Maryland. In response to a series of meetings with people from Tenants and Workers United, a prototype for a mobile community center was built as the project \\"Building a Mobile Community Center, 2009\\" in Falls Church, Virginia, in collaboration with representatives of the Day Workers of Culmore in Falls Church, The Working Man Collective, and the Floating Lab Collective. In 2011 Workingman Collective exhibited \\"Prospects and Provisions\\" at Hemphill Fine Arts, Washington, D.C. The exhibition installation included an original backpack designed and patented by Trapper Lloyd F. Nelson in 1924 (U.S. patent #1,505,661). The backpack served as the launching point for Workingman Collective's creation of a variety of provisions for the modern adventurer, including seven custom designed backpacks based on the original Trapper Nelson patent. The exhibition also included \\"Swing\\", a steel swing w/wooden bench covered with a selection of plants from Environmental Scientist Bill Woverton's study on plants that clean the air of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and \\"Table, a custom work table and seating with a G scale train traveling on an overhead elevated oval track. In addition to the objects in the exhibition there were weekly \\"lunch\\" at the \\"Table\\" discussions open to and engaging with the public. 2011, February and July, Workingman Collective worked in Haiti with the International Center for Disaster Resilience. Workingman Collective worked directly in orphanages building tables and chalkboard walls to operate as social spaces for communication and interaction, and also met with Haitian artists to consider options for creative treatments and artwork potential at the National Sports Center located in Port-au-Prince, Croix des Bouquets.

Loving Jr. (September 19, 1935 ‚Äì June 21, 2005), better known as Al Loving, was an African-American abstract expressionist painter. His work is known for hard-edge abstraction, fabric constructions, and large paper collages, all exploring complicated color relationships. Biography Alvin Demar Loving Jr. was born on September 19, 1935 in Detroit, Michigan. Loving earned a BFA from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1963 and an MFA from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. His mentor at the University of Michigan was Al Mullen, who helped him get involved with the Once Group organization. In 1968 Loving moved to New York City, where he moved into the infamous Hotel Chelsea. Nykolak, Jenevieve. \\"Al Loving\\", National Gallery of Art, Retrieved 4 January 2019. Within a year of moving to New York City, Loving had his first solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art. He received National Endowment for the Arts fellowships in 1970, 1974, and 1984. In 1986 Loving was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.\\"Alving Loving\\", John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, Retrieved 4 January 2019. Loving created large-scale commissioned public works throughout his career; a 208' x 80' mural painting A Message to Demar and Lauri (1972) on The First National Bank Building in Detroit, MI (removed 1989), a 54' x 7' painting New Morning 1 (1973) for the Empire State Collection in Albany, NY, a ceramic mural Detroit New Morning (1987) in one of Detroit's People Mover stations and another Life, Growth, Continuity (1998) in the David Adamany Library at Wayne State University. In 1996, he created a collage painting Sacramento New Morning for the Sacramento Convention Center, and in 2001 he designed 70 stained-glass windows and mosaic walls for the Broadway Junction subway station in Brooklyn. Loving exhibited steadily throughout his life in solo and group exhibitions at numerous venues, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Studio Museum in Harlem; Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase, New York; Fondation Maeght, Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France; and PS1 Contemporary Art Center, Queens, New York. Loving died on June 21, 2005 in New York, New York. Artistic Style =Hard-Edge Abstraction= In the 1960s, Loving grew increasingly interested in Josef Albers's paintings of squares within squares. Yau, John. \\"Out of the Box: Al Loving's Great Achievement\\", Hyperallergic, Retrieved 4 January 2019. In an interview, he explained: \\"For me at the time, it was about painting the square until it was 'enough,' and that meant until it obtained form. The square that I started with would always be gone; only I knew it was a square, that that reference was there. That freed me to just paint and let things evolve...[The square] was pure energy and focus.‚Äù These geometric abstractions conveyed the brilliance of refracted light; they were not just experiments in color. Loving would often make polyhedrons of the same size, with different colors, and hang them together in different arrangements on the wall. The result was sometimes dozens of canvases stretching out over several feet; to view an entire composition would take time, more than just a glance, making his paintings a powerful expression of time, too. Loving's geometric paintings were featured in his first solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Loving later abandoned hard-edged abstraction painting. =Fabric Constructions= Inspired by a visit to the Whitney Museum of American Art's exhibition Abstract Design in American Quilts, in the early 1970s, Loving began to experiment with fabric constructions. He started hanging strips of canvas from the walls and ceilings, playing with our perception of pictorial and sculptural ideals. Then, he reattached the fragments together with a sewing machine, creating large flowing fabric constructions. At first he painted the pieces of canvas, but later switched to dying the fabric. Other artists, including Sam Gilliam, Alan Shields, and Richard Moch, were also using the sewing machine at this time to create fabric constructions. In fact, Loving considered himself within the context of abstract expressionism at this phase in his career; though he was not a painter but a material abstractionist. =Large Paper Collages= In the 1980s, Loving began to integrate other materials into his constructions, such as corrugated cardboard and rag paper. Loving quickly took a liking to the casualness of tearing cardboard and gluing it onto other pieces; in fact, he considered this practice abstract expressionist as well. Unlike the fabric constructions, the large paper collages gave him a sense of freedom because he was trekking through uncharted territory (although this work has been likened to Frank Stella's curvilinear metal reliefs and Elizabeth Murray's shaped canvases). Loving integrated circles and spirals into these collages as a nod to his African roots and as an expression of growth and continued life. In the piece, Perpetual Motion (1994)(DASNY), Loving integrated materials such as cardboard and print. The cardboard is cut and overlapped to form a series of spirals. Each spiral has been carefully painted and placed to create dynamic color relationships. They do not have conventional matting under them, glass to cover them or frames to surround them: instead they cling flatly to the wall. Sandra Yolles, reviewing an exhibition in 1990, explained \\"Loving‚Äôs work is about earth, wind, fire, and water: some pieces might be considered atmospheric maps of life at full blast‚Äîstretching the possibilities of the human spirit by delineating its directions, currents, and eddies.'‚Äù Exhibition History =Solo Exhibitions= 1969 *Alvin Loving, Gertrude Kasle Gallery, Detroit, June 15‚ÄìJuly 7 1969‚Äì1970 *Alvin Loving: Paintings, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, December 19, 1969 ‚Äì January 25, 1970 1973 *Alvin Loving, William Zierler, Inc., New York, March 11‚ÄìApril 1 1977 *The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York 1986 *Al Loving: Departures, The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, February 23‚ÄìJune 8 1991 *Al Loving: Maker of Art, National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., April 10‚ÄìJune 15 1992 *Al Loving: Material Abstraction, June Kelly Gallery, New York, November 5‚ÄìDecember 1 1997 *Al Loving in the Nineties: The Collaged Wallworks, Fine Arts Center Galleries, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, January 21‚ÄìMarch 8 1998 *Al Loving: Detwiller Visiting Artist, Art Gallery, Williams Center for the Arts, Lafayette College, February 6‚ÄìMarch 1 1998‚Äì1999 *Al Loving: Color Constructs, Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase College, State University of New York, September 27, 1998 ‚Äì January 24, 1999 1999 *Al Loving: Elegant Ideas, G.R.

Although there are numerous definitions of pain, almost all involve two key components. First, nociception is required. This is the ability to detect noxious stimuli which evokes a reflex response that moves the entire animal, or the affected part of its body, away from the source of the stimulus. The concept of nociception does not imply any adverse, subjective feeling; it is a reflex action. The second component is the experience of \\"pain\\" itself, or suffering‚Äîi.e., the internal, emotional interpretation of the nociceptive experience. Pain is therefore a private, emotional experience. Pain cannot be directly measured in other animals, including other humans; responses to putatively painful stimuli can be measured, but not the experience itself. To address this problem when assessing the capacity of other species to experience pain, argument-by- analogy is used. This is based on the principle that if a non-human animal's responses to stimuli are similar to those of humans, it is likely to have had an analogous experience. It has been argued that if a pin is stuck in a chimpanzee's finger and they rapidly withdraw their hand, then argument-by- analogy implies that like humans, they felt pain. It has been questioned why the inference does not then follow that a cockroach experiences pain when it writhes after being stuck with a pin.Sherwin, C.M., (2001). Can invertebrates suffer? Or, how robust is argument-by-analogy? Animal Welfare, 10 (supplement): S103-S118 This argument-by-analogy approach to the concept of pain in invertebrates has been followed by others. The ability to experience nociception has been subject to natural selection and offers the advantage of reducing further harm to the organism. While it might be expected therefore that nociception is widespread and robust, nociception varies across species. For example, the chemical capsaicin is commonly used as a noxious stimulus in experiments with mammals; however, the African naked mole-rat, Heterocephalus glaber, an unusual rodent species that lacks pain-related neuropeptides (e.g., substance P) in cutaneous sensory fibres, shows a unique and remarkable lack of pain-related behaviours to acid and capsaicin. Similarly, capsaicin triggers nociceptors in some invertebrates, but this substance is not noxious to Drosophila melanogaster (the common fruit fly). Criteria that may indicate a potential for experiencing pain include: # Has a suitable nervous system and receptors # Physiological changes to noxious stimuli # Displays protective motor reactions that might include reduced use of an affected area such as limping, rubbing, holding or autotomy # Has opioid receptors and shows reduced responses to noxious stimuli when given analgesics and local anaesthetics # Shows trade-offs between stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements # Shows avoidance learning # Exhibits high cognitive ability and sentience Suitable nervous system =Central nervous system= Brain size does not necessarily equate to complexity of function. Moreover, weight for body-weight, the cephalopod brain is in the same size bracket as the vertebrate brain, smaller than that of birds and mammals, but as big or bigger than most fish brains.Cephalopod brain size Internal anatomy of a spider, showing the central nervous system in blue Invertebrate nervous systems are very unlike those of vertebrates and this dissimilarity has sometimes been used to reject the possibility of a pain experience in invertebrates. In humans, the neocortex of the brain has a central role in pain and it has been argued that any species lacking this structure will therefore be incapable of feeling pain. However, it is possible that different structures may be involved in the pain experience of other animals in the way that, for example, crustacean decapods have vision despite lacking a human visual cortex. The octopus Amphioctopus marginatus Two groups of invertebrates have notably complex brains: arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and others) and modern cephalopods (octopuses, squid, cuttlefish) and other molluscs. The brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through the body of the animal. Arthropods have a central brain with three divisions and large optic lobes behind each eye for visual processing. The brains of the modern cephalopods in particular are highly developed, comparable in complexity to the brains of some vertebrates (See also: Invertebrate brains). Emerging results suggest that a convergent evolutionary process has led to the selection of vertebrate-like neural organization and activity-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in these invertebrates. Cephalopods stand out by having a central nervous system that shares prime electrophysiological and neuroanatomical features with vertebrates like no other invertebrate taxon. =Nociceptors= Medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis Nociceptors are sensory receptors that respond to potentially damaging stimuli by sending nerve signals to the brain. Although these neurons in invertebrates may have different pathways and relationships to the central nervous system than mammalian nociceptors, nociceptive neurons in invertebrates often fire in response to similar stimuli as mammals, such as high temperature (40 C or more), low pH, capsaicin, and tissue damage. The first invertebrate in which a nociceptive cell was identified was the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, which has the characteristic segmented body of an Annelida, each segment possessing a ganglion containing the T (touch), P (pressure) and N (noxious) cells. Later studies on the responses of leech neurones to mechanical, chemical and thermal stimulation motivated researchers to write \\"These properties are typical of mammalian polymodal nociceptors\\". A sea hare There have been numerous studies of learning and memory using nociceptors in the sea hare, Aplysia. Many of these have focused on mechanosensory neurons innervating the siphon and having their somata (bulbous end) in the abdominal ganglion (LE cells). These LE cells display increasing discharge to increasing pressures, with maximal activation by crushing or tearing stimuli that cause tissue injury. Therefore, they satisfy accepted definitions of nociceptors. They also show similarities to vertebrate AŒ¥ nociceptors, including a property apparently unique (among primary afferents) to nociceptors ‚Äî sensitization by noxious stimulation. Either pinching or pinning the siphon decreased the threshold of the LE cells firing and enhanced soma excitability. Nociceptors have been identified in a wide range of invertebrate species, including annelids, molluscs, nematodes and arthropods. Physiological changes In vertebrates, potentially painful stimuli typically produce vegetative modifications such as tachycardia, pupil dilation, defecation, arteriole blood gases, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and changes in blood flow, respiratory patterns, and endocrine. The crayfish Procambarus clarkii At the cellular level, injury or wounding of invertebrates leads to the directed migration and accumulation of haematocytes (defence cells) and neuronal plasticity, much the same as the responses of human patients undergoing surgery or after injury.Clatworthy, A.L., (1996). A simple systems approach to neural-immune communication. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, 115A: 1-10 In one study, heart rate in the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, decreased following claw autotomy during an aggressive encounter. Recording physiological changes in invertebrates in response to noxious stimuli will enhance the findings of behavioural observations and such studies should be encouraged. However, careful control is required because physiological changes can occur due to noxious, but non-pain related events, e.g. cardiac and respiratory activity in crustaceans is highly sensitive and responds to changes in water level, various chemicals and activity during aggressive encounters. Protective motor reactions Invertebrates show a wide range of protective reactions to putatively painful stimuli. However, even unicellular animals will show protective responses to, for example, extremes of temperature. Many invertebrate protective reactions appear stereotyped and reflexive in action, perhaps indicating a nociceptive response rather than one of pain, but other responses are more plastic, especially when competing with other motivational systems (see section below), indicating a pain response analogous to that of vertebrates. =Mechanical stimulation= Rather than a simple withdrawal reflex, the flatworm, Notoplana aticola, displays a locomotory escape behaviour following pin pricks to the posterior end. Touching the larvae of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, with a probe causes them to pause and move away from the stimulus, however, stronger mechanical stimulation evokes a more complex corkscrew-like rolling behaviour, i.e. the response is plastic. When a weak tactile stimulus is applied to the siphon of the sea-hare Aplysia californica, the animal rapidly withdraws the siphon between the parapodia. It is sometimes claimed this response is an involuntary reflex (e.g. see Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex), however, the complex learning associated with this response (see 'Learned Avoidance' below) suggests this view might be overly simplistic. In 2001, Walters and colleagues published a report that described the escape responses of the tobacco hornworm caterpillar (Manduca sexta) to mechanical stimulation. These responses, particularly their plasticity, were remarkably similar to vertebrate escape responses. Tobacco hornworm larva, Manduca sexta =Autotomy= Over 200 species of invertebrates are capable of using autotomy (self amputation) as an avoidance or protective behaviour including - * land slugs (Prophysaon)McDonnel, R.J., Paine, T.D. and Gormally, M.J., (2009). Slugs: A Guide to the Invasive and Native Fauna of California . 21 pp., , page 9. * sea snails (Oxynoe panamensis) * crickets * spiders * crabs * lobsters * octopuses These animals can voluntarily shed appendages when necessary for survival. Autotomy can occur in response to chemical, thermal and electrical stimulation, but is perhaps most frequently a response to mechanical stimulation during capture by a predator. Autotomy serves either to improve the chances of escape or to reduce further damage occurring to the remainder of the animal such as the spread of a chemical toxin after being stung, but the 'decision' to shed a limb or part of a body and the considerable costs incurred by this suggests a pain response rather than simply a nociceptive reflex. =Thermal stimulation= A heated probe (¬ª) evokes a complex, corkscrew-like rolling avoidance behaviour in Drosophila larvae which occurs in as little as 0.4 seconds; a non-heated probe does not cause this avoidance behaviour. In contrast, cold stimuli (‚â§14¬∞C or 57.2¬∞F) primarily elicit a bilateral full-body contraction along the head-to-tail axis; larvae might also respond by lifting their head and/or tail, but these responses occur less frequently with decreasing temperatures. Land snails show an avoidance response to being placed on a hotplate (¬ª) by lifting the anterior portion of the extended foot. A 2015 study found that crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) respond adversely to high temperatures, but not to low temperatures. =Chemical stimulation= Crustaceans are known to respond to acids in ways that indicate nociception and/or pain. The prawn Palaemon elegans shows protective motor reactions when their antennae are treated with the irritants acetic acid or sodium hydroxide. The prawns specifically groom the treated antennae and rub them against the tank, showing they are aware of the location of the noxious stimulus on their body rather than exhibiting a generalised response to stimulation. In _Carcinus maenas_ , the common shore crab, acetic acid induces a number of behavioral changes, including movement of the mouthparts, rubbing with the claws, and increased attempts to escape from an enclosure. stinger, with droplet of venom Under natural conditions, orb- weaving spiders (Argiope spp.) undergo autotomy (self-amputation) if they are stung in a leg by wasps or bees. Under experimental conditions, when spiders were injected in the leg with bee or wasp venom, they shed this appendage. But if they are injected with only saline, they rarely autotomize the leg, indicating it is not the physical insult or the ingress of fluid per se that causes autotomy. Spiders injected with venom components which cause injected humans to report pain (serotonin, histamine, phospholipase A2 and melittin) autotomize the leg, but if the injections contain venom components which do not cause pain to humans, autotomy does not occur. _Drosophila melanogaster_ larvae respond to acids and menthol with a stereotyped nociceptive rolling response, identical to the behavior seen in response to high-temperature and mechanical insult. The electrophilic chemical allyl isothiocyanate causes nociceptive sensitization in larvae. Adult flies find menthol, AITC, capsaicin, and a number of other chemicals to be aversive, affecting both the proboscis extension reflex and egg-lay site preference. Acids are also known to activate nociceptors in the nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_ and in _Hirudo medicinalis_ , commonly known as the medicinal leech. =Electrical stimulation= The sea-slug, Tritonia diomedia, possesses a group of sensory cells, \\"S-cells\\", situated in the pleural ganglia, which initiate escape swimming if stimulated by electric shock. Similarly, the mantis shrimp Squilla mantis shows avoidance of electric shocks with a strong tail-flick escape response. Both these responses appear to be rather fixed and reflexive, however, other studies indicate a range of invertebrates exhibit considerably more plastic responses to electric shocks. Because of their soft bodies, hermit crabs rely on shells for their survival, but, when they are given small electric shocks within their shells, they evacuate these. The response, however, is influenced by the attractiveness of the shell; more preferred shells are only evacuated when the crabs are given a higher voltage shock, indicating this is not a simple, reflex behaviour. In studies on learning and the Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex, Aplysia received an electric shock on the siphon each time their gill relaxed below a criterion level. Aplysia learned to keep their gills contracted above the criterion level‚Äîan unlikely outcome if the response was due to a nociceptive experience. Drosophila feature widely in studies of invertebrate nociception and pain. It has been known since 1974Quinn, W.G., Harris, W.A. and Benzer, S., (1974). Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA 71: 708-712 that these fruit-flies can be trained with sequential presentations of an odour and electric shock (odour‚Äìshock training) and will subsequently avoid the odour because it predicts something \\"bad\\". A similar response has been found in the larvae of this species. In an intriguing study, Drosophila learned two kinds of prediction regarding a 'traumatic' experience. If an odour preceded an electric shock during training, it predicted shock and the flies subsequently avoided it. When the sequence of events during training was reversed, i.e. odour followed shock, the odour predicted relief from shock and flies approached it. The authors termed this latter effect \\"relief\\" learning. Many invertebrate species learn to withdraw from, or alter their behaviour in response to, a conditioned stimulus when this has been previously paired with an electric shock‚Äîcited by Sherwin‚Äîand include snails, leeches, locusts, bees and various marine molluscs. If vertebrate species are used in studies on protective or motor behaviour and they respond in similar ways to those described above, it is usually assumed that the learning process is based on the animal experiencing a sensation of pain or discomfort from the stimulus, e.g. an electric shock. Argument-by-analogy suggests an analogous experience occurs in invertebrates. Opioid receptors, effects of local anaesthetics or analgesics In vertebrates, opiates modulate nociception and opioid receptor antagonists, e.g. naloxone and CTOP, reverse this effect. So, if opiates have similar effects in invertebrates as vertebrates, they should delay or reduce any protective response and the opioid antagonist should counteract this. It has been found that molluscs and insects have opioid binding sites or opioid general sensitivity. Certainly there are many examples of neuropeptides involved in vertebrate pain responses being found in invertebrates; for example, endorphins have been found in platyhelminthes, molluscs, annelids, crustaceans and insects. Apart from analgesia, there are other effects of exogenous opiates specifically being involved in feeding behaviour and activation of immunocytes. These latter functions might explain the presence of opioids and opioid receptors in extremely simple invertebrates and unicellular animals. =Nematodes= Movement of wild-type C. elegans Nematodes avoid extremes of temperature. Morphine increases the latency of this defensive response in the parasitic Ascaris suum. In a study on the effects of opiates in Caenorhabditis elegans, 76% of a non-treated group exhibited a rapid, reflexive withdrawal to heat, whereas 47%, 36% and 39% of morphine, endomorphin 1 and endomorphin 2 treated worms (respectively) withdrew. These effects were reversed with the opioid receptor antagonists naloxone and CTOP, leading the authors to conclude that thermonocifensive behaviour in C. elegans was modulated by opioids. =Molluscs= Helix pomatia, a species of land snail Slugs and snails have an opioid receptor system.Dalton, L.M. and Widdowson, P.S., (1989). The involvement of opioid peptides in stress-induced analgesia in the slug Arion ater. Peptides:, 10:9-13 In experiments on different terrestrial snails, morphine prolonged the latency of the snails' raising their foot in response to being placed on a hot (40 ¬∞C) surface. The analgesic effects of the morphine were eliminated by naloxone as is seen in humans and other vertebrates. There was also habituation to morphine. Snails administered with morphine for four days did not differ from the control ones in tests on pain sensitivity and analgesia was achieved only at a higher dose. =Crustaceans= Evidence of the capacity for invertebrates to experience nociception and pain has been widely studied in crustaceans. In the crab Neohelice granulata, electric shocks delivered via small holes in the carapace elicited a defensive threat display. Injection of morphine reduced the crabs' sensitivity to the shock in a dose-dependent manner, with the effect declining with increasing duration between morphine injection and shock. Naloxone injection inhibited the effects of morphine, as is seen in vertebrates. Morphine also had inhibitory effects on the escape tail-flick response to electric shock in the mantis shrimp, Squilla mantis, that was reversed by naloxone, indicating that the effect is found in crustacean groups other than decapods. When the irritants acetic acid or sodium hydroxide were applied to the antennae of grass prawns, Penaeus monodon, there was an increase in rubbing and grooming of the treated areas which was not seen if they had previously been treated with a local anaesthetic, benzocaine, however, the benzocaine did not eliminate the level of rubbing seen in response to mechanical stimulation with forceps. There was no effect of benzocaine on the general locomotion of the prawns, so the reduction in rubbing and grooming was not simply due to inactivity of the animal. Another local anaesthetic, xylocaine, reduced the stress of eyestalk ablation in female whiteleg shrimps, Litopenaeus vannamei, as indicated by levels of feeding and swimming. It has not always been possible to replicate these findings in crustaceans. In one study, three decapod crustacean species, Louisiana red swamp crayfish, white shrimp and grass shrimp, were tested for nociceptive behaviour by applying sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, or benzocaine to the antennae. This caused no change in behaviour in these three species compared to controls. Animals did not groom the treated antenna, and there was no difference in movement of treated individuals and controls. Extracellular recordings of antennal nerves in the Louisiana red swamp crayfish revealed continual spontaneous activity, but no neurons that were reliably excited by the application of sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. The authors concluded there was no behavioural or physiological evidence that the antennae contained specialized nociceptors that responded to pH. It could be argued that differences in the findings between studies may be due to responses to extreme pH being inconsistently evoked across species. It has been argued that the analgesic effects of morphine should not be used as a criterion of the ability of animals, at least crustaceans, to experience pain. In one study, shore crabs, Carcinus maenas received electric shocks in a preferred dark shelter but not if they remained in an unpreferred light area. Analgesia from morphine should have enhanced movement to the preferred dark area because the crabs would not have experienced 'pain' from the electric shock. However, morphine inhibited rather than enhanced this movement, even when no shock was given. Morphine produced a general effect of non- responsiveness rather than a specific analgesic effect, which could also explain previous studies claiming analgesia. However, the researchers argued that other systems such as the enkephalin or steroid systems might be used in pain modulation by crustaceans and that behavioural responses should be considered rather than specific physiological and morphological features. =Insects= The house cricket, Acheta domestica Morphine extends the period that crickets remain on the heated surface of a hotplate.  Trade-offs between stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements  This is a particularly important criterion for assessing whether an animal has the capacity to experience pain rather than only nociception. Nociceptive responses do not require consciousness or higher neural processing; this results in relatively fixed, reflexive actions. However, the experience of pain does involve higher neural centres which also take into account other factors of relevance to the animal, i.e. competing motivations. This means that a response to the experience of pain is likely to be more plastic than a nociceptive response when there are competing factors for the animal to consider. Hermit crabs fighting over a shell Robert Elwood and Mirjam Appel at the Queen's University of Belfast argue that pain may be inferred when the responses to a noxious stimulus are not reflexive but are traded off against other motivational requirements, the experience is remembered and the situation is avoided in the future. They investigated this by giving hermit crabs small electric shocks within their shells. Only crabs given shocks evacuated their shells indicating the aversive nature of the stimulus, but fewer crabs evacuated from a preferred species of shell demonstrating a motivational trade-off. Most crabs, however, did not evacuate at the shock level used, but when these shocked crabs were subsequently offered a new shell, they were more likely to approach and enter the new shell. They approached the new shell more quickly, investigated it for a shorter time and used fewer cheliped probes within the aperture prior to moving in. This demonstrates the experience of the electric shock altered future behaviour in a manner consistent with a marked shift in motivation to get a new shell to replace the one previously occupied. Learned avoidance Learning to avoid a noxious stimulus indicates that prior experience of the stimulus is remembered by the animal and appropriate action taken in the future to avoid or reduce potential damage. This type of response is therefore not the fixed, reflexive action of nociceptive avoidance. = Habituation and sensitization = Habituation and sensitisation are two simple, but widespread, forms of learning. Habituation refers to a type of non-associative learning in which repeated exposure to a stimulus leads to decreased responding. Sensitization is another form of learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a stimulus. When a tactile stimulus is applied to the skin of Aplysia californica, the animal withdraws the siphon and gill between the parapodia. This defensive withdrawal, known as the Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex, has been the subject of much study on learning behaviour. Generally, these studies have involved only weak, tactile stimulation and are therefore more relevant to the question of whether invertebrates can experience nociception, however, some studies have used electric shocks to examine this response (See sections on \\"Electrical stimulation\\" and \\"Operant conditioning\\"). =Location avoidance= Avoidance learning was examined in the crab Neohelice granulata by placing the animals in a dark compartment of a double-chamber device and allowing them to move towards a light compartment. Experimental crabs received a shock in the light compartment, whilst controls did not. After 1 min, both experimental and control crabs were free to return to the dark compartment. The learned outcome was not a faster escape response to the stimulus but rather refraining from re-entering the light compartment. A single trial was enough to establish an association between light and shock that was detected up to 3 hours later. Studies on crayfish, Procambarus clarkia, demonstrated that they learned to associate the turning on of a light with a shock that was given 10 seconds later. They learned to respond by walking to a safe area in which the shock was not delivered. However, this only occurred if the crayfish were facing the area to which they could retreat to avoid the shock. If they were facing away from the safe area the animal did not walk but responded to the shock by a tail-flick escape response. Despite repeated pairings of light and shock the animals did not learn to avoid the shock by tail-flicking in response to light. Curiously, when the animals that had experienced shocks whilst facing away from the safe area were subsequently tested facing towards the safe area they showed a very rapid avoidance of the shock upon the onset of the light. Thus, they seemed to have learned the association although they had not previously used it to avoid the shock - much like mammalian latent learning. These studies show an ability in decapods that fulfils several criteria for pain experience rather than nociception. =Conditioned suppression= A drone bee Honeybees extend their proboscis when learning about novel odours. In one study on this response, bees learnt to discriminate between two odours, but then learned to suppress the proboscis extension response when one of the odours was paired with an electric shock. This indicates the sensation was aversive to the bee, however, the response was plastic rather than simply reflexive, indicating pain rather than nociception. =Operant conditioning= Operant studies using vertebrates have been conducted for many years. In such studies, an animal operates or changes some part of the environment to gain a positive reinforcement or avoid a negative one. In this way, animals learn from the consequence of their own actions, i.e. they use an internal predictor. Operant responses indicate a voluntary act; the animal exerts control over the frequency or intensity of its responses, making these distinct from reflexes and complex fixed action patterns. A number of studies have revealed surprising similarities between vertebrates and invertebrates in their capacity to use operant responses to gain positive reinforcements, but also to avoid negative reinforcement that in vertebrates would be described as 'pain'. Underside of a snail climbing a blade of grass, showing the muscular foot Snail It has been shown that snails will operate a manipulandum to electrically self-stimulate areas of their brain. Balaban and Maksimova surgically implanted fine wire electrodes in two regions of the brains of snails (Helix sp.). To receive electrical stimulation of the brain, the snail was required to displace the end of a rod. When pressing the rod delivered self-stimulation to the mesocerebrum (which is involved in sexual activity) the snails increased the frequency of operating the manipulandum compared to the baseline spontaneous frequency of operation. However, when stimulation was delivered to the parietal ganglion, the snails decreased the frequency of touching the rod compared to the baseline spontaneous frequency. These increases and decreases in pressing are positive and negative reinforcement responses typical of those seen with vertebrates. Aplysia To examine the gill and siphon withdrawal response to a putatively painful stimulus, Aplysia were tested in pairs. During the initial training period, the experimental animal received a siphon shock each time its gill relaxed below a criterion level, and the yoked control animal received a shock whenever the experimental animal did, regardless of its own gill position. The experimental animals spent more time with their gills contracted above the criterion level than did the control animals during each period, demonstrating operant conditioning. Drosophila melanogaster Drosophila A fly-controlled heat-box has been designed to study operant conditioning in several studies of Drosophila. Each time a fly walks into the designated half of the tiny dark chamber, the whole space is heated. As soon as the animal leaves the punished half, the chamber temperature reverts to normal. After a few minutes, the animals restrict their movements to one-half of the chamber, even if the heat is switched off. A Drosophila flight simulator has been used to examine operant conditioning. The flies are tethered in an apparatus that measures the yaw torque of their flight attempts and stabilizes movements of the panorama. The apparatus controls the fly's orientation based on these attempts. When the apparatus was set up to direct a heat beam on the fly if it \\"flew\\" to certain areas of its panorama, the flies learned to prefer and avoid certain flight orientations in relation to the surrounding panorama. The flies \\"avoided\\" areas that caused them to receive heat. These experiments show that Drosophila can use operant behaviour and learn to avoid noxious stimuli. However, these responses were plastic, complex behaviours rather than simple reflex actions, consistent more with the experience of pain rather than simply nociception. Cognitive abilities Atta colombica workers transporting leaves It could be argued that a high cognitive ability is not necessary for the experience of pain, otherwise, it could be argued that humans with less cognitive capacity have a lower likelihood of experiencing pain. However, most definitions of pain indicate some degree of cognitive ability. Several of the learned and operant behaviours described above indicate that invertebrates have high cognitive abilities. Other examples include: *Social transmission of information during the waggle dance of honeybees. *Idiothetic orientation by spiders, i.e. they memorize information about their previous movements. *Detour behaviour in which spiders choose to take an indirect route to a goal rather than the most direct route, thereby indicating flexibility in behaviour and route planning, and possibly insight learning. *Conceptualisation in the honeybee, Apis mellifera. *Problem solving in leafcutter ants, Atta colombica. *Numeracy in the yellow mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, and honeybee. =Non-stereotyped behavior= Charles Darwin was interested in worms and \\"how far they acted consciously, and how much mental power they displayed.\\" In The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, Darwin described complex behaviors by worms when plugging their burrows. He suggested that worms appear to \\"have the power of acquiring some notion, however crude, of the shape of an object and of their burrows\\" and if so, \\"they deserve to be called intelligent; for they then act in nearly the same manner as would a man under similar circumstances.\\" Donald Griffin's 1984 Animal Thinking defends the idea that invertebrate behavior is complex, intelligent, and somewhat general. He points to examples in W. S. Bristowe's 1976 The World of Spiders detailing how spiders respond adaptively to novel conditions. For instance, a spider can eat a fly held in front of it by an experimenter, bypassing the usual step of moving toward an insect caught on its web. A spider may adapt the shape of its web to abnormal circumstances, suggesting that the web is not just built with a fixed template. Griffin also considers leaf-cutter ants, with central nervous systems \\"less than a millimeter in diameter,\\" and asks: \\"Can the genetic instructions stored in such a diminutive central nervous system prescribe all of the detailed motor actions carried out by one of these ants? Or is it more plausible to suppose that their DNA programs the development of simple generalizations [...]?\\" In other instances invertebrates display more \\"dumb,\\" pre-programmed behavior. Darwin himself cites examples involving ants, sphexes, and bees. Dean Wooldridge described how a sphex wasp brings a paralyzed cricket to its burrow and then goes inside to inspect the burrow before coming back out and bringing the cricket in. If the cricket is moved slightly while the wasp is away making its first inspection, the wasp upon returning from the burrow reorients the cricket to its proper position and then proceeds to check the burrow again, even though it was already checked just before. If the cricket is moved again, the routine repeats once more. This process has been repeated up to 40 times in a row. Based on this example, Douglas Hofstadter coined the term \\"sphexish\\" to mean deterministic or pre-programmed. =Social interaction= Social behavior is widespread in invertebrates, including cockroaches, termites, aphids, thrips, ants, bees, Passalidae, Acari, spiders, and more. Social interaction is particularly salient in eusocial species but applies to other invertebrates as well. Jeffrey A. Lockwood, citing previous authors, argues that awareness of how other minds operate may be an important requirement for social interaction. Social behavior indicates that insects can recognize information conveyed by other insects, and this suggests they may also have some self-awareness. Lockwood asserts: \\"it is rather implausible to contend that through sensory mechanisms an insect is aware of the environment, other insects, and the needs of conspecifics but through some neural blockage, the same insect is selectively unconscious of sensory input about itself.\\" Protective legislation In the UK from 1993 to 2012, the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) was the only invertebrate protected under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. In 2012, this legislation was extended to include all cephalopods in accordance with a general EU directive which states \\"...there is scientific evidence of their [cephalopods] ability to experience pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm.

He was a center in college for St. Bonaventure University in the 1960s, and averaged over 23 points a game before suffering a knee injury. After college, he played as a power forward in the EuroLeague. There, he won two championships with Real Madrid. He also won the FIBA Saporta Cup with Partenope Napoli. Aiken coached the British Olympic basketball team in the 1970s, and later became a sportscaster of basketball and American football. Early life Aiken was born in New York City. He grew up in the neighborhood of Harlem in the New York City borough of Manhattan, playing basketball in its playgrounds. College career Aiken attended St. Bonaventure University in New York State, and played center for their basketball team. He averaged more than 20 points a game on the school's freshman squad in 1960‚Äì61. As a sophomore, he started for the Bonnies, and averaged 23.6 points and 11.0 rebounds per game. By December 1961, he was rated one of the outstanding prospects in the United States. On December 16, 1961, he broke Elgin Baylor's Bluegrass invitational basketball tournament record by scoring 58 points in two games. On February 13, 1962, he was named to the weekly major college All-East Basketball Team by the Eastern College Athletic Conference. Aiken averaged 23 points per game in his first two years of varsity play. In early 1963, after averaging 23 points per game and 14 rebounds per game in 10 games, he injured his left knee in a game against Duquesne University. He underwent surgery, and was sidelined for a good portion of the year. Professional career When he was not drafted in the 1964 NBA draft, Aiken went to Europe to play basketball. He used a brace on his injured knee. Aiken played for √Åguilas Escolapios Schuss de Bilbao (Spain) in 1965‚Äì66, and was the top scorer in the Primera Divisi√≥n. He also played for the Newcastle Eagles in 1965‚Äì66 under Spanish coach Antonio Diaz Miguel, and led the National League in scoring with 23.9 points per game. He then played for Real Madrid in the late 1960s, leading them to two consecutive EuroLeague titles in 1967 and 1968. In 1967, he led his team with 31 points in its semifinal win over Olimpija, 88‚Äì86, and he had 23 points in the EuroLeague Final to help Real Madrid beat Simmenthal Milano. In 1968, in the title game he led all scorers with 26 points to lead Real Madrid to the title against Spartak Brno, 98‚Äì95. In the 1969 European Cup final CSKA Moscow beat Real Madrid in double overtime, as he led Madrid with 24 points. He joined Partenope Napoli that summer and led it to the 1970 Saporta Cup title, over JDA Dijon Basket. Jet magazine noted that he was one of four blacks in the European finals, along with Rudy Bennett (New York University), Larry Robertson (Oklahoma University), and Jim Williams (Temple University). Concurrently with playing for the team, he coached, and earned a long-distance teaching degree at the University of Southern California. He worked in England as a teacher after completing his studies. On February 3, 2008, Aiken was among 105 players nominated for the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors list. Career after basketball In October 1975, he became Britain's Olympic basketball team coach. He coached the British Olympic team in 1976. Aiken later moved into business and sports commentating. In 1982, he began hosting broadcasts of British basketball games on British television. The Boston Globe wrote in 1984 that he \\"has probably done more than anyone to stimulate interest for basketball in Britain, just by force of his personality.\\" He covered American football with Nicky Horne in the 1980s. In 1983, he covered the Super Bowl for Britain's independent Channel Four, London, with the broadcast attracting two million British viewers. =Writing= Aiken co- authored the Channel 4 Basketball Guide with Philip Linton (Statmill, 1983). He also co-authored American Football: The Records with Peter Rowe (Guinness Books, 1989), which covers the history of football, the development of high school and college football and the National Football League, and football in Canada and Europe.

The assaults have similarities to the happy slapping trend seen in Europe, in which camera phones are used to record assaults. Other names given to assaults of this type include \\"knockout\\", \\"knockout king\\", \\"point 'em out, knock 'em out\\", and \\"polar-bearing\\" or \\"polar-bear hunting\\" (allegedly called such when the victim is white and the assailants are not). Serious injuries and even deaths have been attributed to the knockout game. Some news sources report that there was an escalation of such attacks in late 2013, and, in some cases, the attacker was charged with a hate crime. History of attacks =1992‚Äì2009= In September 1992, Norwegian exchange student Yngve Raustein was killed by three teenagers who‚Äîaccording to Cambridge, Massachusetts, prosecutors‚Äîwere playing a game called \\"knockout.\\" Local teens said that the object is to render an unsuspecting target unconscious with a single punch, and, if the assailant does not succeed, his companions will turn on him instead. In 2005 in the United Kingdom, BBC News reported on the happy slapping incidents, in which the attacks were filmed for the purpose of posting online. The French government responded to this trend by making it illegal to film any acts of violence and post them online, with a spokesperson for then President Nicolas Sarkozy saying that the law was indeed directed at \\"happy slapping.\\" Three teens were arrested in Decatur, Illinois, in September 2009, and charged in the killing of a bicyclist, 61, who was stomped to death, and the attempted murder of another man, 46, who was also attacked and stomped. It was claimed that the teens were playing \\"point 'em out, knock 'em out,\\" where a person is selected and a group of attackers attempts to render the victim unconscious. In June 2009, a 29-year-old man was beaten in a Columbia, Missouri, parking garage by a group of teens who told police that they were playing a game called \\"knockout king,\\" where they would find an unsuspecting person and attempt to knock him out with a single punch. =2011‚Äì2013= In April 2011, Hoang Nguyen, 72, died in St. Louis, Missouri, after he was attacked in what was described by a local CBS station as \\"part of the so-called knockout game\\". Nguyen's wife, Yen, 62, was injured. After the trial, the assailant, Elex Murphy, a black teenager who was 18 at the time of the assault, was sentenced to life in prison plus 25 years. In July 2012, 62-year-old Delfino Mora was attacked by three men and killed in West Rogers Park, Chicago. Anthony Malcolm, 20, who recorded the attack on his cell phone and publicized it, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Nicholas Ayala, 18, was sentenced to 27 years.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-2014-02-05-chi-2nd-teen-charged-in-2012-knockout-game-killing- gets-30-years-20140204-story.html The third, Malik Jones, 21, was sentenced to 33 years.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-33-years-for- facebook-killing-20170130-story.html The attack was said to be part of a game called \\"pick 'em out, knock 'em out.\\" In 2013, a series of these attacks resulted in the deaths of the victims, all with some sort of game as a precipitating factor. Michael Daniels, 51, of Syracuse, New York died a day after being attacked in May 2013, with the \\"knockout game\\" later mentioned in regard to his death. Ralph Santiago, a disabled homeless resident of Hoboken, New Jersey, was found dead after being attacked by three boys whose assault was linked to the \\"knockout\\" game. Yale Daily News reported seven attacks during November 2013 in New Haven, Connecticut that could be associated with the knockout game. Yale University's chief of police wrote an email to the campus community pertaining to the issue on November 21. In the United States, The New York Times noted \\"a growing log of reports of such crimes in the Northeast and beyond\\". A number of news stories in late November 2013 covered incidents in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where a series of attacks took place during October and November of that year. As a result, the NYPD responded by stepping up patrols in certain neighborhoods. On November 24, 2013, in Katy, Texas, an 81-year-old black man was attacked and hospitalized. Two weeks later, Conrad Alvin Barrett, 29, was arrested after allegedly showing an off- duty police officer a video he recorded with his cell phone of himself perpetrating the attack and explicitly referencing \\"knockout\\". Investigators revealed that there were other videos on his phone in which he used racial epithets and another in which he wondered if he would receive media attention if he were to commit a \\"knockout game\\" attack on a black man. This was one of the first cases in which the victim was black. Previous instances in the US primarily involved white or Asian victims and black assailants. The Justice Department subsequently charged Barrett with a hate crime, the only time the DOJ involved itself in prosecuting these attacks. Barrett's attorney claimed his client suffers from bipolar disorder and was not on medication at the time of the attack. In October 2015, Barrett was sentenced to 71 months (5 years and 11 months) in federal incarceration. He still faces charges in state court. =2013‚Äì2020= On July 27, 2016 in Milan, Italian police arrested a young Spaniard on vacation in Italy, after he made repeated assaults on passersby, similar to this \\"game\\". On that same date, in Greenville, South Carolina a man was attacked while playing Pokemon GO. In December 2015, a Hispanic man in New Jersey was reported assaulted by a Hispanic teen playing the \\"knockout game\\". The perpetrator turned himself in two months later and was ultimately sentenced to three years incarceration. On August 29, 2016, a 30-year-old Guatemalan, Mardoquo Sincal Jochola, was fatally assaulted in Philadelphia and is alleged to have been a victim of the \\"knockout game\\". On July 31, 2017, an unidentified man was caught on camera while knocking out a 24-year-old woman, Yana Rozanova, in Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv Oblast, Ukraine. On October 1, 2020, alongside Central Park West, an unidentified black man was caught on surveillance video assaulting actor Rick Moranis with a single blow to the head. Racial components =Antisemitism= Several attacks on Jewish victims in Brooklyn in 2013 have been called antisemitic hate crimes. ABC Nightline reported that New York City police believed that antisemitism was likely to be a motive in the attacks, as all eight victims were identified as Jewish. Jewish community leaders in Brooklyn have spoken out on the subject, and the Anti-Defamation League regional office issued a public statement on knockout attacks \\"targeting Jewish individuals in Brooklyn\\". Amrit Marajh, a 28-year-old suspect in an attack that took place in Brooklyn, was charged with a hate crime as his victim was Jewish. Marajh has claimed innocence and denied the claims of antisemitism. On December 3, newly elected black Democratic New York City councilwoman Laurie Cumbo added a letter to her Facebook page saying: \\"The accomplishments of the Jewish community triggers feelings of resentment, and a sense that Jewish success is not also their success.\\" The Anti-Defamation League said her post was \\"troubling\\" and that it evoked \\"classic anti-Semitic stereotypes.\\" Cumbo later issued an apology for the remarks. Cumbo added that the lives of victims and suspects will never be the same and that attackers would be \\"prosecuted to the full extent of the law\\". NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly later stated that he was avoiding referring to the attacks as part of any sort of trend to avoid further copycat attacks and has instead been labeling them as hate crimes. Response =Government action= =New York= On November 21, 2013 Republican New York State assemblyman Jim Tedisco put forward legislation called the \\"Knockout Assault Deterrent Act\\" to charge juvenile offenders in these type of attacks as adults, and would also punish those who were found recording the attacks. New York State Senator Hugh Farley (also a Republican) supports legislation that would make assailants linked to the knockout game liable to harsher sentences, would try juvenile offenders as adults, and would make accomplices criminally responsible. Democratic assemblyman John McDonald, while admitting stiffer penalties were warranted claimed Tedisco's bill was unnecessary. =Wisconsin= In Wisconsin, Republican State Assemblyman Dean Kaufert said he was considering drafting a bill to deter attacks. =Communities= After incidents during late 2013 in Brooklyn in which Jews were victims of knockout attacks, Jewish leaders, councilmembers, and organization representatives spoke against the attacks. Leaders from the black community also made statements. New York City councilman Charles Barron stated that the root of the problem was a need for jobs to keep young people out of trouble; he also suggested additional funding for community patrols to act as lookouts. Representative Hakeem Jeffries said at a Crown Heights Youth Collective conference that attacks based on race will not be tolerated and that the collective will do everything in its power to see that justice is done. Brooklyn's then-District Attorney-elect Kenneth P. Thompson called out the attacks, saying that \\"there is no status to be gained\\" for knocking out an unsuspecting victim and that such violence will not be tolerated. Brooklyn Borough President-elect Eric Adams affirmed Thompson's statement, saying that, if you \\"play this game, ... you will lose\\". Other notable New York City community members who have spoken against the attacks include Reverend Al Sharpton, Dov Hikind, Russell Simmons, Foundation for Ethnic Understanding founder Rabbi Marc Schneier, former NYC mayor David Dinkins and former New Orleans mayor and current National Urban League president Marc Morial released a video in December 2013 saying \\"No to K.O.\\" Retired Brooklyn-born boxer Mike Tyson has also spoken against the attacks on The Piers Morgan Show. Criticism of reporting The existence of a growing trend of knockout attacks has been questioned; claims about the prevalence of the phenomenon have been called an \\"urban myth\\" and a \\"type of panic\\" by some political analysts. A June 2011 investigative report by John Tucker of the Riverfront Times following the death of Hoang Nguyen in 2011 saw many related attacks, all attributed to the \\"Knockout King\\" game. St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Chief Daniel Isom stated that a year prior the police determined that the knockout game was played by a group of children who went around trying to knock random people unconscious. The police estimated the activity was not widespread and limited to five or nine teens. In Tucker's interviews with local teens, they believed the number to be much higher; one 18-year-old estimated 10-15% of his peers played the game. A St. Louis area barber said that in his youth the phenomenon was not called \\"Knockout King\\" but \\"One Hitter Quitter\\". Mike Males of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice claimed that the media has been cherry-picking related attacks for sensationalism, asserting that \\"This knockout-game legend is a fake trend.\\" Police at the time believed such attacks might have been under-reported by immigrant victims in communities where relations with law enforcement had been tense. An attack from 2012 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was tentatively linked to more recent attacks, although it was never identified as part of any \\"game\\". Police in Syracuse, New York, reported that one assailant in a fatal attack admitted to its being \\"knockout\\", with a police sergeant noting that the assaults he was investigating were definitely \\"for a game\\" rather than being attempted murders or robberies. On November 23, 2013, The New York Times reported that police officials in New York City were considering their position on the \\"game\\" and were wondering if they should advise the public, but had to contend with the uncertain existence of the game. Police in New York City questioned whether they were faced with a trend or a series of isolated incidents. Then-New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly refused to refer to the attacks in Brooklyn as the \\"knockout game\\" to avoid possible copycat attacks. Several assaults associated with the knockout game do not follow any particular pattern; in several instances, a single assailant attempted a one-punch attack while in others multiple assailants participated in a gang attack. The \\"Knockout King\\" death of Nguyen in St. Louis was such a gang attack. A purported trend was identified in Lansing, Michigan called \\"point 'em out, knock 'em out\\" involved the use of a Taser. Many officials have outright refused to refer to the assaults as a \\"game\\", with Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter explicitly stating he did not want to give the idea any credibility while at a press conference after an attack at a Philadelphia pizzeria where the suspects never mentioned the game. In a CNN interview with Don Lemon, Nutter stated he was not sure if the knockout game is real or not, adding he less concerned about the name but saying the incidents are of \\"great concern\\" and could spark copycat behavior. Nutter would not answer if the attacks were racially motivated and stated that Philadelphia has no confirmed \\"game\\" incidents. Earlier, Philadelphia Police spokeswoman Tanya Little determined a November 11 attack as part of a knockout game. Jamelle Bouie of The Daily Beast was critical of the game's existence as a trend, comparing its existence to the \\"wilding\\" assault allegedly at hand in the Central Park jogger case and the often reported headlight flashing urban legend. Although several people were attacked and one had died, Bouie pointed out that the attacks were not really rare, noting the FBI had reported 127,577 unarmed assaults in 2012. When Singal approached several local news stations, a representative from an NBC affiliate responded saying that the footage had been taken from a shared pool of stock footage that other NBC stations in the area were given, and generally, if the footage is found to be inaccurate there would be a digital note concerning it. The note was absent in the case of the London video for reasons unknown. Singal's investigation led him to believe that people around the country are being told a story that has not been properly researched. Chris Hayes, host of MSNBC's All In with Chris Hayes, gave the knockout game his first annual \\"Over-Covered Stories of the Year\\" award, due to what he perceived as excessive coverage by Fox News. Robin Abcarian for the Los Angeles Times criticized this reporting style by a conservative analyst, saying that blame was shifted onto the federal government. Abcarian noted that Barrett explicitly stated he was seeking a black victim, and postulated that he may have been acting on this \\"lazy narrative that black teens were randomly attacking white people\\". She criticized the statement by Rev. Sharpton and the conservative news sources who began supporting him after decades of opposition. Tommy Christopher, writing for Mediaite, claimed James Rosen's report for Fox News on the attack was misleading, noting claims made by Rosen that it is the first such attack to be charged as a hate crime, when it was the first under federal statute. Christopher cited the arrest of Amrit Marajh in Brooklyn and the investigation of the alleged assault on Taj Patterson, a gay black man who claimed he was attacked by a group of Orthodox Jewish men, as proof of this. Abcarian criticized the reporting of this attack as possibly being related to the knockout game trend, as the alleged attackers sought out Patterson because he was gay rather than because he is black. She also brought up a case of a fabrication of a \\"knockout\\"-style attack, after the victim and her boyfriend revealed she had lied that she was attacked at random by a stranger and instead he had struck her, noting that the St. Louis Post-Dispatch did not report the initial attack as a \\"knockout game\\" attack. Abcarian claimed that the 2011 attack by Dajour Washington on James Addlesburger was being used for sensationalism. The video of the assault was shown by Bill O'Reilly, which Addlesburger felt was being exploited and manipulated to fan racial hatred. Washington, who spent nine months in juvenile detention for the attack, appeared on Nightline in 2013 and claimed he had not attacked Addlesburger because he was white but rather because he was the only man present. Washington also claimed that at the time of the attack he had never heard of the \\"knockout game\\".

He died, aged 80, on 18 November 1851, at 40 Brunswick Street, Haggerston; he was survived by Eliza Herbert, probably his daughter. Works With Edward Wedlake Brayley he produced in 1803 a volume of tales and poems, entitled Syr Reginalde, or the Black Tower; a romance of the Twelfth Century (London), and in 1806 a history of Lambeth Palace, which he dates from Globe Place, Lambeth. Another edition of the latter work was published for the illustrators in the same year. He was also associated with Robert Wilkinson in producing Londina Illustrata, an illustrated account of ancient buildings in London and Westminster in two volumes (1819‚Äì25). According to the plates of this work he lived at Marsh Gate, Lambeth, in 1808‚Äì9. Herbert is best known for his History of the Twelve great Livery Companies of London, (1836‚Äì7, 2 vols).

Optomux is an ASCII protocol consisting of command messages and response messages containing data from an Optomux unit & contain a message checksum to ensure secure communications. The serial data link is very reliable, over distances up to 4,000 feet and is suitable for extreme safety applications. An Optomux system is typically made up of three main elements: * There must be a host device to poll the Optomux brain boards. * There are the brain boards themselves, anywhere from one to 255 of them. * Each Optomux brain board attaches to an I/O mounting rack, carrying the individual I/O modules. Limitation The primary performance limitation of the Optomux system is the slow serial data link. The maximum data rate supported by the Optomux brain boards is 38.4 kbit/s (also dependent on the length of the communication lines). In theory, at maximum speed, the Optomux system should be capable of polling roughly 3,400 digital positions per second, or roughly 600 analog positions per second. This is assuming that all the positions are on the same brain board, which is not possible with Optomux. A more realistic speed figure would be about half of the previous numbers.

In the Middle Ages the rock was used in the 15th century as a watchtower (Burgwarte), similar to that on the other side of the Elbe, Neurathen Castle. To that end the rock crevice below the summit plateau was widened into an artificial cave, used as a guardhouse. On the eastern side there are more traces of hammers. In addition, an artificial, earth embankment, about 35 m long, was built. Archaeological investigations ins 1963 brought to light pieces of ceramic, the spindle whorl of a spindle, the site of a hearth and fragments of charcoal.

By playing a specific group of songs aimed specifically at the young African American demographic, \\"Black Appeal Stations\\" helped keep radio alive. Many other radio stations soon began to employ the \\"Top 40\\" radio format, in which the vast majority found their stations to rise from the bottom to top of ratings in their markets. By employing \\"Top 40\\" as a radio format, stations were also making a decision to target a niche in the listening audience rather than trying to appeal to everyone as they had done since the beginning. Thus, several different stations could engage in format radio that included songs that appealed to various niche audiences within a community. This strategy of marketing radio broadcasting was made clear and successful through the developments and maturation of early \\"Black Appeal Stations.\\"  History  As 1952 drew to a close, the world of broadcasting was a maelstrom of probes, experiments, deals, and adjustments. Everything was in flux due to losing audience and programs to television. In Chicago, Jack Cooper, a black DJ with a big band audience refused to play R & B as it was considered 'low life' and had 'suggestive lyrics' that were somewhat sexual due to the double entendre's, the cultural connotations were that it was music your mother didn't let you listen to. The music of black appeal stations gained a popular and mostly black audience in 'juke' joints, jukeboxes, and record stores. Barlow, William (1999) Voice Over: The Making of Black Radio- Philadelphia:Temple Univ press , pg100 Radio, sensing disaster, looked for new functions.

WDIA Memphis claims to be the first black format radio station. Blues great B.B. King started his career as a disk jockey on the station programmed by Nat D. Williams with a rhythm and blues sound. But the station also featured discussion of race issues as experienced and viewed by black announcers.Hilmes, M. (1997). Radio Voices: American Broadcasting, 1922-1952. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, p. 272-3. The format was successful, and quickly spread to other stations in Birmingham, New Orleans, Nashville, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Washington D.C., among others. In 1949 only four stations aired a black appeal format. By 1952 there were around 200 such stations and by 1956 there were 400.Hilmes, M. (1997). Radio Voices: American Broadcasting, 1922-1952. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, p. 273. Some people thought radio should become the medium of intellectuals. One-time radio greats like Eddie Cantor and Paul Whiteman were disk-jockeys. Taboos had vanished; now at this time almost anything could be discussed on radio. But ratings still plunged, and major sponsors were ready and eager for the switch. As the comedian Fred Allen put it, \\"they were ready to abandon radio like the bones at a barbeque.\\" The nation began to flock to television. Bishop Fulton J. Sheen was placed into a weekly series against Milton Berle and his Texaco program. Information Please began to transition itself from radio into the realm of television. Another radio veteran, Walter Winchell, wearing his hat like a 1930's movie reporter, transitioned from radio as well and shouted out news insights with a gravelly voice. Edward R. Murrow and a young collaborator, Fred W. Friendly, had transformed their documentary radio series Hear It Now into See It Now. As the audience for comedy, variety, and drama shifted toward television and away from radio, radio stations had to find a new way to attract an audience. Stations that had remained independent had been familiar with the answer for several years. That answer was found in the newly permitted freedom to play recorded music. In the mid-1940s technology for the recording industry had advanced to the point that recorded music was equal to or better than live performances on radio. Therefore, radio stations were airing fewer and fewer live performers through the decade with more airtime being devoted to records. Network affiliates had to fill more and more airtime on their own, and they too began to turn to recorded music. In the 1950s these new sounds from the recording industry began to find prominent airtime on the radio. This influence was in large part to Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed, who developed a new term for the upbeat music that combined elements for rhythm and blues, gospel, and country. He called it Rock and Roll. This popular new music through the tremendous aid of \\"Negro Stations\\" or \\"Black Appeal Stations\\" soon was being played on numerous jukeboxes in young adult and teen hangouts. =See Also= *WLAC *WERD *WEDR *WDIA *Arthur Bernard Leaner *Jack Gibson *Daddy-O Daylie *DJ Nat D. *Glossary of jive talk *Jive talk =External links= *Archives_of_African_American_Music_and_Culture  References  Jazz radio presenters ","title":"Black-appeal stations"},{"id":"31566137","text":"The Brique da Reden√ß√£o is a traditional fair held every Sunday.

Located along Meridian Street on the southern side of the city, Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs it was started in 1870 and completed in 1872. History The house was built as the home of George Stumpf, a native of Bavaria who moved to Indiana with his family in 1838. A craftsman, Stumpf was both a blacksmith and a manufacturer of wagons for much of his working life. As he grew older, his eyes became damaged by the strain of smithing, so he and his wife Elizabeth purchased property on South Meridian Street in northern Perry Township, which was then known as Three Notch Road. Here they built a log cabin and began farming; as they prospered, they prepared to erect a brick house, but construction was delayed nearly ten years by the American Civil War. Stumpf and his wife were active in local society: they were members of Zion Evangelical Protestant Church in Indianapolis, and they participated in the establishment of the General German Protestant Orphans Home. They were the parents of eight children; after the deaths of their parents, the land was divided among all the children, with the house passing into the possession of George Stumpf II. He departed from his father's career, embarking in the manufacturing of sausages; after his death, the house was owned by three successive generations of his descendants. Architecture The Stumpf House is a symmetrical two-story brick structure with a foundation of fieldstone; except for a small addition to the rear that consists of a porch and kitchen, it is rectangular in layout. Inside, the two floors have similar plans: a center hallway with a stairway is surrounded by four rooms of equal sizes. An attic sits above the upper story. In its early years, the house was one of two buildings on the property: a small summer house was erected behind the main residence for the use of the farm's employees. George Stumpf chose an elaborate form of the Italianate style of architecture for his home. Aside from the increased height needed by its unusually high attic, the house is a textbook example of the style: it features wide eaves with large wooden brackets, a hip roof, corbelling below the attic, and rounded arch windows. Measuring five bays wide, the facade includes shorter attic windows, a recessed entrance with a heavy wooden front door, and two large chimneys. Virtually none of the house has seen significant modifications, except for the small addition on the rear: this has seen the replacement of its original gable window, the addition of casement and aluminum storm windows to the kitchen, and the enclosure of the porch. Although the house's interior deteriorated over the twentieth century, it remained one of the area's best Italianate structures. It includes many design features common to large Italianate houses in Indiana, such as the symmetrical floor plan with a five- bay facade.Peat, Wilbur. Indiana Houses of the Nineteenth Century. Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Society, 1962, 124-125. Recognition In 1979, the Stumpf House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. It is one of five National Register-listed locations in Perry Township, along with the main administration building of the University of Indianapolis, the Hanna-Ochler- Elder House, the Homecroft Historic District, and the Old Southport High School.

The method is to extend the Condorcet method by swapping candidates until a Condorcet winner is found. The winner is the candidate which requires the minimum number of swaps. Dodgson proposed this voting scheme in his 1876 work \\"A method of taking votes on more than two issues\\". Given an integer k and an election, it is NP- complete to determine whether a candidate can become a Condorcet winner with fewer than k swaps. Description In Dodgson's method, each voter submits an ordered list of all candidates according to their own preference (from best to worst). The winner is defined to be the candidate for whom we need to perform the minimum number of pairwise swaps in each ballot (added over all candidates) before they become a Condorcet winner. In particular, if there is already a Condorcet winner, they win the election. In short, we must find the voting profile with minimum Kendall tau distance from the input, such that it has a Condorcet winner; then, the Condorcet winner is declared the victor. Computing the winner or even the Dodgson score of a candidate (the number of swaps needed to make that candidate a winner) is an NP-hard problem The article only directly proves NP-hardness, but it is clear that the decision problem is in NP since given a candidate and a list of k swaps, you can tell whether that candidate is a Condorcet winner in polynomial time. by reduction from Exact Cover by 3-Sets (X3C).

Voxbone is a Belgian company specializing in wholesale telephone numbers for VoIP applications. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) allocated a portion of the non- geographic \\"country code\\" +883 to this initiative. Specifically, iNums were telephone numbers in the format +883 5100 xxxxxxxx. The system started operating in November 2008. Many providers offered iNum numbers and calls between them at no cost to their customers, but some charged for the service. Due to slow adoption, cost and compatibility issues, and the eventual lack of interest by Voxbone in maintaining the system, it was decommissioned in June 2020.What is iNum and where's it going?, Voxbone, 17 February 2020.Voxbone decommissions iNum, DSLReports, 2 June 2020.  Technical standards  The iNum networking was based on SIP standards and supported voice, video and SMS. Transcoding was available between G.711 and G.729. Video codecs supported were H.263+ and H.264, but theoretically any codec, including Skype's SILK and G.722, for high-definition voice, could be supported as long as the originating and terminating networks both supported it and transcoding was not required.  Participating organizations and access  Voxbone provided free telephone number ranges to IP communications service providers, enterprises, NGOs and universities. Approximately 400 organizations were allocated iNum ranges. Popular VoIP providers offering iNum numbers to the general public included Callcentric,iNum, Callcentric. ippi,Frequently asked questions, ippi. LocalphoneLocalphone - no more free iNums, DSLReports, 22 May 2018. and VoIP.ms.Order a DID number, VoIP.ms. While +883 is a valid ITU dial code, not all telephone carriers could route the calls correctly. Skype, Belgacom, British Telecom, Colt, Google Voice, KPN, Orange Switzerland, Sprint USA and Verizon Europe were among the large communications companies that routed voice calls to iNum. SMS to iNum was supported by several agreements with international messaging providers. It was also possible to call iNums through access numbers in many countries and cities, so callers could make local calls to iNum when their local carrier did not support routing. The caller would dial the local access number, then after the automated greeting dial the desired iNum. In addition, iNums could be called through VoIP methods such as ENUM (RIPE e164.arpa) and SIP URI (format 8835100xxxxxxxx@sip.inum.net).SIP URI, VoIP.ms. Country code +888 was allocated for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) international disaster response and implemented using the iNum platform.Working Group on Emergency Telecommuncations.  Cost  Voxbone offered free SIP termination to all service providers who offered it to their customers at or below the cost of a local call, leading many providers to offer the service at no cost. For example, Callcentric and ippi offered free iNum numbers and calls to any customer, and VoIP.ms offered them at no additional cost to existing customers. Localphone initially offered free iNum numbers, later charging $0.25 per month from July 2018, but calls were always free.Cheap calls to International (iNum), Localphone. Google Voice began supporting calls to iNum in 2012, initially at no cost, but in 2013 it set a rate of $0.03 per minute.iNum calling through Google Voice, Obitalk.  Later developments and decommissioning  After initial interest by many VoIP providers, adoption was slow.The rise of the iNum (international number), VOIPReview.org, 13 June 2012. Most providers did not support iNum calls at all, and some of those that supported such calls charged for them, undermining the value of the project. In later years the initiative began showing signs of abandonment. The iNum blog had no new posts after April 2015, and in July 2019 the whole iNum website was redirected to the Voxbone website, which no longer mentioned the project. Callcentric, one of the initial supporters, reluctantly discontinued its iNum service in November 2019 due to incompatibility after an equipment upgrade. In February 2020, Voxbone announced that it would decommission the system later that year, and the decommissioning was completed in June 2020. Calls to iNum may still connect internally within the same provider, but not between providers.

Life  Georgiana Liddell was born at 51 Portland Place, London, the youngest child of Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth (1775‚Äì1855), and his wife, Maria Susannah Simpson (c.1773‚Äì1845), who was sister-in-law to the Marquess of Normanby. She was educated at home and in December 1841 became a maid of honour to Queen Victoria She resigned that position in July 1845 and married the diplomat John Bloomfield, 2nd Baron Bloomfield, on 4 September 1845 at St Andrew's, Lamesley, the parish church of her family home. She joined her husband on his diplomatic delegations, to Hamburg and then St Petersburg shortly after her marriage, to Berlin (1851‚Äì60), and to Vienna (1861‚Äì71). There were no children of the marriage, and after her husband's death at his residence in Newport, County Tipperary, in 1879, Lady Bloomfield settled at Shrivenham, then in Berkshire, to be near her sister, Jane Elizabeth, widow of the sixth Viscount Barrington. When Lady Barrington died in 1883, Lady Bloomfield moved to Bramfield House, about two miles from Hertford. Here she exercised much hospitality and interested herself in the affairs of the village. In 1883 she published Reminiscences of Court and Diplomatic Life (2 volumes), 'a constant ripple of interesting anecdote,' as Augustus Hare described Lady Bloomfield's conversation (cf. Story of My Life, 1900, vol. vi.). She edited in 1884 a Memoir of Benjamin, Lord Bloomfield, her father-in-law, in 2 volumes. Her last work, Gleanings of a Long Life (1902), collected extracts from her favourite books. Lady Bloomfield, a 'grand dame' of an old school, kept up her friendship with Queen Victoria and her family, and delighted in social intercourse with all classes. While deeply religious on old, low church lines, she was tolerant and charitable. She founded in 1874 the Trained Nurses' Annuity Fund, and built and endowed almshouses on her husband's estate near Newport. She sketched well in water-colours, and her sketches formed a sort of diary of her journeys. She was an accomplished musician, playing the organ; was a good billiard player, and an excellent gardener. She died, after a long illness, at Bramfield House on 21 May 1905, and was buried in the family mausoleum beside her husband in the churchyard of Borrisnafarney, King's County, Ireland.

He was re-elected to the same seat in April 2011. Ibrahim previously worked in the federal civil service before joining politics.  Life  Ibrahim earned his school leaving certificate from Government College, Keffi. He graduated from Ahmadu Bello University and then joined the Kaduna State civil service. He was posted to the governor's office as an assistant secretary. He spent considerable years as a civil servant in the governor's office and intermittently traveled abroad to earn a diploma in economic planning and a master's degree in economics. In the late 1970s, he was transferred to the newly created state housing corporation, an outfit he championed while working at the governor's office as a means the government could use to reduce some social-economic problems such as housing. In 1979, when the Federal Capital Development Authority moved its offices from Lagos to Suleja, Ibrahim was posted as Director of Administration of FCDA. Political career Ibrahim was a senator during the Third Nigerian Republic. After the truncation of the republic, he went back to his private life. However, he belonged to some organizations that were opposed to the self succession bid of Sani Abacha. During the Fourth Nigerian republic, Ibrahim was chairman of the Katsina branch of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) for some months. He resigned from this position at the 2002 National Convention of the party after unsubstantiated allegations were made against him. Ibrahim was elected Senator for the Katsina South (Funtua) Senatorial district in April 2003 on the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) platform. In August 2006, he was expelled from the ANPP, as was former President Muhammadu Buhari, also from Katsina. Both were accused of anti-party activities and disregard for the party constitution. In April 2007, Ibrahim competed unsuccessfully for Governor of Katsina State. In February 2010, he followed the lead of Muhammadu Buhari in resigning from the ANPP. He competed in the April 2011 elections to become Senator for Katsina South (Funtua) on the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) platform. He received 324,652 votes, defeating the People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Tukur Ahmed Jikamshi, who trailed with 198,927. Jikamshi was formerly deputy governor of the state. Ibrahim was involved in merger negotiations between CPC and Action Congress and was an intermediary between Bola Tinubu of AC and Buhari of CPC. The negotiations fell through at the time, only to re-emerge prior to the 2015 elections. Ibrahim became deputy minority chief whip of the senate between 2011 and 2015. He introduced a citizens' rights bill that allowed residents who have domiciled in a location for more than twenty years to be recognized as indigenes of the community. In 2015, he was returned to the senate under the All Progressive Congress, a merger of AC, CPC and some politicians from PDP.

During the course of the feud, Carlowitz had hundreds of pigs, belonging to the bishop's subjects, driven away in order to pursue his claims, which explains the rather unusual name of the feud. In 1555 the brother of Hans of Carlowitz, Nicolas II of Carlowitz, Bishop of Mei√üen, died. He was succeeded by Bishop John IX of Haugwitz. Because of the bishop's inheritance, a dispute arose between him and the dead brother's sons, in particular Hans von Carlowitz and Zuschendorf. The Carlowitzes feuded with the new bishop and hunted him out of his residenz at Stolpen. A small body of armed men invaded the villages around Stolpen and Wurzen and caused considerable damage. According to tradition, 700 pasturing swine were alleged to have been driven off. In 1558, because there was no longer anywhere in his estate where the bishop was safe, he had to flee from his enemy to Prague. Finally the dispute was mediated by Prince-Elector Augustus. According to the settlement agreed, Hans von Carlowitz was reputedly given 4,000 gulden from the bishop for expenses incurred. With that, the last feud in Saxony came to an end. In St. Mary's Church, Dohna, is a tomb with a sculpture of the main instigator of this feud, the knight, Ritter Hans of Carlowitz, whose noble line were vassals of the burgraves of Dohna until the downfall of the Burgraviate of Dohna.

Its goal is to immerse individuals into what is called a lifelike experience. It gets as close as possible to real life behavior, appearance, senses, etc., therefore enabling its subject to experience what is happening as if it were real. In other words, simulating reality with its physical laws is the objective of lifelike experience. Definition Lifelike experience is an idea which has evolved since the time when a painting was considered lifelike. Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci‚Äôs Mona Lisa is famous for the ambiguity of the subject's expression, the monumentality of the composition, and the subtle modeling of forms and atmospheric illusionism which contributed to the continuing fascination of the work. A whole painting technique has been created pursuing the goal of the lifelike art form, called trompe-l'≈ìil, involving extremely realistic imagery in order to create the optical illusion that the depicted objects appear in three dimensions. However, this perception was replaced by photographs and then by digital ones that resemble reality even further. Today, a digital picture is considered closer to lifelike if it is compared to a raw painting. It is the same pattern with motion pictures compared to still photos and with 3D movies compared to 2D films. Each new medium or technology brings people closer to a truer lifelike experience. There is only one thing which remains consistent ‚Äì people must consider the experience suits real life laws. For example, to be absolutely lifelike, a digital guitar must behave exactly the same way the real object does: if someone plays the E string with a plectrum on the fifth fret, it will produce an A note with a particular sound. This same action will produce a different sound with fingerstyle technique. If someone decides to burn the guitar, it will burn in a predictable way according to its materials, the environment, the combustible, and other factors. Consequently, anything said to be lifelike has to comply with real life rules. It only conceptualizes real life to reproduce it, using laws of physics, chemistry, etc. to make it the experience lifelike. Another example would be a digital ball staying up in the air or floating. This would not be lifelike since it ignores gravity. Its movement needs to fit nature‚Äôs laws, thus falling on the ground and then bouncing in a specific direction, according to its initial place and applicable forces. Going further would be adding every human sense: sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. Several works have been done (or are undergoing) to try to simulate each one. For example, haptic technology attempts to emulate physical contact by taking advantage of a user's sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. Development Although almost anything can be considered as lifelike according to people‚Äôs perception, digital products have initially been thought of and developed to virtually prototype expensive goods, thus modeling what could be the final physical product. This process allows creators to find beforehand what could be its design, engineering, regulatory or other issues. Architects can also use lifelike experience to prototype a building and its environment. For example, they would use maps to represent a city to build, trying to maximize road traffic, thus avoiding traffic jam. Today, very sophisticated software does this as accurately as possible. Whether they are in 3D, use augmented reality or not, their purpose is to virtually model desired goods and then modify them to eventually reach the final version, hopefully problem-free. Just like serious games, this constitutes a ‚Äúradical fictional work‚Äù - both consumers and companies can improve their experience using lifelike products. Companies can create products more efficiently. On the other hand, their consumers can try them out, without the geographical constraint of a real-life store, without being afraid of breaking the products, etc. This gap between old and new lifelike products is based on virtual reality, i.e. computer-simulated environments. Examples =Films= Examples in film included The Matrix, where most of the characters pass from the real world to the Matrix, a virtual one. Characters interact with objects and people (more generally, a whole world) that look and act real, but are in fact virtual. They illustrate the goal of the lifelike concept ‚Äì allowing people to enjoy reality with improved possibilities such as looking at a product from any perspective, testing its strength, checking whether it suits them or not, changing its color instantly, etc. Another example is the movie Inception, which depicts lifelike experience through the world of dreams. =Military applications= As video games have grown in popularity during the last two decades, the British Armed Forces uses them to prepare their soldiers for different situations they may face. Even if modern technology is still not powerful enough to create a perfect lifelike experience, most military personnel underlined how useful it was to learn through lifelike experience software in addition to their classical training. It can be seen in the James Bond film Die Another Day, where the introduction scene is actually a virtual-reality-based lifelike experience training. =Applications in everyday life = One of the most common applications of lifelike experiences in everyday circumstances is when people learn how to drive. For example, driving students in France must pass an exam by answering questions accompanying a screen representing a driving situation (i.e. the screen shows a one-way street and the question is whether or not the user can go in). This represents a lifelike situation where contestants have to answer according to real life laws (the code of the road).

Early life Courtenay was the son of Colonel Francis Courtenay, MP for Devonshire from 1689 to 1699, and his wife Mary Boevey, daughter of William Boevey (died 1661), of Flaxley Abbey, Gloucestershire. The Boevey family was of Netherlandish Huguenot descent. Mary's brother was John Boevey (died 1706) who refers to himself in his will dated 6 March 1703 National Archives prob 11/492 as \\"John Boevey of Powderham Castle\\". Courtenay's father died in 1699, predeceasing his own father Sir William Courtenay, 1st Baronet. Courtenay succeeded his grandfather in 1702 to the baronetcy and the estate of Powderham Castle. He married Lady Anne Bertie, daughter of James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon on 13 July 1704. Career Courtenay first stood for Parliament at Honiton at the first general election of 1701. He was defeated, but was then returned unopposed for Devonshire at the second general election of 1701. He was returned again unopposed in the general elections of 1702, 1705, and 1708. He was a moderate Tory, but opposed the impeachment of Dr. Sacheverell in 1710. He stood down at the 1710 general election in favour of Sir William Pole, but when Pole had to submit to re- election on appointment to office, Courtenay was pressured by popular demand to stand again. He defeated Pole by a massive majority at the by-election on 22 July 1712. He was returned unopposed at the 1713 general election. From 1714 to 1716 he served as Lord Lieutenant of Devon. He was returned as a Tory at the 1715 general election and was returned unopposed again at the succeeding general elections in 1722, 1727 and 1734. Death and legacy Courtenay died on 6 October 1735. He directed his body to be buried in the north aisle of Powderham Church \\"near the monument there erected\\".

The region around Mollie experienced an economic \\"boom\\" period because of the discovery of gas and crude oil. Mollie was a stop along the Fort Wayne, Cincinnati, and Louisville Railroad‚Äîand happened to be near the region's oil fields, a convenient location for the area's oil workers. Mollie's location on the railroad line was approximately halfway between the two largest cities in Blackford County: Hartford City and Montpelier. In addition to the oil fields, the area was also fertile farmland. Two county roads intersected at Mollie, making it well-located for area farmers as well as the oil workers. The small community had a feed mill, a grocery, a Post Office, and a livestock station. The sole manufacturing facility was a brick and tile mill. Mollie's significance, in addition to its participation in the Indiana Gas Boom and its railroad station, is that Mollie is thought to be the site of the first aircraft landing in Blackford County.Goodspeed's 1972 article in the Marion Chronicle-Tribune. The Goodspeed article was also quoted on page 117 of A History of Blackford County‚Ä¶, and the Blackford Wells Tracer (Volume 10, Issue 4, page 3) quoted the A History of Blackford County‚Ä¶ article. Most of the small community's growth and demise is linked to the Indiana Gas Boom. Two other factors were minor contributors to Mollie's decline. First, the depletion of the raw material used in the community‚Äôs tile manufacturing factory meant that Mollie lost its only manufacturer. A second factor was the automobile. Improvements in modern highway systems, automobile reliability, and automobile availability made people less dependent on railroads for transportation‚Äîdiminishing Mollie's value as a stop along a railroad line. Today (2011), none of the community‚Äôs commercial buildings remain. Two houses are located nearby‚Äîincluding one that was built using bricks made from the community's tile mill. Interurban lines declined in popularity in Indiana during the 20th century, and a line serving Mollie was removed in the 1940s. Although the track that was the Mollie railroad spur is gone, freight trains operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway still operate over the adjacent main line.  History  The small East Central Indiana village named Mollie was located in the Harrison Township section of Blackford County, at the intersection of county roads 400 North and 300 East.Monfort. (This 1980 article in the Hartford City News-Times misspelled \\"Mollie\\" as \\"Molly\\".) A railroad line passes very close to the intersection. A former resident, interviewed in 1972, believes the community was named after an early resident named Mollie, but she cannot recall Mollie's surname.Goodspeed's 1972 article in the Marion Chronicle-Tribune. The community was essentially a small informal cluster of houses around a train station, and it was never officially platted. =Gas boom= In 1887, natural gas was discovered in nearby Hartford City, and Blackford County began its participation in the Indiana Gas Boom.A History of Blackford County..., p. 46. More importantly for Mollie, oil was discovered north of Hartford City in Harrison Township. Blackford County's first oil well began producing during 1890 in Harrison Township south of Montpelier, Indiana (which is north of Mollie). By the mid-1890s, about two thirds of Harrison Township (25 square miles) was considered part of an oil- producing region. Nearby Montpelier was thought to be \\"the very heart of the greatest natural gas and oil field in the world\\".A History of Blackford County..., p. 90, quoting the November 19, 1895 edition of the Montpelier Herald. Mollie's location along Blackford County's north-south railroad line is about from Hartford City and from Montpelier.Goltra, p. 79. This page lists the distance for railroad sidings in Hartford City, Mollie, and Montpelier from Fort Wayne. Differences in those mileages can be used to calculate the approximate distance by railroad between the Blackford County communities. During the Indiana Gas Boom, Mollie's location was ideal for men working in nearby oil fields.Indiana State Board of Agriculture, page 279. Thus, Mollie had the fortune during the 1890s of being located between two boomtowns, having an oil field nearby, and having railroad service. =Post office= Mollie's Post Office was established October 19, 1888. Henry H. Dean was the first postmaster, and this Post Office lasted for about one year before it was discontinued. The Post Office restarted on February 6, 1890, with Anderson Hatfield as the postmaster. It was housed in the front of Jacob Burnworth's grocery store. This Post Office became especially useful for workers in the nearby oil fields because mail could be easily sent and retrieved using the railroad. Although the grocery building burnt to the ground in 1891, the facility was rebuilt. The United States Official Postal Guide lists the Mollie Post Office as one of seven Post Offices in Blackford County during 1895.United States Post Office Department, p. 580. In addition to the Post Office, the grocery building had a small waiting room for railroad passengers. Mollie's Post Office was discontinued in February 1907, and area mail began being handled by nearby Hartford City's Post Office.\\"A Postoffice is Wiped Out,\\" Hartford City Evening News, February 7, 1907. (The article's headline spelled \\"Post Office\\" as \\"Postoffice\\".) Although the Mollie Post Office was busy during the earlier years when the Blackford County oil field operations were significant, Postmaster Jacob Burnworth felt that decreased business made it a \\"waste of time\\" to continue. Despite the closing of the Mollie Post Office, the grocery housed in the same building continued, as did the waiting station for the interurban that was also located in the building. In 1914, burning soot caused the grocery store building to burn to the ground.Two Fires Do $3,500 Damage. =Aircraft landing= Near the end of World War I, an army biplane was forced to land near Mollie because of engine failure. This was exciting news in Blackford County, and people paid to ride the trolley (interurban line) to Mollie to see the aircraft. A county historian believes this was one of the first, if not the first, aircraft to land in Blackford County. Geography Mollie is considered part of East Central Indiana and Northern Indiana. It is located about south of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and about northeast of Indianapolis.Based on 4 miles south of Montpelier, and mileages from the Montpelier, Indiana web site . Beneath the soil of Mollie lies the Trenton Oil and Gas Field responsible for the Indiana Gas Boom.See Rupp's Oil and Gas in Indiana web page. Oil production from the Trenton Field, which affected Mollie more than the production of natural gas, peaked around 1904. Future Northern Indiana, including what became Harrison Township and Mollie, was flattened by two glaciers millions of years ago.A History of Blackford County..., pp. 8-9. These glaciers are also responsible for the rich Blackford County farmland, which includes the land surrounding Mollie.A History of Blackford County..., p. 10. \\"Standard cereals, wool and live stock\\" were the products of the area farms during Mollie's more prosperous years in the 1890s.Blatchley, p. 71 One hundred years later, the region is still agriculture-oriented. Soybeans and corn are the most popular crops grown in Blackford County, and over (60%) are devoted to these two crops according to a survey from the 1990s.Purdue University's Indiana CropMAP web site. Additional crops and livestock are also grown in Blackford County. Demographics Milestone years in Mollie's history are 1870, when the railroad line was completed; 1878, when leading-citizen Jacob Burnworth moved to Blackford County; 1888, when the Mollie Post Office opened; 1890, when the first oil well was successfully drilled between Montpelier and Mollie; and 1907, when the Mollie Post Office closed because of the end of the Gas (and oil) Boom. These events outline the rise, and the beginning of the decline, of the community. Population patterns can be expected to follow this outline. Census information is not directly available for Mollie. Residents of Mollie were counted as part of Blackford County's Harrison Township, and the \\"Name of incorporated city, town, or village, within the above named division\\" heading on the census page was left blank. The population in 1890 for the entire Harrison Township less the city of Montpelier was 1,900. This would include farms, Mollie, and other small villages similar to Mollie. For the year 1900, the census lists the population for Harrison Township less the city of Montpelier as 1,867.Twelfth Census of the United States, Statistics of Population, Minor Civil Divisions, Table 5. Based on entries in a county directory, Mollie was populated by at least 15 households in 1902.This is based on listings in Dale's Gazetteer less duplicate entries. Using the Mollie households listed in the county directory, and census counts for each matching Harrison Township household, Mollie's unofficial population must have exceeded 55 in 1900.Dale's Gazetteer and the Twelfth Census of the United States, State of Indiana, Blackford County, Harrison Township, Sheets 5 through 9. The 1900 Census is probably the census that is closest to Mollie's peak year for population. The oil part of the Indiana Gas Boom was just beginning in 1890, and the boom was already over by 1910‚Äîas evidenced by the closing of the Mollie Post Office in 1907. Mollie's population has been estimated to have a peaked around 25 during the 1920s, less than half of the probable population in 1900. Over the next 50 years the population continued to decline, and by the 1970s, Mollie consisted of just two houses. Mollie's population in 1972 was 4‚Äîincreasing to 5 people in 1980. Economy Mollie in Blackford County portion of 1890s railroad map.Mollie's economy was centered on its railroad stop and agriculture. Mollie had a grain elevator, and grain and hay raised by area farmers were shipped out via the railroad. Mollie‚Äôs railroad facility, and the Mollie stockyard, were used by area farmers to ship livestock. Farmers on horseback, and on foot, would drive cattle or hogs down the county roads to Mollie's stockyard. Livestock were typically shipped to stockyards in New York or Chicago.A History of Blackford County..., p. 117. Some livestock, such as lambs from the west, also came into Mollie by rail. Mollie's only manufacturing facility was a tile mill.This tile factory is pictured on page 117 of A History of Blackford County.... Drainage tiles were important in Blackford County during the 19th century because of the original swampy condition of the land.A History of Blackford County‚Ä¶, page 11. \\"At first there was much swampy undrained land in the county.\\" The tile mill manufactured drain tile, building blocks, and bricks. At least one of the two houses still standing in the Mollie was built by using bricks from the local tile factory. Tile mill products could easily be shipped on the nearby railroad. Other businesses in Mollie included the general store, a cider mill, and a blacksmith shop. These businesses had extra demand for their services during the Indiana Gas Boom, when numerous oil field workers worked nearby. Infrastructure Mollie is located at the intersection of county roads 400 North and 300 East. A railroad passes very close to the intersection. During the late 19th Century and early 20th Century, passenger and freight trains stopped in the small community. A grain elevator and stockyard were located nearby, serving the area farmers. Livestock was transported to and from the area. Other buildings in Mollie included the tile factory, grocery store, cider mill, and a blacksmith shop. In later years, the grocery store was described as a ‚Äúgeneral store‚Äù.Two Fires Do $3,500 Damage. The store, owned by Jacob Burnworth, is called a general store instead of a grocery store in this 1914 newspaper article. A community as small as Mollie could not justify having a hospital. However, Mollie had at least one registered physician, Doctor H. B. Reed.Indiana State Board of Medical Registration..., p. 71. =Railroad= An 1890s locomotive. Located in Mollie next to the intersection of the two county roads is a railroad line. This line was authorized in 1849, and connects the Indiana cities of Fort Wayne and Muncie‚Äîrunning through the Blackford County communities of Montpelier, Mollie, and Hartford City (see railroad map).Biographical and historical record of Jay and Blackford Counties...., pp. 759-760. Although work constructing the railroad line began in the 1850s, it was not completed (by connecting Fort Wayne to Muncie) until 1870. The original company was named Fort Wayne & Southern Railroad Company, but by the time the railroad began operations, it was named Fort Wayne, Cincinnati & Louisville Railroad. (Most of the \\"Louisville\\" part of the name can be seen on the railroad map herein.) The Lake Erie and Western Railroad acquired the Fort Wayne, Cincinnati & Louisville Railroad in 1890, and both names were used to describe the railroad during Mollie's more prosperous years.Goltra, p. 14.The railroad changed ownership and names more than once, and was also known as the Lake Erie and Western Railroad, the Nickel Plate Road, and the Norfolk and Western Railway. It is currently (2011) part of the Norfolk Southern Railway. These names are discussed in A History of Blackford County‚Ä¶, pp. 18-19. A short piece of railroad track branched off from the main line to enable the loading and unloading of railcars in Mollie. The Mollie \\"loading track\\" was listed in 1895 as having a length of .Goltra, p. 79. Another short branch line, the Manhattan Oil spur, was located nearby. Although these branch lines have been removed, trains still operate over the main line. Around 1905, an interurban line began running parallel to the railroad. The interurban, called the trolley by the locals, connected with Montpelier to the north and Hartford City to the south.Goodspeed. Goodspeed calls the interurban line a \\"trolley system\\". Automobiles gradually replaced interurbans as the popular choice for passenger transportation. Blackford County's interurban was removed in the early 1940s.A History of Blackford County‚Ä¶, p. 19. Notable people Mollie's leading resident during the Indiana Gas Boom era was Jacob Burnworth, who moved to Blackford County in 1878.Shinn, page 185. The Burnworth portion of Shinn's book has been reproduced on the web. (scroll down) Burnworth also owned Mollie's two major enterprises: the grocery store and the tile factory. The building that housed the grocery also had additional purposes. The Mollie store also housed a small waiting station for the interurban and a post office. Burnworth served as the Mollie post master, and he was also a Justice of the Peace for Harrison Township. He died in 1917 at the age of 76.\\"Jacob Burnworth, 76, is Dead at Mollie,\\" Hartford City Evening News, August 13, 1917.Owen, p. 136.  Decline  Site of extinct village named Mollie At the beginning of the 20th century, the Indiana Gas Boom gradually came to an end.Glass and Kohrman, page 91. The end of the Gas Boom was difficult for many small communities, and it was a major cause of Mollie's decline. Unlike some communities, Mollie did not have manufacturers that were dependent upon the low-cost energy provided by the abundant natural gas. However, the loss of the oil workers in the nearby Harrison Township oil fields meant that consumer demand in Mollie was significantly diminished. By 1907, Mollie's Post Office was discontinued because of lack of demand‚Äîthe oil workers had moved away. Elsewhere in the county, the gas and oil workers left, some of the manufacturers moved, and some of the service industries were forced to close or cut back. According to the United States Census, Blackford County's population peaked at 17,123 in 1900, and it still has not returned to that zenith 100 years later.Forstall, p. 50. Mollie was still listed on maps during the 1920s, but its decline was already two decades old.Historic Map Works web page for Blackford County during the 1920s. Other contributors to Mollie's demise concerned Jacob Burnworth and his tile factory. Burnworth was Mollie's leading citizen and entrepreneur. He owned the town's general store (which also contained the interurban station), and tile factory. The clay used by the tile factory became depleted, and the tile factory was moved to Hartford City. Burnworth died August 12, 1917, at the age of 76. A smaller factor to affect Mollie was the automobile. During the 20th Century, the quality of automobiles and roads improved‚Äîresulting in the decline of interurban lines and passenger service on the railroads. The last interurban train ran on January 18, 1941.A History of Blackford County..., p. 19. Passenger service on the Lake Erie and Western Railroad line (owned by the Nickel Plate Road by that time) had already been discontinued in 1931. Many small towns, including Mollie, had started as stops on railroad lines. The automobile contributed to the decline of the railroad as a major provider of passenger transportation. It also changed ‚Äúbusiness and shopping patterns at the expense of the small-town merchant‚Äù.McIlwraith and Muller, p. 336. In 1972, Mollie's population was down to 4 people, and the community consisted of two houses. A \\"Welcome to Mollie, pop. 4\\" sign was kept nearby for the amusement of passing motorists.Goodspeed. A picture of the sign is included in Goodspeed's article. The sign is also displayed on page 117 of A History of Blackford County... = Remains of the site = The land once occupied by the Mollie community, located at the intersection of Blackford County roads 400 North and 300 East, is now farmland and owned privately. All commercial buildings have been demolished. Although the interurban line is gone, the railroad line is still in service. Norfolk Southern Railway owns and operates the railroad line, which still connects the cities of Montpelier and Hartford City with each other and points throughout North America. (See photo‚Äîthe track was undergoing maintenance work at the time the picture was taken.)

Career  Bowman served as a member of three United States military bands, two of which were premier ensembles for their respective services. Bowman served as solo euphonium in the United States Navy Band from 1970 to 1974. This was followed by a two-year period serving with a joint ensemble, the United States Armed Forces Bicentennial Band. He completed his career with the United States Air Force Band, serving from 1976 to 1991. Bowman was first to perform a recital on euphonium at Carnegie Hall in New York. He also was the first guest euphonium artist at the Leonard Falcone International Tuba and Euphonium Festival at Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp in Twin Lake, Michigan. Bowman has recorded dozens of ensemble performances in addition to six solo albums on euphonium. He has recorded many new works for euphonium, many of which were written specifically for the instrument. One of the albums, reviewed in The New Records in 1979 was described as containing all music that seemed to \\"exist just to have something for the euphonium to play\\". While going on to describe Bowman as \\"a master of his instrument\\", the review of the compositions was not favorable. Professional career Bowman broke new ground in the American understanding of the euphonium and has been called \\"The most famous euphonium soloist in the world today\\". He became known for a \\"warm, velvet tone\\" and promoted a style of playing described as \\"traditional vibrato... balanced by... clean and impressive technique, from-the-heart expressiveness, and a sense of calm assurance\\". He advanced this new image of the instrument through his performances of new literature, premiering 4 of the 7 such works commissioned by the former Tubists Universal Brotherhood Association (TUBA) now known as the International Tuba Euphonium Association. He served as its president, and was the first euphonium player to do so. Bowman has been involved in the evolution of the instrument. He has served as a consultant for the design of euphonium mouthpieces to the Swiss-based Willson Musical Instrument Company, whose products are distributed in North America by Getzen. He has been instrumental in DEG Music Products, which released a line of mouthpieces bearing Bowman's name. Bowman has been on the music faculty at the University of North Texas College of Music for years (since August 1999), where he is a Regents Professor. He was head of the Brass Department at Duquesne University (1992‚Äì1999). Bowman has served on the faculty of seven other universities. He continues to perform as a member of several ensembles and serves as a guest instructor and clinician frequently.

Henry Meyer (12 June 1780 - 28 May 1847)Presentation papers Christ's Hospital - Guildhall Library: London was an English portrait painter, more known as a stipple and mezzotint engraver. Meyer was born John Meyer in London - a son of John Meyer and Anna Torade Hoppner who married at St James Westminster 22 December 1767. Contrary to other accounts Henry Meyer's father was a hairdresser and not an engraver.Presentation papers Christ's Hospital - Guildhall Library: LondonJoseph Farington recorded that Henry Meyer was a nephew of John Hoppner, referring to him as 'Mier' (8 February 1810), and in the obituary of Meyer in Gentleman's Magazine (1847 ii 665).Anthony J. Camp - Addenda and Corrigenda Portrait of Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin, 19th century, by Meyer A prominent early 19th-century artist, Henry Meyer was admitted as a pupil to Christ's Hospital, London in 1791 where he studied under Benjamin Green. On 25 August 1794 he was apprenticed to Benjamin Smith for seven years and ultimately trained in engraving techniques at the Royal Academy Schools under Francesco Bartolozzi. His first published engravings appeared in the early 19th century attributed to J. H. Meyer, he later dropped the J and most of his works were published under the name Henry Meyer or H. Meyer. In the ensuing years he showed his skill at portraits and decorative subjects. He produced engravings of such notables as Lady Hamilton, Admiral Nelson, Sir John Nicholl, Lord Hawkesbury, Lord Byron, and Giuseppe Ambrogetti. His painting of Charles Lamb was hung in the India Office for many years. He was a founding member of the Society of British Artists, exhibiting many of his works with this association between 1824 and 1830, and acting as its president in 1828/9. Bernard Francis Hoppner Meyer Meyer is not to be confused with his son Bernard Francis Hoppner Meyer (20 April 1811 ‚Äì 3 June 1888) who, also as an artist and engraver, published his work under the name Hoppner Meyer. Hoppner Meyer emigrated to America in 1830. By adopting this name later accounts have unfortunately confused these two artists including the misconception that his father Henry was the artist who painted President Andrew Jackson. Henry Meyer should also not be confused with another son, Henry Meyer who was born 24 July 1817 and died no later than 1871 and most probably in 1866. Henry Meyer (b1817), also an artist and engraver, is likely to have adopted the name Henry Hoppner Meyer in later life to further his career adding to the confusion over Henry Meyer's name. All contemporary accounts establish that Henry Meyer never published his work under the name Henry Hoppner Meyer in his lifetime.

This is an exhibition about the Statue of Liberty, and a walkway parallel to the main entrance. It opened with the park in 1992. The area keeps visitors dry and warm during rain. Original concept and design When Imagineers were working on the creation of the European Disney resort, they had to envision a Main Street that would cope with the changing climate of the region of Paris. Although a huge Victorian-style glass roof covering the street could be built as in Tokyo Disneyland, the decision was made to build two covered walkways parallel to Main Street instead. In the very early days of Disneyland in Anaheim, Walt Disney had imagined two streets adjacent to Main Street, respectively named Liberty Street (themed to American values and history) and Edison Square (themed to this inventor's achievements). Although they were never made reality, these ideas became inspiration for both Arcades in Paris. As such, Imagineers came up with'Liberty Arcade, themed to the lasting friendship between France and the United States and embodied by Lady Liberty, and Discovery Arcade, themed to inventions of the 19th Century. Liberty Arcade The Arcade is a long walkway, from Town Square to Central Plaza, taking people behind Main Street shops and restaurants. It is divided into three parts: * The first is an exhibition presenting the making of the Statue by Fr√©d√©ric Auguste Bartholdi and Gustave Eiffel. Showcase windows, paintings and rare items are displayed. * The second part, known as Liberty Court, is the central part of the Arcade. This rotunda, ornamented with American and French flags and Victorian paintings promoting the Statue's dedication ceremony, is accompanied by a dark room. In this dark room, guests can behold, through a glass window, a recreation of the inauguration of Lady Liberty, complete with wax figures commenting on the event and the recording of U.S. President Grover Cleveland's speech. * The third part resembles the first one, but deals with the Statue becoming a World symbol. Showcase windows present Ellis Island, or the rededication of the Statue in 1986.

Biography Harold Saunders Blackham was born in London, England; his father William George Blackham was an Ulster Protestant from Newry, while his mother was an Englishwoman named Evison Elizabeth Saunders. An uncle of his was Robert J. Blackham who was the Surgeon General to the British Army in Ireland. The Blackham family were Protestant, which Hugh rebelled against when he converted to the Catholic Church, in accord with the Ne Temere decree of 1907, to enable him to marry Mary McCarville of County Monaghan (with whom he had two sons Eoin and Carol). De Blacam became involved in the Gaelic League while in London. Blackham Gaelicized his name to Aodh Sandrach de Bl√°cam or Hugh de Bl√°cam, despite his non-Gaelic ethnic origin.

Cann Office Hotel Llangadfan is home to St Cadfan's church, a medieval church whose original features have been obscured by a 19th century restoration. The church was originally said to have been established by Saint Cadfan (who had to flee under pressure from Franks with his companions) somewhere between 510 and 515, shortly before he departed and founded a monastery on Bardsey Island where he served as its abbot from 516‚Äì542. This church was the seat of the Parish of Llangadfan for centuries, then being part of the County of Montgomeryshire. ;Features of St Cadfan's church St Cadfan's church, in the Diocese of St Asaph, located 14 miles to the west of Welshpool, originally of 15th century medieval vintage, was restored in 1867‚Äì68. It has been built over a raised sub-circular churchyard which was expanded in 1910 in the western direction. It has a small single chamber (a nave and chancel) with an east facing window in east west layout. While the porch (southern direction), vestry (in the northern direction), chancel arch, new windows, and bell turret ( on the west, over the nave) belong to the nineteenth century restoration, a stoup and a few other older structures are still visible. Stone masonry with square blocks of greyish shale siltstone is irregularly coursed in the porch, the vestry and the bell turret and fully plastered. The roof (gabled to the east and west) is made of slates with black ceramic red ridge tiles with a cross finial to chancel. Peaked arches with louver boards are provided on the Northern and southern sides. The north wall has three windows, \\"two to the nave, one to the chancel; each has a two-centred arch with two trefoiled two-centred lights of grey freestone; and continuous hoodmoulds ending in head stops and having a central stop as well.\\" Cobblestone floor is provided inside the church. The roof is made of timber where rafters and purlins are exposed. The north and south walls are fitted with wooden benches fixed over stone plinths. The main entrance to the church is through a pair of wrought iron gates set in stone pillars in the north-west wall, which is the main entrance. Entry to the church is also through a gravelled path from the lychgate. The southern wall has stone steps which lead to Tyn-llan (a public house in the past). Church yard is closed within a boundary wall except the extended part of western end of the church. There is an earthen bank of 1 m height, which delimits the earlier boundary of the church where there is a lychgate made of stone. The church yard has plantation of many trees of yews, sycamores and ashes; some are dated to 1732. =Other buildings= One of the buildings of Llangadfan, Abernodwydd, a timber-framed house originally built in 1678, has been removed and re-erected at the St Fagans National History Museum, near Cardiff. In 1849, the village was said to contain a mansion and 1931 acres of land. The Cann Office Hotel dates back to at least the 17th century when it was a post office known as the \\"Can Office\\". It later became an inn, and the chief village pub and restaurant. Some interesting ancient artefacts have been unearthed in the Llangadfan area, including a stone implement unearthed during a drain maintenance job in August 1931 and a bronze palstave which was discovered in the spring of 1833 in the second field from Parc farmhouse.

Sugrue in which he examines the role race, housing, job discrimination, and capital flight played in the decline of Detroit. Sugrue argues that the decline of Detroit began long before the 1967 race riot. Sugrue argues that institutionalized and often legalized racism resulted in sharply limited opportunities for African Americans in Detroit for most of the 20th century. He also argues that the process of deindustrialization, the flight of investment and jobs from the city, began in the 1950s as employers moved to suburban areas and small towns and also introduced new labor-saving technologies. The book has won multiple awards including a Bancroft Prize in 1998. Awards Origins of the Urban Crisis won the 1998 Bancroft Prize in American History, the 1996 Social Science History Association President's Book Award for a first work by a beginning scholar, the 1996 Philip Taft Prize in Labor History, and the 1997 Urban History Association Prize for Best Book in North American Labor History.
